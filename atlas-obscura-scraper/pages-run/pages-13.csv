0,Jason de Caires Taylor's Underwater Sculpture Garden,"Saint George's, Grenada",A gallery of underwater art that can be visited by man and fish alike.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/underwater-sculpture-garden,"It’s a rare case when a piece of sculpture means as much to the surrounding wildlife as it does to the humans who come to admire it. Such is the situation of Jason de Caires Taylor’s underwater sculpture garden. Constructed out of concrete and steel, and bolted to the ocean substrate, the works here act as artificial reefs that provide “an ideal habitat for filter-feeding organisms.” Located between two and eight meters underwater, the collection of over 65 sculptures is home to a number of species, including peacock flounder, juvenile striped parrot fish, banded coral shrimp, and fire worms. The sculptures are in clear, shallow waters and can be easily seen by divers, snorkelers, and those in glass-bottomed boats. Despite the fact that some of the pieces weigh as much as 15 tons, they are not impervious to the powers of the ocean. Taylor’s first work, Grace Reef, was torn to pieces by a hurricane. But such destruction is part of the point of Taylor’s work. As the sculptures interact with their underwater environment in unpredictable ways, the art becomes more interesting and complex. Eventually, they may disappear completely into the expansive blue gallery they inhabit.  Moilinere bay, currently home to 65 sculptures, covers an area of 800sq metres. It is located two miles north of the capital St Georges on the west coast of the island, within an area designated a National Marine Park. The bay is enclosed by rock headlands and has a small beach in one corner. Within the Bay the sea ranges in depth from 0- 25m. It can be reached by land, by walking down to Dragon bay and following the beach down in a southerly direction. It is roughly a 10 minute boat ride from St Georges and 15 minutes from Grand Anse.",underwater week outsider architecture water statues
1,Cold War Relics at Pearls Airport,Grenada,"Rare signs of the former Soviet Union in the Caribbean, though not where you'd expect them.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cold-war-relics-at-pearls-airport,"Outside of Cuba, you won’t find too many signs of the old USSR around the Caribbean, a fact that makes Pearls Airport in Grenada so interesting. Pearls was Grenada’s first airport, though it hasn’t been used for commercial service in years. These days it mostly serves as a nice grazing area for local cows, goats, and curious aviation and Cold War history buffs. When the U.S. Military invaded Grenada back in 1983, Pearls was one of their primary targets. Old planes, like this Soviet crop duster with “CCCP” still barely visible on the fuselage evidence the Cold War history here.

2,Kick 'Em Jenny,Grenada,A violent name for a violent volcano.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kick-em-jenny,"Five miles north of Grenada in the West Indies, a volcano is buried 591 feet below the water’s surface in the Caribbean Sea. Unknown until 1939, when it shot steam and debris some 900 feet up into the air, Kick ‘Em Jenny is an active submerged volcano with a quite fitting name. Once the volcano made its voice heard, it caught the attention of the people of Grenada, who were tasked with devising a name for it. There are multiple theories as to the origins of the strange name they chose. Some believe that “Kick ‘Em Jenny” comes from some violent incident that a Grenadian had with a female donkey (also known as a jenny). A more obscure proposition claims the name comes from the similar sounding cay que gêne, or “the turbulent cay.” The name likely came from a small island now called Diamond Island, which, on certain maps, was also referred to as Kick ‘Em Jenny prior to 1939. Regardless of its disputed etymology, the so-named volcano is a wary concern for boats traveling in its vicinity, and, as far as we know, it remains the only live volcano in the Eastern Caribbean.",donkeys names volcanoes oceans geology
3,An Chodyè La,"Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe",A Caribbean chef recreates his enslaved great-great-grandmother's dishes inside the home she purchased after buying her freedom.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/an-chodye-la-kaz-a-soup-guadeloupe,"On an unassuming Pointe-à-Pitre street sits a quaint, bright-turquoise building that offsets Guadeloupe’s dark history of colonialism. An Chodyè La’s daily rotation of hearty, flavorful soups speaks not only to the French-Caribbean island’s diverse population, but to the resilience of its people. In an interview with Saveur, Jean-Claude Magnat, the chef behind An Chodyè La, said that the culinary makeup of his soups is rooted in the island’s history of slavery. As families survived on their enslavers’ leftovers, they married the vestiges of lavish meals in a pot with water and set everything to boil. Over time, these cooks infused a variety of their own heritage flavors and techniques into such soups. If An Chodyè La feels homey, with its local art and welcoming atmosphere, that’s because it’s actually located inside a house. Magnat’s soups are recreations of recipes originally made by his great-great-grandmother, Lucille Deris, and served out of the building she once called home. According to Garden & Gun, Deris worked washing clothes to eventually buy both her freedom and her first house in the early 19th century. Today, the cafe’s menu is conveyed verbally, an oral presentation of the colonial culinary mashup: traditional Caribbean lambi, oxtail soup, sea-snail soup, lobster bisque, and ouassous giraumon, a pumpkin soup with freshwater shrimp. It all adds up to a nice break from some of the island’s more carb-heavy or fried offerings.  The cafe is known to some locals as ""Kaz a Soup,"" so don't be surprised if you hear it called that name as well.",caribbean soup slavery islands
4,Fort Delgrès Memorial,"Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe",A stone circle on the slopes of a Caribbean volcano commemorates the leader of an anti-slavery uprising.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-delgres-memorial,"In 1802, Louis Delgrès, a free man of color born in Guadeloupe, led a doomed rebellion against Napoleon’s General Antoine Richepanse to prevent the return of slavery in the French Caribbean. Over 300 years later, the fort where he made his last stand now bears his name. Louis Delgrès was an idealist and became a distinguished soldier in many battles for the French Republic. He was even captured and sent to England as a prisoner once or twice. When, in 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte sent General Richepanse to Guadeloupe to restore it to its “pre-1789” state (i.e., to reinstate slavery), Delgrès was having none of it. He led an armed rebellion of civilians and soldiers of color. Unfortunately, the rebels were no match for the French army. They retreated into this fort, where Delgrès issued a proclamation “to the entire Universe” explaining what he was fighting for. Then, when it became clear there was no hope of victory, Delgrès and 400 of his followers holed up in a plantation on the volcano’s slope and blew themselves up, along with as many French soldiers as they could. Slavery was reinstated—though some say the rebellion’s failure motivated the successful liberation struggle in Haiti. As for General Richepanse, he got yellow fever and died a few weeks later and is now buried in the military cemetery at the very top of the fort complex. Located on the outskirts of Guadeloupe’s small hillside regional capital, Basse-Terre, the fort has stunning views of the island’s volcano and the surrounding towns and oceans. It dates back to 1649 when then Governor Charles Houël named it… Fort St. Charles. Like many spots in the Caribbean, it spent a few decades changing hands between the French and British and was at times called Royal Fort and Fort Richepanse. In 1989, the island’s governing council voted to officially rename it Fort Louis Delgrès after the leader of the heroic rebellion. The fort is pretty standard as colonial-era stone forts go, but the memorial to Louis Delgrès is something special. A sort of meditation maze meets Stonehenge, with Delgrès’ head in the center, it’s well worth the visit. If you venture into the stone spiral you’ll be able to pick out some carvings on one of the rocks that read “Liberte” and “Justice.”  It’s free to enter, and there are plaques and signage in French, so bring your translator app or phrasebook if you need one!

5,Cimetière de Morne-À-l'Eau (Cemetery of Morne-à-l'eau),"Morne-A-l'Eau, Guadeloupe","At first glance, little checkered structures on the hillside look like they house the living, not the dead.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cimetiere-de-mornealeau,"At the stunning hillside cemetery of Morne-à-l’eau (Cimetière de Morne-à-l’eau), nearly all the crypts are decorated with checkered black and white tile. If you climb to the top of the hill among the dense tombs, you can look down at what appears to be a checkered miniature cityscape. With tombs dating back to the mid-19th century, the cemetery has gotten much more inclusive over the years. Originally, only the wealthy landowners of Guadeloupe could afford to bury their dead here, but now the site is home to Gaudeloupeans of all races and classes. The tombs are shaped like little houses, and many of them include spots for the living to hangout among their ancestors. Shrines with photographs, flowers, candles, and other memorabilia are set up on shelves inside the structures. Melted candle wax covers the ground in many of the open concrete areas, presumably left from the annual All Saints Day celebration during which the cemetery is covered with thousands of candles and families gather to honor the dead and reminisce. The origin of the black and white motif is unclear. Some say it represents yin and yang, and others claim it’s a combination of black, the European color of mourning, and white, the African one. Whatever the meaning, the effect is otherworldly in an Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland-kind of way. Also unclear: how those few pink and blue tombs snuck in! The cemetery is easily accessible from the main road.",cemeteries
6,Citadelle Laferrière,Haiti,This iconic fortress was once the crown jewel of Haiti's national defense.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/citadelle-laferriere,"War creates great art. You hardly ever hear that claim being made by the often-artsy peaceniks of the world, but it’s true. Indelible, iconic images are a key result of almost any war, big or small, whether they be mesmerizing propaganda or works of evocative protest – but perhaps the creative field most benefitting from conflict (at least until the invention of the airplane bomber) is architecture. Look no further than Haiti’s Citadelle Laferrière for an example. Like so many pre-20th-century fortresses, the design of The Citadel, as it’s known locally, is as striking as it is imposing. Built on a mountaintop, as was the style in post-revolution Haiti, each aspect of the grand fort demonstrates an element of defensive strategy as much as it does a flourish of architectural innovation. The fort contained living quarters, cisterns and storage space designed to sustain 5,000 defenders for an entire year. As one travels along the road that circles up the mountain, it’s obvious that each side of the citadel is unique – this is no box-shaped castle. The rear of the citadel features a classic cylindrical rampart, the curved wall designed to stymie an enemy attack and prevent the scaling of the wall. The sides are constructed to drop off directly into the sheer mountainside, making attack from that angle virtually impossible. But the truly impressive feature is the front wall facing the road - sharp and triangular, puncturing the side of the mountain like the tip of a spear, presenting a limited profile to potential attackers. Even the location itself is strategic – the high ground of mountaintops are regularly thought of as ideal for defense, but nowhere is this more important than a small island such as Haiti, where traditional coastal fortresses would be vulnerable to attack by ships at sea. Building forts on mountaintops wasn’t just the Haitian style — it was a necessity. Unfortunately, The Citadel never realized its potential as a defensive structure – built to defend against a potential return of the French army to re-enslave the newly freed Haitian people, the French did not return with force. Now the impressive structure sits unused other than as a tourist attraction, designated a national park and an official UNESCO World Heritage Site – its 365 cannons still silent, it’s walls still looming.  The Citadel is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Haiti. Directions to and history of the fortress are provided by self-appointed guides from the town of Milot. Visitors are encouraged to rent a horse for the uphill trek. The first portion of the seven-mile (11 km) trail is navigable by 4WD vehicle, although infrequent landslides and construction projects sometimes make this unreliable. From the mid-level parking lot, the second portion must be completed either on horseback or on foot. The entire seven-mile-trail starting in Milot, almost completely uphill, can be walked by experienced hikers who carry plenty of water. Most of the interior of the Citadel fortress itself is accessible to visitors, who may also climb the numerous staircases to the fortress's roof, which is free of guardrails. On a clear day, the city of Cap-Haïtien and the Atlantic Ocean can be seen to the north.",lost tribes relics and reliquaries cultures and civilizations crime and punishment memento mori catacombs and crypts monuments ruins architectural oddities museums and collections architecture
7,Saut-d'Eau Waterfalls,"Haut Saut d'Eau, Haiti",Thousands of Haitians travel to the waterfalls to ask the Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and her voodoo counterpart Erzulie for healing in a yearly pilgrimage.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sodo,"Every year, thousands flock to Saut d’Eau Waterfalls on a religious pilgrimage to bath in the waters, asking for favors and praying for healing from the Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel. Located near Mirebalais and 60 miles north of Port au Prince, the falls became a holy place after it became widely believed that the Virgin Mary had appeared nearby on a palm tree. The palm tree was chopped down by a French priest who was rightly concerned that the cultural significance of the tree would foster a large amount of superstition, but the action was futile, and the area itself became sacred, despite his efforts. For over a century, Haitians have trekked in from miles around, even more so since the catastrophic 2010 earthquake, to ask the Virgin Mary (or the closely associated Vodou Lwa, Erzulie Dantor) for her blessings. The sick and the needy let the water of the falls wash over them as they perform various rituals of both Voodoo and Catholicism in a religious festival that lasts for three days. The festival begins in July, two days before the annual July 16th feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.",voodoo cultures and civilizations rites and rituals water
8,Sans-Souci Palace,"Milot, Haiti","The royal seat of Henri Christophe, a formerly enslaved man who became Haiti's only king.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sans-souci-palace-kingdom-haiti,"The Sans-Souci Palace was the royal residence of King Henri Christophe I of Haiti, the self-imposed monarch who as a formerly enslaved man, had fought in the American Revolutionary War alongside George Washington. He then went on to be a key leader in the Haitian Revolution in 1804, when the small nation gained independence from France. The leader of the revolution, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, named himself Governor-General-for-life and had every intention of ruling over the newly independent nation until the end of his days. Christophe however, wanted to rule. Along with other disaffected members of the administration, he conspired to have Jean-Baptiste Sans Souci killed. After Dessalines was killed, Christophe created a separate government in Plaine-du-Nord and was elected President of the State of Haiti, while one of his co-conspirators, Alexandre Pétion, was elected president in the South. Finding Governer-General-for-life a little wordy, Christophe created a kingdom and had himself proclaimed Henry I, King of Haiti. He also created a nobility and named his son Jacques-Victor Henry as prince and heir. Built in 1810 and completed in 1813, the Sans Souci Palace is located in the town of Milot. Before the construction of Sans-Souci, Milot was a French plantation. It is unknown how many laborers perished during construction of the palatial building. Now a ruin, the palace was once a bustling whirlwind of feasting and dancing, with grandiose gardens, artificial springs, and a system of waterworks. Enjoyed by many overseas guests, it had “the reputation of having been one of the most magnificent edifices of the West Indies.” In 1820, King Henry I died by suicide not long after suffering a debilitating stroke. He shot himself with a silver bullet on the grounds of the palace. He was subsequently buried in the Citadelle. His son and only heir was killed just 10 days later. A considerable part of the palace was destroyed in an 1842 earthquake, which also leveled a good part of the nearby city of Cap-Haïtien. The palace was never rebuilt.  Once considered the Versailles of the Caribbean, the ruined shell of the palace is now crumbling to the ground. However, today it is fairly safe to visit and taxis will take you right to the steps of the ruins. Local tour guides who are trained in the history of the region hang around the foot of the palace waiting to be hired. There are also plenty of stalls set up to sell you souvenirs. After you explore the ruins of Sans-Souci Palace, you can hire a taxi to take you up the mountain where you can then hire a pack horse to take you to the Citadelle.",revolution cultures and civilizations colonialism ruins architectural oddities architecture
9,Atis Rezistans,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti",A macabre sculpture museum in the capital of Haiti fuses human bones with broken metal to create challenging contemporary art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atis-rezistans,"The museum lies just off Boulevard Jn J Dessalines, in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. Set back from the main road behind a muddle of motorbikes and old cars, the wrought iron gate which marks the entrance is presided over by a human skull, red and white Christmas lights poking gaudily from its gaping eye sockets. Beneath the skull, a Latin slogan reads: “E Pluribus Unum”; out of many, one. Welcome to Atis Rezistans. The place is a museum, an art collection, and a gallery. No matter what you call it, this courtyard tucked away behind the boulevard seems to defy any standard definition. The open-air space is crammed full of sculptures, ranging from palm-sized figurines through to towering daemonic effigies that hunch menacingly over the heads of visitors. If there is one uniting theme to this collection, other than the artists’ obvious penchant for the macabre, then it is the notion of salvage and recycling. The founding sculptors of the Haitian collective, André and Celeur, grew up around the area of Grand Rue in Port-au-Prince. Born out of a climate of “junkyard make-do, survivalist recycling, and artistic endeavor,” their self-taught artistic skills reflect the challenges of growing up in such an environment. Theirs is a unique and yet well-defined artistic style, one which prescribes the juxtaposition of metal and flesh, wood and bone. The work of the Grand Rue sculptors is often challenging. Disturbing, even. Children’s dolls appear stitched onto vacuum cleaners, while twisted automobile parts have been joined to human remains to create bizarre and otherworldly totems. Now working with an expanded team of sculptors and artists, André and Celeur continue to use everyday items to tell new stories. The symbology of their work incorporates powerful themes of death and rebirth; of Vodou, Christianity and occultism; of slavery, of inevitable industrialization and its dystopian sci-fi aftermath.",sculpture gardens sculptures art
10,Jubilee Voodoo Monument,"Anse a Foleur, Haiti",Broken Catholic cross now worshiped in the voodoo faith.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jubilee-voodoo-monument,"One issue with this monument is the huge amount of varying stories surrounding it. The general consensus is that a cross was built around 200 years ago by the Catholic church. The church believed this was a way to “claim the hill for the Lord.” Sometime later (locals say from a week to 100 years), lightning struck the cross causing the upper portion to topple over the cliff-side. The locals believed this to be their gods reclaiming the hill and it has been worshipped this way ever since. Today, daily pilgrimages are made to the top to worship and make sacrifices. As you climb the hill to the top one thing to notice is the large amount of burnt rock. Very often people bring candles to burn and pray around. If visiting, be respectful. This is a place of worship, and while photos are allowed do be subtle about it. In addition, be careful. The climb up is filled with sharp boulders and many cacti. Bring proper hiking shoes to make the climb, and be sure to bring lots of water. It may not seem like a long hike, but the Haitian sun is quite dehydrating.  The monument is located 2-3 hours east of Port-au-Paix.",voodoo religion sacred spaces
11,The Forts of Dessalines,"Marchand Dessalines, Haiti",An entire town in Haiti memorializes one man and his historic revolution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dessalines-revolution-battle-haiti,"The air was still, the moment tense. A legion of ragged, weary troops watched wide-eyed and breathless as their commander shouted, demanding their very best as he waved a torch above a keg of gunpowder. Their muscles tensed each time the torch dropped a little too close, daring the gunpowder to blow – but still they watched, silently, intently, rapt as their commander explained: if this battle were lost, he would destroy the fort. If they lose here, the revolution is over, as well as their lives. It was the March 11, 1802 battle of Crête-à-Pierrot, and the commander was Jean-Jaques Dessalines – the man who would soon become the leader of the Haitian revolution. Dessalines was a former slave, as were each of the troops under his command, and their daring task was to lead history’s only slave rebellion that succeeded in establishing a fully independent country. At Crête-à-Pierrot, Dessalines and 1,300 of his troops repelled a French army battalion 18,000-strong, and broke their lines – a pivotal victor in their battle for freedom. Not long after, Dessalines would become emperor of the free nation of Haiti. His victory celebrated and slavery ended, fortifications were built atop hilltop towns as defense against attacking European armies. Perhaps the most famous of these towns was Dessalines. The capital of the new nation and a massive fortification, Dessalines was named after the leader of the rebellion, and still bears his name today. Modern Dessalines is a functioning town of more than 20,000 people, but whose historic past literally surrounds the small city. All around Dessalines are steep hills and mountains, at the top of which are historic forts that once defended the city both during and after the slave rebellion. Five forts in total, along with several historic sites and statues throughout the town, make Dessalines a living, breathing memorial to Jean-Jacques and the revolution. Each of the forts are now historic sites, still located on the mountaintops which guaranteed the security of the old imperial city and in the time after the revolution, the forts were also residences of famous figures in the history of Haiti. Located on the highest point of the hill, the fort “The End of the World” is the greatest height of the city. The fort “Innocent” was placed under the command of the first son of Dessalines, who was named Innocent. Its location could control all the Artibonite Valley. The third fort, “Madam Ti” was the home and property of the Empress, while the fort “Doco,” located in Morne Docomond, was designed to secure the fort “Madam Ti.” Finally, the fort “Flipped” stood on the slope of the hill surrounding the imperial city. It was destroyed in 1946 during construction of the road Marchand St-Michel-de-Attalaye. Today, ruins of the fort “Flipped” remain, but the grounds are frequented for voodoo ceremonies. Together, this ring of fortifications demonstrate not only how seriously the new nation of Haiti took the threat of a French return, but also how thoroughly planned and formidable their fortifications would become. Although now historic sites and ruins of a time past, the legacy of the slave rebellion lives on just as much in these reminders as they do the heart and soul of the nation’s people. The forts that now remain are an enduring part of the legend that began with a man, and his motivating insistence that he was willing to destroy those same forts if he could not have freedom.",lost tribes cultures and civilizations monuments statues ruins architectural oddities architecture
12,Sunken Pirate City at Port Royal,"Port Royal, Jamaica","Nature took her revenge on the ""Wickedest City in the World.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sunken-pirate-stronghold-at-port-royal,"“The earth opened and swallowed many people, before my face, and the sea I saw came mounting in over the wall, upon which I concluded it impossible to escape.” Edmund Heath, survivor and eyewitness to the devastating 1692 earthquake wrote these words in a letter from the safety of a ship moored in the city’s harbor, overlooking the ruins of his city. Port Royal, once called “the most wicked and sinful city in the world” was famous the world over for its booze—the blackout-inducing Kill Devil Rum, its pirates, and its sex workers. Needless to say, when the city was nearly destroyed, there were some parties that saw it as a convenient solution to an ugly problem. The English and their pirate friends were relatively new to the area. Jamaica had been held by the Spanish since Columbus first declared it “the fairest island eyes have beheld” in 1494. Lacking gold or other obvious exploitable wealth, the Spanish held it but did not focus much energy there. It came under English power in 1655, after Cromwell sent English raiders to invade and capture the Spanish stronghold at Hispaniola (now Haiti and Dominican Republic, then the center of Spanish trade in the Caribbean). Cromwell’s men failed spectacularly at taking Hispaniola and turned to Jamaica as a second choice, better-than-nothing option. Located on the southeast coast of Jamaica, the natural harbor at Port Royal became the center of English life in Jamaica. By the late 1600s it had become one of the largest European cities in the new world, second only to Boston. It had also become the infamous home of pirates, sex workers, and Englishmen on the make. Far from home, they made their livings off of the slave trade, slave labor in plantations, and the money that the pirates brought in from their looting forays against the Spanish. It may be seen as an indicator of the caliber of vice in Port Royal that in 1675 the notorious pirate Henry Morgan became the Lieutenant Governor. In fact, Morgan began to crack down on overt piracy as the grand era of privateering he had been part of began to enter its waning phase. He died just four years before the earthquake struck and was buried in the Palisadoes cemetery. On the morning of June 7, 1692, a massive earthquake estimated at a 7.5 magnitude hit the island. The city, largely built over sand, suffered instantly from liquifaction, with buildings, roads, and citizens sucked into the ground. Geysers erupted from the earth, buildings collapsed, and finally the city was hit by tsunami waves, dragging what had not been destroyed out to sea. In the end, some 33 acres of the city disappeared under water, four of the five forts were destroyed or submerged, and 2000 people were killed. The cemetery where Captain Morgan was buried slipped into the sea, its bodies floating up to mix with the freshly dead. Even before the earth stopped shaking, locals reported that the looting began, one writing: “Immediately upon the cessation of the extremity of the earthquake, your heart would abhorr to hear of the depredations, robberies and violences that were in an instant committed upon the place by the vilest and basest of the people; no man could call any thing his own, for they that were the strongest and most wicked seized what they pleased....” As news spread of the destruction of Port Royal, it was picked up as a cautionary tale and a sure sign of divine retribution for the lewd behavior of the pirates and sex workers, the pretensions and wealth of the gentry of the town, or the sins of slavery, depending on the city and the audience. But at any rate, the earthquake did not end Port Royal’s wicked ways, nor its relationship with vice or with pirates who continued to stop by for another 50 years while they preyed on Spanish ships. In fact, in 1720, John “Calico Jack” Rackham was hanged at Gallows-Point in Port Royal by order of pirate hunter—and former privateer—Woodes Rogers (best known for his rescue of the castaway Alexander Selkirk, the inspiration for Robinson Crusoe). Since then the city has been racked by fire, earthquake, and hurricane several times. The English finally decided to close its naval station at Port Royal, effectively closing it for business, and most residents left. In 1951, what was left of Port Royal was hit by Hurricane Charlie, destroying more property and leaving only a few of the original buildings standing. Today most of the remains of the 17th century city lie under up to 40 feet of water. Up until the 1900s visitors reported on the city still visible below the waves and the eerie sensation of floating over the rooftops. Since the 1950s, divers have been exploring and cataloging the submerged city. In 1969, Edwin Link discovered the most famous artifact: a pocket watch dated 1686, stopped at exactly 11:43. More recently the Nautical Archaeology Program at Texas A&M University and the Jamaica National Heritage Trust conducted underwater archaeological examinations, ending in 1990. Their explorations have brought to light artifacts of 17th century life rarely seen. Because of the nature of the disaster, which left many buildings intact and more or less undisturbed, it has been compared to Pompeii for its archaeological wonders and was a designated National Heritage Site in 1999. Special access from the government is required to dive in the restricted Port Royal ruins area, but many of the items recovered over the years can be seen at the Museums of History and Ethnography at the Institute of Jamaica in Kingston.

13,Glistening Waters,"Falmouth, Jamaica",Millions of glowing microscopic organisms light up the waters of this luminous lagoon.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glistening-waters,"A pretty enough lagoon by day, the Glistening Waters at night is an eerie, ethereal experience. Any agitation to the still, black water produces a strange and beautiful blue-green light. Boats leave shimmering waves in their wake, fish dart by like little neon lanterns and swimmers paint the water with glowing trails. The ghostly glow comes from an abundant population of microscopic dinoflagellates that thrive in the brackish lagoon, and Glistening Waters is one of only a handful of places in the world where these bioluminescent organisms can be observed and studied year-round. Dinoflagellates can be found in all the world’s oceans, occasionally in high concentrations, but these sudden surges of population are hard to predict and generally don’t last long.  The unicellular organism requires a very specific set of conditions to survive in, and it is an extremely rare and fragile ecosystem that can support them permanently.  Generally no more than eight feet deep, Glistening Waters is formed where the fresh waters of the Martha Brae River combine with the Caribbean’s saltwater, creating a warm, shallow, brackish environment that is ideal for the dinoflagellates. Vitamin B12 is another key element to their successful growth, and the red mangrove trees which line the water provide plenty for the dinoflagellates to feed on. Bioluminescence occurs as a chemical reaction within the organism when excited or disturbed by movement.  It is thought that the flashes of light are a defense mechanism, meant to startle potential predators or even attract those higher up on the food chain to prey on the smaller aquatic life that feeds on dinoflagellates. Following a circadian rhythm, the bioluminescence occurs only at night which allows the dinoflagellates to essentially recharge during the day. The more sunshine the lagoon receives during the day the brighter the organisms will glow at night, so it’s best not to visit following a rainy day or during a full moon. Bioluminescence is a fascinating phenomenon that is still not fully understood, and scientists from around the world have been drawn to Glistening Waters because it offers ideal conditions for studying dinoflagellates. As for the tourists, if the natural beauty isn’t enough of a lure,  Jamaican folklore has deemed the luminous lagoon a sort of fountain of youth.  Legend has it that women who swim in the mineral-rich waters become more beautiful and look younger, while men supposedly benefit from an increase in penis size and new levels of virility.

With the surface of the chilly water 25 feet below the land, visitors either dive in or climb down a ladder. It’s another 30 feet to the bottom. The cavernous opening is completely encased in Karst limestone, a naturally occurring mineral that filters the steady upwelling of water, leaving behind a clear, clean pool. The mud around the pool is also said to be great for the skin, and the water is valued for its mineral properties. And if you’re not brave enough to climb in, well, there’s a pool with the water from the hole pumped up to higher ground.",blue holes natural wonders water nature
15,Floyd's Pelican Bar,"Negril, Jamaica","You may get stranded and everyone's peeing in the water, but at least there's cocktails!",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/floyd-s-pelican-bar,"Hoisted on stilts above the waist deep cerulean waters of Jamaica’s Parottee Bay, Floyd’s Pelican Bar would like to serve you a “Pelican Perfection”. Located about a mile off of the coast, this water-bound watering hole looks as if it may have been nailed together by someone who was already deep in the drink. Essentially a shack made of driftwood, palm fronds, bric-a-brac and scrap wood, Floyd’s is reminiscent of someone’s clubhouse that just happens to require a boat to approach. At the end of the day, it pretty much IS someone’s clubhouse—and that someone is local fisherman Floyd Forbes. Floyd had a dream you see—a literal dream—of a bar rising out of the sea on wooden stilts, a boozy oasis in the middle of the ocean. By 2001, Floyd had made this dream reality by lugging wood out into the bay on his fishing boat, and building his dream bar one plank at a time. At first, the sea bar was essentially Floyd’s own little personal saloon where he and his fellow fisherman buddies would play some dominoes and throw back some cold ones after a day’s work. But before long, his ramshackle paradise was discovered by the local tourism industry, who helped Floyd make the place an honest-to god drinking establishment in a clear win-win deal for everyone involved. Despite this, the bar was almost closed down due to worries about environmental impact and fire hazard. However, the bar has managed to remain open after some clever legal navigation and now sports a small collection of fire extinguishers! The bar also features a huge amount of seemingly random memorabilia hanging on its walls. These trinkets feature everything from license plates from around the world to flags hung up in all corners. While you’re visiting, if you can’t bring a larger memento to hang, bring along your trusty Sharpe or pocket knife to make your mark on this wonderful, and constantly evolving, structure. One of the major attractions about the Pelican Bar, aside from its unique decor, is the warm and clear water surrounding it. The Pelican Bar itself is built on a sandbar that stretches out in all directions for a good while allowing easy walking areas. Be warned, however, that if you wander too far you may encounter sea urchins. But fear not! If you just avoid stepping on it and leave it where it is it’ll be pushed off the sandbar soon enough. These days, a 20 minute boat ride will deliver you to the Pelican Bar where you can eat, drink, sunbathe, swim, and possibly receive an invite to play some dominoes. Despite the local hotels giving the place some clout, it is, at the end of the day, a shack on stilts a mile out. There’s no restroom, you go home when a boat comes to fetch you, and while the water is warm and shallow, drunken stumble-swims home are ill-advised.  You can pay a local fisherman to take you out on his boat to the bar. These trips also frequently, but optionally, can take you down some of the near by rivers to see wildlife and even to swim.",bars shops water
16,Firewater Pond,"Runaway Bay, Jamaica",The subtle interplay of fire and water is hard to ignore at this remote Jamaican spring.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jamaica-fire-water-fire-pond,"Fire springs take rare and varying forms. The Yanar Bulag fire spring in Azerbaijan comes from water channeled through a pipe, with the resulting concentration of gases resulting in a more consistently impressive flame. Contrast that with the ever-burning Antarctic lava lake at Mt. Erbus, which simply won’t stop burning and bubbling uncontrollably, and it’s easy to find oneself desiring something in between the two. Enter Firewater Pond in St. Ann, Jamaica. Possibly inspired by the idyllic surroundings of tropical perfection, this calmly bubbling natural spring offers the perfect balance of effervescent fun when it comes to captivating interplays of fire and water. A calm grotto, a secretive location, and the gentle bubbling of the water’s surface reminds one more of an expensive spa than a flammable pool. Visitors should be careful about going for a dip, however – strong natural gasses are what causes this particular spring’s subtle bubbling, and if ignited, the gas will burn strongly and significantly. So it’s not exactly the most soothing of baths. Still impressive to locals and tourists alike, this unique spring is certainly off the beaten path compared to the crowded beaches of Montego Bay, and offers an experience not likely to be found anywhere near home.

17,Folly Ruins,"Port Antonio, Jamaica",The legend associated with these ruins understates the splendor of the mansion that once stood here.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/folly-ruins,"On a private peninsula at the mouth of the harbor of Port Antonio stand the ruins of a crumbling mansion. Once the most opulent house in Jamaica, the decaying shell has attracted its share of legends — just as one would expect from any shadow of grandiosity long since passed. Folly Ruins have been attributed to foolish and prideful man hoping to impress his bride. According to a common story, the great house was built by an American as a gift to his betrothed. In his rush to construct the mansion, he foolishly had the cement mixed with saltwater for the sake of expediency, which weakened the material and rusted the steel infrastructure. The whole building began to disintegrate soon after being built. When the rich American carried his new wife across the threshold, she saw that it was already falling apart and exclaimed, “What a folly!” She left Jamaica and never returned, and the rich man left “Folly Mansion” to crumble — like their love — back into the sand. The true story, however, is less dramatic but far more fabulous.  In the early 1900s Alfred Mitchell, a businessman from Salem, Connecticut, visited Port Antonio with his wife Annie Tiffany, an heiress to the Tiffany fortune. They fell in love with the area, and in 1905 purchased the land (which had been known as Folly Point for at 120 years by then) and began building a villa where they could spend their winters. The finished product was sprawling, lavish mansion built in the style of a Roman villa, with over 60 rooms. The extravagant mansion included a steam-powered generator, electric lights, running water, a sauna, and a wind-powered generator to pump seawater into an indoor swimming pool. The property included stables as well as a menagerie of peacocks and monkeys. Mitchell imported Jamaica’s second automobile, a Rolls Royce touring car, to take joy rides around Folly Point. Like any good legend, though, the one attached to Folly Ruins contains a kernel of truth. The entire first floor of the house was made of concrete (as high-quality lumber or bricks were difficult to come by in the area) and it seems that the concrete was, in fact, mixed with seawater. However, given that the concrete portion of the house has remained standing for over 100 years, this obviously did not cause the kind of immediate structural deterioration that the legend describes. The Mitchell family lived a comfortable, luxurious life on Folly Point until 1911, when Alfred Mitchell died at the age of 80. Annie remained at the mansion for a few years, but returned to the U.S. at the outbreak of the World War I. The land was sold but the new owner abandoned the property several years later, leading to the house being scavenged and generally falling into disrepair. The second floor collapsed due to looting and negligence in 1936. It is now owned by Jamaican government. The most lasting mark of Alfred Mitchell’s grand home is actually to be found on a nearby uninhabited island. Known officially as Wood Island, the monkeys of the Mitchells’ menagerie were free to roam, play, and multiply on the island, and thus it is now known to the locals as Monkey Island. Folly Ruins is fenced off for safety, but can be easily found and viewed from the fence. To access, turn off Alan Avenue onto a dirt road just before the cricket pitch.

18,The Prison Cell of Ludger Sylbaris,"Saint-Pierre, Martinique","The cell which saved the life of Ludger Sylbaris, ""the man who lived through Doomsday.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-prison-cell-of-ludger-sylbaris-saint-pierre-martinique,"The story of Ludger Sylbaris is so outlandish and astonishing that it is difficult to believe that it is true. In fact, his story was so amazing that Barnum & Bailey hired him to travel with the circus, not because he had an act, but because he was a sort of relic. He claimed to be the only remaining survivor of a volcano that killed an estimated 30,000–40,000 people and flattened the city of Saint-Pierre (known as the “Paris of the West Indies”) on the island of Martinique. In reality, his claim of being the only survivor isn’t entirely true. Still, his story is astonishing despite this detail. Ludger was not a nice guy. Born in 1875 on Martinique, Ludger (his actual name was Louis-Auguste) was a convicted felon who liked to drink and liked to fight. So it was no surprise when he was arrested for getting in yet another fight on May 7, 1902. Irritated with his antics, the police threw him into solitary confinement, a tiny, half-underground cell with no windows and only a very narrow slit in the door facing out to sea. The police didn’t realize it, but they had just saved Ludger’s life. The next morning, apocalypse came to Martinique. The Mt. Pelée volcano had been showing signs of erupting for over a week. Since modern vulcanology did not yet exist, no one knew what to expect.  In fact, people had been planning to have a picnic on the volcano just three days before the eruption, but had to cancel due to the ash that was starting to come down. Just before the volcano erupted, thousands came from the countryside into the city to seek refuge. That was a big mistake. Mt. Pelée exploded and a cloud of smoke darkened the sky for fifty miles around. A cloud of superheated volcanic gas and dust rolled out of the volcano at hundreds of miles per hour, destroying everything in an eight mile radius. Within a single minute the 1,075 degree pressure wave had flattened every building in the city of St. Pierre. Anyone unlucky enough to be in its way instantly caught fire and burned to death. Even those in shelters were suffocated as the wave of super heated gas burned up the oxygen and replaced it with deadly gases. People’s lungs were burned from the inside by taking even a single breath. Nearly all 30,000 residents of the city were killed instantly, and the city burned for days afterward. Ludger couldn’t have been more lucky. He was found four days after the eruption by a rescue team who heard his cries. Despite being in the safest place on the island, he was horribly burned as the air in his room had flash heated to over 1,000 degrees. Ludger described the experience of seeing the light coming through the slit grow dark, and then superheated ash flying in. He urinated on his clothes and stuffed them in the slit, but it didn’t stop the heat. Ludger wasn’t the only one to survive the eruption, however. Sailors moored off the coast are said to have survived, as well as some residents of the island who are said to have died later from their burns. Of those who lived to tell of the event, only three names are known. One was a little girl named Havivra Da Ifrile. She is said to have seen the volcano beginning to erupt, and escaped by climbing into a boat and rowing to a cave where she and her friends used to play pirates. In her words: “Before I got there I looked back—and the whole side of the mountain which was near the town seemed to open and boil down on the screaming people. I was burned a good deal by the stones and ashes that came flying about the boat, but I got to the cave.” She was found floating unconscious in a burned and broken boat two miles out at sea. Another man, Léon Compère-Léandre, is said to have survived as well, though not much is known about him. It is unclear exactly how he survived. His own account describes being in a house during the disaster, but most scientists think that this is unlikely, and that he must have been saved by jumping (or being blown into) the ocean. He was thought to be a madman when he showed up naked and burned in the town of Fort-de-France. Leon’s luck was the opposite of Ludger’s, and he was nearly killed by the volcano twice more during subsequent explosions. He eventually died from a fall. Ludger’s luck, on the other hand, couldn’t have been better. After surviving the volcano he was pardoned for his crimes, and hired to tour with Barnum & Bailey and tell the story of the horrific events he’d experienced. Ludger became something of a celebrity and was known as “the man who lived through Doomsday” and “the Most Marvelous Man in the World.” It is thought by some that the night he was imprisoned he was actually being put away for murder, which was why he was in solitary, but that Ludger later told everyone it was just because of a fight. Either way, the eruption was Ludger Sylbaris’ savior. Today, the cell which saved Ludgers life can be visited in St. Pierre. The town never recovered from the devastation. Even today, over 100 years later, the town’s population is only a few thousand. Pelée is one of the most active volcanoes in the West Indies, and it will likely erupt again.",fiery wonders disaster areas prisons subterranean sites geological oddities islands monuments geology ruins

After he proclaimed himself Emperor in 1804, she also  became the first Empress of the French. On the Caribbean island of Martinique, the French territory where Joséphine was born, a statue of the former empress stands, defaced. Born in 1763, Joséphine was the eldest daughter of a French aristocrat who owned a sugarcane plantation in Les Trois-Îlets, Martinique. She lived on the island until she was 15, then moved to Paris in 1779. She caught the eye of a young army officer named Napoleon Bonaparte, and the two were married in 1796. The marriage was annulled in 1810, and Joséphine lived out the rest of her days at a private residence outside of Paris. After she died in 1814, Napoleon commissioned a statue of Joséphine. It was installed in La Savane Park in downtown Fort-de-France, Martinique in 1859. But the statue was not well received. In 1991, a group of people “beheaded” the statue of Josephine in a symbolic execution, and splattered it with red paint. It begged the question; Why is Joséphine so hated? The answer is because of the instrumental role she held in reinstating slavery in the French colonies. France had abolished slavery in 1789, but less than 10 years later when Napoleon and Joséphine took the throne the practice was reinstated. Some believe this was done for the benefit of her family’s plantation in Martinique, which was struggling to stay in business and relied on free labor done by enslaved people. Today, the statue remains headless. Every year, new red paint is added to her statue, so that it never fades.",caribbean empire slavery statues

The island got its name from the way its salt-encrusted surface sparkled in the sunlight, and was the scene of early 19th-century battles between the United Kingdom and France. It was at times occupied by both sides, who considered its occupation as strategic in efforts to blockade the island of Martinique. After capturing the rock during one of these skirmishes, the men under the command of Royal Navy Commodore Sir Samuel Hood, captain of the HMS Centaur, hauled six large cannons to the top. As British naval personnel legally must serve at a commissioned naval station or on a naval vessel, Hood officially commissioned the rock as a naval station. It was given the title HMS Diamond Rock, and it remains so today. If the British Navy ever sails past the rock, they must afford it full honors, with naval personnel required to stand on decks and salute the rock as they pass, despite it sitting on French territory for some time. Officially Martinique is a collectivité territoriale unique, a chartered subdivision of France. Today, most visitors to the rock are scuba divers. The rock, some 175 meters in height and approximately 1,500 meters in circumference. It is considered the final home of a species of the critically endangered Martinique ground snake (Erythrolamprus cursor).

21,AIR Studio Ruins,Montserrat,George Martin's Caribbean recording studio now rots within the shadow of an active volcano.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/air-studio-ruins,"The ruins of Beatles producer George Martin’s Montserrat recording studio now crumble within the shadow of a volatile active volcano that’s been wreaking havoc on the island since the 1990s. Dried mud and ash cake the buildings, and murky rainwater fills the outdoor swimming pool. Wasp nests plug various nooks and hang from the ceiling as tangles of vegetation climb the walls. Forgotten bits of the recording equipment that used to produce so many albums rot inside. You can’t tell by looking at it now, but the grimy complex was once a hot spot for the musical greats of the 1980s. George Martin, the famous English record producer and musician who was sometimes called the “fifth Beatle,” opened AIR Montserrat on the Caribbean island in 1979. It was a branch of Associated Independent Recording (AIR), the recording company he co-founded. Martin’s island oasis studio was soon one of the most prolific recording studios of its era, cranking out a total of 76 albums. Musical legends like the Rolling Stones, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Jimmy Buffett, Paul McCartney, and Michael Jackson recorded within its state-of-the-art walls. Musicians spent days or weeks creating their records at what was then a small sliver of Caribbean paradise. But only a decade after the celebrated studio opened, its life soon came to an abrupt end. When Hurricane Hugo swept across Montserrat in 1989, the storm devastated much of the island and forced the studio to shutter. Then, only six years later, the Soufrière Hills volcano erupted, bombarding the land with lava flows and thick layers of ash. (Jimmy Buffett’s album Volcano, which he recorded in the studio, was named for the then-dormant volcano.) The ongoing volcanic eruptions have made nearly half of the island uninhabitable. The decaying ruins of the studio stand near the fringe of the exclusion zone. Now too fragile to safely walk within, the studio bears little, if any at all, resemblance to its original grandeur.  AIR Studio is fenced-off and aggressively marked with no-trespassing signs. But thankfully, there are many alternatives to experiencing the impressive recording history of the island including 1) viewing the studio from afar from the nearby volcano observatory, 2) visiting the Hilltop Coffee House, a non-profit owned by long-time Montserrat residents that include informative displays on AIR Studio, or 3) visiting Olveston House, the former home of George Martin that's now a hotel and restaurant that includes Beatles photographs.",pop culture music history disaster areas islands ruins
22,Montserrat's City of Ash,"Saint Peter's, Montserrat",A city continually buried under the ash of a volcano that has been erupting for more than 15 years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/montserrat-s-city-of-ash,"As vacationers flew to the Caribbean on a Boeing 737 in 2010 they heard the pilot get on the intercom and calmly announce “Ladies and gentlemen, if you look to the left of the plane, you’ll see a volcano erupting.” The volcano that they saw erupting and hurling a plume of ash into the sky was the Soufriere Hills volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. The volcano has been doing just that, intermittently, for the last 15 years. While we tend to think about volcanos as having short-lasting, devastating eruptions, many are very slow moving, operating on a much more geological time scale. So it is with the Soufriere Hills volcano, which – much to the horror of the island residents – has been taking its sweet time, and been in an active state of eruption since 1995. When the previously quiet volcano began to erupt in 1995, the first eruptions since the 17th century, it sent lava flows and ash falls over the small island of Montserrat. The affected areas were evacuated and no one was killed. However, after people had resettled, the volcano went off again in 1997, this time killing nineteen. The volcano would continue to erupt and would destroy the capital city of Plymouth, the island’s only port, and its only airport as well as cover the entire south side of the 10-mile-long island in a thick layer of ash. (Montserrat has had particularly bad natural-disaster luck, as 90 percent of the island’s buildings had previously been damaged by 1989’s Hurricane Hugo.) With the ongoing eruption the South side of the island was declared uninhabitable and over half of the 12,000 people living on the island before the eruption have never returned since being evacuated. Those that have stayed live on the north side of the island and have rebuilt their port and airport. The volcano is being closely studied by the Montserrat Volcano Observatory. Scientists believe that the volcano is made up of two large magma chambers stacked on top of each other, which may be causing the extended eruption. The people of Montserrat live in the shadow of a continually active volcano, but despite the hardships that can bring, they persevere, developing the culture and economy of their beautiful island home with the cheerful determination they are famous for. Within the last year, lava flows came down the south side of mountain and reached the sea, while part of the lava dome collapsed sending a plume of ash 20,000 feet into the air.

23,Runaway Ghaut,"Woodlands, Montserrat",Legend says those who drink from this trickle of water are destined to return to Montserrat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/runaway-ghaut,"Maps as old as 1673 illustrate just how littered with ghauts the tiny, mountainous Caribbean island of Montserrat is. But Runaway Ghaut, which bisects the town of Olveston, is one of only four ghauts in Montserrat with a permanent flow of rainwater. Local legend claims that those who drink right from the ghaut are destined to return to Montserrat, should they ever leave the island. A ghaut (pronounced “gut’”) is an usual geological feature that’s quite common on the islands of the Lesser Antilles. These narrow but deep gullies run along the steepest slopes of the islands’ mountains, funneling rainwater into the larger bodies of water at the lower elevations. Because of the permanence of their runs and the reliability of their flows, ghauts play an instrumental role in maintaining the lush forest ecosystems of these small islands and have historically played an equally important role as a source for clean drinking water for the island’s human populations. And while most ghauts only run seasonally, due to their entirely weather-dependent source, there are a noted few across the Caribbean that maintain a constant trickle year round. Runaway Ghaut received both its peculiar name and its famous legend after French forces fled the island from the Olveston area following their defeat by the British, only to return years later and briefly reclaim control of Montserrat. But this lackluster landmark’s legend has only recently taken on an even greater significance in light of the island’s recent history. On July 18, 1995, the long-dormant volcano in the south of Montserrat, Soufrière Hill, began to spew ash and trigger mud slides. More than 11,000 people were evacuated from the island’s most populous area surrounding the capital city and were forcibly relocated. A lucky few resettled in the more geologically stable north of the island, but most of the evacuated Montserratians made their way to the United Kingdom as refugees via ferries from the north of Montserrat (as Soufrière had destroyed the island’s only airport). The only safely passable road to the north ran through Olveston and directly past the famous Runaway Ghaut, which became an important stop for those being displaced. Today, Runaway Ghaut continues to trickle rainwater down from the Centre Hills year-round, and is clearly marked along Salem Road, which runs from the new capital of Brades (Little Bay) south to Salem and the boundary of the “exclusion zone” (as Soufrière remains geologically unstable). Travelers who enjoy their time on this underappreciated Caribbean island are encouraged to stop here and drink from the ghaut to guarantee their own return.  Due to the sensitivity of Montserrat’s endangered ecosystem, it is not recommended that travelers shimmy their way through the brush to drink from Runaway Ghaut. Instead the citizens of Olveston have constructed a stone fountain so that anyone may drink from its fabled flowing waters. However, this fountain rests along one of the islands major roads, right before a blind curve, and does not have a designated parking space. So travelers should be alert for on-coming traffic and conscious of where they park should they arrive by car. These precautions are equally important to ensuring your return to the island.",rites and rituals legends geological oddities islands water geology
24,Gros Piton,"Soufriere, Saint Lucia",The larger of two volcanic peaks rising out of the crystalline waters of the Caribbean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gros-piton-saint-lucia,"Soaring 2,500 feet from the clear blue waters of the Caribbean, two towering peaks dominate the skyline. The larger of these green-laden summits is known as Gros Piton and its smaller counterpart is Petit Piton. They border Soufrière, a colorful Saint Lucia town that once served as the country’s capital. The Pitons are volcanic plugs that were created when lava cooled within a vent of the currently-dormant volcanoes. The Pitons of Saint Lucia are among the largest of the world’s volcanic plugs. In 2004, the Pitons were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Vibrant coral reefs cover nearly 60 percent of the surrounding marine area, which is home to 168 different species of finfish. The tropical forests that cover the Pitons are also a refuge for a range of unique flora and fauna. Gros Piton is home to 148 plant species and the Petit Piton is home to 97. On the small ridge between the two plugs, eight rare tree species have also been found. The forests lining the Pitons are teeming with almost 30 different bird species, five of which are endemic, as well as rodents, opossums, bats, reptiles, and amphibians. The Pitons have become an iconic image for the island nation. So much so, the Saint Lucia-based Windward and Leeward Brewery named a beer after them. Their award-winning Piton beer was first brewed in October 1992 and includes many varieties like Piton Shandy Lemon or Piton Shandy Ginger. The popular beer can be found throughout the Caribbean and beyond.  The Gros Piton trailhead can be found at the following address: Gros piton soufriere, Soufriere, St. Lucia. The almost three-mile, out-and-back hike climbs 1,814 feet and takes about 3-6 hours to complete each way. Visitors can also hike the one-mile, out-and-back trail to the top of Petit Piton. This hike takes usually around an hour and 15 minutes to complete with an elevation gain of 1,250 feet. Both trails are open year-round, but the Gros Piton trail is better marked and more well-traveled. Visitors shouldn’t hike the Petit Piton trail when it’s rainy, and special permits and guides may be required to hike the smaller Piton.",unesco volcanoes mountains parks natural wonders nature
25,Sulphur Springs,"Soufriere, Saint Lucia",Come for the springs; stay for the mud bath.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sulphur-springs-saint-lucia,"Located at what’s billed as “the only drive-in volcano in the world,” Sulphur Springs is a magical, muddy geothermal spring located near the small Caribbean town of Soufriere. The town’s name means “sulphur mine,” a product of French colonists who extracted the mineral at a site near Soufriere in the early 1800s. The Sulphur Springs are located within a volcanic valley. They formed approximately 300,000 years ago when a section of crust from an enormous crater collapsed, disturbing the lava below. The change in landscape ultimately resulted in the formation of the hot springs. But, since a minor eruption in 1776, the volcano heating the springs has been lying dormant. The last major eruption was some 40,000 years ago. A visit to the Sulphur Springs begins with looking at whistling fumaroles and boiling pools from the safety of observation platforms. The water in the springs ranges from around 145-200 degrees Fahrenheit (63-96ºC), but some openings called fumaroles can reach 340 degrees Fahrenheit (171ºC). As the steam rises to the surface it carries hydrogen sulfide along with it, which gives the area a pungent rotten egg-like odor. After taking in the sights and smells, it’s time to submerge yourself in the mud baths. The tour company that maintains the spring recommends wearing a dark bathing suit so you can properly slather yourself with their “miracle mud.” The company’s website proclaims their mud can make you “look 12 years younger” and “detoxifies the body and helps heal sunburns, eczema, arthritis, sore joints, and more.” (Results undoubtedly vary.) After covering yourself in mud, it’s time to hit the waterfalls to wash off. The 50-foot tall waterfall can even be used as “an invigorating back and shoulder massage” on drier days. The mud baths are a popular destination for visitors to Saint Lucia, and have even been featured on ABC’s The Bachelor. Unfortunately, the spring’s miracle mud wasn’t quite strong enough to help that season’s bachelor, Juan Pablo Galavis, find love. But, worry not, the Sulphur Springs tour company still offers a 10-hour “honeymoon tour” for any lovebirds looking to get a little muddy.

The “pond” itself was formed when lava from the erupting Soufriere volcano met the sea and rapidly cooled, forming a small bowl at the water’s edge. Waves regularly break over the lava rock that forms the edge of the bowl, keeping the water level of this natural swimming pool high. The lava rock that surrounds the salt pond has been eroded into fantastic shapes by the waves. The entire experience is like swimming in a crystal-clear tropical pool, surrounded by an abstract sculpture garden. There are small cliffs to jump off and deep spots to dive into. Occasionally, fish (and even jellyfish) are washed into the pool by incoming waves. The government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines has plans to develop the Owia Salt pond as a tourist site, but for now the only development is a staircase leading down to the coast from a small parking lot on a cliff high above.

Conch shells, while almost universally prized as kitschy decoration, are often simply the byproduct of fishermen who scoop out the muscle inside and leave the elaborate shells as waste. This actually became a problem along the beaches of Union Island which was becoming increasingly littered with the shells in the early 2000’s. Seeing the issue, Janti (an oral version of the french name “Gentil”, which means nice or kind) while working as a volunteer environmental officer devised a unique solution to the natural pollution. Beginning in 2002, Janti began gathering up conches and similarly-sized rocks on a shallow part of a nearby reef, eventually creating his own private retreat, dubbing it, “Happy Island.” Creating a flat concrete surface to his new islet, Janti built small bar and patio area that encompasses the entirety of the surface and imported some palm trees from another nearby island. Today Janti operates a friendly bar for every sailor and tourist who wants to charter a small boat out to the happy little getaway where Janti now lives with his partner. The hours are flexible (island time) and calling ahead is necessary, but there are few more laid back places in all of Saint Vincent and The Grenadines. Step up your game, Parrotheads.",bars islands
28,Mopion,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,"Looking like nothing more than a cartoon deserted island, this tiny sandbar is home only to a single umbrella.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mopion,"Supposedly the smallest island in the Caribbean, Mopion is more of a cay (a low inlet mainly composed of coral or sand) and its size depends on the tides. But its iconic umbrella is never quite submerged. The very first name of the island seems to have been Morpion, with an R, “morpion” being the French word for “pubic louse.” But over time it appears the R has been removed according to more common Caribbean speech patterns. Mopion is part of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines island chain and is considered by many to be a sort of geographical mascot for the whole area. It’s easy to see why. A pure sandy beach surrounded by a lovely underwater reef, Mopion is a quiet gem in the middle of turquoise waters. At just 100 feet (30 meters) long or so (depending on the tides), the small sandbar is so low that a thatch umbrella was built on it for the sailors to spot from a distance to avoid dashing their vessels on the reef. The straw parasol is also the only protection against the sun for anyone marooned, intentionally or otherwise on the idyllic little piece of land. Visitors are also known to leave their mark carved into the trunk of the umbrella.  Reachable by boat (your own, or a water-taxi hired on any surrounding island). Though the small stretch of sand is a pretty dreamy little beach for those that can reach it, there is another sandbar in eyeshot that is unvisited, and for that matter unnamed, as it is said to be where all of the local tourist restaurants in the area dump their garbage, resulting in a large amount of sharks in the surrounding waters, although this unconfirmed.",caribbean beaches islands
29,Moonhole Homes,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,These eclectic homes nestled into the cliffs of a Caribbean island were built entirely from scavenged materials.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moonhole,"Named for the extraordinary stone arch that stretches over the first home built in the community, Moonhole is an eclectic collection of homes designed to blend with nature. New Yorkers Thomas and Gladys Johnston began building their tropical home on the island of Bequia in the 1960s from found materials and locally scavenged resources, including a bar made from a humpback whale’s jawbone. The community is now a 19-home enclave on the island’s southern tip. The homes are not only made of scavenged materials, but are designed to be ecologically friendly, running on solar power.",eccentric homes homes
30,Petit Nevis Whaling Station,"La Pompe, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines",This century old flensing port is a remnant of a culture for whom whaling is still legal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/petit-nevis-whaling-station,"The people of Bequia island are one of the three populations in the world for whom whale hunting is tolerated by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). As is true for the Inuit people, whale hunting in Bequia is both a constitutive tradition and a survival need as there are no other natural resources on the island. However this tolerance comes with very specific conditions, mainly that whale hunting is to remain a traditional and non-commercial activity. Thus no motorboats are allowed to hunt the whales, which is a boon to local tourism as the long and elegant wooden sailboats used for catching them are one of the interesting things to see in Bequia. In addition, only handheld harpoons can be used, no other weapons are permitted, certainly no firearms. Finally, absolutely no product from the caught whales (meat, oil, bones, etc.) may be exported, and only four whales a year are allowed to be killed. When a whale is caught, it is dragged ashore to be butchered into pieces. Since this activity has to be done in a controlled place it does not happen on the main island. Since the very first days of whale hunting in Bequia (which started soon after the end of slavery there) a whaling facility had been set up on the small nearby island of Petit Nevis. This facility ran for almost 150 years. However, some years ago, the owners of Petite Nevis Island, a former and famous whale-hunting old family itself, decided they did not want to be associated with whale killing anymore and asked for the facility to be moved. Now, a brand new facility has been built on Semplers Cay, an even tinier island closer to the coast of Bequia (you can easily spot it and see the new facility from the village of La Pompe, Bequia). Despite its abandonment, there are still remains of the buildings, the ovens used to heat the “coppers,” and the ramp on which the whales were dragged ashore is also still visible. Thanks to the strict but permissable restrictions, whale hunting in Bequia remains a tradition and never evolves into an industrial activity. Moreover, even this limited hunt is slowing down and slowly disappearing now that the commercial routes with the other islands nearby are more regular. During the 2013-2014 season, no whales at all were killed in Bequia.  To go to Petit Nevis Island, you need to ask permission of the owners and then hire a water-taxi. The easiest way to do so is from the villages of La Pompe or Paget Farm (Bequia). The crossing takes only ten minutes from Bequia. Walking around the island takes two hours max. So you can make a deal with the pilot for him to wait for you there and then take you back. A decent price for this would be EC$ 120 for two persons.",whales abandoned ruins animals
31,Pitch Lake,"New Jersey, Trinidad and Tobago",This peculiar lake of pitch is so thick and viscous that one can walk on its surface.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pitch-lake,"Sometimes, it feels soft and spongy, like the top of a gigantic eraser. At other points, it’s more like quicksand. And dotted throughout are breaks in its continuity, revealing water below – not unlike a lake frozen for winter. It’s the surface of Pitch Lake, which is exactly what it sounds like: A lake “made of” pitch. And in most places, it’s nearly solid, allowing fascinated visitors to walk along its strange, often unsettling surface. A more accurate description is that Pitch Lake is a basin in the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago that collects both water and pitch, resulting in a somewhat unreal mixture of the two, at times as thin as regular lakewater, and at others as hard as a rock. Debris such as boulders, fallen trees, and refuse often get caught in the sticky surface, resulting in impromptu works of art as well as warning signs of the lake’s actual danger, as the pitch hardens around the object and effectively turns it to stone. The first European to document Pitch Lake was Sir Walter Raleigh, who encountered it on his search for El Dorado. Raleigh was pleased with the quality of the pitch, describing it as “most excellent good…it melteth not with the sun as the pitch of Norway.” Raleigh’s expedition ended in infamous failure, but not before he took note of Pitch Lake’s ecology: “all of ston pitch or bitumen which riseth out of the ground in little springs or fountaynes and so running a little way, it hardneth in the aire, and coverith all the playne; there are also many springs of water and in and among them fresh water fishe’.” This doesn’t stop daring travelers from walking along the surface of the lake, jabbing sticks and rocks into the clingy goo that forms the more stable areas, or even taking a plunge in the open “pools” of water that often form at crevices in the semi-continuous pitch. Long known by locals to be a strange place, Pitch Lake has picked up a bit of a reputation as a tourist attraction, with off-the-beaten-path travelers coming to examine one of the strangest lakes on the planet.",martian landscapes natural history intriguing environs geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems water geology nature
32,Abandoned Radar Base in Trinidad,Trinidad and Tobago,This giant Cold War satellite dish has become a symbol of Trinidad's need for sovereignty.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-radar-base-in-trinidad,"In the 1960’s, during the Cold War, the USA deployed inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in the Western Hemisphere to prevent any Russian attacks. It was during this tense time that the US also developed the Early Warning System to get a jump on any imminent missile attacks before they were able to reach American soil. The radar station built in Trinidad near Chaguaramas was one of the first stations built in the monitoring network. The installation was finished in 1958, and the site had been chosen since the area had already been leased by the British to the USA since the early 1940’s to construct a naval base. The Chaguaramas radar station operated until 1971, but as it had been built without warning the local authorities, the abandoned remains continued to be important as a symbol of the Trinidadian fight for sovereignty. Today the empty structures on the site retain a gloomy movie-like atmosphere when the day is misty, but it makes a great place for star gazing when the night is clear. Despite its scientific, historic, and social relevance to the area there are rumblings that the site will be demolished to make room for hotel space. Unfortunately there is no early warning system to defend against the inexorable roll of commercial development.

33,Piparo Mud Volcano,Trinidad and Tobago,The site of a devastating modern-day mud volcano eruption that buried parts of a village.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/piparo-mud-volcano,"Piparo is a village in Trinidad On the southern edge of Trinidad’s Central Range lies the small village of Piparo, which boasts a few claims to fame: first, it was where calypso legend Ras Shorty chose to retire; second, it had been the base of operations for notorious drug lord Dole Chadee until his 1999 execution; lastly, and of utmost import, the village of Piparo was the site of a bizarre, hugely destructive mud volcano eruption that took place on February 22, 1997. Thanks to tremors and rumbling that gave precious little warning of the devastating eruption to come, villagers were able to flee at the last minute before magmatic mud flooded their homes from floor to ceiling. Cars and homes were buried under a square mile of mud that quickly hardened into a concrete-like clay. Though no one was killed, 31 families were permanently displaced from their homes. Since that fateful day, an alternate route to Piparo was established through nearby Guaracara, and the original mud volcano now lies inactive at the site of the 1997 eruption. The remnants of destroyed houses, roads to nowhere, and general mayhem are still visible to this day. Piparo’s mud volcano eruption is no isolated case in Trinidad. Though much more rare than their appearance on land, mud volcanoes also formed temporary islands off Trinidad in 1964 and 2001. Moreover, approximately 15 other mud volcanoes also exist in the area, making a tour of these fascinating and rare geological formations a great reminder of the weird ways nature continues to unexpectedly reassert mastery over her tenants.",mud volcanoes volcanoes geological oddities geology

One of the old mysteries of Plymouth is the tomb of Betty Stiven, who died in the 18th century. On her tomb is inscribed the strange epitaph: Beneath these walls are deposited the body of Mrs. Betty Stiven and her child. She was the beloved wife of Alex B Stiven. To the end of his days will deplore her death, which happened upon the 25th November 1783 in the 23rd year of her age. What was remarkable of her, she was a mother without knowing it, and a wife without letting her husband know it except by her kind indulgence to him. Locals have many theories about what transpired between the husband and wife, most of which involve the concealment of a sexual relationship with a Black woman that he enslaved. Some of the stories, though, are too big to believe: that Betty gave birth to four children while unconscious, whose existence was then concealed from her. Also, the story relies on the idea that once a man takes a woman’s virginity, he becomes her husband, even without a ceremony. Another contradictory story claims Betty fell in love with a man and got him drunk enough to marry her without his consent, but proceeded to indulge his every whim. After getting pregnant, she got sick and gave birth in an unconscious state. While none of these theories have ever been validated, there continues to be much hypothesizing.

Alternately, may take first left on Claude Noel highway towards Grafton and follow the road along the coast to Plymouth. Tobago is extremely small and has excellent signage to guide the adventurous.

35,Iguana Island,"Leeward Settlement, Turks and Caicos Islands",Uninhabited islet in the Caribbean is the sanctuary of giant lizards.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iguana-island,"A small island less than a mile long just off the coast of Providenciales in Turks and Caicos is home to a booming population of the endangered Turks & Caicos Rock Iguana (Cyclura carinata). Little Water Cay, sometimes called Iguana Island, is accessable only by boat or kayak. On the inhabited islands in the Turks chain, introduction of domestic cats and dogs wiped out native iguana populations, but due to conservation efforts Iguana island and numerous other small islets and cays have the large lizards in abundance. These friendly reptiles eat mostly fruit and leaves, including the local guava plants and occasional insects, the female iguanas will often climb trees to reach ripe berries. The iguanas help disperse seeds with their foraging and are thus an important part of the ecosystem on the islands. They are very territorial, and as there are more male iguanas than female, they often square off for the opportunity to mate. Males can be identified by the dinosaur-like spikes running down their spines, while females have noticable rings around the length of their tails. Local ecotours will take you to the island, part of the cost of your trip going to its conservation. It’s certainly worth it to walk along the paths and boardwalks of the island and see the iguanas who are not skittish or even phased by your presence, and many of whom are known by name to the island guides.

Today, the La Famille Express rests on a reef in a few feet of water, abandoned and desolate. It was built in 1952 by the Russian Navy as a cargo ship, the Fort Shevchenko. It was sold to an islander in the mid-1990s, but not before witnessing the Cuban Missile Crisis first-hand in 1962. Alone on the reef, rusting and decaying since the day it was wrecked, it serves as a visual landmark for boaters and a hidden attraction of the Turks and Caicos Islands.

You’re going to have some time to kill while awaiting salvation from a passing ship or rescue party, why not mark your visit on one of the rocks. That’s just what countless sailors and shipwreck victims did when they found themselves on Sapodilla Hill on the island of Providenciales in the Northwestern Caicos Islands. Etched into the craggy chalk rocks and boulders strewn across the hill are names, dates, and small designs left by unlucky sailors that found themselves marooned on the island, heading to the hill for a better vantage point from which to spot ships. Some of the rocks were left with just a crude name and date carved into the stone, while others featured little boats or buildings to tell their tales. Most of the carvings were left between the mid-1700s to the mid-1800s. Now that getting marooned on a deserted island isn’t much of a problem (at least not in the Caicos), no new rock etchings are being made on Sapodilla Hill. In fact, the ones that remain have dwindled since their heyday. Due to destruction and theft, the historic markers have slowly been disappearing over the years. Luckily, today the site is a protected historical site which is slowly being catalogued and preserved by the Turks and Caicos Museum. In addition to taking impressions of many of the carvings, the museum has relocated a number of the carved rocks to protect them. They are also researching the names and stories behind each carving to better understand the history of wrecks that left their mark on the island.",sailors shipwrecks rocks geology

The Hole is about 50 feet across and 60 feet down to the water in the bottom. It is possible that it’s connected to the ocean, as it appears to be tidal. Locals say when it rains enough, you can jump into the hole as the water is deep enough. There is small opening a few yards away that leads into the hole as well—this is apparently how you get back out once you’ve jumped in. The sinkholes are caused by slightly acidic rain slowly eating away the limestone (the Karst process). The stone around the hole is soft and crumbly, and there are no guardrails, so tread carefully. Turn off the Long Bay Highway onto Sea Sage Hill Road, there will be a sign on a telephone pole that says ""The Hole""",sinkhole water
