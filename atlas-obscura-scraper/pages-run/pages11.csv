0,Afghanistan's Blue Mosque,"Mazari Sharif, Afghanistan",This magnificent blue mosque in Afghanistan is surrounded by thousands of white doves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-mosque-afghanistan,"The Blue Mosque has been described as an oasis for peace, and it really does seem like it, considering the thousands of white doves surrounding the mosque. The doves flock on the trees, the roof, and the sidewalks. Legend has it the mosque is so sacred that any dove with a speck of color on its feathers will instantly become pure white after entering the mosque’s vicinity. According to legend, a Middle Eastern mullah (scholar of Islam) had a dream that Ali bin Abi Talib, the son-in-law and cousin of the prophet Muhammad, had his bones resting in what is now northwestern Afghanistan. Captivated by his story, Ahmad Sanjar, who was the Sultan of the Seljuq Empire from 1118 to 1157, constructed the Shrine of Ali in northwestern Afghanistan. He even constructed a city around the shrine, called Mazar-i-Sharif, to which thousands of religious Muslims migrated. Unfortunately, a century after the shrine was built, Genghis Khan made his westward push. When he reached Mazar-i-Sharif, Khan completely destroyed the shrine. But it wasn’t gone for long. In 1481, Sultan Husayn Mizra rebuilt the Shrine of Ali in an even grander fashion, in the form of a giant blue mosque which still exists to this day. When you look at it, the structure appears to be floating, a trick of Islamic architecture, which uses intricately painted clay tiles. The tiles constantly need to be replaced — two square feet every day — from exposure to the natural elements and because the corners of certain tiles are often stolen by pilgrims as religious mementos. The Blue Mosque offers a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of Mazar-i-Sharif’s streets and bazaars. It is consistently quiet, except for when the muezzin makes one of the daily calls for prayer.",
1,Site of the Bamiyan Buddhas,"Bamyan, Afghanistan","Once an impressive link to Afghanistan’s Buddhist past, now a sad reminder of intolerance towards other cultures.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/site-bamiyan-buddhas,"Few man-made destructions of cultural heritage have been blatant as the bombing of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban in 2001. Prior to the destruction, the Giant Buddhas had already been worn down from decades of war and neglect, but it only took a few minutes to wipe out the remnants of Afghanistan’s most majestic pre-Islamic site. Since their creation in the 6th century, the Bamiyan Buddhas have been the largest Buddha statues west of China, and rose majestically out of the otherwise featureless plains of Central Afghanistan. There were two main statues, 53 and 35 meters high respectively, that portrayed a Vairocana Buddha and a Shakyamuni Buddha. A number of smaller Buddha statues adorned the surrounding area. Surrounding the statues were also several undecorated monastic cells, which had been, just as the Giant Buddhas, hewn into the cliffs. Immediately after the hottest stage of the war against the Taliban in 2002, first steps of reconstructing the Buddhas were made, and the entire area has been thoroughly researched, tagged and mapped for the reconstruction. During this process a number of brightly painted Buddhist caves were rediscovered. In 2008, a previously unknown 19 meter long statue of a Reclining Buddha was uncovered during the search for a semi-mythological 300 meter long Reclining Giant Buddha that is reputedly hidden in the region. The 300 meter long Buddha was mentioned by a Chinese monk in the 7th century, and given his detailed description of the two standing Buddhas, historians did not entirely dismiss his remarks on the third. If this statue truly existed and was rediscovered, it would be by far the largest Buddha statue in the world. When the Taliban decided to destroy the Buddhas, it caused an outcry from the international community. Several countries tried to prevent the Taliban from destroying the Buddhas by various offerings, such as buying the statues and relocating them to another country. But since the Taliban were not willing to consider these propositions, the world had to helplessly witness the bombardment of the ancient colossals. Given the worsening of the security situation in the country within the last few years, it does not seem likely that the Giant Buddhas are to be rebuilt anytime soon. Even UNESCO shattered hopes that the reconstruction of the once world-famous World Heritage Site would take place in the near future, stating that it would likely be a long-term project. Thus, the bare rock niches, which once held the Giant Buddhas, will for now continue to serve as a stark reminder of the ignorance toward other cultures and the loss of an important survivor of Afghanistan’s pre-Islamic history.",
2,Stupa of Takht-e Rostam,"Aybak, Afghanistan",Highly unusual subterranean stupa and adjacent cave monastery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stupa-takhte-rostam,"There are places in the world so strongly devoted to a particular religion that it is incredibly hard to believe that they have been shaped by any other faith. Afghanistan is one of those places, a country so devoutly Islamic that it seems that Islam has been around since the beginning of time - However before the advent of Islam, Afghanistan was an important center of Buddhist teaching. To find remnants of this Buddhist past, one has to search extremely thoroughly. The once rich excavation sites have turned to rubble after decades of war and neglect, the museum collections have been looted or irreparably damaged, and the Bamiyan Buddhas – once the country’s strongest reminder of its Buddhist past – were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. Since the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas, the Stupa of Takht-e Rostam in Samangan Province is arguably Afghanistan’s most impressive pre-Islamic site. Unlike other stupas, the one of Takht-e Rostam has not been mounted above ground, but it has been carved into the ground, in a style that resembles the monolithic churches of Ethiopia. At the top of the stupa is a stone-carved Harmika building, which once held relics of the Buddha. The trench surrounding the stupa is around eight meters deep. A path leads down to the bottom of the trench, where Buddhist monks once clockwise circumnavigated the stupa. Carved inside the outer walls of the trench is a Buddhist monastery with five individual caves and several monastic cells for meditation. Small holes in the roofs allow a little daylight to enter the caves, creating a peaceful atmosphere of twilight. The cave monastery is lacking any decorative elements, but is impressive for its sheer engineering feat. Historians have proposed two possible reasons, as to why the stupa has been carved in the ground, instead of being built above ground. One explanation is that it could have been done for the purpose of camouflage to protect the monastery from invaders. Another much more mundane explanation states that it has simply been done to escape the excessive climate extremes of Afghanistan. The Afghan name Takht-e Rostam (Throne of Rostam) refers to a legendary figure in Persian culture. After the Islamization of Afghanistan, when the knowledge of the original purpose of the stupa became lost, the site became known as the place where Rostam supposedly married his bride Tahmina. The ruins are located up the hill 3 km southwest above the town of Samangan.",
3,Band-e Amir Lakes,"Yakawlang, Afghanistan",Splashes of blue in an otherwise monotonous lunar landscape.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/band-e-amir-lakes,"The lakes of Band-e Amir are an incredibly stunning sight. Six deep blue lakes suddenly appear like sparkling jewels in the middle of the barren grey wasteland of Central Afghanistan that stretches as far the eye can see. The lakes’ waters are composed of a high mineral content, which is responsible for the deep blue colour of the lakes. Travertine walls between and around the lakes have created natural dams, that store the rainwater, which flows from the cracks and fissures of the surrounding rocks. Around the shore of the lake Band-e Haibat the travertine walls reach a height of twelve meters, creating an otherworldy effect of some sort of natural infinity pool. The overspilling water of the lake creates small waterfalls along the outer rim of the travertine walls. According to local legend, the lakes were formed as the result of a series of miracles performed by Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed, which left the local king so amazed that he immediately decided to convert to Islam. A shrine to Ali to honour his miraculous works stands on the shore of one of the lakes. If one day the tourism industry in Afghanistan gets going, the Band-e Amir lakes are likely to become the country’s prime tourist attraction. Even today, the lakes are a favorite destination for day trips, and they exude an often joyful and almost festive atmosphere – a rarity in Afghanistan, which makes the lakes popular among locals and expats alike. This atmosphere at the lakes is a unique reminder of the days when Afghanistan was firmly placed on the tourist map, as the country was part of the famous Hippie Trail from Istanbul to Northern India. In 2009, the country’s first national park was created around the vicinity of the lakes. While still open to visitors, there is harsh terrain, mined unpaved roads, and no real basic facilities. Only a thin track of road is safe to travel on, so adventure wisely.",
4,Herat National Museum,"Herat, Afghanistan","Despite a history of destruction, this former citadel survives to document Afghanistan's oft overlooked history.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/herat-national-museum,"No one knows Herat’s exact age, but it was most likely founded as an outpost of the Achaemenid Empire (550-330BC) and named Aria. Alexander the Great’s army overran the Persians, and changed the name to Alexandria-of-the-Arians. On a strategic hill in the center of town sits the restored ruins of Qala Iktyaruddin (Persian: قلعه اختیارالدین‎): the Citadel of Herat (Persian: ارگ هرات‎, Pashto: سکندرۍ کلا). In 330 BCE it was also known as the Citadel of Alexander, and it is quite likely the oldest building in the city. It was destroyed by Genghis Khan’s Mongol army in 1221 CE, and then rebuilt in its present form by the Kart Governor Malik Fakhruddin in 1305 CE, only to be destroyed again by Tamerlane in 1380 CE. Tamerlane’s son, Shah Rukh, used 7,000 men to embellish the walls and repair the damage wrought by his father. It then became the heart of the Timurid Empire (1405-1506). In more recent times it has served as a military garrison and prison for various dynasties and regimes and was thus closed to visitors from the outside world until 2005 when the Afghan Army presented it to the Ministry of Information, Culture, and Tourism. Between 2006 and 2011 the Aga Khan Trust, with grants from the USA and Germany, completely restored the structure. The National Museum of Herat is housed in the lower Citadel. The Museum of Islamic Art in Berlin worked with the German Archaeological Institute to document and restore artifacts and prepare them for display. The museum was opened to the public in October of 2011. There are about 1,100 items from the Herat region in the museum, of which there are about 250 on display. Most are from the 10th to 13th centuries when Herat was at the height of its political and cultural significance. There is pottery, metal work, the tombstone of Behzad, the famous painter of Persian miniatures, old manuscripts and books and a cenotaph adorned with tiles that date from 1378. The collection includes old muskets and cannon, and very curious three-dimensional replicas of some of Behzad’s most famous miniatures. The museum has long, well-lit, archways and arcades of brown brick. Though smaller than the Kabul Museum, the setting feels more architecturally unique, and it is in keeping with the restoration of the Citadel as a whole. Even though Herat is one of the safest cities in Afghanistan, it is still probably not advisable for the average Central Asian tourist to include it on their itinerary. Only those already well experienced with the delicate intricacies of Afghan travel should even attempt a visit until the tourism infrastructure has been somewhat restored.",The Citadel of Herat sits on a quite visible hill within the walls of the old city.
5,OMAR Mine Museum,"Kabul, Afghanistan",A sobering museum dedicated to landmines and the personnel working to remove them from Afghanistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/omar-mine-museum,"The OMAR Mine Museum in Kabul displays 51 of the 53 types of landmines used in Afghanistan. It also houses a variety of other military hardware from wars fought in the country in recent decades. Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Most of the mines’ victims are innocent civilians. Tragically, the buried weapons claim the lives of far too many curious children. The Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation (OMAR) was formed in 1990 to help combat the issue. Its team of about 500 people performs the rather stressful job of removing landmines from the earth within Afghanistan. A plain white brick building in Kabul houses their findings. Besides landmines, the museum also holds cluster bombs, rockets, unexploded ordnance, and airdrop bombs. There are even Russian “butterfly” mines, which children often mistook for plastic toys because they were made in a wide range of vibrant colors. The grounds surrounding the museum contain an interesting collection of rockets, surface-to air-missiles, and aircraft including helicopter gunships and an MiG fighter. If the museum isn’t a sobering enough experience, a memorial plaque inside honors the bravery of those who’ve died removing landmines in the area.",Due to security reasons you cannot visit this museum without an appointment but this can be arranged through the main OMAR office in Kabul. There is a hefty charge of around $20 for photography but presumably it helps toward landmine clearance.
6,Darul Aman Palace,"Kabul, Afghanistan",What was once supposed to be the symbol of a shining Afghan future is now a bombed-out ruin.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/darul-aman-palace,"Darul Aman, “the dwelling-place of peace,” sits in ruins outside Kabul, Afghanistan, a crumbling symbol of what was once supposed to be the modern future of the country. Amanullah Khan, ruler of Afghanistan between 1919 and 1929, ordered the construction of the impressive structure, intending the palace to be the centerpiece of a new capital city in the country.  The city was to be a gleaming, European-style settlement, rising up from the plains with the palace as the crown jewel. Needless to say, the city was never built and the palace never came into its own. The conservative rulers who deposed Amanullah Khan scorned his plans and his reforms, leaving Darul Aman to rot. Set on fire in the 1970’s, shelled by mujahideen in the 1990’s, and targeted by the Taliban in 2012, the palace, once a symbol of optimism and change, was repeatedly brutalized. Still standing today, Darul Aman is now a crumbling ruin. A plan to restore it has so far come to nothing but its walls still contain the last century of Afghan history: the grandeur of its ambitions, the depth of its bloodshed and violence, an ultimately a monument to the improbable resilience of hope.",
7,Chilzina and the Forty Steps of Kandahar,"Kandahar, Afghanistan","Rock-cut chamber at top of an outcroup, reached by a mountain stairway of forty steps.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/forty-steps-kandahar-chilzina,"Sometimes, simplicity speaks volumes. A short tower can seem imposing on a featureless plain. A tiny word can say a lot if it’s on a blank wall. And 40 simple steps can tell a complex story of perseverance and dominance, if they’re carved into the mountainside leading to its peak. That’s the scene at Chilzina, otherwise known as the “Forty Steps of Kandahar.” Carved into a mountain peak at the western boundary of what was “Old Kandahar” (conveniently located in the same place as the current Kandahar), this monument was an imposing symbol etched upon the natural defense formed by Kandahar’s western mountains. And the man who put them there knew exactly what he was doing. Babur was the first emperor of the Mughal Empire, and he did not come by that title lightly. He literally bent the world before him to his will, conquering much of central Asia and the Indian subcontinent to form his empire and expand the influence of his Persian culture. A descendant of both Timur and Ghenghis Khan, Babur wanted people to know his name as well. Thus at Chilzina, he carved a staircase into a mountain and hollowed out an enclave for recording his history. Into the wall of that enclave, Babur carved the story of his conquests in the Mughal Empire in Persian for all to see. He then carved statues of two lions, chained, at the top of the stairs, guarding the entrance to the enclave. While the staircase is impressive indeed and the inscription is the point of it all, the lions remain the best example of his legacy. Because they were chained, even these guardians, shaped purposefully and painstakingly out of bare stone, signified his power and control over them, there at his service, just as he saw the world around him.",
8,Marjan the Lion Memorial,"Kabul, Afghanistan",This monument honors the life of a long-suffering lion whose story captivated the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marjan-the-lion-memorial,"Before the mid-1990s civil war in Afghanistan, the Kabul Zoo housed many exotic animals. Unfortunately, most were killed or escaped during the fighting. But some remained in captivity, in dire conditions, throughout the surrounding conflicts. The zoo’s most celebrated former resident was Marjan the lion (“marjan” means “coral” in Persian). There are multiple claims about his age—some say he was born in the ‘60s, other reports claim the ‘70s. The Cologne Zoo donated him to the Kabul Zoo, the kingdom he shared for the majority of his life with a lioness named Chucha. Marjan’s story is not a happy one. In 1995, a man (some say a guerilla soldier) either attempting to prove his bravery or for a bet, climbed into Marjan’s enclosure. Although Chucha permitted the man to stroke her, Marjan was not so tolerant of the intrusion and pounced upon the man, subsequently mauling him to death. The following day, the brother of the dead man exacted his revenge by throwing hand grenades at Marjan, who instinctively jumped on one of them. The resulting blast left the lion lame, blind, deaf, and with half his teeth blown out. Despite his injuries, the cat survived and lived for another seven years—unlike the grenade-thrower, who was attacked and killed for his actions a week later. Marjan’s story captivated animal lovers around the world. Even as the warfare drove most people from Kabul and brought peril to every day within the city, dedicated caretakers did all they could to ensure the lion remained fed and comfortable until he died of old age in 2002. Marjan is buried in Kabul Zoo, where a bronze memorial statue of him has been placed at the entrance. The lion has come to symbolize Afghanistan’s survival throughout its decades of hardships. An inscription on the memorial reads “Here lies Marjan, who was about 23. He was the most famous lion in the world.”",
9,Minaret of Jam,"Shahrak, Afghanistan",200-foot-high minaret and only remnant of Afghanistan's lost city of the Turquoise Mountain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lonely-minarete-of-jam,"For the last three decades, almost constant conflict has colored the world’s perceptions of Afghanistan, and an inhospitable climate and frightening political instability have left Afghanistan on few traveler’s itineraries. But before the war-torn reality of the country today, societies flourished, and left behind traces of their greatness. The minaret of Jam is one of these legacies. Built in the late 12th century, the minaret was once connected to a great mosque along the riverbank, and evidence of the building and a massive courtyard have also been found near the site. Some scholars have suggested that the minaret is the only remaining structure from the lost city of the Turquoise Mountain, one of the greatest urban civilizations of its time, and a bastion of tolerance, where all religions were accepted. The rest of the lost city perished during Mongol invasions in the 1220s possibly leaving behind only the minaret. Besides the semi-miracle of its survival, the minaret is an incredible work of architecture. Extending 213 feet into the air, the minaret is made completely of tan baked bricks and is intricately carved with Koranic inscriptions of multiple colors. In 2002, the minaret was nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, one of only two in all of Afghanistan. After staying intact for 1000 years, the minaret still faces threats from war, and the harsh climate of Afghanistan. The minaret of Jam is also currently listed as a site in danger, and many fear that another harsh winter, or earthquake could topple the only legacy of the city of Turquoise Mountain.",
10,Tajbeg Palace,"Kabul, Afghanistan",The abandoned palace stands as a wounded but proud beacon of Afghan hope.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tajbeg-palace,"Tajbeg Palace stands atop a knoll dominating Kabul as a concrete allegory to Afghanistan’s recent past. Rusting wheels that once supported the manually-operated cable car that transported Queen Soraya to her husband in the nearby Darul Aman Palace share faded opulence with ornate architraves, hacked marble, and grammatically incorrect Taliban graffiti. Tajbeg Palace, which was designed in the 1920s by European architects, was the idea of Afghan leader Amanullah Khan as part of his modernization program. Informally known as the “Queen’s Palace,” Tajbeg was the home of Queen Soraya Tarzi, herself a modernist and instrumental in Afghan women’s rights until Amanullah’s untimely abdication in the face of increasing religious upheaval. In subsequent years, Tajbeg Palace was used as a military command headquarters and, as such, was a strategic target for belligerents in ensuing regime changes. Whoever sat in Tajbeg held symbolic control of the land around it. On December 27, 1979, Soviet Special Forces, as part of Operation Storm-333, attacked the palace and assassinated President Hafizullah Amin as a precursor to the 10-year Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Tajbeg became home to the Soviet Army 40th Division, then the following communist government, until Mujahideen factions, upon their taking of Kabul in 1992, used Tajbeg as their spiritual home. When the Taliban installed itself as the ruling party they used Tajbeg’s ornate windows and balconies as public execution posts. The Afghan government is once again in control of the battered palace. But due to insufficient funding, its plans to restore the building to its former glory have yet to come to fruition. Today, it’s the palace’s pockmarked exterior where poignancy now reigns. Even after suffering generations of instability and violence the building stands wounded, but proud, as a beacon of Afghan hope.","Access is dependent on current custodians. As with any travel to Afghanistan, caution is advised."
11,Site of Alexandria on the Caucasus,"Bagram, Afghanistan",The West's first incursion into the Afghan world lies buried beneath a military base.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/site-of-alexandria-on-the-caucasus-afghanistan,"The Western world has had a number of troubles with the Afghan world in recent history, but one of the earliest attempts at colonization of the area has been all but forgotten to time. In 329 BC, Alexander the Great founded a city on what was, for him, the edge of the known world. Called Alexandria on the Caucasus, the city was established at the crossroads of ancient trade routes in the land which was to become modern-day Afghanistan. After the initial conquest, 3,000 veterans of his army remained behind to settle there while Alexander marched east to India. Many cities were founded by Alexander in his brief years of conquest and exploration, most famously Alexandria in Egypt, but Alexandria on the Caucasus has remained one of the most elusive to historians. A few years after founding this city, Alexander himself was dead in Babylon. His control of Afghanistan had always been fleeting at best and after his death the empire he had ruled over was fragmented. With the fallout of his death Alexandria on the Caucasus was swiftly forgotten by his successors in Babylon, Egypt, and Macedonia. Ancient accounts of this part of the world paint a picture of a wondrous, magical land: where a city founded by the god of wine himself lay nearby, there were men with no heads, and naked philosophers imparted wisdom. However the Alexandrian Caucasus empire gradually retreated into legend and speculation. The site of Alexandria on the Caucasus lay undisturbed for centuries, until it was rediscovered in July, 1833 by Charles Masson. Masson was an extraordinary character. A deserter from the British army and virtuoso con-artist, he wandered nineteenth-century Afghanistan in a succession of disguises: a faquir, a Frenchman, a spy, a Haji, an American, a healer. Masson recovered thousands of coins and artifacts from the site, many of which are now in the British Museum. Today there is little to be seen of Alexandria on the Caucasus, its remains mostly buried underneath Bagram Airbase, 65km north of Kabul. Despite its historic importance, there is almost nothing left to mark the site of the West’s first brief adventure in Afghanistan.",
12,Ishkashim Border Market,"Ishkashim, Afghanistan",A strip of neutral ground where the people of Tajikistan and Afghanistan come together to trade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ishkashim-market,"Crossing the border from Tajikistan to Afghanistan is often dangerous or outright impossible. But in Afghanistan’s panhandle-shaped Wakhan Corridor, anyone can freely cross the border—even those without a visa. Welcome to the Ishkashim Market, a strip of no man’s land where locals from both countries meet to buy and sell each other’s crafts. The mountainous Panj River is the dividing line between Ishkashim, Tajikistan, and the Afghan town of the same name on the other side. The river is a neutral ground between the two countries, meaning any structure in the center of the river is easily accessible for both Afghans and Tajiks so long as they return to their respective countries after visiting. The Ishkashim Market, located in the center of the Panj River, is exactly that. The border bazaar is accessible to locals from both sides, and occasionally foreign tourists in Tajikistan who have visiting Afghanistan on their bucket list drop by, too. To enter the market, no long immigration process is required; an armed guard will take your passport (preventing you from passing on to the Afghan side) and instruct you to cross a bridge to the market. Inside the Ishkashim Market, you can haggle for delicious food, Afghan trinkets, pakol hats, and Tajik souvenirs. In addition to handcrafted goods, foreign products can also be found, including cheap clothing and household items from China, and more disconcertingly, World Food Programme aid packages for sale. The market is also an optimal spot for people watching. The Ishkashim Market is open every Saturday, unless violence or disease are present in the area. Whenever it’s open, it’s a remarkable display that friendship and commerce can cross both rivers and borders.","Travel through Afghanistan is, of course, dangerous. But Ishkashim is at the base of the Wakhan Corridor, which is generally safe, as is the Pamir region of Tajikistan. You can obtain a tourist visa when you enter Tajikistan at the Dushanbe airport. You will then need to get a GBAO permit to travel to Khorog, the capital of the Pamir region. From there you can catch a bus to Ishkashim on the Tajik side."
13,The Last Operating Synagogue in Afghanistan,"Kabul, Afghanistan","The last operating synagogue in Afghanistan is run by Zablon Simintov, the last remaining Jew in Afghanistan.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-operating-synagogue-in-afghanistan-kabul-afghanistan,"Jews have been living in Afghanistan for the last 1500 years, and their population in 1948 was over 5,000. That all changed in 1951, when the government of Afghanistan allowed all Afghani Jews to emigrate from the country without having to revoke citizenship, and in 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Because of factors like these, by 1996 the population of Jews in Afghanistan had dwindled down from over 5,000 to a meager 10. By the 21st Century, there was only one running synagogue in all of Afghanistan. In 2001 this synagogue, located on Flower Street in Kabul, was home to the last two remaining Jews in the entire country - Zablon Simintov and Ishaq Levin. They were famous for being arch-rivals, and repeatedly turned each other into the Taliban. This feud was the plotline for a New York City play entitled “The Last Two Jews of Kabul.” In 2005, the feud ended when Levin died of natural causes, leaving Simintov as the only remaining Jew in all of Afghanistan. Despite living in complete religious isolation, Simintov has remained in the country for the sake of identity and employment, even though his wife and two daughters live without him in Israel. The difficulties for Simintov’s day to day life are definitely prevalent. When it comes to food, for example, he has had to receive special permission from the nearest rabbi (who lives in Tashkent, Uzbekistan) to slaughter his own meat and call it kosher. Simintov’s Torah was stolen by the Taliban in the early 2000s. He has since focused his efforts towards tracing the stolen Torah to Guantanamo Bay, where he believes the thief is in US custody. Despite the day-to-day cultural awkwardness of living there, he has not budged from his home - he gets funds and care packages from international Jews and sympathetic Afghani Muslims, keeps the synagogue intact, and runs a kebab restaurant with all-Muslim chefs. Recently, his restaurant has been failing, which he blames on the US military’s withdrawal from the area.",
14,Jihad Museum,"Herat, Afghanistan","Museum dedicated to overthrowing the Soviets, complete with diorama of Soviets being beaten to death with shovels.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jihad-museum,"Ismail Khan, a politician and former Mujahideen fighter spent vast amounts of his own fortune to create the Jihad Museum. Khan, along with many others in Herat, the city where the Soviets were defeated in the 1980s, believed the museum was necessary to educate a generation without a frame of reference about the uprising against the Soviet Union. Ostensibly, education is the goal of the museum. However, shock value seems to better sum up the collections and displays in the museum. Constructed in 2010, the museum is filled with paraphernalia from the insurrection and more notably, shocking dioramas depicting the violence. One model even shows and glorifies Soviets being executed in the dirt from point blank range. Another paint and model display shows Soviet soldiers splayed across tanks while being beaten to death with shovels. Along with the grisly dioramas, the museum also hosts a collection of weapons from the era. Russian uniforms are scattered about along with old AK-47s and allegedly, active land mines. Outside of the museum, the collection also has Russian helicopters and fighter jets, surrounded by a well kept garden on the grounds. Although a great deal of the museum seems intended to shock with gratuitous violence, there are some less graphic depictions of the Afghans’ struggle. The museum contains some old photographs of young Mujahideen fighters, some of whom still work at the museum today and have personal beliefs and reservations about their time fighting the Soviets.",
15,Skateistan,"Kabul, Afghanistan","Afghanistan's first skatepark, located in war torn Kabul.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skateistan,"At first glance, Afghanistan, occupied by U.S. forces since 2001, does not seem like a good place for a sport largely associated with American teenagers. But when Australian skateboarders Oliver Percovich and Sharna Nolan arrived in Kabul in 2007, they could scarcely have foreseen the amount of interest their activities would generate. Everywhere that Percovich and Nolan went, they were surrounded by boys and girls of all ages, who wanted to learn how to skate. Despite having just three decks between them, they were able to open a rudimentary skateboarding school. Their success encouraged them to think bigger, and in October 2009 Skateistan, Afghanistan’s first skateboarding school, was opened. The school is built on land donated by the Afghan National Olympic Committee and caters to over 300 students, around half of whom are girls. Most Afghan sports, such as football and kite flying, are generally seen as male activities, but skateboarding is viewed by Afghans as a suitable activity for girls. The school also provides lessons to disabled children and offers classes in art, crafts, and multimedia. In 2011, a documentary about the school was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. Aside from functioning as a skateboarding school, Skateistan was officially registered as an Afghan NGO in July 2009. It works in collaboration with other charity organizations, where it “engage[s] Afghan children through skateboarding and provide[s] them with greater access to education, healthcare and cultural opportunities.”",The park is located in the Afghan National Olympic Committee compound.
16,The Giant Blimp Hovering Over Kabul,"Kabul, Afghanistan",Tethered to a NATO base in Kabul is an American blimp used to survey Afghanistan's largest city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blimp-in-kabul,"The American military has been rapidly shifting its efforts towards surveillance technology - so much so that nowadays, more footage is taken from American surveillance cameras in ten minutes than is uploaded to YouTube in an entire week. One place this increase in surveillance exists is hovering thousands of feet above Kabul, Afghanistan’s largest city. Imagine a giant floating eye 117 feet long and equipped with infrared and color eyesight. An eye which can watch over an entire city’s civilians 24 hours every day without sleeping or even blinking. This is Kabul’s giant blimp. Floating high in the Kabul skies, not disguised or hidden in any way, is a huge white blimp. Nicknamed “the dirigible,” this blimp belongs to the Americans, and it is tethered to the NATO Headquarters in Kabul. An average Kabul resident will see it every time he looks up, no matter what time. It’s always there, in plain sight for millions of people to see. There have been several positive effects that have come from the implementation of the blimp. For instance, on one occasion, the US military used the blimp’s cameras to find a car that was being packed with explosives, and fortunately, they were able to diffuse it in time. That said, many residents live in a state of fear. Mohammadullah, a resident of Kabul, was quoted in the New York Times saying “whenever we want to say ‘hi’ to our wife when we sleep on rooftops, we feel someone is watching us.” When the blimps are brought down due to bad weather, the military often finds hundreds of bulletholes in them, showing that the presence of the blimp is a cause of real resentment in the area. Some US Army leaders have even gone as far as saying that the blimps are ineffective at protecting American lives. The blimp did leave the skies for a short while. In October of 2015, a British military helicopter accidentally collided with one of the blimp’s tethers and crashed, killing five people, including two US soldiers. The blimp became deflated, and it couldn’t be used again. However that wasn’t enough to keep the zeppelin out of the skies. In January 2016, Truthout reported that a new blimp was up there, watching the city streets of Kabul just as it had in the past - business as usual. The blimp’s surveillance capabilities are classified.",
17,Yanar Dağ (Fire Mountain),"Baku, Azerbaijan",Mysterious hillside with a continuously burning natural fire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fire-mountain-yanar-dag,"In the 13th century, when Marco Polo visited the then-Persian city of Baku, he mentioned numerous mysterious flames that could be found all over the region at various places of the Abşeron Peninsula. These fires gave Azerbaijan the moniker “Land of Fire.” Even five centuries after Marco Polo, French writer Alexandre Dumas witnessed natural flames in a mysterious fire temple. One can easily understand how these natural flames must have amazed and terrified people in history, and it doesn’t come as a surprise that the natural fires of Azerbaijan are considered to have played a crucial part in the creation of Zoroastrianism — a mystical faith, centered around ceremonial fire cults, which appeared in the region around 2,000 years ago. The natural flames of Azerbaijan can be attributed to its enormous gas reserves. When exploitation of these reserves began, most of the natural fires burned out, due to a reduction in underground pressure. Of the natural fires that burn today in Azerbaijan, Yanar Dağ is arguably the most impressive. A 10m long wall of fire, that never extinguishes, is burning continuously alongside the edge of the hill, which naturally is at its most spectacular at night, when tourists and locals alike view the fire from a nearby teahouse. Local lore states that it was a shepherd that accidentally ignited the fire in the 1950s by tossing a cigarette, and that it has burnt ever since.",
18,Fire Temple of Baku,"Baku, Azerbaijan",A shrine of fire worship built on top of a natural flame.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fire-temple-of-baku,"Situated on the Abşeron Peninsula, the Fire Temple (Ateşgah) of Baku was a place of sacrifice founded above a natural gas vent. Fire rituals at the peninsula’s numerous natural gas vents date back to at least the 10th century, although the current temple structure was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. The structure is similar to the caravanserais (travellers’ inns) of the region with pentagonal walls surrounding a courtyard. However, in the middle of this courtyard sits an altar, the centerpiece of the temple complex where fire rituals were observed. The altar is situated right a natural gas vent, igniting a large flame in the middle and four smaller flames on the rooftop corners of the pavilion. Surrounding the temple altar are a number of small cells which held the ascetic worshippers and pilgrims. Debate continues as to whether this temple was founded as a Zoroastrian or a Hindu place of worship, since the structure incorporates architectural elements from both faiths, without wholly adhering to either. The most established theory places the temple in the Zoroastrian tradition, but that it has evolved into a predominantly Hindu place of worship over time. In the late 19th century, the place was abandoned, most likely as a result of the dwindling Indian population in Azerbaijan. Heavy exploitation of the natural gas reserves on the peninsula resulted in the exhaustion of the flame in 1969. The flames seen today are fed by Baku’s main gas supply. In 1975, the complex was turned into a museum, and in 1998, it was nominated as an UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
19,Hunot Gorge,"Şuşa, Azerbaijan",A scenic canyon with thick forests and historic ruins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hunot-gorge,"The Hunot Gorge is cut through by the Karkar River, along which Hunot village was founded in the 18th century. The village provided flour to the fortress city of Shushi for over a century until it was abandoned in 1930. But the ruins remain: Twelve of the Hunot flour mills are preserved along the river in the now state-protected canyon. The walls of the gorge are more than 800 feet high, and from the highest point, known as the Jdrdyuz Plateau, visitors can enjoy the breathtaking view of the gorge before following one of several trails down into it. Stone Age caves and historic bridges (one of which, built in 1720, is still used) add to the beauty of the heavily forested canyon. At the bottom of the gorge, overlooking a natural swimming pool, is the base of a waterfall known as Mamrot Kar, which means “Umbrella,” in reference to the shapes of the moss-covered rocks the water falls over. This waterfall is the entrance to a grotto beneath the “umbrellas,” and simple bridges made of logs and large sticks allow access to the grotto from across the river.","The trail through the canyon and past the waterfall is marked, since it is part of the Janapar Trail—a two-week walk across the disputed territory of the Republic of Artsakh.

Called We Are Our Mountains, the looming faces of an old man and woman represent the mountain people of Artsakh and their Armenian heritage. The Republic of Artsakh (previously known as Nagorno-Karabakh) is a disputed territory in a landlocked region within Azerbaijan. Although internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan, it’s governed as a de facto independent state by its Armenian ethnic majority. Its original name, Nagorno-Karabakh, means “mountainous black garden.” We Are Our Mountains is an iconic monument within the unrecognized republic. The image of the monument caused controversy at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, initially due to its appearance in the semi-final introduction and subsequently because it was repeatedly shown by an Armenian spokesperson during the vote following an Azeri request that it be removed. Its image also features heavily in Artsakh’s coat of arms. Locals sometimes refer to it as “tatik-papik” (“grandma and grandpa”) for its two elderly faces. The sculpture, which was installed in 1967, is made from volcanic tufa.","The monument is a short and easy drive from Stepanakert. Visas are no longer required in advance for the Republic of Artsakh and are available upon arrival and registering in Stepanakert. Be aware, however, that these should be issued on a separate piece of paper rather than in your passport as any sign of having been to the region will deny any possibility of entering Azerbaijan or obtaining an Azeri visa."
21,Mud Volcanoes of Azerbaijan,"Baku, Azerbaijan","Home to nearly a third of the world's mud volcanoes, Azerbaijan is home to a messy, bubbling, and sometimes explosive landscape.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mud-volcanoes-of-azerbaijan,"In 2001, in Azerbaijan, something unexpected happened. The ground began to move in an unusual way… “It looked as though an animal was trying to get out of the ground […] There was a big explosion, and a huge flame started coming from the hillside […] The flame was unbelievably big, about three hundred meters high. It was surrounded by dense, black smoke, and lots of mud was being thrown into the air,” recounted a local. Visible from 15 kilometers (nine miles) away, three days later the flames were still burning. What had taken place was an eruption, not one of magma, but of mud. Known as “mud volcanoes,” they form in places where pockets of underground gas have found a weak spot in the earth where they can force their way to the surface. Because they are not caused by magma, the mud volcanoes, rather than being hot, can be very cold indeed, often just above freezing. Over a thousand mud volcanoes are known to exist in the world, and some 400 of those are in the coastal area of Azerbaijan. While mud volcanoes (also known as “sedimentary volcanoes”) never grow to the size of a normal volcano, topping out at around 10 km in diameter and 700 meters in height, (among the largest mud volcanoes in the world are Boyuk Khanizadagh and Turaghai, both in Azerbaijan) they do occasionally get the chance to show off, as happened in 2001. Every 20 years or so, one of these mud/gas volcanoes will ignite deep below the surface and create a massive explosion. While generally not dangerous to people, as they are far outside of most city centers, it is believed that six shepherds and over 2,000 sheep were killed by a mud volcano in Bozdagh, Azerbaijan. There is a silver lining to having a country covered in mud volcanoes. Mud volcanoes are closely associated with hydrocarbon and petrochemical stores underground, hence the gas trying to escape to the surface. A few of these gas leaks are constantly on fire, shooting small perpetual flames into the air and some believe that these perpetual flames are strongly connected to the appearance of the Zoroastrian religion in Azerbaijan some 2,000 years ago.",
22,Museum of Miniature Books,"Baku, Azerbaijan","A gigantic collection of teeny, tiny books.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-miniature-books,"In the old city of Baku, Azerbaijan, resides the only museum in the world dedicated to miniature editions of books. The tiny library of books ins the museum is the result of the private collection of Zarifa Salahova, and has been amassed over the period of more than 30 years. In 2002, when she opened the museum, she finally shared her collection with the public. A large portion of the books also stem from the donation of a Ukrainian collector, who presented his petite books to Salahova in 2001. The museum has several thousands of the fairy-sized books, including miniature editions of works of Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Gogol, and Chukovsky. The books originate from around the world, and are written in numerous languages, including Azeri, Russian, English, and German. The oldest book in the museum is a miniature copy of the Quran, dating to the 17th century, while the smallest tome (6mm x 9mm) is the Russian book “The Most Miraculous Thing,” which can only be read by using a magnifying glass. Salahova, herself a dedicated bibliophile, opened the museum to motivate the next generation of readers to engage with reading and literature. She has also published a few miniature books herself, including the Constitution of Azerbaijan, which is also on display in the museum.",
23,Bottle House of Ganja,"Ganja, Azerbaijan",A quirky house created entirely out of glass bottles combines a collector's spirit with an artist's flair.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bottle-house-ganja,"People express their loves in a lot of ways. Collecting is one. People the world over pick a subject they like, start saving tokens they particularly like, and before long they have an array worthy of showing off. Construction is another. Instead of collecting objects, they build them, paint them, or cobble them together. These two hobbies don’t intersect often, but when they do, it’s always impressive. The Bottle House, a local icon in Ganja, Azerbaijan is a perfect example of this synthesis. An entire house ostensibly constructed entirely out of glass bottles, this abode is unlike any most will ever see. Mottled with shimmering colors, translucent in the summer sun, the Bottle House reflects and refracts light that passes through its walls like a prism in a window. The thousands of bottles that cover its walls are delicately placed to create works of art – mosaics that form portraits, words, and designs on every square inch of the building. The Bottle House is a private residence – there are no fees to take a look, but also no hours or official guided tours. That doesn’t stop numerous visitors and passers-by from coming to marvel at the feat of both engineering and creativity that were used to create it. Call it a collection, or call it a work of art, but the closest description of this house is that it’s both. Visitors can support the maintenance costs of the house by shopping at the homemade souvenir stand under the porch whenever open.","It's about a block from Alexander Nevsky Church, but if you get lost, just show a photo to almost any local and they'll help you out."
24,Candy Cane Mountains,"Siyazan, Azerbaijan",Swirling layers of white and red rock earned these mountains their festive nickname.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/candy-cane-mountains,"On the highway between Baku and Quba in Azerbaijan, a series of red-and-white striped peaks emerge suddenly from the surrounding landscape. Part of the Greater Caucasus mountain range, the Candy Cane Mountains earned their nickname thanks to their striking resemblance to the classic Christmas treat. The color of these rocks is a product of the area’s unique geology. The Candy Cane Mountains are made of shale, a type of sedimentary rock made up of many thin layers stacked on top of each other. Long ago, before the rock was formed, changes in the environment led to differing mineral composition as the layers of sediment were deposited. As the shale came in contact with water, layers that contained iron oxidized and turned red, while layers without iron remained shades of white and gray. Over time, tectonic movement and erosion have exposed these sedimentary layers into a visual representation of geologic history. The Candy Cane Mountains also contain many belemnites, fossils of an extinct order of squid-like creatures from the Cretaceous period.","The Candy Cane Mountains are located about 50 miles from Baku on E119. You can drive to the area or take a guided tour. The main area is located just off the road and there are a few small trails through the hills. Bring plenty of food and water, as there are no facilities in the area and the nearest market is about 30 minutes away. There is no entry fee."
25,Musical Stone of Gobustan,"Baku, Azerbaijan","Resonant stone, that has been played since prehistoric times.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/musical-stone-gobustan,"The Gobustan National Park is an otherworldly place. More than four hundred mud volcanoes are found within the area – half of all mud volcanoes in the world. Additionally, there are bizarre rock formations, burning gas vents, prehistoric petroglyphs – and the large musical stone, called Gaval Dash (Qavaldaş). Two meters long, the stone resonates a tambourine-like sound when it is “played” by hitting it with smaller stones. It is assumed to have been used since ancient times to play ritual melodies, used for the archaic Yallı chain-dance, which is portrayed at some of the petroglyphs at Gobustan – and which is still performed in Azerbaijan to this day. Other rocks in the Gobustan area have proven to have similar capabilities, which are thought to be the result of a combination of the unique climate and the effect of the natural gas within the region. A number of Azeri musicians have used the hypnotic sound of the rock to create pieces of music, partly in combination with other instruments, or chanting. The musical stone and the Yallı chain-dance also featured in the interval act of the semi-final of the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest in Baku.",
26,Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum,"Baku, Azerbaijan",A unique museum dedicated to culture and artistry of carpet weaving.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/azerbaijan-national-carpet-museum,"In Azerbaijan, the art of carpet weaving is one of the most important aspects of culture and history. So naturally, the country is home to a museum dedicated to carpets and rugs—at the time of its establishment, the only one of its kind. The museum was founded in 1967 and originally housed in the Juma Mosque in the Old City district of Baku. In 1991 it was relocated to the former Lenin Museum on Neftchilar Avenue, and in 2014 it moved again to a new building in the seaside park. The current museum building, designed by the Austrian architect Franz Janz, is intended to resemble a massive rolled carpet. The Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum is home to the largest collection of Azerbaijani carpets in the world, some dating back to the 17th century, as well as archaeological artifacts and folk crafts, including ceramics, oil lamps, embroidery and jewelry. It also serves as a research site, where the art of traditional carpet weaving and its modern legacy are studied and discussed. On the first floor of the museum, visitors can walk through a timeline of Azerbaijani carpet weaving, from simple woven mats made from reed or cane to more complex woven forms. There are also weaving tools on display like looms, wool, ropes, and carpet bags. The second floor is filled with pile carpets, divided into distinct groups. Displays show information about common motifs found in Azerbaijani folk art, such as buta, dragons, the tree of life, different styles of crosses, and Islamic symbols. A 17th-century carpet called “Ajdahali,” the oldest carpet in the museum’s collection, is also on display here. The third floor focuses on modern carpeting, and how the art has developed through the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Among the artists featured is Latif Karimov, a prominent carpet designer and scientist who played a role in the establishment of the museum.","Entry is 7 AZN for adults, 3 AZN for students and free for children under 6. The museum is open every day except Mondays, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and to 8 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday."
27,The Yanar Bulag Fire Spring,"Astara, Azerbaijan","Spring that emits water and fire at the same time is said to have remedial properties, and sparked its own religion.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fire-spring-yanar-bulag,"The fire spring Yanar Bulag (which literally translates to “burning spring”), close to the city of Astara in southern Azerbaijan, is an unusual spring which fascinatingly combines the two elements fire and water. The phenomenon starts simply enough. Water comes gurgling from a metal stand-pipe inside a small pavilion, not looking particularly unusual. But when a lighter or another ignition source is touched to the water, the liquid itself will be set ablaze. This unique and entertaining property of the water is due to its uniquely high methane content.. Despite the methane in the water, water from the spring is said by locals to have remedial properties. People come from all over the region to collect water from the spring. Similarly, for tourists it has become almost a rite of passage to take a mouthful of the water while the top of the pipe is being set ablaze. The fire spring is but one of many weird sites in Azerbaijan that can be attributed to the country’s high gas and oil reserves. Aside from being a quirky attraction, the fire spring also evokes the spririt of Zoroastrianism, a religion in which fire and water are considered agents of ritual purity. Today, Zoroastrianism no longer exists in the country, but it was in this region that the religion was founded 2,000 years ago. Perhaps this is not surprising, considering these unusual and fascinating local phenomena.",
28,Ağdam,"Akna, Azerbaijan","Azerbaijani ghost town, decaying after a war left it an armed forces buffer zone.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agdam-ghost-city,"The fall of the Soviet Union left much of Eastern Europe in chaos. From the rubble of the fallen Russian behemoth, an Armenian autonomous nation called the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic arose in the nation of Azerbaijan, causing a vicious war that eventually left the town of Ağdam in ruins, completely abandoned and falling apart. Shells bombarded the town of 40,000, reducing many of the buildings to crumbling and smoldering remains. As the invasion raged through 1993, every resident was forced to flee the area. Once the town was abandoned, the Armenian military spitefully destroyed most of the remains of the town, so it could never fall into Azerbaijani hands again. Today, only the bombed-out skeletons of buildings remain, along with the former town’s mosque, which is badly damaged and was being used to house Armenian livestock. Although the area is no longer embroiled in conflict, Ağdam is a ghost town and is used as a buffer zone by the Armenian military.

29,Palace of the Shaki Khans,"Shaki, Azerbaijan",Foreign invaders almost left this lovely Caucasus palace alone—almost.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palace-of-the-shaki-khans,"At the foot of the Caucasus mountains lies an escape: a wooden chalet called the Palace of the Shaki Khans. Gorgeous but tiny, it was built as a prayer that the world’s revolutions would pass by the Caucasus. Unfortunately for the Shaki Khans, they didn’t. The Shaki Khans’ summer palace is located a few hours from Baku, an ancient city that today is rapidly replacing its stone buildings with glass skyscrapers. Perched high in the Caucasus mountains, the palace itself looks like the setting for a Wes Anderson movie. It is painstakingly symmetrical and more cosmopolitan than one might think for a mountain refuge. French stained glass, Russian wood, Ottoman ceramics, and Iranian mirrorwork decorate all of the facets. One can easily imagine the early 1800s, when the Shaki princes sat in its now-quiet halls, speaking of their grandeur. Those same princes spent their nights fearing what would happen when the world’s warlords would finally discover their corner of the mountains. Surrounded as it is by mile-high peaks, there is no good reason for Shaki to be targeted by an invading army. The town is located in what is now Azerbaijan, but for thousands of years, it remained a forgotten front as wars between the Ottoman, Russian, and Persian empires raged on all sides. Shaki’s rulers (called “khans”) were quite happy with this arrangement. They were free to sell their silk to the world, free from the greater region’s rampaging hordes. Today, visitors can march through the palace like the Russian army eventually did in 1819. You can gape at the tile work, which depicts the bearded Shaki cavalry bearing pikes topped with mustachioed heads, or squint at the sun setting into mirrors carved like a Tsarina’s ring. While getting lost in the delicate finery of the palace’s details, one finds the mind wandering into territory involving the intricacies of maintaining the daily rituals of a fantasy kingdom in the Caucasus, and what the invading army might have felt when they burst the Shaki’s bubble.",

Its immobile white walls look as though they’ve been frozen mid-ripple. The abstract architecture is unlike anything else in the capital city. The Heydar Aliyev Center, which was designed by renowned architect Zaha Hadid and completed in 2012, is rumored to be one of the most expensive buildings per square foot. Its rolling, flowing design made waves within architectural, engineering, and design circles and garnered it much prestigious international recognition. Its odd design stands in stark contrast to the Soviet Modernist styles typically found throughout Baku. Inside, the building offers a tranquil environment full of white space and curved lines. The center contains a museum, gallery hall, and auditorium. Its fluid, folding walls are symbolic of its relationship with the physical and cultural landscape of the city. The entire design is meant to represent Azerbaijan’s dedication to blending its past with its future, as evidenced by the building’s slogan of, “To the future with values!” However, the center’s unconventional architecture and groundbreaking design weren’t the only things to put it on the world map. According to the Human Rights Watch, the government forcefully displaced locals to make room for the urban development initiative the center was part of.

Though the exact details of its origins are not known, historical evidence points to a fortification at this site dating back to the first century, established by the Armenian lords of Syunik. The mountaintop fortress had dozens of buildings, including barracks, warehouses, a bathhouse, stables, kitchens, an arsenal, treasury, and the ruler’s palace. It is surrounded by thick stone walls, and accessible by a steep hiking path. Over the centuries, multiple families of lords came and went, but the imposing fortress stands still on its sloped foundation in the slope of a mountain in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, a large exclave of Azerbaijan. From its position overlooking the Alinjachay, it has withstood many attacks. A common story holds that, in the 14th century, the fortress survived a 14-year siege.

32,The Maiden Tower,"Baku, Azerbaijan",This mysterious but iconic tapered tower appears in many Azeri fairytales and legends.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maiden-tower,"The Maiden Tower is the oldest structure in Baku’s old walled city. No one is entirely sure when it was built, or for what purpose, or even the origins of the name. Yet this mysterious and curious tower is a symbol of Azerbaijan’s capital city and even appears on the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat. Many experts believe the tower was completed in the 12th century, along with most of the medieval walled city. But the different appearance of the stones that form the foundation and the first three stories suggests the original structure may date as far back as 600 BC. As this predates the arrival of the Islamic religion, it’s possible the building began as a Zoroastrian temple. It’s also been suggested that the tower could have been used as an astronomical observatory, speculation corroborated by the correlation between stone protrusions at the upper and lower levels and the lunar cycle. The Maiden Tower is 97 feet tall and 54 feet in diameter at the base, which narrows gradually moving upward. The truncated cone shape, thickness of the walls, and deep foundations are likely responsible for the longevity of the tower. Baku’s enigmatic tower has certainly taken hold of local folklore, being the stage where many popular legends unfold. The most famous of these tales tells the story of a king’s daughter who took her own life by jumping off the top of the tower to escape from a marriage of strategic convenience. According to the legend, this is how the tower acquired its name. Several variations of this story exist and have been expressed in the form of poems, plays, fairytales, and a famous ballet.","Inside the Maiden Tower is a museum dedicated to the history of the city of Baku. For a fee, you can climb to the top of the tower, which offers excellent views of the city and the bay."

More than two centuries prior to World War II, what were formally known as the Highland Jews in Azerbaijan lived in fear of their own neighbors and members of competing religious factions. Unable to gain a foothold in any majorly settled area, the Highland Jews found themselves unsupported and disproportionally scattered throughout the region. A decision was made to form a purpose-built settlement across the river from the region of Quba, where the strength of community and larger numbers might protect the Jews from undue hardships. Not long after the settlement began, an official status was formally proposed as the state of Yevreiskaya Sloboda, or Jewish Town, and the Khan of Quba granted the town protected status, allowing the continued organization and settlement of Jewish citizens in large numbers without fear of discrimination, retribution, or clashes with neighboring towns and states. The ensuing history of the town would closely follow the major events of Eastern Europe as a whole, with citizens once again fearing for the worst as renewed fighting and waves of persecution swept through the Jewish communities of the continent at large. At the outset of World War II, the Jews of Yevreiskaya Sloboda were relatively shielded from the horrors of Nazi-occupied Europe due to the town’s location inside the newly-formed Soviet Union. To reflect that association, the town’s name was officially changed to Krasnaya Sloboda, or Red Town. Today, Yevreiskaya Sloboda faces the new and daunting challenge of a dwindling population, as a majority of its citizens have left for Israel or other now-safe locations in Europe or North America. At its height, nearly 18,000 Jews inhabited Yevreiskaya Sloboda, but the town’s numbers now barely surpass 3,500. As a result, many of the beautifully architectured buildings, with their long and rich history, sit abandoned or in disrepair.",

In Azerbaijan, a country whose wealth has been built around its vast oil and gas reserves, and has been known since ancient times as the “Land of Fire,” people seem to be less concerned about the health risks of crude oil. On the contrary, in the small town of Naftalan, local oil is even regarded as having beneficial therapeutic effects, and people are happy to bathe in it. Naftalan, as local scientists eagerly point out, is the only place in the world in which oil has (allegedly) thermal qualities. Naftalan (literally translated as “taking the oils”) is thus the only spa town in the world where treatments do not involve water, but oil. Astonishingly, the first accounts of the healing oil of Azerbaijan were made by Marco Polo in the 13th century. He had never visited Naftalan, but noted in his travel accounts stories of magical therapeutic oil springs he had heard about in the area of today’s Azerbaijan. At the end of the 19th century, a German chemist began to export bottled oil from Naftalan, which soon became extremely popular in Russia and neigboring countries. The spa is not one of those contemporary ethereal beauty temples, but rather a clinical Soviet sanatorium-style affair. A number of treatments are offered, but the most popular is to simply bathe in the black stuff, which after a bathing session, is thoroughly scrubbed down the body. During the Soviet Union, when the spa town had its heyday, Naftalan was one of the most important spa towns in the Caucasus region, and received up to 75,000 visitors annually. Immediately after Azerbaijan’s independence, when relations with Russia notably cooled down and the Caucasus fell into a number of violent conflicts, Naftalan received very few guests. Back then, a number of the sanatoria had been turned into refugee camps for IDPs, who fled the horrors of the Armenia-Azerbaijan war. In recent years, the local government is working hard to restore Naftalan to its former glory, and hopes to attract Western tourists in the near future. The oil of Naftalan is claimed to be especially beneficial against psoriasis, arthritis and rheumatism.",

Estimated at over 2,030 years old the tree has grown massive, with a circumference reaching almost 90 feet and a height of over 170 feet. The hollow trunk is reportedly big enough for more than 100 people to fit inside. Some suggest that Tnjri, which in the Karabakh dialect means plane-tree, is the largest plane-tree (Platanus orientalis L.) in the world. According to lore of the local Armenian population, the tree was said to have been visited by many Armenian greats, including the inventor of the Armenian alphabet, Mesrop Mashtots, in the 5th century; Armenia’s first historian, Movses Khorenatsi also in the 5th century; and the musician and poet Sayat-Nova in the 18th century. The size and age of the tree has also garnered the plant a spiritual significance among the local people, many of whom see the tree as sacred. There is even a legend that states that anyone who burns it down will die within seven days. This likely arose as a manner of protecting the ancient arbor since it has survived multiple close calls with arsonists trying to set it ablaze over the years. At one point the problem was so bad a full time guard had to be posted under the tree. Despite the many attempts at its life, Tnjri has survived through long eras and regimes. When the country was under Soviet control, Tnjri was said to be the tallest tree in Russia. However through it all Tnjri has remained an important shrine to the local people and a popular site for visitors looking a see a physical symbol of Armenia’s history.","By foot from Karmir Shuka (Red Market), visitors can follow the Janapar Trail up the hill to Tnjri. Blue markers (some with a yellow foot) denote the trail. The tree is also accessible by car from the main North-South Highway."
36,Lahıc,"Lahıc, Azerbaijan",The village's cobblestone streets are lined with shops displaying exquisite copper craftsmanship.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lahic,"Lahıc is a village in the Great Caucasus mountains that’s packed with wonderful artisanal shops. Part and parcel of a visit to Lahıc is not just what you see, but also what you hear. Upon stepping in the village, the first sounds you’ll hear are usually those of metal being hammered in and out of shape, and metal clanging together as the shop owners re-arrange their merchandise. A walk along Lahıc’s photogenic cobblestone alleys reveals a wealth of shops selling masterfully crafted copperware, and perhaps more interestingly, a glimpse at how coppersmiths can bring these wares to life. These artisans are not only keen on demonstrating their skills—they are also storytellers, and if you can overcome language barriers, you can learn about the artisans’ families and ancestry. Items for sale include swords, daggers, statuettes, cups, plates, pitchers, kettles, alembics, cooking utensils, farming tools, incense burners, jewelry, and more, both new and old. The Azerbaijan Museum of National History has several copperware items manufactured in Lahıc on display. Make no mistake: Lahıc is touristy. During those stuffy summer weekends, throngs of people flock here from Baku seeking cooler temperatures and a touch of Azeri traditions. Yet, visit Lahıc in winter and you’re likely to be the only tourist in town. For architecture buffs, Lahıc has a 1,000-year-old sewage system that has defied countless earthquakes.","Lahıc can be reached using public transport. People heading to Lahıc can take a marshrutka, which leaves at irregular intervals from Ismailli, a small town well-connected to Baku by public transport. The road from Ismailli to Lahic is scenic but at times hair-raising, with steep drops at an uncomfortably close distance."

The first oil platform in Azerbaijan, Neft Daşları was also the first operating offshore oil platform in the world. What began as a single path out over the water in 1959 slowly grew into a full city over the years as paths and platforms were built on the back of ships that were submerged into the sea to serve as a foundation for the expanding structure. With a population of about 5,000 today, Neft Daşları is constructed on top of landfill, dirt, and other industrial detritus tossed out into the water. After two years of construction, in 1951, Neft Daşları was ready for production. Oil tanks were installed and drilling platforms erected and the city’s first oil was tanked out that same year. The city expanded so quickly in the first decade of operation that nine-story hotels, cultural palaces, bakeries, and other sites were built up by 1958. Two decades later another boom (1976-1978) saw the construction of a five-story dormitory and two oil-gas compressor stations. Those years also brought residents a drinking water facility, two underwater pipelines, and a flyover for vehicular traffic. When the 60th anniversary of Neft Daşları was celebrated in November 2009, it was announced that the city had produced, since its founding, more than 170 million tons of oil and plenty of natural gas. It’s unclear what will happen to the city and its residents when the oil reserves buried deep under the sea run dry. It is estimated that the reserves could hold only 30 million more tons.",

There are more than 6,000 pieces of art at the site, with representations of plants, animals, and various human cultures. The Norwegian explorer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl visited this site in Azerbaijan four times between 1981 and 2000.

The hustle and bustle of Sadarghat can be overwhelming, with boats carrying produce, laborers unloading boxes, and a wild variety of vehicles transporting the goods to their next destination. The streets are packed, the smells pungent, the colors vivid, and the sounds disorienting. In the mayhem that is Sadarghat, the Ahsan Manzil compound is a fenced-off oasis of unexpected peace and quiet. Built between 1859 and 1872, Ahsan Manzil served as the residence of the Nawab of Dhaka. These days, the palace is a reminder of Bangladesh’s colonial past. Its ostentatious Western architecture incorporates elements of Mughal design, a popular trend among the affluent and aristocratic elite of Dhaka in the 18th and 19th centuries. After being largely abandoned upon the Newab’s death, Ahsan Manzil was restored and turned into a museum in 1985. The building is dominated by a large dome that caps an octagonal room, and a wide staircase leading to an arched portal. Along the façade of the building are porticoes that offer expansive views of the Buringa River. Apart from its architecture, Ahsan Manzil is famous for its bright pink color.","Ahsan Manzil is located on the north bank of the Buringa River, about 650 feet east of Babubazar bridge, along Gabtoli Road."
40,Lakkatura Tea Garden,"Sylhet, Bangladesh",One of the largest and most scenic of Bangladesh's tea gardens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lakkatura-tea-garden,"Sylhet, in the northeast of Bangladesh, is renowned for the beauty of its tea gardens, and among the lot, Lakkatura is considered the most scenic. It is also one of the largest tea gardens in the country, covering a total of 3,200 acres. This estate was officially established in 1875, and it now produces an astounding 550 tons of tea each year. A number of dirt roads intersect the garden, some purpose-built to transport tea across and beyond the grounds. Others are simply part of a larger network of roads cutting through Lakkatura, taking visitors through hills of neatly manicured rows of tea plants. Following the latter set of roads takes you to several rural villages in and around Lakkatura estate, including makeshift villages where migrant workers live during the harvest. The British East India Company first introduced tea cultivation in Bangladesh in 1840, but it was only in 1857 that tea became a commercial occupation. In 2012, Bangladesh produced more than 70,000 tons of tea. In spite of its small size, the South Asian country is the 12th-largest tea producer in the world, employing more than 300,000 people. The industry is supervised by the Bangladesh Tea Board and the Bangladesh Tea Research Institute.","Lakkatura Tea Garden is a few minutes from the center of Sylhet. The easiest way to get to the estate is by CNG (a kind of autorickshaw used all over Bangladesh). Upon arrival at Lakkatura, you can either report to the main office, where you can hire a guide or listen to a lecture about the Lakkatura Tea Garden, or you can wander around the garden by yourself. It is not rare to come across newlyweds having their wedding pictures taken at the picturesque tea garden."
41,Lala Khal,"Lala Khal, Bangladesh",A beautiful stretch of Bangladeshi river known for its high quality sand is possibly more remarkable for its color changing water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lala-khal,"In the northeast corner of Bangladesh, at the border with India, the Himalayas stop. The Himalayas (Sanskrit for “abode of the snow”) dissolve into gentle slopes blanketed in shrubs of tea, and the snow, melted, flows into Bangladesh in the Shari-Goyain River. Just on the Bangladesh side, on the banks of the blue river, is an area called Lala Khal. Lala Khal is about 26 miles from Sylhet, the micropolitan capital of Sylhet Division, Bangladesh’s tea production epicenter. The locals have only recently started calling Sylhet a city; before, it was just a town. From there, the best way to get to Lala Khal is on a public bus. For 60 taka each (78 US cents), a bus destined for Jaflong drops off passengers all along the way, including at Sarighat, the gateway to Lala Khal. On the way, locals point out the growing hills: “India.” At Sarighat, between the highway and the river, stalls sell everything: biscuits, toothpaste, potato chips, and cigarettes. Lighters dangle from strings tied to the ceilings. In the early summer, pyramids of watermelons line the road, and red, juicy slices sit perched atop the piles, beckoning flies and buyers. Below, on the river, men sit smoking among summer fruits piled high in small boats. A few steps away from the bus stop, a concrete staircase descends to the riverbank, where a row of colorful boats, called “nokas” in Bengali, wait for visitors. The boat operators, called “nokawallahs,” flock to tourists and demand prices three times what might be considered fair. For a foreigner, an hour ride on a private boat, all the way to the border, should cost between 800 and 1000 taka (around 10 USD). The nokawallah starts the engine with oil from a water bottle, and the boat cruises past hearts carved into rocks and women doing laundry. Swimming boys splash and wave. After a while, the boat stops at the Lala Khal Tea Estate, where tea grows in winding rows and the laborers and their families live in a self-contained village. On the slope rising from the river, a sign warns against crossing into India. Several feet beyond, the India Border Guard keeps watch. Later in the year, at the height of monsoon season, the river will rise several feet. The riverbanks will become unrecognizable, and the water will turn murky and brown. But in the brutally hot early summer, the water is still cool and crystal blue. Floating there in the South Asian summer, it’s possible to forget fear and worry: on the way back to Sarighat, sitting on top of a noka canopy, the most beautiful setting sun in Bangladesh will dry your wet clothes.",
42,Panam Nagar,"Sonargaon, Bangladesh",This historic textile city was abandoned after being ravaged by fire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/panam-nagar,"In its heyday, Panam Nagar was home to a prosperous community of Hindu merchants that turned the medieval Bengali capital into a thriving textile trading hub in the 19th century. It’s no coincidence that the East India Company set up its permanent offices in Panam Nagar (Panam City), which was then the Bengali capital. Yet if textiles brought wealth to the town, they likely contributed to its downfall as well. Uncertainty surrounds the origins of the fire that razed much of the historic city to the ground, but the fact that such a large number of textiles were stored in the buildings here made the area a huge fire hazard. It is also not clear whether the Hindu community abandoned Panam Nagar before or after the rumor that the town was haunted began. What is known is that what’s left of Panam Nagar has been left derelict for decades, and locals have nicknamed it “Ghost City” and “City of the Dead.” Only 52 of the city’s original buildings are still standing. Most are two-story structures, standing one attached to the other along the main thoroughfare. The oldest of these buildings is said to date back to the 15th century, but most are from the 19th century. It is obvious that these were buildings made for affluent residents, judging from the colonial architecture, the thickness of the walls, and their endurance in spite of decades of neglect.","Panam Nagar is in Sonargaon, about 18 miles (30 km) southeast of Dhaka, along the Meghna River. It can be reached by bus from Gulistan Station in Dhaka, but this may take an inordinate amount of time due to traffic and frequent stops. Should you decide to take this option, the bus stop for Panam Nagar is Magrapara Crossing, from which a rickshaw can take you to Panam Nagar. The other option is to take a taxi from Dhaka to Panam Nagar and back. Depending on your negotiating skills, the whole affair can be very affordable. Due to the level of disrepair, it is ill-advised to enter some of the abandoned houses in Panam Nagar."
43,Cox's Bazar Beach,"Cox's Bazar District, Bangladesh",One of the longest natural sand beaches in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/coxs-bazar-beach,"Stretching a remarkable 75 miles in length, Cox’s Bazar Beach is one of the longest uninterrupted natural sand beaches in all of Bangladesh. Most of Cox’s Bazar is 660 feet wide at high tide, and 1,300 feet wide at low tide. This Bay of Bengal beach is quite unknown to the international beach-loving crowd. But Cox’s Bazar is one of the most visited destinations in Bangladesh. Along its 75 miles, different sections of Cox’s Bazar Beach have distinct names, usually referring to the flora and fauna in the area. Among the most popular sections are Laboni Beach, Humchari Beach, and Inani Beach, all doable on one-day trips from the town of Cox’s Bazar, where most accommodation is located. Further south is Teknaf Beach. In general, the further south you go, the bluer the ocean, and the smaller the crowd. If you stay near Cox’s Bazar town, brace yourself for throngs of people. This can be frustrating if you were expecting a deserted tropical beach, but it can a great opportunity to get closer to the Bangladeshi notion of a beach holiday. Founded in 1869, Cox’s Bazar is named after Captain Hiram Cox, superintendent of the British East India Company, which was stationed in Palongkee (the town’s former name). This is an anomaly in the subcontinent, where most colonial place names have been changed, and it is probably due to the positive effect of Captain Cox’s rehabilitation work with the Arakanese refugees.","The easiest and fastest of getting to Cox’s Bazar is by plane. There are daily flights to Dhaka and Chittagong. For those not afraid of sitting in the traffic for hours, buses are also available. There is not a huge supply of accommodation, but in and near Cox’s Bazar town there are both high-end and budget options, including a handful of eco-lodges. A couple of warnings. This is not Cancun or Pattaya. Local people are extremely friendly, but you have to remember that Bangladesh is a conservative Muslim country. The attire for both men and women should be modest, even while swimming. Once you go beyond Cox’s Bazar town, you will find few (if any) facilities. If venturing south, you should plan on being self-reliant. Be careful with quicksand, especially during low tide."
44,National Assembly of Bangladesh,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",Ancient and modern architecture are joined in Louis Kahn's monument to democracy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-assembly-of-bangladesh,"The masterpiece of American architect Louis Kahn, the National Assembly of Bangladesh (Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban) is both graceful and monumental in its union of modern design with ancient references. Construction started in 1961, but it wasn’t completed until nine years after Kahn’s death in 1983. The project was interrupted by the country’s liberation war from Pakistan, which also transformed Kahn’s vision from an imposing government headquarters to a tribute to the proud new democracy of Bangladesh. It was built with concrete inlaid with white marble, giving it a simplicity that relates to the other buildings in the city and makes it resistant to the extreme Bengali desert climate. Private offices overlook the water and a man-made moat ripples between the main building and the rest of the complex. Kahn’s love of rationalism through geometry is everywhere, from the shapes and lines structuring the exterior to the interior corridors circling the main hall. The rooms glow with natural light let in by the geometric shapes, which also contribute to a natural interior environmental control system. The High Court of Bangladesh recently passed a decision to secure the preservation of Kahn’s original vision from any future alterations.",
45,Star Mosque,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",A tiny mosque decorated with mosaics using an early form of recycling.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/star-mosque,"When the Star Mosque (or Tara Masjid in Bengali) in Dhaka was first built in the first half of the 19th century, the original Mughal design included a large dome in the center and two smaller ones on each side. Through the years, additions were built and the interior was decorated—changes that were met with criticism, as they subverted the architectural sensibilities of the Mughal style. Today, with the old design all but gone, the main appeal of the mosque is the striking mosaics decorating it. The artisans who created these patterns used a technique called Chinitikri, which uses broken shards of China porcelain as mosaic pieces. (Pieces of broken bottles were also used at times because colored ceramics were costly.) The size of the pieces varied from half an inch to 2.5 inches, and the preferred shapes were rhomboid and triangular. The mosque is now one of the few extant examples of an architectural work decorated with Chinitikri-style mosaics. Most notable is the Chinitikri blue star motif that gives the structure its popular name, Star Mosque. Hundreds of blue-colored stars adorn the white marble domes, and this star theme is echoed by the mosaics of flowers and rosettes found on the façade and the interior of the mosque.","As with most places in Dhaka, ask a CNG driver to take you there. The mosque is located in the Armanitola area of Old Dhaka."
46,Lalbagh Fort,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",The untimely death of a dignitary's daughter led to this fort being abandoned before it was ever finished.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lalbagh-fort,"During the height of the Mughal Empire, in 1677, Prince Muhammad Azam commissioned the construction of Lalbagh Fort, but the project was never completed. Soon after construction began, Prince Muhammad Azam left Dhaka to join his father, Emperor Aurangzeb, in Delhi. He passed the job to complete the fort down to Shaista Khan, who continued to build it until his beloved daughter Pari Bibi died there in 1684. Shaista Khan, believing the fort was cursed, halted construction immediately, and it remains in its unfinished state today. The discontinuation of the project met with no objection from Prince Muhammad Azam who was, at the time, engaged to Pari Bibi. Three main sections of the fort are complete, namely the Mausoleum of Pari Bibi, Diwan-i-Aam (the Hall of Audience), and Quilla Mosque. The Mausoleum of Pari Bibi consists of a white marble room with the tomb in the center. Access to the room is restricted. The Hall of Audience, which used to be the residence of the Mughal governor, is a two-story building that now houses a museum showcasing Mughal items such as coins, paintings, carpets, and weapons. Quilla Mosque is a relatively small mosque with three elegant domes. These three structures are surrounded by manicured gardens, which also contain a bathing tank overgrown with vegetation. An intricate web of underground tunnels was also finished below Lalbagh Fort. In an episode of the Sepoy Revolution, in 1857, it is said that soldiers on both sides ventured into the tunnels and never resurfaced, adding to the mystery and intrigue that envelops the fort. To this day, rumors circulate that Lalbagh Fort is haunted.","Roads around Old Dhaka can be confusing. Narrow alleys and newly built multi-lane roads are equally congested, making navigation challenging. As there is no shortage of rickshaws in the area, this is the best way to reach Lalbagh Fort."
47,Curzon Hall,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",The fight to make Bengali an official language started in this stunning university hall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/curzon-hall,"In 1948, when Pakistan and Bangladesh were one country, the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan chose Urdu and English to be its official languages. This event occurred within the walls of this impressive Bangladesh university building and sparked the Bengali Language Movement, which advocated the use of Bengali as an official language. Because the government feared retaliation from the Bengali-speaking population, it banned public meetings and rallies. This didn’t stop students and activists at the University of Dhaka from organizing. In 1952, police killed a number of students demonstrating their support for the movement, which prompted countrywide unrest that subsequently claimed thousands of lives. Bengali was eventually granted the status of official language in 1956. Imbued in the Bengali Language Movement were the seeds of independence, which led to the Bangladesh Liberation War and the establishment of Bangladesh as an independent country in 1971. February 21 is now International Mother Language Day, a national holiday. Now, history and everyday life rub shoulders at Curzon Hall. Though originally built to house a town hall, it’s currently home to the Faculty of Science at the University of Dhaka. As in other universities, throngs of students hurry in and out of the building, while others chat in on its arched balconies. The building was named after Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, who laid its foundations in 1904. Curzon Hall is an exquisite blend of European and Mughal architectural traditions and stands as one of the most beautiful buildings in Dhaka.","There is free access to the garden in which Curzon Hall is located. The back of the building, which is where the dormitories can be found, is also worth visiting."
48,Columbo Sahib’s Tomb,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",Hidden under the thick tropical vegetation of a cemetery is the tomb of Columbo Sahib.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/columbo-sahib-s-tomb,"This tomb consists of a square base surmounted by an octagonal structure. Including the cupola, the structure is about three-stories tall. Inside the square base are three off-center tombs. Although there are no epitaphs, it can be assumed they belonged to members of Columbo Sahib’s immediate family. It’s unclear where Columbo Sahib (aka Colombo Saheb) is buried. The tomb is a composite of different architectural styles. The lower structure resembles a Mughal mosque, with four openings, one on each side. The beautifully elaborate upper section exhibits gothic features, and the upper cupola has a baroque flavor. These different styles blend seamlessly and are further enhanced by the overgrown vegetation that has become an integral part of the structure. Although this interplay produces a romantic sense of decay and slow disintegration, the tomb has become structurally unstable. The beauty of this tomb did not escape Johan Zoffany’s eye. The German artist captured a snapshot of 18th-century Dhaka in the painting “Nagapan Ghat,” where Columbo Sahib’s Tomb is easily recognizable on the banks of a river. Of all the tombs in Dhaka Christian Cemetery, that of Columbo Sahib is by far the largest and most striking. It is therefore all the more puzzling that little is known about Columbo Sahib. Bishop Reginald Heber (1783-1826) attempted to uncover the identity of Columbo Sahib, but only managed to discover that this mysterious person worked for “Company ka nuokur.” Information that Heber never managed to confirm. The first record of Dhaka Christian Cemetery comes from 16th-century documents. It was first established for European traders, soldiers, and administrators in Dhaka. So, it’s not surprising that many tombs belong to prominent members of the East India Company.","Dhaka Christian Cemetery can be easily found along Narinda Road by the banner on its main gate, which is usually locked. A firm knock on the gate will usually attract the attention of the guardian, who will grant visitors access to the burial grounds."
49,Dahala Khagrabari,"Panchagarh, Bangladesh",A piece of India inside a piece of Bangladesh inside a piece of India inside a piece of Bangladesh.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dahalakhagrabari,"Dahala Khagrabari is a geopolitical anomaly. It’s a piece of India that until very recently was completely surrounded by a piece of Bangladesh, which itself was completely surrounded by India, which was again completely surrounded by Bangladesh. An enclave is a piece of one country’s territory which is entirely surrounded by another country’s territory, and the India-Bangladesh border was filled with them before 2015, when they were eliminated by a treaty between the two countries. A second-order enclave is an enclave inside an enclave, and the world has a handful of them. But in the history of the world there has only been one third-order enclave, an enclave inside of an enclave inside of an enclave. This is Dahala Khagrabari (#51), located in the Cooch Behar district of West Bengal, the border between India and Bangladesh. Just 2 acres in size, nobody ever lived inside this unique enclave, but it was owned by a Bangladeshi jute farmer who every morning, woke up in Bangladesh, walked over to India to farm his land, and returned home to Bangladesh at the end of the day. While some of the world’s most developed countries have at least one enclave and still function normally, the enclave situation of the India-Bangladesh border before 2015 was distinctly different. The border contained a whopping 198 enclaves, with over 50,000 people living in them. Since almost all of these enclaves were made up of farmland (and not cities), it can be inferred that tens of thousands of Indians and Bangladeshis had to regularly cross international borders just to acquire food, supplies and health care. But crossing one border is nothing compared to crossing two or three. If that same Bangladeshi jute farmer was working on the farm one day and wanted to walk to the nearest bus stop a half mile away, he would have to cross from his Indian farm into Bangladeshi territory, then cross back into India, and at last arrive back in another part of Bangladesh to reach the stop. That’s three border crossings in a half mile, just to board the bus in his home country. In an effort to fix this messy result of political border disputes, a July 2015 treaty eliminated all enclaves in India and Bangladesh by simply “erasing” all enclave border lines. Unfortunately, in many ways the border situation is just as chaotic as ever. Imagine living in an Indian enclave in Bangladesh, and suddenly hearing that, because of the treaty, you’re suddenly not living in India anymore, you’re living in Bangladesh. Right now many of the Indians and Bangladeshis who were previously living in enclaves are finding themselves in the wrong country. Update: This is no longer an enclave but part of Bangladesh since the 2015 treaty.",

While it is not the largest shipyard in the country (that honor belongs to the Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard), the Dhaka yard in the town of Keraniganj shares the seeming disregard for worker safety that can be found in simialr industrial sites around the country. The facilities, which employ around 15,000 workers at around $5 a day, work to both break down massive shipping vessels as well as create new ships from the parts. Workers can be seen torches and welding equipment to tears huge pieces of metal from the vessels, sans eye, hand, or face protection. Other workers will be found scaling the tall ships on ramshackle ladders or strolling along the high edges of the ship decks, the only thing to keep them from falling is their own balance. Injuries are common on the site, but the buzz of activity doesn’t stop. The ships being worked on are propped up on crude chalks creating the appearance that the river simply receded and left these hulks stranded on dry land. The space is tight so many of the boats are right up to small homes and other structures. This is clearly a worksite that is dangerous to its employees, and even more so to careless visitors. However local guides can be found who will assist anyone curious about the industrial dangers that still plague the world.","On the Buriganga River, opposite Sadarghat (boat terminal)Coordinates for this place of frenzy are 23.701981°, 90.409969°"
51,Armenian Church of Dhaka,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",All that is left of an Armenian community that thrived in Dhaka 200 years ago.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/armenian-church,"In the Armanitola district of Old Dhaka there is an unexpected sight: an Armenian Catholic church. Unbeknownst to many, there was a thriving Armenian population in Dhaka during the 17th and 18th centuries, and this 200-year-old church is all that’s left of that community. There is no record of when the first Armenians moved to Dhaka, but it was likely in the early 17th century, soon after the Persian Shāh Abbās conquered Armenia and deported 40,000 of its traders to Persia. Following this mass deportation, records of Armenian communities began appearing throughout the region. The move from Persia to Dhaka is not implausible considering that Persian was the official language in the Mughal Empire at the time. The textile business was booming and Armenians traded in jute, leather, and silk. Thanks to this industry, the community grew wealthy and in 1781 it commissioned the construction of a Catholic church, the Armenian Church of the Holy Resurrection. Measuring 75 feet in length, the white and yellow-trimmed church is rather small; the main hall can accommodate about 80 people. A fine painting depicting the Last Supper hangs on the wall, and a wooden spiral stair leads to the upstairs balcony, where another 20 or 30 people can find room. From there, two low, narrow openings give access to the roof. The lot on which the church was built was previously used as a cemetery by the Armenian community, and the churchyard is still an old burial ground where Armenian script is clearly visible on headstones. On one of the oldest graves is a skull and crossbones carving, indicating that the person was killed by pirates, in 1783. Service is no longer held on a regular basis, but on special occasions, such as Easter, a group of Catholic expats organizes a service in the historic church.","The gates to the Armenian church are usually closed, but knock or wait around a while, and someone will open them. There is no entrance fee, but a tip is expected."
52,Chittagong Ship-breaking Yards,"Bhatiari, Bangladesh",Where giant ships go to die.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chittagong-shipbreaking-yards,"Supertankers and giant cargo ships are the backbone of our global consumer society. Hundreds of meters long, ferrying millions of tons of goods across the globe, the sheer size of these immense vessels is awe inspiring. Construction of one such behemoth is a fascinating feat of engineering. However, the destruction and final resting place of these steel giants is even more intriguing. Even when such a ship is not seaworthy anymore, and repairs are not economically viable, the raw material it is constructed from has some value. Nowadays ship-breaking yards tend to be located in third world countries, places far out of sight of the consumers whose supermarkets they helped supply, and where labor is cheap and environmental protection laws are lax. There ships are chipped down bit by bit, usually by hand, and stripped of every last bit of value. Fauzdarhat, 20 kilometers northwest of Chittagong in Bangladesh, is where many of the world’s ships go to die. Over twenty ship-breaking yards dot the 16 miles of coastline. It is an industrial wasteland of epic proportions, where thousands of workers are forced to scratch their meager existence out of these hulking steel ruins, working with rudimentary protection, risking injury and illness, poisoned by toxic fumes and exposure to asbestos and other hazardous materials. Chittagong is but one of many such places. Gadani in Pakistan is perhaps even larger. Alang in Gujarat in India is another. Environmental groups such as Greenpeace have tried to raise awareness of the threat that these ship-breaking yards pose to both the people employed in them and to the environment. There is some hope that public pressure will force major shipping companies to make greater use of so called “Green Ship Recycling” facilities in developed countries.",Follow the N1 road north from Chittagong city.

It is one of 13 small monasteries, or “tiger lairs” where the Buddhist master Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rinpoche, is said to have meditated in the 8th century. Padmasambava, which translates as “he who came into being in a lotus,” was a Brahmin royal who spread Tantric Buddhism through Bhutan and Tibet in the 700s, and is seen in those areas as nearly as holy as the Buddha himself. As legend has it, Padmasambava landed at Paro Taktsang to meditate when he brought Buddhism to Bhutan in the 8th century. He is said to have arrived on a flying tiger which had recently been his Tibetan concubine. He then meditated in a cave high on the mountain for four months after which he subdued the local ‘demons’ and began the conversion of the Bhutanese to Buddhism. For those without flying tiger concubines, getting to the Tiger’s Nest is significantly more difficult. There is a two hour climb from the valley floor, which is already quite high at 7,000 feet, to the Tiger’s Nest 3,000 feet above— 10,000 feet above sea level. As one climbs the well-maintained but very steep trail over ever more vertical switchbacks, the monastery seems to appear and disappear in and out of the trees and the mists. After two hours of a long slow climb—going slow is recommended to help manage the pace of the altitude—one arrives at the only beginning of the entrance to the Tiger’s Nest, a rock outcropping overlooking a vast chasm, with the monastery on the other side. Beneath the promontory of rock, and across the chasm from the monastery, the cliff drops a couple of thousand feet to the gorge below. Carved into the exposed cliff face are stone steps; handrails have only recently been added. This is the way to the Tiger’s Nest monastery. Despite reservations that visitors may have about navigating the intimidating steps, it’s common to see Bhutanese locals, including mothers carrying small babies, walking up the steps with ease. The steps lead down into the gorge, which provides the separation and isolation the Tiger’s Nest has enjoyed for all these centuries. As one climbs into the canyon, a 100-meter high waterfall at the deep end of the canyon appears immediately in front, with the path traversing directly across its base. Once down and across the front of the water fall the steps start back up toward the Tiger’s Nest once again, over 700 steps in all. Visitors can enter Paro Taktsang (after removing their shoes) and climb the several levels within, which contain three temples and a spectacular view. High and deep inside is the site where Padmasambabva is said to have meditated for three years, three months, three weeks, three days and three hours. You can feel the chill breath coming from inside the cave. The return journey is much faster, but equally dramatic. In conjunction with the Long Now Foundation.

54,Dochula Pass Meditation Caves,"Dochula, Bhutan",The small sanctuaries lie just off the beaten path near one of Bhutan's most famous attractions.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dochula-pass-meditation-caves,"Dochula Pass is one of Bhutan’s most famous sites, perched at an altitude of 10,200 feet and located along the road from the country’s current capital of Thimphu to its former capital Punakha. A hidden surprise awaits the few who take the time to venture away from the touristy hub. These curious visitors will discover the meditation caves tucked into the hills just above the pass. At first resembling Hobbit homes, these tiny, open-faced caverns are built from stone and painted in colorful detail with Buddhist symbolism. The druk, or dragon—Bhutan’s long-time national symbol and spirit animal—stretches over the cave entrance, bringing good luck and good tidings. Meditation is a critical exercise for serious practitioners of Buddhism. To achieve enlightenment, monks and nuns will stay in one location, such as a meditation cave, for three days, three months, and three years. Each period is a trial for the next—if one can manage three days, one proceeds to three months. During this time, one may not speak with or cast eyes on another person. If you make it through three months, it’s time to take on three years. While you may not have three years to spare while visiting these caves, you’d be missing a hidden gem of Dochula Pass if you didn’t take the extra 10-minute climb into the forest to explore these carefully constructed meditative retreats that nearly blend into the hills. The short trek to the caves is a respite from the famous pass, which is home to 108 memorial chortens, or stupas, built in 2004 in honor of fallen Bhutanese soldiers killed in the battle against insurgents from India’s Assam region in 2003. Most visitors come to the pass for the magnificent views. On a clear day (which you’re lucky if you catch), you can take in Himalayan peaks including Mount Masanggang and Mount Gangkar Puensum, both over 22,000 feet tall.","There is a cafe just up the hill from the chortens. Head this way and continue upwards, following paths built from oval-shaped stone steps. As long as you continue following any of these paths, you'll soon encounter the meditation caves. If you continue farther, you'll discover an area strung with hundreds of worn prayer flags, and then a gate locked and decorated with barbed wire. Suffice it to say, time to turn back if you've made it this far."
55,Motithang Takin Preserve,"Thimphu, Bhutan","Strange, gentle beasts resembling goat-cow hybrids roam within this patch of forest.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/motithang-takin-preserve,"Strange muskox-looking creatures roam within the trees in Bhutan’s capital city. The hoofed beasts, which look like a mishmash of cows and goats, are held in extremely high esteem. The takin is a rare type of goat-antelope living in the Eastern Himalayas. The four subspecies of the takin live in high altitudes throughout Bhutan, Northeast India, Northwest Myanmar, and the Chinese section of the Himalaya. The odd-looking animals are the national animal of Bhutan. According to local legend, a 15th-century saint concocted the curious creature after he agreed to conjure up a miracle in exchange for lunch. He then slapped the head of a goat atop a cow’s skeleton and brought this new animal to life. In reality, the takin is the result of convergent evolution. The animals’ protracted noses, large heads, and sturdy torsos give them a distinctive look. Taxonomists, biologists, and zoologists are all keen to study the creature because though it resembles a muskox, it’s actually more genetically similar to sheep. The takin found at the Motithang Takin Preserve were once part of a small zoo. But when the King of Bhutan declared it was improper for Buddhist country to keep animals in such confinement, the big beasts were set free. Yet they didn’t wander far. The freed takin, which at this point were used to humans, preferred to converge within Thimphu. The Motithang Takin Preserve was created to provide shelter to the capital city’s four-legged residents. Now, the takin live within 8.4 acres of carefully managed forest. The Bhutanese authorities are particularly attentive to the health and wellbeing of the takin due to its status as the national animal. Other takin roam in the Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve in India. Surprisingly, you can also spot an actively breeding herd in Cumberland, Ohio, which was planted there as part of a Species Survival Plan.",
56,Buddha Dordenma Statue,"Thimphu, Bhutan","This giant Buddha statue has 125,000 smaller Buddhas hidden inside it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buddha-dordenma,"Atop a hill in Thimphu, the capital and largest city of Bhutan, is a massive, golden Buddha sitting atop a gilded meditation hall. But the monument holds an invisible secret: Unbeknownst to many people viewing the statue, they aren’t actually looking at one Buddha, they’re looking at 125,000 of them. Inside of Thimphu’s 169 foot Buddha Dordenma statue, there are 125,000 miniature Buddhas encapsulated inside of its enlightened bronze chest, ranging from 8 to 12 inches tall. This means that in Thimphu, which has a population of around 100,000, there are more Buddhas than there are human beings. Like the large Buddha, these thousands of miniature Buddhas are also gilded and made of bronze, a major reason that the statue cost almost $100 million to build when it was constructed in 2015 to honor the 60th birthday of Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the fourth king of Bhutan. The statue also fulfils two prophecies. The first, foreseen by yogi Sonam Sangpo, is that a Buddhist statue would be built in the region to “bestow blessings, peace, and happiness to the whole world.” In addition, the statue is said to have been mentioned by Guru Padmasambhava, widely referred to as the “second Buddha,” in the eighth century. This statue kills two birds with one stone by fulfilling both prophecies in glimmering fashion.",
57,Garden of Phallus (Wangchuk Chenmoi Dümra),"Thimphu, Bhutan",This garden is very fertile.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/garden-of-phallus-wangchuk-chenmoi-dumra,"Within the living museum of Simply Bhutan in the country’s capital of Thimphu, you’ll find a garden rather unique in its flora. Phalluses are not an uncommon sight in Bhutan. The symbol is meant to bring good luck, promote fertility and harmony, and ward off evil spirits. They’re painted in and on buildings, displayed on the headgear of Atsaras (masked clowns), and even used as scarecrows. A traditional housewarming ritual involves hoisting a basket of wooden phalluses onto the roof on the new home. The symbols date back to the 15th century, when the eccentric Buddhist teacher Drukpa Kunley, known as the “Divine Madman,” popularized the symbol when he brought Buddhism to Bhutan (showcased by his “penis-focused monastery,” Chimi Lhakhang). The Garden of Phallus is found in Simply Bhutan, a museum, restaurant, and photography studio built to resemble a Bhutanese village. Larger-than-life phallus statues mingle with plants in front of a mural which features several hanging smiling faces whose noses look an awful lot like, well, we’ll let you guess what they look like.",The garden is inside the Simply Bhutan museum and restaurant complex on Genyen Lam.
58,Punakha Suspension Bridge,"Punakha, Bhutan",This colorful overpass is one of Bhutan's longest suspension bridges.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/punakha-suspension-bridge,"The high mountains and deep gorges of Bhutan lend themselves to suspension bridges. Punakha Suspension Bridge, which is always adorned with colorful prayer flags, is the perfect example of this. Linking Punakha Dzong to Shengana, Samdingkha, and Wangkha villages across the Tsang Chu River (aka Po Chu), this is one of the longest suspension bridges in Bhutan. Yet, for a roughly 520-foot-long suspension bridge, it’s surprisingly stable. The bridge offers a spectacular view of the river and valley, and the east bank is a good starting point for multi-day treks in the nearby mountains. Traditional Bhutanese bridges make use of cantilevers, beams anchored to one bank and projecting horizontally to reach the other bank. This simple but effective structure can be upgraded by using interlocking beams. A prime example of this is the bridge in front of Punakha Dzong. Unlike these bridges, the one in Punakha relies on cables anchored to massive cement blocks on the banks. Being suspended, the bridge does have some inbuilt flexibility that makes it swing in strong winds, but not as much as you may expect. This is due to the stabilizing cables that taper off on both ends of the bridge. The deck is made of solid planks of wood nested in the deck truss.","Punakha Bridge is only about half a mile from Punakha Dzong, but it can easily be missed, as it’s not on the main road. To find it, head north from the dzong past the cremation grounds, following the Puna Tsang Chu River, either via rural roads on the west bank or via Trashigang-Semtokha Highway."
59,Trongsa Dzong,"Trongsa, Bhutan","The largest and, arguably, most scenic fortress in Bhutan.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trongsa-dzong,"Trongsa Dzong was first built in 1647, and it was from this dzong (fortress) that the first two Bhutanese kings ruled the country. The structure is strategically located on a steep slope commanding an extraordinary view of the Mangde River, approximately in the middle of the Kingdom of Bhutan. Narrow stone stairs, alleys, and corridors connect the buildings at all levels of the fortress, creating a veritable labyrinth on the slope. Within the walls of the dzong are 25 temples dedicated to Tantric deities, a watchtower (Ta Dzong) dating back to 1652, a printing shop producing religious texts following an ancient tradition, and a museum honoring the Wangchuck dynasty. In addition to its military importance, Trongsa Dzong was a major administrative and religious centre, still housing around 200 monks during the winter months. The historic fortress was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1897, and eventually restored in 1927 and 1999. It now annually hosts Trongsa Tsechu, a 5-day religious festival where traditional costumes and masks are deployed for the dances.  The date of the festival falls in December or January, in accordance with the Tibetan Lunar Calendar.",
60,Chimi Lhakhang,"Punakha, Bhutan","This penis-focused monastery is dedicated to Buddhism's ""Divine Madman.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chimi-lhakhang,"In general Buddhism is associated with serenity, peace, and beauty, and Bhutan’s Chimi Lhakhang monastery is no different, it just has a lot more penises. Also known as the “Fertility Temple,” the single building site was originally built in 1499 on a short hill that had been blessed by rogue Buddhist leader Drukpa Kunley, known as the “Divine Madman.” Drupa Kunley, also known as “The Saint of 5,000 Women” worked overtime to spread enlightenment through an active sex life. He was known to live a truly bacchanal lifestyle full of wine, women, and poetry. He is also credited with bringing Buddhism to Bhutan, hence the common phallic imagery found throughout the country. The phallus became Drupa Kunley’s symbol, signaling both fertility and the power to bring enlightenment to those who… learned from its teachings. Because of this, his penis as a symbol is sometimes known as the “Thunderbolt of Flaming Wisdom.” Drupa Kunley’s mad antics were a statement on the stuffiness of the Buddhist leaders at the time, but his exploits seemed to strike a chord with the locals, and illustrations of penises became a more common sight, said to be able to ward off evil spirits. This came from the legends that Drupa Kunley could bop demons on the head with his thunderbolt and turn them into protective spirits. In modern Bhutan, use of the penis as a symbol is frowned upon, as it might be any place in the world where wearing pants is the norm. But at Chimi Lhakang, the penises still adorn the walls of the nearby buildings, and wooden phalluses are still kept by the monks, used to bless women that seek to be blessed with children. Visitors from all over the world still travel to the monastery for a blessing of fertility.",
61,The Burning Lake,Bhutan,Legend has it a sacred treasure hidden by an ancient guru was revealed with a burning butter lamp from these waters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-burning-lake,"Though it’s known as Mebar Tsho, or “the Burning Lake,” this sacred site is not quite a lake at all, but rather a pool along a river in the Tang Valley. Local legend says that the water contained a hidden holy treasure uncovered through divination by one of Bhutan’s most important religious figures, Terton Pema Lingpa, in the late 1400s. Terton Pema Lingpa is thought to have been the reincarnation of Padmasambhava, an ancient guru also known as the Second Buddha. According to religious tradition, in the 8th century Padmasambhava hid secret teachings containing Buddhist wisdom for terton, treasure revealers like Pema Lingpa, to unearth in the future so his principles could live on. In the 15th century, Pema Lingpa had a vision that treasure was hidden in a pool where the Tang Chhu River widens. When the locals questioned the validity of his prediction, he submerged himself in the water holding a lit butter lamp, and resurfaced with a chest and a scroll, the lamp still aflame. Until that point, the pool had been referred to as Nya Ring Brag, translating to “Long-Nosed Cliff” for the cliff faces that surround the area. But from then on, this body of water assumed the name Mebar Tsho, or the Burning Lake. A conflicting hypothesis presents the slightly different narrative that the name Mebar Tscho actually references another treasure revealer by the name of Terton Sherab Mebar, who is also said to have uncovered treasure teachings from the lake. Still, the Burning Lake remains one of the region’s most sacred places and a pilgrimage site for many Bhutanese people. Colorful prayer flags fly around an altar dedicated to Terton Pema Lingpa, and butter lamps can be found scattered on the riverbanks as tribute.","The Burning Lake is a 30-minute drive from Chamkhar Town, located along the road to Ura or the Tang village in central Bhutan's Tang Valley. It takes about five minutes to walk from the road to the lake. The lake is accessible throughout the year at all times."
62,Gangteng Gompa,Bhutan,This 17th-century Bhutanese monastery is ensconced in Buddhist legend.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gangteng-gompa,"Gangteng Gompa is a historic monastery in the Black Mountain region of Bhutan. Built in the early 17th century, the monastery was established by Gyalse Rigdzin Pema Thinley, the grandson of the canonized Bhutanese “treasure revealer,” Pema Lingpa. Today, Gangteng Gompa is the largest Nyingmapa monastery in Western Bhutan. Buddhist mythology recalls the narrative of an ancient guru who hid terma (sacred treasures of Buddhist wisdom) for select terton (treasure finders) to reveal in the future when the time was right. The terma were hidden for their protection so that the terton could transmit Buddha’s teachings through the generations should his knowledge ever be lost or destroyed. Pema Lingpa, the grandfather of the monastery’s founder, was understood as an incarnation of that ancient guru. Following a series of revelations, he astoundingly unearthed over 100 terma across Bhutan in the mid-1470s. Rendered “King Terton,” Pema Lingpa made a pilgrimage to the imposing Black Mountain range, where he envisaged one of his descendants would build a monastery. Gangteng Gompa was established in 1613 by Pema Lingpa’s grandson on a spur in the Black Mountains called the Gangteng Sang Nga Chöling, which translates to “summit for the teaching of the dharma.” Local timber was used for the temple’s beams, doors, pillars, and windows. Delep, a guardian deity, supposedly created a landslide in the mountains for better access to stones. A team of community artisans embellished the space with exquisite technicolor detail. The monastery was restored between 2002 and 2008. Conservators worked to preserve the temple’s original detail with the addition of over 100 new pillars. Upon the temple’s completion, it was re-presented as Gangteng Sangngak Chöling, and consecrated by the ninth Gangteng Trulku, who is considered the current incarnation of Pema Lingpa.","On November 12 of each year, Gangteng Gompa hosts a Crane Festival to mark the annual arrival of black-necked cranes from the Tibetan plateau. Hundreds of cranes, which are sacred in the region, return to the monastery to roost, thought to bless the space by circling it three times."
63,Kyichu Lhakhang Temple,Bhutan,One of Bhutan's oldest temples was purportedly built to halt a giant female ogre from preventing the spread of Buddhism across Tibet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyichu-lhakhang-temple,"Kyichu Lhakhang (also called Lho Kyerchu and Kyerchu) is a majestic seventh-century temple revered as one of the most magnificent sites of worship in Bhutan. Located in the town of Paro, some sources reference the temple as one of the oldest in the nation; others name it the oldest. The original temple is said to have been built overnight on the left foot of a colossal ogress—otherwise referred to as a demoness—who intercepted the spread of Buddhism as she lay across the land. It’s thought to be one of over 100 temples established to overpower her so Buddhism could flourish far and wide. Kyichu Lhakhang is believed to have been a smaller structure when the Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo erected this sacred building in the year 659, but a number of Buddhist saints and gurus added to the site until it became the spectacular temple it is today. Legend has it that the Second Buddha, Padmasambhava, was one of the important historical figures who paid pilgrimage to Kyichu Lhakhang in the eighth century, and that he hid treasure teachings around the temple. The building underwent a round of renovations in the 1830s, and in 1968, the Royal Queen Mother Ashi Kezang Choden Wangchuck ordered its expansion in the way of Guru Lhakhang: a neighboring chapel that houses statues of Padmasambhava and Kurukulla, a female lotus deity, clutching a bow and an arrow made of flowers. Beyond the exquisite gilded door to the main temple of Jowo Lhakhang is an original statue of Jowo Jamba (also Jowo Shakyamuni or Jowo Rinpoche) forged in the seventh century. His likeness constitutes the most sacred sculpture in the region, and the wooden planks on the floor in front of him manifest the wear and tear of centuries of worship at his feet. Nearby, a statue of Chenrezig, an all-knowing deity said to embody the compassion of all the Buddhas, bears 11 heads and 1,000 arms. The cloisters that fortify the temple foster a contemplative space populated by fruit trees and prayer wheels, which monks spin quietly as they circulate the space. The inner courtyard conceals a mural portraying King Gesar of Ling, a warrior who is said to have conjured the longest poem in history.","Kyichu Lhakhang is a 10-minute drive from Paro proper. Visitors are welcome between 9 a.m. and noon, and 1 p.m. until 5 p.m."
64,Drukgyel Dzong,"Paro, Bhutan",The ruins of an abandoned 17th-century fort that was almost completely destroyed by a fire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drukgyel-dzong,"For much of human history, the land that makes up modern Bhutan was recognized as the territory of Tibet. It was not until the early-to-mid-17th century, when Bhutan and Tibet went to war and Drukgyel Dzong was built, that things began to change. In 1634, a Tibetan refugee by the name of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal rose to power in Bhutan and led an army to victory over Tibet in the Battle of Five Lamas. Through this war the Bhutanese state was effectively born, and Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal became its first ruler. The fighting did not stop there, however, as waves of Tibetan or Mongol-Tibetan invasions continued in the following decades, trying to regain control of the Bhutanese land. It was during these tumultuous times that the dzong (fortresses) were being strategically placed along the main routes linking Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, to the villages of Bhutan. Drukgyel Dzong was built in 1649 near Paro, in Bhutan, to repel the Tibetan invasions. The name Drukgyel refers to “Druk,” the royal dynasty at the time and the name of the country in its local vernacular, and “gyel,” meaning “victory” or “victorious.” When the invasions finally ended, Drukgyel Dzong became an important stop for traders. Rice was the main export to Tibet, and salt and tea were the main goods imported from Tibet, and caravans would stop by Drukgyel Dzong before tackling the Tremo La pass. The Drukgyel Dzong structure consists of a tall central building and an adjacent courtyard surrounded by lower buildings. The fort takes full advantage of the terrain. It’s located on top of a hill with steep cliffs on three sides, leaving only one side of the structure vulnerable to attack. A fortified wall with several derelict watchtowers surrounds it. There used to be tunnels connecting the dzong with the river to decrease the risk of fetching water during battle, but these tunnels are now sealed. In 1951, Drukgyel Dzong was almost completely destroyed by a fire, and what remained was left to the elements until restoration work began in 2016.","It's located on the upper the Paro Valley, about 8.7 miles from Paro, and is easily accessible by car."
65,Khamsum Yulley Namgyal Chorten,Bhutan,A stupa built to protect Bhutan from evil forces and help bring peace to the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khamsum-yulley-namgyal-chorten,"Built in 2004 by the Queen of Bhutan, Khamsum Yulley Namgyal is a chorten, or stupa, overlooking the Punakha Valley. It was built with a specific function in mind: to ward off evil spirits in Bhutan and across the world, and to bring peace and harmony to all living things. Despite its relatively recent construction, Khamsum Yulley Namgyal was built in strict accordance with traditional teachings. It took Bhutanese carpenters, painters and sculptors nine years to build the four-story, pagoda-style stupa, as well as the various smaller pagodas surrounding it, some of which contain prayer wheels. Khamsum Yulley Namgyal was built with a very specific intention in mind. Rather than being a place of communal worship, a monastic retreat or a place of education, it was built to provide spiritual protection, peace and harmony. As such, the chorten is largely focused on wrathful deities, a concept that may seem counterintuitive. As you walk in to the main room on the first floor of Khamsum Yulley Namgyal, for example, you’ll come face to face with a 15-feet-tall statue of Vajrakilaya, one of the eight deities of Kagyé. And while considered a powerful and wrathful deity, Vajrakilaya’s fury is directed at destroying forces hostile to compassion, purifying their power to do damage. Statues and shrines to these wrathful deities are also found on the second and third floors, each offering protection against the forces of evil in the world. And to balance the wrathful force of these deities are a series of yab-yum figures on the walls. Each of these figures depicts a male deity in union with his female consort, representing the union of wisdom and compassion. Finally, as you reach the final rooftop floor, you’ll see a golden statue of Sakyamuni Buddha in his classic pose. The serene statue looks to the south, surveying the spectacular view out across the Punakha Valley.","Khamsum Yulley Namgyal is located in the Punakha District of Bhutan, about 17 miles northeast (as the crow flies) of Thimphu, the largest city and capital of Bhutan. From the town of Punakha, it’s about a one-hour hike along a trail that crosses a suspension bridge and then goes up the hill to the chorten. Khamsum Yulley Namgyal is open to visitors every day of the year, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m."

Conversely, the tiny airstrip situated a mile and a half above sea level has also been described as completely terrifying and is roundly regarded as one of the most challenging airports to land in the world. Coming out of the clouds toward Paro Airport, you are likely to see 18,000 foot peaks of the Himalayas on one or both sides of you. At 6,500 feet long, the runway at Paro is actually shorter than its elevation, and few pilots are even certified to fly into the Himalayan valley. Besides the danger of flying through some of the world’s tallest peaks, the runway is carved out of the mountain foliage, and pilots must also account for vicious winds that sweep through the valley. Despite the challenges associated with the airport, the eight pilots that are certified to land at the airport still manage to bring over 30,000 people per year into the mountainous Asian country.",
67,Ogyen Choling Palace and Museum,"Tang Valley, Bhutan",This Bhutanese site is one of eight sacred locales established by a revered 14th-century Buddhist master.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ogyen-choling-palace-and-museum,"Crowned by a 19th-century manor house, Ogyen Choling is the former residence of a ruling family descended from a 14th-century Buddhist teacher. The building, which has since been converted into a museum to promote its conservation and to drive tourism to the village, was largely destroyed following an earthquake in the late 1800s. The residential quarters, the main temple, and the tower were all rebuilt, and the site continues to beckon visitors and religious pilgrims alike. The origins of Ogyen Choling began with a visit to the remote Tang Valley by the illustrious philosopher of ancient Nyingmapa Buddhism, Longchen Rabjam (1308-1363), some seven centuries ago. He allegedly chose the site for the elephant’s head-shaped vista created by the Tang valley and the neighboring Kanyai mountain. In Buddhist mythology, the elephant symbolizes longevity. According to legend, a cave located towards the top of the elephant’s head served as Longchen Rabjam’s place of meditation, and so Ogyen Choling assumed sacred connotations. The site would subsequently attract a legendary terton (a Buddhist treasure seeker endowed with the ability to reveal Buddhist revelations in the way of ancient texts or religious objects that manifest when the need arises) by the name of Dorji Lingpa (1346-1405), who was also an esteemed master of the Nyingmapa school of Buddhism. Throughout the years, Ogyen Choling maintained a strong connection to Dorji Lingpa’s presence there—notably through Tsokye Dorji, the 15th descendant of Dorji Lingpa, who built the palace where Dorji Lingpa’s monastery was in the mid-19th century. According to Kuensel Online, the community surrounding Ogyen Choling was once expected to contribute to the palace’s upkeep by the law of former Bhutanese social order, but come the 1950s when serfdom dissolved, the family had to maintain the rapidly crumbling palace on their own. In an effort to save it and generate revenue for the surrounding village, the house was converted into Bhutan’s first private museum in 2001, which is now completely owned and overseen by the Ogyen Choling Foundation. The palace remains a sacred point of interest for Tibetan Buddhists, but under the Ogyen Choling Foundation’s care, the building also provides a fascinating insight into historical Bhutanese life. Parts of the house have been recreated to give visitors a clear sense of how they would have looked over the last 200 years, and artworks and artifacts have been conserved for their exhibition. While the innermost rooms are lit with electricity, the Foundation’s aim is to present the building as accurately as possible. The main temple was reconstructed from 1898 to 1899 after a destructive earthquake disrupted the grounds in 1897. On-site shrines honor sacred Buddhist figures including Dorji Lingpa, who founded the Ogyen Choling line, and Mahakala, a deity enlisted to protect the village. Note that the Mahakala shrine is reserved exclusively for locals, and visitors are strictly prohibited from entering. That said, some 20 exhibitions illuminating Bhutanese art and traditional craft, a way of life, ritual performances, and more are sure to keep tourists busy.","Visitors are advised to tour the museum between 9 am and 2 pm when the natural light is at its brightest. In 2016, the Ogyen Choling Heritage House opened as a guest house component for overnight stays. The Heritage House offers 14 guest rooms across three buildings, each individually designed to stay true to the aesthetic origins of the site. Patrons are instructed to email olinghh@gmail.com or wrjakar@gmx.ch to book."
68,Chendebji Chorten,"Trongsa, Bhutan",An 18th-century Nepali-style chorten built to subdue demons and evil spirits.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chendebji-chorten,"Sitting in a verdant valley, Chendebji Chorten was built in the 18th century by the Buddhist Lama Ngesup Tshering Wangchuk to ward off evil spirits and demons. Unusually for Bhutan, this chorten—a shrine to an important Buddhist monk—is styled after Bouddhanath Stupa in Nepal, including the signature eyes looking at the four cardinal points. Fitting with the tradition, there is a relic inside the chorten. In this case, it is the skull of Tenzin Lekpai Dhundrup, a powerful figure believed to be the reincarnated guardian of Tibetan Buddhist teachings. Next to the chorten is a long prayer wall adorned with holy Buddhist scriptures. Chendebji Chorten attracts a large number of pilgrims during Sambha Lhundrup Molam Chenmo, a festival held during the ninth month of the Bhutanese calendar, during which devout Buddhists make their wish prayers. Several legends surround Chendebji Chorten. One of these is that the chorten was laid on top of an evil spirit in the form of a giant snake, which was squashed and defeated. Another legend maintains the monument was placed in the exact spot where the three edges of the sky meet. Yet another claims the chorten was built to subdue a demoness that used to torment the area. These legends are not perceived as incompatible, but mutually reinforcing, all pointing at the supernatural significance of this holy site.","Traveling from Thimphu, Chendebji Chorten is located 25 miles before reaching Trongsa.

Supposedly one of a series of temples built to tame a demoness, today it hosts the Jambay Lhakhang Drup festival, during which the sacred Tercham, or Naked Dance, takes place. In 659 AD, the Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo had a serious problem in his realm. A supine demoness lay across the Himalayas, causing the region to pour forth savagery and malign forces. The king’s attempts to introduce Buddhism to the country were sure to fail should this demoness remain, and the very prospect of civilization in Tibet was under threat. To combat this evil, Songtsen Gampo built a series of temples throughout the Himalayas, each one helping to pin down the demoness. Four were built to pin down her shoulders and hips; four more on the elbows and knees; and four to hold down her hands and feet. Later histories expand this already colorful legend even further, telling of how the king built 108 temples to defeat the demoness, all of which were built in a single day. According to these legends, the temple of Jambay Lhakhang in the Bumthang District of Bhutan was built to pin down the left knee of the demoness. And with Jambay Lhakhang and the other temples in place, the demoness was pinned to the earth forever, allowing the king to rid the land of evil and introduce Buddhism to Tibet. Of the 108 temples supposedly built to defeat the demoness, only a handful remain. These include Jambay Lhakhang, one of the oldest and most sacred temples in the Kingdom of Bhutan. Today, the one-story temple complex, which sits on a plateau by the Bumthang Chhu River, is just as famous for its fanciful history as it is for its annual festival. The Jambay Lhakhang Drup festival is held each year to commemorate the building of the temple and to honor Guru Rimpoche (Padmasambhava), an 8th-century Buddhist master who consecrated the Jambay Lhakhang temple. The four-day festival features many different dances, but two are considered particularly sacred. The first is the Mewang, or Fire Dance, which is held in the evening to bless infertile women in the hope that they may later bear children. The second is the Tercham, or Naked Dance, during which sixteen men dance around the temple, all completely naked, on the stroke of midnight. Why? Well, it apparently dates back to the 8th century, when a band of devils was causing havoc in the area. To distract the devils, the local men performed a naked dance, their unclothed antics leaving the devils spellbound and rendering them harmless. Far less messy than an exorcism.","Jambay Lhakhang is located in Bumthang (also known as Jakar) in the central-eastern region of Bhutan, about 68 miles east of the capital Thimphu. You can visit the temple any time of the year. The Jambay Lhakhang Drup festival takes place every year, but the date varies. In 2018 it began on October 24, and is set to start on November 13 in 2019. And no, you’re not allowed to take photos of the naked dancers."
70,Gangkhar Puensum,"Gangkhar Puensum, Bhutan",The tallest unclimbed mountain in the world remains poorly charted out of respect for local spirits.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gangkhar-puensum,"While the distinction is a contentious one for a number of reasons (what is the “top” of a mountain, what constitutes a mountain), the honor of world’s highest unclimbed peak is generally agreed to belong to Bhutan’s Gangkhar Puensum, where climbing is actually prohibited. In the Syfy original film, Killer Mountain, Gangkhar Puensum and its mysterious peak hide a murderous alien presence, which, while fantastical, is not far from the actual reason the mountain remains unexplored. Ever since 1994, Bhutan has expressly prohibited climbing on the mountain due not only to the lack of available rescue services in the area, but mainly because of a local custom which held the peaks sacred as they were the homes of holy spirits. At almost 10,000 feet tall from base to summit, Gangkhar Puensum is the highest mountain in Bhutan where the bulk of the prominence rests. However some of the mountain extends into Chinese territory which led to the only attempted climb to the summit. In 1998, a Japanese climbing team set out to explore the uncharted mountain from the Chinese side, but were stopped by political outrage from Bhutan. To this day, Gangkhar Puensum has yet to be successfully mounted and remains one of the precious unexplored areas in an increasingly filled in map of the world. Its a great reminder that there are still countless places of mystery in the world.",

Weaving is a fundamental component of Bhutanese culture, thus the Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan was established at the behest of Her Majesty Gyalyum (Queen Mother) Sangay Choden Wangchuck as a nonprofit institution in 2005. The academy serves as an educational space by which trainees learn weaving traditions and techniques, how to dye their yarn, and basic business practices such as bookkeeping. It’s also a conservation center used to restore precious artifacts from monasteries all over Bhutan, and a museum that hosts a rotating program of exhibitions relating to the textile arts. Since its inception, the Royal Textile Academy has since expanded to include offices and partnered with the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage to further the organization’s mission to preserve this vital element of Bhutanese art and history.","The Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan is open from 9am-4pm, Monday through Saturday."
72,Kampong Ayer,"Kampung Lupak Luas, Brunei","Ferdinand Magellan dubbed the world's largest water village the ""Venice of the East.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kampong-ayer-bandar-seri-begawan-brunei,"For 1,300 years, people have inhabited the stilted water village of Kampong Ayer. Since that time, it has been dubbed the “Venice of the East,” but in many ways, its bizarre water structures are in a league of their own. Today, Kampong Ayer is not only still standing, it is blossoming. More than 30,000 people live in the city, bringing the total population to 10 percent of the entire country of Brunei. Although it’s classified as one village, it’s actually a cluster of 42 smaller villages, interconnected by 18 miles of footbridges. The buildings sit atop stilts on the water’s surface, and the village has electricity and even air conditioning. Kampong Ayer connects Brunei to its past, as people in the area have been living on and off the water throughout its history. According to many accounts, Magellan visited the village in the 16th century, and is credited with coining the phrase “Venice of the East.” Even though many of the structures seem small, the village is also equipped with hospitals, schools, shops, and restaurants.",Wooden speedboat water taxis ferry passengers between distant points across the village. The water taxis often depart in front of the Yayasan Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah in Bandar Seri Begawan.
73,Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei",A symbol of Islam in oil-rich Brunei.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sultan-omar-ali-saifuddin-mosque,"Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque is a an exclamation point above the Brunei River, and the so-called village in the water, Kampong Ayer. Built on an artificial lagoon on the banks of the river, the mosque initially seems more attraction than place of worship. However, this could not be farthest from the truth, and the grandiose mosque was in fact designed solely for prayer to Allah. From around Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei, the golden topped dome of the mosque shines in the night sky. Although its population is only 400,000, 2/3 of the population of Brunei adhere to Islam, laws are based on Sharia. The country is extremely proud of its Muslim population, and the golden mosque was built to honor this section of the country. At a cost of around 5 million USD, the Bruneian Sultan spared no expense: imported Italian marble pillars and floor, granite from Shanghai, crystal chandeliers from England, ornate carpets from Saudi Arabia and a main dome of pure gold. Although the flashy exterior of the mosque and the ceremonial boat in its personal lagoon appear almost gimmicky in their seeming desire to draw in tourists, the mosque’s true purpose becomes clear when visitors realize they cannot enter the mosque, except in prayer. Despite the bar to entry for non-Muslims, the mosque is still one of the most beautiful structures in the country and declared by most to be the most beautiful and fantastic mosque in Southeast Asia.",
74,Sumbiling Eco Village,"Batang Duri, Brunei",A remote lodge nestled among some of the world's best-preserved rainforests.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sumbiling-eco-village,"Making up only 1 percent of the island of Borneo and with less than 500,000 residents, Brunei is often overshadowed by its much larger island neighbors, Malaysia and Indonesia. Ignoring tiny Brunei comes at a cost, however, as the slim nation contains some of the world’s oldest rainforests. The rainforests of Brunei have been largely preserved thanks to a strict “no cut” policy the government implemented in the 1990s to combat deforestation. As a result, ancient tropical rainforests span more than 70 percent of Brunei’s terrain, and ecotourism has become a new focus for the nation as it attempts to diversify its extremely oil-dependent economy. Just minutes from Ulu Temburong National Park—the country’s first national park, regularly referred to as the “Green Jewel of Brunei”—the Sumbiling Eco Village capitalizes on these long-term preservation efforts and has become one of the country’s premier eco-destinations. Sumbiling is managed in conjunction with the local Iban community, located on the banks of the Sungai Temburong River. It allows visitors a chance to explore the lush, green jungles that have come to define life in this wildly untouched slice of Borneo.","Sumbling Eco Village is located in Brunei's Temburong District, an exclave separated by Malaysia and Brunei Bay. As a result, the best way to reach the district (and avoid four overland immigration checkpoints) is by taking the speed boat from Bandar Seri Begawan and Bangar, which makes the run regularly from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. One way fares are $6 and the journey takes 45 minutes."
75,Istana Nurul Iman,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei",1800 rooms of single-family residence in Brunei.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/istana-nurul-iman,"Named the Palace of the Faith Light, this $1.4 billion home in Brunei seems to display more opulence than spirituality. Completed in 1984, the extravagant Istana Nurul Iman is the largest palace in the world, and is occupied by only one family. Dripping in oil wealth, the palace was commissioned by the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, and every detail of the place is grandiose and over-the-top. Covering 2,000,000 square feet, the palace features everything one would expect; 1,800 rooms, a 110 car garage, and of course, an air-conditioned stable for the Sultan’s horses. So as not to get too far from the idea of Faith Light, the palace also includes its own mosque that can accommodate 1,500 worshippers. Besides being the sultan’s home, he also entertains foreign dignitaries at the palace, and several government offices are also on site. Despite these practical uses, the palace is still very much a home for the sultan and houses part of his 5,000 car collection including custom made Bentleys and hundreds of Ferraris and Rolls Royces. Although it is a private residence, the sultan invites the masses in for three days a year during Hari Raya Aidilfitri. An estimated 110,000 come every year to gawk at the riches of the sultan, and receive a gift from his eminence; small packets containing money.",
76,The Royal Regalia Museum,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei",A well kept and well documented look at the Bruneian Sultan's life and successes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/royal-regalia-museum-bandar-seri-begawan,"Sitting just up the street from Bandar Seri Begawan’s main intersection sits the Royal Regalia Building, a building which in its splendor lies a vast collection of discarded relics and monuments to the current Sultan of Brunei, His Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu‘izzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan dan Yang Di-Pertuan Negara Brunei Darussalam. In true cult of personality style, the building – truthfully, more of a museum – houses exhibits to illustrate the important up bringing, education, marriage, travels, coronation and subsequent rule of the current Bruneian head of state. Entrance to the museum is, quite enticingly free of charge. Inside, all belongings, including cameras must be left at the counter in order to enter and enjoy the chronology of the Sultan’s life. There are replicas of His throne, various crowns, gowns, weapons and splendid examples of tributes offered to the Sultan. Gifts of elaborate crystal, jade, ivory, and silver, to name a few, serve to remind visitors of the Sultan’s inscrutable wealth. It leaves one to wonder: if such precious offerings do not even make it on a shelf of his palace, the largest personal residence in the world, how rich is this man? The most interesting sections are the life sized replica of the Sultan’s silver jubilee in 1992 and a small room which houses the many decorations to his military service. His silver jubilee is documented with a to scale model of his parade float with scores of uniformed mannequins encompassing it to represent his honour guard In another room, well over twenty different countries’ military honors and decorations exemplify the Sultan’s apparent military prowess. As one of Bandar Seri Segawan’s main attractions, the museum usually pulls in most visitors to the city. With scarce else to do in an astonishingly quiet capital city, if one is in Brunei, a stop at the Royal Regalia Building is necessary to comprehend the absolute monarchy that rules in the tiny sultanate (if not only to beat the oppressive heat).",If you find Jalan Sultan (Sultan Street) you'll find the Museum. Head in the direction away from the water.
77,Billionth Barrel Monument,"Seria, Brunei",A monument built to commemorate the billionth barrel of oil extracted from the Seria oil field in Brunei.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/billionth-barrel-monument,"The Billionth Barrel Monument was commissioned by the Brunei Shell Petroleum Company in 1991. As the name suggests, it commemorates the billionth barrel of crude oil produced at the Seria field. The monument was erected close to the site of the first well discovered in Brunei in 1929. Its six arches, which join at the top, represent both the flow of oil from beneath the ground to the surface, as well as the number of decades of oil exploration and production that led to the billionth barrel. Atop the monument sits the national emblem of Brunei, representing the prosperity of the nation and its people. Leading up to the monument is a series of copper panels depicting various scenes from Brunei’s oil industry. And once you’ve had a look at these and the monument itself, you can take a stroll along the nearby beach. From here, you can look out to sea to the oil rigs in the distance, working tirelessly to produce the Sultan’s next billion barrels. The Billionth Barrel Monument was unveiled on July 18, 1991, by Hassanal Bolkiah, the 29th and current Sultan (and Prime Minister) of Brunei. The Sultan, whose full name is—wait for it —Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien Sultan and Yang di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, is also one of the world’s few remaining absolute monarchs. Thanks in large part to the highly productive Seria field, Hassanal Bolkiah also ranks among the wealthiest individuals in the world. You may have heard about him in the news in 2019, after he spearheaded legislation to make homosexuality and adultery punishable by death by stoning.","The Billionth Barrel Monument is located along the beach and just off Jln Tengah Street in the town of Seria on the coast of Brunei. From Bandar Seri Begawan (the capital of Brunei), you can take a bus to Seria and then a taxi to the monument, or rent a car in the capital and drive. The monument is always open, and sunset is the most popular time for visiting. Entrance is free."
