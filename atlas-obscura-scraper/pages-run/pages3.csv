0,The Lost City of Heracleion,"Alexandria, Egypt",An ancient city exhumed from the depths of the ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lost-city-of-heracleion-al-maadeyah-egypt,"It was barely more than a legend. Appearing in a few rare inscriptions and ancient texts, the city of Thonis-Heracleion was hidden away for thousands of years, submerged deep under the sea. After searching for years by screening the vast area of the Abu Qir Bay off the coast of Egypt, French archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team saw a colossal face emerge from the watery shadows. Goddio had finally encountered Thonis-Heracleion, completely submerged 6.5 kilometres off Alexandria’s coast. Among the underwater ruins were 64 ships, 700 anchors, a treasure trove of gold coins, statues standing at 16 feet, and most notably the remains of a massive temple to the god Amun-Gereb, and the tiny sarcophagi for the animals that were brought there as offerings. The ruins and artifacts made from granite and diorite are remarkably preserved, and give a glimpse into what was, 2300 years ago, one of the great port cities of the world. The harbor of Thonis-Heracleion (the Egyptian and Greek names of the city) controlled all the trade into Egypt. Built around its grand temple, the city was criss-crossed with a network of canals, a kind of ancient Egyptian Venice, and its islands were home to small sanctuaries and homes. Once a grand city, today its history is largely obscured and no one is quite sure how it ended up entirely underwater. To learn more visit: www.franckgoddio.org",
1,Nilometer,"Cairo, Egypt",An ancient instrument used to measure the waters of the Nile so Egyptian farmers would know whether to expect famine or flood.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nilometer,"In ancient Egypt, the behavior of the Nile could mean life or death each harvest season. So, long before the Aswan Dam was constructed to manage the flooding of the great river, Egyptians invented an instrument to measure the waters in order to predict the Nile’s behavior: the nilometer. There were three kinds of nilometers, and examples of all three can still be seen around Egypt. The simplest was a tall column housed in a submerged stone structure called a stilling well. One of these nilometers can be seen on Rhoda (or Rawda) Island in Cairo, an octagonal marble column held in place by a wooden beam at the top that spans the width of the well. The stilling well included a staircase so that priests, who were in charge of monitoring the nilometers, could walk down and examine the column. Nilometers were used for measuring water levels as early as 5,000 years ago. The nilometer on Rhoda Island dates back to 861, when it was built where an older nilometer had been, based on a design by Afraganus, a famous astronomer. The massive measuring stick had markings on it to indicate where the water level was at any given time, information the priests would use to determine what conditions the future held: drought, which would mean famine; desirable, which would mean just enough overflow to leave good soil for farming; or flood, which could be catastrophic. Only priests and rulers, whether pharaohs or later, Roman or Arab leaders, were allowed to monitor the nilometers, and their ability to predict the behavior of the Nile was used to impress the common people. (And to determine how much money would be collected in taxes.) This is why so many nilometers were built in temples, where only priests would be able to access the mysterious instrument. The nilometer on Rhoda Island is today housed in a modernized building. The conical roof replaced an older dome that was destroyed in 1825 during the French occupation. The interior is ornately carved, and three tunnels that once let water into the stilling well at different levels have been filled in, so visitors can walk all the way down. Another type of nilometer, like the one that can be seen on Elephantine Island in Aswan, had evenly spaced steps that lead straight down to the Nile, and indicator markings on the walls at different levels for each step. This one was often the first to indicate what conditions to expect, being located near Egypt’s southern border. The third kind, an example of which can be seen at Temple of Kom Ombo, a little further north, brought the water away from the Nile by way of a canal that deposited it into a cistern. And again, the indicating markers were carved into the wall, accessible by staircases for the priests and rulers who predicted the fate of the Egyptian crop.",
2,The Temple of Abu Simbel,"Nubia, Egypt",Ozymandias’ time-keeping temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-temple-of-abu-simbel-egypt-nubia-egypt,"The Great Temple of Abu Simbel was completed in 1244 BCE. It is one of the crowning monuments of Rameses the Great, the pharaoh who would become the model for Percy Shelley’s poem “Ozymandias”: “My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: / Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” At Abu Simbel, four colossal statues of Rameses, each 20 meters high, look down upon the desert. But the temple’s greatest secret lies at its heart. It was built along the axis of the sun, so that twice a year, light would flood into its innermost sanctum. The temple was moved wholesale in the 1960s to accommodate the Aswan High Dam, but its uncanny architecture still functions today. On February 22 and October 22 each year, you may still see the sunlight reach the innermost room of Rameses’ time-keeping temple, as it did over three thousand years ago. There, the sun illuminates three of the four statues waiting there: Ra, Amun, and Rameses himself. Only the fourth statue, of Ptah, the mysterious creator-god, is left in shadow. UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention was created, in fact, to preserve Abu Simbel. After the Nasser Dam was built, the temple was briefly submerged underwater. A large effort saw it carried out and rebuilt, piece by piece, the large mountain it was carved into included.",
3,City of the Dead,"El-Saf, Egypt",An endless sea of white conical domes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-of-the-dead,"Just outside the central Egyptian city of Minya lies the cemetery Zawiyyet al-Mayyiteen. Dubbed the “City of the Dead,” it is considered one of the world’s largest cemeteries. It is a truly huge necropolis, but more significant than its size is its thought-provoking beauty. Comprised of innumerable white conical domes, that stretch out across a wide plain, the necropolis appears similar to waves in the sea. Each of the several hundred mud-brick mausolea of the necropolis is topped with a dome. The cemetery stretches for several kilometers and was used by Muslims and Coptic Christians alike. A couple of rock-cut tombs from the Old Kingdom are found at the edge of the site, as well as a small step pyramid from the early 3rd dynasty. The pyramid is remarkable because it is the only pyramid built on the eastern bank of the Nile. The necropolis is particularly stunning at sunrise and sunset. However, visitors should be aware that this is a working cemetery and should be respectful and modestly dressed.",7 km southeast of Minya; Minya Governorate; Egypt
4,Hathor Temple,"Dandarah, Egypt",One of the most well-preserved temples of ancient Egypt.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hathor-temple,"If you’ve heard about the Dendera Light Bulb and want to see the famed relief up close and personal, you will have to visit the underground crypt of Hathor Temple at the Dendera Temple Complex in Qena, Egypt. If you’re looking for a jaw-dropping experience, the beautifully intricate, 2,000-year-old temple is not to be missed. The Temple of Hathor is one of the most well-preserved temples in all of Egypt. There are three temples to view in the complex: the birthing temple at the front, the temple of Isis behind the main temple, and the main temple dedicated to Hathor. There is also a sacred pool that you can still explore. It’s empty though; sorry, no swimming. The colors seen throughout the temples are original, and amazingly vibrant considering the inside was once covered in soot from Bedouins and other desert peoples seeking asylum. They would use the temples as shelter, lighting fires for cooking and warmth. Since the temple complex used to be covered halfway in desert sand, it was easy for the soot to accumulate at the top. To show the amount of soot that had to be cleaned, archaeologists chose strips of ceiling in each temple to leave covered in soot as a comparison. The clearing of soot and all the sand burying the temples was tedious work that took years to complete. The temple complex displays influences from Egyptian, Greek, and Roman rulers. There was also a Coptic Christian church on the premises near the birthing temple at one point. The main temple was built by Ptolemy XII and nearly completed by Queen Cleopatra VII, around 54 to 20 BCE. There is evidence of temples and other structures that date back all the way to 2500 BCE. Hathor is the Egyptian sky goddess of sexual love, fertility, music, and dancing. It is also said she is the goddess of birth and motherhood. She is often depicted as the counterpart of Horus. In fact, Hathor translates to “House of Horus.” Inside the underground crypt, on the same relief wall as the famed Dendera light bulb (just to the right of it) is the most detailed depiction of Horus discovered to date. Getting to the crypt requires you to crawl on your hands and knees for a stint. Well, maybe not crawl, but entrance requires going down a steep staircase, turning around, getting on your knees and backing through so you don’t hit your head. If you are short, it helps. The temple is a wondrous marvel to explore. Each of the rooms is as intricately decorated as the Great Vestibule, the front room at the main entrance fronted by 24 columns. The ceiling in the Great Vestibule is a tribute to Nut (Newt), Goddess of the Sky. Beyond are antechambers with crypts, chapel rooms, and a sanctuary. There is a corridor on each side of the second antechamber. The corridor to climb to the top of the temple is a spiral, just as a bird would ascend, while the corridor to leave the roof is a straight path down, just as a bird would dive. This is a tribute to Horus. At the top of the structure, there is a small temple that was used for rituals to greet the rising sun, as well as another antechamber, called the Chapel of Osiris. Inside this chapel, one of the rooms holds a unique ceiling relief, called the Dendera Zodiac. It is considered the only complete “map” of the ancient Egyptian sky. The one at Hathor Temple is a replica, however. The real Dendera Zodiac is on display at the Louvre in Paris, France. The birthing temple is also intricately decorated, and reliefs on the side depict the births of gods and Egyptian pharaohs. It is positioned at the front of the complex, across from a display of former statues and partial column pieces found during excavation. The Temple of the Goddess Isis is situated behind the main temple near the sacred pool. It is small and not as decorative, but still worth a look.","Some things to know if planning a visit to the Dendera (also spelled Denderah) temple complex: A professional tour guide is required to visit, since they can get the special permits needed to enter. Private tours will allow for longer viewing periods than a tour with a large group. Photography is permitted, but flashes are not."
5,The Tomb of Nefertari,"Luxor, Egypt","Known as the Sistine Chapel of Egypt, this tomb houses some of the most well-preserved paintings in Egypt.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tomb-of-nefertari-valley-of-the-queens-tomb-66,"The vast array of paintings inside the tomb of Nefertari, the first of the Great Royal Wives of Ramesses the Great, look as if they were painted just days ago. The vivid colors give visitors a clear idea of what some of the tombs and temples in the area looked like during antiquity. The tomb shows off a different level of detail compared to the other tombs found in Valley of the Kings or even the rest of the Valley of the Queens.","The cost to enter can be pricey and the additional ticket is not cheap, however, it's all well worth it. Time in the tomb is limited to about 10 minutes, but the guards are not too strict about this policy."
6,White Desert,"Al Farafrah, Egypt",An alien landscape of chalk-rock in the Egyptian desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/white-desert,"Just a few hours from the bursting metropolis of Cairo lies a desert that will make you feel like you’ve landed on the surface of the moon. Formed by centuries of erosion and sandstorms, these unique calcium rock formations crop up across the landscape like great abstract statues. Some that resemble food have been given names like “mushroom” and “ice-cream cone,” while others have inspired more grandiose designations, such as “the Monolith” and “Inselberg.” Arguably the most characteristic of these peculiar natural formations is the famed “chicken and tree” set, also called “chicken and mushroom,” or, better yet, “chicken and atomic bomb.” Only in The White Desert will you encounter such a bizarre and awe-inspiring natural museum of chalk-rock. Many people opt to spend a night camping in the desert with Bedouin guides, where they can observe the changing faces of chickens and mushrooms and monoliths as the bright sun of the afternoon sinks into a shadowy dusk. As the sun goes down, the calcium sea seems to reflect all the fuchsias and oranges of the sky. And while any night under the stars of the Western Desert is an experience not soon forgotten, the lucky few that catch a full moon will witness the desert giving off a ghostly, iridescent glow.",
7,Colossi of Memnon,"Luxor, Egypt","These Egyptian statues have survived for 3,400 years and were an acoustic wonder of the ancient world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/colossi-of-memnon,"Since 1350 B.C., these ancient Egyptian statues have loomed over the Theban Necropolis. Though battered by more than 3,400 years of scorching desert sun and sporadic Nile floods, they’ve captivated the imaginations of curious travelers for millennia. The twin colossi (which no longer resemble twins) depict the Pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled during the 18th Dynasty. They once flanked the entrance to his lost mortuary temple, which at its height was the most lavish temple in all of Egypt. Their faded side panels depict Hapy, god of the nearby Nile. Though centuries of floods reduced the temple to no more than looted ruins, these statues have withstood any disaster nature throws their way. In 27 B.C., an earthquake shattered the northern colossus, collapsing its top and cracking its lower half. But strangely, the damaged statue did more than merely survive the catastrophe: After the earthquake, it also found its voice. At dawn, when the first ray of desert sun spilled over the baked horizon, the shattered statue would sing. Its tune was more powerful than pleasant; a fleeting, otherworldly song that evoked mysterious thoughts of the divine. By 20 BC, esteemed tourists from around the Greco-Roman world were trekking across the desert to witness the sunrise acoustic spectacle. Scholars including the likes of Pausanias, Publius, and Strabo recounted tales of the statue’s strange sound ringing through the morning air. Some say it resembled striking brass, while others compared it to the snap of a breaking lyre string. The unearthly song is how these ancient Egyptian statues wound up with a name borrowed from ancient Greece. According to Greek mythology, Memnon, a mortal son of Eos, the goddess of Dawn, was slain by Achilles. Supposedly, the eerie wail echoing from the cracked colossus’ chasm was him crying to his mother each morning. (Modern scientists believe early morning heat caused dew trapped within the statue’s crack to evaporate, creating a series of vibrations that echoed through the thin desert air.) Sadly, well-intentioned Romans silenced the song in the third century. After visiting the storied statues and failing to hear their ephemeral sounds, Emperor Septimius Severus, reportedly attempting to gain favor with the oracular monument, had the fractured statue repaired. His reconstructions, in addition to disfiguring the statue so the fixtures no longer looked like identical twins, robbed the colossus of its famous voice and rendered its song a lost acoustic wonder of the ancient world.","For the past couple of decades, a full excavation of the temple site has been undertaken, and still continues — note the white fence in the distance beyond the colossi, which serves to keep visitors from accidentally falling into excavation trenches. The Colossi are also free to visit."
8,End of the World Cinema,"Qesm Sharm Ash Sheikh, Egypt",An abandoned outdoor movie theater in the Sinai desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/end-of-the-world-cinema,"As you walk on the sand to get to the eeriest theater in the world, the scene feels distinctly post-apocalyptic. This deserted outdoor cinema has yet to see its premiere; its 700 weathered and worn theater seats languish amid the howl of the desert wind. At the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, the abandoned movie theater, dubbed the “End of the World Cinema,” is a silent and bizarre view. It was built by Frenchman Diynn Eadel in the late 1990s, but suffered a power cut on what was supposed to be its premiere night. No one knows what went wrong, but some say the local authorities weren’t thrilled by the prospect of a movie theater in the middle of the desert and were the ones responsible for the generator’s malfunction. At the time, Eadel told a visiting photojournalist that Jurassic Park would be the first movie to play at his Seventh Art Theater. According to the cinema’s introductory flyer, it was meant “to prove that tourism is not necessarily a destructive element and that the Great Theater of Nature can reconcile us with the elements.” However, Eadel’s dream of a theater in the middle of the desert of Egypt remains unrealized, with no further plans of reviving the Sinai cinema. Today, the only audience rides motorbikes through the desert to see the rows of abandoned seats, with their aura of possibility and decay, backdropped by the Sinai hills painted on a screen of a sky full of stars. Update: The cinema was looted and badly damaged. Update April 2018: The area has been closed to tourists by the Egyptian Government.",
9,Desert Breath,"Qesm Hurghada, Egypt",A massive work of modern art that appears to be a crop circle in the middle of the desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/desert-breath,"Rising out of a flat expanse in the Egyptian desert, the earthen cones of Desert Breath seem like giant, alien ant hills, but they are simply art. Completed in 1997 after a number of years under construction, the installation consists of a fractal spiral of conical protrusions and alternately conical depressions. From the ground, the full scope of the project is hard to see, as the site appears to be a string of increasingly large sand piles, with the matching pits from which they were dug lurking nearby. However, when seen from the air, the full effect of the piece becomes clear as the 89 cones and 89 matching depressions spiral out from one another in two geometrically precise arms that increase in diameter the farther they get from the central axis. At the center where the two strings meet, a cone rises up out of a large central pit which was originally filled with water. Despite being otherwise unadorned, the mathematical precision on display at the site creates a sense of wonder. Desert Breath was purpose-built to slowly erode back into the swept sands it was created from and in the decade and a half since its construction, it has begun to do just that. The piece may not be as large as it was when it was installed, but this work of art is still worth a visit for anyone wishing to see an Egyptian monument that isn’t quite so ancient.",
10,Monastery of Saint Simon,"Cairo, Egypt",The massive cave church of Cairo's Zabbaleen community is one of the largest Christian churches in the Middle East.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monastery-of-saint-simon,"Large Christian communities are not abundant in Muslim-dominated Egypt. One of the more populous groups is the garbage scavenging Zabbaleen, who have retained their Coptic beliefs and established the largest Christian church in the Middle East at the Monastery of Saint Simon. The Zabbaleen (meaning literally “garbage collectors”) village at the base of the Mokattam cliffs began around 1969 when the Cairo governor decided to move all of the garbage collectors to a single settlement. The garbage collectors were largely Coptic Christians and as their numbers continued to grow over the years the need for a centralized church began to grow. In 1975, the first Christian church was built in the village but after a large fire broke out nearby, work began on a monastery that was built right into the cliffside. The Monastery of Saint Simon was the result of this new project. Simon the Tanner was a craftsman saint who lived during the 10th century and the cave church that was dedicated to him seems as though it might last for 10 more. Using a pre-existing cave and the slope that led into it, the current monastery seats 2,000 people around a central pulpit. Other nearby caves have also been built into separate church spaces and all of them have been linked to create a massive Christian complex in the heart of garbage city. Since tourism through the scavenger’s village is not a thriving industry, reaching the Monastery of Saint Simon is no small feat, yet as the largest Christian church within a handful of countries, hundreds of thousands of people make the pilgrimage each year.",There are 3 churches to check out at this spot.

11,Pyramid of Djoser,"Al Badrashin, Egypt",This ancient structure is widely thought to be the oldest intact pyramid in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-of-djoser,"Built as a tomb for the pharaoh Djoser (or Zoser), the Djoser Pyramid was constructed between 2630 BC and 2611 BC in Saqqara, Egypt. Although it is considered the world’s oldest intact large-scale stone monument, the ancient structure is often overshadowed by Egypt’s most famous pyramids. The Djoser Pyramid stands 197 feet high and was built using 11.6 million cubic feet of stone and clay. Imhotep—a doctor, priest, and sculptor, among other titles and talents—is widely attributed as the pyramid’s architect. Initially, the structure was designed as a traditional, flat-roofed tomb called a mastaba, but Djoser wanted something bigger, something grander. So tradition was put aside for innovation, and in the span of Djoser’s 19-year rule the pyramid expanded to its current six layers, with a height that made it the largest building of its time. The step pyramid’s unique structure was also an important architectural advancement: The famous pyramids of Giza, for example, are the result of techniques seen practiced here. The pyramid was part of a larger 40-acre complex containing a courtyard, temples, and chapels, all enclosed inside a 30-foot wall. The entrance to the complex, as well as 13 fake doors, is built into the wall. The complex also includes a number of building facades, all of which served ritual purposes. The pharaoh’s burial chambers are located deep within the pyramid, along with those of his 11 daughters. The burial chamber is part of the pyramid’s winding, maze-like series of tunnels, which researchers think may have been designed to prevent theft (although the pyramid was eventually looted). Sadly, these protective tunnels may actually be part of the reason for the pyramid’s deterioration. Without conservation, experts fear that the 3.5 miles (5.5 kilometers) of tunnels could collapse, taking the historic monument with it. Efforts to conserve the building have been controversial, as a company tasked with the restoration has been accused of doing the opposite: it was claimed that the restoration work was actually further damaging the pyramid. Google reviews in 2023 indicate that once again tourists can ener the Pyramid of Djoser. Visitors are also welcome to stand in awe in front of this architectural feat and see what has been called “a revolutionary conception that would influence the entire history of Egyptian architecture.”",

But the park is hidden behind high walls, keeping it a peaceful oasis within the crowded city. Built by Zulfugar Pasha in 1929 as a gift for his wife, this botanical-style garden on Gezira Island in the neighborhood of Zamalek is special among the parks in Cairo. The architect originally designed the landscape to be part of the royal mansion of Khedive Ismail, and its former grandeur can still be felt today. The most unique aspect of the park are the preserved old structures designed in the traditional Andalusian architectural style, based on designs from Moorish Spain. The lush greenery is studded with colorful mosaic benches and steps surrounding a large fountain. There are many interesting statues, depicting Pharaohs, lions, and the famous Egyptian poet Ahmed Shawky, the “Prince of Poets,” who was known for his love poems. Beautiful panoramic views of the Nile, and the city across, add to the already romantic atmosphere of the landscape. It’s a wonderful respite from the busy streets of Cairo, harkening back to a former era of the city.",The park is hidden behind high walls but the easiest way to spot it is that it's across from the Sofitel Hotel & Cairo Tower street entrance.
13,Cairo's City of the Dead,"Cairo, Egypt","In Egypt's expanding metro area, many of the neighbors are dead.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-of-the-dead-cairo-egypt,"Just outside of Cairo, this City of the Dead used to house only corpses dating back to the 7th century. Created as an Arabic cemetery during the conquest of Egypt, the necropolis has developed into one of Egypt’s worst slums where the dead and living coexist in morbid neighborliness. 20 million people live in Cairo’s metro area, making it one of the largest cities in the entire world. It also has a massive population living in abject poverty, which has forced many people into the City of the Dead. Stretching for four miles on the outskirts of Cairo, the row housing for the deceased has evolved into a deathly slum. As people moved out of agricultural centers, or were displaced by natural disasters, they took up residences in old mausoleums, and around the tombs of the necropolis. In total, 500,000 people occupy the necropolis, filling the gaps around the final resting places of 7th century Egyptians. Although there are plans to relocate people out of the living cemetery, the population has grown so large that there is almost nowhere to move residents. Like so many other slums across the world, the City of the Dead is greatly populated by children, who must face fears and live in and around tombs, and make do with their morbid surroundings.",
14,Wadi al-Hitan (Valley of the Whales),"Ibsheway, Egypt",Egyptian treasure trove of fossils documenting the whale's transition from land mammal to sea creature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wadi-al-hitan,"Few sites in the world speak of an evolutionary tale as rich and captivating as that of Wadi al-Hitan, Egypt’s “Whale Valley.” There, amid a wind-sculpted landscape of sand and rocks, lies a large collection of the most unexpected of animal remains—whale fossils. To be exact, the scattered bones belong to a long-extinct suborder of whales known as archaeoceti. What really sets these ancient creatures apart from your ordinary, modern-day cetacean is one odd, yet profoundly important, anatomical difference—hind legs. This critical deviation in the fossil record of whales is the basis for the notion that the massive seafaring beasts we know today began their existence as land-based animals. But since their discovery in 1902, the fossils of Wadi al-Hitan have tended to raise more questions than they’ve answered. While the hundreds of archaeocete skeletons provide a rare and valuable snapshot of whales in the final stages of losing their hind limbs and transitioning to a marine existence, evolutionary biologists are still left puzzled over the identity of the whale’s earliest ancestor. Similarities in tooth shape led to the long-held belief that whales were related to mesonychids, carnivorous hoofed mammals that closely resembled wolves. It wasn’t until 2005 that a team of American and French scientists finally discovered the missing link between whales and their closest relative, the hippopotamus. This discovery, supported by another collection of cetacean fossils located in Pakistan, placed the whale in the different taxonomic group of artiodactyls, which includes such unexpected relatives as camels, pigs, and giraffes. Although the fossils at Wadi al-Hitan are certainly not the oldest in the world, their sheer number and remarkable preservation (even some stomach contents are still intact!) make them invaluable to paleontologists and evolutionary scientists. For this reason, Egypt’s “Whale Valley” was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. The justification behind this honor is even more apparent when considering the diversity of fossils seen at Wadi al-Hitan. Aside from the impressive archaeocete fossils, the largest of which measures 21 meters in length, fossils of other early animals such as sharks, crocodiles, and turtles are also found at the site. Wadi al-Hitan may be hard to reach, typically receiving only 1,000 visitors each year, but for the few fortunate enough to get there, an astounding oasis documenting millions of years of coastal marine life awaits.

15,Unfinished Obelisk,"Aswan, Egypt",The largest known Ancient Egyptian obelisk.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/unfinished-obelisk,"Around the Upper Egyptian city of Aswan are several ancient stone quarries, which were the source of Ancient Egypt’s finest granite. The Northern Quarries of Aswan holds the remains of the Unfinished Obelisk. Had it have ever been erected, this obelisk would have been the largest one of Ancient Egypt and would have reached a stunning height of 42 meters. The largest finished obelisk, the Lateran Obelisk is 10 meters shorter than the Unfinished Obelisk, and today stands in Rome, Italy. Although not the largest obelisk, it is nevertheless the largest known monolith of Ancient Egypt, and one of the largest in the world, with an estimated weight of 1,200 tons. The work on the Unfinished Obelisk had been abandoned due to clearly visible cracks that appeared in the granite. The huge structure, which is partly connected to the parent rock, has been left in situ. The obelisk, together with several worker’s marks and rock carvings, provides a rare insight into the working techniques of Ancient Egypt. Virtually nothing is known about which pharaoh ordered the Obelisk and where it was supposed to be erected.",
16,Temple of Kom Ombo,"Nagoa Ash Shatb, Egypt",One of its engravings is believed to be among the first representations of medical and surgical instruments.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-of-kom-ombo,"The Temple of Kom Ombo is an unusual double temple constructed during the Ptolemaic period, which lasted from 108 to 47 BC. The ancient Egyptian place of worship features a unique engraving that is thought to be among the first representations of medical and surgical instruments. The relief showing the medical tools is among the most intriguing features of the temple. It can be found in the building’s rear, in the passageway that surrounds the main area. The depicted surgical instruments include scalpels, curettes, forceps, specula, scissors, medicine bottles, and prescriptions. The image is completed with two goddesses sitting on birthing chairs. At the time the relief was carved, Egyptian medical science was almost certainly the most advanced in the world. The temple’s double dedication is reflected in its layout: It’s perfectly symmetrical along the main axis and has twin entrances, two connected hypostyle halls with the reliefs of two gods on either side of a column, twin chambers, and twin sanctuaries. The eastern half of the temple was dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek (god of the Nile and creator of the world), his wife Hathor, and their son Khonsu. The western half of the temple was dedicated to the falcon god Horus (god of the sky and protector of the king), his wife Tasenetnofret, and their son Panebtawy. It is likely that there were two separate priesthoods who tended to the deities. Much of the temple has been destroyed by natural forces and builders who used its materials for other projects. Some of the reliefs were defaced by Copts who once used the temple as their church. However, what survived is still reminiscent of its magnificent history. The walls and columns are decorated with finely executed reliefs of both the gods. Some surfaces even managed to hold onto their original colors.",
17,Great Sand Sea Glass of the Libyan Desert,"Qesm Al Wahat Ad Dakhlah, Egypt",Even King Tut was intrigued by the glass of the Great Sand Sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lybian-desert-glass,"A very special and remote area between the sand dunes of the southwest corner of Egypt, the Great Sand Sea presents a rare and mysterious treasure. There are many theories about the origins of the unique Libyan glass. Some think that it is related to radiative melting, or ancient warfare. The glass was first discovered by stone-age Aterian peoples, who made tools from the glass, and later by Egyptians. A polished piece of glass was centered in an elaborate piece of jewelry found in King Tutankhamen’s tomb. Since these times, the glass remained untouched because of the harshness and inaccessibility of the region. After King Tut’s time, P.A. Clayton was the first to explore the area in the 1930s. He collected samples that helped to develop the first scientific description of the glass and theories of its creation. The harsh landscape and environment prevented visitors to the area until the 1970s, when two meteor impact structures were discovered, providing further evidence of the origins of the fascinating glass. Today, the glass is a popular souvenir, but how King Tut got his hands on it remains a mystery. It has been estimated that the glass was formed around 26 million years ago. Chemical analysis of the natural glass reveals that it is fortified with “meteoritic elements with typical chondritic proportions,” leading scientists to believe that the glass is the chemical result of a meteorite colliding with the nearly 100% silica composition of the sand.",
18,Blue Desert,"Qesm Sharm Ash Sheikh, Egypt",Brightly painted boulders scattered throughout the Sinai Desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-desert,"Not far from Mount Sinai, in the Saint Katherine Protectorate, lies the Blue Desert. Unlike the White Desert and the Black Desert (both in the Egyptian Sahara), the Blue Desert is not a natural creation, but a work of art. Created in 1980 by Belgian artist Jean Verame, the groundbreaking Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement (1979) inspired the artist to paint several large boulders in this otherwise barren desert region in a bright blue color, symbolizing peace. The unusual peace monument is situated in the South of the Sinai Peninsula, a region which prior to the Peace Agreement, saw numerous battles between the warring countries. The artist used a total of 10 tons of paint, which were granted from the United Nations. Verame has since created similar monumental pieces of art in Morocco and Chad.

19,Tanis,"Tanis, Egypt",The once great capital of Egypt now crumbles forward as evocative ruins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tanis,"Empires rise and empires fall but few have left such beautiful and mysterious ruins as the ancient Egyptians, and many of the most fascinating finds in the region come from the “lost” city of Tanis. Known to the ancient Egyptians as Djanet, the city served as the capital to the 21st and 22nd Egyptian dynasties thanks to its strength as a commercial center. The settlement was located right on the Nile which gave the prosperous populace access to water and trade that most other cities of the time could barely rival. Unfortunately this “middle” period in Egyptian history was defined by political upheaval which made the city socially unstable and combined with the shifting waters of the Nile, Tanis soon fell off of the map. Extensive accounts of the ancient city were discovered in other areas of Egypt but the actual ruins of Tanis seemed to elude archaeologists, leading to the belief that it was a “lost city.” However in 1939, a French archeologist uncovered a pristine burial tomb from the city which contained a wealth of artifacts and jewelry rivaled by almost no other Egyptian archaeological site. The royal tombs and the accompanying temple are now all that remains of the once great city of Tanis, but the immeasurable knowledge we have gained from just its scant few remnants speaks to how grand this Egyptian capital must have been.",
20,Red Sea Blue Hole,"Qesm Saint Katrin, Egypt",The deadliest diving spot in the world is also a stunning geological marvel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/red-sea-blue-hole,"The Blue Hole in the Red Sea just north of Dahab, Egypt, is known as the “Diver’s Cemetery” for the staggering number of intrepid swimmers who perished in its depths. At least 40 divers have died in the 462 feet deep blue hole — a geological phenomenon where a chasm created from an underwater cave opens for several hundred feet while the area around it is much shallower. Memorials on a ridge overlook the diving spot, where despite, or because of, its infamy, people still swim in the hole every single day. The danger of the Blue Hole is that there’s a tunnel through the reef that connects it to open water, and while the signs on shore advertise “Easy Entry,” it’s the escape from the seaward tunnel that is deadly.",
21,Dendera Light,"Dandarah, Egypt","Ancient Egyptian relief, claimed to depict an electrical light.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dendera-light,"The Dendera Light is a depiction on a stone relief at the Hathor Temple, located at the Upper Egyptian temple complex of Dendera. It has been a major source of controversy in Egyptian history, since many fringe historians interpret the depiction as evidence of a modern lighting system similar in appearance to a Crookes tube.  It is located in a long underground passageway directly beneath the main temple that like the temple itself is completely covered in bas relief carvings.  Both space and access is limited and I believe you will not be allowed entry (or even discover the guarded entrance) unless you are accompanied by a licensed Egyptian guide and then as a individual, pair or perhaps family with older children. Among those who share this view is the controversial Swiss pseudo-archaeologist Erich von Däniken. Supporters of this theory claim that electrical light would give an explanation to the absence of lampblack deposits in many discovered tombs. The Dendera Light is often used in a similar context as the “Baghdad Battery,” in the assumption that ancient cultures were much more advanced than we believe today. The mainstream view among Egyptologists interprets the reliefs as a combination of a Lotus flower, a Djed pillar (a symbol of stability, symbolised by the outstretched arms), and a snake rising from the flower through the womb of Nut. Inscriptions around the “Dendera Light” support this view, since these reference the rising sun, which will spring out of a lotus flower in the shape of the snake god Semataui. According to Egyptologists, the bulb-like structure represents the womb of Nut, the goddess of the sky, which is also a common depiction for the night. Thus, the relief might show the rising sun making its way through the night. Despite the proof against electrical technology in ancient Egypt, the reliefs continue to stir up controversy as pseudo-scientists attempt to cling to any proof of advanced technological inventions in ancient peoples.","Dendera, Qena Governorate, Egypt.

22,'Helicopter' Hieroglyphs,"Markaz Al Belina, Egypt","Some believe that this ancient mural depicts technology far ahead of its time, but in reality it's nothing quite out of place.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/helicopter-hieroglyphs,"The Temple of Seti I in Abydos features an ancient Egyptian frieze that is believed by UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists to be an out-of-place artifact, not unlike the infamous Dendera Light. Among hieroglyphs such as the fly and whatnot, the engraving shows what seems to be a helicopter, as well as airplanes and a submarine. In some pseudoscientific circles, these hieroglyphs have been interpreted as a representation of modern technology in antiquity, knowledge perhaps given to the Egyptians by time travelers or extraterrestrial entities. But most archaeologists agree that the carvings are nothing unusual. The hieroglyphs depicting “modern technology” are an example of pareidolia, our tendency to perceive a pattern or meaning that isn’t actually there. Other examples of pareidolia include the perception of a human face in the moon or a church tower that looks like a chicken. The real explanation behind the “helicopter” has to do with the legacies of different rulers. In ancient Egypt, it was common for hieroglyphs to be re-carved over time, especially when a new pharaoh came into power. Digital imaging has shown that these images come from two separate images on top of each other. The original carving, created during the reign of Seti I, translated to “He who repulses the nine enemies of Egypt.” It was later remade by artists during the reign of Rameses II to read “He who protects Egypt and overthrows foreign countries.” The plaster used to cover the Seti I inscription eroded over time, which led to the appearance of a single combined image. Conspiracy theorists have digitally altered photographs of the carving to remove details and make it look more like modern technology in order to support their pseudoscientific narratives.",
23,Tombs of the Nobles,"Abu AR Rish Qebli, Egypt",A network of ancient Egyptian tombs built into the cliff face along the Nile.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tombs-of-the-nobles,"Rising up along the west bank of the Nile is a relatively little-visited archaeological gem, the Tombs of the Nobles, also called Qubbet el-Hawa, where ancient carvings and hieroglyphics still exist alongside Christian murals and Muslim monuments. This sand-swept cliffside necropolis is located a short ferry ride across the river from Aswan, and can be seen from all around the city. The site is home to hundreds of rock-cut tombs housing the remains of high-ranking and noble Egyptians from antiquity. Many tombs date back as much as 3,800 years. They are decorated with paintings, hieroglyphics, and statues, and some of the larger tombs can be entered and explored. First discovered by British archaeologist Lord Greenville in 1885, the cemetery is still being excavated to this day. The list of notable residents is long, but some of the more famous burials from the Old and Middle Kingdom include the tomb of Harkhuf—famous for being covered in inscriptions that give a glimpse into the culture of the era—governors of the Egyptian Pharaohs Pepi II and Amenemhat II and the Lady Sattjeni from the ruling family of Elephantine.","Locals will try to sell you felucca rides across the West Bank on arrival in Aswan, but it's best to head to the public ferry at the Nile Cruise terminal, which costs 5EgP each way.

24,Tamr Hena Museum,"Alexandria, Egypt","Part shoe store, part sociopolitical art gallery, part zoo.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tamr-hena-museum,"Alexandria, Egypt, has a rich history that has been influenced across thousands of years by the ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman Empires; the early Christian church; the expansion of Islam; and most recently by the democratic revolutions of the Arab Spring. There is plenty of historical evidence of all of this for the regular sightseeing visitor. But once you’ve worn out your shoes walking around all the ruins and monuments, you’ll want to visit Nasser ElSherbini’s Shoe Store, recently converted into the Tamr Hena Museum. At first this eclectic museum seems like a random if entertaining collection. But after a cup of tea with the owner, visitors will learn how it all ties together to represent the peoples’ struggle and the unfortunate survival of corruption throughout the various ages and regimes. A former athlete and hunter, ElSherbini operated his small shoe store for many years before an itch to do something different led him to begin sculpting clay and paper-mâché figures and monsters to entertain the children who came in for new shoes. Soon, his artwork began to take on a sociopolitical meaning, when the Egyptian economy suffered extreme setbacks after the political revolutions of January 2011 and June 2013. Immediately upon entering, you are faced with a scaly Hydra descending from the ceiling, with its many serpentine heads representing racism, ignorance, and other social woes. A melancholy statue sits by the door, selling jars of lies and betrayal. The caged monkeys and free-roaming snakes are a unique Orwellian-Egyptian metaphor, as well as a fun photo opportunity. Without directly insulting any powerful figures, ElSherbini has transformed his shop into a fascinating little world for creative criticism.","To get to the museum, take the cable car/tram to the Ibrahimeya Station and walk west about 60 meters down Omar Lotfy Street."
25,St. Catherine's Monastery,"Qesm Saint Katrin, Egypt",Charnel house at the foot of Mount Sinai.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-catherine-s-monastery,"Without a Bedouin guide, the Sinai is a vast, unnavigable expanse of desert. Rocky hills rise and fall underneath the blinding sun. And yet for thousands of years, this desolate peninsula was traversed and played host to many of the most important religious events in history. Many of these seminal events are neatly encapsulated within the walls of St. Catherine’s Monastery. Situated below Mount Sinai, St. Catherine’s Monastery was originally built by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the early 6th century. It is considered the oldest monastery in the world, although this claim is disputed. Much of the landscape around St. Catherine’s is similarly disputed, along with the claim that the peak above the monastery is actually the biblical Mount Sinai. Within the gates of the monastery, the unknown only grows. When Justinian declared a monastery be built on the land, a chapel dedicated to the burning bush was already in place. Once again, disputed claims placed the burning bush that appeared to Moses near the present-day monastery. To this day, a bush inside the compound is considered by some to be the original from biblical texts. Besides the chapel, the monastic compound also holds an ancient charnel for monks. Although monks are typically thought of as the most pious men who have dedicated their lives to God, the monks of St. Catherine often broke that mold, and were sent to the Sinai as punishment. As they died off, the pious next to the profane in the midst of the desert’s sparse resources, the monks discovered the ground was unsuitable for proper burials. Their only answer was to create a house of skulls, piling the bones of the religious men in a charnel below the monastery. Differing from many ossuaries and charnels, St. Catherine’s was based more on functionality than decoration, and the massive pile of remains speaks to that gruesome end. St. Catherine’s Monastery is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. For more information on amazing ossuaries, charnels and skeletal remains around the world, visit Paul Koudounaris’ website Empire de la Mort, or purchase his definitive book  The Empire of Death: A Cultural History of Ossuaries and Charnel Houses.",
26,Hatshepsut's Myrrh Tree,"Luxor, Egypt",This unassuming tree stump reportedly traces its roots to the famous pharaoh queen's reign.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hatshepsuts-myrrh-tree,"Despite attempts to erase evidence of her reign, Pharaoh Hatshepsut’s mark on history proved indelible. Even now, we revere the New Kingdom’s pharaoh queen as having been one of the best rulers not just in ancient Egypt but in the history of the world. At Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple on the Nile, a withered ancient tree stump defies the unrelenting Egyptian sun, still standing as a testimony to the female royal’s influence and political prowess. Supposedly, this myrrh tree dates back to one of the many expeditions commissioned by Hatshepsut some 3,500 years ago. According to the narrative, the tree was brought back from one of the monarch’s seafaring delegations to Punt, which is described as a land on the Red Sea (most likely present-day Somalia and other parts of the Horn of Africa). The myrrh was then planted next to the grand mortuary temple of Hatshepsut, also called Djeser-Djeseru, which translates to “Holy of Holies.” While it’s difficult to verify this particular claim without damaging the fragile, dry stump, there is no doubt that Hatshepsut ordered many expeditions, one of them to Punt. Relief carvings still decorated with traces of the once-brilliant colors that coated them depict this journey to this exotic land, including the trees and other goods transported back to Egypt. Constructed as a mortuary complex for the great pharaoh queen, Djeser-Djeseru was covered in images commemorating Hatshepsut and her accomplishments. At times, she elected to be depicted as a male, perhaps to emphasize the fact that she governed with a power and authority previously wielded only by men. In many ways, Hatshepsut was more successful than most of her male predecessors. She built more structures than any male ruler of Egypt before her. Under her sagacious guidance, Egypt enjoyed enormous prosperity thanks to her successful raids on Nubia and her distribution of wealth. Unfortunately, many of the carved records recounting this remarkable sovereign’s exploits and achievements were effaced once her stepson and nephew, Thutmose III, came into power after her death. At first, scholars assumed that Thutmose III sought revenge; after all, it was he who was supposed to inherit the throne from his father, but Hatshepsut seized the chance to rule in his stead as a regent. She supported her claim by arguing that the infant pharaoh was too young to direct an empire at the time of his father’s death. Many assumed that Thutmose III was angered by this usurping of power and thus strove to expunge Hatshepsut from history as retribution. However, some recent scholarship suggests that perhaps Thutmose III did not hold any ill will towards his stepmother-aunt—especially given the fact that he co-ruled with her for a time—and that his motivation for erasing evidence of her rule was merely pragmatic. He hoped to solidify his claim to the throne by giving the impression of a direct transmission of power from his father to him. Whatever the reason, despite his efforts, a record of Hatshepsut and her great deeds eventually surfaced. Djeser-Djeseru was never demolished; the worst damage it sustained was due to falling rocks. Despite the passage of thousands of years, enough of it remained to be reconstructed. The northern section of the upper terrace houses a Sun Complex. The temple also includes chapels to Amun-Re and Anubis. Parts of the temple were eventually repurposed. Beginning with St. Mark’s proselytizing, Egyptians began to convert from their pharaonic religion to Christianity. As with many ancient Egyptian sites, Hatshepsut’s temple was reused by locals, and in the 600s, a mudbrick Coptic monastery was built on the remains of the temple’s upper terrace. The entire complex was eventually excavated and rebuilt with the help of the Polish Academy of Science. Restored to its former glory, the temple’s epic presence punctures the looming cliffs on the west side of the Nile River.","The tree stump and marker stand on the grounds of Djeser-Djeseru, located on the Nile near the Valley of the Kings. This is an extremely hot location, and while you can buy water at a small tourist center, it's much cheaper to pack your own."
27,The Hanging Church,"Cairo, Egypt","Standing atop 2nd-century Roman ruins, this church is one of the oldest and most iconic in Old Cairo.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-hanging-church,"Contrary to what its name implies, the Hanging Church—Al Moallaqa—is not actually suspended from anything. Its unusual moniker comes from the fact that it’s built on top of the gates of an old Roman fortress. Located within Old Coptic Cairo (Masr al-Qadima) in what was ancient Egypt’s Heliopolite Nome, the Hanging Church is just a stone’s throw from the famous Babylon Fortress. The imposing stronghold was built by edict of the Roman emperor Diocletian, near the harbor settlement and canal commissioned years before by Emperor Trajan. Trajan’s 2nd-century canal was not the first attempt to build a waterway from the Nile to the Red Sea. There is evidence of Pharaonic and Achaemenid efforts—such as those undertaken by Seti I and Darius I, respectively—to excavate a channel connecting the river to the sea. Needless to say, the Hanging Church sits on land of great historical significance. Although its first mention came much later, the first iteration of the Hanging Church likely appeared in the 3rd or 4th century, beginning as a humble construction with palm logs and stones as a foundation. A more permanent structure was built in the 690s. In 1047, the Coptic Orthodox pope’s seat was moved from its historical home in Alexandria to the Hanging Church, where it remained until the 13th century. Beyond its historical and religious importance, the church has a number of architecturally distinguishing features. Two bell towers loom above the church, which as a whole is modeled to resemble Noah’s ark. Notably, the church is one of the first in Egypt to be built in the style of a basilica. The porch, which dates to the 11th century, has somewhat miraculously survived centuries of shuffling feet and processions. Beautiful lotus-shaped inlaid wooden panels decorate the wall above the altar just below images of Jesus’s disciplines, who are painted in a distinctly Coptic style. Some influence from Islamic art traditions can be detected on the church’s outer façade. Now located in the British Museum, 10 cedarwood panels from around 1300 once adorned the screen doors of a chapel. These panels are covered in intricate feast scenes and representations of biblical events such as the Nativity, Baptism, and Pentecost. The Hanging Church isn’t the only must-see ancient edifice in the vicinity. Nearby is the ‘Amr Ibn Al-‘As mosque, named after the Arab general who led the conquest of Egypt in 640. Not only is this mosque the first built in Egypt, it’s also the first in the entirety of Africa. A short walk away is the Ben Ezra Synagogue, an architectural gem and one of the last remaining testaments to the once-vibrant Egyptian Jewish community. Mari Girgis (St. George) Church, Abu Serga Church, and the Convent of St. George are other centuries-old holy sites in the neighborhood. History buffs should pop into the Coptic Museum, which is also located by the Hanging Church. Like the Nile, Egypt is overflowing—overflowing with sights, sounds, people, and, most of all, historical sights. It is nearly impossible for the casual traveler to see everything. Nonetheless, the Hanging Church and the famous buildings in its proximity should not be skipped.","There is no cost for admission. The church is open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Coptic Mass is held from 8 a.m. to  11 a.m. on Wednesdays and Fridays, and from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Sundays. Visitors are welcome to observe. There is no strict dress code, but it's better to wear clothing that goes down to at least your knees and avoid spaghetti straps."
28,The Cairo Genizah,"Cairo, Egypt",Hundreds of thousands of ancient documents offer a unique glimpse into Jewish life in Cairo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-cairo-genizah-cairo-egypt,"The Ben Ezra Synagogue was built in al-Fustat, the first capital of Egypt under Arab rule. Today, al-Fustat is part of Old Cairo. Abraham ibn Ezra of Jerusalem purchased the land for the synagogue in 882. According to local tradition, the synagogue was built on the spot where baby Moses was found adrift on the Nile, but that’s not the only thing that sets this site apart. In the 19th century a collection of almost 280,000 Jewish manuscript fragments were found in the genizah (depository) of the Ben Ezra Synagogue. In 1896, English travelers Agnes S. Lewis and Margaret D. Gibson returned from Egypt with fragments from the genizah, and showed them to Solomon Schechter at Cambridge. Today, Taylor-Schechter’s collection at Cambridge has nearly 193,000 fragments. There are a further 31,000 fragments at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. The John Rylands University Library in Manchester holds a collection of over 11,000 fragments. The genizah is the final resting place of “trashed” documents that invoke the name of God. It is forbidden to throw away writings containing the name of God, even if they are personal letters or legal contracts. Genizot are usually found in the attic or basement of a synagogue, but can also be in walls or buried underground. The Ben Ezra Synagogue genizah’s 280,000 documents were written between 950 CE and 1800 CE. There are notes, private correspondence, old contracts, and business-related material alongside religious manuscripts. Some documents were written by prominent people like Maimonides, while others were written by regular members of the community. There are materials from Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Tunisia, Sicily, and even India. The genizah provides an unprecedented look into medieval Jewish life in the Middle East. Most primary documents from the Middle Ages are records of momentous events of men and nations. The genizah reveals day-to-day details about ordinary people - individuals with names and personalities, strengths and weaknesses. Documents relate to these people’s innermost fears and yearnings, intimate relations, business rifts and rivalries, personal triumphs, and tragedies. The genizah documents also shed light on medieval history beyond Cairo. The rich store of linguistic works trace the history of Arabic dialects. Further, unique Arab manuscripts were found, like the pharmacological work of 11th century doctor Ahmed Ibn Al-Djazzar and a love story of Umayyid caliph Al-Walid II from the 8th century. There were fragments of Greek translations of the Bible by Aquila. A 10th century letter from Kyiv provided the earliest evidence of a Jewish community existing in the Ukraine. The fragments also tell the history of the Caspian kingdom of the Khazars and its conversion to Judaism in the 9th century. Among the most recent works are Yiddish letters and poems from the 13th to 15th centuries.",Located in Coptic Cairo.

Its distinctive architecture and placement have led to the proliferation of rumors over the years. In its prime, the palace had luxurious gardens, gilded doors, and Belgian mirrors designed by Georges-Louis Claude. Built between 1907 and 1911, the mansion is covered with detailed animals and figures inspired by Orissa in India and Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Now long-abandoned, the palace is said to be connected to underground tunnels which lead to the nearby Catholic basilica where the Baron is buried. The Baron’s life was somewhat tragic and long after his death, he remains a mysterious figure in city-lore. His wife allegedly fell to her death from the main tower of the palace—which is reached via a spectacular revolving spiral staircase—and his mentally ill daughter was found dead in a basement chamber a few years after her mother’s death. After World War I, the Baron returned to Europe and his son took control of the house, hosting parties and living the good life, but by the July 23 revolution in 1952, the house had been sold. In more recent times, the house has been the supposed location of satanic rituals, heavy metal parties, orgies, and animal sacrifices. There are rumored sightings of the Baron’s daughter, of furniture moving across rooms, and of parties going on late into the night. Before the Arab Spring, the government had plans to remodel the palace and open it as a museum or park, but with the deposing of Hosni Mubarak, the project came to a halt. In 2017, there had been reports that the government would renovate the palace and use it as a conference space, but as of yet, these plans have yet to materialize.","As of 2023, entry is 60 pounds, free for seniors"

There are also less photogenic examples of triangular tombs that have not weathered the ages quite so well, like The Pyramid of Senusret II. Senusret II ruled Egypt during the end of the 1800s BCE.  When he died, he was placed in a pyramid tomb like many Egyptian rulers before and since. However Senusret II’s tomb, like his father’s was a bit of a cheat architecturally. Unlike the pyramids of Giza which were made with limestone blocks, the tomb of Senusret II was made of mud bricks supported by a limestone base. To finish the effect and protect the mud brick insides, the whole structure was encased in an outer layer of limestone. Was the pyramid left intact, it likely would have survived somewhat better into the modern age, but unfortunately the outer casings were later scavenged by Ramses II for his own monumental purposes, leaving the mud brick exposed to chunk off and fall away over the centuries. But not all was lost, and miraculously the remains of the weaker brick pyramid remain to this day. Thanks in part to it’s limestone interior, the remaining burial chambers managed to remain and began to be investigated in the 1800s (even though they had long since been pillaged by grave robbers). Today the pyramid can still be visited, even if it is not as pretty and popular as it’s more postcard-ready brethren.",

It is located in the sparsely populated, far west region of Egypt, only 30 miles from the Libyan border. Because the Siwan people are so isolated from the rest of the country, they have developed their own language (Berber), culture, and customs (women, although rarely seen in public, completely cover their bodies, including the face). As a tourist, there is much to do in Siwa, including desert safaris (which include sand surfing!), donkey-driven village tours led by local children, and exploration of wondrous oracle ruins. There are also plenty of delicious dates and olives to eat, provided by the thick palm groves and olive orchards that surround the city. Getting to Siwa is a bit of a journey from Cairo (5+ hour train, and then a 4 hour bus ride), but it is definitely worth the trek, especially if you’re looking to escape to some peace and quiet after the extreme crowds and liveliness of Cairo.

33,Agricultural Museum of Cairo,"Cairo, Egypt",A huge museum of much more than just agriculture displayed in a princess's palace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agricultural-museum-cairo,"Once the breadbasket of the Roman Empire, Egypt has a long agricultural history, so it’s no surprise to find a museum in Cairo dedicated to Egypt’s farming past. The surprise lies in what this museum contains, which is much more than simply agricultural. A huge complex with gardened grounds covering about 100 thousand square meters and buildings occupying another 20 thousand square meters, the Agricultural Museum of Cairo is a lot to take in. Founded in 1930, the museum was to be the first agricultural museum in the world. The founders sought a grand location to display a grand collection, thus the museum was installed in the palace of Princess Fatima. The collection contains a vast array of objects in ten halls. One hall of particular interest is the “museum of bread,” devoted entirely to baking, machines used in baking, and displays of various types of bread. Collections in other halls include a room of wax models of typical Egyptian meals, a large selection of preserved animals, and digestion displays including an inflated cow’s stomach. The real highlight of the museum, however, is the Scientific Collection Hall, which contains an amazing array of wax anatomical models, taxidermy, insect collections, anatomy specimens and general oddities, all of which have been little changed since the 1930s. Sadly, the last 80 years have not been kind to the collection. A taxidermied lion lies on its side, his legs having been destroyed by being dragged from place to place, and much of the museum is closed or in disrepair. According to visitor Oliver Wilkins, one can tip the caretaker to let you into closed areas. The museum plans to open a new wing of the agricultural museum, but it would be wise to go soon, before the old museum disappears. In the words of Wilkins, “Who knows how long it will be until it goes the way of Cairo’s other lost museums? See it while you can.” Update as of December 2022: The museum is currently closed due to ongoing renovations.",
34,Malkata Palace,"Luxor, Egypt",The city-sized home palace of one of ancient Egypt's most powerful rulers gives us a rare look into the lives of the epoch's rulers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/malkata-palace,"Amenhotep III, Amenhotep the Magnificent, ruled over Egypt for almost 40 years, from 1386 BCE to 1349 BCE, and never before had Egypt seen such wealth, such power, or such ostentation. He ruled as pharaoh and as a god-king from his sprawling palace of Malkata. In all that remains to us of ancient Egypt, the homes of the dead and the homes of the gods have fared far better than the homes of the living. However the huge site of the palace of Malkata, which now lies in ruins, is one of the few places capable of hinting at the splendor of the pharaohs’ lives. Courtyards, audience-chambers, harems, and a gigantic ceremonial lake have been discovered at the Malkata site. Researchers have found that the walls were covered with bright, delicate paintings, some of which are still faintly visible. Animals, flowers, and the reed-beds along the Nile were all depicted on the walls of the pharaoh’s grand estate. Malkata was a home on the scale of a city, except built for a single ruler. Amenhotep’s wife had her own wing of the huge estate and the artificial lake was built strictly so that the ruler and family could sail on it. The site was so large that there is even a set of apartments known as the “West Villas” that would have housed the various workers and staff on site. Today, the ruins of Malkata stretch across the desert close to Thebes, still marking the pinnacle of Amenhotep’s 3,000 year old empire.",
35,Cairo’s Garbage City,"Cairo, Egypt",Slum Settlement Filled With Mountains of Garbage.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/garbage-city,"Manshiyat Nasser, or as it is more popularly known, Garbage City,“ is a slum settlement with a population of around 60,000 on the outskirts of the Moqattam Hills, within Cairo’s sprawling metropolitan area. The village is notable for having nearly every space of it covered in garbage, including the streets and rooftops of the settlement. These piles of garbage are the result of the Cairo Metropolitan Area having never established an efficient garbage collecting system, despite having a population of nearly 20 million. The inhabitants of Manshiyat Nasser, mostly Coptic Christians, have filled this gap for the past 70 years. These informal garbage collectors, called the Zabbaleen or “Garbage people,“ collect the garbage of Cairo’s residents in a door-to-door service for a small fee and then transport it via donkey carts or pick-up trucks to their homes in Manshiyat Nasser. Once home, they sort the garbage for recyclable material. The collecting of the trash is traditionally the men’s work, while women and children sort the garbage. Although antiquated on its face, the efficiency of the recycling system of the Zabbaleen is remarkable. Almost 90 percent of the garbage is recycled, which is four times the percentage most Western recycling companies produce. Living conditions are poor in Manshiyat Nasser and the living situation is unsurprisingly unhealthy. But during the last years, the lives of the Zabbaleen have gotten worse as a result of two decisions of the Cairo municipal government. In 2003 the government hired private companies for the garbage disposal, which today the Zabbaleen have to compete against. Six years later, in a preventive measure against the threat of an outbreak of the swine flu, the Cairo government ordered the culling of all 350,000 pigs in Manshiyat Nasser. Traditionally, pigs have always been an important factor in the lives of the Zabbaleen, since they cleared the garbage of all organic waste and their meat was later sold to hotels and restaurants catering to non-Muslim tourists. The village has received much attention following the release of the 2009 documentary film Garbage Dreams, which won the Al Gore Reel Current Award. Since the release of the film, Manshiyat Nasser has become something of an off-the-beaten-path tourist attraction for adventuresome individuals.","Manshiyat Nasser, Moqattam Hills"
36,Mit Ghamr Dovecotes,"Madinet Mit Ghamr, Egypt",Giant pigeon houses packed into city streets in Egypt.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gahmr-delta,"Packed tightly against each other and stretching higher than many buildings around them, brown, earthen dovecotes or pigeon houses fill many Egyptian cities. In the Nile delta at Mit Ghamr, hundreds of dovecotes stand erect like earthen chimneys along many streets and are used for farming pigeons. Constructed out of mud brick, the Egyptian dovecote is an extremely common sight across the country and is especially prevalent in Mit Ghamr. Although pigeons have been known as pests, and rats with wings in many Western cities, in Egypt they are considered useful, and are farmed in urban areas through the use of the dovecote. Throughout Egypt, not only are the pigeons consumed as food, their droppings are also considered a valuable fertilizer. In a country with little arable land, the bizarre dovecotes are a crucial part of urban planning, and feeding a nation of 80 million people.",
37,Citadel of Saladin,"Cairo, Egypt",The medieval center of the Islamic world was also once the seat of Saladin's sultanate.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/citadel-of-saladin,"An-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub, more commonly referred to as Saladin, is one of the most notable and significant figures in the history of the Middle Ages. From his wise rule to intense warfare with Christian crusaders, his reputation is well respected in both the western and Islamic worlds. Ruling a wide area extending from Syria to parts of the Maghreb, the seat of Saladin’s sultanate was the desert city of Cairo, where he constructed a magnificent citadel that would continue to be Egypt’s political center until the mid-19th century. The Citadel of Saladin, known colloquially in English as the Cairo Citadel, is strategically located on a promontory beneath the Mokattam Mountain that made it difficult to attack. It was considered the most impressive and ambitious military fortification at the time of its construction. Subsequent Islamic rulers of the Mamluk Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire, al-Nasir Muhammad and Muhammad Ali Pasha respectively, redeveloped and installed additional defenses. Thanks to (or in spite of) this elaborate fortification, Cairo was never subjected to a siege, and therefore, the Citadel has never fallen in history. One of the citadel’s historically significant features is a relief depicting an Egyptian vulture that can be seen on its western wall. Although headless today, it’s believed to have been originally a double-headed eagle, a motif often found in the contemporary Islamic world, from architecture to coinage. While the symbol is called the Eagle of Saladin, the relief’s exact date is unknown and its creation could be later than the time of Saladin. Nevertheless, this “eagle” was redesigned and used as a national symbol following the Egyptian revolution of 1952 and is still employed as Egypt’s official coat-of-arms. Until 1983, the Citadel was used as a military garrison by occupying British forces and later by the Egyptian army. It first opened to the public following UNESCO’s designation of it as part of the World Heritage Site, Historic Cairo. Today the site contains multiple Ottoman-era mosques and museums dedicated to the military, police, and historical carriages. The structure also offers amazing views of Cairo and the desert beyond.",
38,Cave of Swimmers,"Al Wahat Al Dakhla Desert, Egypt","A hyper-remote desert cave dramatized in ""The English Patient.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cave-of-swimmers,"The 1996 film The English Patient, based on Michael Ondaatje’s book, bears a rather loose resemblance to the life and times of the real-life László Almásy. Between the World Wars, this intrepid Hungarian desert explorer and, later, Axis collaborator, did indeed find a cave in southwest Egypt’s hyper-remote Gilf Kebir plateau. This is a corner of the Sahara that’s so arid and little-visited that the plateau itself had only been discovered a few years earlier. The cave, in a natural amphitheater called Wadi Surah, improbably depicts what could be interpreted as playful swimming figures from a time when the Sahara was much less arid. Almásy’s later book recalling his desert adventures was called Swimmers in the Desert. The real cave is nothing like the dramatic cavern in the movie. It’s a rather ordinary, shallow scoop at the base of an outcrop. It does feature rock art that is thought to be 8,000 years old, but the tiny swimming figures that have survived the millennia are much degraded. There are far more impressive and equally enigmatic galleries of prehistoric rock art nearby in the Gilf, as well the valleys radiating from the Jebel Uwienat massif, a hundred miles to the south, where the borders of Sudan and Libya meet.","It was never easy to reach Gilf Kebir, and other parts of the Libyan Desert in Egypt have been off-limits to tourists for some time. That is unlikely to change soon."
39,Nabta Playa Stone Circle,"Aswan, Egypt",This North African stone complex is considered to be the oldest astronomical observatory on Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nabta-playa-stone-circle,"In the eyes of Western civilization, Stonehenge reigns supreme in the category of famous stone circles. With its megaliths meticulously displayed, this 5,000-year-old prehistoric monument and World Heritage site garners over a million visitors per year. To many, it is the prime example of the mysteries that still remain unsolved. But more than 2,000 miles away, in southern Egypt, lies another stone complex that archeologists believe predates Stonehenge by almost 2,000 years: Nabta Playa. Located around 700 miles south of the Great Pyramid of Giza and some 60 miles west of the Nile, Nabta Playa is said to have been constructed by a cattle-worshiping cult who used it to mark the summer solstice and the arrival of the monsoons. There are two versions of the story of how these megaliths were discovered. The first one comes from a Bedouin (nomadic Arab) named Eide Mariff who says he came across the stones while crossing the Sahara in 1973. He then took his colleague, prominent American archaeologist Fred Wendorf, out to the site. But Wendorf’s longtime friend and collaborator Romuald Schild remembers the story slightly differently. Schild says that also in 1973, he, Wendorf, and a team of archaeologists were driving across the desert and spotted the stone remains when they stopped for a bathroom break. The megalith monuments and stone slabs of Nabta Playa were constructed over years of habitation by the nomadic people who passed through the area over thousands of years. The most significant structure amongst them all is the calendar stone circle. The circle is made up of four pairs of large stones and then an assortment of smaller stones. Wendorf, Schild, and the team of archeological excavators believed that the stones were aligned with the stars in some way. In research published in 2007 about the complex of stones, archaeoastronomers and archaeologists confirmed that the stones were in possible alignment with the stars Sirius and Arcturus, the star system Alpha Centauri, and the Belt of Orion. After the first study of the site was published in 1998, tourists and visitors who were able to locate the stone circles began defacing the stones and moving some, eventually changing the alignment. The area had been untouched for over 5,000 years before then. Now, the stones (including a cow sculpture!) can be seen in their original formation at the Nubian Museum in Aswan, Egypt, where visitors can view the historic monument from a safe distance.",

41,King Jamaica Restaurant and Cafe,"Aswan, Egypt",This eatery is emblematic of the connection between Jamaica and Nubia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/king-jamaica-restaurant-and-cafe,"Picture this: You’re drinking fresh hibiscus juice in a restaurant overlooking the water while jerk chicken sizzles on the grill and a reggae track plays. You feel like you’re in Jamaica, but you’re not. You’re in Aswan, Egypt, dining alongside the Nile River. King Jamaica Restaurant serves a fusion of Nubian and Jamaican cuisine. Nubians, an indigenous population in Southern Egypt, are descendants of one of the world’s oldest civilizations, and their food is a historic art. Even so, Nubians hold a close connection to the African diaspora, and cross-community migration influences the region’s food and culture. Notably, Rastafarianism and reggae, popularized by Bob Marley in the late ’60s and ’70s, motivated a generation of Nubians to connect with Jamaican culture. Today, in Aswan, it’s common to see Jamaican flags flying at half mast on boats traveling down the Nile. Marley’s music continues to reverberate throughout the city, and restaurants merging Jamaican and Nubian flavors have become a marker of cultural continuity. King Jamaica, owned and operated by Aymen Jamaica, is a premiere example of this cross-cultural collaboration. Aymen’s grandfather lived in Jamaica and brought back recipes and stories about his time there. Aymen, a Nubian chef who lived in Australia, returned home to open up a restaurant true to his grandfather’s vision. Today, King Jamaica is both a restaurant and a community center, where artists from across the African diaspora perform, mingle, and eat. The menu includes camel-meat tagine, a Nubian delicacy paired with jerk chicken off the grill, as well as stuffed pigeon and fresh hibiscus and mango juices made with locally grown fruit.","King Jamaica is on Elephantine Island, a Nubian village on the Nile off the coast of Aswan.

42,New Gourna Village,"Al Qarnah, Egypt","There are ongoing efforts to preserve this village, the best known work of Egyptian architect Hasan Fathy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-gourna-village,"In the 20th century, Egyptian architect Hasan Fathy became well known for his work rooted in traditional craftsmanship. Instead of following the modernist works of his contemporaries, Fathy wanted to develop a style of architecture rooted in local traditions and built with local materials.He called it “architecture for the poor,” and even wrote a book of the same name. One of Fathy’s most famous projects was New Gourna Village near Luxor, Egypt. Designed and built between 1946 and 1952, the village was conceived as a settlement for people who had been displaced from Old Gourna Village, which stands in the middle of archeological sites of the Luxor Necropolis. The goal of the experimental village was to use local materials and techniques to relocate the community living near the ancient sites, both to limit damage and looting as well as facilitate tourism. Fathy used earthen building materials throughout the village. Architectural elements common in the old village, such as enclosed courtyards, vaulted ceilings, and perforated walls, were incorporated in the design. Sadly, political and financial complications plagued the project, and many of the residents of Old Gourna were opposed to relocation. The project was never formally completed. Today, many of the Fathy’s original buildings have been lost. In 2009, concerns about the village’s degraded state led UNESCO to establish a project with the goal of safeguarding this piece of architectural history.",
43,Samir Lama Memorials,Egypt,Scattered monuments in the middle of the Sahara dedicated to the late Egyptian actor and desert explorer.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/samir-lama-memorials,"In southwestern Egypt, in the endless stretches of the Sahara Desert, there lies one of the most difficult scavenger hunts in the world. Dotted throughout the ceaseless swaths of sand are various memorials dedicated to the late Egyptian actor Samir Lama, placed throughout the Sahara at unsuspecting locations. Samir Lama was an Egyptian actor known for his roles in Egyptian films such as Storm over Petra, The Treasure of Happiness, and Valley of Death, most of which were shot in the deserts of southwestern Egypt. Lama was also a desert explorer, credited for discovering what is now known as Lama-Monod Pass in southwestern Egypt with his colleague, Théodore Monod. After Lama’s death in 2004, his wife, Walli, and a group of friends placed their memorials in the most fitting location possible: in the middle of the Sahara, at Lama-Monod Pass itself. Located on the remote Gilf Kebir Plateau (translating to “The Great Barrier Plateau”) miles away from any civilization, there are multiple memorials to Samir Lama, hidden from plain sight and often covered by sand.","The Mirador point to see one of these is 23.504296°, 25.602089°.

44,Muzawaka Tombs,"Qesm Al Wahat Ad Dakhlah, Egypt",The forgotten mummies of Dakhla oasis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/muzawaka-tombs,"The ancient tombs of Petosiris and Sadosiris, which were discovered in 1972, used to be the star attraction of the Muzawaka necropolis. But too much fresh air and humidity from the breath of the visitors have threatened the state of the colourful frescoes inside the mausolea, and the tombs have been closed for several years. Locals can nevertheless make a visit to the burial site worthwhile (perhaps even more worthwhile), since they can guide visitors to several open rock-cut tombs which are literally littered with various mummified corpses. In every other country these mummies would probably be proudly displayed at a museum, but given Egypt’s over-abundance of mummies, the Muzawaka corpses have been categorized as being of no significant value to archaeologists and have been left in situ. While many of the rock-cut tombs contain mummified corpses, others hold skeletal remains or wildly strewn bones, probably because these corpses may have been dug up by wild animals. Skeletal remains and bones can also be found littering the mountainside of the tabletop mountain, where the necropolis is located. The mummies date from the Roman period in Egypt and are mostly clustered in family tombs. They belonged to non-wealthy residents, hence the undecorated interior of their tomb chambers. It is one of Egypt’s most macabre “tourist sights,” and one of the very few places in the world where non-scientists have the possibility of getting so close to mummies in their original resting places that they can even touch them.",Between Deir al-Hagar and al-Qasr; Dakhla Oasis; New Valley Governorate; Egypt
45,Ureka,"San Antonio de Ureca, Equatorial Guinea",This village surrounded by breathtaking waterfalls is one of the wettest places on earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ureka,"From the moment you get out of your car and see that first waterfall tumbling down the cliff until you’re swimming beneath another waterfall deep within the jungle, you know you’re somewhere special. A two-hour drive to the south of Bioko Island, Ureka is a hidden world. Seeing that first waterfall you might wonder if you should bother to go any further. You could spend the day right there, like the locals do, on the beach, barbecuing and paddling in the waves. Or, you could take a walk. You’ll need to start early. Bring plenty of water and sun protection. It’s hot. The beach is completely exposed. But if you walk for about an hour along the deserted, black sand beach, you’ll find waterfall number two. Hidden in the jungle, it spills into a pool perfect for swimming and fishing. You might wonder again if you should go on. You could just spend your day here, wallowing in the cool water. Keep going. Deeper into the jungle. There is a path, but things grow fast here and it can be difficult to find. Thirty minutes of thrashing through the trees, scrambling up and over fallen logs, until you arrive at the sand of a tiny private beach. You’ll need to cross a river here. The tide can be high. The current strong. The water may reach up to your neck so you’ll need to carry your backpack over your head. Wear water shoes if you can—the stones on the riverbed are brutal. Continue upstream along the low rocky river you’ve just crossed. Suddenly, you’ve made it. Waterfall number three. A gushing, wide mouth, cascading into the river that you’ve just crossed. Taking a dip is recommended. Or hang out on the grass nearby, listen and watch. There is nobody else around. You might think this is it. You’ve already walked so far. What could possibly be more rewarding, more special than this? Don’t give up now. Back down the river. Along the sand and around the corner. During the dry season, you might encounter a group of students from Drexel University. They camp out in the jungle for months at a time, studying the giant turtles that nest on the beach. They’ll appreciate it if you bring them some treats. Living this remotely, they don’t get much opportunity to restock their supplies. Finally, hidden just beyond their camp, there it is: waterfall number four. Tumbling down from the cliff into a large beautiful pool. Like something out of a fantasy novel. Something truly from another world. And at the end of the day, damp and tired, you’ll make your way back through the jungle. Walking along the majestic black sand beach, as the afternoon waves crash onto the shore, you’ll marvel at how fortunate you are to be one of the few people in the world to experience such a magical place.","You will need to acquire a permit from the authorities in order to access Ureka. You may be asked to show your permit at the village nearby. It is recommended to use a local tourism operator to apply for the permit on your behalf. You will need to supply your passport details for the permit to be granted and pay a fee. If driving yourself, make sure you have a decent 4WD vehicle and the driver is competent and comfortable with steep roads. Although the road is asphalt all the way, the roads are very steep–many, many brake pads have been totally burnt out by this road, and there is no cell reception, so you want to avoid a situation where you might need to call for help! Bring a backpack with a hat, sunscreen, bug spray, food, and plenty of water. It’s a full day out and there’s nowhere to buy additional food. Check the tide times beforehand so you can plan your trip. The tides can get quite high, the currents are strong and you will likely need to cross rivers in chest-deep water."
46,Playa de Arena Blanca,"Luba, Equatorial Guinea","During the dry season, this white-sand beach hosts thousands of breeding butterflies.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/playa-de-arena-blanca,"Playa de Arena Blanca is a stunning white sand beach on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea. But that’s not the only reason to visit. During the dry season between December and February, thousands of butterflies populate the beach to breed. The spectacle is known to create dense “clouds” of butterflies. Bioko Island is the largest volcanic island in the Gulf of Guinea, located 100 miles northwest of Equatorial Guinea’s coast and 60 miles from the southern coast of Nigeria. In the native Bube language, the island is called Ëtulá Ëria. Much of its landscape is dominated by tropical rainforests and steep mountains. That landscape supports a diverse population of plants and animals. The island is home to more than 200 species of birds, and its beaches are a breeding ground for four species of sea turtles. Interestingly, a 1994 analysis found that Bioko has fewer endemic species (plants and animals found nowhere else) than the nearby islands of São Tomé and Príncipe. These other islands in the Gulf of Guinea have been isolated for much longer, while Bioko was connected to the African mainland until about 10,000 years ago. Bioko also has some of the greatest butterfly diversity in the world. In 2000, 172 different butterfly species were recorded on the 779-square-mile island, and researchers continue to learn more about the fluttering insects that call this island home. In 2015, researchers identified three new species on the island that sport some extraordinarily cool names: the striped policeman (Coeliades forestan), the silky dart (Semalea pulvina), and the forest sylph (Ceratrichia phocion camerona).","Playa de Arena Blanca is about an hour’s drive south of Equatorial Guinea's capital, Malabo."
47,Pico Basilé,"Malabo, Equatorial Guinea","It's been nearly a century since this volcano, the tallest mountain in Equatorial Guinea, erupted.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pico-basile,"Standing 3,011 meters (9,878 feet) tall, Pico Basilé is the volcano king of Bioko Island. The summit of the shield volcano, which last erupted in 1923, is often hidden by clouds. You might catch a glimpse of its peak, but the full extent of its grandeur will only appear on a clear, cloudless day. And clear, cloudless days don’t tend to happen that much around here. In the dry season, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that Pico Basilé is even there, lurking quietly behind a wall of dust. Late November to early March is when the annual phenomenon known as Harmattan occurs, in which sand from the Sahara Desert blows across the sea. It coats the island in dust so thick that visibility is reduced to not much more than 50 meters (160 feet). Your best bet for a full Pico viewing is after a rainstorm. As soon as the rain has washed away the clouds (or the dust), finally Pico will appear in all its glory, presiding majestically over Equatorial Guinea’s capital city of Malabo. Pico Basilé is the tallest mountain in Equatorial Guinea. It’s a volcano. And it’s there. So of course you want to stand on the top. After all, isn’t that what mountains are for? If you want to reach the top, you have three options: Driving up the paved road in the comfort of an air-conditioned vehicle (preferably one with four-wheel drive); Cycling up on your fancy road bike; Walking up (but probably not back down). The road is asphalt and surprisingly well-maintained, but it is, horrendously steep. Don’t be fooled by those 10 percent gradient road signs. If you’re driving, make sure your driver knows how to drive a stick and is comfortably staying in first gear—especially on the way back down. The fact that the road is well-maintained, and not heavily trafficked, can also make it an enticing challenge for keen cyclists. But again with the steepness. Even the most experienced hill-climbing cyclists will find they need to step off and walk in certain sections. If you choose to walk, remember that this road was made for vehicles, not hiking. You will be walking 30 kilometers, straight up. And there aren’t a lot of views along the way. And there is certainly no guarantee of a view at the top. (You might just find yourself surrounded by a chilly cloud.) Let’s be frank—it’s likely that you won’t see much more than a telecommunications tower and a couple of security guards at the top. But remember—it’s about the journey, not the destination! Right? Or you could just wait for a rainstorm and admire the view from sea level.","As with most tourist attractions in EG, you will need a permit. You need to apply, pay for it and receive a copy ahead of time. The road is about 30km up. If driving, make sure your driver is comfortable with being in first gear and can recognize the smell of burning brake pads. If you’re walking up, arrange a ride for the trip down. Walking 30km straight up asphalt takes about 6 hours and it hurts. It’s not worth walking back down. Take plenty of water and snacks. A support vehicle is a good idea if you can arrange it. Take a sweatshirt or jacket for the top. Don’t be deceived by the humidity down below. It’s chilly up there. The security guards at the peak may want to see your permit. They also appreciate token gifts like soft drinks, etc. Their shifts up there are long."
48,Catedral de Santa Isabel,"Malabo, Equatorial Guinea",The largest Christian church in the country is a complicated symbol of Spanish colonialism.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/catedral-de-santa-isabel,"On a quiet square nestled along a seaside harbor stands a towering cathedral with a peach-colored facade and two soaring, 130-foot-tall towers. Construction on Catedral de Santa Isabel began while Equatorial Guinea was still under Spanish colonial rule in 1887. The church was then consecrated in 1916. Local practitioners, businesses, and the Spanish government all came together to fund the massive building project. The Spanish architect Llairadó Luis Segarra was eventually commissioned to design the Gothic revival church and the famous Catalan architect Antonio Gaudí even weighed in on the church’s design. While many people associate Spanish colonialism with the Americas, Equatorial Guinea was Spain’s last colony to gain independence in 1968. Equatorial Guinea’s capital, Malabo, and the Catedral de Santa Isabel within it rest on Bioko island’s northern coast. But in the 15th century, Portuguese explorers completed a survey of the island and called it Fernando Po, after the expedition’s leader. For centuries, Indigenous Africans, especially the Bubis, expelled colonialists from the island with guerilla warfare and their knowledge of the island’s dense landscape. The southern part of the island even became a haven for people who had escaped from enslavement on nearby Portuguese-controlled islands like São Tomé and Príncipe. One Spanish traveler in the 1780s said these runaways created “a republic that is governed by its own laws.” It was only later in the 19th century that Spain began building up Bioko island with construction projects like the cathedral. At times, Spain forcibly shipped free people of color from Cuba to the island to bolster the population. Spain also systematically attacked the Bubis, targeting their religion and social systems as disease and Spanish attacks reduced their population from 30,000 in 1820 to 10,000 in 1911. Today there’s still a lot of Spanish influence in Equatorial Guinea. The country’s official language is Spanish and Spanish food and restaurants can be found throughout the country. Approximately 87 percent of Equatorial Guinea’s population is Catholic, one of the highest proportions per capita in any African nation. While many praise Catedral de Santa Isabel as a beautiful example of Spanish colonial architecture, it stands today as a complicated symbol of Spanish colonialism in the country.",
