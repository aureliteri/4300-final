0,Spreepark,"Berlin, Germany","An eerie, derelict amusement park in Berlin.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spreepark,"The Spreepark in southeastern Berlin has been abandoned since 2002, and it looks like it. Each part of the park is scattered with remnants from the previous three decades, making a hodgepodge of bizarre entertainment, children’s rides, and life-size dinosaur statues. Originally constructed by the socialist government of East Germany in 1969 as the VEB Kulturpark Plänterwald, the “Kulti” stood until the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years later. It thrived throughout the communist era with 1.7 million visitors annually. The controversial amusement park operator Norbert Witte took it over in 1991, renaming the park “Spreepark.” He replaced the primarily asphalted surface with a grass and water landscape and installed a number of rides which he bought from the insolvency of the Mirapolis amusement park near Paris and moved to Berlin. Witte changed the scenery multiple times, even adding an English village. Unbeknownst to police and Berliners, Witte had also become involved in smuggling cocaine, concealing it in pieces of ride equipment shipped between Peru and Germany during his time as park administrator. Due partly to his criminal activities and due partly to lackluster visitor numbers, Spreepark was shut down to the public in 2002, and Witte was tried on smuggling charges two years later. The result of this shutdown was the amusement park which has slowly fallen into dereliction and has been taken over by nature. The whole park was featured in the film “Hanna,” and the main sites are prominent in the film’s climax. A number of features were destroyed in a fire in 2014 which was caused by arson, following which security was strengthened with a new perimeter fence and permanent security personnel and dogs.  In 2016 the site was taken over by the company Grün Berlin GmbH, owned by the City of Berlin, with the objective of transforming the site into a location for arts and culture.  Plans were proposed in late 2018 and are being considered for implementation in several years. As of May 2019, many of the previous attractions of the park have been removed.  However, the Ferris wheel and the “Fresswürfel” restaurant from the “Kulti” period remain, as do the “Spreeblitz” rollercoaster, the “Cinema 2000,” the facade of the English village, the cup carousel, and the artificial rock of the “Grand Canyon” wild water ride from Norbert Witte’s Spreepark period.  Tours are offered on weekends through August by the city for five euros. Tickets can be purchased on Ticketscript by going through the Grün Berlin website. (this website link is not working anymore) The park is accessible from Berlin city center via S-Bahn (S8 or S9) to Plänterwald station.",abandoned amusement parks dinosaurs shops abandoned ruins architectural oddities animals architecture
1,Rakotzbrücke Devil's Bridge,"Gablenz, Germany",This jaw-dropping 19th-century bridge uses its reflection to form what appears to be a perfect circle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rakotzbrucke-devils-bridge,"Nestled among the verdant foliage in Kromlau, Germany’s Kromlauer Park, is a delicately arched devil’s bridge known as the Rakotzbrücke, which was specifically built to create a circle when it is reflected in the waters beneath it. Commissioned in 1860 by the knight of the local town, the thin arch stretching over the waters of the Rakotzsee is roughly built out of varied local stone. Like many similarly precarious spans across Europe, the Rakotzbrücke is known as a “devil’s bridge,” due to the colloquialism that such bridges were so dangerous or miraculous that they must have been built by Satan. While the bridge (as with all the others) was created by mortal hands, its builders did seem to hold the aesthetics of the bridge in higher regard than its utility. Either end of the Rakotzbrücke is decorated with thin rock spires created to look like natural basalt columns, which occur in many places in Germany. In addition, the curvature of the bridge is designed to be one half of a perfect circle, so that when the waters are still and the light is right, it creates the illusion of a complete stone circle. Today, the bridge can still be viewed in the park, but crossing the aging relic is prohibited in order to preserve it. Update as of August 2019: the bridge is under construction and the lake has been drained. Update as of May 2021: the construction works are finished as of May 21st, 2021  The bridge is best visited during the fall when the foliage adds an element of wonder to the already surreal view. This bridge is located in Kromlauer Park in Eastern Germany and is best accessed by driving. While viewing the bridge is welcome, crossing the bridge is strictly prohibited. As of June 2018, the bridge was reported as being under renovation.",devils bridge optical illusions optical oddities ao loves halloween 2022 bridges
2,Berliner Unterwelten (Subterranean Berlin),"Berlin, Germany",A tour of underground Berlin takes you through WWII air raid shelters and tunnels used to smuggle people out of East Germany.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berliner-unterwelten-subterranean-berlin,"It’s a strange feeling to come into a dark, half-blasted bunker, see parts of stairways and cables hanging out of the wall and walk through rubble in between holes that go several meters down into the ground. It’s eye-opening to crouch down in an air raid bunker and experience how it must have felt when the situation was for real. These are just a couple of examples of the unique experiences offered at Berliner Unterwelten (Subterranean Berlin). The museum offers tours of some of Berlin’s most important underground structures, such as bunkers, abandoned subway stations, air raid shelters dating back to World War II and tunnels for smuggling people out of East Germany during the Cold War. Berliner Unterwelten was founded in 1997 to explore, document and preserve the city’s subterranean architecture. The organization’s base is in a former air raid bunker in the Gesundbrunnen subway station, now a museum—the Unterwelten Museum (Subterranean Museum)—that offers various tours through Berlin’s underground.  The bunker was cleared and reconstructed by the group and transformed into a museum while maintaining its original character. Hiding on four floors below Berlin are dozens of bunkers, tunnels, walkways, canals, the route of a pneumatic postal system, storage rooms, bomb and ammunition storage, and abandoned subway stations. Berlin, so full of history above ground, has a lot to tell in its subterranean areas as well. There are exhibits about everything from air raid bunkers to the removal of rubble from the destruction during World War II. Berliner Unterwelten found a huge file system about slave workers during the war in a forgotten bunker, helped the former workers to receive reparation pay and have an exhibition about slave workers in Berlin. Found objects such as ammunition, grenades, gas masks, etc. are on display as well. There is an exhibition about Hitler’s “Germania,” his utopian vision to rebuild Berlin. (The exhibition shows that the project was not, of course, a utopia after all.) Berliner Unterwelten also works to preserve subterranean areas. They have dug and cleared out many locations, including half-destroyed bunkers, and opened them to the public. Several different tours are offered, including underground bunker hospitals, mother-and-child bunkers, flak bunkers, subterranean factories, examples of subterranean escape routes from East to West Berlin, flak towers, an underground prison, Cold War bunkers for nuclear war and a tour through the Schwerbelastungskörper, a heavy tower built to test the possibilities of erecting Germania on the sandy ground of Berlin.  Berlin Underworlds tickets must be purchased in advance and in person. Tickets ordered online can be paid using credit cards. Several different tours are offered almost every day of the year as well. For more information about this, check the website of the association, which is available in many languages. Most of the exhibitions and tours are not barrier-free and also not offered to small children. The best thing is to call and ask, when you have decided on a visit or tour. Most tours cannot be booked online. The tickets have to be bought on the day the tour is offered. Tours are booked out fast. If you decide on a tour it would be best to be at their ticket office about one hour before they open and get in line.Special tours of other subjects are offered throughout the year. All the tours are offered in several different languages.",bunkers subways subterranean tunnels military history subterranean sites military museums history
3,Monster Kabinett,"Berlin, Germany","Part art gallery, part haunted house, this robotic art display is a terrifying experience.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monster-kabinett,"The Monster Kabinett is a wonderland (so to speak) of massive robotic creatures, clanking metal sculptures and insect-like beasts. In short, it lives up to its unsettling name. Created and maintained by an art collective known as the Dead Pigeon Collective, the Monster Kabinett is a warehouse full of strange art and costumed revelers, all waiting to put on a show each Thursday and Friday night. Good luck trying to figure out which creations are human and which are simply moving metal masterpieces. Visitors are confronted with the stuff of nightmares, from skittering arachnoid robots to leering, malformed sculptures to aggressive actors straight out of a haunted house. Except this haunting is year-round. The journey to the Monster Kabinett is a fitting one as well, down a dank alley off of a bustling city street. Most patrons are unsure of whether they’ve reached the right location until they’re directly in front of it, often greeted by a good-natured but somewhat off-key member of the collective. The gallery is safe, of course, but built to instill and inspire as much fright and dread as possible. And rest assured, the Dead Pigeon Collective does that part very well. The Monster Kabinett better seen than heard, which is why their website is built as more of a tour than a repository of dry information. And really, what information about the gallery is necessary? It’s best left a mystery until you experience it first-hand. Update June 2018: The museum/collection is open Wednesdays through Saturdays with hourly tours.",amazing automata monsters strange science outsider art collections museums and collections
4,Liquidrom,"Berlin, Germany",This futuristic German spa allows visitors to float in a pool of salt water while zoning out to underwater techno.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/liquidrom,"Resembling a surreal crown, the exterior of the Tempodrom, where the Liquidrom spa is located, looks like something straight out of a science fiction novel. The hi-tech delights within don’t disappoint either. The complex is built to look like an abstract tent structure, the site once served as a massive train station circa World War II, where buskers would perform where they pleased. Inside the ultra-modern structure, any remnant of those locomotive days are gone, however, they have been replaced with top of the line spa facilities made of clean lines and comfortable contours. The Liquidrom is outfitted with a variety of saunas and baths, as well as clean, new changing facilities. However, all of these standard relaxation options pale in comparison to the crown jewel of the spa’s crown, the large saltwater floating pool. Surrounded by large arches, the dimly lit pool is brought to life by multi-colored lights and music that is meant to be heard under the water. From classical to techno, the music and lights run different programs that can be checked on the website. While the goal of the pool is to promote relaxation, the overall effect looks like something straight out of dreamscape.",underwater week pools science fiction architectural oddities architecture
5,Berlin Botanical Garden,"Berlin, Germany","Started as a kitchen garden, now the second largest botanical garden in the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berlin-botanical-garden,"Established as a kitchen garden in 1679, the Botanical Garden in Berlin is the second largest botanical garden in the world, second only to Kew Gardens, located in England. The garden evolved from a kitchen garden growing vegetables and hops for beer brewing to a “considerable plant assemblage,” and in 1879 the Royal Botanical Museum was founded, encompassing every area of botany. The sheer size of the gardens and the lush density of the plant life is overwhelming, especially when taking into account that so many of these plants are endangered in their natural habitats. What grows strong and vibrant in this collection is often threatened with extinction elsewhere. This assembly of gardens, sixteen greenhouses, and landscapes exhibit a microcosm of nature’s diversity, home to flowering vines, rock cliff waterfalls, timber bamboo reaching to the sky, and a carpet of ferns, orchids, and bromeliads at your feet. The Victoria House delivers a proper tropical environment with sweltering humidity that the orchids and lilies love, a bamboo bridge that transports you over the basin and into an exotic plant paradise. With 43 hectares and close to 22,000 plant species, one visit won’t even come close to allowing you to see everything. Make sure you make the most of your day there and don’t miss the Great Pavillion, which at 20 meters high and 30x60 meters in floor area is the largest glasshouse in the world. Other must-see displays include the giant water lilies, carnivorous plant specimens, and a small cemetery, located to the left of the greenhouse complex when coming from access at the Königin-Luise-Platz. Keep a lookout for the sarcophagus of Friedrich Althoff, a university tutor deceased in 1908, which consists of a dolorous female figure meant to represent science in mourning. Also of interest, but currently not open to the public (or anyone for that matter) is a series of tunnels built near the Botanical Gardens in WWII. Entrance to the bunker was through two tunnels leading from the farm of the botanical garden. Built for the SS to house personnel and files during air raids, after the war the entrances were blown up, and the tunnels now serve as a winter roost for bats.",horticulture natural history plants
6,Neuschwanstein Castle,"Schwangau, Germany","The fairy tale castle of the ""fairy-tale king.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/neuschwanstein-castle,"Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland, Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom and numerous other magical castles were all inspired by a real castle: Neuschwanstein Castle, the awe-inspiring retreat of the “fairy-tale king,” Ludwig II of Bavaria. Commissioned by the king in homage to Richard Wagner, the fantastical castle was designed by theatrical set designer Christian Jank. The beautiful design was to further enhance the already romantic mountain and forest scenery. The first stone of Neuschwanstein Castle (which literally means, “New Swan Stone palace”) was laid in September 1869. The technology used to build this castle was considered modern and advanced. New inventions such as electricity, plumbing, heat and steamboats were used in the construction of the castle, and Ludwig himself was considered responsible for the introduction of many of these inventions to the area. In 1886, as the massively expensive castle neared completion, the State Commissioner pronounced Ludwig insane and arrested him soon after. The day after he was arrested, Ludwig requested the Commissioner go on a walk in the woods with him. The commissioner agreed and told his guards to stay behind. Both were found mysteriously dead in a lake later that evening. Ludwig was never able to see the finalized castle—and it didn’t receive its name until after his death—but his taste for elegant, and extravagant, design resonates throughout the interior of the Romanesque-style castle. After his death, the castle was opened for the public to help pay off the expenses. During World War II, the castle was appropriated and used by German forces as a depot to store all of the plundered art from France and other Nazi-occupied countries in Europe. At the close of the war, the Nazis contemplated blowing the castle up with explosives to prevent the encroaching allied forces from discovering the scale of their art looting. However, fortunately, the plan was never implemented. Today, the castle is one of the biggest attractions in Bavaria and manages to draw well over a million people a year. Of particular delight is the Grotto Room, an artificial cave complete with stalactites and a waterfall; it was intended to represent a cave from Wagner’s opera “Tannhauser.” Ironically, Wagner never stepped foot in the castle.  Most people take the train from Munich; once you arrive at the station, a bus or taxi can be taken to Hohenschwangau where the castle's ticketing office is located. You're given a block of time for your tour, so you may need to kill some time first in the small town at the base of the castle. From there, you can either hike to the top or pay for a horse-drawn carriage ride up the mountain. If you plan on doing the former, comfortable footwear is recommended. Because of it's popularity, it is strongly advised that you purchase your tickets in advanced, especially if you are short on time or visiting during high season. Luggage, large rucksacks, and strollers are not allowed. There are some lockers at the castle, but storing these items prior to your visit is recommended. The castle does provide services for persons with limited mobility.

7,Tajikistan Tearoom,"Berlin, Germany",A slice of central Asia in the middle of Berlin.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tajikistan-tearoom,"Tajikistan tearoom is an unexpected slice of central Asia in the midst of Berlin. The tearoom was built as a Tajikistan pavilion at one of the Leipzig trade fairs in the 1970s. After the trade fair ended, the pavilion was donated by the Soviet Republic of Tajikistan to their East German hosts. The tearoom’s lush interior is decorated entirely in a classical Persian style, with carved wooden pillars and thick Persian carpets. Tea and food are served on low wooden tables which are typical of central Asia. Guests sit on the floor, stretched out on comfortable cushions, and visitors are required to take their shoes off before stepping onto the carpet. Like the country for which it was named, the Tajikistan tearoom is a place where Persian and Russian cultures mix. An old map of Soviet tourist resorts hangs above the counter. And while the selection of tea is oriental, the food on offer is Russian, and a silver Russian samovar - a metal container used for heating water - sits in one corner. The pavilion once lived inside Berlin’s Palais am Festungsgraben, but has since moved to a new home in the KunstHof, a courtyard lined with galleries and cafes. Still somewhat hidden from most tourists — the Tajikistan tearoom is an excellent place to get refreshed in the Russian summer.  Is almost opposite to the Arthouse Tacheles, hidden on the left in the courtyard (im KunstHof). phone: +49 (030) 204 11 12",Unique Restaurants & Bars
8,Pergamon Museum,"Berlin, Germany","The most visited, and possibly most controversial, museum in Germany.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pergamon-museum,"Situated on Berlin’s Museum Island, the Pergamon Museum houses original, reconstructed monumental buildings such as the Pergamon Altar and the Market Gate of Miletus. Both of these extraordinary artifacts were transported from Turkey, and since its opening in 1930, there has been controversy over the legitimacy of the acquisition of the collection. Many have suggested that the collection be returned to Turkey. When the Pergamon Museum was severely damaged during an air strike at the end of the Second World War, many objects were stolen. Although many of the major pieces were safely secured, the Red Army collected all of the loose museum items, either as war booty or for safe keeping from the looting and fires that were then raging in Berlin. In 1958, most of the objects returned to East Germany, but a few significant items of the collection simply remained in Russia. Many of them are now housed in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow and the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. While Germany is debating whether these artifacts should be returned, Russia currently has no plans to return their items to Turkey, or back to Germany. Update as of Apri 2023: The museum is closed for renovations until October 2023.",collections museums and collections museums

10,Castle Frankenstein,"Mühltal, Germany",The birthplace of an eccentric alchemist and possible inspiration for the fictional reanimator of monsters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-frankenstein,"Johann Konrad Dippel was rumored to create potions, perform electrical therapies, and partake in gruesome experiments involving stolen body parts from the graveyard. Born in the Castle Frankenstein (German: Burg Frankenstein) in 1673, it’s disputed whether or not he was the inspiration for Mary Shelley’s mad scientist of the same name, who did some cadaver experiments of his own. What is sure about Dippel is his colorful career as an alchemist. He attached his name to Dippel’s Animal Oil, which he discovered from the destructive distillation of animal parts and claimed as a universal medicine. The animal oil came at the end of a wave of popularity for Iatrochemistry, which had moved alchemy from the search for creating gold to finding new medicines. The unpleasant taste and smell, as well as the progression of medicine, made Dippel’s oil fall into disrepute by the end of the 18th-century. Dippel later helped set up a laboratory in Berlin for making gold and, at one point, he ended up in prison on a Danish island for seven years due to political activities. In 1734, he finally had a stroke and died at Castle Wittgenstein near Berleburg, although his friends claimed he was poisoned. By his own hand or that of another, it is unclear. The Castle Frankenstein is now in ruins, with only two towers, a restaurant with a vegan and kid-friendly menu, and a chapel remaining. However, the perhaps mythical connection to Mary Shelley’s novel “Frankenstein” keeps it a popular destination, especially for Halloween. In late October and early November, the Burg Frankenstein Halloween party gathers zombies, witches, werewolves, vampires, and regular visitors for scary dinners and creepy shows. A popular annual party was started there by American soldiers stationed near the castle in World War II. Until it was deactivated in 2008, the US Army’s 233rd Base Support Battalion in Darmstadt conducted an annual Frankenstein Castle run which finished at the tower. The castle was featured in an episode of Ghost Hunters International, which aired in February of 2008.

11,Stasi Museum,"Berlin, Germany",A museum dedicated to the history of a terrifying secret police is now held in their former headquarters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stasi-museum,"An inside look at the operations of one of the most feared secret police states of the 20th century. The Stasi was the GDR’s infamous secret police force. Considering itself the “shield and sword of the party” it ran a covert war against perceived enemies of the state. It was from this building that head of the Stasi, Erich Mielke, ran one of the most feared secret police forces the world has ever known. It’s estimated that one out of every 10 East Germans worked as an informant for the Stasi, and the museum shows many of the bizarre ways the totalitarian regime used to spy on its citizens. Microphones hidden inside church hymn books, wrist watches with wire taps that ran up your sleeve, one of the most peculiar methods even involved the use of sniffer dogs. This latter method involved hiding cotton squares under seat cushions, then after the suspect left their seat, the cotton square was removed from the seat and placed in an airtight jar. Dogs could then be used to track that person based on the scent they left behind. There is a special section of the museum, on the 3rd floor, dedicated to the Stasi technique of “Zersetzung” (corrosion)—the East German secret police method of dealing with problematic political dissidents by, for example, ruining their marriages, delivering pornographic material to their homes, and routinely deflating the tires on their bicycles. All in order to drive their victims to the end of their wits. The museum also highlights the Orwellian brainwashing that took place at school level; instead of cutout dolls with fashionable clothes, children of the GDR had cutout dolls with gas masks and AK-47s. Flash cards used to teach A, B, C’s featured lock picking, fingerprint taking, and camera surveillance. Look out for the painting at the head of the conference room, depicting the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, produced by the same artist (the unfortunately named Dr Frankenstein) responsible for the series of abstract political images adorning the walls of the nearby Magdalenenstrasse U-bahn. Today the odd methods the Stasi used to employ, waver between the amusing and the downright strange. But for the common people living behind the Iron Curtain, they were a ruthless, all-seeing force, the mention of which would send shivers down spines. U-bahn 5, station Magdalenenstr.",museums

Just a bit farther up the street, however, another courtyard is hidden away all on its own. Lacking a grand entryway, it can be easy to miss, but through its humble portal lies a hot spot of Berlin street art. Since street art is mercurial and chaotic by its very nature, the art on display in the alley next to Haus Schwarzenberg changes on an almost weekly basis, with new pieces being painted on, papered over, added to, and repurposed in the constantly evolving collage that washes over this little urban oasis. Famous street artists like El Bocho, Miss Van, Stinkfish, Otto Schade, and more have been known to add to the churn. The alley also features a famous painting of Anne Frank by Jimmy C that remains intact and untouched. The existence of this vibrant cultural pocket is thanks chiefly to Haus Schwarzenberg, a non-profit arts organization that occupies the building adjoining the alley. Even more artwork can be found in the stairwells and shops located in the building, so be sure to have a peek inside the doors leading off of the courtyard while you’re there.

The 80-room castle is still occupied today, and looks much as it would have hundreds of years ago. Local stories say that it is infested with the ghosts of medieval knights.

One of these was the Felsenburg Neurathen - built in the 11th Century, it dominated the landscape for 3 centuries until burned by a besieging army in 1484. Sadly there is little left of the Felsenburg Neurathen that once sat on top of the natural stone towers. Today, it is possible to visit the ruins, but what’s more spectacular is the view that the site commands. The surrounding area is so scenic that it was the site of Germany’s first landscape photography, and by 1850 the original wooden bridge had been replaced by a permanent one made of sandstone in order to accommodate the increasing tourist traffic. From the Bastei, you can look out into a wide valley where sandstone mesas rise up from the forest floor and the site itself is a gateway to various hikes throughout the park region. The region around the Bastei is also popular with rock climbers, and there are numerous free-climbing options.

15,Museum of Unheard of Things,"Berlin, Germany",A wunderkammer of mysterious objects and stories.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-unheard-of-things,"Berlin seems to be fascinated with the examination of “things.” The Museum der Dinge, a collection of everyday items devoted to modern object design, and the Design Panoptikum, a surreal museum of extraordinary industrial objects, are a couple examples. This beloved curio collection of “Unheard of Things” is further proof. The Museum of Unheard of Things is a wunderkammer of curious and evocative items. The objects in the collection are all arranged by their weight, and plastered all over the museum walls. The items themselves are not the entirely the point, though—what’s really on display is the power of imagination, for an “unheard of” story has been invented about each exhibit by the raconteur curator. Each seemingly simple object inspires a tall tale or urban myth, told in a dry and convincing way by its label - so convincing, in fact, that some museum visitors leave in awe of the “petrified water” they have seen. Read the tale of the petrified potatoes, the story behind the fur of a Bonsai deer, or the cow-pie worshipping community, or how sacramental wine lost its red color. These are just some of the myths you can learn in this unique exhibition. Located in an East Germany factory building, the museum is curated by artist Roland Albrecht, who also has a book by the same name. The idea behind both is to encourage people to pause and reassess their world view, to think about the bigger story behind the everyday things we take for granted, and to view the world through the lens of imagination.",wunderkammers design collections museums and collections museums
16,Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe,"Berlin, Germany",Thousands of coffin-like pillars make up this controversial Holocaust memorial.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memorial-to-the-murdered-jews-of-europe,"Completed on December 15, 2004, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe was built in remembrance of the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust. By pairing aesthetic minimalism and a massive scope, the memorial generates an incredibly powerful tension for its visitors. Altogether 2,711 unmarked grey concrete “stelae” or slabs cover a city block situated just south of the Brandenberg Gate. Each and every one of the stelae is identical in dimension ( 7’ 10” by 3’ 1”) and eerily reminiscent of coffins, though they vary from eight inches to over 15 feet in height. As a whole, they create a labyrinth where visitors are easily lost, contributing to a pervasive feeling of bewilderment while walking amidst the memorial’s network of open-air corridors. Since its debut, both praise and criticism have been directed at the memorial. Critics of the work at once find fault in its commemoration of a single demographic victimized by the Nazis rather than the multitude of those affected including large numbers of Europe’s Roma and homosexual populations. Still, others find the vagueness of the monument’s title disturbing, in that it avoids any assignation of blame for who, exactly, took these individual human lives. Meanwhile, architectural scholars praise its stylistic execution. As Nicolai Ouroussoff noted, Berlin’s monument avoids sentimentality in the face of an internationally affecting event, instead, “showing how abstraction can be the most powerful tool for conveying the complexities of human emotion.” All scholarly debate aside, finding a visitor who emerges unmoved by the visual impact of the installation seems unlikely.",labyrinths judaism holocaust jewish memorials

The lush 243 acre island was originally known as “Rabbit Island” thanks to a small rabbit farm that was established there in the 17th century by Frederick William I of Brandenburg. It was not until his descendant Frederick William II came around in the late 18th century and turned the island into a private getaway for he and his favorite mistress, Wilhelmine Enke. Supposedly stating, “On Rabbit Island neither the merest tree nor bush may ever be felled again!” William II began the islands existence as a natural refuge for plant and animal. He also built the island’s most iconic structure, the two-towered white castle folly for himself and Enke. The two towers are connected by a medieval-styled bridge. After William II died, his son took over the island and built, among other buildings, a menagerie that had all manner of exotic animals including crocodiles, wolves, eagles, and of course peacocks. By the mid-1940s most of the animals had been transferred to the newly built Berlin Zoo. But some of the peacocks remained, and the island remained a bit of protected natural land. Today the island can still be visited via ferry from Berlin’s Wannsee railway station. Both the ivory folly and the wild peacocks remain on the island.

Originally opened in 1987 as the Berlin Gartenschau (Berlin Garden Exhibition) it was renamed Erholungspark Marzahn (Marzahn Recreational Park) after reunification, and then to Gärten der Welt, with the construction of the park’s Chinese Gardens as part of Berlin’s partnership with the city of Beijing. The Chinese Garden is officially named “Garten des wiedergewonnenen Mondes,” or “The Garden of the Reclaimed Moon,” symbolic of Berlin’s divided past and united future. This garden consists of traditional Chinese plants and buildings, all centered around a small lake with a stone boat in it. The Chinese Gardens were followed by the Japanese Garden, “Garten des zusammenfließenden Wassers” (Garden of Confluent Waters,) complete with a small pavilion and a rock garden; the Arabian-themed Oriental Gardens, or “Garten der vier Ströme” (Garden of the Four Streams,) patterned on the palace courtyard of Riyadh; the Korean “Seouler Garten” (Seoul Garden,) covered in traditional Korean handicrafts,  and the Christian Garden, dominated by a golden cage-like structure comprised of Biblical verses and other writings in a variety of European languages, earning it the name “Raum der Sprache und des Wortes,” or “Room of Speech and Word.” The park also features a labyrinth in which one can wander their way to a small tower in the center — a fantastic vantage point not just for the labyrinth, but for a swath of the gardens. Nearby, there is a row of small statues depicting some of the less grim scenes from certain German fairytales. Finally, there are additions constantly being made to the Gärten der Welt. The Tropical Hall, Balinese Garden, and Italian Garden are being renovated, and a new English Country Garden is being built.  Take the S-Bahn line S7 going toward Ahrensfelde until the stop Marzahn.

Taco carts, hot dog stands, creperies… what better way to immerse yourself into the local culture? In the case of Berlin, Germany, at least one way to do that exists while also sounding incredibly brave (or foolish, depending) when recounting the adventures to friends and family upon returning home again. Enter: Burgermeister. The snack shack, whose name is a clever play on the German word for “mayor,” may seem to sling burgers and fries like any other joint of its ilk, but the details of Burgermeister are where the place really distinguishes itself from the pack. Located directly under the U-Bahn tracks, its utilitarian shape and dull green paint and “Männer” sign at the restaurant’s far end reveal the space’s former life as a public toilet building. Yes, you read that right. The reigning late-night, counter service burger joint of choice in Berlin is located inside an old train loo, scrubbed of all its goo. Customers take a ticket, deli-style, from a counter and wait patiently (or drunkenly, depending on the day and hour) for a busy worker, seen running hither and dither throughout the standing-room-only restaurant, to deliver their American-style treat. Burgermeister’s food has been praised by several critics, making it worthy of the bonus braggadocio you’ll add when regaling your mates of that time you ate a hamburger in a restaurant that used to be a bathroom, and lived to tell the tale. The beautiful Oberbaumbrücke nearby offers a great view of the Berlin skyline and the river Spree, get your grub to go and eat by the water for a quintessential Berlin experience. Located right next to Schlesisches Tor U-bahn station, Burgermeister is also a short walk from Warschauerstrasse Station.

And not letters as in notes sent through the post, but 3-D pieces of forgotten or abandoned signs. The Museum of Rescued Letters (Buchstabenmuseum) was established in 2005 by Barbara Dechant and Anja Schulze. What began as their personal passions for and collection of typography has grown into a museum packed with a jumble of discarded letters and signs otherwise doomed for a dumpster. Typography enthusiasts are welcome to visit the museum to browse bits of the collection. Most of the letters come from Berlin, but a few were sourced from elsewhere in Germany and beyond. Old shop signs, logos, and letters fill the space. Some are arranged by color, while others are clumped together to form an eclectic alphabet soup. Abandoned neon signs buzz and glow within the darker corners. The letters and words are more than just forgotten ghosts of cafe signs past. The museum aims to document, research, and restore the many signs scattered about to the space to preserve otherwise lost fragments of the cityscape.

22,Teufelsberg,"Berlin, Germany","An abandoned NSA listening post on Berlin's ""Devil's Mountain.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/teufelsberg,"This abandoned NSA field station sits atop an 80 meter artificial hill in the Grunewald forest on the west edge of Berlin. The hill has a noteworthy history: created from the post-WWII debris of desolated Berlin, it is higher than the highest natural hill (the Kreuzberg) in the Berlin area, believed to be created from the rubble of some 400,000 buildings. Buried deep within the hill a building still stands, once a Nazi military-technical college, it proved easier to bury the robust structure than to blow it up. For a time the hill served as a ski hill before it was re-purposed as a “listening station.” Believed to be part of ECHELON, a global network of listening stations, this station was erected on the hill and run by the U.S. National Security Agency to eavesdrop on communist East Berlin. To their surprise, they found that the local Ferris wheel, erected each year for the German-American Festival, helped relay signals and improve their listening efforts, and the US radio spooks asked if the wheel could be left up for a longer period. The station was abandoned after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and though there were plans to resurrect it for commercial purposes, today it is a vandalized and abandoned shell. The station’s elevated platforms offer incredible views of Berlin’s skyline, as well as the nearby 1934 Olympic Stadium and Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation. Some say that the NSA built tunnels down through the mountain into the Nazi military-technical college, to serve as either an emergency bunker or escape route, however, no evidence of this exists. Wild boars roam the grounds around Teufelsberg, and visitors are advised to stay on the paths. Access to the station is now officially permitted from 11 am to sunset. There is a fee, and paid parking is also available however, do note that they only take cash. Some visitors have found an opening in the chain link perimeter fence and used the exterior stairwell to gain entrance to the elevated platforms and radomes. Any visit to Teufelsberg should be taken with great caution – there are potentially dangerous openings, no guardrails, and an open elevator shaft (approx. 10 stories) not to mention it is illegal.  Take the S-Bahn to Grunewald. Walk or ride a bike NW via Dauerwaldweg and Harbigstrasse. Turn right into a parking lot and take the main paved path past the kite flying hill. Walk through the forest (watch for wild boars) and turn left at the T. Take a sharp right into the fenced area. There is an entrance fee and the place is open from 11 to sunset every day. And if you happen to be there on a hot summer day: Just keep on walking down the street from the S-Bahn station for another five minutes, and you'll end up at a lovely little lake with a sandy beach that is perfect for swimming (in the nude if you wish, as the locals do). Swimming clothes optional, no entrance fee. Right next to it is a little brick building with a chimney, that used to be a power plant, now it serves as an ecological education center, but also sells cakes and sausages, coffee and ice cream.",spheres spies nazis abandoned ruins
23,The DDR Museum,"Berlin, Germany",A fascinating insight into daily life in the Eastern Bloc.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ddr-museum-berlin-berlin-germany,"p class=”p1”>A popular joke in East Germany involved Erich Honecker, leader of the German Democratic Republic, discussing hobbies with the head of the feared Stasi secret police, Erich Mielke. Honecker says “I collect all the jokes about me”, to which Miekle replied, “Well, we have almost the same hobby. I collect all the people who tell jokes about you.” The Deutsche Demokratische Republik, which existed between 1949 to 1990 was one of the most peculiar and sinister countries behind the Iron Curtain. The most feared police state in recent history, it was the embodiment of George Orwell’s dystopian 1984. The DDR museum, situated on the banks of the River Spree, where the Unter den Linden turns into Karl-Liebknecht strasse, is a fascinating insight into daily life in East Germany, where it’s estimated one in ten people worked as an informant for the Stasi. What’s most remarkable about the DDR museum, is its interactivity. With over 200,000 artifacts to draw upon, visitors are fully immersed in the secret world behind the Berlin Wall. The television in the model living room from an average East German apartment plays shows created by the state-run Deutscher Fernsehfunk. Pick up the telephone and you can hear the slight click on the line indicating the bugging recording of your conversation. In the DDR every facet of life was state controlled. You can listen to bands such as Karat and Puhdys recorded on the state-owned Amiga label, which took the place of banned Western music. Polyester clothes were bought from the Dederon fashion catalog, which featured the latest in uniforms for the Free German Youth organizations alongside the state-designed equivalent of 1970s fashions. The official hatred of anything Western meant that words such as ‘hotdog’ were banned by the state. The DDR equivalent was a hybrid of ketchup and sausage, called the Ketwurst, developed by the Gastronomic Rationalization and Research Centre in 1978. With US soft drinks similarly black-marketed, the Miltitz Chemical Works created their own unique lemon-flavored Vita-Cola. One of the most ubiquitous symbols of East Germany was the Trabant car. Mass produced, another popular joke went that the best feature of a Trabant was a heater at the back to keep your hands warm whilst you pushed it. In the museum you can drive a period Trabant through a virtual simulated housing estate in East Berlin. Renovated in 2016, the museum now includes a full-scale replica of an East German apartment - complete with bedrooms, kitchen, a functioning television and an elevator ride. As western products began to replace their own in the 1990s, many East German’s wistfully looked back to the days when their country had zero unemployment and virtually no poverty, and state-sponsored nudist beach holidays. Such is the nostalgia for the now defunct society, it has its own term : Ostalgie, derived from the German for east and nostalgia. Hindsight now shows how extensive the Stasi eavesdropping was, how the secret police prisons operated, and how prevalent state sanctioned anabolic steroid use was in their athletic programs. The DDR museum provides an excellent immersive look into daily life into a Soviet satellite state, long since gone, which was cut off from the outside world for over fifty years. Update as of January 2023:  The museum is closed until March 21, 2023.  Closed till Feb 2023 due to aquarium bursting",museums
24,Vestiges of the Berlin Wall,"Berlin, Germany","On the Spree bank, discover one of the last reminders of a symbolic wall that divided, and was torn down by the people.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vestiges-berlin-wall,"When the wall separating East and West Berlin fell in 1989, artists sought to reclaim something which had been untouchable for so long, and transform it from a symbol of oppression into an expression of freedom. What resulted can still be seen today, stretching along the former borderline that ended at the Spree and Mühlenstrasse. Popularly known as the East Side Gallery, this series of 105 permanent murals forms an open air art space that runs for more than a kilometer down the Wall’s eastern face. The works were painted by street artists from all over the world following a merger of Germany’s two large art collectives, VBK and BBK. Though ranging in stylistic form and content, the themes expressed across their faces are united in an almost euphoric feeling, expressing a belief in a brighter, better future the artists believed lay just around the corner. Though the place never wavered in its status as a destination for visitors from the outside, and Berliners generally thought favorably of the installation’s presence in their city, once reunification had become the city’s “new normal,” a lack of care had begun to take its toll on the East Side Gallery. By the turn of the new millennia, the East Side Gallery had incurred a significant amount of damage; an estimated two-thirds of the murals had either been vandalized or were noticeably decaying due to negligence. A period of restoration took place in 2009 to help, executed by friends of the gallery. Despite this, in 2013, a property development company even went so far as to slate a portion of the wall for demolition without notifying the muralists whose work would be affected, as this bit of history stood in the way of modern progress. The East Side Gallery remains in danger of falling victim to this “home-blindness” today. And, much like inconvenient history itself, “if you don’t see it, you don’t think of it,” which makes sparing some time to commune with the increasingly invisible-in-plain-sight gallery along the wall even more imperative.",relics and reliquaries disaster areas outsider architecture ruins

Founded in 1810, the Museum für Naturkunde is Germany’s biggest natural history museum, with impressive collections in minerals, zoology, and paleontology. Highlights of its illustrious collections (some of which go back to Prussia) include an example of an Archaeopteryx (the oldest bird known to have existed), the world’s largest chunk of amber, Tristan, Europe’s first authentic T. rex skeleton, extinct animals like the quagga and Tasmanian tiger, and deceased local animal celebrities, including Bobby the gorilla and Knut the polar bear. The tallest towering mounted dinosaur is a Giraffatitan brancai (although it had a few different dinosaur species mixed in its construction). An absolute gem of this collection is the so-called “wet collection,” hundreds of thousands of fish and sea creatures preserved in glass jars. Some are over 100 years old. They have so many, it fills a whole specially designed room of the museum, with shelves that reach upwards and only stop just under the roof. And the room is illuminated in a certain way so that the whole place shines like amber. Though it is somewhat hidden in the back of the museum, it’s a must-see.

27,Lichtenstein Castle,"Lichtenstein, Germany",A striking 12th-century-style castle built on the edge of a cliff.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lichtenstein-castle,"Not to be confused with the tiny European nation of Liechtenstein, Lichtenstein Castle is located in the southwest state of Baden Wurttemberg, in Germany, overlooking the village of Honau. The “castle” is actually a hunting lodge, built on the ruins of a former castle, and the current structure was completed in 1842. It was built in a pseudo-medieval style, which was very en vogue in the 19th century. In the novel Lichtenstein, author Wilhelm Hauff had described medieval life in the original castle so vividly that local ruler Wilhelm Graf von Württemberg felt inspired to have the fictional castle built in reality. Ruins of the original castle, built in the 1100s, can be found just outside the walls of the existing castle. The most striking feature of the castle is that the outer wall is built on the edge of a cliff, which can be very intimidating for anyone with a fear of heights! During World War II, an American tank passing through the valley below fired a shell, which directly hit the main tower. Fortunately, the shell failed to explode, saving the impressive building from destruction. However, a hole in the plaster where the shell struck remains to this day. Fans of Super Street Fighter II may also recognize the castle, which provided inspiration for Cammy’s stage.  The castle is open to the public for tours daily from April to October, and on weekends only in February, March, and November.

Many of the spare furnishings also remain giving visitors a sense of what bunker life might have been like. The second floor begins to get more gruesome with a multi-room exhibition on medicine and torture throughout the ages including displays regarding amputation, cannibalism, and animal-to-human blood transfusions.

29,Führerbunker Parking Lot,"Berlin, Germany",The bunker where Hitler took his own life is hidden under this deliberately ordinary parking lot.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fuhrerbunker-parking-lot,"On January 16th, 1945 Adolf Hitler went underground. Until his eventual death about five months later, he would live in a bunker below the garden of the Reich Chancellery, a site that is now a (purposefully) unremarkable parking lot. Originally intended as an air-raid shelter, the Führerbunker underground complex was expanded to provide permanent protection for Hitler and other members of the Nazi leadership (Joseph Goebbels and his family would move into the bunker in April of 1945). The finalized Führerbunker was a multistory structure nearly 30 feet below ground and protected by 13 feet of concrete. Things were already looking dire for the Germans at the beginning of 1945, and the situation rapidly deteriorated, as opposition forces pressed in from all sides towards Berlin. Hitler’s last living moment above ground came on his 56th birthday, April 20th, 1945, when he awarded the Iron Cross to members of the Hitler Youth during a ceremony in the Chancellery garden. That very evening, the Red Army began shelling Berlin’s city center. It was soon clear that all was lost. On May 1st, 1945 Grand-Admiral Karl Donitz, who served as Commander-in-Chief for northern Germany would make an announcement on Hamburg radio that Hitler had died that afternoon, fighting “at the head of his troops.” This statement, although believed by the international press at the time, was false. Hitler had married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony inside the Führerbunker in the early morning hours of April 29th, right before dictating his last will and testament. Marital life would be short-lived for the couple, who committed suicide at about 3:30PM on April 30th—he by bullet to the head and cyanide, she by cyanide. In accordance with the will, their remains were burned and buried in the garden. Later, Soviet intelligence operatives who discovered the complex would find more than a dozen bodies, including those of Goebbel’s six children, who had also ingested cyanide. The Soviets razed the Chancellery buildings and also attempted to destroy the bunker, without much luck. The site would sit unused and neglected until after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when development of the area prompted the discovery of several underground sections. These were promptly destroyed, although there is rumor that some rooms (sealed to the public) remain. Not wanting the space to become a Neo-Nazi shrine, the German government kept the location of the bunker undisclosed for many years. Nondescript apartment and office buildings, as well as the parking lot, were erected on the site and the bunker went unmentioned. The space was not officially recognized as the place of Hitler’s death until June of 2006, when a plaque including historical background and a schematic diagram of the bunker was quietly placed at the intersection of In den Ministergärten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Straße. The bunker location and associated information plaque can be found at the corner of In den Ministergärten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Straße",suicide bunkers nazis world war ii military

These are the sobering words that grace the bronze plaque you will find at your feet in the center of Bebelplatz Square. Nearby, a pane of thick glass replacing the pavement acts as a window into a subterranean room. In this room is bookshelf after bookshelf—enough shelf space to store 20,000 tomes, every single one hauntingly empty. Israeli artist Micha Ullman created the installation, and called it “Library.” Much of Europe still bears the scars of the Nazi regime, and the Bebelplatz (formerly known as Opernplatz) is no different. Many of the buildings (now restored) that bordered the square were destroyed during the Battle of Berlin in WWII, but the shadow that hangs over Bebelplatz originated with an event that happened earlier, when many in Berlin was still enamored with the Nazi Party, and the idea of a “pure” culture. On May 15th, 1933, a call to students to take nationwide action against “The Un-German Spirit” and purge the universities of “Jewish intellectualism” rang out from the Main Office for Press and Propaganda of the German Student Union. Students in several university towns answered the call, and in an act of solidarity that would foreshadow the very dark days ahead, close to 25,000 books were destroyed. Opernplatz was now to be known as the location of one of the most famous book burnings in history. A crowd of over 40,000, including Joseph Goebbels himself, chanted, gave speeches, and sang as thousands of books written by Germans and non-Germans alike went up in flames. Jack London, Karl Marx, Hemingway, and countless others turned to ashes as Goebbels bellowed on and on about purity in German culture. Some of the persecuted authors were actually present to witness the destruction of their work, including author Erich Kästner—who despite the trauma of witnessing this assault on free-thinking, was lucky…he left the country in self-exile before he suffered the fate of many of his contemporaries—death camps and execution. Today the square reflects the new world of Berlin—the buildings have been restored, and the square is once again filled with happy people, music, and laughter. It was even given a new name, Bebelplatz, to help with the fresh start. But there is no erasing the night of censorship that took place here, and there are reminders all around. Along with the Library installation, the square has mounted several plaques as well as a giant monument shaped like a stack of books—impenetrable to fire, and larger than life.  The large sculpture shaped like a stack of books was only a temporary exhibit, displayed as part of the sculpture boulevard ""Walk of Ideas"" during the football world cup from May to September 2006. It is no longer at this location. Confusingly, the squares on both sides of the state Opera House are signposted ""Bebelplatz.""

35,David Hasselhoff Museum,"Berlin, Germany","What started as a tongue-in-cheek shrine is now a full-blown museum celebrating ""The Hoff"" and his longtime love affair with Berlin.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/david-hasselhoff-museum,"[As of October 2021, the Circus Hostel, where the David Hasselhoff Museum is located, is still closed due to the pandemic. A note on the door, however, says that they “will return”.] In the bowels of the Circus Hostel in Berlin Mitte, Hoff-fanatics can pay homage to their idol at the world’s only David Hasselhoff museum. What started as a perhaps tongue-in-cheek shrine to the former Baywatch and Nightrider star has evolved into a full-blown one man museum celebrating the legend, his music and acting career, and of course his longstanding love affair with the once-divided city. Some credit David Hasselhof with contributing to Germany’s reunification after performing his unifying West German No. 1 hit, “Looking for Freedom” to jubilant crowds at the Berlin Wall at the iconic New Year’s Eve Celebration held in 1989, weeks after the wall had started to be taken down. The museum includes a mural of “The Hoff” himself, various photos of the actor, Baywatch and Nightrider paraphernalia, and a replica of the famous piano key scarf Hasselhof wore during his 1989 performance at the Berlin Wall. Whether a cheeky commendation or sincere glorification remains under debate, but one thing is for certain: David Hasselhoff, for good or bad, is synonymous with Berlin’s history, and the museum pays credit where credit is due. The Hostel management have even gone as far as to campaign to Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel to request the name of the street change to David-Hasselhoff-Strasse. It’s quite simply an unmissable stop for any Hoff fan or Berlin visitor looking for a uniquely Berlin story to take home. Update as of October 2021: The museum is currently closed indefinitely. Update as of October 2022: Hostel and museum are open.  The Circus Hostel is on the corner of Torstrasse and Weinbergsweg (opposite the Circus Hotel).

36,Schwebebahn Wuppertal,"Wuppertal, Germany","This ""floating railway"" is one of the world's oldest monorail systems.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/schwebebahn-wuppertal,"The Schwebebahn Wuppertal, literally translated as the “Floating Railway of Wuppertal,” has a storied past. First, it is the world’s oldest monorail, and, as a “suspended” monorail, it runs by hanging onto a single rail above it. Second, while it is one of the world’s safest transport systems—with an astonishing safety run of ninety six years without a serious accident—it recently had its first fatal crash. And of course, there was that incident with the elephant… The Schwebebahn Wuppertal (pronounced “Woopertall”) is the most important public transport system in Wuppertal. Mounted on a 13.3-kilometer long, 7- to 13-meter tall iron bridge, the monorail provides a nice view to all who ride on it. Despite looking like something out of the future, the suspended monorail is quite old. Originally proposed in 1824, the cars were to be pulled by horse teams on the ground. While a prototype was built, the full system was never constructed for political reasons. But in 1898 the idea of a suspended monorail was dusted off, this time to be powered by electricity. Building started in 1901, and by 1903, at a cost of 16 million Goldmark, the monorail was open. Emperor Wilhelm II took the inaugural ride. The Emperor had nothing to worry about: The Schwebebahn Wuppertal was, and is, remarkably safe. The cars tilt gently with the curves, and the monorail has almost no chance of falling off the track — it happened just once, in 1917, resulting in minor injuries. After, a system was installed to make it nearly impossible for it to happen again. Also, unlike the subway, there’s no chance the monorail will hit people who have fallen or jumped onto the tracks. From its opening in 1903, the Schwebebahn Wuppertal ran with a nearly perfect safety record — a truck crashed into the rail, collapsing it, in 1968, but there were no trains around — until 1999, when workers failed to remove a metal claw from the track. A train hit the claw at 50 kmph and derailed into the Wupper River below, killing 5 and injuring 49 others. This was the worst and only fatal accident in the monorail’s history. Recently, in 2008, there was a minor crash when a crane truck moved into the way of the oncoming train and tore a 10-meter rip in the train floor. But, apart from the driver of the truck who broke his leg, the injuries were all minor. Perhaps the most bizarre accident to occur on the Schwebebahn Wuppertal was that involving a three-year-old circus elephant named Tuffi. On July 21, 1950, in an attempt to promote its upcoming show, Althoff Circus loaded Tuffi, a young, multi-ton elephant, onto the monorail. This was a mistake. During the ride, Tuffi panicked and burst through the side of the train, falling some 9 meters. Lucky for her, the train was above the Wupper River at the time, and she went splashing into the water. The elephant (along with two journalists and one passenger who were hit by Tuffi on the way out) received only minor injuries. And Tuffi went on to live another 39 years. The spot where Tuffi fell is now marked by a painting of an elephant on a nearby building, and there’s an illustrated children’s book about the incident, Tuffi und die Schwebebahn, as well as a local milk brand which still uses the name “Tuffi.”",retro-tech inventions

The sculpture, which is made of steel and is over 30 feet tall, is a staircase in the shape of a double helix. The bottom of the steps has a small opening, so you can actually climb the stairs yourself. “Umschreibung” is a German word which means “euphemism,” or “circumlocution” and the Umschreibung web site states that the title translates to “‘circumscription’ or ‘periphrasis’ –  a movement without destination, a space defined by motion rather than walls.” It’s not easy to know exactly what Danish artist Olafur Eliasson had in mind when he created his towering sculpture in 2004. The sculpture is located in the middle of the courtyard of the KPMG building; in the midst of all that high-powered ambition and drive, perhaps it stands as a reminder that no matter how hard we work, we might all be going nowhere. Or perhaps the idea is more charitable than that. Life isn’t a destination but rather a continuous movement.   Inside the KPMG building courtyard.

Virchow filled the museum with over 23,000 specimens before his death in 1902. The museum was closed to the public shortly after his passing but continued to be used as a teaching resource. During this time the collection continued to grow, but heavy damages sustained from WWII left only 1,800 specimens intact. The museum was reopened in 1998 in the same location but with a broader focus than the original and was renamed The Berlin Museum of Medical History. Today, the museum covers 300 years of medical history and contains 10,000 specimens, some of which are from the original Virchow collection. Specimens on display come in varying levels of disturbing - from the mild arthritic knee to the truly grotesque fetal specimens which include rare congenital deformities such as sirenomelia and cyclopia. In addition to the pathological specimens, the museum also features an anatomical theatre and a historical ward, complete with iron lung and a 19th-century birthing chair.

41,Church of St. Ursula,"Cologne, Germany",A church filled with the bones of hundreds of virgins martyrs—or so they say.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-st-ursula,"The short version of the story goes a little something like this: Saint Ursula was a Roman-British Princess who, in the 300s, decided she would go on a pan-European pilgrimage. She packed a boat with her 11,000 virginal best friends—which immediately calls to question what kind of boat in the 300s could have fit 11,000 people on it—and the giggling virgins set out for Rome. In a miraculous turn of events, a freak storm blew the boat to Rome in a single day, and Ursula convinced the Pope and a few other religious figures to join them on their pilgrimage. Everything was going great until the ladies stopped in Cologne, where they were captured by the Huns—a sort of collective boogeyman plaguing Europe at the time. All 11,000 virgins were promptly beheaded and Ursula was shot dead. In 1155 a mass grave was found in Cologne—they had already found some remains claimed to be the virgins, but this was the jackpot - and it was assumed by the Church that this must be the gravesite of Ursula and the 11,000 virgins. The church, which was already dedicated to St. Ursula, was expanded to make room for the incredible amount of martyred virginal bones that it now needed to house. Known as the Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber) it is still there today, a massive reliquary filled with dozens of head-busts containing skulls, arm reliquaries, and walls covered in bone. The chamber has been described as a “veritable tsunami of ribs, shoulder blades, and femurs… arranged in zigzags and swirls and even in the shapes of Latin words.” The church is overflowing with virginal bones, or with some type of bones anyway. Most historians, as well as the Catholic Church, agree that the story of Ursula is probably exaggerated—if not entirely fictional—particularly the number 11,000. Among the explanations is that there was indeed an Ursula who was traveling with 11 virgins, who were indeed martyred. This incident was then abbreviated as E.M.V., then misread by an overeager monk as 11,000. Another explanation is that Ursula was traveling with just one virgin who happened to be named Undecimilla, which read as 11,000. It is also possible that this was a story that had been kicking around in pre-Christian form for some time, and Ursula’s was just the latest incarnation. There is another argument to be made—that the Cologne church came up with the number 11,000 because it meant, for one, that the church would become an even hotter pilgrimage spot than it already was. What’s more, along with the church’s old Roman cemetery, the number 11,000 provided church officials with a nearly endless supply of saints and saintly reliquaries that they could sell for a tidy profit. The entire thing is a sort of early Christian tourist trap, complete with holy tchotchkes. Of course, if this is the case and there were no 11,000 virgins, whose bones are in the church? The answer seems to be everyone and anyone—women, children, men, and even dogs. A Cologne surgeon got in hot water with the church for pointing out that a couple of the head reliquaries contained the skulls, not of virgins, but of large mastiffs. Regardless of whether the bones are those of martyred virgins or regular Romans who happened to get dug up by eager relic-makers, nothing lessens the amazing look of the church or its fantastic reliquary, where skulls are adorned with garlands and coronets (some even retaining tufts of hair). The walls are covered in golden and silver reliquaries, gilded relics abound, and one wall is covered entirely in bone, spelling out the phrase “Holy Ursula, Pray For Us.” It is a truly amazing sight to behold. Ursula left her mark in other ways as well. Besides the Order of Ursulines founded in 1535 to teach young girls, the Virgin Islands were named after her and her band of 11,000 martyred virgins.",ossuaries relics relics and reliquaries saints catacombs and crypts sacred spaces

It tells the story of the people who were forced to flee Germany, were exiled by the Nazis, or were killed. More than 150 biographies of Jewish people and many firsthand accounts are displayed in a reading room in the Rathaus (City Hall) in Schöneberg. For each person or family there is an album containing their personal story and photos—memories that were not always easy to find. The organizers tracked down the surviving family members to get their stories. Many people were deported and died in Nazi concentration camps, but there are also albums of the people who survived, fled, or hid. This very personal memorial is unique and impressive. The reader can get to know each person or family, is able to connect with them, and gets a better understanding of their fears and feelings of hopelessness. There are some very courageous and astonishing stories. The exhibition includes the stories of some of the more famous citizens of Schöneberg and Tempelhof, such as Albert Einstein, the Comedian Harmonists, Kurt Tucholsky, Billy Wilder, Alice Salomon, Nelly Sachs, and others.

43,The Eagle's Nest,"Berchtesgaden, Germany","Soaring over 6,000 feet in the Bavarian Alps, this beer garden was once Hitler's 50th birthday present.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-eagles-nest-berchtesgaden-germany,"As the Allies rushed through Western Europe following the German defeat on D-Day, one of the grand prizes to be taken was the infamous Eagle’s Nest. This estate, which sat 6,000 feet high in the Alps, had actually been given to Hitler as a birthday present. The name “Eagle’s Nest” was adopted by the Allies, but it was known throughout Germany as the “Kehlsteinhaus.” It was situated atop the Obersalzberg mountains in one of the most beautiful parts of Bavaria, overlooking the small town of Berchtesgaden. The Eagle’s Nest was designed as a 50th birthday present for Adolf Hitler. Commissioned and overseen by Martin Bormann, the home remains an impressive feat of engineering even today. It was reached by what is still today Germany’s steepest road. Bormann recruited Italian engineers and road makers, experts in carving thoroughfares through the Alps. The steep mountain road ended in a tunnel that was dug into the mountainside, at the end of which was, as there still is today, a gleaming brass elevator. With reserve power still supplied by a U-Boat engine, the elevator would carry guests and its infamous owner to the final summit. The house itself was fairly modest, but luxuriously decorated (the red marble fireplace was a gift from Mussolini), and the views over Germany and Austria were spectacular. In reality however, Hitler rarely set foot in his extravagant present. Rumored to suffer from not only chronic claustrophobia, but also vertigo, Hitler preferred to spend his time in his opulent mansion further down the mountain, the infamous Berghof. The famous photographs of Hitler relaxing in the summer with Eva Braun, his dog, surrounded by children, were all taken down the mountain. Much of the inner circle of the Nazi party also built homes here, as Hitler spent roughly a third of his time in power here. A village for around 2,000 members of the party was constructed, with kilometers of still hidden bunkers and tunnels burrowed into the mountainside beneath them. But the Eagle’s Nest retained such symbolic power that various divisions of the Allied Forces raced each other to be first to Berchtesgaden, then to the mountain top home. Several claim the honor of being first to the Eagle’s Nest, including the French 2nd Armored Division, and more famously, as commemorated in the HBO drama, Band of Brothers, the U.S. 101st Airborne’s Easy Company. In 1960, control of the Eagle’s Nest was handed back to the German government, along with the problem of what to do with it. As with many ex-Nazi sites, there was a worry about preserving a monument for neo-Nazis to visit. And so, the spectacular Eagle’s Nest, Hitler’s 50th birthday gift, was turned into what it is today: a beer garden and restaurant, with little mention of its former notorious owner. The guided tours available however make compulsory stops at a “Documentation Center” at Obersalzberg, a museum that tells the full story of the horrors of the Nazi party era in Germany. At night, in the peaceful, beautiful Alpine town of Berchtesgaden, it is still possible to look up to the mountains soaring high above, and on one of the highest, see a distant twinkling light coming from the Eagle’s Nest. Update as of September 2020: The Eagle’s Nest is closed and will reopen in 2021.",nazis eccentric homes world war ii homes military
44,Spandauer Zitadelle (Spandau Citadel),"Berlin, Germany",A 12th-century fortress containing some of Berlin's oldest buildings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spandauer-zitadelle,"Built on a strategic island at the confluence of the Havel and Spree rivers, various fortifications have protected the town of Spandau (now a borough of Berlin) since at least 1197. The citadel’s current form, however, dates mostly from the mid-to-late-16th century, though it contains older segments such as the 13th century Juliusturm (Julius Tower), Berlin’s oldest building. The fortress was designed and built primarily by Count Rochus zu Lynar, and was completed in the year 1594, though it would go on to serve a military role for the next 360-odd years. During the Thirty Years War, it served as a base of operations for Swedish forces during King Gustav II Adolf’s intervention. The citadel would first fall to enemy troops in 1806 when it was taken over by Napoleon’s armies. During the French siege, much of the citadel was destroyed, but was rebuilt, and served as a prison for Prussian dissidents, as well as a treasury, most notably being used to store war reparations after the Franco-Prussian war. The end of its military career came in 1945 when it was stationed by Nazi soldiers during the Battle of Berlin. When it had become clear that they had lost, the Germans surrendered the citadel to Soviet soldiers, who were the last military personnel to occupy it. With the division of Berlin into four occupation zones, Spandau was handed over to the British, and the citadel handed over to civilian use. Beginning in 1950, the Spandau Citadel was the site of a building school, but in 1986, became a tourist attraction and cultural site. Now, the only cannons that one would hear from the citadel would be during a performance of The 1812 Overture during one of the many concerts that take place there. However, it may be possible to see old cannons along with other archeological finds, historical pieces, and works of art in the various museums and exhibitions that are located in the citadel. Finally, the vaulted roofs of the various fortress buildings make a perfect winter roost for the 10,000 bats what visit the citadel every year.  From the nearest U-Bahn station, U Zitadelle on the U7 Line, it is a five to ten minute walk to the citadel.",fortresses ancient architecture

It is unclear when the carving first appeared, but the tree became a popular tourist attraction following King’s death in 2015.

46,Karl Junker House,"Lemgo, Germany",An intricate and amazing house built by architect Karl Junker.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karl-junker-house,"Karl Junker had both an advantage and disadvantage when it came to building his great vision. While he was a trained architect, by his thirties, he was also deeply schizophrenic. Never hospitalized, he created his life’s work—the architecture, furniture, design, and murals for his house—from a palette of the world inside his head. Living on the large sum of money left to him by his grandfather, Junker spent his life elaborating again and again on his singular masterpiece. Human faces peer out from the intricate ceiling murals, and the curved staircase is encased in a wooden structure like a cage. The house, which had no visitors or occupants except for Junker, was clearly designed by Junker for a family and guests. There is a nursery, a guest room, a salon, and a dining room, all formally decorated with hand-carved and gilded furniture. Everything points to a life that Junker yearned for, but knew he would never have. Despite the overall style of the house being unique to Junker’s mind, it does show some aspects of popular styles contemporary of the time, including Arts and Crafts, Neo-Gothic, Tudor Revival, Expressionism, Tramp Art, as well as older German vernacular. Near the end of his life, visitors began to arrive at the strange house, asking for tours.

47,Schwerbelastungskörper,"Berlin, Germany",Super-heavy Nazi architectural experiment.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/schwerbelastungskorper,"In the 1930s Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler was at the height of his power. Hitler envisioned Berlin as the capital of a new global empire, and - together with his favorite architect, Alber Speer - he embarked on a massive urban redesign project. The centerpiece of this project was to be the massive Volkshalle, a dome so immense it could have comfortably housed St. Peter’s Basilica inside it. Construction of such a gigantic structure presented numerous problems, the biggest one being that Berlin was founded on a swamp. In order to estimate the ability of its soft underlying soil to sustain the weight of their planned dome, the Nazis decided to conduct an experiment. In 1941, they built a huge concrete cylinder, 18 meters high and weighing about 12,650 metric tons. If this “Schwerbelastungskörper” (German for “heavy loading body”) sunk less then 6 centimeters, the soil would be deemed solid enough to sustain the dome. In fact, the cylinder sank over 18 centimeters in three years. Never one to let empirical evidence stand in his way, Hitler decided to disregard the results and build the enormous Volkshalle anyway. But weight wouldn’t have been the only problem with the dome. It is believed that the hall’s acoustics would have made communication within it almost impossible, and that the building would have had its own “weather,” including indoor rain. In the end, Hitler’s defeat prevented this doomed project from even being started. The enormous cylinder stood too close to several blocks of apartments to safely demolish after the war. So the Schwerbelastungskörper stood where it was. Since 1995, it has been protected as a historic monument. From the center of the city take U6 metro line to Platz der Luftbrücke.

The top part of the clock recounts the story of the fantastically expensive and sumptuous marriage of Bavarian Duke Wilhelm V in 1568, with mechanical jousters representing Bavaria in blue triumph over knights of Lothingren in red. The original party lasted two weeks, and was attended by thousands of revelers, the highlight being the royal joust, which took place in the Marienplatz where the clock is now located. A couple of blocks away is the Hofbraeuhaus founded by Wilhelm V to meet his needs for brown ale, the first brewery in the city. Lavish wedding as beer aside, Duke Wilhelm V was also known as a militant Catholic leader who took increasingly drastic measures both of personal piety and of public anti-Protestant policy. Under his leadership Bavaria became known as the center of early counter-reformation actions, including the final expulsion of Catholics from Bavaria and numerous witch hunts - a legacy which continued after his death by his son Maximillian I. On the lower portion of the glockenspiel, coopers (barrel makers) twirl through their famous Schäfflerstanz. According to tradition, the Schäfflerstanz, or Cooper’s Dance is tied to the end of a 1517 plague when the local coopers lured the frightened residents back out into the streets with some foot slapping dancing. The details may be apocryphal, but Munich did indeed suffer a terrible plague in 1635 which wiped out about a third of the population. Considered one of the last original guild dances in Germany, the Schäfflerstanz is traditionally reenacted by live dancers every seven years during the festival of Fasching, coming up next in 2012. At the end of the show, a small golden bird chirps from the top of the glockenspiel. The whole show lasts about 15 minutes. A relatively recent addition to the ancient town square, the glockenspiel was built in 1908 as part of the second half of building on the gingerbread Gothic-revival New Town Hall. Amazingly, the building escaped major damage during the heavy bombardment during WWII which left other buildings nearby roofless. A 2007 renovation apparently left the carillon out of tune, but it has since been remedied. The show starts daily at 11am, with additional shows at noon and 5pm in the summertime, lasting 12-15 minutes long.

Making a smaller nighttime appearance, at 9pm two figures - an angel on one side, and a night watchman on the other - emerge below the clock face.",automata astounding timepieces clocks music
49,Hohenzollern Crypt in the Berlin Cathedral,"Berlin, Germany",Beneath the impressive baroque cathedral that rises from the center of Berlin lies the largest collection of Prussian royals in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hohenzollern-crypt-in-the-berlin-cathedral,"The Hohenzollern crypt beneath the Berlin Cathedral is the most important dynastic crypt in Germany, and one of a handful of major dynastic crypts in Europe. Ninety-four sarcophagi and burial monuments range from the end of the 16th century to the beginning of the 20th, spanning four centuries of Brandenburg-Prussian burial culture. The Hohenzollern dynasty has its roots in the Holy Roman Empire; the house ruled the Duchy of Prussia as well as served as the Electors of Brandenburg. They parlayed this power into creating the Kingdom of Prussia and, subsequently, the German Empire. They ruled the Empire as Kaisers, benefiting from the realpolitik genius of Otto von Bismarck before destroying themselves in the bloody nightmare that was World War I. The current Berlin Cathedral was built in 1905, partly destroyed during World War II, and basically left in ruin till 1975, when it was finally decided to restore it. The Berlin Cathedral was rededicated in 1993. However, the small but significant funerary complex it sits on top of dates back to the late 16th century, and its restoration is still ongoing. The historic crypt includes a wide variety of artistic styles. From simple to very ornate, some of these final resting places are in better shape than others. Among the most notable sarcophagi are those of Frederick I and Sophie Charlotte, the first King and Queen of Prussia and the grandparents of Frederick the Great. The cathedral’s dome was bombed during World War II, and the resulting collapse and fire damaged and destroyed some of the crypt.

50,Hatch Sticker Museum,"Berlin, Germany",This little museum is making sure that the art and history of the graffiti sticker is not scraped from history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hatch-sticker-museum,"Opened in 2008 as an offshoot of globally-known sticker company hatch, the tiny Sticker Museum in Berlin is a based around one collectors personal assemblage of rare and unique street art stickers from around the world. While the museum is affiliated with hatch, the bulk of the adhesive art works on display are taken from the personal collection of Oliver Baudach, who began preserving the stickers he came across in 1983. The museum displays around 6,000 pieces from his some 20,000. Displayed in cacophonous frames the stickers are the type one might see on a street lamp, skate deck, or mailbox in any big city. Staying away from children’s stickers entirely, most of the pieces are designed in the much talked about pop art style that many street artists traffic in currently. Skateboard logos and band designs jockey for space next to hand illustrated name tags and postal labels. All types of stickers are welcome and donations are encouraged. In addition to Baudach’s permanent collection, an adjoining space also features a rotating roster of exhibition shows focusing on a single artist or style. While the space is a little hard to find, it would simply seem to be reflective of the very pieces of art it exhibits which are often hidden off the beaten path, although now they have less chance of being forgotten.

51,Treetop Tower of Rügen,"Binz, Germany","A long spiraling walkway winds through the woods, and around a copper beech tree at the center.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/treetop-tower-of-rugen,"Located within the Rügen Natural Heritage Center, this treetop view tower, nicknamed the “Eagle’s Nest,” is a stunning structure. A spiraling walkway, surrounded by greenery, slowly winds its way up and around a 100-foot-tall copper beech tree. The only thing more impressive are the incredible views from the top. The Rügen Natural Heritage Center (Naturerbe Zentrum Rügen) is located on the eastern side of the island of Rügen, Germany’s largest island by area. Famous for its national parks, beech tree forests, and chalk cliffs, it’s a prime destination for nature lovers, trekkers, and people looking to relax at the island’s seaside resorts. One of the most popular attractions is the spiraling treetop tower. The summit of the 131-foot-tall nest rises up above the surrounding woodlands to a total height of 270 feet above sea level. From the top of the wood and steel structure, visitors have a stunning view of the landscape. On a clear day, you can see all the way to the church steeples of Stralsund on the mainland, and the pylons of Rügen Bridge. Access to the tower is via a 1,367-yard-long treetop walkway (Baumwipfelpfad), which threads through the beeches until it reaches the tower. From here, visitors begin the slowly spiraling ascent around the central beech tree, which is more than 70 years old. Along the way, you can see the many insects, small animals and birds that live in this treetop environment. If you’re lucky, you might even see an eagle as it searches for prey in the forest.  The treetop walk is open year-round unless extreme lightning or hail makes it too dangerous for visitors. You can explore the Eagle’s Nest on your own or join a 1.5-hour guided tour, with departures at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. as well as 4.30 p.m. in the summer. The ascent requires a step-free walk of 656 yards along the gently rising walkway. The incline is never more than 6 percent, making it wheelchair- and pram-friendly.",panoramas forests trails trees ecosystems plants nature architectural oddities architecture
52,Krämerbrücke,"Erfurt, Germany",This historic stone bridge has an entire neighborhood clinging to its sides.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kramerbrucke,"Originally constructed as early as the 12th century, the German Krämerbrücke (Merchant’s Bridge)  is flanked on either side by tall buildings that are still inhabited today making it the longest inhabited bridge in the world. When the bridge crossing the Breitstrom, a portion of the Gera River, was first built it was a wooden construction that was prone to catching fire and burning down. However by late in the 13th century, the repeated fires had sent a message to the local builders and it was replaced with a stone bridge ended by large stone churches at either terminus of the span. By the 15th century the vaulted bridge was one of the only constructions to survive another fire, this time one that destroyed much of the surrounding city of Erfurt. After this, the current buildings were built atop either side of the narrow bridge. All told, 62 narrow houses were built atop the bridge, each carrying about three storeys. The constructions have survived to the present day, although the houses have been converted to around 32 living and commercial spaces. The ground level storefronts are mainly antique and artisan shops while the upper levels of the building are still private residences. The bridge homes are the jewel of the city which celebrates their claim to fame each year with a festival centered on the little community called Krämerbrückenfest.",world's longest eccentric homes bridges shops homes architectural oddities architecture

Unfortunately for him, it was also the smallest. Prior to the Linderhof Palace, the grounds had been home to the Königshäuschen, Ludwig’s fathers’ old hunting cottage. The cottage was dismantled and rebuilt in 1869 to make room for Linderhof. Though much smaller, the architecture of the magnificent palace is extravagant with ivory candelabras and a carpet made of ostrich down. Inspired by Versailles, Ludwig created a mirror image of “Sun King” Louis XIV’s bedchamber and styled himself the “Night King.” Like his Neuschwanstein Castle, Linderhof was also deeply inspired by composer Richard Wagner. Many rooms sport the themes of some of Wagner’s greatest works. Amidst the forested mountainous terrain, Ludwig built huge ornamental gardens that borrowed styles from a number of other countries and eras. Perhaps the most extravagant is the “Venus Grotto,” a man-made cave lake with a waterfall. Ludwig enjoyed rowing across it in a golden shell-shaped boat. Ludwig had 12  electrical dynamos installed for the illumination of the grotto.  Prepare for rain; it is common. The inside tour takes less than an hour to complete.

54,Badeschiff,"Berlin, Germany",Floating swimming pool within a moored vessel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/badeschiff,"City beaches are big business in Berlin, a city, which is glaringly missing a sea beach. Every summer, Berliners flock to lakes, numerous public swimming pools, as well as city beaches, strung like beads along the Spree river as it cuts right through the city center. Unfortunately, the Spree river itself is too polluted and too frequently used by ships to ensure safe swimming. Luckily, there is still the chance to bathe at the river without touching its filthy waters. The Badeschiff (literally Bathing Ship), moored near the eastern city center, is a large swimming pool, which was built inside the hollowed hull of an anchored vessel. The pool was designed by Susanne Lorenz as part of a competition for city arts projects, and was inaugurated in May 2004. Since then, the Badeschiff has become a favorite among Berliners and tourists alike trying to escape the mid-summer’s heat. During the summer months, an open air bar, sunbathing area, massages and sports classes are available at the pool’s location as well. After the summer season, a cocoon-like temporary roof is being built over the pool and the surrounding area, which holds two saunas and a lounge bar. The location also hosts regular concerts and parties, making it a year-round center for activity in Berlin.  The nearest S-Bahn station is Treptower Park.

56,Externsteine,"Horn-Bad Meinberg, Germany","Between Neo-Pagans and Neo-Nazis, these strange rock formations have a curious cult following and a very strange history.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/externsteine,"Externsteine, translated variously as “stones of the Egge” or, less convincingly, the “Star Stones,” is a series of pillar-like rock formations that jut up from the surrounding Teutoburg forest. No mere geological curiosity, Externsteine is also reputed to be an ancient and sacred palaeolithic worshiping ground, an astronomical calendar, and the location of a sacred pagan pillar known as an “Irminsul.” Externsteine is a current mecca for Neo-pagans, Neo-Nazis and neo-pagan-Nazis. In actuality, the pre-history of these rocks is largely unknown, and archaeological digs have turned up little to suggest they were of any great meaning to Paleolithic peoples. The odd rock formations were probably used as an occasional shelter until the late 700s when Christian monks settled at Externsteine and carved stairs and reliefs into the great stones. The site would continue to change purpose, serving as a fortress, pleasure palace, and prison before becoming something even stranger: a place famed for its history and spiritual significance despite the fact that the “history” is largely a fiction created by Nazi Occultists. The lack of evidence as to the ancient importance of the Externsteine rocks didn’t stop Heinrich Himmler from declaring otherwise. Himmler was the head of the Nazi’s occult division “Ahnenerbe,” a Nazi think tank that promoted itself as a “study society for Intellectual Ancient History.” In reality, it was a pseudo-scientific organization devoted to finding, or fabricating, a glorious Germanic past. One of the sites the society identified as an important location of ancient Teutonic activity was Externsteine and the “Externsteine Foundation” was set up to “investigate.” Pulled into the bizarre space where Nazism and Occult pseudo-history overlapped, the actual history of Externsteine was overshadowed by an entirely imagined ancient Teutonic history. Even the carvings of the monks were incorporated by Nazi pseudo-historian Himmler, with one in particular said to depict Christianity crushing a Teutonic pagan God-pillar known as an “Irminsul.” So far invested into this pseudo-history was Nazi Germany that according to author Gary R. Varner, the Nazi Youth gathered at Externsteine to sing pagan hymns during the solstice and on Hitler’s birthday. Today, the site remains in much the same historical chaos, with devotees of both Neo-Paganism and Neo-Nazism making pilgrimages to the site. Of course, other folks visit as well, and the site is fascinating even without the fictive history and cultural importance imputed to it. Made of five limestone pillars, the tallest over 100 feet tall, the site does indeed contain a number of astronomical elements (when they were created is still unclear) including a 20-inch window that aligns with the sun on the summer solstice. In addition, the stairs and relief carvings made by the monks add a real sense of meaning and awe to the place that has nothing to do with the crazed dreams of Nazi occultists. There is a Woodstock-like festival at Externsteine every year on the summer solstice.",cults hoaxes and pseudoscience strange science nazis outsider architecture geological oddities world war ii natural wonders geology military nature sacred spaces ruins
57,Tempelhof Airport,"Berlin, Germany",Berlin's old airport.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tempelhof-airport,"Tempelhof is Berlin’s oldest civilian airport. Built at a time when air travel was still in its infancy this airport exhibits many properties not found in modern airports. Works on future Tempelhof airport were started in 1923 by the German ministry of transport. At the time air travel was still a novelty, and prevalent idea was that it will be something akin to a railway travel. As railway terminals were most often placed in the centers of cities, location for new Berlin’s airport was chosen at the edge of city’s wider center, at the extensions of its main north-south axis, Frederickstrasse. The original terminal building, built in 1924, was replaced in the Nazi era by the current building designed by Prof. Ernst Sagebiel and the floor plan was designed to resemble an eagle’s spread wings in theme with the Nazi iconography. Construction of the eagle shaped building was interrupted by WWII, but the building is still one of the world’s largest in square footage, after the Parliament Palace built by former communist dictator Ceaucescou in Bucharest, Romania, several newer international airports, and the Pentagon in the US. There are four levels of tunnels and bunkers under Tempelhof airport, the lower two of which were burned and flooded by Russian troops before it was turned over to the US. Another feature of this airport, not found in its modern counterparts, is the giant canopy roof, high enough to accommodate most of the aircraft used by the airport even in the decades after WWII. The aircraft could taxi all the way to the building and under the canopy. Passengers could then board and disembark from the plane protected from the elements. The mile-long hangar roof was to have been laid in bleacher style tiers to form a stadium for spectators at air demonstrations. Tempelhof Airport ended up surrounded by urban development very quickly. Its awkward placement proved lucky for inhabitants of West Berlin, as it served as a drop off point of US organized airlift, during the Soviet blockade of the city in 1948. The airport remained in use throughout the Cold War. The northern half of the airport building was a US air force base until 1993, and many features remain, including the sprung-floor basketball court.  However the bowling alley has since been dismantled. In April of 2008, there was a referendum aimed at keeping Tempelhof Airport operational. However, this attempt at saving the airport failed. Ultimately, the pollution and hazards associated with a major airport in close proximity to residential areas motivated the shutdown of Tempelhof airport. The last commercial flight from Tempelhof happened on 30 October 2008. As of 2010, Templehof has been designated a huge park and public space, as well as bird/animal sanctuary. You can visit and go to Roller Disco or go for a run if you want to escape the hectic city. As of 2018, guided tours have been offered of the airport building several times per week. The entire building ihas been placed under German listed building status, and so provides a fascinating insight into its decades of history. From the center of the city take U6 metro line to the Platz der Luftbrücke. There is a station named Tempelhof on the same metro line but it's situated on the opposite end of the airfield.",architectural oddities architecture
58,Soviet Graffiti in the Reichstag,"Berlin, Germany",The walls of Germany's Parliament still show the scars of the Red Army takeover in World War II.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soviet-graffiti-reichstag,"Modern-day Berlin abounds with traces of the violence from 1945 when the Red Army ground its way through the city and the Nazi government made its last stand in the underground Fuherbunker. Public buildings from the era like the Pergamon Museum have facades that are still pockmarked by machine gun bullets and artillery shrapnel. One of the most evocative—and controversial—bits of scar tissue from World War II is found in the Bundestag itself, the home of Germany’s parliament, where some of the walls are still covered with graffiti left over from the Soviet takeover. The Reichstag (as the parliamentary building was then known) was a highly prized target by Joseph Stalin for its symbolic importance. Interestingly, while the Soviets thought of the Reichstag as “Hitler’s Lair” it was actually anything but—the German dictator loathed the Parliament and had never given a single speech there. Regardless, when the Soviets finally gained control of the building on May 2, 1945 the first thing they did was stage a photo op as a triumphant Hammer & Sickle flag was planted on the roof. After that, many wandered the rubble-filled hallways taking in the destruction, and sometimes pausing to reach down, take a piece of the ever-present charred wood, and scratch something onto the walls. “A dream came true” wrote Afanassev. “Moscow-Smolensk-Berlin” recorded another. Approximately 95% of the graffiti are simply names: “Ivanov,” “Pyotr,” “Victor, ” etc. Most of the graffiti was in Russian; a sooty word cloud of Cyrillic names, vulgarities and reflections. Other languages like Arabic can also be found in some places, reflecting the vast swath of territory that contributed manpower to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. “Bashkir” and “Groznyj” are two of the examples, referring to Bashkiria and Chechnya respectively. The Soviet vandals’ fingerprints on the Reichstag were largely forgotten about in the postwar period when shabby repair work covered up the interior damage with paneling. And that’s the way it stayed for half a century, until the reunified German nation set about restoring their capitol building for a post-Cold War future. In 1995 British Architect Norman Foster ripped out the paneling and was amazed to discover the text inscribed on the stone underneath. Foster was profoundly affected by the time machine-like power of the letters and he modified the architectural plans in order to preserve them. Historical appreciation was far from unanimous, however. Politicians like newly elected Johannes Singhammer (Now VP of the Bundestag) rejected the Soviet graffiti as hateful. “Death to the Germans,” and “The Russians were here and always beat the Germans,” are two notable examples. The preservationist and self-confessional school of thought ended up prevailing inside the refurbished (and renamed) Bundestag, as it did all across Berlin. As then Parliamentary President Rita Süssmuth later told The Atlantic, “this makes us stronger, not weaker. It makes humanity stronger.” Today you can see the graffiti on publicly available tours of the Bundestag.

59,Fliegeberg,"Berlin, Germany",This conical hill was built as a testing ground for an engineer known as the Glider King.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fliegeberg,"Berlin’s Fliegeberg (literally “Fly Mountain”) is a 15-meter-tall artificial hill erected by Otto Lilienthal, the first person to successfully make repeated, well-documented flights in heavier-than-air gliders. The hill now stands in the middle of a park named after him, built as a memorial to the flight pioneer. Lilienthal was born in the town of Anklam, in the Prussian province of Pomerania in 1848. He was fascinated by the flight of birds, to the point of building sets of artificial wings with the help of his brother, Gustav. There is no evidence of these early flying machines working, but they set Otto on a path that would eventually put flight in human hands. He began working as an engineer, and would later go on to found his own machine company, producing steam engines. However, he never stopped doing research into the flight of birds — storks in particular — and continued to test gliders of his own design. His first public test was in 1891, at the Windmühlenberg (“Windmill Mountain”) near Potsdam. Over the course of the next several years, he conducted tests at several locations, until, in 1894, he built the Fliegeberg near his home in Lichterfelde, now a part of Berlin. His tests here would often draw crowds, and the flat land surrounding the hill allowed the tests to be photographed. As word of his flights spread across the world, he became known as the “Glider King.” Otto Lilienthal’s last flight occurred on August 9, 1896. He was testing a new glider design in the hills near the town of Rhinow, a place where he had conducted tests previously. During the flight, Lilienthal tried to lower the glider, but pitched too far forward, and found himself pointing directly downwards. Despite his best efforts, Lilienthal could not regain control; both he and the glider fell headlong to the earth from a height of 15 meters, breaking Lilienthal’s neck. He died the next day. At the time of Lilienthal’s death, he had patented 25 glider designs, which would go on to inspire other early flyers, including the Wright Brothers. His testing ground became Lilienthalpark in 1900, and in 1932, a monument to Lilienthal’s memory was built at the Fliegeberg’s peak. The unveiling ceremony was attended by Gustav Lilienthal and Paul Beylich, who was one of Otto’s main assistants (both are honored with small concrete plaques at the base of the hill). The monument was designed by the architect Fritz Freymüller, and takes the form of a bronze globe surrounded by a circular pavilion that is open in the middle, leaving the globe exposed to the sky. The original globe was melted down during World War II and was eventually replaced in 1990 (after having been replaced by a stone sphere in 1955). The current globe is inscribed with the paths of famous flights, in honor of the great achievements that Otto Lilienthal inspired, but never lived to see. While far from any U- or S-Bahn stations, the park has a conveniently placed bus stop near the entrance: Lilienthalpark, on line 284.",aviation engineering memorials
60,Auerworld Palace,"Auerstedt, Germany",Living trees form the structure of an open-air palace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/auerworld-palace,"Weaving live saplings together to form a kind of domed cathedral space, architect Marcel Kalberer and his group Sanfte Strukturen are re-envisioning the way living building materials and techniques can be used to design modern spaces. Constructed in 1998, the Auerworld Palace in Auerstedt, Germany was their first “willow palace’ project, taking the efforts of 300 volunteers to build. The palace is now 10 years old - their techniques, however, are ancient. The Sumerian reed houses of Mesopotamia were famous for their construction of tightly bound reeds, and in Europe smaller outbuildings have been made of woven plants and trees for hundreds of years. Most of these are built from green branches, though. In this case the whole tree is woven in place to form a living structure. Kalberer began his first construction in 1984 and since then has built more than 70 structures around Europe. He has also shared and explained his technique to others, and according to Kalberer, there are now more than 10,000 small willow constructions at schools and in private gardens around Germany.The Auerworld Palace is also the home to full moon dance parties known as the Auerworld Festivals, which have been going on since 1998, when this living palace was first created.

61,Weiße Rose Pavement Memorial,"Munich, Germany",These bronze pamphlets remember a remarkable group of Germans who fearlessly opposed the Nazis in the very center of their power.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/weisse-rose-pavement-memorial,"It’s not difficult to find vestiges of Third Reich history in Munich - after all, the city served as the NSDAP’s official and ideological stronghold for years leading up to World War II. However, tourists are only rarely told the story of the Weiße Rose (White Rose), a group of student rebels led by siblings Hans and Sophie Scholl, who practiced non-violent resistance and were later executed by the Nazi authorities. Today, the Scholl siblings are probably Germany’s best known domestic resistance activists during WWII, though they are little known outside their home country. Most White Rose members were students at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, one of Germany’s oldest and most highly regarded universities. Most of the members had previously been members of the Hitler Jugend or the Bund Deutscher Mädel, and their exposure to Nazi policies and ideologies gradually led them to reject the tenets of National Socialism being imposed upon German youth at the time. The group’s actions consisted mostly of distributing inflammatory leaflets to the German intelligentsia, as well as spreading political graffiti throughout Munich and other southern German cities. On February 18, 1943, members of the White Rose, including the Scholl siblings, distributed leaflets in the university’s main atrium (which now contains the White Rose Organ as well as a small museum dedicated to the group located beneath the largest lecture hall of the university), and were arrested by the Gestapo and interrogated. They were executed by guillotine beheading on February 22. However, their final leaflet was successfully smuggled to Allied troops and later dropped out of planes across Germany, leading to posthumous recognition of the group’s activities and heroism in the postwar era. There are several memorials to the White Rose scattered throughout Munich, though the most powerful reminder of their deeds can be found embedded in the cobblestone pavement in front of the university building where the founding members were originally arrested. Bronze replicas of White Rose leaflets are scattered haphazardly across the sidewalk - Sophie Scholl is said to have thrown her remaining leaflets into the air upon spotting the Gestapo coming to arrest them. The square in which the memorial can be found now bears the name “Geschwister-Scholl-Platz” (“Scholl Siblings Square”), and a bust of Sophie Scholl can also be found inside the law school atrium. Though rarely traversed by most tourists visiting the city, the square and its memorials serve as a chilling yet inspiring reminder of the ideological strife that divided Germany during the Third Reich era.",world war ii memorials monuments military

A 146-meter-tall lattice tower, the tower has a restaurant at height of 51.65 meters and an open air observation deck at 121.49 meters. There is a unique feature of the radio tower, which is that its feet stand on large porcelain insulators, insulating it from the ground. Towers standing on insulators are not uncommon on long- and medium-wave broadcasting sites, but these towers are not normally open for tourists, as they have high voltage, and are dangerous. The Berlin tower, which was built between 1924 and 1926—and was always intended to be open to tourists—almost had the same problem. After it was completed, it was discovered that it would be nearly impossible to get tourists on the insulated tower without endangering them. Eventually the broadcasting element of the tower was scrapped in favor of the tourists, and the Berlin Radio Tower was turned into merely a nice place to get a meal and look out over the city, which it still is today.

The Beelitz Heilstatten hospital’s history lives up to its dark visage. Built in 1898, this disused hospital complex of approximately 60 buildings located in the district of Beelitz Heilstatten. Between 1898 and 1930 the complex served as a sanatorium for lung diseases, generally housing those with then-fatal conditions such as tuberculosis. During the first world war it served as a field hospital that treated the earliest casualties of such new weapons as machine guns and mustard gas. During this time it also treated a young soldier by the name of Adolf Hitler, who had been blinded by a British gas attack and wounded in the leg at the Battle of the Somme (This earned him the Iron Cross). Ironically, these experiences and his successful treatment would set the stage for the hospital to once again be used as a field hospital, treating wounded Nazi’s during WWII. Occupied by the Russians in 1945, it served as a Soviet military hospital for the next 50 years until 1995, long after the fall of the Berlin wall. The hospital treated everyone from Communist party members to the disgraced head of the East German government who was sent there after being forced out in 1990. Today, while a few small sections of the enormous hospital are used for neurological rehabilitation and Parkinson’s research, the majority of the complex, including the surgery ward, the psychiatric ward, and a rifle range, have all been abandoned and left to decay back into the surrounding forest. In 2002 it was used as a set for the Roman Polanski film ‘The Pianist’. As none of the complex was guarded until 2015, it was a popular place for urban exploration, drinking teenagers, and people looking to give themselves a good scare. In 2015 the ruins were outfitted with a canopy pathway, which allows to view the ruins on every level without need to enter them. Now it’s less an adventure and more of an tourist attraction. But it hasn’t lost the charm and is now fully accessible for walking-impaired persons.  Many of the buildings are securely gated off. There are tours available, but they don't really show you much. There is still a fair share of buildings of the complex that can be explored, but many of the more attractive buildings are (legally) inaccessible. The canopy pathway covers the main buildings for male and female patients, kitchen and some other buildings. For the canopy pathway you need to buy a ticket, but there are still large parts of the complex which are free to explore without ticket.",abandoned hospitals nazis abandoned ruins
64,The Oracle of Delphi,Greece,The hallucinogenic center of the ancient world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-oracle-of-delphi-greece,"For ancient Greeks, Delphi was the center of the world: a site sacred to the god Apollo, where all Greeks united to worship. But at its heart was a dark, strange place: the mysterious sanctuary where the priestess of Apollo prophesied. The priestess, called the Pythia, sat above a chasm in the earth, which belched forth fumes. She breathed deeply – some believe that the fumes possessed hallucinogenic properties - and slipped into semi-consciousness. Her prophecies were opaque, often frantic. This was the Oracle of Delphi: the Greeks’ most famous and most feared window into the will of the gods. It lay in “a cavern hollowed down in the depths” of the hillside, as the historian Strabo reported, underneath the great Temple of Apollo. Today, the ruins of the Temple sit on the slopes of Mount Parnassus. It was destroyed by the Emperor Theodosius I, in 390 CE, in an attempt to eradicate the old pagan beliefs. Few traces of the Oracle remain, but the site is still an eerie one: mist clings to the hills, and you can almost hear the ghosts of Croesus, Nero, and Alexander.",cults rites and rituals ruins
65,Meteora,"Kalabaka, Greece","Monasteries on rock pillars, once accessible only by frayed ropes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/meteora,"The Orthodox church has always had a knack for picking spectacular locations for its sacred buildings, and Meteora is no exception. Even if it weren’t the location of the second most important monastery complex in Greece, Meteora would still be a site worthy of awe. In the foothills of the Pindus mountains, above the central Greek plains of Thessaly, is a series of geological wonders that stick out from the ground. The name Meteora means “suspended in the air” or “suspended rocks” and it is appropriate. Wind, water, and the harsh temperatures have carved out a series of gigantic sandstone pillars, some of them hundreds of meters high. The first hermit monks appeared in this area as early as the 11th century, however the monastery complex only began to flourish after the Ottoman conquest of Byzantine empire in 1453. Due to persecution and concern about the Ottomans, orthodox monks sought refuge in increasingly remote locations. What better place to establish a monastery then in, as Meteora is sometimes translated, “the heavens above”? To gain access to the monastery one originally had to climb a series of ladders tied together or be dragged up via a large net. According to the monks the ropes up to Meteora were only replaced “when the Lord let them break.” Today steps have been carved into the rock and a bridge built from a nearby plateau. At its peak the complex included 20 monasteries, however only six of them remain today; five are for men only, and the sixth for women. Great Meteora is the largest and most often visited by tourists. Roussanou is located on a relatively smaller rock, and this makes it an excellent point for spectacular photos of the Varlaam monastery and of the Metamorfosis church.  Each monastery has slightly different open hours so some planning up ahead is needed if one intends to visit all 6 monasteries. Proper attire is required, skirts below the knee length for women and long pants for men.",long now locations monasteries sacred spaces
66,Sami,Greece,A spectacular cave and a beguiling lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sami,"Sami, located on the Greek island of Kefolonia (sometimes spelt Cephalonia) boasts two magnificent geological oddities: Drogarati Cave and Melissani Lake. The short distance between the two allows tourists to visit both of these natural wonders in one day. Lake Melissani was given its name after archaeological excavations in 1951 and 1962 revealed Minoan depictions of the nymph Melissanthi and the god Pan. The lake itself was created many years ago when a huge underground cavern collapsed, leaving a large circular opening to the surface. Between 11am and 1pm on sunny days, Lake Melissani is an otherworldly blue. Three hundred years ago, the Drogarati Cave was discovered after an earthquake opened up a previously closed entrance, but it was not until 1963 that the cave was opened to the public. Those who have been fortunate enough to visit are treated to its beautiful stalagmites and stalactites. The largest room in the cave, “Sala of Apotheosis,” is 900 meters square and illuminated. It is often used for concerts because of its outstanding acoustics. The published coordinates will take you to the Melissani Lake. The most stunning of the two attractions on the island.

67,Navagio Beach,"Zakinthos, Greece",Hidden in a secluded Greek cove is a pristine beach marred only by the rusting smuggler's hulk stranded on its shores.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/navagio-beach,"The island of Zakynthos is a jagged little piece of land off the southwest coast of Greece that features a number of rocky coves cut off from the mainland. In one of these secluded bits of paradise is Navagio Beach, a sandy little strip that would be remarkable for its beauty, but is made more so by the crumbling remains of a smuggler’s shipwreck. Also known as “Shipwreck Beach” and “Smuggler’s Cove,” the beach became a mini ship graveyard in 1983 when the shipping vessel known as the Panagiotis crashed on the scenic shore in Zakynthos Greece. According to reports, the ship was smuggling cigarettes, booze, and maybe even humans when the authorities caught onto the trail and chased it through bad weather, right into the cove, where it ran aground. Ever since the crash, the hulk has sat on the shore slowly falling apart. The crash site soon became a popular destination for vacationers looking not only for an untouched beach but called by the siren song of the decaying ship. As the bulkhead of the ship rust away the hull seems to be sinking into the sands, but most of the vessel still sits on the beach. Today, the beach is still a popular site for people looking to get off the beaten path, although the path is often beaten by hundreds of others at peak times. The beach was prominently featured in the Descendants of the Sun Korean drama, which led to a surge of interest among Korean and Chinese tourists.  The ship is only accessible from sea, and most tour operators on the island run day trips. Some tours run only in high season from April to October. The best time to visit the beach is early morning before the hordes of tourists spoil the landscape.",shipwrecks beaches hidden
68,Antikythera Mechanism,"Athens, Greece",2000-year-old computer demonstrates remarkable engineering and astronomical precision.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antikythera-mechanism,"For over 2,000 years, a shipwreck lay off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera, its hidden treasures slowly corroded by the Mediterranean. It wasn’t until 1900 that sponge divers happened upon the loot, and found therein a perplexing device of remarkable engineering - though the divers had no idea how truly remarkable it was at the time. The device sat in a museum for fifty years before historians began to take a serious look at it. Known as the Antikythera mechanism and called a “clockwork computer,” this small bronze instrument is unique because it precedes any machine of comparable complexity by more than a millennium. The mechanism was built circa 200 BC, and, with over thirty gears hidden behind its dials, it is easily the most advanced technological artifact of the pre-Christian period. Regarded as the first known analog computer, the mechanism can make precise calculations based on astronomical and mathematical principles developed by the ancient Greeks. Although its builder’s identity and what it was doing aboard a ship remain mysteries, scientists have worked for a century to piece together the mechanism’s history. Somewhat surprisingly, most consider it unlikely that the Antikythera mechanism was a navigational tool. The harsh environment at sea would have presented a danger to the instrument’s delicate gears, and features such as eclipse predictions are unnecessary for navigation. The mechanism’s small size, however, does suggest that it was designed with portability in mind. According to some researchers, a more plausible story is that the mechanism was used to teach astronomy to those with little knowledge of the subject. To use the instrument, you would simply enter a date using a crank, and, when the gears stopped spinning, a wealth of information appear at your fingertips: the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, the lunar phase, the dates of upcoming solar eclipses, the speed of the Moon through the sky, and even the dates of the Olympic games. Perhaps most impressively, the mechanism’s calendar dial could compensate for the extra quarter-day in the astronomical year by turning the scale back one day every four years. The Julian calendar, which was the first in the region to include leap years, was not introduced until decades after the instrument was built. While the Antikythera mechanism is the only known artifact of its kind, its precise engineering and the fact that similar instruments were described in contemporary writing lend strong support to the notion that it was not unique. It is thought that the famous inventor Archimedes of Syracuse constructed comparable devices. Some believe that the instrument came from the school of the astronomer Hipparchus. Whoever the builder was, they were likely Greek, as evidenced by the written instructions that are attached to the instrument’s face. Today, the Antikythera mechanism is housed is in the Bronze Collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. A replica of the mechanism is also on view at the American Computer Museum in Bozeman, Montana. When Jacques-Yves Cousteau made his last visit to the shipwreck in 1978, he found no additional pieces. Nevertheless, the device continues to reveal its secrets to the researchers of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project, an international effort supported by various universities and technology companies.",astounding timepieces long now locations retro-tech instruments of science inventions collections
69,Tourlitis Lighthouse,"Andros, Greece","Perched on a spindly rock spire in a Greek archipelago, this lighthouse would make a perfect wizard's tower.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tourlitis-lighthouse,"As lighthouses go, you can’t get much more evocative than the Tourlitis Lighthouse off the coast of the Greek port city of Andros. Rising up out of a weather-worn stone spire, the beacon looks like something straight out of a fantasy novel. The lighthouse was first built in 1897 just off shore from a castle in Andros. The stone column on which it was built had been shaped by millennia of natural erosion into the perfect pedestal for a coastal beacon. Unfortunately the original lighthouse was not long for this world, and was destroyed during World War II. For a time, the rocky outcropping went without a proper lighthouse, and the fantastical image created by the former structure was all but lost. However, the lovely beacon apparently had an extra life. The lighthouse was eventually rebuilt in the early 1990s by an oil tycoon who dedicated the structure to his daughter. The replica became Greece’s first automated lighthouse, eliminating the need for an onsite keeper to operate the light. But even with the modern upgrade, the lighthouse still looks like something out of Dungeon and Dragons, with the winding staircase hewn from the rock itself, leading up to the door of the tower. Since its renovation, it has become one of the area’s foremost tourist attractions, drawing lighthouse peepers and photographers who come to gawk at its singular beauty.",flooded towers fantasy lighthouses architecture
70,The Athenian Agora,"Athens, Greece",This ancient Greek place of assembly and marketplace is being revealed layer by layer below the modern Athens cityscape.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-athenian-agora-athens-greece,"Lying right beneath the northern slope of the Acropolis is the ancient Athenian Agora. Walking through the Agora takes the visitor back through the place where Athens’s mighty heart once beat. Literally meaning “marketplace,” the Agora was the economic center, where the wealth, reach and influence of classical Athens was visible by the wide range of goods shipped in from the nearby port of Piraeus, which ranged from wheat produced on the shores of the Black Sea to precious dyes from the Levant. But what marked the Agora with everlasting glory was the other commodity traded and peddled daily: ideas. The Agora was the meeting grounds and hang out spot for ancient Athenians, where members of the elected democracy assembled to discuss affairs of state, noblemen came to conduct business, ordinary citizens got together to meet up with friends and watch performers, and where the famed philosophers doused their listeners with wisdom (or rubbish). The Agora also played serious a role in religious festivals. The architectural layout of the Agora was centered around the Panathenaic Way, a road the ran through the heart of Athens to the main gate of the city, the Dipylon. The road was sacred, serving as the travel route for the Panathenaic festival, held in honor of the city’s patron goddess Athena every four years. The Agora was also home to the Temple of Hephaestus, the Greek god of craftsmen and metalworking. It was thought for many years to be a temple dedicated to Theseus, the founding mythological hero of Athens, but this turned out to be wrong. The temple is still visible in great condition, and is one of the best-preserved classical temples in all of Greece. Other temples formerly standing at the Agora include temples dedicated to Zeus, Athena, Apollo, and Ares. Notable buildings include the city’s arsenal, the Tholos (where the city’s elected generals lived on the public’s dime) and the numerous stoas- Stoa Baileios, Stoa Poikile, and the Stoa of Attalos to name a few. Stoas were massive covered porticos designed for public usage, where merchants could sell their goods and where people could catch some shade on a scorching summer day. The Stoa of Attalos was rebuilt in the 1950’s and houses both the Agora Museum and the storage and conservation facilities of the Agora’s ongoing archaeological excavation. Most of what’s visible and known of the Athenian Agora was a mystery until excavations by the American School in Athens began in 1934. Much of the site was actually covered by a refugee camp made up of Greeks who fled Turkey during the events following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The excavations uncovered most of the 30+ known major buildings from the ancient Athenian Agora, along with thousands of artifacts. Conservation efforts have restored thousands of pieces of pottery and amphora (the standard storage vessel of the ancient world), studied thousands of marble statues and reliefs, and analyzed the remains of human and animal bones to give us a better understanding of what life was like in the ancient Athenian world. The excavation is ongoing, with a digging team made up of highly qualified students of classics, archaeology, and occasionally economics or oceanography present every summer to get their Indiana Jones on, most of which involves constant squatting in the hot Greek sun, pickaxing through layers of never-ending dirt, and sweeping all of the dirt and rocks away to reveal pottery, walls, bones, coins, but often…more dirt. In the summer of 2010, the excavation tackled the Stoa Poikile, or the Painted Stoa. It was the hang-out spot of people looking to relax and watch fire-eaters, as well as a testament to Athen’s glory days, housing four famous (but now lost) paintings known throughout the ancient world: a battle of Theseus against the Amazons, the siege of Troy, the Battle of Oenoe (Athen’s first major victory over Sparta), and the Battle of Marathon (Athen’s victory that stopped Persian the advancing Persian army). The Painted Stoa was also the meeting place of the philosopher Xeno and his students, and it is from this building that his disciples derived the name “Stoics.” Other sites to see in or around the Athenian Agora include the Church of the Holy Apostles (a Byzantine Church built around 1000 CE), the Roman Agora, the Areopagus (a hill where city affairs were managed prior to the democracy), the Pnyx (a hill where city affairs were managed once it became a democracy), the ancient cemetery at Keameikos, and of course the Acropolis.",relics and reliquaries repositories of knowledge sacred spaces ruins
71,Mycenae,"Argolis, Greece",This legendary city has been a tourist attraction for centuries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mycenae,"On a hilltop among hilltops on the Peloponnesian peninsula in Greece, an ancient stillness pervades the poppy-strewn countryside and muffles the bells of nearby sheep with their shepherds. And yet the tour buses continuously rumble up to the ancient stone remnants of a great city. Stone lions gaze upward even as round tombs huddle deeper into the earth. This is Mycenae, once the major power in the Bronze Age and Helladic Greece, controlling most of southern Greece and communicating with other trading centers as far away as Crete and Egypt, but no more than a tourist attraction since Roman times. This is the home of larger than life literary and mythological figures, from the hero Perseus to the bloody dynasty of the house of Atreus. Mycenae was also the kingdom of Agamemnon, who pursued his brother’s wayward bride (and the riches she hid among) to the far shores of Troy. Ill winds at the outset of the Greek army’s journey persuaded the king to sacrifice his own daughter to gain godly favor and precipitated an equally bloody chain of events upon his return home 10 years later. His vengeful wife Clytemnestra and her lover killed Agamemnon in the bath, the writer Aeschylus says in his Oresteia trilogy, which in turn led Agamemnon and Clytemnestra’s son Orestes to seek revenge for his father. When amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, fresh from his excavations at Troy, came to Mycenae in 1874, he began a large, systematic excavation and maintained his zeal for finding evidence of his beloved Homeric epics. Excavations uncovered a plethora of shaft graves, many of which contained a wealth of grave goods, including weapons, jewels, and beaten gold death masks. Despite the date of these tombs being quite a bit earlier than the layer of Troy he believed to be in contact with the Mycenaeans, Schliemann famously said upon finding the golden mask of a particularly serious bearded man, “I have gazed upon the face of Agamemnon.” The mask has retained this moniker and is on view at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, along with other finds from the site. Perhaps the most famous feature of the site is the set of beehive tombs (tholoi). The tholoi marked a transition in burial practices from the earlier shaft graves and, while their grand nature implies the presence of important individuals, their visibility also made them easy prey for looters, and little was found within them. Also of note are the slippery stone steps that lead down into the hillside to the long-filled-in remnants of an ancient cistern. Fed by a spring outside the city walls, the secret cistern gave the Mycenaeans access to water even if the city came under siege. Although Schleimann harbored a romantic hope of finding his beloved Homeric heroes in the remnants of Mycenae, the wealthy residents of the shaft graves predate even the cyclopean walls of Mycenae’s citadel. However, if we allow that the characters in the works of Homer and other poets are not rooted in a concrete timeline, but are echoes of earlier figures and events that were so important that they were passed on through the ages in the collective memory of the ancient Greeks, it is easy to believe that we have gazed upon the face of Agamemnon as well.",lost cities unesco ancient archaeology ruins
72,Knossos,"Heraklion, Greece","A minotaur, a labyrinth, and a dubious restoration pull in visitors from around the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/knossos-crete,"In northern Crete, near the modern city of Heraklion lies the ruins of Knossos, a city dating back to 7000 B.C. that was once home to a number of famous Greek myths and is now a popular tourist attraction. According to Greek mythology, King Minos built his palace at Knossos. Daedulus, a craftsman and brilliant inventor, built the labyrinth to house Pasiphea’s son, the minotaur, under King Minos’s order. The labyrinth was a huge seemingly never-ending maze located under the court of King Minos. Unfortunately, much of this legend is unverifiable as the Palace of Knossos was destroyed by fire around 1450 BC, and the surrounding town was left deserted and was eventually lost to time. However, after centuries of existing only in myth, thanks to the work of a British archaeologist Knossos was put back on the map. In 1900 Arthur Evans bought several acres of land near Crete, hoping to find evidence of the historical reign of Minos. He began to dig and over the course of 25 years of work he uncovered layer after layer of finds including the ruins of a spectacular palace. Having decided that this was the palace of Minos, he set about restoring it. It is this restoration which visitors (over a million a year) flock to today. As Mary Beard explored in the New York Review of Books, the restored site is more than a little curious. Very few of the sights are original, such as the famous frescoes of Knossos which are (barring a few corners here and there) entirely modern. Much of the exhibit is even outrageously wrong, with Evans himself admitting that he had relied on “educated guesses.” The author Evelyn Waugh, visiting in 1930, remarked of the site, “It is impossible to disregard the suspicion that their painters [of the restored frescoes of Knossos] have tempered their zeal for accurate reconstruction with a somewhat inappropriate predilection for covers of Vogue.” Cathy Gere, the author of a recent study of Knossos, noted that this “ancient” palace in fact “enjoys the dubious distinction of being one of the first reinforced concrete buildings ever erected on the island.’ Knossos is a fine place to wander, though less to glimpse the world of ancient myth and more to see how successive generations reinterpret their own past.",labyrinths mazes mythology monuments ruins
73,Lycabettus Funicular,"Athens, Greece","The railway carts travelers to central Athens's highest peak, which offers stunning vistas of the city.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lycabettus-funicular,"Running from the lower terminus in Kolonaki to the upper terminus atop Mount Lycabettus, the Lycabettus Funicular takes passengers on a 680-foot underground journey up to the highest peak in central Athens. Mount Lycabettus sits 908 feet above sea level. In 1960, construction began on a funicular railway that would take visitors to the top of the mountain. After much digging and hauling, the Lycabettus Funicular was inaugurated on April 18, 1965. The funicular ran uninterrupted for 38 years until 2002, when the carriages were replaced and the mechanical and electrical systems were renovated. Now, each car has a capacity of 34 people and the funicular transports an average of 300,000 riders annually. Atop the mountain is a panoramic view of all of Athens. On the higher peak is the 19th-century Chapel of Saint George, a tiny Cycladic-style chapel that was first used by a Monk in 1834 and sits on the grounds of an ancient temple dedicated to the God Zeus as well as a café and restaurant. On the lower peak sits a 4,000-seat Amphitheater.  The Lycabettus Funicular generally runs daily between 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. Hours may vary based on seasonal conditions. Two carriages start simultaneously every 30 minutes (more often at peak times) at the opposite terminus and move on a single track that intersects at the midpoint. The length of the journey is 210 meters and a one-way trip lasts three minutes. Those prone to claustrophobia or motion sickness should take the environment into consideration before deciding whether to use the funicular. Guests that wish to visit the chapel must climb several dozen steps to get to the peak where it is located. Dress codes vary from church to church in Greek orthodoxy. If you wish to enter the chapel, a show of respect to the chapel and its members is achieved by modest clothing and proper behavior. For men shorts, tank tops/sleeveless shirts and sandals/flip flops are frowned upon. Women's shoulders should not be shown in church so anything strapless or with thin straps should be avoided. Skirts and dresses should at a minimum come below the knee. Some churches ask that no leg be shown. Keep your feet on the ground when seated, because it is considered insulting for your feet to face holy images.",funicular tunnels railroads transportation subterranean sites
74,Anafiotika,"Athens, Greece",The Cycladic architecture makes this Athens neighborhood feel like an island paradise hidden in the shadow of the Acropolis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anafiotika,"Just below the north slope of the Acropolis and above Plaka is Anafiotika is a tiny neighborhood of whitewashed houses built according to Cycladic architecture. Wandering among these houses will make you feel as though you’ve been transported to a Greek island. In 1840, experienced builders from the island of Anafi came to Athens to work on the new Royal Palace and excavation sites around the Acropolis. Taking advantage of a law that decreed that if you could put up a structure between sunset and sunrise the property became yours, these builders hastily built houses on the steep hillside. They called their settlement Anafiotika, (“Little Anafi”), after their island. There are no stores, cafés or souvenir shops, just small whitewashed houses with bright shutters built on narrow streets with many bougainvillea-covered walls. But though the settlement is charming, its history has been difficult. Most of the original village was destroyed in 1950 for archaeological research. In 1970, the Greek government began buying houses and demolished 20 more of them. There are fewer than 50 houses left, most of them inhabited by the descendants of the original Anafi families. Current owners of the houses are prohibited from selling or transferring them to non-family members, the only other option being selling them to the Greek government. The area is home to several Byzantine churches, including the 11th-century Church of the Metamorphosis Sotiros, which has a rear grotto carved into the Acropolis; the 17th-century Monastery of the Holy Sepulchre, where the Holy Light first arrives from Jerusalem on the evening of Holy Saturday during Easter week; and the 17th0century Church of St. George of the Rock, which has a garden  memorializing the Evzone Konstantinos Koukidis who wrapped himself in the Greek flag he was guarding and leaped off the Acropolis when the Germans invaded Athens in 1941.  Google maps shows Anafiotika located on the south slope of the Acropolis. This is wrong as it is on the north slope. Dress codes vary from church to church in Greek orthodoxy. If you wish to enter any of the churches, a show of respect to the church and its members is achieved by modest clothing and proper behavior. For men, shorts, tank tops/sleeveless shirts, and sandals/flip flops are frowned upon. Women's shoulders should not be shown in church, so anything strapless or with thin straps should be avoided.

75,Hadrian's Reservoir,"Athens, Greece",This ancient hydrological marvel is now the base of a modern outdoor cinema.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hadrians-reservoir,"One of Roman Athens’ most amazing engineering feats now lies below a modern outdoor movie theater. Fans of the silver screen can gather beneath the night air to watch their favorite films, all while perched atop a nearly 2,000-year-old reservoir. Due to Athens’ growing water needs in the second century CE, Emperor Hadrian ordered a project to increase the city’s water supply. Construction thus started in 125 for an aqueduct that began at Mount Parnitha and stretched more than 12 miles to the base of Mount Lycabettus, where a reservoir was built. The aqueduct consisted primarily of an underground channel constructed manually through solid rock. When completed in 140 CE, it was Athens’ largest infrastructure project to date. Hadrian’s Reservoir sits at the western base of Mt. Lycabettus. Pipes originating there provided enough water to cover the needs of the area’s residents for over 1,000 years. The structure had a propylon (destroyed in the late 18th-century) with four Ionic columns and an architrave with a dedication to Hadrian and his successor Antoninus Pius, during whose reign the work was completed. The reservoir was abandoned during the Ottoman Empire’s occupation, causing most residents to become reliant on wells. Restoration of the aqueduct began in 1847, though it ceased to be a main source of water after the construction of the Marathon Dam in 1929. Today, it no longer supplies drinking water. Some water from the reservoir still makes it to the end, though it empties right into the sewer. Currently, only parts of the steps and two column bases remain at the site. A portion of the architrave also still exists, though it currently sits in the National Gardens.  The reservoir sits in Dexameni (Reservoir) Square, beneath Cinema Dexameni. Access inside the reservoir building is restricted; however, there are large viewing portals on the western walls that offer a great view inside. Annually on January 6, the Epiphany, the Greek Orthodox ritual of the “Blessing of the Waters” is held in front of the reservoir. During this ritual, the reservoir is opened and the water is blessed by a priest, who immerses a cross in the water and then sprinkles followers with the now-holy water. If you wish to view the portion of the architrave that still exists, it sits in the National Gardens near the Children's Library.",reservoir movie palace aqueducts urban planning infrastructure water

And according to some, that’s exactly the point, as it’s thought the ancient Greeks may have used the sphere in magic rituals. The large marble sphere was found in 1866 at the Theater of Dionysus, which stands at the foot of the famed Acropolis. It’s believed the curious orb was created sometime between the second and third centuries CE. Not much is known about the strange sphere. Because it was found buried near the Theater of Dionysus—a place where duels and various sporting events were held—it’s said the ball may have been used in magic rituals by those hoping to win. The carvings adorning the sphere are mysterious and mystical. Most agree the human figure is a depiction of Helios, the god of the Sun. He sits atop a grand throne, clutching a whip in one hand and three lit torches in the other. A great beast rests at his feet, which is said to be either a lion or a dog and is thought to represent a constellation. Other animal and celestial symbols cover the rest of the sphere.

78,Prehistoric Town of Akrotiri,"Santorini, Greece",A Bronze age settlement on the Greek island of Santorini might have been the inspiration for Plato's Atlantis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prehistoric-town-of-akrotiri,"Tucked away at the southern tip of Santorini are the ruins of one of the Bronze age’s most sophisticated settlements, which prospered for centuries before being eradicated by a great volcanic eruption. Like the Roman ruins of Pompeii, the remains of the Minoan town of Akrotiri are remarkably well-preserved. The settlement was all but obliterated in the middle of the second millennium BC, when the volcano it sat upon, Thera, erupted, and its inhabitants fled. The volcanic matter enveloped the entire island of Santorini and the town itself, preserving the buildings and their contents, and visitors can still identify houses and pots. Unlike Pompeii, no human remains have been found at Akrotiri, and only one gold object was found on the site, suggesting that the Minoans performed an orderly evacuation before the eruption, and they had time to take their valuables before they fled. The Minoan civilization existed on Crete and its surrounding Greek islands, and flourished from approximately 3600 BC to 1400 BC. The eruption of Thera has been credited with its demise; geologists have called it the most destructive natural event in recorded history. The town of Akrotiri was an outpost of Crete which dates back to the third millennium BC and gradually developed into one of the main ports and urban centers of the Aegean. Akrotiri was incredibly sophisticated for its time. The buildings in the town were multi-storeyed and faced with masonry, and the elaborate drainage system was highly evolved–it is here that we see some of the first instances of indoor lavatories. The town’s elaborate architecture and vivid frescoes indicate a highly cultured settlement. It is perhaps this level of sophistication that has lead scholars and historians to believe that Akrotiri served as Plato’s inspiration for the city of Atlantis. In his dialogues Timaios and Kritias, Plato wrote of an island on which there was “a great and wonderful empire,” which was suddenly destroyed. “There occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth,” Plato wrote, “and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea.” Some scholars have argued that Plato’s description of the sudden obliteration of Atlantis is parallel to the eruption of Thera and the subsequent destruction of Akrotiri. Since “Akrotiri” is a modern name given to the settlement after the nearby town of the same name, there is no way of knowing what the original inhabitants knew their home as–perhaps it was “Atlantis.”  After being closed for a number of years for repair work, the archeological site has reopened to visitors, and can be accessed by car or bus from Fira.Open hours between November and March: from 08.00 to 15.00, every day except Monday.Open hours between April to October: from 08.00 to 20.00, every day.

79,Tower of the Winds,"Athens, Greece",An ancient octagonal weather station named for the eight Greek gods of wind.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tower-of-the-winds,"Most archaeological sites in Athens are old temples, but this ancient structure had a scientific purpose. When it was constructed at the end of the 2nd century BCE, the Tower of the Winds included sundials, a clepsydra (water clock), and a weather vane, effectively making it the first meteorological station in the world. The octagonal structure was made almost entirely out of Pentelic marble, the same kind used for the Parthenon, which is rare to find in any structures other than temples. Built to measure time, it is also known as a horologion, meaning timepiece. Each of its eight sides faces a point on the compass, and features a frieze depicting each of the eight ancient Greek wind gods, giving the tower its name. They are: Boreas  (north),  Kaikias (northeast), Eurus (east), Apeliotes (southeast), Notus (south), Lips (southwest), Zephyrus (west), and Skiron (northwest). Beneath the friezes are eight vertical sundials where the shadow was cast on hour lines that, while faint, are still visible today. The building was originally topped with a bronze weather vane depicting the Greek Messenger of the Sea Triton, his hand pointing in the direction from which the wind was blowing. The interior of the structure contained a complicated internal clepsydra, or water clock, which was driven by water flowing down from a large well under the Acropolis. This was essential for use on cloudy days or at night when the sundials were ineffective. In early Christian times the structure was converted to a church, and the space outside to the northeast was used as a cemetery. During the Ottoman period, it was used as a place of worship by Sufi Muslim Whirling Dervishes. The Dervishes left after the Greek victory on the War of Independence, and afterward the building deteriorated until a restoration project between 1837 and 1845, when it was discovered that half the structure became covered with the earth and debris that had accumulated over the centuries, and half of it was underground.

80,The Temple of Dionysos,"Mikonos, Greece",Giant marble phalluses on the sacred island of antiquity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-temple-of-dionysos-mikonos-greece,"Delos, for the ancient Greeks, was a sacred island. The birthplace of the gods Apollo and Artemis, it was a place where all could gather in peace to worship the gods. According to Thucydides, so seriously was its holiness taken that no one was permitted to give birth – or even to die! – upon the island, for fear of offending the gods. At the heart of this sacred island lies the sanctuary of Dionysus, god of wine and transformation. And at the heart of this sanctuary sit several gigantic marble phalluses, each several meters high. While they have suffered somewhat from the ravages of time and tourists – and are all in various stages of disrepair – they still loom over the ancient site, surprising those visitors who thought that ancient Greece was either pure or simple.",erotic phallic islands statues ruins
81,Dikteon Cave,"Psichro, Greece","According to myth, Zeus himself was hidden in this cave to escape being eaten by his dad.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dikteon-cave,"In Greek myth, before there were gods, there were titans. The most notorious among them was Cronus, who was in the habit of eating his children immediately once they were born. That was until Rhea, Cronus’ long-suffering wife, hid one of the babies away, feeding her husband rocks instead. That hidden baby would grow up to become Zeus, king of the gods, and the cave he was hidden in is thought to be Greece’s Dikteon Cave. The birth of Zeus is one of several myths and legends associated with Dikteon Cave. Today this huge cave is only accessible via rented donkey or a reasonable hike from the back of the small village of Psyhro. For centuries the area had been held sacred by the cult of Zeus and few were allowed to enter. However in the late 19th century British and Italian archeologists finally unearthed some of the mysteries hidden in the dark of Dikteon Cave. The entrance to the cave is 1,025 meters above sea level adjacent to a fertile plateau that has been inhabited since 6,000 BCE. A place of worship, mystery and myth, Dikteon Cave, sometimes referred to as Psyhro Cave, is a true natural wonder as well as a historical one. The steep stairs descend roughly 100 meters into the mountainside. Despite the sweltering temperatures of summer in Crete, the inside of the cave can be 10 to 20 degrees centigrade cooler than the air outside. No light can reach the back thus it appears to be illuminated by an eerie green glow. Immense stalactites and stalagmites are present in massive quantities all along the stairwell. In the furthest depths of Dikteon are a small lake and a rock formation called “The Mantle of Zeus,” an imposing stalactite that hangs ominously from the ceiling over the lake. The hidden depths of Dikteon Cave seem to be as haunting and mysterious as they must have in ancient times. It truly feels like a place one might stumble upon a god baby.  This place is hard to get to. There are signs along the major freeways and road to help get in to the plateau but consult your map regularly.",ancient cults mythology caves ecosystems
82,First Cemetery of Athens,"Athens, Greece",The oldest cemetery of modern-day Athens blends the modern and ancient worlds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/first-cemetery-of-athens,"Though its name and regal white sculptures conjure thoughts of ancient Greece, the First Cemetery of Athens isn’t even 200 years old. It’s the city’s official cemetery and was only founded in 1837, not long after the modern Greek state was established. As such, it’s the oldest cemetery of modern-day Athens. Like much of the city, the graveyard provides a time-warping blend of modernity and the ancient world. It’s located right near the Panathinaiko Stadium and the Temple of Olympian Zeus, which were both built thousands of years ago. The cemetery pays homage to the city’s architectural history and boasts gorgeous examples of Neoclassical and Romantic features. Striking sculptures guard equally beautiful tombs. One of the most noteworthy is I Koimomeni (The Sleeping Girl), a sculpture of a dead young girl created by Yannoulis Chalepas, who also happens to be buried in the cemetery. It’s a rather prestigious place to be interred. The graves of important politicians, including a handful of prime ministers, can be found there. The bones of prominent Greek artists, actresses, poets, and musicians also now call the cemetery their eternal home. Heinrich Schliemann, the archaeologist who excavated the city said to be Troy, was buried beneath a particularly impressive tomb. Many claim that the cemetery is haunted by the ghostly presence of Nikolas Batsaris, a wreath bearer who worked in the cemetery until his death who is oblivious to human presence and can supposedly be seen sitting by a wreath.",graveyards graves gravestones burial places cemeteries sculptures
83,Mystras,"Sparta, Greece",The ruins of an abandoned medieval city where the last Byzantine emperor was crowned.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mystras-2,"The city of Mystras, the historic place where the last Byzantine emperor was crowned, now sits abandoned on the steep slopes of the Taygetus Mountains that tower over the Laconian plain. The ruins that remain transport visitors through a breathtaking, finely preserved medieval Byzantine city. The imposing fortress of Villehardouin crowns the highest point of the city and possesses the most fabulous views of the site. Its namesake, William II of Villehardouin, was Prince of Achaea, one of the anemic Latin crusader states established after France, Venice, and the Holy Roman Empire carved up the Byzantine Empire after the tragic Fourth Crusade of 1204. After the territory was reclaimed by the Byzantines in 1262, the site on which Villehardouin had built the fortress became the city of Mystras. Its strategic mountain location was increasingly more useful to the Byzantines, who were besieged on all sides by treacherous western adventurers and the seemingly unstoppable Ottoman Turks. Connected to the fortress through a descending series of narrow staircases and decaying arches are seven medieval churches in various states of preservation. The Peribleptos Monastery contains rare, colorful frescoes which depict Gospel scenes as well as a gruesome illustration of the damned in hell. The Pantanassa Monastery is the only still-occupied building in the city—here lives a small group of nuns, who tend to the garden and feed a bustling local colony of feral cats. Elsewhere on a steep rock face sits the magnificent Palace of the Despots, named for the peculiar title of the Byzantine royals who ruled the region in the 14th and 15th centuries. Located below the palace, the Metropolitan Church of St. Demetrius contains the colorful frescoes and a marble engraving of the crowned two-headed eagle of the coat of arms of the final emperors, the Palaiologos. In addition to its role in the political world of medieval Greece, Mystras was a center of a late-Byzantine cultural and artistic flowering that influenced the Renaissance. Its most famous resident was the philosopher Gemistus Pletho, an iconoclastic scholar who studied Aristotle, Zoroastrianism, and Jewish Kabbalah under the Turks in Edirne. Plethon advocated (to a horrified Orthodox clergy) for a Byzantine revival of the Greek pantheon ruled by Zeus, and his 15th-century voyage to Florence reintroduced the works of Plato to the West. Mystras fell to the Ottomans in 1460 and was inhabited until the 19th-century Greek War of Independence, after which it was abandoned. Travelers of that era ironically mistook its ruins for those of Sparta, another abandoned Peloponnesian city located just below Mystras on the Laconian plain. Because Mystras is located on a mountainside, a visit to the city involves moderately strenuous hiking. The site has two entrances: one at the base of the site and another at the top (near the fortress). If arriving by taxi from Sparta, it is highly advised to be driven to the upper entrance and walk down, rather than entering below and climbing up. Public buses travel to the site from Sparta daily.

84,Labyrinthos Caves,"Moires, Greece",Cretean quarry suggests real-life site for ancient Greek myth of the man-eating Minotaur in his labyrinth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/labyrinthos-caves,"Ancient Greek myth tells the tale of King Minos constructing an elaborate maze to contain the ghastly product of his wife’s adulterous bestiality: the flesh-eating, bull-man hybrid known as the Minotaur. Until very recently, this story was thought to have little basis in real events, though some archaeologists had claimed that the ruins of Knossos display a slight resemblance to the legendary labyrinth. However, a team of researchers has excavated an overlooked series of chambers and tunnels snaking beneath a quarry at Gortyn, a mere 20 miles distance from the former palace at Knossos, and pronounced it to be the primary candidate for the mythical labyrinth. For more than two-and-a-half miles the Labyrinthos Caves, as locals call them, take visitors on a disorienting trip through a series of intertwining passageways interspersed with widened rooms—on such is the eerily named “Altar Chamber”—and dead ends. While there is a limit to which the precise history of these caves will be discovered, explorers have tried for centuries to unravel its mysteries. The first foreign traveler to visit Gortyn was in 1415, who wrote of his experiences, “There is to the east a first corridor of two hundred steps. Another one with a northern direction seems to be endless. At least that’s what the locals claim. We observe many galleries, entangling one another and all of which seem to come back to the point where they begin…” This account suggests he fared better in the tunnels than the next visitor, Englishman Bernard Randolph, who in 1680 spent an hour in the passages and advanced no more than 100 meters, as measured by the ball of yarn he’d used to mark his trail. Randolph’s report merely stated that he saw lots of bats. Labyrinthos Caves have also been associated with their share of modern day gore, though of a different nature than that wrought by the Minotaur. Louis XVI sent spies to the caves for clandestine purposes, and the Nazis used them for an ammunition dump during the Second World War. Regardless of whether they were once the home and battlefield of a grotesque Grecian lovechild, the Labyrinthos Caves have already earned their spot on the short list of history buffs.  Precise location has not yet been disclosed to the public, though it is said to occupy a large area beneath the quarry at Gortyn, on the Greek isle of Crete. A smaller cave, known as Lavyrinthaki Cave, is accessible, though it's said to be infested with bats and wasps.",mazes cultures and civilizations subterranean sites caves ecosystems
85,Kastania Cave,"Kato Kastania, Greece",This remarkable cave was discovered after a shepherd watched bees enter and exit through a small fissure.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kastania-cave,"At the beginning of the last century, a shepherd named Kostas Stivaktas noticed something strange. While sitting in his fields in the village of Kato Kastania in southeastern Greece, he watched bees entering a crack in the rocks and come back out. Upon leaving, they seemed to be refreshed. Curious about this remarkable transformation, Stivaktas broke open the small fissure. Much to his amazement, he encountered a beautifully unique and rare cave, full of stalactites and stalagmites in unbelievable combinations of colors and shapes. Since then, both he and his descendants frequently used to go into the cave holding dried bush lit like a torch so they could see and get water from a small well inside. In 1958 the cave became better known and was assigned protection by the community of Kato Kastania. Today, the cave is open for tours through a number of its singular chambers. The cave, which is located at the foot of Mt. Parnonas, is rich in unique stone formations that are estimated to be some 3,000,000 years old. Rare formations such as disks and level stalagmites have formed along the walls and ceilings. In addition to the impressive rock formations, eagle-eyed visitors to the cave might catch a glimpse of the space’s resident rare creature, the “dolichopodo,” a locust-like insect that is both blind and deaf.  From December 23, 2019 until May 31, 2020 the cave is open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. There are tours every hour starting at 10:30 a.m., each lasts 30-40 minutes.

86,Theatre of Dionysus,"Athens, Greece","Heralded as the world's first theater, these ruins are often overlooked as they reside in the shadows of the Acropolis.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/theatre-of-dionysus,"This site is often overlooked by tourists to the region who opt to visit the more well-known Acropolis. However, the significance of this ancient site can’t be understated. Nestled along the slopes of the Acropolis in Athens are the ruins of the Theatre of Dionysus. The structure dates back to the 6th century BC and is believed to be the first theatre ever constructed. It was originally developed as a site for religious practices and festivals dedicated to Dionysus, the god of wine and plays. The theatre would eventually become the birthplace of the Greek tragedy. The seating around the theatre was originally composed of wood. During the Hellenistic period, marble thrones were added around the orchestra area for important figures and dignitaries. When Rome controlled the region during the year 61, numerous alterations were made to the theatre. A new stage was constructed that included marble flooring and more seating space was added. The theatre was then dedicated to Dionysus and emperor Nero. It’s thought that the massive theatre could seat up to 17,000 people. By the time of Byzantium, the theatre had been mostly destroyed (partly due to construction over the structure). The theatre remained hidden until it was rediscovered during the 1700s, however, the first formal archaeological excavation wasn’t conducted until 1838. What remains of the theatre is largely associated with its tiered seating, including some of the marble VIP seats. Today, the site looks insignificant when compared to the other theatre on the slopes of the Acropolis, the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, which is better preserved and a significantly later structure. Most people that visit the region only catch a glimpse of this once grand theatre from the top of Acropolis hill.

It does more than just look sharp. Dromeas, also called The Runner, is made of individual pieces of glass stacked atop each other to take the blurred shape of a runner in motion. Thousands of sharp, jagged pieces of glass form the sculpture. The running figure is the work of Costas Varotsos, who began working on it in 1988 and didn’t finish until 1994. It was originally erected at Omonia Square, but it was later moved because people grew concerned construction and the vibrations from the underground metro would cause it to shatter or topple. It’s a fitting sculpture within a city with so much running history—Athens was, after all, the final destination of Pheidippides’s famous run from the Battle of Marathon. But unfortunately, the artwork wasn’t met with unanimous appeal. Though some heralded the innovative sculpture, others were less-than-pleased with its unusual appearance.",glass sculptures art
88,Roman Tomb in Zara,"Athens, Greece",The ruins of an ancient Roman tomb hidden in the basement of a trendy clothing store.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/roman-tomb-zara,"There are three Zara stores (a trendy clothing chain) in the Athens city center, and archaeological ruins scattered throughout this ancient city. But there’s only one place where these two wildly disparate attractions intersect. In the basement of the Zara on Stadiou Street, the ruins of an ancient Roman tomb are on full display for all casual shoppers and savvy visitors to see. The tomb is separated from the retail area by a glass wall, so visitors can get just feet away from the ancient structure for up close and personal viewing. And just inside the front door, the floor consists of reinforced glass so you can look directly down into the lower level for a unique perspective of the ruins. The store is located in a 19th-century building with an unexpected history. It was originally the residence of the wealthy Greek philanthropist, Ioannis Hadjikyriakos. Completed in 1880, the beautiful neoclassical mansion was, at the time, one of the most impressive buildings in the city. In his will, Hadjikyriakos stated that upon his passing, the building should be converted to a hotel so all in the city and beyond could enjoy his masterpiece. When the renovation was complete the building opened as the Hôtel d’Egypte. The hotel failed to thrive so it was remodeled and named the Hôtel d’Athènes, where business was not much better. The building survived, but after the Germans invaded Greece in 1941, it was requisitioned first by the Greek Army and then by the occupying Germans. When the Germans retreated in 1944, it reverted to civilian use and served many purposes until it became vacant in the 1980s. When Greece was chosen to host the 2004 Olympic Games, many infrastructure projects began to prepare the city for the coming onslaught of visitors, including a modernization and extension of the Athens Metro System. While the Red Line was being renovated, ancient artifacts were discovered many places, including in front of the Hadjikyriakos building. Further excavation revealed there was an ancient Roman-era tomb that extended underneath the building’s foundation. Due to strict Greek laws protecting archaeological sites and artifacts, the renovation plans were modified to both protect the tombs and allow the public to admire them. The new plans called for the tombs to be on open display in the lower level of the building, which is how this ancient gem came to be housed in this most surprising locale inside a modern clothing store.  The tomb is on display when the Zara store is open to the public, currently daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Note that security is present and they are (rightfully) quite aggressive about protecting the tomb, as well as the privacy of visitors to the store.",shopping tombs roman shops ancient archaeology ruins

The original row of up to 12 (although there may have been as many as 16) stone lions was built around 600 BCE by the people of Naxos in honor of the god Apollo. The lions are faced East towards the Sacred Lake of Delos where Greek scholars of the time believed Apollo had been born. The lions seemed to have been placed in a position to either symbolically guard the site, or to simply inspire a sense of divine power to travelers on their way to Apollo’s shrine in the area. While visitors can still stroll by the original location of the five remaining lion statues, these are simply marble replicas. The actual feline figures have been moved to a nearby museum so that no more of the holy cats goes missing or gets destroyed by the elements.  Take the small ferry from Mikonos to Delos.

They have made attempts to sell them as scrap metal but still, since they were left there to rot in the 1980s, they are still standing there on the ten tracks in the suburb of Nea Ionia. Any new attempts to sell the cars have not been helped by the history of shady business dealings and scrap smuggling surrounding this and many other similar sites. Meanwhile the train cars remain stuck there, slowly rusting away exposed to weather and wind, overgrown by grass and trees.

91,Necromanteion of Ephyra,"Mesopotamos, Greece",Ancient Greek oracle of the dead.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/necromanteion-of-ephyra,"Although there were many oracles in ancient Greece, there is only one known oracle of the dead. It was an entryway to the underworld, and a place where the shades of the dead could - under special circumstances - reveal the future to the living. It was the place that Homer sent Odysseus to seek advice from a long-dead oracle, and where he was horrified by visions of Hades, and it also appears in a sordid chapter of Herodotus’ Histories. The site rests atop a hill near the confluence of the Acheron (“River of woe” in Greek), Pyriphlegethon (“Flaming with fire”) and Cocytus (“River of wailing”), three of the five rivers associated with Hades, was identified in 1958 by the Greek archaeologist Sotirios Dakaris. Dating to the 3rd or 4th century BC, the ruins are 72 feet square, with 11 foot thick walls, and subterranean chambers. The ancient Greeks believed that the souls of the dead entered the underworld though subterranean fissures, and that in special cases like this, arrangements could be made to communicate with the dead. This was used as an opportunity to commune with lost loved ones, and also to seek out the future telling skills of the dead. In the Odyssey, Odysseus descended into Hades to find the soul of Teiresias who might foretell his future, but once at the oracle, he saw much more than he had bargained for: “Thus solemn rites and holy vows we paid to all the phantom-nations of the dead; Then died the sheep: a purple torrent flow’d, And all the caverns smoked with streaming blood. When lo! appear’d along the dusky coasts, Thin, airy shoals of visionary ghosts: Fair, pensive youths, and soft enamour’d maids; And wither’d elders, pale and wrinkled shades; Ghastly with wounds the forms of warriors slain Stalk’d with majestic port, a martial train: These and a thousand more swarm’d o’er the ground, And all the dire assembly shriek’d around. Astonish’d at the sight, aghast I stood, And a cold fear ran shivering through my blood; Straight I command the sacrifice to haste, Straight the flay’d victims to the flames are cast, And mutter’d vows, and mystic song applied to grisly Pluto, and his gloomy bride.” - Odyssey book 11 The oracle is also mentioned in a charming passage from Herodotus wherein a brutal tyrant sends an emissary to the oracle of the dead at Ephyra to ask his dead wife about where she hid some money. The dead wife refuses to answer, on the grounds that she is cold in the underworld, because her husband had not burnt clothes for her at the time of her death. As a guarantee of her identity, she tells the messenger that her husband had sex with her corpse. Apparently this was enough confirmation for the living husband, who promptly set about stripping the clothing off of all of the local women and burning them, so that his dead wife would give up the location of the money. Visitors wishing to communicate with the dead would have entered the dark chamber and followed specific rituals outlined for the protection from and communication with the dead which would have taken several days. When ready, a priest would usher them deeper inside for a ritual animal sacrifice, and through three gates symbolic of Hades. Pilgrims expected to see the images of the dead as shadows against the flickering lantern light. These visions may have been enhanced by the special diet recommended in the days before entering the sanctuary, which some have described as including hallucinogens. Interestingly, inside the underground chambers, archaeologists have found mechanical contrivances which may have been used to enhance the appearance of animated dead. After a session with the dead, pilgrims were forbidden to talk about what they learned for fear of Hades claiming their own lives in exchange. Long after the destruction in 167 BC, an 18th century monastery dedicated to St. John the Baptist was built at the site. There has been some skepticism about the identification of these ruins as the Necromanteion. In 1979 German scholar Dietwulf Baatz recognized elements in the structure as mounts for third-century BC catapults implying a fortification of some sort. More recently a Greek-American study of towers in the area suggested that the ruins may have been the base of an agricultural tower, and the underground chambers storage areas for water or grain, rather than mystical communication with fortune-telling dead. At least for now, the place remains officially identified as the Necromanteion, and has been preserved as such.

92,Cape Matapan Caves,"Laconia, Greece",A cave network located at the southernmost tip of mainland Greece was once believed to be an entrance to Hades.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cape-matapan-caves,"Cape Matapan (also known as Cape Tainaron) is a small landmass at the end of the Mani Peninsula in Greece. This southern tip of the mainland separates the eastern Laconian Gulf from the Messenian Gulf in the west. However, the cape also provides the backdrop for a number of important myths and legends - and the ancient Greeks believed that a cave on the tip of the cape was an entrance to Hades, the underworld of Classical mythology. Here, according to the stories, is the place where Orpheus entered the underworld in search of his lost love, Euridice. When the hero Hercules passed down into the underworld, it was again through the Cape Matapan caves. In the second century AD, the celebrated Greek geographer Pausanias wrote of the site: “In the bend of the seaboard one comes, first, to a headland that projects into the sea, Taenarum, with its temple of Poseidon situated in a grove; and secondly, near by, to the cavern through which, according to the myth-writers, Cerberus was brought up from Hades by Herakles.” These are not the only legends ascribed to the remote peninsula, however. The Spartans viewed this as a highly significant place of worship, and they built several temples to their gods along the rocky headland. Most prominent amongst the surviving ruins, are the remains of a temple dedicated to the sea god Poseidon – located on a hill directly above the cave to Hades. The Temple of Poseidon features in a notable folk story regarding the poet Arion. Kidnapped by pirates during a voyage from Italy to Greece, Arion – who had previously invented the ‘dithyramb,’ a song and dance in praise of Dionysus – threw himself from the pirate ship in an attempt to escape. He sang to Apollo, the god of poetry, and his call was answered by a pod of dolphins. They carried him to safety, to arrive at the shores of Cape Matapan and the sanctuary of Poseidon. When the Byzantines arrived this temple was converted to the Christian faith, and to this day the site is still used in religious services. Nearby visitors will find a bronze likeness of the poet Arion riding a dolphin. The caves at Cape Matapan feature an intricate tapestry of stalactites and stalagmites, and while they are partially beneath the water level it is possible to visit the caverns by boat.",subterranean sites caves ecosystems

This is in part because there is so much superstition surrounding the mountainside of Pendeli that even modern people are hesitant to explore it. Pendeli Mountain is historically important because it’s where the marble for the Parthenon was quarried. The stone was then moved down to the city with an intricate network of carts and pulleys, and you can still see the tracks today! But the most fascinating thing about the mountain is certainly Davelis Cave, named for the nineteenth-century brigand named Davelis. His band used this cave as a hideout, and legend has it that there was a maze of tunnels there which could take him all the way to the mansion of his lover—reputedly a French Duchess living in the village of Pendeli. (Unfortunately, this legend is not true.) Inside the cave is a rare double Byzantine church built directly into the rock. One half is dedicated to St. Spyridon and the other to St. Nicolas. It was used by twelfth-century Christian hermits associated with the Gnostics. A bit deeper into the cave, an even older god was worshiped—Pan. Many artifacts excavated from the Pendeli cave depict Pan and his nymphs. These objects can now be seen in the Archaeological Museum of Athens. Another rather peculiar finding from the cave was a naturally mummified body of a woman that now is kept at the Museum of Criminology in Athens. The cave has been plagued with rumors and strange sightings, including electronics going haywire, water rolling up instead of down, and sightings of cat-like creatures walking on two legs. On the left wall, you can see the etchings of past travelers, including several nineteenth- and early twentieth-century English writers. Should you visit the cave, you will need to arrange transportation, as there is no public means of getting past neo-Penteli village. But please be respectful: The cave has no guards or gates, so it is unprotected as of now.

94,The Olive Tree of the Acropolis,"Athens, Greece",Legend says this sacred tree was a gift from goddess Athena.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/olive-tree-acropolis,"Thousands of years ago, the gods Poseidon and Athena battled for the favor of Athens. According to legend, Poseidon smashed his trident upon the land to create a salt spring, while the wise Athena offered a more productive gift: She planted an olive tree atop the Acropolis. The city’s denizens chose Athena, and you can still find an olive tree in the same spot today. Regardless of how the olive tree originated, one has grown there since ancient times, when the state considered it the chief moria, or a tree protected by the state for its religious significance. The tree suffered during wars over the centuries, but it has always survived, or a branch was always saved to be replanted. When the Persians invaded and burned Athens in 480 B.C., a branch is believed to have sprouted from the tree that same day, and seeds were replanted across Attika. During World War II, occupying German forces badly damaged the tree, but staff from the American School of Archaeology rescued a branch, and the present tree was planted from that cutting, in 1952, by Queen Sophia of Spain (then Princess Sophia of Greece) at its original location. Today, the olive tree stands on the north side of the Acropolis, in front of the ancient temple of Erechtheion.  The Acropolis has set opening hours and requires tickets.

According to legend, Hephaestus landed here after Zeus hurled him off Mount Olympus - and although the fall was a steep one, he could hardly have touched down in a more appropriate spot. The Miocene volcanoes that used to spew lava on these shores are long gone, but they’ve left behind peculiar, entrancing rock formations. The locals call these rocks “faraklo” or “fragokefala” - “bald” or “bald heads” - references to the barren hills and tawny orbs that dot the volcanic landscape. This petrified lava is frozen in all sorts of bizarre shapes, from ripples in the rockface to built-up 3D spirals. Markedly unlike the extensive beaches and striking waterfalls that draw most tourists to the island, this site is located at the northern edge of the island, beyond the settlement of Poliochni (which is notable in itself, as the oldest Neolithic city in Europe).

96,Agia Dynami,"Athens, Greece",This small 16th-century church in Athens is almost entirely surrounded by a modern building.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agia-dynami-church-holy-power,"This tiny Byzantine-era Greek orthodox church honors the Virgin Mary and serves as a shrine for pregnant women to go and pray for a safe delivery. Among all the Byzantine churches still standing in Athens, this quaint little sanctuary has the curious distinction of being the only one surrounded on all sides by a modern building. The Agia Dynami (Holy Power) church was built in the 16th-century. Following the victory in the Greek War of Independence in the 1830s, the buildings around the church were demolished so the street could be widened to serve the growing needs of the city. In the 1950s, the area was again redeveloped and the Greek government attempted to obtain the land the church sat on to build the new headquarters for the Ministry of Education and Religion. The Greek Orthodox Church refused to surrender the property, so it was decided to build over it, and the small single-aisle church found itself almost entirely ensconced in a modern municipal building, wedged between the supporting pillars of the new construction. (The building was converted to the Electra Metropolis Hotel in 2016.) Inscriptions found on the grounds suggest the little church was built on the site of an ancient temple dedicated to Heracles, the Greek demigod famous for his strength and for performing “the 12 labors” upon request of the king of Tiryns. A 50-foot tunnel was discovered under the church connecting it to a large cave system that some say reaches to the Acropolis and the Kaisariani Monastery on the north side of Mount Hymettus. In 1963, a steeple was built over the entrance to the tunnel prohibiting future access. During the War of Independence, Greek munitions experts were forced to make bullets for the Turks in the church. However, they were successful in also making large numbers of them for the Greek revolutionaries, smuggling them out through the garbage nightly.  The church was renovated in 1912 and again in the 1950s. It is usually open daily, with many Athenians popping in on their way to and from work to say a quick prayer or light a candle. The church's main celebration takes place annually on September 9, the date of the birth of Virgin Mary. Dress codes vary from church to church in Greek Orthodoxy. If you wish to enter the church, a show of respect to the church and its members is achieved by modest clothing and proper behavior. For men, shorts, tank tops/sleeveless shirts and sandals/flip flops are frowned upon. Women's shoulders should not be shown in church so anything strapless or with thin straps should be avoided. Skirts and dresses should at a minimum come below the knee. Some churches ask that no leg be shown.",ancient churches sacred spaces architectural oddities history architecture
97,Pythagoras Cave,"Samos Prefecture, Greece","Cave on extinct volcano, once home to famous mathematician Pythagoras.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pythagoras-cave,"On the Greek island of Samos is a cave system that was once home and classroom to famous mathematician and philosopher, Pythagoras. The cave is located on Mount Kerkis, an extinct volcano that forms the second-highest peak in the East Aegean. Though Pythagoras’ theorems have been fundamental to our understanding of mathematics, relatively little is known about the man who first proved that, in a right triangle, a2 + b2 = c2. According to local legend, however, Pythagoras fled to these caves when he was being hunted by the infamous tyrant, Polycrates, around 400 B.C. During this time, it is believed that Pythagoras inhabited one small cave and used a nearby larger cave as his classroom. One can only imagine the types of lessons Pythagoras taught while living on Mount Kerkis. After all, in addition to being a mathematician, Pythagoras was also the founder of the esoteric religious movement known as Pythagoreanism. Rooted in both mathematics as well as mysticism, Pythagoreanism has been described as “a philosophical school, a religious brotherhood, and a political association.” Though it is known that the Pythagoreans followed many of the religious and ascetic beliefs of their master, much of their practices have been shrouded in secrecy. Today, most of the caves on Mount Kerkis are open to the public. Visitors can explore the old home of Pythagoras, nearby chapels, as well as a series of stalactites which “holy water” allegedly drips from.

98,Chios Rocket War,"Vrontados, Greece",Two churches shoot bottle rockets at each others' bell towers in an unusual Easter celebration.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chios-rocket-war-rouketopolemos,"Two rival parishes on the Greek island of Chios engage in a most unusual and dangerous Easter tradition that has been taking place quite possibly since the Ottoman era. The churches, which sit on opposite hillsides about 400 meters away from one another, recreate a yearly “Rocket War,” which is exactly what it sounds like. Until 1889, real cannons were used in this annual performance, which no one really seems to know the origin of. After their cannons were outlawed and confiscated, the two churches in question, Angios Marcos and Panaghia Ereithiani, had to resort to homemade bottle rockets. These fiery weapons are produced throughout the year for the blazing spectacle that draws a high number of tourists. Tourism may just be the only reason the tradition has survived this long. Most residents are understandably not big fans of up to 80,000 unstable fire sticks screaming through the sky and slamming into the bell towers of their churches while they attempt to attend mass inside. As the rocket builders blow off digits and sometimes lose their lives preparing for the battle, the less-enthusiastic board up buildings and try to protect as much as possible with wire mesh. By the next morning, ears are ringing, throats are filled with smoke and sulphur, fires have been put out, and burns have been treated, but a winner is never officially decided on. The sign of victory is the most direct hits afflicted on the rival, but every year both congregations declare themselves the winners, and they agree to disagree and settle the score next year.",day of rivals rivals week wondrous performances cultures and civilizations festivals rites and rituals churches sacred spaces
99,Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art,"Athens, Greece",Large collection from the 3rd millennium BCE.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goulandris-museum-of-cycladic-art,"Dedicated to the study and promotion of ancient cultures of the Aegean and Cyprus, with special emphasis on Cycladic Art of the 3rd millennium BCE, the Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art was founded in 1986 thanks to a heavy collection built up by Nicholas and Dolly Goulandris. While the collection was impressive to begin with - enough to justify an entire museum, in fact - it has grown in size with both direct purchases and donations over the past couple of decades. The Goulandris couple began collecting archeological artifacts in the 1960s after they were granted permission by the Greek state. Quickly recognized by scholars of the region, the Goulandris collection focused on marble figurines and vessels. First presented to the Benaki Museum in 1978, the Goulandris collection was asking for a museum all its own only a decade and a half or so after it first started to accumulate. For four or five years after visiting the Benaki, the collection traveled to major galleries and museums all over the world, including the National Gallery of Washington in 1979, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts in 1981, the Musees Royaux d’Art er d’Historie and the Palais des Beaux Arts at Brussels in 1982, and the British Museum at London in 1983. After the collection was done traveling, the Museum of Cycladic Art was inaugurated in January of 1986. Nicholas had died in 1983 when the collection was being moved from museum to museum and, unable to coordinate all of the logistic by herself, Dolly Goulandris donated the entire collection to the museum. Only a few months earlier, a Goulandris Foundation was organized to focus on “the study of Aegean civilization, research on prehistoric, Classical and modern Greek art, as well as its dissemination and promotion,” according to the museum’s official website. Now known as one of the great museums of Athens, the Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art holds more than 200 objects. A museum shop on site holds books on ancient art and reproductions of items from the collection.",natural history ancient collections museums and collections art museums
100,Mount Athos,"Agion Oros, Greece",An autonomous republic of Orthodox monks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/holy-mount-athos,"Holy Mountain of Athos is a place out of time, a slice of history that might have never existed. Here, even the calendar is different from one used by the rest of the Greece. For most of its existence, this tiny peninsula was an island of tranquility in the turbulent sea of everyday life. It is a spiritual sanctuary and one of the holiest places within Orthodox Christianity. The Holy mountain of Athos is a monk republic, autonomous within the borders of Greece and administered directly by the Universal patriarch of Constantinople. The oldest monastic settlements on Mount Athos date back to early 900s. However, the region itself rose to prominence during the last years of Byzantine empire and the beginning of Ottoman rule, when the conquering Ottoman armies and bands of freelance marauders ravaged the Balkan peninsula. Christian monks seeking refuge found shelter in the steep cliffs and dense forests of Mount Athos. The community grew quickly, becoming in the process one of most important centers of Orthodoxy in Europe. It served as a beacon for seekers of spiritual enlightenment from as far a way as Russia and Georgia. While over the years the monk population was slowly declining, the population underwent a recent upswing after the fall of communism, with an influx of new arrivals from Eastern Europe. Today there are 20 monasteries scattered over a 37-mile-long peninsula, and the current population is around 2,200. Some of the monasteries belong to distinct national churches: Hilandar to Serbian, Zograf to Bulgarian and Ivrion Georgian. Some of the monks have opted to live in even greater isolation, living in sketes, small communities which consist of a common prayer area, a chapel or a church and a number of individual huts. There are currently 12 sketes on Mount Athos. The town of Karyes serves locally as an administrative center of the region. It is also a home to about 2,000 additional lay workers hired by the monasteries. Mount Athos is a closed community. Visits by tourists are tightly controlled, as not to disturb the peace and piety of the residents. There is an age old ban on visitation by women, which according to the monks, is a prohibition imposed not out of feeling of male superiority, but one born out of weakness of human spirit. Although technically part of Greece and the European Union, Mount Athos is said to be exempt from most of the EU treaties. Unfortunately, even though we live in the 21st century, only men are allowed to visit the Mount Athos, as the over 1000-year old ""Abaton"" for women holds until today. For men, entry to the mountain is usually by ferry boat either from the port of Ouranoupoli (for west coast monasteries) or from Ierrisos for those on the east coast. Before embarking on the boat all visitors must have been issued a diamonitirion, a form of Byzantine visa that is written in Greek, dated using the Julian calendar, and signed by four of the secretaries of leading monasteries. There are generally two kinds of diamonitirion: the general diamonitirion that enables the visitor to stay overnight at any one of the monasteries but only to stay in the mountain for three days, and the special diamonitirion which allows a visitor to visit only one monastery or skete but to stay as many days as he has agreed with the monks. The general diamonitirion is available upon application to the Pilgrims' Bureau in Thessaloniki. Once this has been granted it will be issued at the port of departure, on the day of departure. Once granted, the pilgrim can contact the monastery where they would like to stay in order to reserve a bed (one night only per monastery). The ferries require reservations, both ways.Most visitors arrive at the small port of Dafni from where they can take the only paved road in the mountain to the capital Karyes or continue via another smaller boat to other monasteries down the coast. There is a public bus between Dafni and Karyes. Expensive taxis operated by monks are available for hire at Dafni and Karyes. They are all-wheel drive vehicles since most roads in the mountain are unpaved. Visitors to monasteries on the mountain's western side prefer to stay on the ferry and disembark at the monastery they wish to visit.",micro-nations monks mountains religion sacred spaces

Their name—which translates to “Dragon Lake”— and the legends attached to them enhance the sense of magic and mystery. Drakolimni is the name of a handful of lakes in Greece’s Epirus region. One lake is on Mount Tymfi and the other is on Mount Smolikas, two mountains that are only a few miles apart. According to local lore, two enemy dragons once lived within these mountains. When the beasts fought, they chucked rocks and pines at one another, denting the Earth and creating the enchanting environment that exists today. Sadly, you won’t find any mythical dragons lurking within the lakes. Instead, you’ll find alpine newts happily roaming within the gorgeous landscape. Because the amphibians look a bit like tiny dragons—locals even refer to them as “little dragons”—it’s likely they inspired the lakes’ fantastical name.

102,The Ruins of Rentina,"Thessaloniki, Greece",These ruins in Volvi were once at the intersection of the Eastern and Western Worlds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ruins-of-rentina-thessaloniki-greece,"This abandoned hilltop settlement near the ancient city of Arethousa was a stronghold for a succession of ancient civilizations. For decades, archaeologists have tried to untangle the complex history of the ruins at Rentina. It appears that humans settled this beautiful hilltop in Greece during the Neolithic period. The hill was an ideal place for fortifications to protect nearby settlements in the fertile Rihios River Valley below. Some of the remaining walls on the hill date from the Hellenistic period (323-321 BC) when the fortifications would have been in Greek hands. During the time of the Byzantine emperor Justinian (527-565 AD), the hilltop was further built up, and an impressive church was built there in the 10th century. Over time, the hilltop would feature a castle, chapel, fort, homes and businesses. In 1204, the waning empire surrendered Rentina to the Frankish Kingdom of Thessalonica, but it was retaken by John III Doukas Vatatzes, emperor of the Byzantine Empire, in 1242. Over the next two centuries, Rentina would fall to the Serbs (1345), the Greeks (1371), the Turks (1383), the Greeks again (1402), and finally the Ottomans (before 1423). With the final conquest by the Turks it seems Rentina went into irreversible decline, as citizens and government officials unsurprisingly decamped for safer settlements. Today, the breathtaking ruins of Rentina are situated near a busy highway and not open to the general public. However, they afford select visitors a visual reminder of Europe’s ever-complicated multi-national past. A 20 minute walk from Agia Marina Church",forts castles churches sacred spaces ruins

The vessel’s appearance on the Greek beach is almost as strange as the rumors that surround its history. Built in Denmark in 1950 as Klintholm, the 220-foot (67-meter) freight ship was later acquired by a Greek company, which changed its name to Dimitrios. The ship was moored in Gythio in 1980 and remained abandoned at the dock for about a year. In 1981, the ship—which had been declared unsafe to use—broke free during rough weather. The uncrewed ghost ship sailed aimlessly throughout the Laconian Gulf for over a month until it finally became stranded on the shore where it rests today. The abandoned ship is made even more alluring by the rumors that surround it. Some claim the vessel ferried goods as part of an illegal tobacco trade between Italy and Turkey and was later burned to hide the evidence.

104,Olive Tree of Vouves,"Ano Vouves, Greece","The oldest olive tree in Greece has been bearing fruit for at least 2,000 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/olive-tree-of-vouves,"It’s impossible to date this tree’s exact age without felling it, but dendrologists estimate this olive tree is at least 2,000 years old. It might even be the oldest in the world, though it’s in competition with the Stara Maslina in Montenegro. Another indication of the Vouves tree’s age is the fact that two cemeteries from the Geometric Period (900 BC - 700 BC) were discovered nearby. Despite its ancient age, the tree continues to produce olives, Vouves’ heritage product. A museum was built right next to it to celebrate the tradition of olives in Greece and the rest of the Mediterranean. There’s evidence of olive cultivation in Greece as far back as the Neolithic period. There are references to olive oil in the writings of Herodotus and Pliny the Elder as well as the Hebrew record of the Exodus from Egypt. According to ancient Greek historians, the city of Athens was named as such as an offering to the goddess Athena, in the hopes that she would continue to bless them with a bountiful olive harvest. This history, coupled with the fact that practically every Greek dish uses olive oil as a base, indicates how inextricable olives are from Greek identity. The 15-foot-wide tree was here when both Christ and Muhammad walked the Earth, when the Bubonic Plague devastated Europe, when Beethoven composed the 5th, and everything in between. It is arguably the most important tree in Greece, and it’s got the connections to prove it: laurels for the 2008 Beijing Olympics were crafted with branches from the Vouves tree.",greece trees plants food
105,Old Madrasa of Athens,"Athens, Greece",The ruined doorway is a portal to the building's turbulent and torturous past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/doorway-of-the-madrasa,"Many ruins in Athens are glamorous and romantic, but this site is a visible reminder of dark times. The doorway is all that remains of the Ottoman era Islamic Madrasa (Theological School) of Athens, Greece. In the center of the courtyard was a large plane tree that became a gathering place for leaders of the Muslim community. Over time, this tree became the symbol of the Madrasa. Like most Ottoman Madrasas, the school was a rectangular building with living quarters surrounding a large courtyard. The structure, which was built in 1721, functioned as a Madrasa until the later years of the Ottoman period, when the Madrasa was moved to another location and the site was converted to a prison. During its years as a prison, the living quarters became overcrowded, inhumane prison cells, and the plane tree became a hangman’s tree for hundreds of executions. Those not executed were subjected to torture and slavery. The Madrasa was nearly destroyed during the early part of the Greek War of Independence. After the liberation of Athens, the Madrasa was rebuilt and used as barracks by the Greek Army for the remainder of the war. After the Greeks’ victory, it was converted yet again, this time into a prison for both Turks and Greek political prisoners. The new Greek government revived the hangings on the plane tree for “deserving” Turks and traitorous Greeks. The prison was finally closed right before the 20th century, and the Archaeology Department began demolition in search of older and more important artifacts. By 1915, all that remained was the main door and a small portion of the adjacent exterior walls, most of which can be seen today. The tree was destroyed by a lightning strike in 1919, appropriately closing a chapter on the horrific things that took place on and around it. While the tree may be gone, history buffs can still gaze upon the doorway that led students, prisoners, and the condemned to the plane tree and their fate.  It's located in Plaka, the oldest neighborhood of this ancient city. The Madrasa was built just outside the Roman Agora opposite the Tower of the Winds.",islam schools ruins

Mastic production remains a proud tradition and critical for the local economy, but it is Pyrgi’s xista, the sgraffito designs painted all around town on buildings’ facades, that draw a steady trickle of tourists.

But though this particular city was born after a crucial moment in Roman history, it remains unusually overlooked. The city’s name means “City of Victory,” and it’s a celebration of a battle that changed the course of Roman history. Nicopolis (also spelled Nikopolis) was founded by Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus—later known as Augustus, the first emperor of Rome—to honor his victory in the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. In this battle, his troops defeated the forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, basically putting an end to the Final War of the Roman Republic. After it was founded in 29 BC, the city thrived. Because of its location near the Ionian Sea, Nicopolis soon became a hub for trade, commerce, and transportation within the Mediterranean. Augustus filled the city with exquisite monuments and grand architecture, including a shrine to Apollo, his patron god. Nicopolis managed to survive throughout the centuries, despite years of power changes, wars, and attempted invasions. But by the 13th century, the city was completely abandoned. The Byzantine powers had relocated the province capital to Nafpaktos, sending Nicopolis into a rapid decline it never managed to bounce back from. Though its people long since abandoned the place, remnants of the city’s legacy still stand.

113,The Oldest Chunk of Rock in the World,Greenland,The 3.8 billion-year-old rock proves that tectonic plates may have been shifting longer than we thought.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oldest-chunk-of-rock-in-the-world-isua-supracrustal-belt,"In 2007, scientists discovered some of the oldest segments of the earth’s crust on an island off the coast of Greenland. The rocks they discovered are at least 3.8 billion years old. Although very old, scientists had previously found older rocks still–the oldest, in fact. They are 4.28 billion years old, making them 250 million years more ancient than any previously discovered rocks. Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a disk of gas and dust circling the sun. Remnants of crust from Earth’s infancy are hard to come by because most of that material has been recycled into Earth’s interior several times by the plate tectonics that continues to shape our planet’s surface. As if the crust’s age weren’t enough to make this find it significant, there’s more. The find is an ophiolite, a rock created when one tectonic plate is forced underneath the other. Essentially, one bit of an oceanic or continental plate is shaved off onto the other, forming a layered rock. Ophiolites are important signs of plate tectonics and the 3.8 billion-year-old rock signals that plate tectonics may have been moving around the Earth’s surface for more than a billion years longer than scientists originally hypothesized. This chunk of rock was found in what scientists call an island arc environment, consisting of a row of volcanoes near the spots where tectonic plates are converging. These arcs are formed when water released from a subducted plate melts the rocks above and causes magma to punch through the crust above. For the record, this ophiolite is merely the largest chunk of such rock ever discovered. Small, 4.4 billion-year-old chunks of zircon have been found within other rocks before now.",geological oddities natural wonders geology nature

Greenland was an ideal site because of its proximity to Russia, but this also made the construction that much more risky. It was kept a secret from Denmark, of which Greenland is a constituent. But you can’t just go digging thousands of miles in in the ice and expect no one to notice. So, as a cover, the U.S. Army claimed to be building “Camp Century,” a “research facility” sanctioned by Denmark. Built in 1960 near Thule Air Base, its stated purpose was to study construction techniques and established scientific experiments under Arctic conditions. In actuality it was all a cover; the underground research facility gave the U.S. an excuse to dig under the ground to plant the missiles. Though Camp Century was a diversion, it wasn’t totally hollow. Coring deep into the ice allowed scientists to study thousands of years of climate history. They were also able to look back in time by observing germs preserved in water that melted off glaciers. People lived and worked there year-round—the underground camp included a chapel, a theater, and a hobby shop, all contained in interconnected tunnels sort of like an ant colony. All the electricity was supplied by the world’s first mobile nuclear reactor, which was assembled elsewhere then placed in the deep recesses of the snow. Though Camp Century utilized some traditional building materials like wood and steel, most of the tunnels were simply dug into the ice (hence the name “Iceworm”). It was predicted to have lasted ten years without substantial upkeep, but the glaciers were moving faster than expected, which would ultimately render the camp unusable. It was evacuated, used infrequently for a few years, then totally abandoned in 1967. When Camp Century was deserted, it was left almost entirely intact. The U.S. military assumed consistent snowfall and crushing glaciers would encase the research facility for all time. However, in 2016, an investigation revealed that because global warming has caused the ice sheet covering Camp Century to melt, the facility may be unearthed by the end of the century, maybe sooner. If and when that happens, any waste—radioactive or otherwise—that’s uncovered along with the base could wind up disrupting the surrounding ecosystems—a wholly unintended consequence of a top-secret Cold War plot.",physics bunkers secret cold war nuclear hidden science abandoned military

117,Qilakitsoq Mummies,"Nuuk, Greenland",These eight mummies are the best-preserved human remains ever discovered in North America.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qilakitsoq-mummies,"When two brothers went out hunting for grouse one morning in 1972, they had no idea they’d end the day uncovering what would become one of Greenland’s most treasured artifacts. But that’s exactly what happened. As the pair combed the landscape for game, they came across the abandoned Inuit settlement of Qilakitsoq, and soon uncovered eight frozen mummies that had been buried under a large pile of stones. The corpses they found were not intended to be mummified at the time of their burial, but thanks to Greenland’s ice-cold climate, the natural elements had kept the bodies in an exceptionally well-preserved state. Alerting the authorities to their discovery, researchers and archaeologists journeyed to the site, knowing the newly discovered mummies were an unrivaled opportunity to learn more about the life, customs, and traditions of Greenland’s native Inuit population. Using x-ray and other methods to ensure the site remained as intact as possible, scientists were able to date the mummies—which totaled six women, a young boy, and an extremely young baby—to somewhere around 1475. Along with the mummies, most of which were heavily tattooed on their foreheads, eyebrows, and chins, researchers uncovered 78 pieces of clothing that were made from reindeer, seal, and other skins. But the most interesting, or perhaps shocking, discovery was that the small infant mummy appeared to have been buried alive. Inuit tradition at the time dictated that if a mother passed away, her smaller children must be buried with her, even if they were completely healthy. The reasoning for such a ghastly act is sad but seems practical for the time, with local cultural norms dictating that absent their mother, children had no one to care for them and must travel together with their maternal guardian to safely reach the land of the dead.  Four of the Qilakitsoq mummies are on permanent display at the Greenland National Museum in Nuuk. Admission is free but check the museum's website for operating days/hours as they vary based on the season.",discovery mummies indigenous archaeology museums
118,Summit Camp,Greenland,This remote research station sits amid the second-largest ice sheet on the planet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/summit-camp,"Situated at the highest point of the Greenland ice sheet, the second-largest body of ice on Earth, Summit Camp is one of the most remote research stations in the world. It sits amid an enormous ice cap that covers about 80 percent of the surface of Greenland—a giant frozen mass that would cause sea levels to rise some 24 feet if it were all to melt. The station at its apex is also one of the most challenging to access, inhabited by just a handful of people in the wintertime. The nearest town, Ittoqqortoormiit, is 285 miles (460 km) away. The summit is at an altitude of over 10,000 feet (3,200 meters) and usually experiences temperatures between -58˚F to 14˚F (-50°C to -10°C). It’s open year-round, used by scientists to monitor various aspects of this extreme Arctic climate, such as air-snow interactions, and measure greenhouse gas, among other research. The two main permanent structures at the camp are called the Big House and the Green House. The former serves as the main building, with offices, the kitchen, a full bathroom, and laundry facilities. The Green House contains a science laboratory, an emergency kitchen, communications, and other amenities, and it is connected to the main living quarters. A generator supplies the station with electric energy, and the heat produced is also used to power a snow melter that provides water to this far-flung facility. Permits from the Danish Polar Center and the Home Rule of Greenland are required to visit the station. Access is provided via the Kangerlussuaq Airport, but during winter visits are infrequent. The exact coordinates of the station vary because of the constantly shifting ice.",research arctic circle snow glaciers ice environment science
119,Arboretum Groenlandicum,"Narsarsuaq, Greenland",An experimental forest at the foreground of arboreal science is also the canary in the coal mine for climate change.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arboretum-groenlandicum,"In the middle of the 20th century, the icy island nation of Greenland in the North Atlantic faced a bit of an arboreal conundrum, and pillaging its neighbors’ trees seemed to be the only answer. Established just outside Narsarsuaq in 1954 when arborists became aware that it wasn’t Greenland’s soil that had prevented forestation from taking place, Arboretum Groenlandicum began as a place for species of trees native to the country to be given a fresh shot a life in a new locale. But once they got started, scientists figured why stop there? The experiment at Narsarsuaq became a sort of scientific articulation of the theory “if you build it, they will come,” testing the limits of cultivating an effective, natural, yet wholly fabricated forest environment. What resulted was a small forest that’s about as technicolor (for an arctic pine forest) as any on the planet. Over the following decades, saplings and seeds of boreal trees and shrubs were borrowed from all over the northern hemisphere. And by the dawn of the new millennia, the greenery at Arboretum Groenlandicum was thriving. Within its nearly 500 acres lived nearly all the subarctic and northern subalpine tree-line species found in the Northern Hemisphere, including species like lodgepole pine commonly associated with the American Rocky Mountains, Siberian larch, Norwegian spruces, Scots pine, Himalaya birch, a diverse assortment of broadleaved trees, and many more. More somberly, the forest at Arboretum Groenlandicum has become experimental on an additional, unexpected front; due to its location in an environment at the forefront of global warming, the exceptionally diverse stand of trees is now also being studied to monitor the consequences of global warming in the individual specimens themselves, before the waves of change reach their nations of origin. The far southern fjords of Greenland do actually contain some stunted forests composed of various willow species, Downy Birch, Green Alder, Greenland Mountain Ash, Labrador Tea, and Creeping Juniper. There is evidence based on pollen records that these stunted forests extended in patches as far north as Nuuk as recently as 1000 years ago. The climate is also a transitional one between a milder-winter subarctic climate and a colder-winter sub-polar oceanic climate, with summer highs in the 60’s, it is roughly hardiness zone 4b or 5a and could be compared to Alaska’s Seward Peninsula and/or Iceland’s northeastern plateau.",arctic circle botanical gardens forests gardens trees ecosystems plants
120,Qaqortoq Road,"Qaqortoq, Greenland","In a country where driving from one town to another is literally impossible, this small stretch of gravel is a remarkable feat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qaqortoq-road,"With only some 55,000 people spread out over more than 800,000 square miles, Greenland takes home the prize for the least densely populated country in the world. While this means Greenlanders have plenty of space to roam, it makes the actual logistics of getting from one point to another much more complicated than your average developed nation. In fact, the country’s vastness coupled with its naturally icy and rocky terrain means that while there are roads within communities, none of Greenland’s towns or cities are connected to one another over land. Constructing even a basic road between two Greenlandic population centers is prohibitively expensive and equally impractical. As a result, Greenlanders must take to the skies, or hop on a boat when the weather allows, to travel any meaningfully long distance within the country. That’s why at just 3.8 miles (6.2 kilometers) long, a newly built road in Qaqortoq, in the country’s far south, holds the impressive title of  the country’s longest single road built since World War II. To be honest, there isn’t much competition. As of now, though, the longest road in Greenland is also a road to nowhere. Constructed in 2015 to link the town to a new nearby airport that will boast a nearly 5,000 foot (1,500 meters) long runway, the road was completed but the airport has yet to materialize. Until that happens, Qaqortoq’s 3,000 residents will have to stick to the town’s helipad for their travel needs.",travel urban planning roads infrastructure transportation
121,Infrasound Station IS18,"Thule, Greenland",Neither bomb blasts nor heartbeats escape the giant ears of this super sci-fi Arctic outpost.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/infrasound-station-is18,"The terrain at Qaanaaq is treacherous and harsh; there’s no way in but by helicopter. Once there, one is met with unpaved roads that demand a four-wheel drive vehicle on a good day. Locals keep to the traditional way of life, subsisting on fresh-caught seal, polar bear, and narwhal… yet this desolate outpost in remotest Greenland is home to one of the world’s most high-tech listening devices, tasked with saving humanity from itself. Located along the coastline just outside the village of Qaanaaq – which bears the additional distinction of being the world’s most northerly palindrome – the sole purpose of Infrasound station IS18 consists of listening to the planet’s groans that occur at frequencies too low for the human ear to detect, occurring within the range of 20 Hz down to 0.001 Hz. Qaaanaaq’s eight-element array is divided into two sub-arrays bolstered by wind reduction technology, all of which are linked to a Central Processing Facility (or CPF) that churns out data around-the-clock to a central terminal in Qaanaaq proper. But why put such an extremely space-age device in a village accessible only by helicopter, whose locals subsist largely on narwhal, seals, and polar bears? In its most practical application, IS18 is part of a network of highly specialized sensors charged with monitoring the globe for atomic blasts, as set forth by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). Around the clock, the array monitors the entire world for distinctive blast patterns produced by such explosions, as their unique pattern of ultra-low frequency sound waves persist even when ricocheting through the Earth’s surface. More broadly, the range of sounds IS18 can detect doesn’t only include mankind’s attempts to annihilate itself. Infrasound is used to trace earthquakes, locate petroleum deposits based on their movements, and monitor the human heart in ballistocardiography. When viewed in this light, it seems like Greenland’s observatory at the end of the world is keeping tabs on the pulse of us all, perhaps on an even more enormously important scale than we thought.",atom bombs explosions sounds instruments of science science
122,Stone & Man,"Qaqortoq, Greenland",One Greenland town turned itself into an open air sculpture gallery with the help of a series of traditional stone artworks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-and-man,"All throughout the Greenlandic town of Qaqortoq, carved into boulders and lichen-covered rock faces, are carvings of whales, faces, and other traditional designs. Together these stoneworks are a citywide work of art known as Stone & Man. The project is the work of local Qaqortoq artist Aka Høegh, who endeavored to turn her home town into a permanent open air art gallery, and essentially, a work of art in and of itself. With the help over a dozen artists hailing from other Nordic countries like Norway, Iceland, Finland, Sweden, and of course Greenland itself, Høegh oversaw the creation of 24 separate carvings and sculptures. Some of the works took the shape of fully shaped sculptures made out of local boulders, while others looked more like recreations of ancient tribal markings of fish and whales. More sculptures have been added to the collection over the years and now, Qaqortoq is home to around 40 sculptures and carvings spread around town. The majority of the Stone & Man works are clumped near the Qaqortoq Museum, which has an impressive collection of carved talismans in its collection for visitors who can’t get enough of Greenland’s traditional art. Qaqortoq might not be a very big town (although it is the fourth most populous in Greenland), but Stone & Man brings both its culture and its history to the fore.  This is the location of just one of the stone carvings. The rest are distributed throughout Qaqortoq, and local tours are available to guide you.",rocks sculptures geology art

In fact, when it was completed in 1932, Mindebrønden (Memorial Fountain) was the only fountain on the entire island. Construction on the Qaqortoq fountain, forged out of distinctive Igaliku sandstone, began in 1927. The subject matter is also endemic to Greenland. Several whales squirting water out of their blowholes are mounted at the top of the lantern-like base - a nod to the island’s whaling tradition (you’ll likely see some living ones in the fjords surrounding the city). Several smaller spouts arranged around the circular stone basin shoot delicate arcs of water towards the fountain’s center. Mindebrønden is hard to miss, as it’s right in the middle of the very tiny square that makes up Qaqortoq’s very tiny city center. Locals and tourists alike often gather here for lunch on the surrounding picnic tables. The fountain also shares the space with the Qaqortoq Museum, formerly a blacksmiths’ shop, which now showcases both modern art and Greenlandic handicrafts. The only other fountain in Greenland can be found further to the north, in Sisimiut. The center of town in a town so small, you can't miss it.",whales fountains animals
124,Garðar Cathedral Ruins,"Igaliku, Greenland",Walrus skulls and narwhal bones were found here while excavating a 900-year old church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gardar-cathedral-ruins,"In the early 12th-century, Norse settlers of Greenland established the first bishop seat on the island in the southern village of Garðar. There, a cathedral dedicated to Saint Nicholas, patron saint of sailors, was founded by Greenland’s first bishop Arnaldur in 1126. The church was composed of red sandstone and is the only known cruciform religious building in Greenland. The original structure was expanded in the following decades to include a bell tower and two chapels. During the 13th and 14th-centuries, the town of Garðar was a thriving farming village thanks to the mild weather. The farm around the cathedral was big enough to hold 100 cows and the bishop lived in a palace surrounded by wealth acquired by heavily taxing the population. Because of several factors such as the Black Death in Europe and a worsening climate that eventually led to the Little Ice Age, ships sailing from Norway to Greenland became rarer and the settlements were slowly abandoned. The last bishop that lived in Garðar died in 1378, but new bishops were appointed until 1537, even though none of them ever visited the diocese. Now, the settlement of Igaliku is located where Garðar once was, and excavations on the site of the former cathedral began in 1926. Walrus skulls and narwhal remains were found here, suggesting that a pagan temple could have been operating in or around the church. A skeleton of a powerful bishop was also found along with various religious ornaments.",cathedral artifacts temples ruins history & culture

When possible, the volunteers use Google Translate to deliver a handwritten response to the children (be they naughty or nice) in their native language. In addition to letters, Santa’s mailbox also receives a handy amount of pacifiers in the mail. (Apparently, many parents ween their kids off of their pacifiers by having them mailed to St. Nick.)

But reside together they did, in the 320-unit apartment complex that was not only the largest residential building in the town of Nuuk, but the largest in all of Greenland. In an attempt by the Danish parliament to eliminate coastal Inuit settlements and bring Greenland’s infrastructure into the modern day, the garish and unwelcoming Blok P came into being. Construction began in 1965, a 5-story monstrosity that stretched 64 apartments wide, Blok P was an eyesore from the very beginning, and not even remotely conducive to Inuit ways of life. Primarily fisherman, the reluctant residents of Blok P struggled to fit their fishing gear in the tiny closets designed more for shoes and handbags than bulky nets and poles. Much of their equipment ended up on balconies, blocking fire exits and eliminating any semblance of aesthetic charm the building may have had. Narrow hallways and doors weren’t wide enough for the giant fur coats that were an essential staple of everyone’s wardrobe, and the dwellings were cramped and uncomfortable. The most unpleasant oversight on the part of the Danes was the absence of a suitable place for the Inuits to gut their daily catch. For lack of a better solution, the fishermen used the only reasonable place—the bathtub. This resulted in drains clogged with coagulated blood and chunks of fish guts, a not-so-delightful addition to the already uncomfortable lodgings. In 2010 the government finally called it, started relocating residents, and scheduled the building for demolition. which took place in 2013. While the failed “urbanization project” is no more, it has inspired many community projects and artistic social exhibitions, most notably a permanent exhibit at the North Atlantic House, a cultural center in Copenhagen.",architectural oddities architecture

The International Dark Sky Association was formed in 1988 in the United States by astronomer Dr. David Crawford and physician Dr. Timothy Hunter to raise awareness of light pollution and its effect on our nighttime ability to stargaze. Sark’s placement, in the waters between France and England far from big-city lights, helped in its selection, as did its lack of automobiles and street lights. The citizens of Sark also made special accommodations, including adjusting existing lights in order to optimize the darkness. There are several other Dark Sky locations around the world, including Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah, Borrego Springs in California, and Hortobagy National Park in Hungary. With a population of just about 600, Sark has its own parliament and its own laws based in ancient Norman tradition.

The laborers, men and women of numerous nationalities, many of whom died in the tunnels’ construction, used explosives, drills, hand tools, and their bare hands to carve these tunnels from solid rock. The subterranean complex was intended for use as a German military hospital and ammunitions storehouse. By the time construction ceased at the onset of the D-Day invasion the hospital complex was large enough to house 500 patients and included facilities such as an operating room, X-ray room, dispensary, laboratory, and staff quarters, as well as a cinema, central heating plant, and kitchen. In addition to the three main entrances, the ventilation shafts were equipped with stairs and ladders so they could double as emergency exits. For all its planning, after three years of construction the hospital was only in use for around three months during the summer of 1944 when German casualties of the D-Day invasion filled all available wards. Hospital operations were eventually moved above ground when it became clear that the tunnels’ damp, dark atmosphere was not conducive to recovery. The ammunitions storage facilities fared slightly better, serving their intended purpose for around nine months. Although much of the remaining equipment was removed by Allied forces in 1945, some remnants of the hospital’s wartime use remain, including hospital beds, kitchen and heating equipment, and signs in German posted throughout. The tunnels are privately owned by Joyce Browning who opened them to the public in 1954.",subterranean sites
131,Sark Prison,"Sark, Guernsey",One of the world's smallest prisons boasts just two small cells.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sark-prison,"With room for just two prisoners, Sark Prison just may be the world’s smallest prison that’s still in use today. It doesn’t receive many inmates these days, but does sometimes host a seasonal worker or tourist after they’ve had one too many drinks. Sark is a fascinating little island in the Channel Islands, just off the coast of Normandy, France. Measuring just three miles long and one mile wide, and with a population of around 500, it’s one of the smallest of the inhabited Channel Islands. Despite its small size, Sark has a long and colorful history. It first appears in written history in 1040, when William of Normandy (later William the Conqueror) gave it as a gift to the Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey. It was captured by the French in 1549, but was soon retaken by the English, and was frequented by smugglers and pirates. More recently, the strategically important island was occupied by the Germans during World War II. It was also considered the last feudal state in Europe up until 2006, when universal suffrage and democracy were officially introduced. And in 2011, Sark had the honor of becoming the world’s first Dark Sky Island. Sark also has the distinction of being home to what is probably the smallest prison still in use in the world. Built in 1856, the tiny barrel-roofed jail has two adjoining cells, one measuring 6 feet by 6 feet and the other 6 feet by 8 feet. In front of the cells is a narrow three-foot wide corridor running the length of the building. There are no windows. One of the earliest known occupants was a young servant girl imprisoned for stealing a pocket handkerchief from her mistress. She was held in the prison for three days. She was so terrified of being locked up in the dark cell that the locals decided to let her put her chair in the open doorway, where local ladies sat with her, knitting and talking, until her time was served. These days, crimes on Sark are rare indeed. The island has two unpaid policemen, who bear the titles of Constable and Vingtenier (the Constable’s assistant). The last serious crime took place in 1990, when an unemployed French nuclear physicist named André Gardes launched a one-man invasion of the island, claiming to be the rightful Seigneur (or Lord) of Sark. He rowed across to the island armed with a semi-automatic weapon and put up two posters explaining his intentions. The following day he launched the second phase of his plan, but was promptly punched in the nose by the Constable and arrested. Since Gardes’s invasion, the Constable and Vingtenier have rarely had to concern themselves with more than an occasional drunk. Most of the prison’s temporary residents have been inebriated seasonal workers and intoxicated tourists, who have spent the night in one of the two cells until they sober up.  Sark Prison is located next to the Visitor Center just off Mill Lane in the center of the island. Sark is one of the Channel Islands, and lies about 7 miles east of Guernsey and about 25 miles west of the Cherbourg Peninsula of France. No cars are allowed on the island—only tractors—but it’s easy enough to get around on foot. And if you hear some people ""talking funny,"" it’s because they’re speaking Sercquiais, the Norman dialect of Sark.",prisons crime and punishment islands architectural oddities architecture

But for those in the know, the Szabo Ervin Library is a stunning step back to a time when libraries were like mansions - perhaps that’s because it’s in one. Built by Count Frigyes Wenckheim (1842 – 1912), a well-known Hungarian aristocrat at the end of the 19th century, the Central Library is easy to miss - today a modern library surrounds it, secreting away the beautifully preserved Wenckheim Palace. The City Council purchased the building and converted the beautiful palace rooms into reading rooms for their new library in 1931. The Hungarian neo-baroque arcitecture makes for a handsome backdrop to the walls of leather tomes. The old Dining Room, converted to a long reading room, centered by a long table, once for feasts, now for quiet contemplation, is an especially ambient place. The former Smoking Room, with its spiral staircase leading to a gallery also stands out. These two rooms are warmly lit and encased in dark wood. While it can be a confusing process to find the Central Library in the maze-like modern section of the library, once you do, all that is left is to pick out a beautiful old book, sink back into a deep leather chair, surrounded by the soft light of chandeliers, and relax like a 19th century Hungarian artistocrat.

We remember him now as Vlad the Impaler, better known as “Count Dracula” (though the tale is only fiction). For the forint equivalent of about six euros, you can walk through the Labyrinth tunnels. There’s no map or guidebook; you simply follow a few incoherent signs through foggy, damp chambers dotted with mannequins dolled up as characters from the Phantom of the Opera. About midway, you’ll come to the Maze of Darkness. Hold onto the green garden hose and walk through pitch blackness for about five minutes. Don’t let go of the hose, or you’ll end up lost amongst historical prison cells that haven’t been remodeled yet to be safe for tourists. Toward the end, you’ll walk past “Dracula’s chamber,” where a coffin is cast in eerie blue light. You can also try out some rusty shackles bolted to the wall and a “torture cage” that may or may not be safe to climb into.

135,Shoes on the Danube Promenade,"Budapest, Hungary",A trail of iron footwear stands as a monument to the thousands executed along this riverbank during WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shoes-on-the-danube-promenade,"In October of 1944, Hitler overthrew the leader of the Hungarian government, Miklos Horthy, and replaced him with Ferenc Szalasi. Szalasi, whose ideology closely followed Hitler’s, immediately established the Arrow Cross Party - a fascist, anti-semitic organization that brutally and publicly terrorized the Jews in Budapest by beating and killing them. Nearly 80,000 Jews were expelled from Hungary in a death march to the Austrian border and approximately 20,000 Jews were brutally shot along the banks of the Danube River. The victims were forced to remove their shoes at gunpoint (shoes being a valuable commodity during World War II) and face their executioner before they were shot without mercy, falling over the edge to be washed away by the freezing waters. Shoes on the Danube Promenade is a haunting tribute to this horrific time in history, created by film director Can Togay and the sculptor, Gyula Pauer. Installed along the bank of the Danube River in Budapest, the monument consists of 60 pairs of 1940s-style shoes, true to life in size and detail, sculpted out of iron. This memorial is simple yet chilling, depicting the shoes left behind by the thousands of Jews who were murdered by the Arrow Cross. The style of footwear - a man’s work boot; a business man’s loafer; a woman’s pair of heels; even the tiny shoes of a child - were chosen specifically to illustrate how no one, regardless of age, gender, or occupation was spared. Placed in a casual fashion, as if the people just stepped out of them, these little statues are a grim reminder of the souls who once occupied them - yet they also create a beautiful place of reflection and reverence. At three points along the memorial are cast iron signs with the following text in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew: “To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944–45. Erected 16 April 2005.” Located along the edge of the Danube River, on the Pest side, just south of the Hungarian Parliament Building.

136,Vajdahunyad Castle,"Budapest, Hungary",This Hungarian castle was built out of cardboard and wood until it proved so popular that it got upgraded to stone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vajdahunyad-castle,"Showcasing four distinct architectural styles, Vajdahunyad Castle is a thoroughly unique tribute to Hungary’s millennium-long architectural tradition. Designed by architect Ignác Alpár in 1896 as part of Hungary’s millennial celebrations (commemorating one thousand years since the medieval Magyars first settled on the plains of Pannonia), Vajdahunyad Castle was originally intended to be a temporary exhibition, and was constructed out of wood and cardboard.  However, the attraction proved such a hit with locals and visitors alike that a more permanent structure was built in 1904. The castle itself is divided into four sections, showcasing Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance, and Romanesque architecture.  Within each section, the castle is further divided, in total comprising twenty-one smaller buildings linked together, each having been designed as a replica of other significant structures to be found throughout Hungary and Romania.  Perhaps the most striking section of the castle is the Gothic wing, modeled on Corvin Castle in Romania, which served as the historical home of János Hunyadi, the Hungarian noble from whom Vajdahunyad Castle derives its name. Located on an artificial island in the heart of Budapest within spitting distance of Hungary’s national monument, Vajdahunyad Castle nonetheless presents an odd contrast to its stately surroundings.  The clash of colors, patterns, engravings, and building materials give the structure an almost funhouse-like appearance, and eerie statues of Béla Lugosi and the anonymous author of the Gesta Hungarorum, “the deeds of the Hungarians,” on the castle grounds add to the site’s dreamy ambiance. The castle also houses the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture.",castles architectural oddities architecture
137,Budapest Castle Hill Funicular,"Budapest, Hungary","Built in 1870 at the bridge that connected Buda and Pest, this spectacular incline railway was almost lost forever during World War II.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/budapest-castle-hill-funicular,"At the bottom of Castle Hill is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge, Hungary’s first permanent structure to cross the Danube River. It opened in 1849, and the solid span of wrought iron and stone connected Buda and Pest, the two sides of the capital city. At the top of the hill, rising over 300 feet at an almost 40-degree incline, is Buda Castle—with no easy way, at the time, to get there from the bridge. That changed 21 years later with the opening of the Budavári Sikló, Europe’s second funicular railway. For the next 70-odd years the stepped cars took passengers up and down the equivalent of 30 flights of stairs. Those trips ended during World War II, when the line was destroyed during the bombing of Budapest. Funiculars, also called incline or cable railways, go back hundreds of years. They use a fairly simple pulley system, harnessing the cars’ own counterweight to scoot up and down steep grades like Castle Hill. Without the Budavári Sikló to handle the job, access to Buda Castle meant taking the circuitous route of an autobus. Or worse, walking. Luckily pieces of the funicular had been salvaged after the bombing. It took a long time, but in 1986 the little-railway-that-could reopened along its original track, with most of its original design. It’s now operated by Budapest Public Transport, serving both head-down commuters and eyes-up tourists. The panoramic views of the Danube and west side of the city are unparalleled, and in 1987 the entire Buda Castle District, including the Budavári Sikló, was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Supposedly once the home of a hermit monk, the cave is today run by the Pauline Monks. The relationship between the Hungarian government and the “Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit” hasn’t always been good. The entire Pauline order was arrested on Easter Monday, 1951, by the Communist government and charged with treason. The head monk was executed, the rest were put into labor camps and the church was sealed behind an eight-foot wall of concrete. In 1989, after the fall of communism in Hungary, the wall was broken down and the cave reopened. Today, the cave walls are all made from concrete and “faux cave,” but the small church still contains some curious features. Besides being rumored to connect to a vast system of underground tunnels, the cave church has a replica of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, Poland. Black Madonnas are paintings or statues of the Virgin Mary that, for debated reasons, have turned black. Black Madonnas are held to be miraculous and one in particular is said to have saved her Pauline church from fire. Since then the Pauline Monks have worshiped her mysteriously dark visage.

In 2000, the ˝The Public Foundation for the Research of Central and East European History and Society˝ purchased what is now called the “Terror House” with the aim of building a museum that would recreate the conditions victims of political brutality faced for decades in Hungary. As the building was used for offices for decades, architects János Sándor and Kálmán Újszászy chose to restore the building back to its original gloominess, and to complete the multi-sensory feel of the space, composer Ákos Kovács created a morose background score.

The décor of Red Ruin, a quirky communism theme bar, delightfully subverts communist propaganda with colorful pop art and puns; the drinks are appropriately named and priced to the “people”. The first thing you see when you walk into Red Ruin is a mural of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong in birthday hats, having an enthusiastic “communist party.” Popular with locals and tourists, the bar features kitschy attractions like florescent red lighting, a cardboard poster of Marx and Lenin that you can put your face through, and pop art stencils of Stalin with the caption “Joseph Stylin.” The bar’s labyrinthine, redbrick basement (the entrance to which is easy to miss) features even more wall art and communism jokes.

The former factory has multiple levels and a maze of different rooms, each its own curiosity shop. Now a pub, its decor is a hodgepodge of items, including a kangaroo statue, a Trabant car (in which you can sit and drink), and a bathtub cut open on one side to serve as a couch. There’s graffiti on the walls, and the exposed brick conceals nothing of the building’s structural core. Disco balls hang overhead, as do upturned chairs, and plants sprout up in its large, open-air garden. There’s a method to this madness, which is to elevate items that might be considered junk to the stature of high design. Szimpla Kert, Budapest’s first “ruin bar,” opened in an abandoned factory in 2002, a far cry from elegantly outfitted trendy watering holes. Ruin bars have since become some of the coolest spots in the Hungarian city, seen as successful endeavors at repurposing decaying urban structures into lively communal spaces. But some of these buildings have tragic histories that cannot be overlooked, especially in District VII (also known as Erzsébetváros), which was previously Budapest’s Jewish quarter. Szimpla Kert’s space in particular was once a brick and furnace (some sources say fireplace) factory. By some accounts, the Jewish factory owners were deported during World War II, and the building went through several iterations, becoming a furniture factory and a multi-family residence, before it was vacated completely. As part of an effort to revitalize the neighborhood, Szimpla Kert now hosts regular community events, including a weekly farmer’s market, a flea market, and fundraising programs. It is, however, most well-known for its decor and its entertainment. There are film screenings, theater shows, a “self-awareness disco,” and even a recording studio tucked somewhere in the maze. During the day, the pub is open for food, coffee, live music, and pop-up exhibits. By night, the psychedelic lights turn on and indie bands take the stage. One curious bar offering: a jar of peeled, raw carrots, which are actually quite popular. Carrots or not, both visitors and locals flock to Szimpla Kert for its carefully curated decor, food, drinks, and music.  The best time to go is in the summer months (June to August).

142,The Citadella,"Budapest, Hungary","From Austrians to Nazis to Soviets, this historic Budapest fortress has a history as complex as the city itself.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-citadella-budapest-hungary,"The Citadella was constructed in 1854 by the Hapsburgs as part of their strategy to supervise formerly rebellious Budapest and Hungary to prevent another uprising. The Citadella remains a symbol of oppression as well as liberty. A massive structure 220 meters long, 60 meters wide, and 4 meters tall, the Citadella was occupied by the Austrians until 1899. The locals, still angered by that symbol of foreign oppression started the demolition of the walls, however, most of the citadel structure still stands, and was subsequently used by both Nazis and Communists as a surveillance position, taking advantage of its amazing view over the city. The Nazis used the Citadella mainly as an anti-aircraft position and bunker. Once the Red Army advanced to the city and recovered the territory, the Citadella was used by the Communists as well. After the Hungarian uprising in 1956, the mounted weapons were pointed not to the skies but to the civilian population below. The Communists also took advantage of the high position of the structure and decided to erect a monument that would remind the locals of the sacrifice made by the Eastern liberators who freed the city from the German invaders. Once the monument was finished, it displayed five statues: A woman carrying a torch, representing progress; a man fighting a five-headed dragon symbolizing the struggle against the forces of evil (the Axis powers probably); two Red Army soldiers, representing the liberators; and atop the monument, a 14-meter statue of a woman holding a palm leaf with both hands up to the sky, representing liberty. Once the Communist influence vanished after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the statue of the Red Army soldiers were removed and taken to the Statue Park along with the remaining works of art honoring the invaders of an occupation that lasted four decades. Nowadays the Citadella remains a popular tourist destination. It is a fascinating site where one can see all the wonders of a city that has been called the Paris of Central Europe, as well as explore its troubled history. Update as of December 2019: The interior of the Citadella is currently closed indefinitely to the public.  The Citadella can be reached by bus 27 from Móricz Zsigmond körtér.

But the most interesting element of the museum is the story of Semmelweis himself. Semmelweis worked during the mid-1800s in the maternity ward of a clinic. Women in maternity wards all over the world were experiencing a mysterious disease called”childbed sickness,” today known as puerperal fever. As many as 30% of mothers died from this disease every month. Semmelweis was tormented over the deaths of so many women, but couldn’t figure out the cause. One day, a colleague died shortly after performing an autopsy, and in a flash of insight, Semmelweis realized that his coworker had had a cut on his finger when he preformed the dissection. It became obvious to Semmelweis that doctors moving immediately from cadavers to pregnant women was not the best idea. Semmelweis implemented a strict hand-washing policy in his clinic, requiring doctors to scrub with chloride of lime, an antiseptic. He also instituted an instrument-washing policy. The death-rate fell noticeably. Semmelweis reported his findings to the great Medical Association of Vienna, but this was several years before Pasteur’s experiments confirmed germ theory; even Semmelweis himself was not sure why his discovery worked. So to most of the medical community, hand-washing simply didn’t make sense. Semmelweis’s discovery was soundly rejected, and in a cruel twist of irony, Semmelweis died — of the very disease he spent his life trying to prevent in others — before seeing his discoveries accepted by the medical community. Clemente Susini’s wax models, painstaking to produce and incredibly fragile, can be seen in only a few other locations throughout the world, including La Specola Museum in Florence, the Josephinum in Vienna, and the Wax Anatomy Museum ot University of Cagliari. — Atlas Obscura visited the Semmelweis Museum on Obscura Day - March 20, 2010",anatomical venuses wax anatomy obscura day locations medical museums

145,Epreskert Garden,"Budapest, Hungary",The romantic garden was the epicenter of the Hungarian art scene in the 1880s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/epreskert-garden,"Many Budapest locals have heard the name Epreskert, but only a few are actually familiar with the history of the aesthetic wonderland hidden behind the garden walls. The park has been one of the most important bases for the city’s art scene for well over a century now. The romantically named Epreskert (translated as “Mulberry Garden” or “Strawberry Garden”) near Andrássy Avenue was originally a municipal mulberry field, farmed until the 1870s. As the area became urbanized, the city donated pieces of the land to artists who had performed municipal work. The first was sculptor Adolf Huzsár, who established his studio right outside the garden. The Hungarian University of Fine Arts moved into the plot on the north side of the garden, while on Sugár Street more artists arrived, following Huzsár’s example. The green space in the middle was the artists’ personal garden; during any given stroll one might run into some of the best Hungarian artists of the Belle Époque. With the support of local government, the artists molded Epreskert into a beautiful public space. Several pavilions were installed outside the studios. Alajos Stróbl, renowned sculptor and a professor at the university, landscaped the mulberry garden. With the help of his students, Stróbl also dismantled a 150-year-old chapel in Kálvária Square and transferred it to its present location in Epreskert, stone by stone. He was also known to keep exotic animals, including monkeys, peacocks, deer, and storks, as well as goldfish in his fountain. By the 1880s the Epreskert Artists Colony was well established. Those who could afford it bought mansions and apartments in the booming neighborhood. The sculptors had Lendvay Street, the painters had Bajza Street, and social life was truly blooming in the joint mansion of novelist Mór Jókai and painter Árpád Feszty, since the writer’s adopted daughter married the famous panorama artist. As the colony was gifted by the local government, it followed that only those with the best connections were able to live there. This also meant that Emperor Franz Joseph, among other royals, frequently visited Epreskert and held regal soirees among the bohemians here. By the early 1900s the art scene in Budapest had changed and dispersed. Thankfully though, much of Epreskert’s Belle Époque charm has been preserved by the University of Fine Arts. The garden is only open to the public at particular times, such as during year-end exhibitions when modern art students display their work among the same mulberry bushes as the masters of the 19th century.  The garden can only be visited at select times.",sculpture gardens gardens sculptures plants art
146,The Golden Eagle Pharmacy Museum,"Budapest, Hungary",A Hungarian pharmacy museum with a box full of mummy powder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golden-eagle-pharmacy-museum,"What began as a private collection of pharmaceutical oddities in 1896 became a museum in 1948. Called a collection of “Historical Chemist Relics,” it is better described as an alchemy museum. Among the curious items in this small museum is a bottle of Ambra Grisea Malac (Ambergris, or Sperm Whale vomit), for use on “Lean, thin, emaciated persons who take cold easily” and those who “with great sadness, sit for days weeping.” Besides the hanging bats, lizards and crocodiles, worth looking for is the box of mumia or mummy powder. Easily spotted by the decaying head on top, it is what it sounds like: the powder is made of ground-up mummies meant to be eaten or applied as a salve. All of which was the result of a poor translation. The Arabs were very fond of using Bitumen (a tar like substance) in their medicine. It bubbled up from the ground in the mountains of Persia and was an excellent way to staunch wounds. They called this stuff mumia. After the Arabs invaded Egypt, they also began calling those cloth wrapped bodies the Ancient Egyptians left laying everywhere mumia as well. They thought the bodies were prepared with bitumen, like the Greeks and Romans embalmed their dead (in fact they weren’t; the Egyptian mummies were prepared with a natural salt.) In the twelfth century, aided by the crusades, and a poor translation by Gerard of Cremona, it was decided that bitumen and mumia were one and the same. The black stuff came from mummies, and mummies were prepared in the black stuff, so you could use one for the other. By the 1400s the mummy trade was in full effect. Mummy powder was being used for everything from epilepsy to upset stomaches. Of course, mummies are rather hard to come by. The entire stock of thousands of mummies (likely the Guanche aristocracy) found on Canary Island was used up in a matter of years. Merchants even began making new mummies to satisfy the demands. They would buy the recently deceased, stuff them full of herbs and leave them out to dry. By the 1600s mummies were big business and everyone who was anyone used it. Francis Bacon loved it, so did Francis I of France. Shakespeare wrote about it in Othello and Macbeth, while his son-in-law John Hall prescribed it to his ill patients. The mummy trade eventually slowed mainly due to a tightening of Egyptian government on the practice, and the ever more difficult process of finding and smuggling authentic mummies. Mummy was still available in the catalog of Merck as late as 1908: “Genuine Egyptian mummy, as long as the supply lasts, 17 marks 50 per kilogram.” The jar of mumia at the Golden Eagle Pharmacy Museum is a rare little reminder of this past.",pharmacy museums mummies museums
147,Memento Park,"Budapest, Hungary","Budapest's Communist-era statues, banished to the suburbs.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memento-park,"When Communism collapsed in Hungary in 1989, the city of Budapest was left with many public works of art that celebrated that era. In 1993, four years after the fall, the city government decided to save the statues rather than destroy them and the idea for the Memento Park was born. Twenty minutes outside Budapest’s city center, the open-air Memento Park displays more than 40 Communist-era statues in a neutral setting, neither making a mockery of them nor honoring them. The park was designed by Hungarian architect, Ákos Eleőd, who won the competition announced by the Budapest General Assembly in 1991. Perhaps the most curious item in the park is a 1:1 replica of Stalin’s giant boots. A huge eight-meter statue of Stalin once stood in the “Felvonulási tér” in central Budapest serving as a rallying point and parade route for the communist regime. On the 23rd of October 1956, the Hungarians revolted against the communist regime and pulled down the huge statue leaving only Stalin’s giant boots behind. Though the revolution was brutally crushed by Communist forces, the replica of the boots serves as a reminder of those lost in the Hungarian uprising. Approximately 40,000 people visit Memento Park yearly.

148,The Garden of Philosophers,"Budapest, Hungary",Tucked away near more famous landmarks lies a statue meant to symbolize the confluence and continuing development of human culture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-garden-of-philosophy-budapest-hungary,"In a secret corner of Budapest’s Gellért Hill, the world’s greatest religious figures meet silently around an orb. At least, that’s what Hungarian sculptor Nándor Wagner envisioned when he created “The Garden of Philosophy,” a cluster of statues you may happen upon if you wander away from the major tourist attractions of the Citadel and the Liberty Statue, perched atop the crown of the popular hill overlooking the Danube. The sculpture, created in 1997 (the year of Wagner’s death), found its secluded hillside home in 2001. Wagner’s intention for the piece was to promote mutual understanding among the world’s religions. The group of statues features an inner circle composed of what Wagner saw as the five founders of the world’s major religions: Abraham, Jesus, Buddha, Laozi, and Akhenaten. The orb they gather around is about the size of a fist and intended to represent the similarities in what is worshiped by these major schools of thought. Akhenaten, the Egyptian pharaoh who began his reign as Amenhotep IV and changed his name as part of his attempt to shift Egypt to a monotheism centered around the sun god Aten, seems an odd choice here and stands out physically as well. He is built smaller than his companions, wearing a large Egyptian war crown that at first glance resembles the bulbous brain of a classic sci-fi alien. Gazing from the sidelines at this surreal meeting of the minds are Mahatma Gandhi, Daruma Daishi (aka Bodhidharma), and Saint Francis, who Wagner saw as leaders in fostering spiritual enlightenment. Gandhi’s statue is the most recognizable. Wagner intended for the sculpture to include a third circle of figures composed of the great lawmakers Hammurabi, Moses, Justinian, and Prince Shotoku, but was unable to complete that part of the project before his untimely passing due to cancer. If the overall style of the sculptures looks somewhat Asian, it’s because Wagner spent the last 25 years of his life living and working in Japan. In fact, another version of the statue group was cast and presented in the Japanese town of Mashiko. Nearby to the Hungarian version, you will find a striking view of the city of Budapest as well as a statue of the personified Prince Buda embracing his wife, a personified Princess Pest (Budapest being composed of the two formerly separate cities of Buda and Pest).

Installed in 2014 at an estimated cost of $63,000, the bronze lieutenant was part of an overall rejuvenation project in the area, although exactly why the figure was chosen is a bit of a mystery. According to organizers, actor Peter Falk may have been related to the 19th-century Hungarian political figure, Miksa Falk, after whom the street is named, although they also admit that this connection has yet to be proven. The American Falk is known to have had Hungarian roots on one side of his family, although it has never been linked to Miksa Falk’s family. Some have also questioned the timing of the statue’s installation given that Peter Falk passed away in 2011, meaning that it is unlikely to commemorate his passing either. Many believe that it was unveiled in time to garner votes in an upcoming election, although this seems to be a strange way to go about it. Just one more thing… At the foot of the metal lieutenant’s feet is a bronze basset hound modeled after a local dog named Franzi, who even showed up for the unveiling. This is of course supposed to be Columbo’s droopy-faced pet, “Dog.” Unfortunately, the dog does not seem to provide any further clues to the decision-making process behind the statue’s bizarre existence. Maybe if Columbo were still alive, he’d be able to solve the case. There is also a little bronze squirrel with a gun right behind Colombo.

The occasion is Saint Stephen’s Day, a day dedicated to celebrating the founder of the Hungarian nation. Curiously, St. Stephen, or a least a part of him, faithfully attends his celebration every year. The Holy Right is the right fist of St. Stephen himself and his relic leads the parade each year. Saint Stephen was canonized in 1083, and as part of the process of saint-ing, his corpse was exhumed from his crypt. It is said that his right arm (though not the rest of him apparently) was found to be as fresh as the day he was buried. The supple arm was promptly lopped off to be preserved and venerated. The mummified hand went through a number of owners before returning to Hungary. In the 13th century during the Tartar invasion, it was sent to Dubrovnik in Croatia for safekeeping by the Dominican monks. It is believed that around this time the monks cut the hand from the arm and sent the upper arm to Lemburg, and the lower arm to Vienna. A common practice in those days was to keep each branch of the church from getting jealous. In 1771, the Austro-Hungarian empire took the Holy Right and placed it in Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna (the Hapsburg’s summer home) before eventually returning it to Hungary. However as the front of WWll approached Budapest in 1944, the Holy Right was again taken back into Austria and was kept by the archbishop of Salzburg. At long last, on August 20, 1945, the priest of the American army brought the hand from Austria to its rightful Hungarian owners. Today, the mummified “Holy Right” resides in an ornate golden reliquary in the Basilica of St. Stephen. Drawn into a tight fist and clutching precious jewels, the hand—now shrunken and yellowed—still manages an air of righteous defiance.  To see the hand, go to the right side of the Basilica and put a 200 Forint coin in the slot. A light will then illuminate the Holy Right for about a minute.

151,Gyermekvasút,"Budapest, Hungary",This quaint Hungarian railway system is operated exclusively by children between the ages of 10 and 14.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gyermekvasut,"Stretching through a lovely patch of quiet Hungarian forest, the Gyermekvasút rail line would seem to be just another peaceful sightseeing rail line were it not for the captain and crew being exclusively underage. Following in the footsteps of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, Hungary first conceived of a railway staffed by children all the way back in 1947. As opposed to a strange governmental child labor scheme, the project was seen as a way of training young men and women important trade skills and as an honorable position to take pride in. When the rail line first rumbled to life it consisted of three passenger lines which were nearly an instant hit, filling with passengers each day it ran. The popularity of the line continued for decades before the lure of tourism abroad pulled attention away from the kiddie-staffed train lines. It wasn’t until 1990 that the railway regained its former glory. As Hungary pulled itself out of a Communist regime, eyes and thoughts began turning to domestic tourism again and the old Pioneer’s Railway seemed like just the thing. The lines and train cars were refurnished in the ensuing years and the name was officially changed to Gyermekvasút (translated as “Children’s Railway”), a monicker that had always been unofficially associated with the train. This time the emphasis was less on getting locals from one place to another, and was changed to attracting tourists would come to see the child workers and enjoy the ride for the natural beauty the trains passed through. The gamble worked making the train one of the more popular attractions in the area. Currently the Gyermekvasút is the world’s largest child’s railway in the world.  In early December, the railway offers a St. Nicolas “Szent Mikulas” train ride for three-days. Children dressed as St. Nick's helpers lead songs and games in each train car (in Hungarian), while St. Nick visits each train car to deliver a bag of candy to each child. The train cars are decorated with Christmas lights. The train ride lasts about 40 minutes.",railroads trains

153,Hospital in the Rock,"Budapest, Hungary",A museum dedicated to a secret military hospital hidden beneath a castle in Budapest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hospital-in-the-rock,"Hidden among the nearly six miles of natural caves and tunnels beneath Buda Castle Hill is the Hospital in the Rock Museum, which preserves the history and rooms of a secret underground hospital that was later turned into a nuclear fallout shelter. During World War II some of the fortified caves beneath Budapest’s Buda Castle were being used as an air raid shelter but the Mayor of the city saw more than a defensive use for the facility. A secret surgical hospital was built under the hill which ministered to victims of the war both during and after formal hostilities were underway. In 1958, with the fear of Cold War WMD’s gripping countries across the globe, the hospital was expanded to include shelters from both nuclear and chemical attack. Luckily the shelters never had to be used, and eventually the facility was opened to the public as a museum in 2008. Today the Hospital in the Rock Museum lets guests wander through the cramped operating theaters and machinery filled nuclear bunkers, all of which have been restored to their wartime conditions. Gruesome (and not a little creepy) mannequins reenact medical scenes and visitors can even take part in a competitive nuclear readiness drill against other tourists. The Hospital in the Rock is just one section of the miles of tunnel beneath Buda Castle, with other sections being taken up by wonders such as the Labyrinth, but the hospital museum may be the most historically enlightening.",hospitals subterranean military history subterranean sites military museums and collections museums
154,Central Café and Restaurant 1887,"Budapest, Hungary",Some of the greatest minds in the history of Hungarian art and science converged in this café.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-cafe-and-restaurant-1887,"If you are a literature lover with a penchant for the historical (and the Hungarian), Budapest’s Central Café and Restaurant 1887 is for you. Much like the cobblestoned streets of the city outside, the elongated dining hall feels is frozen in time, specifically, a time of ornate moldings framing a 40-foot ceiling, white table cloths, and flashy marble columns. Large windows highlight the fact that it was the place to see but, more importantly, be seen in late 19th-century Budapest. Sandwiched with a library on one side and a printing press on the other, it became the perfect spot for the intellectual elite to kill time and engage in esoteric debates while waiting for their works to be pressed and printed. From its opening in 1887 to 1944, the café attracted a who’s who of Hungarian poets, artists, scientists, and authors. The café shuttered in late 1944 when Soviet and Romanian forces laid siege to Budapest. At the war’s end, the building required much reconstruction. Repairs sought to restore the café to its original glory, demanding a brick-by-brick rebuilding of the entire interior based on old photographs. The original furniture was salvaged and displayed in the café, including the chandeliers, grand piano, and marble-countertop bar. Black-and-white photographs of Hungarian luminaries cover the walls, including writers and philosophers who sat for hours in the café, composing some of the country’s most influential works and theories. Legend has it that Frigyes Karinthy devised the theory of “six degrees of separation” and that Gyula Krúdy wrote his Sindbad tales inside. Don’t mind the portraits of famous Hungarian intellectuals looking down as you sip coffee and indulge in a menu of Hungarian classics, from goulash to red wine beef cheeks to chicken paprikash stew. However, Central Café is not satisfied with simply sitting on its laurels. The café actively pushes modern visitors to channel their creative minds to engage and be engaged. The bars are stocked with new and old newspapers. The waiters have interactive roles, encouraged by management to spend as long as possible conversing with customers. On each place setting is a card that reads “Be a Poet!” along with a titbit about a famous writer who likely sat in that very seat at one point. There’s also a wooden pencil for your use, daring customers to create something of their own. Update as of February 2022: The cafe is closed indefinitely. Update as of June 2022: The cafe is open again.",literature restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars world war ii military
155,Béla Lugosi Bust at Vajdahunyad Castle,"Budapest, Hungary","Late at night, the bust of the ""Dracula"" actor was snuck onto the facade of this Budapest castle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bela-lugosi-bust-at-vajdahunyad-castle,"The Kinks, Bauhaus, and Andy Warhol have all paid homage to Béla Lugosi. And now his likeness adorns a Hungarian castle. In 2003, German artist Hartmut Zech made a bust of Béla Lugosi. In July that year, when he and some friends took a trip to Budapest, he brought it along in hopes of finding a home for the sculpture. In City Park, he noticed an empty alcove on a corner of the Vajdahunyad Castle, and late that night, with help from his friends, installed the statue on a ledge about 10 feet up the facade. Vajdahunyad Castle is an architectural collage built to pay homage to several landmark buildings in Hungary’s 1,000-year history. It was built in 1896 for the Millennial Exhibition to celebrate the anniversary of the Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin in 895. The Hungarian-American actor Béla Lugosi was born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in Lugos, Kingdom of Hungary (now Lugoj, Romania). He’s known for portraying the eponymous character in Dracula on Broadway in 1927 and in the 1931 film adaptation (both loosely based on Bram Stoker’s novel) as well as his later work in Ed Wood’s films, including the cult classic Plan 9 From Outer Space. The Lugosi bust was the fifth sculpture that Zech “gifted” to a foreign country. The first was a Jim Morrison bust he hid in a stroller and pushed into the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, where the singer is buried. That one came down within days. Other statues went up in different places, with varying degrees of permission and success. But the bust of Béla Lugosi remains—an additional bit of Hungarian history for the castle’s visitors to celebrate.",dracula vampires film castles sculptures
156,The Hungarian Geological Institute Building,"Budapest, Hungary",This hidden art nouveau gem was designed by an architect in search of a national style.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-hungarian-geological-institute-building-budapest-hungary,"In the late 19th century, the Hungarian Geological Society decided that they required a new building to house their activities. However, in that age of nationalism, not just any building would do; to fulfill their needs, they engaged an architect who had set out to create a wholly unique Hungarian style of architecture. Commissioned in 1896 and officially opened in 1899, the building commissioned by the society (now the Hungarian Geological Institute) was designed by Ödön Lechner. Trained locally as well as in Berlin and Paris, Lechner was the father of the Hungarian art nouveau movement known as Szecesszió (aka, Hungarian Secessionist) characterized by its use of brightly colored ceramics and incorporation of contemporary trends, organic motifs, eastern design details, and Hungarian folk art elements. Nicknamed the “Hungarian Gaudí,” most of Lechner’s most interesting works actually predate the Catalan architect’s world famous landmarks (if only by a few years). The Institute’s building is one of the most striking examples of the Szecesszió movement, most notable at first glance for its turquoise and blue tiled roof (materials for which came from the renowned and innovative Hungarian ceramics manufacturer Zsolnay). The color and shape of the roof is meant to represent the ancient Tethys Ocean, and other details of the building similarly merge architectural and geological themes, such as cave-like mosaics on the flooring at the entrance and details of fossils decorating the exterior. Engraved windows throughout the museum bear typical Hungarian flower motifs, and the entire building is crowned with a statue of human figures holding up a globe. The building still serves as the home of the Hungarian Geological Institute, which is the country’s oldest scientific research institute. Additionally, the building houses the Geological Museum of Budapest, which boasts the largest geological collection in the country, with 23 thematic collections with over 180,000 inventoried fossils, minerals, rocks, and photos, and can be visited for free on weekdays (though the visit must be arranged in advance). Even without the scientific treasures contained inside, though, the Hungarian Geological Institute Building bears witness to one visionary’s creation of a new local language of form, and is a stunning addition to the charming Budapest skyline.

157,Budapest Agriculture Museum,"Budapest, Hungary",A fake Transylvanian castle houses a cathedral of antlers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/budapest-agriculture-museum,"Vajdahunyad Castle is nestled within the shady trees, pebbled paths, and placid ponds of Budapest’s City Park. It may look distinctly Baroque Eastern European, but it’s not quite what it seems. The Vajdahunyad Castle is a copy of a castle by the same name in Transylvania, Romania. When it was first built in the city park, it was made of cardboard as a temporary exhibit for the Hungarian millennial exhibition in 1896, but the beautiful castle was so popular, they decided to make it a permanent fixture. Stone and brick, statues and thousands of agricultural artifacts later, the fake castle is a proud feature of Budapest’s City Park today. When the castle was finished in 1908, it became the home of the Hungarian Agricultural Museum. A trip to the museum is worth being inside the lovely folly of a castle, but a climb up the imposing stone staircase reveals something altogether more exciting. Hundreds of antlers, horns, hooves, and fur. Stuffed birds and mounted bears. Cutlery with horn handles carved into foxes. Antler broaches, antler chandeliers, and antler chairs. It is known as “The Hall of Hunting.” With beautiful vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows, along with the fact that the Agricultaral Museum is often empty, this top floor feels like the church of a long lost deer deity. Echoed footsteps and hushed whispers lend a quiet respect to these relics of the hunt. It’s a wonder that the Agricultural Museum of Budapest has anything at all. The collection has been destroyed not once, but twice since its opening 100 years ago. WWII came through, and about 10 years later, just as the collection was coming back together, the freedom fighters of the Hungarian uprising of 1956 tore through the hall of antlers and taxidermy displays. But through many donations and loving attention, this shrine of the dead animal has been restored to its former glory. The museum also features exhibits on the history of Hungarian agriculture from the beginning to present, domestication of animals, forestry, fishing, and plant life.

158,Cinkota Old Cemetery,"Budapest, Hungary",A forgotten graveyard lost in the tangles of an overgrown garden.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cinkota-old-cemetery,"There is a place on the outskirts of Budapest that is more similar to Sleepy Hollow than the city you may imagine. It’s called Cinkota, and used to be a lovely little agricultural village a short distance from the buzz of the city. An old, forgotten cemetery obscured by tangles of plants and the passage of time preserves bits of the neighborhood’s past. The thickets of flora make the cemetery feel invisible, like it’s lost within a secret, savage garden that grows in the shadow of a centuries-old church. Prolific greens and the roots of old trees crawl atop the marble tombstones. Insects chirr and various birds tweet, a lazy cat yawns and licks its coal-black fur comfortably in a lap of a statue of an angel. It’s easy to forget it’s a cemetery at all, that is until you notice the graves speckled among the leaves. Many of the graves have sunken into the earth and have been engulfed by nature. Only a few tombstones defy time and still stand, though they are cracked and broken. Some graves are so aged it’s impossible to read the names and dates etched into them. A few of the newer markers have pictures on them, images of people in traditional clothing that were captured by a camera then burned into the stone. Exploring the area around the cemetery also feels like entering a different time. Cinkota still has the atmosphere of a village, even though it’s been swallowed by Hungary’s capital city. Chickens and ducks peck the ground in the backyards of houses capped with red-tiled roofs and historical homes from different eras line the crooked streets. Entry is free. Open hours: always. And maybe forever.",death graveyards burial places cemeteries
159,Zwack Unicum Museum,"Budapest, Hungary",Central Europe's largest collection of mini-bottles is on display at this museum devoted to a bitter Hungarian liquor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zwack-unicum-museum,"Sometimes referred to as the Hungarian national spirit, the Zwack family’s signature liquor, Unicum is over two centuries old and the history of this wince-inducing tipple is on display alongside Central Europe’s largest collection of mini alcohol bottles right in the Zwack distillery. Unicum was originally invented in the late 1700s by King of Hungary Joseph II’s royal physician, Doctor Zwack. The super secret recipe which famously contains more than 40 different herbs was passed through the family line, becoming an unofficial national drink. Even when the family was exiled under Communist rule, the recipe was given to a confidant so that the drink could continue to be produced until the Zwacks could return, which they eventually did, founding the large distillery that stands today. The drink itself, a thick digestive, is known to be an acquired taste due to its (generously described) hearty flavor. Its bottle shape which is not unlike that of a cartoon wizard’s potion bottle, is yet another of the drink’s distinctive features. Inside of the museum located on the distillery grounds there is a video telling the story of the Zwack family and a tour through the history of the drink. Along the way the gallery walls are covered in display cases filled with a massive collection of mini liquor bottles numbering over 17,000, making it the largest collection in Central Europe. The tour finishes out in the basement where bold tasters can sample the varieties of Unicum straight from the oak barrels in which they are still aged for half a year. Unicum is no longer sold straight in the United States, instead a watered-down version simply called, Zwack is the only version imported. Whether this is because Americans can’t handle the ultra-bitter medicinal taste or just because Hungary is simply protective of their beloved aperitif is not explained during the tour.",food museums museums and collections food museums
160,Péter Mansfeld Monument,"Budapest, Hungary",This statue of a falling man commemorates a teenage martyr of the Hungarian Revolution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peter-mansfeld-monument-man-falling-into-death,"What appears to be a piece of expressionist art—a man falling headfirst towards the pavement—is actually a memorial for a Hungarian revolutionary, Péter Mansfeld, who was martyred for the cause in 1959. The Hungarian Revolution began with students, who mounted a peaceful demonstration against the Soviet regime in Budapest on October 23, 1956. Unrest had been brewing for some time, evidenced by the 200,000 people who turned out to call for an independent Hungary. They dismantled communist icons and flags throughout town. Many of the activists were just teenagers, including Péter Mansfeld, then just 16 years old. When protest leaders attempted to storm the Radio Budapest building to broadcast a list of their liberation demands, they were stopped by the Soviet Secret Police. The crowd grew unruly, the police opened fire, and all hell broke loose. Central Budapest was a war zone for the months to come, the streets lined with burning cars and police barricades. The Soviet police attempted to hide their weapons throughout the city in places like empty ambulances, but the protesters found and stole them. As the revolution was winding down, Péter Mansfeld and four other teenage freedom fighters continued hoarding guns and grenades in the event the rebels needed them again. They broke into the Minister of the Interior’s villa to steal ammunitions, and narrowly escaped a plainclothes police officer on their way out. In 1958 they stole a car and kidnapped a police officer on another weapons mission. The youngest of the revolutionaries grew frightened as the authorities circled closer on the five boys, and told his parents, who, as loyal communists, turned them in immediately. While police were investigating the site where the guns were hidden (beneath Budapest Castle), Mansfeld made an escape, leaping from a 13-foot-high ledge in the Rose Hill neighborhood and breaking his hand in the process. This escape was futile though; he was found the very next day. Mansfeld had been arrested earlier in the month for stealing a car and disseminating anti-Communist leaflets on the street. These offenses, coupled with charges of abduction, theft, harboring arms, and committing violence against the state were evidence enough of his deviance. The Soviet government planned to make an example of the five young rebels. It was determined that Mansfeld and his companion, József Blasko, were the ringleaders. The prosecution urged the judge not to go easy on the accused because of their age, but instead to order the most “draconian rigors” possible for the political traitors. Blasko was given a life sentence, while Mansfeld was sentenced to death. Because he was only 17, he would live out the rest of his short life in custody of the Soviet Secret Police. Mansfeld was held and tortured in jail until after his 18th birthday, when he was hanged. The execution was allegedly botched, and it took the young revolutionary 13 agonizing minutes to die. Péter Mansfeld became an icon of the revolution, especially the thousands of teenaged martyrs who died for Hungarian independence. This statue, and one in Veronika Park, commemorate the national hero’s sacrifice. This statue on Szabó Ilonka Street is sometimes called “Man Falling Into Death.” It depicts Mansfeld plummeting through the air in his fall at Rose Hill, twisting in fear towards his ultimate end.",teens revolution communism soviet history memorials monuments

162,Thermae Maiores,"Budapest, Hungary",Legions of Roman soldiers bathed in this ancient spa complex under a Budapest transit station.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thermae-maiores-budapest-hungary,"If you venture a short trip from the glitz of central Pest to the Flórián tér light rail station on the city’s less-visited Buda side, you’ll find an archeological gem situated just beyond the shore of the Danube, tucked under a concrete tangle of overpasses in the shadows of massive Soviet-built housing blocks. The uniquely positioned light rail station was built over, under, and through a once-bustling fortress that housed thousands of Roman soldiers in the 1st through 4th centuries. Within the camp was a sprawling complex of public baths, with some 50 rooms including a gymnasium, sweat chamber, and cold and hot water pools for the soldiers. An inscription from the year 268 refers to the complex as Thermae Maiores, or “Great Bath.” The fortress itself formed part of the ancient city of Aquincum, the capital of the Roman province of Pannonia, where it is believed that Marcus Aurelius wrote at least part of his book Meditations while on campaign in the region. The camp had two main entrances, opening up to two major roads used by the legions. The ruins of the ancient baths, which would have been some 15,000-square-meters (160,000-square-feet) big, were excavated in the 1980s and preserved for display as the Roman Baths Museum in the Óbuda district of Budapest. Given their historical significance, they are still a relatively obscure attraction, curiously located in the pedestrian underpass beneath the Flórián Square transit station. When you step off the railway, across the road you will notice a line of stone columns and thick, low walls seemingly growing right out of the grassy slope leading in to the station, a telling indication of what lies below street level. Descending the stairs from the platform it becomes obvious there is a motif to this aging station. Roman stelae and busts line the underground pedestrian passage. Continue through passage and you’ll reach a raised boardwalk and glass wall that peers into a maze of stone and terracotta structures. These scattered stone walls on the grassy slope are all that remain of twin towers that used to guard the southern wall and gate of the fortress camp. Turning a corner out of the underground passage, you can access the Roman bath complex. On the north side of the station there are overgrown remains of even more of the ancient fortress. From central Pest, take the Soviet-era Metro Line 3 to Tram 1. Flórián tér is a stop on the Tram 1 line.
The adjacent Therma Maiores is free to visit. Opening hours are 9:00 – 18:00, 1 April – 31 October. Closed Mondays. From Flórián tér, Aquincum Archaeological park is about 1 km north and the Aquincum Military Amphitheater is about 1 km to the south.",bath house roman trains hidden transportation ancient archaeology ruins
163,Bokod Floating Houses,"Oroszlány, Hungary",This Hungarian stilt village is built in a lake that never freezes over due to the power plant that that uses it as a cooling pond.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bokod-floating-houses,"The neighboring towns of Bokod and Oroszlány, about 50 miles west of Budapest, have more than two linear miles of cabins and cottages suspended on stilts over Lake Bokodi. The little houses are mostly used by locals in the summer months, but they also cater to year-round anglers who take advantage of one weird fact about the lake — despite the frigid Hungarian winters, it rarely freezes over. The 12-month liquidity is due to the power plant that dominates its skyline. As a “lake,” Bokodi-hůtőtó (its Hungarian name) is actually a cooling pond for the plant. The water is continuously circulated — cool water into the plant, warm water out — so it keeps the surface from fully freezing. If you’re looking for fish in the wintertime, not having to cut through ice is a plus. And since the houses sit directly over the water, your catch is never more than a front porch away. The lake had its 15 minutes of fame in 2014, when a moody photo of the cabins, rising out of a blue mist, was used by Bing on one of their search pages. Before Bing, few people other than the locals and dedicated fishermen were aware of the picturesque spot. It’s still off the beaten path, but it’s since been photographed more than a few times. It even played a starring role in a music video by the Hungarian contestant in the 2014 Eurovision competition. In addition to the labyrinth of cabins, boardwalks and piers, it even included a few shots of the power plant. The lake is bordered by two villages, Bokod on the west side and Oroszlány on the east. Coming from Budapest, the best option is to travel to Oroszlany and make your way from there. The best views are from this side of the lake.",power stations fishing villages lakes water

Devotees decorated the public tree by stapling pictures, flowers, letters and all manner of homemade tributes into the bark.

165,Micro Wonder Museum,"Budapest, Hungary",A collection of intricate sculptures so small they have to be seen through a microscope.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/micro-wonder-museum,"Tourists often travel abroad to see giant attractions like the Great Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, and the Eiffel Tower. But on a narrow street in Szentendre, Hungary, the most bizarre and perplexing attraction is unique for the exact opposite reason: for being incredibly small. The Micro Wonder Museum, located just 30 minutes north of central Budapest, is a grand collection of miniature art so tiny you can only see it through the lens of a microscope. The miniatures fit an immense amount of detail into just about a millimeter of space, telling a story at a scale invisible to the naked eye. Throughout the one-room museum is an array of microscopes, each with a minuscule sculpture balanced on a small object like a needle or a pin. Looking through the lenses of microscopes, you’ll see a microscopic set of golden goblets, a miniature chess set resting on the head of a pin, a tiny outline of Abraham Lincoln’s face, a golden Coca-Cola bottle, and an archer on a chariot being pulled by a horse. One of the most fascinating exhibits is a series of Ancient Egypt-themed objects squeezed inside the eye of a needle, featuring pyramids, camels, and a palm tree. The microscopic designs are the work of Mykola Syadristy, a Ukrainian artist known as the “master of miniature art,” who sculpts the objects by hand using special precision tools. His movements are so precise that he even times out his heartbeats to ensure that the pounding of his chest doesn’t alter his hand motions. The tiny sculptures are so microscopic that if you were to pick up the pin, needle, or other object that they laid on, you probably wouldn’t even notice that so much complexity and intricacy was held in the palm of your hand.  The Micro Art Museum re-opened in Budapest, right behind Gozsdu udvar, at 28, Király Street, Budapest 6th district.",miniatures museums and collections museums
166,"Mummies of Vác, Hungary","Vác, Hungary",Hungarian mummies in beautiful painted coffins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mummies-v-c-hungary,"The exhibit in Vác, Hungary is the result of a mummy bonanza discovered during routine restoration of the town’s Dominican church. In 1994 workers discovered a secret crypt that had been bricked up for over 200 years. Inside, 265 hand-painted coffins were stacked, one on top of the other, in order of size. Inside, the occupants had naturally mummified, due to perfect conditions of temperature and aridity. It wasn’t simply their bodies that were so well preserved. Everything from the rosaries to the handmade stockings on their feet were equally intact, offering a gold mine for ethnographers on the funerary customs and everyday life of 18th-century Hungarian villages. There was something there for doctors as well: traces of ancient tuberculosis. An Australian surgeon, Dr. Mark Spigelman, has devoted the past 6 years to studying the bacteria found in one mummy in particular, and the information gleaned from this ancient DNA could provide information that will help fight tuberculosis. The real delight of the mummies exhibited in Vac, Hungary isn’t the shriveled bodies and stretched skin, it is the coffins themselves. A huge selection of the coffins are exhibited, many stacked on top of each other in the same formation they had been found in. Each coffin had been lovingly hand-painted with crucifixes, flowers, quotations, bible verses, angels, skull and crossbones, hourglasses, and Memento Mori inscriptions. No coffin is a repeat of another. The variety of color, decoration, motif and even language (some in German, some Hungarian, some Latin) is simply incredible. The coffins seem to be painted with an almost joyous hand, as a celebration of the life, not a mourning of the death. One coffin, belonging to a miner, is painted with bones, skulls and a miner’s pick and shovel. Each coffin had been personalized with great thought and care. The artifacts from the church crypt are on display at the Memento Mori Museum next to the church on the square. Memento Mori can be read as a dark warning: Don’t forget that you will die. But in the art of these beautiful coffins, it can be read in a very different way. Don’t forget that you are alive.",mummies catacombs and crypts

Full of trees, chirping birds, and people jogging or walking around, it almost seems like a botanical garden or city park at first. But if you continue walking around you will start to see tombs, huge mausoleums, and old sculptures that look like they belong in a museum. Many famous Hungarian figures—from politicians to scientists to artists—are buried at Kerepesi Cemetery, which is the oldest Christian cemetery in Budapest still in use. Among the giant mausoleums are the resting place of the post-Communist leader József Antall; the revolutionary Lajos Kossuth; and other figures that played an important role in Hungary’s past. You can even see some sculptures pocked with bullet holes where the monuments were shot, and some unusual baroque tombstones decorated with skulls and crossbones. Though it’s a cemetery, Kerepesi is also one of the best green spaces in Budapest for walking and quiet contemplation.

168,Hajmaskér Barracks,"Hajmáskér, Hungary",One of the largest barracks of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy's military is now an abandoned ruin.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hajmasker-barracks,"In a country full of beautiful old castles, from a distance the pointed towers of Hajmáskér’s tallest building make it easy to mistake for a palatial palace in the middle of the Hungarian countryside. But upon closer inspection, the grim and dilapidated building begins to reveal its history as one of the largest barracks in Eastern Europe. A military settlement was established at Hajmáskér at the end of the 19th century by Franz Joseph I. Under his orders, the stately building was constructed as a barracks for artillery units who had been assigned to what would become Hungary’s largest artillery range. During World War I, the self-sustaining camp grew so large that it held a POW prison and even had its own currency. World War II saw the settlement, and the building, change hands as Nazi troops rolled in and established a base. But after the war the Soviet army moved in, remaining residents of the castle-like barracks until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990. Hajmáskér was then promptly abandoned by the soldiers, though local residents rumour that the troops stripped the building of any valuables they could find on the way out. In the 25 years since, the building has aged gracefully in some places and disintegrated in others, and the whole area exudes a silent, eerie vibe in the centre of Hajmáskér village. Visitors to the Hajmáskér barracks can sometimes hear ghosts, well, more likely the ghastly howls and whispers of local children who play amongst the decrepit and dangerous ruins.

The success of his company made him a wealthy man, enough so that he traveled the world five times over. Between 1882 and 1914, voyaging via steamers and the new transcontinental railways, Hopp collected over 4,500 objects. His collection started simply, with an ostrich egg, and evolved into the impressive collection of Asian art housed in the György Ràth Museum. Worth seeking out are the 18th and 19th century Japanese Netsuke. Small toggles which were used to attach pouches to traditional–and pocketless–kimonos, they are carved into a delightful array of shapes, from a man inspecting an egg-top to mythological creatures to sexual poses.

After that, the mine was abandoned and left to be reclaimed by nature. The industrial site was quickly grown over with dense foliage, and rainwater trickled down the mountainside to fill in the 210-foot deep gorge. Now the quarry looks like a fantasy location. The towering surrounding rock walls create a strange multi-segmented cavernous form. Walking trails along the cliffs make it a popular hiking spot, and offer lovely views of the pool below. From inside the gorge, the sky is framed by the forest fencing in the cliff paths. The Tengerszem Mine was declared a nature reserve in the 1970s. Swimming is not recommended but that doesn’t seem to stop people. The mine is beloved enough that in 2011 Tengerszem Nature Reserve was declared most beautiful place in Hungary.

This rather suggestive in form but otherwise unassuming sculpture marks the reference point from which the distances of all roads leading to Budapest are measured, as seen on highway signs throughout the country. The stylized zero rests on a four-sided base reading “KM,” surrounded by faded names and distances of Hungarian cities and towns set in the ground, radiating out from the base toward their respective locations. These all offer somewhat subtle clues about the purpose of the otherwise unexplained statue. It seems that most tourists in this heavily trafficked area are keen to sit on the benches that surround it without giving the monument so much as a passing glance. Budapest’s first kilometer-zero reference point was emblematically placed at the threshold of the royal palace, but was moved to its present location after the Chain Bridge was completed in 1849. The current sculpture was placed in 1975, adjacent to the bottom terminus of the Buda Castle Hill Funicular. Credit for the current sculpture goes to Miklós Borsos, whose work includes the tombs of some notable individuals and families located in Budapest’s Kerepesi Cemetery.

They were created after water rich with a slurry of calcium, magnesium, sulphur, and traces of other minerals pooled and solidified atop two active hot springs. In 1992, the water spouting from Salt Hill and the terraces was classified as medicinal.

Once a bustling Soviet military base, it now looks like an eerie post-apocalyptic wasteland. Szentkirályszabadja was mainly built in the 1960s to house Soviet soldiers. It functioned like a tiny town for the soldiers and their families, forming an isolated, self-sustaining community. It had many fixtures you’d expect to see in any civilian town, like schools, a movie theater, pubs, and restaurants, though most of the base was dominated by large blocks of barracks. After the Soviet Union fell in the late 1980s, many of the residents left the base. The Hungarian Defense Forces were gradually laid off, and the nearby war helicopter regiment became defunct in 2004. Now, the base’s only visitors are curious urban explorers and the occasional airsoft players, who dart and duck around the many neglected buildings. It didn’t take long for the abandoned town to begin looking like a scene from an end-of-the-world action thriller. The buildings have begun to fade and fall. Greenery creeps over the unused streets and climbs the walls of the derelict structures. Nature is reclaiming the site from civilization, slowly clutching it within its grasp. There's an unmarked road north of Szentkirályszabadja leading to the premanently open and accessible entrance of the city.

After initial excavations in a former vineyard in Hungary’s Tác municipality found a large structure that initially seemed to be a Christian basilica, the site began to offer up the remains of an entire settlement. The supposed basilica is now thought to be a palatial villa, and as archeological digs began in earnest in the 1950’s, researchers found that the building was surrounded by the remains of the entire town. Across the 200-acre property, the remaining low walls that describe the ancient city of Gorsium emerged and now show just how robust the 3rd century city was. Among the structures found were a series of shops, a number of private estates, and even the city’s attendant graveyard, fully intact. Most of the buildings are no more than short stone footprints, but a number of artful artifacts were also found such as iconic Classical columns, and some small bronze statues. Today the Gorsium Archeological Park exists as an open air museum offering visitors a chance to stroll down the ordered avenues of the ancient city and truly get a feel for a living Roman empire. The city of Gorsium was so large that excavations at the site continue to this day making sure that the reality of urban life in the Classical period is not simply remembered as half-naked statuary.",ruins museums
178,Busójárás,"Mohács, Hungary",Festival of Perpetual Life and Rebirth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/busojaras,"During February in the small Hungarian town of Mohács, the townspeople dress as horned monsters, wander the town swilling spiced wine and homemade pálinka, and make as much noise as humanly possible. Lasting for approximately one week, and ending the day before Ash Wednesday, Busójárás is a celebration and affirmation of life for the Šokci, the ethnic Croatian minority population living in Mohács. During the penultimate night of the festival, a man made of straw is carried by cart into the center of town and then burned in a bonfire while the townspeople hold hands and dance the kolo in a circle around the blaze. Busójárás has much in common with other carnival festivals that celebrate the end of winter. However, according to the official story, the roots of the festival date back to the Battle of Mohács in 1526. As legend has it, the villagers dressed up as fearsome monsters and drove away the invading Turkish army. The male busos wear a traditional sheepskin cloak, women’s wool stockings under men’s pants, and a carved monster mask. As master buso mask-maker Engelbert Antal believes, the buso’s mask isn’t to simply change his outer appearance—instead, it is to alter the person behind the mask. As such, each mask is crafted specifically for each buso. The woolen stockings are part of a carnival pagan tradition embracing the duality of male and female. Although there are now a few female busos, women who participate in the festival typically dress up in clothing reminiscent of female Ottoman Turks. During Carnival time, all rules are ignored and everything is permitted, and some claim that the excesses of the celebration were key to the small Šokci population’s survival in Mohács, as no one could question the parentage of children conceived during Busójárás. During the festival there are numerous traditional music performances, costumed folk dancing, buso parades, and in between scheduled events, general mayhem. Like every Carnival celebration, alcohol is consumed in abundance, and the busos are often very, very drunk. Visitors to Busójárás should be warned that it’s nearly impossible to witness the carnival without somehow being dragged into it. It’s common for adult spectators to have flour thrown on them, be offered drinks from large flasks of spiced wine, and to be groped and/or dry-humped (albeit for comic effect) by the busos. Admission to the festival is free, although it’s best to arrange a place to stay ahead of time. Although it is possible to stay in Mohács itself, many visitors to the festival prefer to stay in one of the pensions available to rent in the nearby wine region of Villány.

The Ministry of Agriculture Building, located along the Kossuth Lajos Square and directly across from Budapest’s iconic Parliament Building, was the backdrop for a pivotal moment in Hungary’s 1956 Revolution against Soviet control. On October 25, now known to Hungarians as Bloody Thursday, scores of spirited yet peaceful protesters congregated at the Parliament Building. To quell the mounting demonstration, Soviet troops and state secret police opened fire on the crowd of several thousand people. Some of the fleeing protesters took shelter behind the façade of the Ministry of Agriculture Building’s colonnade, and as a result, their pursuers fired in their direction, scarring the structure’s exterior in the process. It’s unclear how many died during the massacre at Kossuth Lajos Square—sources vary, citing between 22 and 1000 deaths. And despite the bloody two-week revolution, the Hungarians’ bid for autonomy was ultimately squelched by Soviet reinforcements in November of 1956.

181,Steve Jobs Memorial Statue,"Budapest, Hungary",The world’s first statue of the late Apple co-founder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/steve-jobs-memorial-statue,"When Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011, tributes poured in from across the globe. And in the days following his death, one Hungarian software company commissioned a statue in honor of the co-founder of Apple. Unveiled less than three months after his death, it became the world’s first memorial statue of Steve Jobs. The statue was unveiled on December 21, 2011, in Graphisoft Park, a science and technology park established by Graphisoft in 1997. It was commissioned by Gabor Bojar, the founder and chairman of Graphisoft, a software company that caught the eye of Jobs back in the 1980s. Bojar and Jobs first met at an information technology trade show in Germany in 1984, where Graphisoft was presenting the first version of its ArchiCAD three-dimensional design software. Jobs was impressed and agreed to support the small company, which at the time was working within the confines of communist Hungary. Apple supplied cash and computers and introduced Graphisoft to its global distribution network, forever changing the small Hungarian startup. Upon hearing the news of Jobs’ death, Bojar began thinking of an appropriate tribute. He turned to the Hungarian sculptor Erno Toth, who soon set about sculpting a life-size bronze statue of Jobs. Toth completed the statue in less than two months, and it was unveiled outside the Graphisoft headquarters. The naturalistic statue shows Jobs in his trademark attire: a long-sleeved mock turtleneck, Levi’s 501 jeans, sneakers, and round glasses. The pose, meanwhile, represents Jobs in his classic on-stage role. It shows a dynamic leader and speaker, an animated figure mid-presentation with one arm raised in a gesture of explanation and the other holding a remote control used during his presentations. Near the feet of the statue sits a simple memorial plaque inscribed with one of Jobs’ most famous quotes: “The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” And the plaque itself, fittingly, is in the shape of an iPad.  The Steve Jobs Memorial Statue is located outside the Graphisoft headquarters in Graphisoft Park, which is also home to Microsoft, SAP, Servier, Canon and more than 40 other high-tech companies in Budapest, Hungary.

In this tranquil area, casual passersby could easily be unaware of the momentous history behind the radio building. On October the 23, 1956, massive anti-Soviet protests organized by local university students rocked the Hungarian capital. What began as a peaceful demonstration turned into an all-out revolution. Throughout the day, thousands of protesters crammed themselves into Sándor Bródy Street, descending upon the Magyar Rádió Station. A group of students and their sympathizers were determined to broadcast their views over the airwaves, demanding Hungarian autonomy and an end to Soviet control. The crowd was excited and noisy, but peaceful. Conflict at the radio station had been anticipated, so members of the Hungarian secret police were already stationed there, armed with machine guns and tear gas. As tensions mounted, however, the crowd of demonstrators was ultimately fired upon by trigger-happy policemen, killing three students and injuring two as they fled. A unit of the Hungarian Army was soon called in to assist the police, but when the soldiers arrived at the radio station to see policemen attacking the unarmed protesters, many defied orders by refusing to fire upon the crowd—and instead began shooting at the secret police. With news of the shootings at the Magyar Rádió Station, other demonstrators across the city began to take up arms, raiding ammunition depots and being directly supplied with weapons by the Hungarian Army. Soon, riots began in other Hungarian cities until the whole country was embroiled in the revolt. After 12 days of fighting, Soviet reinforcements from Moscow ultimately crushed the uprising, in which an estimated 2,500 Hungarians died and an additional 20,000 were wounded. Despite the destruction wreaked upon downtown Budapest over the course of the fighting, the Magyar Rádió Building still stood when the revolution ended. The building’s façade has long since been repaired and no longer bears scars from bullets. With the exception of two small, easily overlookable plaques on the exterior of the building, no evidence remains that such a violent clash ever occurred here.

It contains a rather peculiar cemetery, where nearly all the approximately 600 grave markers are carved from dark oak in the shape of upturned boats bearing human-like faces. The roots of this centuries-old tradition are a mystery. One theory is that the boats symbolize an old belief about death being part of a journey. Another theory is that dead bodies were once floated to their burial sites on vessels which were subsequently up-ended, carved, and used as headstones. Despite the tradition’s murky history, the practice is still carried on today. Residents of the village consider the markers an important part of their culture and customs. Before a local dies, he or she picks a tree that will one day be felled to form his or her own marker. The residents also leave specific instructions with their chosen woodworker. The boat-shaped pieces of wood must meet a strict set of criteria: They must be made of oak, be between about five feet and 6.5 feet high, and face west. Some of the oldest boat markers are located in a separate area which was once reserved for Romani Hungarians and the victims of suicide. The cemetery also contains the marble tombs of the Kölcsey family, including that of Ferenc Kölcsey, a Hungarian poet and politician who wrote the country’s national anthem and died in the village in 1838.

This small statue is one of many created by “guerilla sculptor” Mihály Kolodko. He is a Ukrainian citizen with Hungarian roots, born in the city of Uzhhorod in 1978. Kolodko graduated from Lviv Academy of Arts in 2002, where he studied “monumental sculpture.” The artist began creating his miniature sculptures in 2010. They are usually not much bigger than a clenched fist, which can make them difficult to spot even when you know where to find them. But that’s part of the fun! Kolodko felt that the form allowed him to depict monumental ideas quickly and conveniently. (It also makes it much easier to sneakily install them!) Kolodko’s mini sculptures keep appearing throughout the city of Budapest. Each little sculpture has its own back story. Some are simply to entertain those that find them, others acknowledge historic people and others comment on political moments.  Once you find a statue, you can hunt down the story behind it. Beyond the Kermit in Szabadság Square, his bronze sculptures include a tiny tank at Bem Quay, a likeness of composer Franz Liszt near a bus stop, a Jeff Koons-inspired ballon dog near the Chain Bridge, and more. One of the most recent additions is a Russian warship, a commentary on the war in Ukraine that is Kolodko’s largest mini sculpture to date.

It’s a window into the traditions and history of this often-forgotten section of Northern Hungary. It’s unlikely that you will find many tourists in this region of the country. The walls of the castle were likely constructed around the 13th-century upon a rock hill elevating from the valley of the Szinva stream. The castle has a complicated history, as it was destroyed not long after construction during a Mongol invasion that left the structure in ruins. After the invasion, King Béla IV donated the castle to many of his most- favorable men. In 1364, King Louis the Great of Hungary attached a large estate to the castle, and eventually, it became known as the finest castle in the country. The castle’s design was based on Italian and French models complete with a moat, four unconquerable towers, two-story suites connecting the towers, and the largest great hall in all of medieval Central Europe. The castle was truly one of the most beautiful of its time. When Louis took the Hungarian and Polish throne, he spent some time in Diósgyőr Castle because of its proximity to the Bükk forest. The forest, now a national park, was filled with deer, bears, boar, and bison. It was the ideal hunting grounds for the king. Following the death of Louis, the castle became the residence of many queens. After the tragedy that was the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the castle began to deteriorate. Nineteenth-century paintings and photographs only show the castle in ruins, but in 1962, a restoration effort began and lasted for ten years. Today, the castle hosts various jousting tournaments and sporting events.",royalty castles history & culture architecture
191,Mátyás Fountain,"Budapest, Hungary",A triumphant marble and bronze fountain depicting a 15th-century Hungarian king and his hunting party.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/matyas-fountain,"Tucked away in the western forecourt of Buda Castle is the monumental Mátyás Fountain. The Neo-Baroque fountain shows a hunting party led by Matthias Corvinus, who was the King of Hungary. He is the bronze figure standing on top of the rocks wearing his hunting gear and holding a crossbow. A dead stag lies at his feet, which legend states was modeled after a real animal killed by poachers in 1896. Further down the fountain, a member of the king’s hunting party is blowing a horn, while another sits with his back to the public. The fountain also depicts three hunting dogs, which were sent to the sculptor by Duke Palffy as models. The fountain’s female figure is Szep Ilonka, a beautiful young woman who is said to have met the king while he was out on his hunting trip disguised as a commoner. Shefell in love with him, and when she discovered his true identity, realized her love would forever be impossible and died of a broken heart. Szep Ilonka is shown sitting to one side of the hunting group, longingly staring at the king. She is also shown protecting her tame fawn from the hunting party. The figure on the other side of the fountain is Galeotto Marzio, an Italian chronicler who accompanied the king and wrote about his life. The fountain was designed by Alajos Strobl in the Neo-Baroque style, work began on the fountain in 1899 after the approval of King Franz Joseph. It was inaugurated in 1904. The fountain is sometimes referred to as the “Trevi Fountain of Budapest” because the arrangement bears a resemblance to the Trevi layout (although on a much smaller scale).  The fountain can be found to the back of the National Gallery building, from the gallery entrance turn left and walk under the small archway.",fountains water sculptures architecture
192,Library of the Sárospatak Reformed College,"Sárospatak, Hungary",One of Hungary's most influential places of learning is also home to one of the world's most beautiful libraries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/library-of-the-sarospatak-reformed-college,"Some of the oldest and most valuable books and manuscripts in Hungarian history are housed in the beautiful library of a small university town in the Bodrog river valley. The Protestant Reformation took root quickly in Hungary, where enthusiasm for a new vision for participation in religious and intellectual life proved infectious. In the mid-to-late 1500s, several Calvinist colleges sprang up across the country, with the mission of training ministers for the new Hungarian Reform Church. Sárospatak College was one the earliest and the most notable of these institutions, hosting some of the country’s most influential thinkers. Notably, the famous Czech educator and pedagogical historian Jan Comenius spent several years here, developing his own modern vision of a college education, which included the introduction of pictorial textbooks and an emphasis on critical thinking over rote memorization. Although it existed in some form since 1531, the college’s library was scattered across several storage facilities until 1843, when it moved into its current building. The facility features high windows and an intricate, trompe l’oeil painted dome. Having exploded in size in the 20th century, it now contains over 25,000 volumes. Some of the oldest and most important pieces of the Sárospatak collection recently returned to the country after more than half a century abroad. At the dawn of World War II, 170 of the library’s treasures were transferred to Budapest for safety. They were seized by the Soviet Army on its 1945 return from Germany, and spent over half a century in the regional library of Nizhni Novgorod. In 2006, they were given back to Hungary, and are now on display at the Budapest National Museum.",schools libraries
193,Harangház Bell House,"Hajdúszoboszló, Hungary",A beautiful display of nearly 50 bells crafted with a unique design and distinct sound.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haranghaz-bell-house,"In the 1980s, a Hungarian artist Edit Oborzil and her husband Tibor Jeney filed a patent for the unique bell design they had been perfecting over the previous decades, which had a sound distinct from any others. Their bells were cast from an aluminum alloy, as opposed to the more common bronze, and contained long vertical slits along the shape of the bell, in various shapes and patterns, giving rise to a clear and harmonious chime. The innovative bell design was first displayed at an exhibition in 1983 in Austria, and the couple went to showcase it at many international events. They even designed a special one for the World Expo which was to be held in Hungary in 1996, though was later canceled. Before her death in 1996, Oborzil donated her collection of nearly 50 bells to her native town of Hajdúszoboszló, and they are now on display in a beautiful open bell house in the town’s public park. The structure’s four pillars support the multicolored glass roof display and have carvings representing the four cardinal points of the compass and the four seasons. The symbolism of the paintings in and around the structure also pertain to the Tree of Life, the legend of the White Stag, and the Spirit Bird Turul, a symbol of modern Hungary. The bells on display, which include the Kölcsey bell and the World bell cast for the cancelled Expo, ring every hour for visitors to listen to their musical chimes. The public park is located on the main road of Hajdúszoboszló, Debreceni/Szilfakalja Street. From the bus station exit onto Furdo street and enter the park (directly across the road).

In that sense Taródi Vár seems to blend in along Hungary’s border with Austria, until you realize it was actually built in the 20th century. Despite its relatively recent creation, Taródi Vár perfectly captures the medieval castle spirit. Pointed 20 meter-high turrets shoot into the air, and the dark, green forests surrounding the residence encroach mysteriously on the castle walls. Covering a massive 350 square meters, each brick was laid in place by one man and his dedicated family. In 1951, Stephen Taródi acquired a small piece of land near Sopron, Hungary and set off to build his own medieval castle. After initially beginning with wood, he soon started from scratch and laid the foundation for the castle that still stands today. Over the next 50 years, he and his family diligently worked on the castle, all the while balancing a day job. As it grew, so did its fame, and despite being the family’s home, Taródi also allowed visitors to roam through parts of his DIY castle. Although he passed away in 2010, Taródi’s castle is still available for tours today, and his family is happy open their home for visitors to wander their castle’s antique-stuffed halls.",follies and grottoes eccentric homes homes architectural oddities architecture

196,Ghetto Wall Memorial,"Budapest, Hungary","The holes in this wall provide a glimpse into Jewish life in Budapest, both past and present.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ghetto-wall-memorial,"In November 1944, the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Arrow Cross released a decree to establish a Jewish ghetto within Budapest. From December 1944 until January 1945, this area was then locked down. While the last remaining piece of the original ghetto wall was destroyed to make way for construction in 2006, this memorial is where the Budapest ghetto’s wall once stood during the darkest days of the Holocaust. During this period, 70,000 Jews were crowded into an area less than a mile squared. They were forced to occupy just over 4,000 apartments with an average occupancy of 14 people per room, while many others were forced to survive on the streets. A map carved into the concrete shows the outline of the ghetto, marking some of its most important institutions. The map has small round openings, reminiscent of bullet holes across its surface, looking through these will allow viewers to see historical scenes from the neighborhood. The memorial also has plates of rusty steel that are punched through with religious verses and a summary of Jewish life in Budapest both past and present are available in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew. It not only recalls the Holocaust but mentions the revival of Jewish life in the neighborhood. The memorial was erected by the Local Government of Budapest and the Hungarian United Israelite Community.  Nearby look down in the pavement to find one of the Stolpersteine located in the pavement.

Created by award-winning sculptor László Marton in 1972, the royal little statuette was inspired by his six-year-old daughter Évike, who would play pretend as a princess wearing a bathrobe for a cloak and a newspaper crown her father had made. When the city of Budapest commissioned Marton for a sculpture to be on public display, the image of his own little princess immediately came to his mind, a scene of undying childhood glee. The statue received a hearty welcome as soon as it was unveiled, and today it is sometimes seen as an icon of Budapest itself. The original version sculpture, which was replaced by a larger cast in 1990, now resides in the collection of the Hungarian National Gallery. In addition to this, two notable copies exist; one can be found in Marton’s hometown of Tapolca, and another, quite interestingly, stands in front of the concert hall of the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre, representing the years of friendly Hungarian-Japanese relations.",fairytales sculptures statues

Most represent the famous deeds of real people. However, lurking amid lush green lilypads and cowering in the dismal brown waters of a public garden lies a very different sculpture than others found around the city. The statue immortalizes a key scene from a century-old local novel. This little fictional fellow, Ernö Nemecsek, has two statues in the city and even a plaque to commemorate his death. The story of The Paul Street Boys by Ferenc Molnár was first published in 1906 and has become one of the most famous Hungarian novels in and outside the country. What makes András Zsigó’s ceramic sculpture particularly unique is that it is hidden in the House of Victoria’s Amazon water lily pool, where the character of little Nemecsek hid from a rival gang in the novel. The rather dark, crouching figure of the young boy looks very sad as he peers out from the water, which is fitting considering the tragic ending Nemecsek meets in the novel.  You can find the statue by peering through the hothouse windows of the House of Victoria. It is the most southerly of the round greenhouses in the ELTE Botanical Gardens. Entrance for adults is currently 1200 forints, plus 300 forints if you want to take photos. The greenhouse is currently closed, so you'll need to peer through the windows to see the statue.",literature sculptures art

A hearty hike and climb leads visitors to some of the most noteworthy, which look like the organ pipes of an instrument of monumental size, thus the name Bazaltorgonák. This unique geography, as explained by nearby educational signs, is the result of the area’s volcanism, which was especially active several million years ago, when a sea that once covered the area retreated. Flowing lava cooled into basalt rock, and over time, the forces of erosion formed the columns that draw hikers up steep trails to enjoy the view. Interesting rock formations can be found throughout the park, but these organ-like columns and an accompanying education trail are found at St. George’s Hill.  The hiking trail is roughly 4km, or 2.5 miles, and parts are steep and difficult for young children.

204,Gömböc,"Budapest, Hungary","The largest statue of this convex, homogeneous object with just one stable and one unstable equilibrium point.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gomboc,"Remember the toy Comeback Kid? Weeble? Or maybe you called it roly-poly toy? You know, that little guy who stood back up on his round bottom every time, no matter how you pushed it. That was because he had a weighted sphere (his bottom was much heavier and from a different material, therefore, he was inhomogeneous) and a very low center of mass. He actually had a stable point of equilibrium. In 1995, world-famous Russian mathematician Vladimir Igorevich Arnold proposed that a class of convex, homogeneous bodies, which, when resting on a flat surface have only one stable and only one unstable point of equilibrium, must exist. (In unstable equilibrium, the body will fall out of equilibrium no matter how you push it). A few years later in 2006, his idea was proven by Hungarian scientists, Gábor Domokos and Péter Várkonyi, by constructing a physical example. Meet Gömböc. Gömböc is basically one of the cutest superstars of mathematics. Its name comes from gömb, which means “sphere” in Hungarian. But there is actually a Hungarian folk tale about an anthropomorphic thing called Gömböc that swallows several people, then explodes in the end as it rolls down a hill because of its weight. Gömböc made quite an entrance into the scientific world. Since its discovery, scientists have examined its relationship to animals (such as the unusually-shaped Indian star tortoise), pebbles, rocks, engineering applications (drone-cages, Gömböc-shaped capsules for insulin, etc.), and even astronomy (the shape of a certain asteroid has been evaluated based on the mathematics behind Gömböc). And the list continues to grow. Gömböc also inspired award-winning movies and short films as well. Individual Gömböc models have been in production since 2007. Each model carries a unique serial number. “Gömböc 001” for example, was presented by the creators Domokos and Várkonyi and was sent to Vladimir Arnold as a gift for his 70th birthday. For all the other Gömböces, there is an official Gömböc Map for tracking their location. So in a nutshell, Gömböc is cool, Hungarians are proud of it greatly. So naturally, they made a 4.5-ton statue replica of the shape. Besides its weight, there is also one interesting fact about it: The Gömböc statue is designed in a way that its length reaches 4851 millimeters at the temperature of 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees Celsius) because of thermal expansion. This is because 4851 is the 97th extactic number, and such numbers appeared in the work of Professor Arnold on the generalization of the four-vertex Theorem, which is also closely tied to the Gömböc shape. Besides its function as a tourist attraction, the world’s largest Gömböc statue stands next to a Nokia Skypark office building in order to raise attention to the scientific activities carried out in the area.  Just walk down the Corvin Promenade, you can't miss this must-see Gömböc statue.",shapes mathematics physics art outside science sculptures

It honors the Hungarian biochemist Katalin Karikó, who, with her research on RNA, developed the basis for the mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines. The 220 square-foot mural is titled A jövőt magyarok írják (“The future will be written by Hungary”). It was painted by artists from Színes Város, and took 11 days and 197 liters of paint to complete. Katalin Karikó was born on January 17, 1955, in Szolnok, Hungary. She spent her childhood and school days in the town of Kisújszállás, where the family lived in a small house without running water, a refrigerator, or a television. By the time she reached eighth grade, Karikó was among the best biology students in the country. She completed her biology studies and doctorate at the University of Szeged, where she began to work on the synthesis of RNA. Karikó emigrated with her family to the United States in 1985. She first worked at Temple University in Philadelphia and later spent a year in Washington. Since 1989 she has worked at the University of Pennsylvania, where she met immunologist Drew Weissman, with whom she researches mRNA-based medication. Since 2013, Karikó has worked with the German company BioNTech, which, together with Pfizer, developed an mRNA-based vaccine for Covid-19.

It was made by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik and more than 350 million had been sold worldwide, making it one of the bestselling toys ever. What significantly fewer people know, is that Ernő Rubik Sr. was also an inventor, but in a slightly different field. He designed the shoulder-wing training glider known as the Rubik R-26 Góbé. First flown in 1961, the Góbé was one of the most utilized training aircraft in Hungary, one of the most famous inventions in the country. Fifteen of the aircraft were transported to Cuba, but a few also exist in the United Kingdom and Australia. The Góbé was capable of the flat-spin maneuver and beginner pilots were trained for decades on the two-seated Góbé. Naturally, when it came to the renovation of Budapest’s closest shopping mall to the airport in 2021, they decided to decorate their building with a full-size functional Góbé on the ceiling. The Góbé is so huge compared to the mall. Visitors will find very interesting technical specifications printed out next to the craft.

This memorial commemorates Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, and others who provided Jews with documents of protection and passports to enable them to escape being sent to extermination camps during World War II. This plaque is known as the Righteous Among the Nations, a title used by the State of Israel to describe the non-Jewish people who saved Jewish people from the Nazis. Along with Wallenberg, the plaque lists Carl Lutz (the Swiss Vice-consul), Angel Sanz Briz (the Spanish Ambassador in Hungary), Giorgio Perlasca (an Italian who declared himself the Spanish consul), and Angelo Rotta (an Italian prelate bishop). It is said that when Wallenberg arrived in Hungary as a Swedish diplomat, he did so with the aim of protecting as much of Budapest’s Jewish population as possible.  He led the most extensive and successful rescue attempts during the Nazi era. When the Soviet army entered Budapest in January 1945, they arrested Wallenberg for espionage and had him sent to Moscow. While the Soviet Union announced in the 1950s that he had passed away from a heart attack in 1947, many believe he was executed by the Soviets who accused him of spying for the United States. The plaque is one of several memorials in Raoul Wallenberg Holocaust Memorial Park.

Founded without any legal justification, it extended Joseph Stalin’s gulag model into the then-communist country. Some 1,500 political prisoners were imprisoned in barracks and behind barbed wire, where they performed 12 to 14 hours of backbreaking work at a nearby mine each day—all on the basis of trumped-up charges. After Stalin’s death, in 1953, Hungarian Prime Minister Imre Nagy closed this forced labor camp (together with many similar facilities), and it was demolished. The still-living prisoners were released, but during the communist era, they were forbidden to talk about the labor camp. The camp’s location was rediscovered in the 1990s, based on the reports of former prisoners, which were also used to recreate the camp buildings. One of the famous prisoners was György Faludy, a Hungarian poet, writer, and literary translator who wrote about his ordeals at Recsk in an autobiography titled My Happy Days in Hell , or Pokolbéli víg napjaim. Written in 1961-1962 in London, the novel could not be published in Hungary until 1987. Just two years later, revolution brought about the fall of communism and political change to Hungary, which allowed the site of the labor camp to be turned into a memorial whose realistic representation of the gulag’s brutality remains shocking and sobering today.

210,Matyó Museum,"Mezőkövesd, Hungary",An exploration of a small ethnic group’s heritage through their exquisite folk art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/matyo-museum,"The Matyó Museum, housed in the former Crown Hotel, offers great insight into the folk art and way of life of the Matyó people. The collection includes embroidery from different time periods, as well as home furnishings and household items. The exhibition points out how the variations of folk costumes reflect the wearer’s age and marital status. Matyó people are a small ethnic group from northern Hungary who are renowned for their exquisitely embroidered folk costumes. Although lavishly embroidered costumes suggest considerable wealth, “Matyóland” has always been among the poorest regions of the country. Their popular saying, “Let the stomach growl but the costume shine,” describes the attitude of Matyó people toward life. The folk art of Matyó living in and around the town of Mezőkövesd has a history of more than 200 years. The earliest surviving embroidery was border decoration on bedsheets that covered the so-called “high made-up beds.” These bedsheets were embroidered with motifs of shoes and birds using only red and blue yarn. The most elaborately embroidered folk costumes and household fabrics appeared in the early 20th century, and the Matyó rose has become an emblematic floral motifs. Each color used in the embroidery has a specific meaning: yellow represents summer, red represents joy, blue represents sorrow, green represents mourning, and black represents earth. Embroiderers relied greatly on the art and skill of the so-called “writing women” who created hand-drawn patterns. One of the most famous was Bori Kis Jankó (1876–1954), who was also called the “woman of 100 roses.” In addition to embroidery, these floral motifs have been used in interior design, architecture, and contemporary fashion. There are many tales circulating among women in the town about the birth of the Matyó embroidery. According to one of them, the devil once kidnapped the sweetheart of a Matyó girl. In response to the girl’s pleading, the devil asked her to bring him the most beautiful flowers of the meadow in her apron, in exchange for her lover. Unfortunately, the incident happened during winter. The girl searched in vain but found no flowers. She spent the next few days in despair, until she finally figured out how to fulfill the devil’s wish. She ran around the village and asked the women for yarn in different colors. Then, embroidering day and night, she filled her apron with beautiful flowers: roses, tulips, and peonies. She took the apron to the devil, who was pleased with the ransom and kept his promise. The painter István Takács (1901–1985) played a major role in preserving the traditions of the Matyó people with his artistic work. He was born a Matyó of Mezőkövesd, a child of a traditional peasant family.

211,Paul Street Boys Monument,"Budapest, Hungary",A scene from one of Hungary's most famous novels.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paul-street-boys-statue,"The Paul Street Boys (A Pal utcai fiuk) was a novel written by Hungarian writer Ferenc Molnar first published in 1906. It is one of the most famous novels in Hungary and is considered a classic satire of European nationalism. The novel is set in 1889 and focuses on a group of schoolboys who live in the Jozsefvaros neighborhood of Budapest. The boys spend their spare time playing on a vacant plot of land they call the “grund.” When another gang of boys attempts to take over their playground the boys are forced to defend themselves in military fashion. The novel inspired the “Little Nemecsek” statue, as well as this one on Prater utca 11. The statue shows a group of boys playing marbles with two other boys watching them menacingly, it depicts the “einstand,” a bullying scene from the novel. The location might seem a little obscure, however, it’s the location of the school that the boys attended in the novel. Looking closely, there are several fun little details that bring the sculpture to life, such as the discarded book bag and the coat hung on a nail in the wall. The sculpture was created in 2007 by Peter Szanyi.",literature statues history & culture
