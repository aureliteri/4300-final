0,KGB Museum,"Tallinn, Estonia","""There's nothing there,"" and other lies the KGB told us.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kgb-museum,"After the Soviets built Tallinn’s luxurious, but imposing, Hotel Viru in the 1970s, Estonians joked that the building was made of microconcrete, as in concrete and microphones. Few people were ever allowed on the hotel’s top floor, which the Soviet managers insisted contained only technical rooms. When the KGB fled the country in the early 1990s, the newly liberated Estonians discovered that the technical rooms housed elaborate, vintage James Bond-esque listening equipment. The hotel’s new owners kept the rooms exactly as the KGB left them. On the door of those technical rooms is now written “There’s nothing here” in both English and Estonian, which alludes to the official answer given when anyone asked what was behind the door. Visitors can take guided tours that focus not only on the more absurd elements of living in a surveillance state, but on the strange history of the hotel, which includes sex work, espionage, and some of the best chicken to be had during the occupation.  The museum itself is located on the top floor of Hotel Viru, but you may only access it via guided tours which begin in the hotel lobby.",secret museums secret crime crime and punishment collections museums and collections museums
1,Rummu Underwater Prison,"Rummu, Estonia",The ruins of an Estonian prison are drowning in the quarry lake where the convicts were once forced to work.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rummu-underwater-prison,"It’s unlikely that those interred in this Soviet prison ever imagined that the quarry they were forced to work in would someday become a beautiful diving spot. But it’s a weird world, and time is long. The ruins of the abandoned prison camp outside the small Estonian town of Rummu were once a dreaded stone edifice, but are now a beach attraction. The prison was already established in the 1940s by the Soviet Union. It was built in a convenient location, on the lip of a limestone quarry in which the inmates were forced to toil. The seemingly impenetrable walls of the prison were not to last forever. When Estonia regained its independence in 1991, the Soviets moved out and many of their institutions fell, including the labor prison at Rummu. Both the prison and the quarry were abandoned in the changeover. Without anyone to look after the natural groundwater that seeped into the former quarry, it soon filled up with water, creating a new lake with alarming speed. It filled up so fast that many of the mining machines and even some of the buildings were swallowed whole by the rising waters. Today, some of the former prison can still be seen on land, as parts of the structure stick out from the crystal clear lake waters. The spot has become a prime location for divers and adventurous beachgoers who come for the sunken ruins beneath the waves.  The Rummu Prison is now open during summer as an adventure center with an entrance fee of 3€. Different activities such as snorkeling, paddleboarding, and canoeing to name a few.",underground week jails underwater prisons water ruins
2,Kaali Meteorite Crater Field,"Kaali, Estonia",Mysterious craters may have been home to an ancient cult.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaali-meteorite-crater-field,"Kaali, on the Estonian island of Saaremaa, is the site of the last giant meteorite impact to occur in a densely populated region. The landscape that the collision left in its aftermath has been the subject of many mythological tales and may have been home to a mysterious ancient cult. About 7,500 years ago, a huge rock from space came hurtling toward the Earth. Several kilometers above the Earth’s surface, the meteorite broke into pieces from the pressure and heat of the atmosphere. The resulting chunks collided into Saaremaa with the force of a small nuclear bomb, wreaking havoc on the landscape and possibly claiming numerous victims. The explosion left nine total craters, now known as the Kaali Meteorite Crater Field. Some of these craters are quite small: one measures only twelve meters across and one meter deep. But the most interesting of the group is the largest crater, a gently sloping bowl filled with stagnant, murky water. Simply known as Kaali crater, the largest crater (which measures 110 meters across) is believed to have been a sacred site for many centuries, in part due to its cosmic origin. Surrounding Kaali crater are the remains of an immense stone wall from the Late Bronze Age, stronger than any similar structures in the region and providing clues to the crater’s use by ancient peoples. Archaeologists believe it is possible that the wall served as a stronghold for an ancient cult settlement. As evidenced by the unusually large quantity of animal bones found within the wall’s borders, the Kaali crater lake was not only a watering place but also a place of sacrifice. While it is known that Estonians have made live offerings in the past (for good harvests and other reasons), one curious aspect of the site’s animal remains is that some date back only to the 1600s, long after the Church forbade such rituals. Some even believe that ancient offerings still remain undiscovered at the bottom of the six-meter-deep Kaali lake. However, deposits of oak trees in the water have prevented scientists from probing beyond four meters below the surface. Whatever the case may be, Kaali is a site of indisputable importance, historically and scientifically speaking. The experience doesn’t end at the crater field. There is even a Kaali Meteor Museum and Hotel—in case you want to stay for another day among ancient cult ruins and the evidence of terrifying destruction. Kaali Visitor Centre is in Kaali meteorite field. It is about 3 km from Kuivastu on the Kuressaare road 18 km from Kuressaare and 62 km from Kuivastu.

3,Linnahall,"Tallinn, Estonia",An empty relic of the Moscow Olympics crumbles away in Estonia's capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/linnahall,"When Moscow hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics, the sailing events were held in Soviet-occupied Estonia. Linnahall, originally called the “V. I. Lenin Palace of Culture and Sport,” is a sprawling ziggurat-like complex designed to host the Olympic regatta. Today, it’s all but abandoned, and mostly visited by graffiti artists and curious tourists. The structure was commissioned by the Soviet Union in part to show the world their mastery over concrete-pouring. In addition to its massive 5,000 seat amphitheater, it includes an ice hall, a small seaport, and a heliport. The ice hall closed in 2009, and the concert hall in 2010. The hurried construction of the building has begun to show over the past 30 years as the poorly finished rock crumbles. The arena is still used from time to time when a large enough event comes to the country, but generally, the huge structure sits empty. Locals and tourists still enjoy taking the external steps up to the roof of the hall, which provides a rather stunning view of Tallinn’s skyline. As many important buildings in the Soviet Union, the design of Linnahall was planned to be also useful during wartime. The location by the sea and the flat roofs made it a perfect spot for tanks or cannons to cover the whole bay of Tallinn, in case the “evil” Finns would want to conquer the city. In 2019 the City of Tallinn announced plans to transform the structure into a conference center, including an opera and concert hall.  As of 2019, most of the structure is blocked off by safety fences. The rooftop, with its magnificent view, is the only part of the building that can be visited.",abandoned architectural oddities architecture
4,Ichthus Art Gallery,"Tallinn, Estonia",A secluded art gallery hidden within the cellars beneath Tallinn’s medieval monastery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ichthus-art-gallery,"When wandering around Tallinn, Estonia, you’re bound to find little alcoves, tiny courtyards, and winding streets that make you feel as though you’ve stepped back in time. Saint Catherine’s Dominican Monastery, one of the oldest buildings in the city, is one such place. But upon closer inspection, it becomes evident there are two things for visitors to explore at the medieval site, not just one. You can choose to go up the stairs to the left and enter the main part of the monastery where the monks lived. Or, you can decide to head to the right where an open iron gate and wooden doors lead to a steep staircase that, despite descending into a deep gloom, somehow still looks promising. At the bottom of this staircase, beneath the interior courtyard, you can find a display with an old book of photos and writing that offers a tidbit of the history of the Dominican monks. The room opens into a series of connected cellars where monks worked from 1246 to 1524. There’s an enormous fireplace in one part, and if you follow the narrow hallways back deeper into the rooms, you’ll discover a small, blocked off stairway (maybe a shortcut?) up to the surface. There is also a nice sitting area under an alcove. These ancient underground rooms hold original works of art for sale by the the man who currently rents the space, an artist named Aleksandr Savchenkov. The artist is usually in the small gallery, called Ichthus Art Gallery, constructing new pieces while the occasional visitor mills about among the watercolor paintings and Savchenkov’s for-sale work, to a muted soundtrack of Latin chants playing from a discreet CD player.  There is a donation box underneath the map of the monastery. They request a donation but no amount is set.",gallery monks books medieval art history
5,Pähni Megaphones,"Varstu Parish, Estonia",A trio of giant wooden megaphones turn up nature's volume in this Estonian forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pahni-megaphones,"Anyone who is sick and tired of the peace and quiet afforded by the solitude of nature should head over to Estonia’s Võru county forest and take a listen through the giant wooden microphones found in their clearing. These wooden tubes were installed in a clearing deep within the Estonian forest by a group of interior architecture students. Since the region is known for its natural beauty, they decided to create the over-sized amplifiers to enhance the sounds of the waving trees and birds singing. The project was named RUUP. Installed far from any homes or other signs of civilization, the cones have nothing to pick up but the natural sounds emanating from the flora and fauna all around. In addition to pumping up the scenic volume, the megaphones are large enough to climb inside and sit or lay down. In fact when the project was finally complete, musicians came and played music while seated right in the funnels. It is pretty hard to improve on nature, but increasing the decibels seems to be pretty effective. Each of the three megaphones is even placed so that were you to stand in the middle of their directional cones, it could in theory have a 3D effect on the sounds. In reality it is really difficult to tell as the forest overwhelms you.",sounds natural wonders nature art
6,Tuhala Witch's Well,"Kose Parish, Estonia","This disappearing geyser has been attributed to witchcraft, but really it's all about rainfall.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuhala-witchs-well,"Located in the tiny village of Tuhala, the Witch’s Well is a naturally occurring geyser that has been known to flood the entire area after heavy rains. Clearly the work of witches. The Witch’s Well is actually an example of what is known as a “karst spring.” The opening from which the spring issues is located over an underground river, which is normally located far enough underground that it isn’t a problem. But after extremely heavy rains, the river tends to swell up and issue forth from the well, completely flooding the surrounding area. The geyser effect can last for days, making for a major disaster for those effected by the flooding. In olden times, this pandemonium was not seen as simply an unfortunate natural occurence, but was instead blamed on those perennial villains, witches. According to the local lore, witches would gather down in the well and lash each other with branches. This pagan reverie was thought to cause the catastrophic flooding that came periodically came from the well. Unfortunately, it was just nature. The well does not flood each time it rains, but just occasionally. It is often years between each flooding, so when it occurs, people now come from all around to check it out. A wooden cap has been placed over the natural hole, so even though it can be damaging, the Witch’s Well certainly looks like it has caged a witch inside of its depths.",wells witches water
7,Seaplane Harbour,"Tallinn, Estonia",Disused seaplane hangar gets a second life as the jaw-dropping home of Estonia's museum of maritime history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seaplane-harbour,"Completed in 1917 as part of Peter the Great’s naval fortress, the Tallinn seaplane hangars were unique in their day for both their size and technology. The building was among the first reinforced concrete shell structures realized at such an enormous magnitude, measuring in at a whopping 39-by-109 meters. Only over the course of the next decade or so would analogous structures begin to crop up in rest of the world, particularly during the aviation boom of the 1930s. Back in Estonia, the 1920s and 1930s found the Seaplane Harbor serving as a holiday resort for the Estonian air force unit, providing an athletics hall as well as a tennis court under the hangars. After the Second World War, the hangars were taken over by the Soviet Army. They lost their importance, were neglected and mainly used as warehouses and wood shops. When Soviet forces left and their assets were taken over by the Estonian government, the hangars were at the center of judicial dispute for a decade. Throughout this time, the building went unmaintained, and the general public was left wondering what was going on inside. Only in 2006 did the government obtain ownership of the property again, at which point it invested in the renovations and restoration necessary to save the building from further decay. Currently the former hangars have been repurposed as the jaw-dropping home of the Estonian Maritime Museum’s collection. The museum’s exhibit includes the oldest shipwrecks found in Estonia, an explorable submarine called “Lembit” and a full size replica of a British seaplane, as well as a myriad of other related historic paraphernalia unique to the region. The real star here, though, is the old seaplane hangar itself; sound and light design create a surreal effect of feeling as if one is underwater, with waves lapping at the ceiling. Periodically a light show of planes traverses the big concrete domes.  Seaplane Harbour17 Küti Street / 6 Vesilennuki Street10415 Tallinn, Estonia",aviation museums and collections museums
8,Ungru Manor,"Ridala Parish, Estonia",The gutted remains of this Estonian mansion are a monument to a tragic love.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ungru-manor,"While it’s hard to see this in its current, dilapidated state, but at one point, Ungru Manor was the finest neo-baroque mansion in all of Estonia. But after it was stripped of materials to help build a nearby runway it is is simply a rotting husk, surrounded by a sad love story that never happened. Created as a near-perfect copy of Merseburg Castle in Halle, Germany, the manor that remains today was built in the 1890s on the site of a manor that had been there since the 1500s. As the story goes, the son of Ungru’s owner visited Merseberg Castle and fell in love with the princess there. He proposed, but the princess was so fond of her father’s castle, she claimed that she was going to stay there forever, so the son returned home and vowed to recreate the German castle for her. He went back to Estonia and began construction, building out most of the structure including most of the exterior and its 11 gables. However before the interior could be finished, word came that the princess had died. The son himself died not long after in 1908. The house was left incomplete and without an owner. The tragic monument sat empty and was slowly pillaged for valuables and materials by local scavengers. During Soviet rule of Estonia, an airfield for fighter jets was constructed nearby and the builders used the mansion as a source of raw materials. Today, the airfield is equally abandoned. Luckily, what remains of the estate is now protected from further destruction, so the site is not completely lost to history. The gutted remains are visible from a nearby highway and interested explorers can still visit them should the tragic origin fail to break their heart and cancel the trip.",eccentric homes castles homes abandoned ruins

Though it’s about a 15 minute walk from the historic Old Town, it’s worth the slight detour to wander through and see what the thriving artistic community has to offer. The creative city, which consists of 10 buildings that hold over 200 businesses and organizations, has an easygoing bohemian vibe. Each individual business is at liberty to design its space as it sees fit. The eclectic array of mismatched décor creates a vibrant, artistic atmosphere. You don’t have to go to Telliskivi to do something particular—it’s a lovely spot just to kill some free time. It’s a perfect place for hanging out and meeting locals. There are many restaurants, cafes, and shops for different budgets and tastes. There’s also a yoga studio, a concert hall, and even a massage studio. It’s also the place where many events are held. On Saturdays, Telliskivi hosts the biggest flea market in Tallinn, where you can spend hours browsing through selections of artwork, antiques, and oddities. There’s also a massive annual food festival that draws in thousands of people. Telliskivi allowed Tallinn’s artists and free spirits to reclaim a neglected part of their city.

10,Piusa Sand Caves,"Piusa, Estonia",Man-made mineral caves house massive bat colony.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/piusa-sand-caves,"Just beneath the ground in the Piusa Sand Caves, is a massive group of hibernating bats. Having made their home in the man-made passages since the 1950s, the size of this protected bat house has swelled to become the largest bat colony in all of the Baltic States. Beginning in 1922, miners began to hollow out the area that is now the Piusa Caves. Excavating for glass-sand, miners carefully hollowed out the sandstone into long corridors, open galleries and surprisingly elegant vaulted ceilings. Starkly different from other mines that are blasted apart or simply hacked to death, the Piusa Caves almost seem like a planned underground development. Whether the bats thought so or not, they moved in, and have been protected in the caves since 1958. By 1970, mining had tapered off completely, and the caves are now only known for their bats. Counted at a remarkable 3000 bats in 1999, five different species of bats have flourished in the underground world, causing many scientists to come to Estonia to study them. Although the caves can be explored, visitors are warned to stay on marked paths only to avoid injury in the delicate caves, and to not stir up the flying mammals.

The next morning, the Peeping Tom was found pale and gray-haired. The last thing he managed to say before dying was that he saw the Devil getting married.

Neighboring a number of countries (Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Russia), the city of Tallinn has had a historic need for fortification. The Kiek in de Kök was built in 1475 to defend the city from invaders and the 16th century cannonballs still embedded in the outer walls show that it did its job admirably. As the centuries churned on, the simple tower was expanded and a series of tunnels was added to the fortification in the 17th century. The bastion tunnels were originally intended to shelter men, ammunition, and supplies, and were also used as an observation post to spy enemies. However they were never put to use in the era of their building since Tallinn was hit with a plague that effectively removed them from the wars of the time. Having missed their original calling, the tunnels were then used to house prisoners for a time. After the World War I the tunnels were again adapted to be used as air-raid shelters saving a number of lives when Tallinn was bombed during World War II. During the Cold War the tunnels were equipped with independent electricity, ventilation, water, and phone connections, preparing to shelter the noble elite in case of a nuclear strike. Luckily the bomb was never dropped and the tunnels were once again without a purpose, so they were put to use as a store room to house sculptures from the National Art Foundation. After couple of years the sculptures were moved elsewhere in the fear of art thieves finding a way into the wide network of passages. Once the art was removed the tunnels were left empty and soon slipped into disrepair. Since that the tunnels were empty. Soon the abandoned passages were being used by punks and rebels to hide from the police who avoided the tunnels because of heavy rat and flea infestations. The corridors also became home to a number of displaced people seeking shelter. In 2005 the Kiek in de Kök was finally turned into a museum and the tunnels were cleaned of both humans and vermin so that they could be opened to the public. Today the tower and its tunnels display exhibitions on the history of Tallinn and the tower as well as contemporary art. Time will tell how long the tunnels can keep just one purpose.  The tunnels can be visited by previous appointment only. Entry is free with the Tallinn Card and a ticket covers the museums in the towers joined by a section of the curtain wall.",wwi cold war tunnels towers military history subterranean sites world war ii military
13,Kingdom of Torgu,"Laadla, Estonia",A clerical error gave rise to this imaginary micronation in the southwestern corner of Estonia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kingdom-of-torgu,"The so-called Kingdom of Torgu was formed back in 1992, soon after the Republic of Estonia gained independence from the Soviet Union. At the time, the Sõrve peninsula on the island of Saaremaa was divided into two municipalities, Salme and Torgu parish. But while the new constitution of Estonia was being formed, civil servants simply forgot to count in the Torgu parish at all. Thanks to this human error, this 48.8-square-mile area was technically not governed by the constitution. The 500-odd people who lived in the area were surprised by this negligence, but soon decided to take advantage of the mistake. They came up with the idea of starting their own country, and calling it a kingdom. The throne was offered to a journalist and political activist named Kirill Teiter, who accepted it and became the first (and only) monarch to reign over the newly formed Kingdom of Torgu. The kingdom has its own flag, a coat of arms with a “snail-dragon” as the emblematic animal, and its own currency in coins, the “kirill,” with the worth of 1 kirill fixed to the price of a half-liter of local vodka. When a new law was passed in 1993, the Torgu area was once again officially counted into the constitution, but the locals had grown fond of being in their own kingdom and continued to go along with it nonetheless. In 2017, all the municipalities on the island were merged into one, but the spirit of the kingdom still lives in the hearts of the local residents. You can see the Torgu flags waving and the coat of arms presented here and there throughout the former parish. The border marks delineating Torgu’s boundaries are used in commemorative days and anniversaries only, but if you head to the far end of Sõrve peninsula, you will definitely be inside the borders of the kingdom.  The map location points to a local shop where you can find some of the royal regalia like postcards and stamps. This region has some other well-known sights inside the borders of the kingdom: The Sõrve Military Museum, Stebel Military Defence Battery, and Sõrve Lighthouse are the most well-known places to visit.",mistakes micro-nations government soviet history
14,Glehn Park,"Tallinn, Estonia",A forest park outside Tallinn full of architectural and artistic curiosities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glehn-park,"Located on the outskirts of Tallinn, Glehn Park was developed by an eccentric landowner named Nikolai von Glehn. He designed and built himself a castle on the grounds, which was completed in 1886. At the time it must have been a real treasure of art brut, decorated with eclectic reliefs and a mix of Latin, Greek, French, Russian, and German texts. Glehn also designed his own furniture, chairs, and tables with carved figurines as decorations. Unfortunately, the whole place was looted during World War I and nothing of the original interior is left. (The building now belongs to a local university and is used for receptions and events.) Another architectural gem on the grounds is the palm house that stood opposite the castle. It is a half-underground, multiple-story building with a mosaic roof covered with colorful glass panels. It is in ruins today, but it still amazes with its Gaudi-esque style. A little ways further out in the forest you’ll also find a small observatory tower. Still, the most curious aspect of this park may be the sculptures. The most notable of them is a sculpture of a strange horned man. It is often considered to be the Devil, but actually, it is meant to represent a mythical hero of Estonian folklore, named Kalevipoeg. The Kalevipoeg sculpture is about 33 feet (10 meters) tall and was modeled on the measurements of Glehn himself, upsized four times. The original sculpture was also destroyed during the war, because Russian troops were afraid that the horns were actually a secret transmitter device signaling information to German ships. A restored replica now stands next to the debris of the original. Behind the Kalevipoeg is a sculpture of a crocodile. The pair together was meant to symbolize a beast lurking behind a hero.

The original painting is thought to have been almost 100 feet long and included about 50 figures. Look at the artwork, and you’ll see a preacher in the pulpit introducing the dance, followed by Death playing the bagpipes and Death carrying the coffin. After that are Pope, Emperor, Empress, Cardinal, and King, each led by a figure of Death. A dialogue between Death and other characters is presented as a band of text below the figures. The Danse Macabre, or Dance of Death, was a common theme in medieval art. It depicts the universality of death and challenges viewers to contemplate the transience of life. The morbid artwork was particularly prominent during the Black Death that devastated Europe in the 14th century. Artworks of this genre stress equality in the face of death. Though people are lined up according to their social status—the wealthy toward the front, the poor toward the back—they all dance with the same skeletal figures. The first known mention of Tallinn Dance of Death painting goes back to 1603. It is attributed to Bernt Notke, one of the best-known artists in Northern Europe during the Late Middle Ages. It’s recorded that such a painting was commissioned in the late 15th century from the workshop of Notke, though the commissioner is unknown. It is also not known who paid for the painting in Tallinn and where it was initially located. In the mid-17th century, the artwork was located in the chapel of St Anthony of St Nicholas’ Church. Notke painted work on the same topic for St Mary’s Church in Lübeck, but this was destroyed in 1942.  The painting is displayed in St. Nicholas' Church, which contains the Niguliste Museum, a branch of the Art Museum of Estonia. The museum charges an entrance fee. Danse Macabre is the main attraction, and is prominently displayed.",dance of death skeletons paintings death medieval art
17,Kiipsaare Lighthouse,"Saaremaa, Estonia","Once standing on solid ground, this slender beacon is a victim of the very shoreline it was charged with announcing.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kiipsaare-lighthouse,"The slender beacon off the coast of the Estonian island of Saaremaa casually leans to one side, continually beaten by the waves of the Baltic Sea. When the lighthouse was built, in 1933, it stood on solid ground, more than 80 feet (25 meters) in from the coast. But over the course of the later 20th century, as erosion took its toll, the tower was set out to sea. The concrete structure has kept moving farther into the sea (or, rather, the sea has kept chomping away at the shoreline), with the waves and currents causing its famous Pisa-like tilt. At its worst it slumped 15 degrees out of plumb, but as those same waves and currents have shifted again, the underlying foundation has straightened up significantly. Still, from a certain angle it looks like the whole thing will topple over. Standing 82 feet tall, the history of the Kiipsaare leaning lighthouse goes back further than its construction. A station has been on this spot since 1879, guiding ships through the dangerous and shifting shores of Estonia. Over the course of the 80-plus years since this one was built, the lonely lighthouse has become a victim of the very coastline it was charged with announcing. Today, it is surrounded by water, and has been inactive since 1992. It’s not clear what is ultimately in store for the Kiipsaare lighthouse. The options are as wide open as the Baltic Sea. The lighthouse is off the northwest coast of Estonia's Saaremaa island, and you will need your own transportation to visit. It is located in the Vilsandi National Park nature reserve. You can leave the car in the parking area and walk the trail for the last 3 miles (5 km) to the beach. Be prepared for an hour hike (one way). Officially the lighthouse is closed, but the outside door is long gone and if you are able to heave yourself up, you can take the stairs all the way to the top.",flooded towers lighthouses oceans towers islands abandoned

Though it may look like a junkyard where old vehicles go to rot, it’s actually a fascinating collection of Soviet-era machinery. The battered cars and trucks all seem to wear their rust stains with a sort of stoic pride. And that’s exactly the point of the place. The open field exhibition is a site where discarded vehicles are collected in their unrestored state. The museum compiles all kinds of vehicles—passenger cars, buses, trucks, trams, tractors, motorbikes, fire trucks, you name it—that originated from parts of the former Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. The entire collection aims to preserve these metal pieces of the past, as its main goal is to preserve the cars that traveled the roads of Estonia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Wandering among the vehicles is a unique chance to imagine how the roads there would have looked during the Cold War. There are hundreds of cars and trucks on display, and you can even find Moskvitch, Lada, GAZ trucks, and Ikarus buses.

19,Sillamäe,"Sillamäe, Estonia","This Soviet-era ""closed town"" was a top secret uranium producer often left off of maps.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sillamae,"The small Estonian town of Sillamäe is, today, easy to track down and even features in tourism guides. But during the Soviet era, it was a secret town, rarely depicted on maps and only referred to using codes like Moscow 500 and Leningrad 1. In the 19th century it was a small resort town that celebrities of the time visited, mostly from Russia, including Tchaikovsky and Pavlov. But right after World War II the town changed forever. Due to the building of a uranium enrichment plant in the region, it became off-limits to anyone other than those directly linked to its operations. Constructed in the 1940s through the efforts of several thousand prisoners, the secret town was home to around 3,000 residents. Since it was a “closed town” with little contact to the outside world, the government took special measures to make it a habitable and interesting place for engineers working at the factory. Even the architecture of Sillamäe is different than typical Soviet style; the buildings were built in the style of Stalinist neoclassicism. The main example is the town hall building that looks just like a church but has never served as one. In the beginning, the uranium was mined locally, but was later imported from other parts of Europe. In the five decades of its functioning, the plant in Sillamäe refined over 100,000 tons of uranium, which was in turn used in 70,000 nuclear weapons, including the Soviet Union’s very first nuclear bomb. This extended period of radioactivity did not leave the landscape unharmed and even before the fall of the Soviet Union, the operations were winding down at the plant. After the collapse, it was liberated along with the rest of Estonia, and the factory was adapted to process rare metals and particles. Sillamäe remains a enclave where ethnic Russians are a majority, the street names are often in Russian, and the Communist symbols like sickles, hammers, and stars can be see woven into the decor of buildings—a reminder of the Soviet Union’s once expansive power and influence in the region. The coordinates lead to Sillamäe's Town Hall.

According to the earliest records available, it had already had its third owner by 1422, meaning it had opened years prior. Back in the Middle Ages, the pharmacy sold a wide variety of medicine and potions. Its offerings included mummy juice, burnt bees, earthworms, snakeskin, and even unicorn horn powder, not to mention sundry kinds of herbs and alcohol. Townsfolk came to Raeapteek not only to buy medicine, but also to seek out treatment advice and spiritual assistance. It was also where people gathered to chat over a cup of tea or a glass of claret, hearing news and passing them on to others, similar to today’s cafés. It is reported that important meetings of the town were often held here, too. Many other goods became available in later years, such as candy, marzipan, tobacco, ink, playing cards, gunpowder, salt, and spices. A Hungarian immigrant named Johann Burchart took over the pharmacy in 1582. Over 10 generations of his family ran the business until 1911. By the early 18th century, the family’s fame grew so great that Tsar Peter the Great is said to have called for Johann Burchart V to attend to him on his deathbed—though he passed before Burchart made it to the Russian capital. Today, the Raeapteek sells modern medicine on its first floor, as well as claret and marzipan, while running a small museum of historical medical instruments and other curiosities.  The pharmacy is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., every day except Sundays.",pharmacy museums medical museums medicine shops

Located atop a small Estonian hill on the border of the parishes of Reigi and Puhalepa, the this cross garden has hundreds and hundreds of small, simple hand-made crosses scattered around a forested area. According to the informational sign on the site, the crosses began appearing on the hill as a memorial to a group of Swedes living on the island of Hiiumaa, who were forced to relocate to Ukraine in the late 1700s. Although this is not the only version of the cross history. Another tale says that a pair of rival wedding parties bumped into each other on this trail, and a fight broke out when neither would make way for the other. One side lost their bride, and the other lost their groom, so the remaining singles married each other. Thus the legend was born that not only will planting a cross on the site bring good luck, but it can also inspire a lasting partnership. Visitors are welcome to add their own crosses when they visit the hill. The cross should be made out of natural material one can find nearby without harming the vegetation. People usually tie together two small tree branches using bark or hay and leave the cross to lie around in the forest. Although these crosses may not last for very long there is no need to fear that the hill will run empty, because the next visitors will simply add their own crosses to this ever growing mass of memorial twigs and sticks.

At its start, it looks like a great rocky road to the horizon. The stone wall, which was built between 1863 and 1864, sits atop the remains of a 17th-century seawall. The original wall was constructed under the orders of Catherine the Great of Russia, who inherited control of the southern Estonian town after the Russians conquered Pärnu from the Swedish in 1710. Remnants of the old Russian seawall become visible at low tide beneath the wobbly rocks. The current seawall also has a couple of legends at its foundation. According to one tale, the jetty was built because an elderly townsman wanted to head toward the horizon to be closer to the Moon and stars. A more popular bit of local lore says that if a couple holds hands while journeying along the wall and kisses at its endpoint, they’ll remain together forever. Hopping from rock to rock on the jetty is a challenging but rewarding experience, whether you do so while holding hands with a lover or not. A red-and-white channel marker pinpoints the end of the pier, about the size of a full grown adult, to prevent any night-time boating accidents. You’ll likely find locals enjoying a small picnic at the end, greeting passing boats and enjoying their tasty treats while the waves lap soothingly against the stones. Before striding out across the stones, be sure to check the water levels! At high tide the wall is completely submerged, and it can be dangerously slippery in the rain.",love walls legends

While the church building itself only dates back to the 17th century, the church on the site was founded centuries earlier, and the tradition of burying important figures on the grounds was practiced nearly the whole time. From nobles to church figures, the grounds were the final resting place of a number of high-ranking society members of the time. To honor their burial, intricate wooden coats-of-arms known as “epitaphs” would be hung inside the church almost like a remote headstone. However by the 18th century church burials were outlawed and the practice of creating the lovely grave badges was discontinued until around the 1800s when it came roaring back with a vengeance. A number of epitaphs were carved to honor knights and nobles. While the tradition is no longer in active practice today, the legacy of the ornate memorials lives on at the Cathedral of Saint Mary which still houses 109 of the epitaphs on its walls. Most of the epitaphs date back to the 17th and 18th century and are made as tall as 12 feet. While they have been restored and preserved over the years, some of the paint is fading and the edges are chipping, however the epitaphs don’t seem to have lost any of their extraordinary regal flair.

Between 1940 and 1954, during the first Soviet occupation of the country, the KGB operated against the Estonian people right in their own backyard. Citizens suspected (or simply conveniently accused of) political subversiveness would be disappeared to Siberian gulags, but not before passing through Tartu’s “Grey House.” While the upper floors of the bleak edifice were used as office for the secret police, the cellar of the house was used as a clandestine holding dungeon. The exterior appearance of the house was kept deliberately ordinary as not to create any suspicion. From the front, the building gave no indication of its sinister purpose, but the backside of the house had cellar windows protected with metal bars. Summary executions would also take place at the Grey House, ensuring that some poor Estonians did not even get the chance to suffer through the Soviet gulag system. There were 13 prison cells and three smaller solitary rooms where unfortunate political prisoners would be interrogated and judged. The Grey House was returned to its original owners in 1991, and the basement cells were opened as a museum and memorial in 2001. Today, the rooms have been restored to the original conditions under which detainees suffered. Some cells display exposition regarding the Estonian resistance to the Soviet regime, giving information about the deportations and prison camps, as well as the secret societies and so-called “forest brothers” who acted against the Soviet power. Thousands of doomed Estonians passed through these cells, but today they are a powerful reminder of the brave men and women that fought to take back their country.",secret prisons soviet history hidden world war ii military

It’s remarkable in many respects. Its walls contain a trove of archived pieces of the past, strung together in a web of storytelling and written records, but the historic records are just one piece of Noora’s appeal. The building’s exterior is the first thing to grab people’s attention. Its front side is covered with a textile showing a groove motif, which both mimics the human brain and represents the twists, turns, and triumphs one encounters while exploring. The black and white canvas is so big it wraps around the structure’s sides. Look closely, and you’ll see the labyrinth has two openings and can actually be solved. Step inside Noora, and you’ll find yet another maze. While walking through a permanent exhibition called Twists and Turns, you can learn about Estonia’s history during its pivotal early years, which spanned from 1917 to 1920. The labyrinth tells the story of the birth of the Estonian state, woven together with parallel events in world history to form an intertwined, international tale. The archive bills itself as the home of Estonian written memory. Noora contains millions of documents, one so old it dates back to 1240. It’s packed with treasures like church books, court documents, and royal records. Noora holds yet another piece of experiential art. A unique audio device called The Lilt is integrated into the building and creates sounds based on the building itself and the movement of the people inside, which are used as activating impulses that initiate musical rhythms from a chord matrix. As people mill about, it gives the piece an unpredictable and labyrinthine nature. It’s as if the archive itself is symbolically giving its own version of history by recording the daily happenings within the building.

30,Saatse Boot,Estonia,This peculiar border irregularity is the only way to legally enter Russia without a visa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saatse-boot,"To enter Russian territory, travelers typically need to show a valid passport, fill out various forms, and carry a Russian migration card from place to place. But there is just one piece of Russian territory where this rule is violated and it is technically possible enter the country without completing a single piece of paperwork. Welcome to the Saatse Boot. In 1944 in the former Soviet Union, a new border line was drawn between Estonia and Russia. In this new border, a half mile wide Russian peninsula jutted into Estonian land, lying directly in between the Estonian towns of Lutepää and Sesniki. Since both Estonia and Russia were united under the Soviet Union at the time, there was no issue with building a road directly through Russian territory to link the towns together. But, when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 and its lax interregional borders were made strict, this 900-meter stretch of road suddenly became a geopolitical anomaly known as the Saatse Boot. Thinking on its feet, Russia decided to allow passersby to cross through the Saatse Boot into Russian land without showing any form of documentation on the three conditions that they don’t walk, don’t pick wild mushrooms, and that their car never stops moving. If your car breaks down or runs out of gas while passing through the boot, you have violated these laws, and if caught by one of the Russian spy towers installed at the border, you could be subject to arrest. Although an alternative route was recently constructed between Lutepää and Sesniki without traveling through Russia, it’s a 25-minute detour compared to the two-minute direct route through the Saatse Boot. Although a plan was laid out in 2005 and again in 2014 to return the Saatse Boot to Estonia, it is yet to see fruition in the real world, and the “No Pedestrians” and “No Stopping For One Kilometer” roadside signs are still in place.",border crossings geographic oddities borders cars transportation
31,Maarjamäe Memorial Complex,"Tallinn, Estonia",This striking memorial is one of Estonia’s most controversial Soviet leftovers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maarjamae-memorial-complex,"In 1960, an obelisk was raised beside the sea in Tallinn’s subdistrict of Maarjamäe (which in Estonian means “Maria’s Hill”). It commemorated the Bolshevik victims of the 1918 Russian Civil War, part of which played out here when Allied nations intervened against the Bolshevik forces in the Baltics. The obelisk was designed by architect Mart Port, one of the authors of Tallinn’s Modernist Väike-Õismäe district, along with the sculptor Lembit Tolli. That obelisk alone was already controversial. The Bolsheviks had actually been fighting against Estonia during the conflict it referenced, and numerous memorials to Estonia’s own dead were removed during the years of Soviet occupation. Nevertheless, in 1965, a decision was made to expand the memorial complex at Maarjamäe, and an architectural competition was announced. The winning design was created by the architect Allan Murdmaa, along with sculptor Matti Varik, and consisted of a number of interconnected symbolic structures: the preexisting 115-foot (35-meter) obelisk would be joined by memorial graves for the crew members of the destroyers Avtroil and Spartak, which had served the Bolshevik-controlled Baltic Fleet during the Russian Civil War, while a series of sculpted iron and concrete figures memorialized the Soviets who fell against Nazi forces from 1941 to 1944. The construction of the new memorial complex was overseen by the architects Allan Murdmaa, Valve Pormeister, and Henno Sepmann. It was completed in 1975. At the sea end of the complex, a symbolic amphitheater overlooks the road to Pirita and offers a dramatic panoramic view over Tallinn Bay. An “eternal flame” occupied a corner of this space, surrounded by evocative hand-shaped reliefs. A long corridor framed between landscaped banks leads away from the water, inland toward the memorial graves, its exaggerated length presumably designed to provide space and time for reflection. Bisecting this pilgrimage path meanwhile, a perpendicular route cuts across and leads through a crooked gateway formed between faces of white dolomite stone. Above the path, an abstract bronze sculpture titled “Perishing Seagulls” seems to depict wounded birds in chaotic flight. Since Estonia gained its independence from Soviet rule in 1991, the Maarjamäe Memorial Complex has faced an uncertain future. Its symbolism goes beyond being merely pro-Soviet, to being, arguably, even anti-Estonian in meaning; celebrating the Bolshevik troops who died fighting against independent Estonia in 1918, while featuring the graves of crewmen from two Russian battleships that had been shelling the port of Tallinn during the conflict. The memorial complex is notably free from vandalism or graffiti, though neither is it maintained; just recently, the amphitheater has been fenced off against visitors over fears of structural instability. Meanwhile, some efforts have been made to address the balance of history. In 1998, the city partially restored the former German war cemetery that was originally set here in 1941, and contained some 2,300 internments before the Soviets built over it. More recently, Tallinn established a new counter-monument nearby: the Memorial to Estonia’s Victims of Communism, opened in 2018, to remember the 75,000 people—20 percent of Estonia’s population—who were killed during the years of Soviet occupation.  The Maarjamäe Memorial Complex overlooks Tallinn Bay from its location on Pirita Road, east of the city center. The recent opening of the nearby Memorial to Estonia’s Victims of Communism gives visitors even more reason to make the trip out here, the two memorials between them providing a multifaceted reflection on Estonia’s 20th century history.",war memorial soviet history monuments

The Kohtla mine was opened in 1937, seeing workers entering the tunnels and sorting the burnable shale stone by hand. They also quarried the rock above ground at the same time as the men toiled underneath. This two-pronged approach turned the mine into a booming venture and the facilities were upgraded and expanded over the years until there was a large processing facility above ground. Unfortunately business eventually slowed until the mine was forced to close in 2001. Even though the mine had to stop production, the equipment located on the site and the proud legacy of the people who had worked the stone remained wonderfully intact. Where most mines would have been left to rust and rot into a haunting ruin, the Kohtla tunnels were reopened just eight months later as a museum and historic site. Today, visitors can come to the historic mine and tour the silent tunnels. All of the old equipment can still be found on the grounds as though the workers simply walked off the job minutes earlier.

While some of the graves are crude and simple affairs the likes of which could be found in just about any historic cemetery, the graves of the many of the military pilots are topped with actual tail fins from Russian aircraft. The effect almost looks as though a squadron of the ships are burrowing through the ground with their fins above the surface like sharks. The aircraft parts stand in stark contrast to the wild greenery surrounding them.

Its patrons and staff also played a role in the cultural uprising that led to the country winning its independence from the Soviet Union. The KuKu Club (KuKu Klubi) was established in 1935 in the basement of the Tallinn Art Hall, built by the local arts community to house galleries and studios for the city’s creatives. Formally called the Imaginative Arts Club, or Kujutlev Kunstnikkude Klubi, the subterranean tavern quickly became a bohemian hotspot in the mold of the jazz clubs of New York and Paris. It was a place where writers, painters, and musicians could gather each evening for cheap food and drink while debating political and cultural issues with academics and agitators until dawn. There was much to discuss. After a brief taste of independence from 1920 to 1939, Estonia was first occupied by the Soviet Union, then by Nazi Germany, and finally by the Soviets again. For the next four decades, Soviet authorities conducted mass deportations, conscriptions, and executions of the Estonian people while also suppressing their history and culture, including a ban on singing patriotic Estonian tunes. Meanwhile, the KuKu Club quietly became an “oasis in the middle of the Soviet desert,” as Heinz Valk, an Estonian artist and activist, put it later. Valk, who for many years served as president of the club, said KuKu was more than just a nightclub; it was the birthplace of countless ideas and movements. “It can be said without exaggeration,” he wrote, “that the concentration of brilliant word masters per square meter in KuKu could not be equaled in all of Estonia.” Valk is credited with coining the term “the Singing Revolution” to describe the nonviolent, culturally based uprising against the Soviet occupation of Estonia during the late 1980s. The movement reached its apex with the Estonian Song Festival in September 1988, during which participants performed patriotic and traditional music in defiance of, and within full view of, Soviet agents and informants. Two months later, Estonia declared its independence. In August 1989, some 2 million people joined hands to form a human chain, dubbed “the Baltic Way,” that stretched 372 miles (600 kilometers) across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. By 1991, the Soviet Union was no more. But Estonia still holds its song festival every five years in Tallinn, featuring performances by more than 30,000 vocalists. In 2014, Valk wrote a memoir, The Golden Years of the KuKu Club (KuKu Klubi Kuldsed Aastad), which documents the contributions of club regulars to the independence movement. (No English translation of the book yet exists, unfortunately.) Today, the KuKu Club remains open, known more for its live music than its revolution-inspiring conversations. The club celebrated its 85th anniversary in January 2020 with a reading by Valk and a performance by one of Estonia’s most celebrated punk-rock bands—a fitting tribute to KuKu’s history, and Estonia’s.  The entrance to the KuKu Club is just off Tallinn’s Freedom Square. Walking north between the square and St. John’s Church will deposit you at the front of the Tallinn Art Hall. The club doorway, marked with a small sandwich board, is to the right of the building entrance and down a narrow staircase.

Construction on the facility began in 1939 and it was used with few intermissions until the Soviet military finally left Estonia in the 1990s, after which it was left to rot. During its operating life, the airfield was mainly used as a launch site for Interceptor fighter jets. The runways and 28 airplane hangars are no longer in use, but they are are still standing for the most part, a remnant of a darker time in Estonian history. However, this is not to say that the place sees no action, as some people still use the long paved stretch for street races and Fast-and-Furious-style drifting. Surprisingly these are often not even illegal, with event organizers coming together to host the races. Despite the abandonment, most of the hangars seem to be in order, except that their metal doors are long gone. Now they act as haunting cement echo chambers that reflect the voice and noise of any visitors to the site. The airfield is located just next to the Ungru Manor, a ruin of dilapidated former grandeur.

Construction of the giant tower began in 1975 in order to provide a higher quality broadcast for viewers of the 1980 Olympics, and was completed just in time for the games. A total of 32 construction companies took part in building its three main components: the 625-foot (190-meter) reinforced concrete trunk, the 400-foot (124-meter) steel antenna, and a support structure wrapping around the perimeter, 50 stories straight up. More than 17,500 tons of a specialized concrete mixture, developed by the Tallinn Polytechnic Institute, and 235 miles (380 kilometers) of reinforcement rods make up the tower and secure it safely. It’s located just northeast of Tallinn, Estonia’s capital and largest city. The dizzying viewing tower is open to the public, and provides visitors with a 360-degree view of Estonia’s Muuga forests, metropolitan Tallinn, and the coast of the Gulf of Finland. The observation deck provides a hands-on opportunity to learn about Estonia’s history and famous landmarks, and brave souls can opt to step out onto the edge of the tower in a harness. If you’d rather skip the strapping in, at 575 feet (175 meters) above the ground, even from behind windows the view will take your breath away.

It’s the perfect location for the city’s Museum of Photography, which is adjacent to Tallinn Town Hall (the famous site of Vana Toomas). The Fotomuseum is an intimate, impactful museum that is enjoyable for those even with the slightest interest in cameras and the art of photography. Located in a 14th-century building that was once a prison, the museum’s imposing architecture is as fascinating as its exhibits. Snug rooms are separated by thick stone walls, and the floors are linked by steep, medieval staircases and arched doorways. One narrow staircase has its own tale to tell, having been lost behind a wall for years. The building also includes a small enclosed courtyard where photos are exhibited outdoors. When you peer up at the tiny square of open sky, it feels as though you’re inside a camera yourself. Several permanent displays document the history of photography in Estonia, particularly from 1840 to 1940. There are daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and ferrotypes; historical scenes that can be both poignant and hilarious, stereo images, and a model of an early 20th-century darkroom. Another room contains dozens of exquisitely preserved antique cameras, from a huge glass-plate monstrosity—to a Minox subminiature spy camera invented in Tallinn. The museum’s basement houses exhibitions of contemporary art photography, which is given added depth and context by its proximity to the historical photos. There is also a small gift shop with books and souvenirs.  The entrance fee is €4 for adults, €2 for students and seniors, or free with the Tallinn Card.

The distinct ringed crosses look out of place amid the newer, more traditional designs found atop nearby plots. The crosses date to anywhere from 1743 to 1923. Because of the circle, they’re frequently referred to as Celtic crosses. But the arms of the cross hardly extend beyond the circle, making the markers look more like the wheel crosses found in pre-Christian religious symbolism. The unusual grave markers are leftover relics from when Estonian Swedes lived on the island. The islanders carved names, dates, family symbols, and other notes into the limestone and sandstone headstones. This particular style of cross is unique in Estonia, and is only found within places settled by the Coastal Swedes. Vormsi was inhabited by Estonian Swedes for much of its history, from the 13th century up until World War II. Almost all of the island’s residents were either evacuate to or fled to Sweden during the war. Now, only about 400 people live on Vormsi.",crosses celtic graveyards cemeteries

A quaint Eastern European village awaits you rich with Estonian culture. Kihnu’s traditions and culture were declared “Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity” by UNESCO. Historically, the men of Kihnu usually went to sea while the women ran the island. Therefore, women became the protectors of the island and its heritage. This heritage includes handmade objects, games, dances, and music. Music is an extremely important part of Kihnu’s culture and usually accompanies handicrafts and celebrations. Another distinct aspect of Kihnu culture is their clothing. Traditional Kihnu clothing is decorated with symbols and vivid colors that represent legends and poems from ancient times. Kihnu’s people speak an Estonian dialect that borrows many of its components from Swedish and is sometimes even considered its own distinct language.  From Pärnu, one can take a 15-minute plane ride of a 3-hour ferry ride to Kihnu. From Manilaid, it is a 1-hour ferry trip to the island.

43,Karja Church,"Linnaka, Estonia",Inside this medieval church resides a unique set of murals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/valga-estonia-valka-latvia,"When in Valga, Estonia/Valka, Latvia, head to where Sepa tänav (Valga) meets Semināra iela (Valka). There, you’ll see physical reminders of the border that slices the town into two different countries. This national border in the middle of a single small town has appeared, disappeared, reappeared, and disappeared again over the last hundred or so years. It’s a testament to the complexities of history in the Baltic region. In 1918, both Estonia and Latvia declared their independence, and two years later, with various opponents defeated, the time came to finalize the border between the two states. This proceeded smoothly and without conflict, with one major exception: the railway junction of Walk, a mid-sized but strategically important town where there were roughly equal numbers of Estonians and Latvians. The newly created League of Nations sent Sir Stephen Tallents, a British diplomat, to resolve the situation. And after some deliberation, he came up with a simple solution: the border should follow the little stream that meanders through the center. Walk was renamed in the national languages of the two states, so the Estonian side became Valga and the Latvian side became Valka. Estonia had rather more reason to feel satisfied with Tallents’s decision: they got the railway station and the majority of the center. To enforce the newly created international frontier, staffed border posts appeared throughout the town, looking incongruous in the middle of residential streets. However, it seems that not all crossings were consistently enforced. When visiting Valka in 1925, the travel writer Owen Rutter described how he was told by Latvian officials that he had to get permission from the police if he wanted to cross the border. He set off in search of the police station and was only alerted that he’d inadvertently wandered into Estonia when he suddenly noticed that the street signs now ended in “tänav” not “iela.” In 1939, under pressure from their giant eastern neighbor, all three of the Baltic states acceded to the placement of Soviet troops on their territory, and a year later, they were incorporated into the Soviet Union, following elections in which only one party was allowed to stand. The border towns unexpectedly found themselves in the same country once more. Although Valga and Valka retained their different names and were technically in different republics, the border was removed and the town effectively functioned as one again. But in 1990, as resistance to the Soviet Union gathered strength in the Baltic region, both Estonia and Latvia declared the restoration of independence. Border infrastructure again popped up in the center of the town—and owners of some houses that had been constructed or extended in the interim found themselves partially in both countries. Before long, the situation had changed once again. In 2004, both countries joined the European Union, and three years later, the Schengen Zone. This meant that, as between all Schengen members, all border checks were removed. In Valga/Valka, this was commemorated at an event where Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Latvian president Valdis Zatlers shook hands over the border crossing between their two countries before its removal. At the ceremony, Ilves commented “the barriers are lowered. The way is open. The path that starts in Lapland takes us non-stop, even through Valga and Valka, to the southern tip of Portugal. It is all our Europe.” The cities now cooperate closely together, and both have the official slogan “one city, two countries.” Latvians now frequently stroll across the border to take advantage of the wider range of shops on the Estonian side, while people from Valga and the surrounding area often venture to Valka to stock up on comparatively cheap Latvian beer.  There are a number of border crossings throughout the town. The largest one, where the former border infrastructure can still be seen, is where Sepa tänav (Valga) meets Semināra iela (Valka). The other main border crossing in the town is at the crossroads between Rīgas iela (Valka) and Raja tänav (Valga). Some of the borders are pedestrianized, such as the one that links Sõpruse tänav (Valga) and Raiņa iela (Valka). The only train station in the town is in Valga: Latvian trains going north from Riga, as well as Estonian trains going south from Tartu, terminate here.",border crossings geographic oddities borders geographic markers soviet history politics

The forest near the cemetery of Rosma village has around 200 such trees, that may prevent hauntings but still look somewhat ghostly. The way the rite usually plays out is that, on the way to the cemetery, the funeral procession stops at a certain tree, and usually a male descendant cuts the cross into the bark. In some areas there is only one tree for cutting crosses into, and it is used by the whole community, in some areas different families have their own tree so that all the members can be marked on the bark of that tree when their time comes. Also in some areas it is customary to use a pine to cut a cross for a male member and spruce for a female member (occasionally birches and oaks are also used). There are many ideas of why these crosses are made. One origin of the tradition is that the soul uses the tree to go climb up to heaven. However the main belief behind the tradition is that it prevents the soul from returning to haunt others. Of course it is also simply an evocative memorial gesture to remember the dead by. Unfortunately many of the trees and forests have been cut down in the modern era, and the Rosma forest was also partly damaged due to road extension works. Still, this practice of marking a tree with a cross is still observed by the older generations, so new trees with crosses cut into the bark are still showing up.",funeral art crosses trees plants

It depicts Peko, an Estonian and Finnish god of crops. Peko is particularly associated with beer, as he’s strongly linked to barley and brewing. Peko is still celebrated by the Seto people, an indigenous ethnic minority in Estonia. The Seto also view the god as a hero and king who has come to symbolize the Setomaa region, which straddles part of the border between Estonia and Russia. The local folk religion managed to exist alongside Orthodox Christianity for centuries. People held nighttime rituals and festivities and hid Peko statues in their granaries. Though its followers had dwindled by the early 20th century, the fall of the Soviet Union put the old religion and Peko back in the spotlight. When the current border between Russia and Estonia was set, it sliced through Setomaa, threatening to divide its native people. The locals revived their folk religion customs and added some new ones as well. They declared Peko King of the Setos and now hold yearly celebrations to elect a vice-king and queen, who are said to communicate with the god in their dreams. This statue of Peko stands atop Jumalamägi, which the Seto believe is a sacred hill. Legend says the hill is where God arrives with a horse-drawn wagon to ferry the souls of the dead to Heaven. People visit the hill and the Peko icon to get blessings for themselves, their families, and their friends. Kolossova is best reached with your own transport. One road also cuts through the Saatse Boot (https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saatse-boot). The statue is located on a hill close to a bus stop.

46,Ruhnu Lighthouse,"Ruhnu, Estonia",It's rumored this unique Baltic beacon was designed by Gustave Eiffel himself.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hiumaa-eiffel,"Armed with wooden logs and long nails, Jaan Alliksoo has long been a prominent figure in Estonia’s DIY Eiffel Tower scene. Having completed his first tower in 1978 at the tender age of 17, Alliksoo began his career in tower construction. Alliksoo’s first tower was also created for use by Russian forces. In 1978 when he built his structure, it was used to watch over cows in the collective farms in the region. It also attracted KGB interest in the hopes they could see Sweden, 170 miles to the West. Although his initial tower stood for only 10 years before being taken down due to dangerous conditions, Alliksoo had started a long process of honing his craft. After his first tower was disassembled, he built another in its place, higher than the last. This tower was eventually dismantled as well in 1997, and Alliksoo began formulating plans for his next tower, which would be his crowning achievement. By studying plans on the internet, Alliksoo created his own plans to make a replica of the Eiffel Tower. His replica would still feature a folksy wooden construction, and would be a 1/10 scale model of its French predecessor. With Estonia free from Soviet influence since 1989, Alliksoo decided to create the tower for tourism, allowing visitors to see across the island of Hiiumaa and out over the Baltic. When Alliksoo finished the tower in 2007, it stood at 31 meters, a near perfect, albeit rickety model of the Eiffel Tower. Since its creation, Alliksoo has faced a number of challenges from the Estonian government, requesting that he dismantle the dangerous tower. Despite the negative government reaction, the tower has attracted 30,000 visitors per year and has developed a status as a traditional monument on the island.

A symbol of liberation. A symbol of oppression. The controversial Soldier of Tallinn has been many things to many different people. The Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, nicknamed “Aljoscha” by the city’s Russian-speaking population, is a 6.5 foot tall monument dedicated to the memory of the soldiers of the Red Army who died in World War II. Now located in the Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn, it was unveiled in 1947, three years after Soviet forces reoccupied Estonia. While it was meant as a monument to brave Soviet soldiers, the statue became a divisive symbol of Soviet power in the country. Estonia, one of the 15 republics forming the Soviet Union until officially regaining independence in 1991, proved a thorn in Moscow’s side, with informal armed resistance against Soviet rule lasting well into the 1950s and peaceful protests, a common occurrence in the late 1980s. It was in the three Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) that political opposition movements challenging Moscow were first established in the Soviet Union. The monument once stood in central Tallinn but was moved to its current location in 2007. This was staunchly opposed by the country’s large Russian-speaking minority, with heavy riots taking place on April 26 and April 27. The existence of two conflicting cultures of remembrance in Estonia make the monument controversial. To the Russians of Estonia, the Red Army liberated a Soviet republic from the Nazis; to Estonians, the Red Army reoccupied and annexed a sovereign country again into the Soviet Union as they had already done in 1940, one year before the Nazi invasion. The haunting stare of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn exudes solemnity, but the statue embodies the conflicts regarding memory in much of the former Western periphery of the Soviet Union.

48,Tartu Student Lock-Up,"Tartu, Estonia",Troublesome students were detained in this tiny graffiti-covered university jail.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tartu-student-lock-up,"The University of Tartu in southern Estonia is the highest-ranked university in the Baltic states (according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings), and the only one to appear on the list of the top 500 universities in the world. Not all of its students have been upstanding citizens, though, as a graffiti-covered little room high up in the rafters of the university’s main building colorfully demonstrates. For decades, the university has supplied Estonia with its establishment: 40 percent of current representatives in the Riigikogu, the Estonian parliament, attended the university, as did 87 percent of practicing attorneys, and an astonishing 99 percent of Estonian doctors—not to mention every single judge practicing in the country. But that doesn’t mean the university hasn’t seen its fair share of troublemakers, too. This student lock-up, originally one of five, was built in 1802 to provide correction to those who “had offended public morality and the code of student conduct,” as the university’s website put it. Such offenses against morality could range from, at the lower end, unpaid debts or hiding one’s name or social class (punishable with one day’s imprisonment) to dueling, which received the maximum penalty of three weeks. The longest case on record was of a student locked up for four months for gouging out a fellow student’s eye during a duel in a tavern. But it would be wrong to assume that all of those locked up emerged repentant and eager to make amends to society: among the texts scrawled on the wall, almost all in Latin or German (the latter was the language of instruction until 1919, when the university switched to Estonian), you can find lines like: “The plan of creation has one thing not upright/That we cannot drink in sleep at night” and “What a blessing are wine and girls/Nota bene! They go together splendidly!” A fire in 1965 gutted much of the university building and destroyed four of the five original lock-ups. The one that remains has undergone considerable renovation. But it saw little use in the 20th century, with one significant exception. The Estonian poet Hannes Varblane, while a student at the university in the early 1970s, volunteered to be locked up there as part of a deal to escape being kicked out of the university. He had a poor attendance record and was under threat of expulsion, but promised he would study while imprisoned.  You can visit the lock-up as part of a tour offered by the University of Tartu Art Museum, which is inside the main building at Ülikooli tänav 18 (ask at the reception through the main doors to be directed there).

Surrounded by 70 hectares of wooded parkland with an ornamental lake, formal gardens, and several museums, the complex sits on the edge of Kesklinn district of Tallinn. The palace, designed by famed Italian architect Nicola Michetti, is an exquisite example of Petrine Baroque architecture, which flourished in St. Petersburg in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Great Hall at Kadriorg is pristine white, with light streaming in through its many windows and an exuberance of stucco ornamentation. Stylized monograms of Peter and Catherine are crafted on opposite walls above the highly ornate fireplaces. The ceiling has a beautiful mural, depicting a scene from Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The goddess Diana is seen bathing in a celestial spring along with her nymphs, while an enraptured Actaeon watches, as yet unnoticed. Aside from a few paintings of members of the Romanov dynasty, little else remains to suggest that the palace was once a royal residence. Its rooms now exhibit paintings and art objects from Russia and the rest of Europe. A formal garden graces the back of the palace, with precisely laid gravel paths, flower beds, and fountains. When Peter commissioned his summer palace, Tallinn had capitulated to his victorious army. However, the Great Northern War was still raging elsewhere in the region. Catherine often accompanied her husband during his military campaigns and when in Tallinn, stayed in a modest cottage, since Kadriorg was still under construction. Unfortunately, Peter did not live to see the completion of his summer palace and Catherine lost all interest in it after his death. It was not until the reign of Nicholas I that extensive renovations began in Kardiorg Palace. Once complete, the Tsar and his family began spending their summers in the palace. Members of the royal court followed and soon a district of elegant summer villas grew around Kadriorg. However, the popularity of Kadriorg as a summer destination waned with the cessation of the Crimean War. Being accessible once more, the salubrious weather of the Black Sea coastal retreats was preferable to the cool, damp, northern summers on the Baltic. Today, the palace houses a museum showcasing European art from the 16th to the 18th centuries.  A visit to the House Museum of Peter, a short walk from the palace, is recommended. Its modest size and interiors, reflect a life of simple domesticity lived by Peter and Catherine, when in residence.",russia palaces royalty architecture

The “island of crows” is in the middle of the border between Russia and Estonia, and was once home to the world’s largest cotton spinning mill. Some of the complex is still being used by private companies, but most of the grand buildings lie empty. In 1857, a year after he bought the whole island, Ludwig Knoop founded the Kreenholm Manufacturing Company. Knoop was a pioneer of the Russian cotton industry, and used English architecture and machinery, and often English technicians and supervisors. In 1872, after a cholera epidemic took the lives of over 400 employees, the mill’s internal police were forced to disband. When they were reinstated a year later, the workers revolted. The first strike in Estonia led to a riot, and state police were called in. An investigation revealed awful working conditions in the plant—including children forced to work from 5 a.m to 9 p.m. The internal police were officially ended, and, though wages stayed low, Kreenholm began offering health insurance and supplied dorms and schools. The 32,000-acre plant employed 12,000 people in its heyday, but by 1944 the company was in ruins. The Soviet Union took over until it was privatized in 1994. It limped along until going bankrupt in 2010. The dorms, which were added later, and some other buildings were torn down, but the factory’s earliest buildings still stand—for now.

In 1992, the American artist, engineer, and architect Chuck Hoberman designed the “Expanding Sphere” for the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. The isokinetic structure, which is still on show in New Jersey (and remains the world’s second largest), resembles a geodesic dome, but one that can fold down to a fraction of its original size thanks to the scissor-like action of the joints within it. Seven years later, in 1992, Hoberman decided to mass produce his sphere as a children’s toy. Made of colorful plastic pieces, the Hoberman Sphere, as it was called, went on to sell in the millions, introducing kids to a fun object originally designed as an innovative example of structural engineering. Today, Hoebrman Spheres hang in various science and technology centers across the world, including in Germany, Switzerland, South Korea, and Japan. But none are larger than the expanding sphere that hangs in Tartu’s AHHAA Science Center. Made from aircraft-grade aluminum, this Hoberman Sphere expands from 4.9 to 19.4 feet (1.5 to 5.9 meters) in diameter in about three seconds. The structure weighs 750 pounds (340 kilograms) and is formed of 244 hubs and 1,440 linkages connected by 2,880 pins and 5,760 bearings. The extension and folding of the sphere is controlled by two actuator cables that alternately pull the sphere’s opposing polar hubs. This creates the seemingly organic expansion and contraction of the sphere, its behavior demonstrating the concept of biomimicry, as can be seen in this short video.  The world’s largest Hoberman Sphere is suspended from the centrally-located domed atrium in the AHHAA Science Center in Tartu, the second largest city in Estonia.

55,Narva Lenin,"Narva, Estonia",A statue of the Soviet leader still stands in a quiet corner of Estonia’s most Russian city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/narva-lenin,"The city of Narva is located at the easternmost tip of Estonia. Only the waters of the Narva River separate it from Russia. On the far bank, the citizens of Ivangorod, Russia, can be seen going about their daily business there. This border is more significant than most in Europe, marking the boundary between the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization on one side, and Russia on the other—yet here it feels bucolic, the far side almost close enough to touch. During the Soviet occupation of Estonia (1944 through 1990), the border between the Estonian and Russian Soviet Socialist Republics was far more fluid than it is today. Many ethnic Russians wound up settling in Narva. A 2011 Estonian census showed that 87.7 percent of Narva’s citizens were ethnic Russians, while 95.7 percent spoke Russian as a first language. As a result, Narva, Estonia’s third largest city, can often feel far more Russian, in terms of culture, than its very progressive and Western-looking capital, Tallinn. And while many Soviet-era monuments have been removed in other Estonian cities, Narva has held onto its statue of one of the most divisive Russian figures of all: Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The Lenin statue originally stood in pride of place on Narva’s central square. Created by the famed Estonia sculptor Olav Männi, this bronze likeness was raised in 1957 and it was just one out of countless Lenins that decorated public spaces across the Soviet-occupied Baltic states. Following the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991, the majority of the country’s Lenin statues were taken down. In Narva however, with its predominantly ethnic Russian population and a city council that was then still largely composed of ex-communists, the 10-foot statue of Lenin remained in place until December 1993. Crowds came out to protest the statue’s removal. One former city council member, Yuri Mishin, called it an “act of vandalism,” arguing that, “Lenin is loved in this city and most residents are very angry about this.” However the city’s new mayor, Raivo Murd, saw the statue’s removal as a chance to break with a complicated history. “In the past, when we tried to tell investors we were pro-reform, they took one look at that Lenin statue and said: ‘We don’t believe you,’” Murd was quoted as saying in the Associated Press However, Narva’s mayor was willing to compromise to keep the peace. The removal team were asked to handle the statue with respect —not to place the cable around Lenin’s neck—and rather than destroy the statue or hide it in a warehouse, it was simply removed to somewhere less conspicuous: the Teutonic Hermann Castle, Narva’s most popular tourist attraction. Built in the 14th century, today this riverside fortress watches over the border bridge where cars and heavy vehicles drive across the river from Russia to the EU, and vice versa. Beyond the river, it is mirrored by Russia’s own Ivangorod Fortress: built in response to the Teutonic Order, a century later, by Tsar Ivan III. It was here, to a quiet corner in the courtyard of Hermann Castle, that Narva’s Lenin made his final journey—and it is perhaps not without a note of irony that the former Russian revolutionary will spend the rest of his days inside the high stone walls of a structure built to defend against Russian invasion.  Located inside the main courtyard of Narva’s Hermann Castle (sometimes simply referred to as “Narva Castle”), itself administered by Narva Museum, access to the Lenin monument is dependent on the castle’s opening hours. The Lenin monument is neither an official nor permanent feature though, and so it’s always possible that some day it will be removed from public viewing altogether.",lenin soviet history castles monuments statues

The windmills were initially rebuilt for a documentary in the end of 1970s but since then have became popular among tourists. Also newlyweds started a tradition to bring stones with their names and marriage date for good luck and place them under the windmills. There is no proof if a special blessing has become out of it but the windmills are still loved and a visited site. The statues stand in a village of Ninase close to bus stop.",windmills sculptures
57,Rakvere Aurochs Statue,"Rakvere, Estonia",This behemoth bovine guards an Estonian town and is a memorial to the lost species.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rakvere-aurochs-statue,"Up until the 17th century, aurochs, a species of large, wild cattle, roamed the European countryside. But hunting and a loss of habitat eventually led to the species demise. In 1627, the last known wild aurochs was found dead in Poland. Now, statues such as this serve as reminders of their existence. Aurochs are an ancient symbol of the town Rakvere (the old name of this area, Tarvanpää, comes from the local word for aurochs, tarvas). The sculpture debuted in 2002 to mark the 700-year anniversary of Rakvere receiving its city rights. The statue is 23 feet long, 13 feet high and weighs about 7.7 tons. The distance between the horns is about 11 feet. The artwork is considered to be the largest animal statue in the Baltic countries, and is likely the biggest aurochs statue in the world. Sculptor Tauno Kango recreated this animal based on old images, and specialists say that he has obtained a remarkable resemblance to the appearance of how these animals once looked. The statue is located next to the old Order Castle, giving you a glimpse of what it may have looked like in medieval times, back when aurochs once wandered freely around the area.  You can walk by the statue at any time. Please do not attempt to climb on it.",extinct animals cows statues animals

The shady oak that stands in the center of the Estonian parish of Orissaare is not the oldest tree in the area or even the largest but it may be the strongest, and is clearly the most beloved. The tree has not moved from its spot in over a century but the grounds around it have shifted leaving the tall arbor smack in the middle of the local football (European, not American) field. Under Stalin’s regime the tree was nearly torn out of the ground to create the pitch, but after cables were wrapped around the trunk, it refused to budge despite the cords biting into the bark. Supposedly the marks from the cables can still be seen. Today the tree still stands in the middle of the field, but instead of seeing it as a nuisance or an obstacle, the locals have embraced the plant, using it as a part of their games or just relaxing beneath its shady branches. The tree is so loved that it won the 2015 European Tree of the Year with a staggering 60,000 votes. Some politicians don’t even get that many votes.",european tree of the year trees plants
59,Hellemann Tower and City Walls,"Tallinn, Estonia",Walk along the medieval fortifications that have been protecting Tallinn since the 14th century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hellemann-tower-city-walls,"The Walls of Tallinn can be seen at several points around the city’s Old Town, but one section in particular, adjacent to Viru Square, contains one of the medieval fortification’s most important towers. The Hellemann Tower was named for a merchant who once occupied the land adjacent to it. Construction on this section of the city walls began in the 14th century, under the authorization of Danish King Valdemar II. It took some 300 years to complete because of interruptions caused by uprisings and, later, by the sale of Tallinn to the Livonian Order. By the 16th century, the Tallinn city wall was recognized as one of the strongest defense systems in Northern Europe. This section of the wall and the three-story Hellemann Tower can be accessed from a narrow street running roughly north from the Viru Gate. A set of more modern metal stairs lead up to the tower, but above the first story the steps used for access are largely original. On the first floor you can find a reproduction of the hatch and windlass system used to haul ammunition up to the guns. From the second floor, visitors have access to the city wall with its wooden walkway and red-tiled roof. From here one gets an unforgettable view over the roofs of the old town towards the historic town hall and two impressive cathedrals. The walkways are illuminated at night, providing an impressive view from street level.  Some of the stairways are steep, tight and not well lit.",walls towers medieval architecture

In 1590, the tower reached its maximum height of almost 159 meters (522 feet) and it is said in some quarters that it was at that time the highest building in the world. The church has been fully destroyed by fire at least three times and the tower has been reconstructed even more frequently. The current height is 124 meters (407 feet). Originally it was a Roman Catholic church dedicated to St. Olaf (also known as King Olaf the Second of Norway). During the Protestant Reformation, it became a Lutheran church and began to be one of two churches favored by the Baltic German elite of the city (the other being St Nicholas’s Church). By 1950, the Lutheran congregation had become too small for the church to be viable, as many Baltic Germans were forced out of Estonia by a pact between Hitler and Stalin before World War II. The church was then taken over by a Baptist congregation. The grip of the USSR over the structure was not loosened for many more years—from 1944 to 1991, the KGB used the church tower as a radio tower and an observation platform. Today, that observation platform is open to the public and provides fantastic views across the city and the nearby port. However the body of the church itself, although in the relatively simple Baptist tradition is very attractive, particularly the original architectural forms and the magnificent pulpit. Several memorial plaques in German are a reminder of the days when the congregation of this church was mainly Baltic Germans.  Entrance to the church is free but there is a 3 Euro charge to go up to the observation platform.",soviet history christianity towers churches architecture

Recently, recognition of the park’s importance to Estonian cultural heritage has led to its restoration and it is now a space for both recreation and memory. Several of the ancient tombstones have been retrieved and are gathered on display by the original baroque gate tower, and a special area marks former burial spots. Today, the multi-functional park is a local favorite. Lacking the grandiosity of Kadriorg Park (the location of the former palace across town) and off the tourist trail, Kalamaja Park is a place for contemplation and simpler joys. It maintains its beauty year-round, whether you visit in the long, gray winter when the park is covered in snow, or in the spring, when the snow melts and gives way to a lush carpet of mosses and ferns thriving under a dense canopy of trees. The trees are its crowning glory, left undisturbed over the years to grow tall and strong atop and amidst the former graves. If you look carefully, you can see the roots of one tree fiercely entwined around the remains of a broken grave fence that could not be fully removed by the occupied forces when they set about repurposing the cemetery. It serves as a poignant reminder of Estonia’s turbulent past and the struggle to preserve and record Estonian history and culture. Of course, knowing the park’s history as a former cemetery and its sorry story of neglect and reappropriation contributes to its unique and soulful ambiance. If you visit the park after dusk in November on Hingedepäev — Estonia’s All Soul’s Festival — you may see the park’s footpaths lined with burning candles in memory of ancestors past.",nature preserves urban planning soviet history graveyards burial places trees parks

It was commissioned by the electricity company Elering to raise public awareness of everyone’s role when it comes to electricity in modern society. It was also designed to demonstrate that even such a mundane object as an electric pylon can be artistic and enjoyable. The sculpture is 147 feet (45 meters) high and weighs about 33 tons. It’s made of steel tubes that are anchored to the bog with 25 piles reaching a depth of 62 feet (19 meters). The slender form and rustic color blend nicely with the natural setting of Kuistlema Raba. Sille Pihlak and Siim Tuksam created the pylon. The duo encountered a few engineering and design challenges when constructing the pylon. They had to be certain the structure was durable, well-grounded in the bog soil, and effective as a deviation point of electric lines. The final form of a squatting fox was just a lucky coincidence they discovered later. Hence the name, “Bog Fox.” The pylon opened in 2020.  Best to visit using your own transportation.

64,Lítla Dímun,"Lítla Dímun, Faroe Islands",This isolated island is often capped by its own fluffy cloud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/litla-dimun,"Lítla Dímun is the smallest of the Faroe Islands’ 18 main islands. But though it may be tiny, the islet still has the power to influence the atmosphere. A lenticular cloud often drapes over it like a wet, vapory blanket. These stationary clouds typically form over mountain peaks or other protruding landmasses. Lítla Dímun’s lenticular hovers above its top, occasionally spilling down over the verdant land as it reaches toward the cold sea. Of the Faroe Islands’ main islands, the little landmass is the only one that remains uninhabited by humans. But people do visit the island. For centuries, Faroese farmers have made the precarious journey to Lítla Dímun to tend to the creatures who rule the islet: its sheep. Up until the middle of the 19th century, Lítla Dímun sheep ruled the little green haven. It’s believed these black, short-tailed feral sheep were the descendants of the animals brought to the area during the Neolithic era. But after the last of these rare creatures was shot in the 1800s, rendering the bloodline extinct, the island became home to domesticated Faroes sheep. Every fall, farmers head to Lítla Dímun, scale its slick cliffs, and round up the sheep to bring them back to the main islands.  You'll most likely have to stick to admiring this island from the villages of Hvalba and Sandvík on the island of Suðuroy. It is possible to visit Lítla Dímun, though it's rare to have weather that's good enough to make a visit feasible, as you must use the ropes left by the farmers to help climb the cliffs.",weird weather phenomena sheep weather islands
65,Kallur Lighthouse,"Trøllanes, Faroe Islands",This isolated structure beckons adventurers with sublime views of the Faroe Islands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kallur-lighthouse,"The scenery surrounding the simple lighthouse at Kallur is dramatic: Craggy cliffs clad in layers of green grass spike toward a sky so blue it seems to merge with the sea. Wind-whipped clouds billow above while waves lash the land below. On a wet, stormy day (and there are many of those), stray wisps of sunlight mingle with the mist to create the occasional rainbow. The rustic, red and white lighthouse tops the northern tip of the island of Kalsoy. The isolated structure helps guide ships around the cluster of lands that crops up from the Atlantic Ocean to form the Faroe Islands. The picturesque scene around the lighthouse invites visitors to bask in the island’s beauty. Reaching this sublime spot requires a bit of effort, however. Visitors must follow an unmarked trail through stretches of vivid, verdant fields. Expect to encounter sheep along the way, and keep an eye out for their stone shelters—they’re a sign you’re on the right path. Though the island and its signature lighthouse are remote, they’re worth the trek. In addition to offering gorgeous views, the northern parts of Kalsoy are also an important birding area. The cliffs are a critical breeding place for seabirds like Atlantic puffins, European storm petrels, and black guillemots. The island of Kalsoy is sparsely populated. Only around 150 people call it home. A network of roads and tunnels connects the four settlements that are scattered around the flute-shaped landmass.  Hiking this path can be rough and muddy during most of the year.  Fog can also engulf the area and make the hike a bit more of a challenge. Once you reach the lighthouse, you will need to go a bit further along a steep path to get the epic view. This path does not have rails or anything to protect one from the harsh inclines on both sides so go at your own risk. You can reach the island via a ferry from Klaksvik (get there early as they fill up) or by helicopter. It is recommended to read about weather conditions and driving conditions in the Faroe Islands before heading to Kalsoy. The tunnels are all one lane and can be frightening for those who have never driven in such.",travel lighthouses islands nature

When viewed from afar, its seems that the lake is tilted towards the ocean, but only spills over in one small waterfall. This optical illusion also creates the impression that the reservoir is located hundreds of feet above sea level. In actuality, the elevation difference between the lake and the ocean is only about 30 meters; however, steep and significant elevation changes in the surrounding hills give the lake its seemingly impossible look. The lake is situated in a deep depression, and its towering headland rises 252 and 376 meters on the left and right sides. There is also some controversy regarding the lake’s name, since the people of Sørvágsvatn village take pride in naming the body of water after their home, while the citizens of some of the other nearby towns would rather call the lake “Leitisvatn,” since some of its waters intersect with their towns as well. Yet regardless of what the waters are called, the illusion they create is nothing less than nature pulling a big prank on all of us.",optical illusions cliffs lakes geological oddities water geology

A ring of tall mountains cuts it off from the rest of its own island, and, for most of its existence, from the rest of the world at large. Prior to 2004, there were only a couple of ways to get to Gásadalur Village. One option was to hike over the mountain terrain that surrounds the settlement, which rises over 2,000 feet high, and then trek for even more miles to the village. The other option was to clamber up the cliff face from any ship brave enough to venture that close to the rocks. In the 1940s a staircase was built into the cliff rocks to make travel a bit easier, but other than that, progress in terms of making the remote village accessible was almost nil. Because of this isolation, the population of the village fell dramatically despite a number of good, workable fields in their landlocked region. The number of citizens had dropped into the teens by the time a tunnel was blasted through one of the mountains allowing automobile travel to the small community. While the hope is that the population will grow with the use of the access tunnel, as of 2012 the reported population is still only 18. However the smaller population has ensured that the historically quaint houses and unspoiled vistas all around will stay around a bit longer.",villages transportation

While the sentiment has been challenged (most notably by Mark Twain who wrote “Put all your eggs in the one basket and watch that basket”) in the case of Skarð Village, in the Faroe Islands, the idiom is apt. On December 23, 1913 the day before Christmas Eve, all seven able-bodied men of the village climbed into a single fishing boat (quite possibly the only one in the village) and set out onto the North Atlantic Ocean presumably to catch a feast for the coming holiday. The men never returned. Without men (able-bodied ones at least, a young boy and an old man remained) the remaining women and children left the town for Haraldssund, and the last inhabitant left only six years after the accident, in 1919. Skarð remains a ghost town to this day, complete with crumbling stone houses. Haraldssund, where the Skarð villagers resettled, isn’t much better off with a current population of only 70. Two footpaths run to Skarð. One runs along the coast from Haraldssund; the other is a high mountain trail over Skarðsgjógv from the west coast town of Kunoy. The latter climbs about 600 metres and is a challenging route recommended for experienced mountain hikers only, though the villagers frequently used it to walk to Kunoy for Church services.",ghost towns

It’s often depicted as an aquatic monster that takes the shape of a gray, horse-like creature with inverted hoofs. The Nykur generally appears on the lakeshore, with half its body in the water, and looks to be quite tame to its unsuspecting victims. The legendary Nykur (also known as the “Nix” in English) uses its beauty to lure passersby to pet and mount it, and once an unsuspecting man, woman, or child does so, the beast’s “sticky skin” traps them in a terrifying barrel roll as it drags them down to the bottom of the lake to drown. This legend is mostly invoked by parents of small children, to scare them away from the edge of dangerous bodies of water. The Nykur’s one weakness is that if someone calls its name aloud, the creature will lose all of its power and retreat to the depths from which it came. And the Faroese legends say that once, a small child happened to see a Nykur roaming through the shallow water of Lake Sørvágsvatn while he was out playing. In awe of the creature’s beauty, the child approached the Nykur. The child wanted his brother, Niklas, to see the pretty horse as well, so he called out to him. Since the child was still small and unable to speak properly, he accidentally shouted the word “Nykur” instead of “Niklas.” Thus having spoken the creature’s name, it lost all its power and returned to the deep cold waters of lake Sørvágsvatn to try its luck another day. On the island of Vágar in the Faroe Islands, a silver statue of the mythical Nykur rises from the northern tip of Lake Sørvágsvatn. The statue was created by local artist Pól Skarðenni, and appeared in the waters of the lake in 2017. Nearby, a plaque tells the legend of this sinister beast.

Not a lot is known about the half-built St. Magnus Cathedral, which was erected sometime in the 13th century but never completed. Even still, it remains a major draw in Kirkjubøur, the southernmost village on Streymoy, one of the 18 of the Faroe Islands. Since 1997, conservation efforts have kept the cathedral ruins from further disintegrating. The preservation project has also increasingly drawn visitors to Kirkjubøur. However, since 2010, the efforts have slowed down a bit and the cathedral is slowly being consumed by the elements. St. Magnus Cathedral is located at the southern tip of Kirkjubøur, next to the family farmhouse (called Kirkjubøargarður)and St. Olav’s church, both structures dating to the year 1110 and still in use today. In fact, the farmhouse is occupied by the 13th generation of the Patursson family. Family patriarch and arguably among the most famous of Faroese artists, glass artist and sculptor Tróndur Patursson lives in a hillside home just up the road from the village’s more prominent landmarks. (His house is the one with all the beautiful glasswork on the facade.) Today, Kirkjubøargarður is a museum that you can visit with a trust system for payment (you can drop a payment inside). If you look out to sea from St. Magnus Cathedral, you will see Kirkjubøhólmur, a small islet that contains many remnants from historic Kirkjubøur that perished along with around 50 homes in the village during a 16th-century storm.

The tiny encampment has rested quietly on its land down the centuries, always teetering on the edge of complete depopulation, subsisting on a simple, rustic lifestyle among stunning mountain surrounds. It was not even until 1970 that electricity came to the town (the last town to be added to the power grid!) providing a rare splash of modernity to the remaining citizens. Years later, as the prospect of Múli becoming completely abandoned once again loomed, a road was finally built to link the community to the not-much-bigger town of Norðdepil. Unfortunately none of these measures could prevent the abandonment of the town, which as of 2002 has just four registered residents, although even this number may be a bit inflated. In reality, many of the still standing buildings that once composed Múli are now only used by vacationers on holiday.

The tunnel, which officially opened to car traffic at the end of 2020, measures over 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) long. At its deepest point, the tunnel is 189 meters (613.5 feet) below the seabed. The most interesting part of this infrastructure project, though, is the colorful intersection at its center—the first undersea roundabout in the world. The roundabout links the capital city of Tórshavn to both sides of the Skálafjørður fjord. Not only is it extra-convenient (cutting down travel time between Tórshavn and Runavík from over an hour to around 16 minutes), it’s also a feast for the senses.

But the unilluminated one-lane tunnels may be the biggest challenge drivers face. The mountainous terrain of the Faroe Islands has always been difficult for the people living there. Until tunnels were constructed, entire villages remained isolated, accessible only via long hikes or by sea. Though the tunnels were indeed a useful addition, they can make for some hairy driving. Driving through the one-lane tunnels can be challenging and invoke a feeling of horror-filled joy in even the most experienced driver. The one-lane tunnels have passing places spaced about 330 feet apart, where cars heading in opposite directions can yield to one another. When approaching one of these tunnels, you’ll want to make sure there’s a fair amount of distance between you and any other cars, so everyone can ensure they have access to one of these passing places.

Located on the northeastern edge of the island of Eysturoy, the village of Oyndarfjørður has all of 180 residents and was effectively completely isolated until 1969, when a paved road was finally completed. Just before the entrance to the village, there is a sign for the pathway to the rocking stones (Rinkusteinar), which are nestled off the side of the road near the inlet where the locals keep their boats. The stones themselves are a few meters from shore. Although they must weigh several tons each, they lightly bob along with the rocking of the sea (or at least one does - the second has been wedged into a permanent position by two stone blocks). Legend has it that an old sorceress cursed two pirate ships that were menacing the village - turning them to stone and condemning them to an eternity of restless rocking, tantalizingly close a forbidden shore. A chain connected to the mainland makes it easier to see the rock’s movements and - on a quiet day - you can hear the water mumble around the stone’s subtle disturbance.",rocks geological oddities natural wonders geology nature

This spindly monolith on the rugged coastline of the Faroe Islands measures 313 meters (1,026 feet) tall and it can be seen from many miles away. Not only is it a remarkable geological feature, it also holds significance in local legend. It is said that Trøllkonufingur is the finger of a large witch who arrived on the Faroe Islands to attempt to throw them northwards to Iceland. The legend holds that she was unsuccessful in this mission, instead reaching the sea by Vágar and turning into stone from the power of the sun. Due to her sheer size, it is said that she fell backwards into the ocean, with only her finger sticking out of the water. That pointed appendage became what is now known as the Trøllkonufingur. Only 11 hardy climbers are known to have made it to the top of this rocky feature. In 1844, a member of the royal entourage of Denmark got to the summit so that he could wave to the passing Crown Prince Frederick VII, who was sailing past in the sea. It is said that after descending successfully, he realized he had left his glove on the top of the rock. Tragically, after climbing back up to retrieve this, his fatigue alongside the treacherous conditions led to him slipping and falling to his death.  A short walk from the town of Sandavágur gives a great vantage point of the Trøllkonufingur.

The island of Mykines is one of the 18 main islands that make up the Faroe Islands. In 1925, the population of the island was 179 but more recent records show that the number now fluctuates between 10 to 15 people, making this a very isolated place to live. A small ferry visits the island, but the isolated location means that it is weather dependent and does not always run. The Mykines Holmur Lighthouse is situated at the far end of the island and the unspoiled surroundings give off a fascinating feel of remoteness. The lighthouse was built in 1909 and provided light for ships to navigate, as well as acted as a weather station. A house was constructed for the lighthouse keeper and historic notes state that the site was used by the University of Copenhagen to observe the Northern Lights. The Mykines lighthouse became automated in 1970.  Be sure to look at the forecast as the ferry to Mykines is very weather dependent.",shipping lighthouses history & culture

According to the resort’s website, the unique travel destination was started back in 1973 when its founder, Jussi, was traveling down the lonely roads just south of Finland’s northernmost fishing village. As the story goes, his car broke down, and he was forced to make camp near the isolated roadside woods. Instead of just thinking of this excursion as a minor inconvenience, he fell in love with the spot and set up a permanent roadside stop-in that eventually grew up to be the current Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort. The site of Jussi’s breakdown has grown into a luxury resort destination which features a variety of interesting accommodations. There are cozy log cabins, some with built-in glass nooks to better view the surrounding wilderness and auroras. There are the snow igloos which are little ice hotels where visitors can get warm in a very cold place. And perhaps most astoundingly, there is the field of glass igloos which all look like little see-through geodesic domes where nothing can obstruct your view of the Northern Lights.

The underground house of worship, called Temppeliaukion kirkko in Finnish, was designed by architect brothers Timo and Tuomo Suomalainen in the charmingly named Töölö neighborhood. On all sides of the circular church are roughly hewn stone, where sometimes water still seeps in to create miniature waterfalls. A dome coated with copper covers the rock church, with a skylight open in a belt below it to make the dome appear to hover. Even further below the church is a Cold War-era air raid shelter, which now serves as parking.

Assigned by the state the prestigious responsibility of preserving any and all printed and audiovisual material produced within Finland’s borders, the library is the gatekeeper to the country’s cultural heritage. The largest library collection in the country, the main building and annex of the complex contain over 109 kilometers of shelf space, home to over 3 million books and periodicals. Built to replace the Library of Academy of Turku after a devastating fire all but destroyed its 40,000 volume collection in 1827, the National Library of Finland has dedicated itself to collecting a vast array of heritage, its longevity allowing it to be the only scientific library whose collection includes material pre-1917, when Finland gained independence, and it has the largest, most comprehensive collection chronicling the Russian Empire existing in the world. Made up of two buildings, the Fabiania building and the Rotunda annex, the design shares influences that spread throughout the ages. The Rotunda is made up of typical Art Nouveau accents, while the main building follows the guidelines of Empire stylings. With vaulted ceilings and classical staircases throughout, each hall has its own color scheme, each lined with Greek and Roman plaster casts. The library was redesigned in 2001, but not everything is new or redone. The original iron fence in the library yard still stands, and by the south wall there sits a bronze bust of Czar Alexander I which has made the library its home since 1814. The main building of the Helsinki National Library was renovated in 2015 and opened again to the public in the spring of 2016.",repositories of knowledge libraries architecture
80,Kemi Snow Castle,"Kemi, Finland",This fantastical icy castle is built anew every winter.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kemi-snowcastle,"Less than 100 miles below the Arctic Circle in Finnish Lapland, beauty is fleeting. Each year, the massive Snow Castle in Kemi is reconstructed in January, only to melt into muddy sludge in the spring sunlight. The castle was first created in 1995 as a gift from UNICEF, and the tradition has been going strong in the community ever since. In total, it takes over five weeks to build the castle complex, due in large part to the amount of structures that comprise it. Although Finland gets its fair share of snow, builders actually use seawater-converting snow machines to create the powerful material for their snowy medieval fortifications. Along with the castle walls, which are over twelve feet high, the area also features a hotel, art gallery, and chapel, where some people even come from across the globe to get married. Each portion of the castle is lit with colorful lights that add splendor to the naturally ethereal ice walls. Many artists come to lend their talents to the castle by creating ice sculptures throughout the waterside structure as well. Situated right on the Bothnian Bay, the castle rises up like a majestic fairytale world in the cold Finnish winter. In many ways, the Snow Castle makes the long, dark northern winters a bit more bearable for the small town of Kemi. Although the main components of the castle are consistent each winter, the Snow Castle melts in the spring and is constantly built in a new configuration. During the last 15 years, the castle has been anywhere from 13,000-20,000 square meters and has even reached three stories high. Every year is a wonderful and chilly surprise for visitors, even those who have come in the past. Whether visitors come for an icy wedding reception or a stay in a below-freezing honeymoon suite, the Snow Castle is a fantasy experience that could bring out the inner child in the most cynical of travelers.

The figures are made up of peat heads covered in straw hair and simple wooden bodies draped with colorful clothing that is changed twice a year.

The truth is, the meaning of the art installation is a mystery. The artist refuses to give any sort of explanation for the figures, preferring the viewer use their own perception to define it.

85,Fortress of Suomenlinna,"Helsinki, Finland",This irregularly shaped sea fortress has defended not one but three different sovereign states.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortress-of-suomenlinna,"There are thousands of fortresses across the world, but Suomenlinna, in Finland, is different than most in several ways. For one thing, it has defended not one but three different sovereign states since its construction in 1748: the Kingdom of Sweden, the Russian Empire, and most recently, the Republic of Finland. The fascinating history of the Fortress of Suomenlinna, also known as Sveaborg, begins in the mid 18th century. Spread across six different islands, this unusually shaped naval fort was initially built by the Swedish on the Susiluodot islands near the Helsinki harbor, following a period of war between Sweden and Russia. Work on the island fortress lasted about 40 years. At that time, the name Sveaborg was rendered into Viapori in Finnish. In 1808, during the Russo-Swedish war, the fortress fell to the Russians, and was under the rule of the Russian Imperial Government. Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland the following year, but Viapori remained under Russia’s military rule. The Russians expanded the base, and added barracks and an Orthodox church. However, over the course of the 19th century, the fortress declined in importance and was largely left to decay. During the Crimean war, it also suffered heavy bombardment. It was not repaired until the late 19th century. Then, with revolutionary unrest brewing in Russia, a mutiny erupted at Viapori in 1906. It was brought under control and the fortress defended Russia during World War I. At the end of the war, Finland achieved independence, and in 1918 Viapori was taken over by the newly founded Finnish government and renamed Suomenlinna (Castle of Finland). Under Finnish rule, renovations on the fortress began, and it was used to defend the country during WWII. Since the 1960s, defense forces moved out and renovations began to make the fortress into a residential and tourist facility. In 1991, Suomenlinna was added to Unesco’s World Heritage List. Suomenlinna is now home to approximately 800 residents and a workplace for about 400 people. The Fortress of Suomenlinna is vast, with six kilometres of defensive walls stretching over six islands. The original fortress was built with local rock. Due to the varied landscape on which the fortress was built, it deviates from conventional fortification norms. Most of the buildings that date from the earlier Swedish and Russian periods are well preserved. Suomenlinna is accessible only by water, from Helsinki. To find out about ferries, and opening hours in winter and summer for various businesses operating on Suomenlinna, please see their website for details at: https://www.suomenlinna.fi/en/ The site features walking trails, parks, many different restaurants and cafes, a playground, theatre, an art gallery, and six museums.

86,Sibelius Monument,"Helsinki, Finland",An abstract monument to a symphonic composer.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sibelius-monument,"Finnish composer Jean Sibelius once said, “Pay no attention to what the critics say. A statue has never been erected in honor of a critic.” Bringing this adage to fruition is the Sibelius Monument in Helsinki. Erected in 1967 by Finnish sculptor Eila Hiltunen, the abstract monument resembles a sound wave made from clusters of organ pipes. It consists of over 600 steel pipes unevenly grouped together at various heights, with the highest pipe reaching over 27 feet in the air. The landmark was designed to embody the spirit of Sibelius’ music, but its abstract nature caused many critics of the statue to remark that it did not directly honor the composer. To this end, a large bust of Sibelius was added at the foot of the monument so that viewers won’t be confused. A smaller version of the Sibelius Monument is located at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, but the majesty of the full-size statue is a much more fitting homage to the bombastic artist.",music monuments statues

No matter the language, the name of the monument translates roughly to “Three-Country Cairn,” and was constructed in 1897 to settle a border dispute between the trio. With Russia aiding Finland in the negotiations, all three countries finally agreed to their borders and decided that the point where they all meet actually fell in the middle of a lake. Not that that stopped the construction of the stone. The tri-point stone itself, which features carvings from each respective side corresponding to the country it faces, sits atop a bulky yellow foundation of cement which keeps the plinth elevated no matter how high the waves or snow get. During the summer months, the cairn can be reached by crossing rickety wooden bridges that often dip into the lake, but in the winter months, it can usually just be approached on foot or sled. No matter the season, visitors are able to travel through three countries just by circling the stone, putting even the most prolific jet-setters to shame.",territorial dispute geographic markers monuments

The majority of these are human statues performing a variety of activities; one noteworthy sight features a cluster of roughly 200 figures, purportedly self-portraits of the artist, in various yoga poses. The sculptures are not particularly lifelike, but rather possess an otherworldly and at times downright sinister quality, with blank, sunken eyes, skeletal body proportions, ghoulish grins, and, in some cases, the use of real human teeth. Non-human figures include large treelike structures with cone-shaped branches. While he lived, Rönkkönen was known as something of a recluse. Despite his status as a small town paper mill worker however, he was incredibly well read, and was said to have experienced the world through the page, and the many ethnicities of his statues suggest this. Though he never discouraged visitors, he remained aloof from the tourism activities that cropped up in response to the public’s interest in his unusual collection. Despite requests, he refused to showcase his work outside his private residence.

It is the house of the famous fictional Moomin family. The stories of this lovable troll family were told by the Finnish author Tove Jansson in several children’s books and comics written between 1945 and 1970. The Moomin series was a massive success and led to many spinoffs that continue up until today. The full-sized Moomin House on the island of Kailo is modeled on Jansson’s drawings in the books. It is an oddly shaped abode said to be based on an old cockle stove, a kind of fireplace that the Moomin’s ancestors lived behind. It is tall and round and painted a whimsical blueberry blue with a red cone roof. In later years Jansson made a model of the house herself, one that looked drastically different from the first. Still, the original blue house based on the books is by many still considered to be the “real” Moomin House, an opinion that was shared by the creators of the Moomin World theme park in western Finland.

The “Campfire Barista” makes cafe-quality coffees, teas, and more over an open fire that he drags behind a snowmobile through a forest in the far northern reaches of Finland. It’s not just any forest, though. The forest belongs to his wife’s grandfather, Kaarle Raekallio. The Finnish state gave his family the forest after they lost their home during World War II. After spending decades raising the forest to be processed as timber, however, Raekallio decided to put the trees up for adoption and allow tourists to come spend time with the now dozens of trees on the property. It’s now known as Finland’s Hugging Tree Forest. It was while working as a guide in this forest, serving tourists campfire lattes, that Wunderink became the Campfire Barista. He developed a reputation around town for crafting wondrously smoky, espresso-based drinks and turning a local oddity called chaga—an antioxidant-rich mushroom that grows on birch trees—into chai lattes, all over an open fire. After a woman from the local tourism office complained about having to trek into the woods every day for her espressos, the C.F.B. bought a snowmobile and built a sled that could safely hold a fire grill. The cafe was now mobile, but as his caffeine empire refined, he needed beans that could better harness the flavor of the smoke. After asking around town for a source of organic, fair-trade coffee, he found a friend with ties to a single-estate, biodynamic coffee farm in Tamil Nadu, India. If it sounds too good to be true, the same friend also happened to operate a solar-powered coffee roaster out of a converted sea-container in town. Working directly with Wunderink, this well-found friend was able to roast beans to perfectly suit the flavor of an open fire. During winter months, you can catch Wunderink’s cafe in front of the tourism office in the center of town, in his family’s forest, or at a number of public events. Without snow in the warmer months, he’s restricted to stationary events and festivals. His menu has expanded beyond espresso-based drinks and chaga chai to selling white jasmine tea, organic rooibos tea, warm blackcurrant juice, lingonberry marshmallows you can roast over his fire, lingonberry cookies from his wife’s recipe, and chocolate dunkers—lumps of chocolate on a stick for children to dunk into hot water for hot chocolate.

First thing’s first: You do not have a dirty mind. (Or maybe you do, but this isn’t why.) Högberet Cave wouldn’t be half so renowned were it not for the fact that it looks strikingly like a vagina. Adorned by mosses and lichen, the rocky womb is located in an area ripe for trekking, where intrepid explorers locate its mouth by looking for an opening in a several-story high granite cliff. Formed by untold rivulets working their way through the rock, Högberget was born during a simpler period of human history, when the biggest problem was foraging amidst a period post-Ice Age deglaciation… Actually, when viewed through the lens of today’s daunting complexities, a major one of which includes the world’s largest ice sheets melting, visitors’ almost instinctive need to crawl back into a cave almost makes a lot of sense. Illuminated by light filtering through cracks above, upon sticking one’s head back inside Högberet Cave, the sight requires little imagination with regards to how a simple granite cave became a site of pilgrimage for those who believe in the fertility of Earth herself.

The city sports many buildings that are a few centuries old. If you’d like to see even older buildings, then you should head to Seurasaari, a quaint island in the Meilahti neighborhood that’s full of antique structures. The island is home to the Seurasaari Open Air Museum. Old buildings are scattered throughout the forest, as the location serves to store, preserve, and display historical Finnish buildings. The museum opened in 1956. The park is open all year. When you visit, you’ll find actors wearing traditional clothing and showing you the ways of a bygone time. The park began as a location for the celebration of Midsummer, an event that today is still its largest attraction. On this day, a gigantic wooden pyre is built and set ablaze by a newlywed couple, celebrating the summer in an old pagan way.  The park is open daily.

Built in 1901 by architect Eliel Saarinen, every molding, windowsill, and doorway on the exterior of the building is adorned with a carved stone beast. The term “Pohjola” refers to a mythic land from the Finnish epic the Kalevala in which the Northern region of Pohjola was ruled by an evil witch. It was also believed that the roots of the World Tree could be found in Pohjola, which may explain the many reliefs of trees and squirrels across the building’s facade. More broadly the word refers to any northerly direction. Given its mythological namesake, it’s no surprise that the Pohjola Insurance company agreed to adorn their building with lasting statues of monsters, fools, animals, and nature. Some office buildings are content to create a front of efficiency and bland production, but leave it to the Finnish with their rich history and mythic traditions to make an insurance building seem legendary.",fairytales sculptures statues architectural oddities architecture
96,Orinoro Gorge,"Leppävirta, Finland",Hidden deep in a forest is this geological wonder carved by glaciers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/orinoro-gorge,"A wonder of Savo Region, the Orinoro Gorge was carved out by glaciers during the last Ice Age. Paths constructed of wooden planks wind their way through nearly 700 feet (200 meters) of sliced rock faces, before looping around and leading upward to offer a bird’s eye view from the 65-foot (20-meter) high ridges. Sounds carry through the gorge like echoes in a cave. Chirping birds and skittering creatures are amplified off the ricochetting walls. Rock ledges and wooden benches provide the chance to sit and rest and are surrounded by peaceful nature. Orinoro Gorge can feel like another world, but it’s merely a small wondrous piece found hidden within the forest. The path through Orinoro leads to a small spring where ice and snow remain well into June, and where a chill lingers in the air even on the hottest days of summer. Further down the path is a second pond equipped with wooden lean-tos and firepits, perfect for a swim, a rest along the shore, or for grilling lunch. With lush, sprawling nature abound, the trails extend for around four miles (seven kilometers) and are an insight into the wonderful natural trappings that surround the Orinoro Gorge.  There are two main ways of reaching Orinoro Gorge. The front entrance has some parking and a small cafe and requires a casual 3-kilometer hike to the gorge. The back entrance, arguably the better of the two for those wanting a little extra taste of exploration, begins at the end of a small dirt trail, with room for one or two cars, at coordinates 62.502306, 28.020155. From there, it's less than a kilometer's trek along a small path that, depending on the season, is full of wild cloudberries and blueberries. For either path, waterproof shoes, long pants, and bug spray are recommended as the treks and gorge itself are often swamp-like and wet.",trails natural wonders nature

But in a surprisingly whimsical gesture, the National Archives of Finland has appointed a tiny furry ambassador to greet guests. With a pencil hefted on one shoulder, the diminutive rodent appears ready to sign documents, sketch portraits, or perhaps build a tiny log cabin. The artwork is titled “Viisas Hiiri” (“Wise Mice”), so no doubt the critter has something very clever planned. It was sculpted by artist and punk rocker Jyrki Siukonen and installed in 2000. Many visitors to the archives probably miss the mouse. It’s not exactly hiding, but its size and location make it hard to spot. It’s on a stone ledge beside a staircase leading up to the building’s cafe. Another part of the sculpture is located indoors on the second floor. The mouse’s co-conspirator crouches on a bronze book beside a ladder, keeping lookout over its pencil-wielding friend. The book is inscribed with the Latin proverb “Verba volant, scripta manent,” which translates to “spoken words fly away, written words remain.” Alluding to the permanence of written documents, it’s a fitting motto for the national archives. The sculpture is well-loved in Helsinki—perhaps too much, as it has required more maintenance than expected. It’s so small that parts of it have occasionally vanished without a squeak.  The outdoor mouse is located on the stone stairs of the national archives—not the lower staircase, but the upper one that leads to the cafe. It’s on a ledge beside the stairs. The indoor mouse is easily spotted on the second floor. Both are only accessible when the archives are open.",rodents archive hidden statues

Very few, however, know of its sculpture park filled with contemporary art. It all began in 2001 when a few Finnish artists decided to organize an art exhibition in a pine forest on one of the artists’ land outside of the Oranki village. Originally the plan was not to tell anyone about it, as a reaction to mainstream art, but as early as the second year newsletters were being sent out. New pieces have been added each year since and the exhibition has grown dramatically. The purpose of the exhibition is to promote contemporary art as well as the interaction between the public and the artists. That’s why a workshop is held when new pieces are added to start discussions around the artwork. Nowadays artists from countries outside Finland are represented as well. Many of the works are made of materials found in the forest where the exhibition is located. This of course makes them vulnerable to shifting weather and the seasons, and so many of the pieces have to be seen as temporary.  From the city of Pello on the border between Finland and Sweden go north along the E8. Turn right on Orankitie and then a right after 3,7 km (2.3 miles).

Its year-round and seasonal exhibits offer an intriguing, immersive look at the Sámi people who call the region home. The Siida Museum is a collaboration between the Northern Lapland Nature Centre and Sámi Museum. Its captivating exhibits highlight the deep, intrinsic connection the Sámi culture maintains with nature. Inside, a range of imagery, artifacts, and audio entices visitors to explore the past and present of this Northern culture. Exhibits detailing the region’s environment and natural history are intertwined with those that delve into Sámi culture. Sections examining the drastic seasonal changes that sweep across the Arctic landscape blend with those recounting how people manage to survive within such extreme climates. There’s also an open-air museum, open only during the summer months when the ever-present daylight lends its glow to the land. It resembles an eclectic village, where log buildings stand near lodges, tents, and huts. Particularly noteworthy are the grass-covered gold prospector’s cabin and peat-covered log hut, which look as though they’d be perfectly at home within a forest fairytale. Some of the buildings were relocated to the museum when it opened in 1960. Don’t be surprised if you see a reindeer or two roaming around.

As a bonus, it also features a 100-seat rotating restaurant, the first of its kind in the Nordic countries. As Northern Savonia is not noted for mountainous terrain, the city of Kuopio is inordinately proud of its unassuming 490-foot-tall hill, which boasts stunning vistas over a seemingly endless expanse of lakes and pine forests. The current and third incarnation of this tower atop the popular walkers’ paradise of Puijo Hill is a 246-foot-tall Brutalist behemoth. This tower was built in 1963 to replace a modest brick-built structure that was erected in 1900 to supplant the original three-story wooden tower built in 1856. It was designed by Finnish Architect Seppo Ruotsalainen and looms over a series of concrete ski-jumping hills. As well as being a delightful woodland eatery and imposing landmark of the city of Kuopio, the observation tower and rotating restaurant have a more practical use as a radio, television, and mobile telecom transmitter for the wider North Savonia region.  During the summer the observation tower opens at 10 a.m., with the restaurant opening at 11 a.m. Numerous nature trails exist in the forests around Puijo Hill.",brutalism towers restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars

Some 22 kilometres west of Helsinki, four teenagers, Maila Irmeli Björklund and Anja Tuulikki Mäki, both fifteen years old, and their eighteen-year-old boyfriends, Seppo Antero Boisman and Nils Wilhelm Gustafsson, decided to camp on the shore of the idyllic lake near the town of Espoo. Sometime between 4 and 6 a.m. three of them were brutally stabbed and bludgeoned to death. The fourth, Gustafsson, sustained a concussion, fractures to the jaw and facial bones, and bruises to the face, but survived.  In a state of shock, he claimed to have seen a apparition clad in black with bright red eyes. No murder weapons were retrieved from the site, though some of victims’ belongings were missing.  The murders shocked the nation, yet despite the intense police investigation the case remains unsolved to this day.  The Bodom murders never fully faded from memory and a series of suspects were interrogated over the years. Exactly 12 years after that night, unexpected news once again stirred the public’s attention. A man announced in his suicide note that he was the murderer. Karl Gyllström was working at the nearby Kiosk and hated the campers. However, his story was discarded as a cry for attention as police determined that he was asleep with his wife at the time of the murders. Wild theories begun to surface and the details of murders both real and conjured become a part of macabre local lore. One theory even involved a supposedly-deranged KGB spy. Dr. Jorma Palo, who had been working in the local hospital, claims to have treated a highly suspicious man for his injuries shortly after the murder. The man was the German-born Hans Assmann, allegedly a KGB agent. According to Dr. Palo, Mr. Assmann pretended to suffer from memory loss and was aggressive and nervous. However, Mr. Assmann too had a solid alibi.  Two local men, Pauli Luoma and Pentti Soininen were also considered suspects at different times. Finally, in March 2004 the story of the “Children of Bodom” took another turn. Nils Wilhelm Gustafsson, the only survivor, was arrested under suspicion of murdering his friends. According to the Police, enough new evidence was acquired through new investigative methods, unavailable at in 1960s, to indict Mr. Gustafsson, but in 2005 the court rejected the prosecution’s case and acquitted Mr. Gustafsson.

104,Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church,"Inari, Finland","This disused church, left to the elements of the Arctic Circle's forests is open for exploration.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pielpajarvi-wilderness-church,"One of the oldest buildings in northern Lapland, Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church (Pielpajärven erämaakirkko) was built in 1760 after the Christianization of the local people on the site of an old Sami winter village. Though still to this day, a principally migratory population known for coexistence alongside the herding of reindeer, the Sami people eventually abandoned their winter church at Pielpajärvi after troubles in procuring a priest for their services resulted in ceremonies to satisfy the devout lasting upwards of a week or more. The main center of worship for the Sami people’s believers was moved into the town of Inari itself for this highly practical reason, yet the old church remains standing in the silent depths of the north Lapland woods like a specter of an immutable spiritual past. Today, the church sits largely abandoned, surrounded by the forests of the Arctic Circle. It is used only one day each year, for a lone midsummer ceremony taking place at the site. Upon approach, it’s remarkable in what excellent condition the traditional interlocking woodwork of the church’s exterior remains. Though at first glance it will appear as if the church is perpetually closed to visitors, the opposite is in fact true; a gentle tug of its door opens the darkened interior, allowing for reverential exploration in one’s own time. Electricity is nonexistent, so a darkness from the forest seeping into the interior can be expected. Beyond treating the hallowed place with its proper respect, the key rule to keep in mind is to close the door upon exiting, thereby sealing out the elements and preserving Pielpajärvi for generations to come. The easiest way to reach the church is to hike from Inari village. The starting point of the trail is the Sarviniementie parking area, which is about 3km northeast of the Siida museum. From the parking area it's about a 5km hike through the woods to the church (route is marked with occasional signposts and more frequent red stakes).An alternative is to take the boat tour out to Ukko Island. After the stop at the island, when you're on the way back to Inari, ask the pilot to drop you off in Pielpavuono Bay (whether he'll be able to do this depends on the weather). From the bay, you can hike through the woods to the church (the route is also marked with red stakes), and from the church back to Inari village.",sami abandoned churches arctic circle migrations religion churches abandoned sacred spaces

106,Helsinki Observatory,"Helsinki, Finland",Finland's oldest astronomical observatory once played a crucial role in seafaring and timekeeping.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/helsinki-observatory,"When walking past the Helsinki city center, it’s hard to miss the large, beautiful building that stands at the top of the hill in the southern part of the city. It is slightly obscured by a row of old trees but nevertheless is an imposing structure that can be seen from all around the harbor. This building is not a palace, as you’d be forgiven for thinking, but actually used to be Finland’s main astronomical observatory. The Helsinki Observatory, part of the University of Helsinki, was built in 1831 and remained in use until 2010 when the university’s astronomy department was fused with the physics department. The structure is now open as a museum that showcases the history of astronomy in Finland, and its many beautiful telescopes. You might wonder why an observatory would have such a prominent spot in a capital city, especially so close to the harbor. This is because astronomy was, at the time, an indispensable part of seafaring. Astronomers would make star charts and almanacs, and test tools like sextants and compasses that would later be used by ships. Their knowledge of the stars is what kept ships sailing and allowed them to come home. Astronomy also played a crucial role in timekeeping, which was the main source of error when navigating the sea, making it a very serious business. The Helsinki Observatory marked the center of the Finnish meridian, and this location set the standard for Finnish time. The precise time of day would be communicated with ships by dropping a big red ball at exact hours. Ship captains would see the ball drop and adjust their clocks to that moment. The Helsinki Observatory was also the first observatory to implement an east-west structure with domes along its length, ensuring that one dome never obstructed another’s view of the sky. This was a novel approach at the time and one that was copied by Russia’s Pulkovo Observatory soon after, which in turn inspired the design of many European observatories after that.  The observatory museum is open from Thursday through Sunday.

The Soviets could invade, seemingly, at any moment. As a result, in 1940, Finland began the construction of Salpalinja (the “Salpa Line”), a system of more than 700 field fortifications made from concrete or excavated from rock along Finland’s eastern border. Stretching 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) from the Gulf of Finland in the south to modern-day Pechengsky, Russia, in the north, Salpalinja consisted of bunkers, trenches, fueling stations, weapons depots, and more. The line incorporated many lakes and marshes into its terrain, as these areas could be tough to navigate and easy to defend. Finished in 1944, Salpalinja was a mammoth project set to defend Finland against a possible Soviet invasion—only that invasion never came. Fast-forward to today, and Salpalinja sees more action from tour groups and urban explorers than it ever did in combat. Many of the features of the line still stand today, as they never endured any of the devastations of war. Along the line are multiple museums dedicated to its past and its bunkers, as well as tours that provide a great overview of its history. However, many bunkers, dugouts, and obstacles are buried deep in the forests, away from guided tours and foot traffic. These areas offer great experiences for those interested in a different or additional perspective from the various museums. The Ventovuori area in Virolahti offers numerous bunkers and systems to explore but it is still just a very small part of Salpalinja. Salpalinja was painstakingly built in the name of preparedness and defense, but today it remains only as a reminder of a history that never was, but could have been.  The address here is a good place to park, as the area is best traversed on foot. The winding dirt paths are often overgrown, but will lead to multiple bunkers, filling stations, caves, dugouts, and other derelict or collapsed structures. The bunkers can be quite wet and cold, but, above all else, they are very dark.

On the island of Hailuoto, this part of the culture is on full display. Completed in 1620, the original Hailuoto church held services for the small island population, primarily comprised of fishermen and farmers. That wooden church stood amidst the forests for over 300 years. Then in 1968, a fire ravaged the building, burning what was at that time the oldest wooden church in the country. While parts of the original structure were salvaged, the island needed a new place of worship. It got one in 1972, the first concrete and glass church of the Nordics. Items from the original church are on display inside, and none more prominent than the original frescoed wooden pulpit. From the pews, visitors are entrenched in the forests stretching out beyond the windows for the entirety of the church’s height. The surrounding nature is pulled into the church as an equal part of worship, a part Hailuoto strives to preserve for generations to come. After the service, visitors can walk through the forest cemetery behind the modern, concrete angles of the church. It’s beautiful and tranquil, standing in the middle of the Finnish forest.

It’s a welcoming place, a spot where anyone can escape the bitter cold with some warm, humid steam. But Sompasauna is also wonderfully unique. An outsider architecture project, it was built by the people for the people. The sauna has been dismantled and set aflame, but it’s always rebuilt, ensuring in-the-know locals and visitors alike will always have a ramshackle place of relaxation. The sauna is also entirely run by volunteers. It’s truly a community endeavor; an oasis where nude friends and strangers can romp around in the frigid Finland air while passing between the sauna and the nearby shore. Given its history of welcoming all who visit, its no wonder it’s been dubbed the country’s “most public sauna.” The sauna overlooks the sea, making for a soothing environment year-round. If you visit Sompasauna during the winter, you’ll have a chance to try another Finnish tradition: avanto, which means “ice swimming.” Even if you swing by during warmer months, the sea water will still be refreshingly cool, making for a nice change from the sweatiness of the sauna.  The sauna is open at all hours and is free to use. You can definitely wear a swimsuit if you'd feel more comfortable using the sauna while clothed.

But at this tri-country border, you can leap forward or backward two hours, depending on which border you cross. This strange construction happens because of Norway’s hook-like shape.

Proposed in 1982, the hill itself had to be built before the spiraling rows of trees could be planted. Once the land itself was built, the artist, Agnes Denes, enlisted 11,000 people from all across the globe to plant 11,000 trees in a specifically designed pattern. The pattern was designed to evoke ancient earthworks as well as the mathematical precision found in many of the works of the painting masters. The planting took place over four years from 1992 to 1996. With everything set to roll, the artist then let nature do its thing. The trees flourished on the reclaimed land, and by the early 2000s the intricate pattern was beginning to show as though it had occurred naturally. Announced at the 1992 Earth Summit, the environmental art project is intended to help alleviate the world’s ecological stress. The Finnish government has pledged to protect and maintain it for 400 years.

112,Imatrankoski,"Imatra, Finland",These Finnish rapids have been attracting tourists for over a hundred years and are now released with the push of a button.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/imatrankoski,"Rushing through a shallow Finnish hollow the Imatrankoski rapids have been a popular tourist attraction for about as long as they have been known, but today, thanks to a massive power plant dam, the rapids are only unleashed according to a show schedule. Formed over 5,000 years ago when ancient lake waters reshaped the landscape, the rapids are arguably the largest such feature in the country. Given their violent grandeur, it is little surprise that they quickly began attracting attention. As early as the late 1700s the rapids were luring vacationers and gawking naturalists in equal number. As the number of visitors to the raging waters grew, a cable car was installed that would ferry people over the deadly torrent in a bit of thrilling novelty. Hotels and other indicators of a burgeoning tourist economy also began to appear in the vicinity. As opposed to doubling down on the attractions at the site, a massive hydroelectric dam was built across the river in the 20th century.

From one side it just looks like an ordinary rock. But if you walk around to the other side, you’ll spot a familiar face. The Groke (Mörkö in Finnish, Mårran in Swedish) is a fictional character from Finnish author Tove Jansson’s Moomin stories. She’s a mysterious ghost-like character who leaves a trace of ice behind her wherever she goes. Moomin is a part of Finnish identity, and this piece of outsider art pays tribute to the rich fantasy world Jansson has created. The Oulu Groke is a beloved character in the city, and on a few occasions, Finnish hockey fans have come to her to celebrate World Cup victories.

114,Lake Lappajärvi,"Lappajärvi, Finland",Nuclear waste experts study this prehistoric crater lake to envision landscapes one million years in the future.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-lappajarvi,"About 77 million years ago, a meteorite crashed into what is now Finland’s Southern Ostrobothnia region. Today, serene Lake Lappajärvi rests in the approximately 14-mile wide crater crafted during the wake of this blast from the distant past. Locals still enjoy boating to Kärnänsaari, an island formed by the impact’s melt rock. Paddling there is an encounter with the landscape’s deep history. While visiting the lake—one of the largest crater lakes in Europe—you can hunt around for bits of Kärnäiitti, a rare rock that was formed by the meteorite’s impact. People looking for some aquatic exercise can join the locals who paddleboat, canoe, and swim across its surface. There are also many walking trails that line its picturesque shores. The deep, long history of Lake Lappajärvi has also attracted a very different kind of visitor, safety experts from a radioactive waste management company building an underground repository for spent nuclear fuel in Western Finland. The experts are tasked with predicting how the nuclear waste’s radioactivity, if it were to be somehow released from the repository someday, would interact with the region’s rocks, groundwater, ecosystems, and populations in the extreme long-term, many millennia from now. Most commonly they use computer models to assess how the waste repository might endure or degrade in the far future. But they also develop more speculative, quirky approaches in a report called Complimentary Considerations that is basically a hodgepodge of scientific evidence and PR tools aimed at persuading people of the facility’s safety. This is where Lake Lappajärvi comes in. The report explains how the crater lake kept its form throughout numerous past Ice Age glaciation and post-Ice Age de-glaciation periods. After looking into the environment’s past, safety assessment experts speculated we can expect only limited erosion and landmass movement throughout the repository’s multimillion-year futures. Lappajärvi’s deep histories are, in this way, taken as windows into the deep future. Visions of far future worlds can emerge from analogies across time—extrapolating from long pasts to reckon long futures. This Finnish lake is one place where this creative approach to far future planning is taking place. Visiting landscapes like Lake Lappajärvi can help researchers adopt the long-termist mentality necessary for thinking more clearly about climate change, biodiversity, sustainability, nuclear waste, or even human extinction.",deep time meteorites long now locations time nuclear environment lakes water history

116,Tampere Cathedral Frescoes,"Tampere, Finland",The church's remarkable frescoes incorporate Finnish artist Hugh Simberg's trademark themes of death and the supernatural.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tampere-cathedral-frescoes,"The frescoes and paintings inside the Tampere Cathedral in Finland, created by Finnish symbolist painter Hugo Simberg in the early 1900s, are a national treasure, incorporating his trademark themes of mortality and the supernatural. Simberg was fascinated by the idea that death and decay are all around us. One of the recurring images he included in his work was a skeleton wearing a black cape. Though viewers at the time initially found the symbols and figures in his work odd and disturbing, they slowly grew accustomed to Simberg’s style. He was commissioned to decorate the interiors of the new cathedral in Tampere, being built in 1902, at the height of Finland’s National Romantic movement at the turn of the century. At the time, there was much opposition to the policy of Russification, and the Finnish asserted their identity through art and architecture. This is beautifully depicted at Tampere Cathedral (then called St John’s church), which is adorned with stained glass work, frescoes, and paintings. The most famous are Simberg’s macabre frescoes. On the upper floor you can see “The Wounded Angel,” voted Finland’s national painting in 2006. It depicts two boys, one of whom looks directly at the viewer, carrying a bandaged angel on a stretcher. “The Garden of Death” can be seen on the ground floor near the altar. According to a note by the artist on the back of his initial sketch, it depicts “the place where dead people end up before entering heaven.” The skeletons have an almost kindly appearance as they tend to the plants in the nursery. The most controversial of Simberg’s creations for the church was the serpent holding an apple in its mouth, which decorates the highest point of the ceiling. This was viewed as a symbol of corruption and sin and his critics termed it unsuitable for a church and called for its removal. Even as late as 1946, there was a proposal by the bishop of the Tampere diocese that it be removed. Know before you go: The cathedral is open daily but hours are often restricted due to its popularity for weddings and baptismals. The upper part of the cathedral is closed for general visiting, however if you ask politely you may be allowed to go upstairs to look more closely at 'The Wounded Angel'.",paintings death churches sacred spaces art architecture

Huddling close to one another where the Gulf of Finland meets the Baltic Sea, the islands are separated by a narrow strait that is home to a unique collection of graffiti stretching back over half a millennium. Pike’s Gut (“Hauensuoli” in Finnish) has served for centuries as a safe haven for seamen awaiting good weather conditions or favorable winds. Sometimes, however, the wait could last for weeks, so to pass the time the sailors came ashore and carved farewell notes, their names and coats of arms on the rocky faces of these islands. The oldest dates back to the 15th century, though most of the extent carvings are from the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time the word spread about this “guest book of the archipelago”, attracting even more people to visit and add their own marks. Over 600 such carvings have been identified. Due to exposure to the elements and the considerable age of the graffiti, the markings have worn off and are not easy to see. In 1967 the local community was called to donate their used toothbrushes so the rocks could be cleaned of lichen and dirt. Later the lines were filled with dark color so the markings would be more visible. Nearby shipwrecks also speak to the location’s significance as a cultural and historical site. It is a protected area under Finland’s Antiquities Act and is under the care of the National Board of Antiquities. Regular trips to the island are arranged only in July and August (limited departures). Check Hanko tourism information website for more information and booking.

They left their home and livelihood by the sea, fled to mainland Finland, and found a safe place in the municipality of Kittilä. As a compensation for the lost property, the state of Finland gave the Raekallio family a small piece of forest. The family spent decades growing the forest and grooming it for timber. But when the time came to cut down the trees, Kaarle, now known as “Pappa,” the grandfather of the Raekallio family, was no longer willing. Instead, he offered up his beloved Lappish pines for adoption by “tree-huggers” from around the world. Nowadays, the HaliPuu (Finnish for “hugging tree”) forest is a peaceful place that unites nature lovers regardless of their physical location. Situated about six miles (10km) from Levi, a known vacation destination in Finnish Lapland, it is a hidden oasis where one can truly experience the essence of the Arctic woodland, and help to protect it. The adoption period for each tree is five years, during which time the owners are free to come visit the Pappa’s forest and their personal little piece of it. Those that can’t make the trip come and hang out with the Raekallio family on their live-broadcasts on Periscope.

From bone and wood carvings—to cave paintings and petroglyphs, these remnants are sometimes our only insight into the lives of these ancient cultures. Unfortunately, many of these places have faded over the years. Especially across Europe, where the wet climate is an enemy of preservation efforts. Those that do survive are priceless windows into the past. Not far from the shores of lake Yövesi is one such place. A large collection of over 70 paintings from over five millennia ago still adorn various rocks. Archaeologists believe that the location is a shamanistic ritual site, where hunting rituals were depicted to guarantee future hunts remained fruitful. The site contains roughly 20 pictures of moose, around nine boats, several hands, animal tracks, and about 20 people in various stances. There also appears to be a few dogs and fish depicted. The drawings focus mostly on the moose, with a few containing dots near their hearts. Another interesting image is that of a female hunter, a rare find in ancient rock art.

He first acquired the land in 1954, not by purchasing the property, but by bartering with the previous owner. During the day, he worked for the plotter, but in the evenings he crafted and constructed his visionary home. Constructed entirely of repurposed and recycled scrap materials, Elis set out to create a welcoming villa suitable for parties and guests from his artistic circles. Near the trailhead are two buildings, a small guest room and, in Finnish tradition, a sauna. But further along the path stands his greatest labor of love. Behind the now rusted fence are more buildings, including Elis’s home, a multi-story guest house, a sauna, communal spaces, beehives, and an impressive bee tower. In the middle of all this is a small pond originally crafted to collect rainwater, but is now the resting spot for the artist’s ashes. In 2004, Elis died leaving behind a quiet debate over what to do with Villa Mehu. Despite being relatively unattended since his death, the buildings have preserved well in their inevitable struggle against nature. There are no clear signs of vandalism, and visitors pay their respects to the artistic home Elis left behind still filled with old clothes, newspaper clippings, toys, photographs, magazines, and daily supplies. In life, Elis wanted to share his dancing and art with all who cared to see. In death, that art and his memory live on at Villa Mehu.

But the zoo’s real highlight is its polar bears, which happen to be the only ones who live in Finland. The zoo is home to Venus and Manse, two polar bears who make a lovely couple. Over the years, the pair has had a few cubs—a feat that’s rare for polar bears in captivity. Because of the high-quality living conditions, most of their cubs survive into adulthood and are sent to other zoos. Venus and Manse’s most recent cub was born in 2017. The bear family is part of the European Endangered Species Program (EEP), a breeding program for endangered animals kept in captivity. While at Ranua Wildlife Park, you’ll want to be sure to see more than the polar bears. The zoo, which opened in 1983 as a “wilderness zoo,” is a mix between a wildlife sanctuary and a zoo. Its main goal is to keep a cross-section of all Finnish animals, especially the Arctic ones and endangered species, in their own natural environment. There are about 50 species of wildlife in the park, ranging from beautiful snowy owls to a wolf pack and a variety of bears. The whole park is built into the forest. A long wooden bridge allows you to walk around and observe the animals.  The park is open all year with special activities in the summer. There are holiday apartments, a restaurant, a café, a wine shop, and a grocery store in the area. There are no lights in the zoo, so if you arrive after sundown (which is around noon in the winter), you need to bring a torch or rent one from the ticket shop.",bears zoos wildlife animals
123,Turku Cathedral,"Turku, Finland",A cathedral resurrected from the ashes of one of Europe's greatest urban fires.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/turku-cathedral,"In 1827 a firestorm raged through the Finnish city of Turku, annihilating everything in its path. Sweeping through the northern quarter, the southern quarter, and then hopping the Aura River towards the Cathedral Quarter just before midnight, the Great Fire of Turku made short work of the Nordic city, the largest in Finland at the time. When daylight finally arrived, 75% of the formerly bustling metropolis had been reduced to smoldering ruins. With only small portions of the western and southern areas still standing, it was miraculous that only 27 people perished, however the reason the casualties were so low was also one of the contributing factors to the level of destruction accomplished by the fire. Along with unusually dry weather and high winds, the reason the inferno was able to sweep so efficiently through the city was that the majority of the residents of Turku were in Tampere visiting a popular market—there was no one there to extinguish the flames. While the survival rate was high, the historical and architectural loss was devastating. Akatemiatalo, the main building of the Imperial Academy of Turku was heavily damaged, the fire swallowing up most of the Finnish archives and all of the material from the Middle Ages. Historical downtown was a pile of smoldering embers, and the grandiose Mother Church of the Lutherans of Finland, Turku Cathedral, was ravaged—but the most important religious structure in the country would rise once more. Located in the heart of Turku, the wooden cathedral was built in the 13th century, and fortified with stone in the 14th and 15th centuries. After the fire, the cathedral was resurrected, bigger and better than ever before. Elaborate Romantic-style frescos, three organs, and an altarpiece by Swedish artist Fredrik Westin depicting the Transfiguration of Jesus are all newer features of the cathedral. Perhaps the most impressive addition is the tower spire that can be seen for miles—its height measures in at 101 meters above sea level. The Great Fire of Turku remains the most disastrous urban fire in the history of all of the Nordic countries, and the Turku Cathedral remains as well, a symbol of the endurance of the oldest city in Finland.

124,Lenin Museum,"Tampere, Finland",The last permanent exhibit dedicated to the Soviet leader.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lenin-museum,"During the mid-20th century, a handful of museums dedicated to Vladimir Lenin could be seen around Europe, but the only permanent Lenin museum that remains today is the one in Tampere, Finland. The location of the small museum is especially significant: It’s situated in the Tampere Workers’ Hall, the very same place where Lenin and Stalin met for the first time in a secret meeting of the Bolsheviks in December 1905. The building hosted underground meetings of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1905 and 1906. It was here that Lenin and Stalin started planning a revolution which later changed world history. After the signed peace treaty between Finland and the USSR in 1944, the political climate in Finland changed and began favoring friendly relations between the countries. Accordingly, the Finland-Soviet Society was founded. The Tampere branch of the society took the initiative of establishing a Lenin Museum in this hall. The idea received widespread support among politicians, as they considered improving the post-war relations between the countries an essential task. Stalin was also pleased about the museum. The endorsement from him greatly increased the initiative’s prestige and significance. The museum became a politically vital project in the improvement of Finno-Soviet relations. The Lenin Museum was opened on January 20, 1946, a day before the 22nd anniversary of Lenin’s death. It was the first museum dedicated to Lenin outside the Soviet Union. Unlike other Lenin museums, it was not operated by a Communist party. It’s possible to get a grasp of the political significance of the museum by looking at the list of Soviet leaders who visited the museum during the Cold War. In 2014 the Lenin Museum became a part of the Finnish Labour Museum Werstas. At present, the space has a permanent exhibition with materials related to Lenin’s life, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and the shared past of the two countries. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the museum underwent a complete renovation to show a more comprehensive picture of Soviet rule. A scaled model of Stalin’s gulag camp reminds visitors of the years of terror whereas a Soviet joke jukebox will make them laugh.

Over time, running water removed the softer stone and left the harder gneiss stone intact, creating a geological phenomenon known as tafoni. The rock is Finland’s second largest tafone specimen. The resulting formation—a giant rock about 17 feet long and 10 feet tall—looks uncannily like the head of a troll or some other grotesque being. It’s almost as if the giant head gazes toward the lake, scanning the landscape it guards. When the Sami people still lived in this area, they worshiped the rock as a Sieidi, a sacrificial stone. When Christianity arrived, the stone was thought to harbor the home of Saint Nicholas himself. The stone is located in a small natural conservation area next to the beautiful Lake Kulovesi. It’s a bit hard to find, but once you discover it, you can actually crawl into its holes to get an inside view of the Devil’s Nest. There, you can see the stone’s honeycomb-like formations. Because it’s possible to access the inside of the giant rock, it’s even considered a cave.  The road ends almost 500 yards from the stone.

On New Year’s Day in 1905, a newly constructed steamship became the latest vessel to succumb to the shallow waters. In 1906, construction on a lighthouse to aid travel along the trade route began in haste. In a mere nine months, the lighthouse was erected and composed of granite and bricks. It was lit for the first time on December 19, 1906. Workers and their families who remained in the area maintained the lighthouse and worked in shifts handling the light and foghorns. The wives tended to the living quarters and taught the children in a small school. When World War II erupted, Finland was forced to defend Bengtskär. The island’s location not only served well for guiding ships through the labyrinth of islands, but it also was a safeguard from attacks by way of the Gulf of Finland. It’s importance led to Russia launching an invasion of the island. Approximately 35 Finnish soldiers were stationed on the island. When the invasion began, the radio operator on the island called for support. Within minutes, the coastal artillery team began firing. Within hours, navy ships and planes converged on Bengtskär. When the battle was over, the Finns had secured the island. The next day, Soviet forces bombed the lighthouse. When it was all said done, and the Soviet Union pulled out from the Hanko region and Finland regained control of its lands and water. About 32 Finnish soldiers and 60 Russian soldiers were killed in the short Battle of Bengtskär. After the war, the lighthouse was mostly left to deteriorate. Restoration efforts did not begin until 1992. It took three years to renovate the structure. In 1995, the island opened as a museum to the lighthouse and its wartime history. The old apartments in which the lighthouse keepers and their families lived have been converted into hotel rooms. Deep window seals running up along the spiraling, steel staircase contain small exhibits and artifacts paying homage to the island’s dramatic past. A military bunker and other war relics can still be explored on the island.  Boats can be arranged to visit the island from Kasnäs during the summer months. If you wish to explore the old military bunker at Bengtskär, it's recommended to bring a flashlight or headlamp.

Knitting is also extremely popular in Finland, so the combination of that and heavy metal might not be as far-fetched as it might first seem. The organizers of the competition argue that they are both creative activities, which naturally brings them together.

128,Märket Lighthouse,"Hammarland, Finland",A long-disputed lighthouse built on the wrong side of a Finnish/Swedish island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/market-lighthouse,"The Märket Lighthouse was a highly contentious little prize. In the late 19th-century, Finland decided it needed a lighthouse on a tiny, uninhabited island in the Baltic Sea called Märket. Divided between what is now Finland and Sweden, the treacherous island had contributed to the sinking of eight ships in the year 1873 alone, all of which had overcorrected their courses in order to avoid her rocky shores. The czar in St. Petersburg eventually had enough (Finland was still part of the Russian Empire at this point), and in 1885 ordered the young, soon-to-be-famous Finnish architect Georg Schreck to build a lighthouse on Märket. Schreck and his crew started the construction on the highest point of the island (10 feet above sea level), which was the spot least likely to be affected by the waves and ice. This spot happened to be on the Swedish side of the border, but that didn’t stop them. Even though it was officially on Swedish soil, the Finns wouldn’t give up their nautical achievement, and lit and manned their lighthouse anyway. Tensions flared between the two Nordic countries, and eventually they came to a mutually palatable decision: to redraw the island’s boundaries into a haphazard Z-shape. In 1985, the lighthouse became officially reattached to Finnish territory on the island by a thin stretch of land. Still, after all that land reassignment and finagling, you’d think that Finland would treat the lighthouse a bit better. The lighthouse, unmanned since 1977, fell into disrepair, and Finnish preservationists are trying to raise money for its care. Since 2007 volunteers spend summers at the island repairing and showing visitors around. Still, it’s easy to see why the lighthouse is both difficult and dangerous to maintain. Märket Island is still treacherous. The windy and portless skerry is only accessible if one navigates through the shallow, rocked-filled shore of one side of the island or steers through the deeper side on a limited number of low-wind days. Perhaps the now-crumbling lighthouse wasn’t worth the fuss, after all.  There are tours leaving Käringsunds Guest Harbor every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday during the summer. The boat ride to Märket is around an hour and 2-3 hours are spent there. The tours can be canceled due to bad weather since this is one of the windiest places in Finland.

A few months later, Leppänen decided to rent the old Gasthaus Ranua that had been serving its customers in different roles since the 1940s. The Guesthouse itself was constructed after World War II as a bed and breakfast. The building has been active ever since and still includes plenty of interesting older details. The reinforcements of the main building’s foundations are composed of rifle barrels used during the wars. The second main building, with single and double rooms, once served as a warehouse for the submarine that was once purchased as a tourist attraction on the property. Over the decades, the old Guesthouse building served as a gas station, bank, kiosk, and shop. Many of the indoor facilities were renovated, but its old-world charm was left intact. Eventually, Leppänen made the decision to install a new feature at the Guesthouse that would blend the traditional with the modern. He decided to contact AuroraHut and several glass igloos were installed along the property. Glass Igloos had become a vital part of tourism in Lapland during the previous years. But the idea was not to mimic what everybody else was doing, but to give his guest the ability to stay anywhere on the property. These glass igloos are easily moved from one place to another during the year. In the summer months, the igloos use their own engines in the back of the dome, and during the winter season, they can be pulled atop the frozen lake. It’s a great way to view the Northern Lights.

Standing tall on a remote rock in the Gulf of Finland, the elegant-looking beacon is one of 14 brick lighthouses in the Baltic country, and one of just three with a octagonal shape. The eight-sided lighthouse was completed in 1862, but construction was not without its challenges. The plans had called for the tower to be built from granite, but just 26 feet up, the supply ran out. The rest of the lighthouse was thus built with common bricks—and the harsh Finnish weather was quick to expose flaws in this construction. The relentless winds proved able to sway the brick lighthouse several inches quite easily. As a result, between 1912 and 1917, the structure was fitted and stabilized with an iron corset, a combination of iron bars, bands, and concrete. The life of a lighthouse keeper has never been a glamorous one, and life on the lighthouse island (majakkasaari) of Sōderskār was no exception. There were few ships to connect the island with nearby Helsinki and Porvoo, making for long, isolated winters. But in traditional Finnish fashion, the island’s sauna was completed in 1876, a full 44 years before the lighthouse masters’ quarters were completed. While the lighthouse keepers tended to their work, the masters served as head of operations as well as the primary educators of the keepers’ families. The tiny island housed the lighthouse operators and their families for the next 75 years until the beacon was automated in the 1950s.

131,Mattolaituri,"Helsinki, Finland",This restaurant combines two Finnish traditions in one place: warm-weather relaxation and outdoor carpet-cleaning.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mattolaituri,"The city of Helsinki, which is located as far north as Alaska, cherishes its long and fleeting summer days. On the coast of the Baltic Sea, an unusual restaurant and wine bar combines two of the city’s traditions: warm-weather relaxation and outdoor carpet-cleaning. Carpet washing piers, known as mattolaiturit, dot the seafront of the Finnish capital. They are the urban variant of a longstanding tradition in Finland: washing laundry in rural lakes. Today, Finns still practice the custom, bringing household carpets to these special washing stations with pine oil soap. They wash their rugs, rinse them in seawater, and hang them over the piers to dry in the sun while they enjoy the rest of the day. The restaurant and wine bar Mattolaituri, which opened in 2011, is next to one of the city’s most popular carpet washing piers. The chic, minimal design of the cafe makes for a modernity-meets-nostalgia vibe that helps explain its popularity. During the day, people stop by after a jog, or midway through a dog walk, for a cup of coffee and a korvapuusti, or Finnish cinnamon bun. The brunch crowd likes the spacious seafront terrace. In the evening, revelers might enjoy the midnight sun with bubbly, a DJ, and a swim off the pier. At any time of day, the unmistakable scent of pine soap wafts in from the pier and mingles with the perfume of champagne.",bars restaurants

It’s internationally renowned for its distinct Brutalist architecture and is one of the most important works completed in this style in Finland. The building is a favorite among filmmakers and photographers. In 2020, it was featured on the Swedish show Advokaten. The building has a long history with media production, being home to a large television studio inaugurated by the Mayor of Helsinki in 1976. In 1978, the studio produced the first subscription-based TV channel in Europe, and in 1982, the building became the first place in Europe to relay satellite broadcasts to a cable network. Finnish telecom operator DNA was founded in the building as Helsingin Kaapelitelevisio. Today, they continue to maintain a large presence inside. The building contains 12 floors. Its load-bearing structure is entirely composed of concrete rather than prefabricated materials, an unusual sight in Finland. The 30 pilotis that the building’s residential wing sits atop are striking and draw comparisons to the work of Le Corbusier. The large satellite dishes on the roof of the residential tower have become a local landmark. Besides the TV studio, the building hosts 60 flats, a grocery store, a data center, offices, restaurants, and a self-storage facility. A lesser-known area of the building can be found underneath Opastinsilta, just down the ramp from Asemapäällikönkatu toward the K-Market loading dock on the right. Under Opastinsilta is a cathedral of cast concrete with unique lighting and acoustics. It’s a popular place to take photos and has been featured in several music videos. Asemapäällikönhovi is located in the district of Eastern Pasila.",television buildings history & culture architecture

Each year, the world’s most proficient masters of the imaginary electric guitars work their way through a series of international competitions with hopes of competing at the Air Guitar World Championships. Since 1996, the stage at Oulu, Finland has been home to an epic showdown of rock-and-roll enthusiasm, where, by definition, style triumphs over substance. Though it seems like a farce, the rules are quite strict and share a scoring system oddly similar to that of figure skating. Competitors must perform two separate routines: the first lasting 60 seconds, consisting of music of their choice, followed by a second, surprise selection of music assigned by festival organizers. Dress code is nonexistent, and self-expression is seen as a crucial element of the performance aspect. Judges consist of music critics, media personalities, and second-tier musicians, all tasked with docking competitors who slip into air-drumming or anything that may fall outside the strict confines of the guitar. Whether participants choose to channel the acoustic or electric is left up to their discretion. In the competition’s early years, nearly all the winners were Finnish, though recent years have drawn an ever increasing international crowd of spectators and participants, making this spectacle a truly mind-blowing experience… for it all being illusory.",festivals music

The city’s sports center has hosted multiple Nordic sporting championships and events, where thousands of people brave the frigid Scandinavian temperatures to watch agile skiers soar down three looming artificial hills. However, locals know it’s worth sticking around in the warmer months, too. The ski jump tower, which is a star attraction in the winter, is open even when not covered in layers of snow. In fact, the public actually has better access during the summer than it does in the winter. In the summer, an open-air swimming pool appears at the base of the jump tower. According to most, it’s the only ski jump tower in the world to boast such a seasonal feature. Families can swim and relax while splashing about in the shadows of the tallest hill. Visitors who would rather stay dry can still ride a chairlift up to the site, where they can drink in the views of the surrounding scenery while being transported through the pleasant summer air. Once there, they can then take an elevator to the observation deck at the top of the 380-foot tall structure, which offers panoramic views of the city and distant nature. During the summer, you can buy the swimming pool ticket or cable car ticket from the sports center's entrance. During the winter, you can bring your own cross country skiing gear to ski around the complex (entrance is free but depends on the snow conditions).",ski pools winter towers sports
136,'Oma maa mansikka',"Helsinki, Finland",This ten-ton fruit sculpture celebrates the Finland homeland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oma-maa-mansikka,"Standing proudly outside an extension to the Finnish Parliament building is an oversized steel strawberry patch. In 2005, the Finnish Parliament commissioned six pieces of artwork to decorate the new Finnish Parliament Annex, also known as “Little Parliament.” Out of 1,719 competition entries, this design by Finnish artist Jukka Lehtinen was chosen as the only one visible to the public outside of the building. It is located in front of the annex next to a pool. The planting basin that the sculpture is mounted in has wild strawberries growing around the sculpture’s base, contrasting the fragile nature of natural strawberries with the robust welded metalwork of the oversized strawberries of the sculpture. The piece is named “Oma maa mansikka.“ The name derives from a well-known Finnish expression meaning “my land’s a strawberry, other land’s a blueberry.” Which is a metaphor that symbolizes Finnish pride for their homeland. The occurrence of wild strawberries growing on land has for a long time in Finland been an indication of land ownership. Land management and agricultural practices of felling forests and burning the land to transform it into farmland creates good ground for wild strawberries. The nine plant stem construction is a little over nine feet (3.5 meters) tall high and the two strawberries weigh over 200 pounds (100 kilograms) each. Strict calculations were made during the design and construction phase to ensure that the sculpture can withstand the elements. The sculpture was made by the company Homlet Oy, who specializes in making steel structures.",fruit sculptures art

It is situated on Pukkisaari, a tiny island in Seurasaarenselkä Bay in Helsinki. The village was built in 1999 by Sommelo ry, a non-profit organization dedicated to the research of Finnish Iron Age history. It is a faithful reproduction of a typical trading settlement from the first millennia. The buildings on Pukkisaari are not restorations of specific buildings that once stood here, but rather representations of the construction techniques used in Finland and nearby areas at the end of the Iron Age. There is a large house with a central stove, a small cooking hut made out of thin spruce logs, a workshop, and more.  The place is accessible via a wooden causeway that branches off from the path leading to the larger Seurasaari island and open-air museum.

It was built to withstand the weight of a car—though not because it’s in the middle of a road. The clock is embedded in the floor of a shopping mall in northern Finland, so it’s more likely to be tromped upon by pedestrians’ feet. The illuminated clock consists of 60 segments placed in a circle. The individual pieces can be turned on or off to indicate the time down to the second. The wider pieces go dark to indicate the hour, and there’s a black line to show where 12:00 is. It’s possible to change the color of each individual segment, allowing for a seemingly endless array of appearances. In addition to being able to survive heavy loads, the clock’s placement means it has to endure other elements, too. It must withstand the water used to clean the floor, as well as snow dripping off boots during the winter months. And, because people walk over it every day, it’s important that the glass doesn’t get too slippery.

The apocalyptic feel of a place that used to be a nest of joy, laughter, and amusement park rides closed down in 2015 and has since been vandalized and left for nature to take its place. But in 2021, a volunteer-run project took over and invited over a hundred artists to paint the walls, rooms, pillars, and even the trash cans. Now almost 200 artists have taken part in the project, including international crews like 1 UP, and the premises, even though slowly deteriorating, are a burst of color. The area is vast, consisting of a large outdoor space and multiple buildings. Apart from murals and graffiti, there are also installations and photography on display. People who have visited the amusement park as a child describe the re-visit as “trippy.” The premises are to be taken down at some point, so see it while you can!

Inside, visitors are free to explore the romantic industrial building and enter a long brick oven designed in 1930. The once-mighty factory is open for visitors during the summer, when it operates as a museum, cultural center, and bar hosting live music, theater, and art exhibitions. The founding location of the factory was no accident as the land is rich in clay and was located along the very first railway line in Finland. The factory quickly grew and needed more workers. Just after one year of production, the area got its own railway stop and the small town of Jokela was born. The factory dug their own clay from the soil around the factory. Visitors can still see many small ponds around the town born from the digging of clay.  Easy access by train just 30 minutes from the capital Helsinki.

Its bronze body is adorned with boughs and branches. This six-foot metallic child is Branch Boy (“Oksapoika” in Finnish), the centerpiece of a bizarre folkloric sculpture trail. Branch Boy’s feet are sunk into the sidewalk, or perhaps just missing, and he appears to have mislaid at least one of his hands. By following the direction of the sculpture’s empty-socketed gaze, eagle-eyed observers may spot a second part of this odd sculpture trail. Branch Boy seems to be watching a pair of  fairy-like representations of the ancient Finnish Sun and Moon goddesses, Kuutar and Päivätär, frozen in an eternal chase around a nearby lamppost. The goddesses have no heads, nor any other body parts to speak of, being represented simply by tiny bronze dresses. On a bench behind Branch Boy, a six-inch-tall, stick-limbed chrome gnome on a plinth looks like a left-behind award for Best Mythological Creature. Elsewhere on Kauppakatu Street, bronze rye bread dangles from a lamppost and abandoned bronze shoes lie like litter under a bench. These strangely entertaining sculptures are the work of Finnish artist Pekka Kauhanen. Erected in 2013 following the pedestrianization of Kauppakatu, a thoroughfare leading from Finland’s largest city square, the sculptures are intended to be humorous nods to the woodland legends of Savonian mythology. Branch Boy himself bears his bough-like appendages in reference to Kuopio’s intimate connection with the woody wilderness on its doorstep.  Branch Boy is situated on the corner of Kauppakatu, and Kuopio's Market Place, close to the pretty market hall. To find the goddesses, follow his gaze. The coordinates given are for Branch Boy himself; the other sculptures are to be hunted along the pedestrianised length of Kauppakatu.",mythology sculptures statues

For much of its history, this tiny island served as a naval outpost. In the 19th century, Lonna was home to production and storage facilities. Up until 1955, it served as a demagnetizing station. Floating magnetic mines were a devastating weapon of maritime warfare against ships with metallic hauls. The demagnetization method was developed as a way to counter these mines. The process itself involved wrapping the vessel with electric cables and running the high-powered current for about six to eight hours. During World War II, Finnish and German warships would stop by once a month for this procedure. The diesel generators used for this purpose can still be seen on Lonna. The island of Lonna was turned to civilian use in 2014. The old military structures have been converted into a restaurant, cafe, conference venue, and of course a sauna.

But as her work progressed, her message became obscured by a sizable statuary herd of elk, penguins, horses and swans. Alhoranta decided to begin creating her sculpture garden out of passion, and to prove that women could create large installations. Working to advance feminism by attacking the idea that men are the builders of our species, she set about making life-sized animal statues created out of wood, concrete, and a little help from her trusty chainsaw. After working tirelessly, she had finally created a few horses, dogs and other smaller animals, along with her pride and joy, the elk. All totaled, Alhoranta created eight elk, and was almost always photographed stroking their noses as one would pet a small lap dog. Besides her work on the statues, Alhoranta also paints during the cold, winter months and creates totems on her property in Finland.",outsider art statues

The station’s architecture is a huge draw, but these magnificent figures are worthy of a visit in their own right, for the purist value of the art as well as the often amusing adornments that they wear from time to time. Designed by Emil Wickström, the Lyhdynkantajat, or Lantern Bearers, have graced the front of the building, two on either side of the entrance, since 1914, apart from an absence for restoration in 2013. Each figure holds two almost spherical lighting globes which are illuminated at night. Above the waist, these figures have a muscular torso, but their legs are replaced by stone columns in a style reminiscent of the art of Egypt and Assyria. Each of the Finnish granite figures were copied from the same plaster original, which was said to have been modeled on a Finish peasant named Jalmari Lehtinen. These figures are very popular and have been featured in a number of advertising campaigns. They have been adorned with medical face masks in support of Covid-19 precautions, and in athletic garb in support of the Finnish football team, with the lanterns disguised as soccer balls. Parodies of the figures are even used to support the railing of the monorail track in a nearby theme park. In 2017, Lyhdynkantajat wore face masks to advertise a Kiss concert in the city. The state railway also used images of the four figures in an advertising campaign  in which the figures have legs and go by the alternative, popular name of Kivimiehet, or “The Stone Men.” The drawings of the figures are featured in locations throughout Finland, including several cities and Sápmi, or Lapland, as a means of encouraging tourism by rail.",advertising train stations sculptures statues

It was first consecrated as an Eastern Orthodox garrison church for Russian troops stationed at the sea fortress that was located on the island. In 1918, the Orthodox church was converted into an Evangelical Lutheran church. The conversion was undertaken during a period when Finland was trying to assert its new-found independence from Russia. During extensive renovations, a more Western design was incorporated into the layout of the church, such as the removal of the onion domes of the four smaller towers. A competition ran to find the design for the church, this was won by architect Einar Sjöström. The redesigned church was reconsecrated in April 1929, but there was now something rather different about the building. The church’s central dome was redesigned into a lighthouse. Initially, a gaslight was installed to provide light for the beacon, but today this has been converted to electricity. The church tower continues to function as a lighthouse for both air and sea traffic today.

Just three kilometers from the center of the city, the collection of villas still struggle against elements and time. Kruunuvuori came into existence in the late 19th century, when Laajasalo and all of eastern Helsinki were just fields and forests. The stunning coastline and lush forest made it a paradise. In 1900, German businessman Albert Goldbeck-Löwen acquired the area and developed it into a resort for the upper classes and the wealthy Germans who lived in Helsinki, but over time it became available to the middle class masses as well. After WWII, as part of the armistice between Germany and the Soviet Union, Kruunuvuori fell into the hands of the Communist Party of Finland and became a holiday resort for its members. In 1955 employer Aarne J. Aarnio took ownership of the area with the lofty idea of turning it into a residential area for thousands of people. Of course, the villas still belonged to their former owners and while the community remained vibrant and active for a while, a feeling of uncertainty began to creep in and maintenance of buildings was soon being neglected. Zoning laws hindered the construction plans, and their negative successive building permit made Aarnio lost interest in the project. Silently, the decadence faded, and decay began to seize the mountain. The Crown Mountain is a mysterious place, ideally seen and experienced in person. Amongst the woods and fog stands this beautifully sad monument, a decaying memory of the old glory days of the aristocracy and high bourgeoisie that still resists the ravages of wind, snow and builders without scruples.  The path that leads to Kruunuvuori starts at the end of Paatie Street, on the western end of Laajasalo.

155,Tire Gorilla,"Helsinki, Finland",A giant gorilla made of used car tires used to sit sentinel over a Helsinki college campus.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tire-gorilla,"Sitting with the serene posture of a zen master on the campus of Helsinki University’s Viikki campus is one of the more unique animals to ever grace a university quad: a massive gorilla figure made entirely of automobile tires known as, Everything is Possible. The huge piece of art is the work of Finnish artist Villu Jaanisoo who won a national invitational contest. Made out of rubber tires that were bent and shaped to form the colossal beast, the ape’s pose is more calm than menacing, even with the similarities to King Kong. From top to bottom, the creature is almost 17 feet tall. Students and visitors often climb up into the gorilla’s arms, looking about the size of an infant in comparison. Helsinki University’s Viikki campus is known as the life sciences center for the college, focusing on the school’s biology, agriculture, and veterinary programs. Nicknamed the “Green Campus,” the gorilla-shaped tire pile might seem like a strange fit for the space, but the statue represents not only the diversity of life, but also the a focus on environmentalism and reuse. While these connotations may be foremost in the minds of the students that wander past the work each day, for many Everything is Possible simply represents the strange wonder of a world where a giant gorilla made of tires can exist. Update: On January 10th 2018 the Tire Gorilla was set ablaze and destroyed. Located in Viikinkaari street, behind Viikin tiedepuisto bus stop.",colleges sculptures animals art
156,Catacombes de Paris,"Paris, France","The vast, legendary catacombs hold secrets much stranger than stacked bones.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/catacombes-de-paris,"In 2004, Parisian police were assigned to do a training exercise in a previously uncharted part of the Catacombs of Paris beneath the Palais de Chaillot. Entering the catacombs through a drain, officers first came across a sign that read “Building site, no access,” and a bit further in, a camera that actively recorded images of those who passed. As the officers approached the camera, a recording of dogs barking was triggered. The police descended deeper into the tunnels and discovered a 500-square-meter cavern with a fully equipped cinema. It included a giant cinema screen, projection equipment, chairs and a handful of films, from film noir classics to recent thrillers. Someone had turned this abandoned underground cavern into a secret amphitheater. Aside from this, in the next “room,” police discovered a fully-stocked bar and restaurant, complete with tables and chairs. The discovery left police befuddled, not to mention the professional installation of electricity and three phone lines. Three days later, police returned with experts from the French Board of Electricity to try and figure out where the power was coming from. The cables had been cut and a note lying on the floor read, “Do not try and find us.” Quarry tunnels have existed on the outskirts of Paris since Roman times. The limestone in these quarries built Paris as we know it today, and eventually, helped the city expand to the point where the quarries were directly underneath the busy metropolis. Some 200 miles of labyrinthine tunnels are believed to exist. Despite the vast length of the tunneled, underground world, only a small section of it is open to the public. This tiny portion, known as Denfert-Rochereau Ossuary, or more popularly, “The Catacombs,” has become one of the top tourist attractions in Paris. The popular site houses the skeletal remains of some six to seven million former Parisians. Not all areas of the Catacombs are open to the public. Back in the late 18th century, cemeteries were becoming over-populated. Cemeteries such as Les Innocents were so stuffed with the dead that it led to improper burials, open graves, and unearthed corpses. Neighbors began getting sick with infectious diseases due to the unhealthy conditions of the cemetery. Les Innocents was not the only cemetery that was condemned. Many other graveyards were becoming overpopulated, causing problems for the inhabitants of Paris. With tons of empty quarries, police and priests alike discreetly moved the bones to the renovated section of the tunnel over the period between 1787 and 1814.  As some notable people were buried in those “crowded” cemeteries, it is likely that their bones were transferred to the Catacombs. Some of the prominent Frenchmen whose bones might be placed in the Catacombs are Charles Perrault (famous for Little Red Riding Hood, Puss in Boots, and Cinderella), Jean de La Fontaine (known for Fables), Simon Vouet (painter), Salomon de Brosse (architect who designed Luxemburg Palace in Paris), and François Girardon (sculptor). The Catacombs became a popular attraction for royal families and the people of importance and in 1867, the area was opened to the general public. Due to their old age, the quarries not part of the official Catacombs have been deemed unsafe by Parisian officials. Nevertheless, the size and length of the tunnels make it difficult to keep secret societies, thieves, artists and the curious public from entering the dangerous network. In the 1980s, a movement was dedicated to the exploration of the tunnels. After the discovery of the secret cinema, Patrick Alk, a photographer close to the group responsible said the discovery “was a shame, but not the end of the world.” There are dozens of other meeting places just like the one the police discovered in the mysterious labyrinth. He concluded, saying, “you guys have no idea what’s down there.” Due to vandalism and the theft of several skulls, the catacombs were closed from October 2009 through December of the same year. With the reopening of the site comes additional security and bag checks upon exiting.  The Catacombs no longer sells tickets at the door, they must be purchased online up to one week in advance. Another tip would be to go there in the low season and outside of French School holidays. For safety and preservation reasons, it is forbidden to bring suitcases and luggage to the Catacombs. There are no cloakroom facilities on the spot. It is strongly suggested that you do not attempt to explore the catacombs on your own (it is illegal).",ossuaries memento mori catacombs and crypts subterranean sites
157,Père Lachaise Cemetery,"Paris, France","France's most famous cemetery, with some of its most curious tombs.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pere-lachaise-cemetery,"Originally established by Napoleon, the cemetery languished in obscurity until its directors conducted an elaborate publicity campaign culminating in their claiming the remains of Molière. After this, citizens clamored to be buried with the stars, so to speak, and demand skyrocketed. Today, the cemetery is home to several notable graves. That of Oscar Wilde is worth visiting; traditionally, devoted fans kiss the grave while wearing lipstick. Also notable is Jim Morrison, whose grave is a constant source of strife. Routinely, full bottles of Jim Beam, bouquets of roses, and other mementos mori are left as offerings to the singer. The grave itself and the immediate area was once, long ago, strewn with graffiti, but it was cleaned up by Jim’s parents in 1994. Sadly, fanatics also used to chip pieces off the concrete liner of the grave prompting the cemetery staff to order the placement of a steel fence around the grave and increase the number of guards watching visitors. Additionally, vandals have defaced other graves with arrows pointing towards Morrison’s. Aside from its famous inhabitants, the cemetery is a landmark simply for its design and atmosphere, and one of France’s most interesting sites. Another interesting crypt is the one of Allan Kardec, considered the father of Spiritism — as compared to Spiritualism — in France. His real name was Hypolyte Leon Denizard Rivail. The pseudonym originated from mediumistic communications. Both the names “Allan” and “Kardec” were said to have been his names in previous incarnations. He is best known for his classic, Le Livre des Esprits (The Spirits’ Book), first published in 1856. Within this book is expounded a new theory of human life and destiny. The Spirits’ Book is based on trance communications received. The automatic scripts brought forward a thorough and intriguing doctrine of reincarnation. There’s also the tomb of Robertson, the stage name of Étienne-Gaspard Robert, an innovator in phantasmagoria in the late 18th century in Paris, whose monument is decorated with skulls and bas-reliefs showing a crowd being menaced by his illusions of skeletons and ghouls, as well as a hot air balloon ride as Robertson was also an aficionado of early aviation. Two balloonists, Joseph Croce-Spinelli and Théodore Sivel, are remembered with a monument that shows them resting hand-in-hand beneath a draped shroud. The two perished on a balloon ascent on April 15, 1875, at around 28,000 feet in an attempt to beat the standing record and experiment with the use of oxygen at such heights. Some other tombs of notable people to be seen here are that of Frederic Chopin, Honore de Balzac, Edith Piaf, Miguel Angel Asturias (Guatemalan novelist), Gertrude Stein, Georges Cuvier (famous naturalist), Maria Callas (famous opera singer), Max Ernst (surrealist painter), Marie- Madeleine Fourcade (leader of the WWII French resistance), and Amadeo Modigliani (famous Italian artist).  The Père Lachaise Metro station is not actually the closest to the cemetery entrance; it is about half a kilometer away. For a closer Metro stop, use the Philippe Auguste stop on line 2. The free map at the main office (near the Philippe Auguste metro) isn't the best guide for the cemetery & is actually fairly difficult to read, lacking the detail to navigate the cemetery's many paths. Many different maps are available online and it probably isn't too hard to find one with more detail. Just outside the cemetery, near the Père Lachaise metro station there are usually vendors that sell better maps than the one at the main office -- for a few euros, you can get a more accurate map & have a souvenir of the trip. As the cemetery is built on a slight hill, the preferred Metro stop is Gambetta, which is two blocks away.

It’s also home to two marvels of French Renaissance cartography. The Bibliothèque nationale de France can trace its origin all the way back to 1368 when it was founded by Charles V. Despite being moved multiple times and having portions of the collection dispersed, it remained the largest library in the world until the late 1800’s, when other collections surpassed its numbers. The facilities have been rebuilt and expanded in modern times and renovated throughout, leaving it as still one of the largest libraries in the world with over ten million titles. It houses books on the arts, law, economics, languages and literature, science and technology, humanities, philosophy and more. The library also houses numerous collections from antiquity including over 5,000 Greek manuscripts. The library also has an extensive collection of antique coins, including Greek, Roman, and French. Visitors attend the library for a bit of historical tourism as well as to check out the books. Among most popular attractions on display are Louis XIV’s globes.

159,Petite Ceinture,"Paris, France",Abandoned railway line circling the city of Paris.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/petite-ceinture,"The Petite Ceinture railway circling through the city of Paris served urban travelers from 1862 to 1934 before being abandoned. Predating the Paris Métro, the “little belt” railroad connected the main train stations and provided needed fortification for the city. Construction was started in 1852 under the Empire of Napoléon III and Baron Haussmann, the influential civic planner. The 20th century sprawl of Paris beyond the Petite Ceinture and the success of the Métro eventually made the circular railway obsolete. Certain stretches are now overgrown with over 200 species of flora and fauna, vibrant with colorful flowers in the spring months and greenery against vivid graffiti and street art. Bridges, tunnels, and the original tracks remain mostly untouched, hidden just beyond the streets and neighborhoods of the outer arrondissements. A section in the 16th arrondissement was incorporated into the RER regional network system in 1988, and in 2008 a section between the Porte d’Auteuil and the Gare de la Muette was opened to pedestrians as a nature trail. Several other sections are now open to the public, in the 16th, the 15th, and the 12th arrondissements. Although the remaining parts are closed, their accessibility from nine arrondissements makes it popular with urban explorers. The catacombs of Paris even have their easiest entry point from one of the tunnels on the Petite Ceinture. A good way to see some old train stations is to enter via Villa du Bel Air and exit at the old Gare de Charonne before the tunnel. The majority of the tracks are still owned and managed by the SNCF and are still in working order, notably the sections that link the Gare de Bercy with the Gare de Nord and Gare de l’Est in the east of the city. City officials in cooperation with SNCF have begun a program to open up parts of the Petite Ceinture to the communities it runs through. The project is a long term undertaking but has already seen several parts turned into walkways and parks, while still preserving the biodiversity and heritage of the sites. A few dozen kilometers are reserved for pedestrians at the moment. However, keep in mind that some sections are not safe, thus it’s better to walk with a company.  Points of entry on the edges of the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th arrondissements. Easy access at Villa du Bel Air near Porte de Vincennes. If you plan to walk through any of the tunnels be warned they can be very long, quickly become completely dark, and are full of rats. You will need an extremely powerful flashlight to see where you are going and what you're walking on. It can become very rough underfoot and your phone light simply will not do! Opening times at the official entry points vary according to the sections of the railway trail and the season. The trail usually opens between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and closes between 7.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m.",intriguing environs ecosystems architectural oddities architecture
160,59 Rivoli,"Paris, France",Notorious artist squat renovated into legal studios.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/59-rivoli,"The mid-1800s Haussmann era building at 59 Rivoli was an artist squat for years before being renovated by the city and returned to a collective of artists. After Crédit Lyonnais abandoned the space, a group of artists called “KGB” (standing for Kalex, Gaspard, and Bruno) claimed the building in 1999. Despite the dead pigeons and syringes that littered the deteriorating structure, the group was soon hosting exhibitions and performances under the name “Chez Robert, électrons libres.” Although the space was illegally occupied, by 2001 it was getting 40,000 visitors a year, making it the third most visited center for contemporary art in Paris. In 2006, the city of Paris acquired 59 Rivoli as part of its effort to bring legality and building safety to popular illegal artist squats. After renovations, it reopened in 2009 with studios for over 30 artists who pay minimal rent. The six stories of 59 Rivoli and its exhibits are free and open to the public. While the wild art that once covered the facade is now much more tame, there are still whimsical and expressive installations that turn up on the stone exterior.

161,Shakespeare and Company,"Paris, France","This iconic Parisian bookstore doubles as the ""Tumbleweed Hotel"" for traveling writers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shakespeare-and-company,"In 1951, an eccentric American named George Whitman opened a bookstore with the hope of creating a literary hub in the heart of Paris. Whitman, a fervent communist, decided he would welcome all writers needing a place to stay in Paris as his own personal guests at the bookstore. Painted over an inner door is the bookshop’s motto “be kind to strangers lest they be angels in disguise,” an endearing welcome for all those with a heart astray. The requirements are simple. On a first-come, first-serve basis, these guests—whom Whitman dubbed the “Tumbleweeds”—must write a biography and help out for an hour or two a day around the bookstore. With 13 beds concealed as bookshelves during the day, Shakespeare and Company has become a utopia for the wanderlust-stricken traveler, looking for a place to stay in Paris. Whitman calls the bookstore “a socialist utopia masquerading as a bookstore.” Originally the shop was named Le Mistral, but on the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s birth in 1964, Whitman renamed it Shakespeare and Company. The name is an homage to the bard, as well as to a legendary bookstore of the same name, which was owned by Sylvia Beach and frequented by Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and other writers. The original Shakespeare and Company on the Rue de l’Odeon closed during World War II, but Whitman’s shop picked up the mantle. Today, over 50 years later, Whitman’s daughter, Sylvia—also named in honor of Sylvia Beach—has taken over the day-to-day management of the store, but the Tumbleweed tradition still lives on with as many as 40,000 people having slept in the shop over the years. Regular activities that occur in the bookshop are Sunday tea, poetry readings, and writers’ meetings. In the 1950s, the shop served as a base for many of the writers of the Beat Generation, such as Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and William S. Burroughs. Years later the adjacent building was purchased by Shakespeare & Co., and now functions as a café and bistro featuring literature-themed menu items to budding writers. The library has also been featured in Richard Linklater’s film Before Sunset (2004) and in Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris (2011).  Shakespeare and Company is located on the Left Bank of Paris, opposite the Notre Dame cathedral, on 37 rue de la Bûcherie in the Latin Quarter. The bookstore is open daily from 10 am to 10 pm, while the adjacent cafe is open from 9:30 am to 7 pm (8 pm on weekends). Shakespeare and Company can get crowded (especially on weekends) so it is advised to visit the bookstore either earlier in the day or later in the evening to avoid lines. For those keen on staying at Shakespeare and Company as a tumbleweed, you'll have to get in touch with the bookshop directly via e-mail, with the subject line ""Tumbleweed"" to plan your accommodations in advance.",shakespeare bookstores places to stay literature
162,Montmartre Cemetery,"Paris, France",A horde of stray cats rule in this secluded Parisian cemetery under a bridge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/montmartre-cemetery,"Lying at the foot of Montmartre in the 18th arrondissement of Paris is a secluded cemetery. Whilst not as sought out as its more illustrious contemporaries, Pere Lachaise to the East or Montparnasse to the South, Montmarte is a leafy and idyllic final resting place for many of the artists who lived in the famous neighbourhood. Built below street level, a large part of the cemetery lies underneath the busy Rue Caulaincourt, giving it a secluded air. Once grand mausoleums covered in cobwebs lie nestled below the wrought iron blue bridge. Montmartre cemetery opened for business in 1825, on the site of an abandoned quarry that had been used as a makeshift mass grave in the Revolution. And for many of the renowned artists who worked and lived on Montmartre, it became their final home. Degas, Heinrich Heine, Berlioz, Alexander Dumas, Francois Truffaut, Emile Zola and Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone are all buried in the cemetery. Montmartre is a peaceful and serene haven from the bustling city that overshadows it, but it is also home to it’s own little community: a large group of cats. No one is quite sure where they came from, but dozens and dozens of cats live amongst the mausoleums, quietly sunning themselves on the marble tombstones and keeping watch over their long forgotten inhabitants.",cats graveyards cemeteries animals
163,House of Nicolas Flamel,"Paris, France",The oldest stone house in Paris was built by its most famous alchemist.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-nicolas-flamel,"Strange symbols adorn the architecture at 51 rue de Montmorency in Paris. The house was in fact built by the city’s most famous alchemist, who many believe achieved great wealth through his discovery of the Philosopher’s Stone. Nicolas Flamel was born sometime in the 14th century and worked for most of his life as a bookseller. However, many believe that he happened upon an arcane text that revealed the secrets of turning ordinary metals into gold. It is true that Flamel was a great philanthropist, but whether or not this wealth came from alchemy is the stuff of debatable legends. Nevertheless, Flamel’s name has become inextricable from alchemy, and he’s seen as one of its great practitioners by many interested in the transformation of elements into greater forms. The house on Montmorency Street was built by Flamel in 1407 and is now the oldest stone house in Paris. It’s here where Flamel is said to have carried out his experiments in alchemy. Flamel died in the 15th century, but not before designing his own tombstone with its own symbology that is now on display at the Musée de Cluny. The church he was originally buried in, the Church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, has since been torn down, leaving only the looming Tour Saint-Jacques. A street by the tower has been named for Flamel, which intersects with one named for his wife Pernelle. As for the former home of Flamel, it is now an atmospheric restaurant, appropriately taking the name Auberge Nicolas Flamel.  The building is still the same from the outside, but the interior has been converted into a restaurant, Auberge Nicolas Flamel.",alchemy occult magic restaurants houses homes

These days, however, Rue Crémieux is an increasingly sought out haunt for fashion photographers, filmmakers, and people looking for something uniquely suited the color-saturated world of Instagram. In many respects, this quaint throughway between Rue de Lyon and Rue de Bercy doesn’t really feel like Paris at all and is perhaps more reminiscent of Portobello Road in London’s Notting Hill, or Burano in Venice. Amid the colorful façades, trompes l’œil paintings, and shuttered windows, are window boxes and terracotta pots filled with lush plants that add to the feeling you have somehow escaped Paris for a moment. This is a residential street, albeit a very short one, but the homes are not large. In fact, on one side of the street, the building is little more than one room in depth. An interesting fact that few visitors to Rue Crémieux probably realize is that the street is actually named after a lawyer. Jokes aside, it was renamed in 1897 in dedication to Adolphe Crémieux, who defended the human rights of the Jewish people living in France. Instagram has made Rue Crémieux so famous that residents have felt increasingly under siege from visitors who forget that the street is a residential neighborhood. In early 2019, residents tired with the noise, pointing lenses, and inconsiderate tourists asked the city of Paris to erect gates closing the street to visitors on evenings and weekends. One particularly understanding resident of Rue Cremieux told the BBC that she understands people want to visit the street and take pictures, but she asked visitors to “do it with some common courtesy and respect for property owners, fellow visitors, and the environment.”  Remember, this is a residential street, so be respectful of the occupants' privacy.",color roads art

Although subsequent development has allowed 24 hours access to the island, an in-progress dam will restore the rock to its previous state as entirely surrounded by water during high tide. Regardless of whether there exists a 24 hour bridge to the rock or not, Mont Saint-Michel remains a singularly beautiful structure atop a amazing geological formation. During the day take a tour of the abbey and the (tiny) surrounding town. Even better, stay overnight in one of the hotels and you’ll have the run of the grounds as the island empties to only a handful of residents after dark. The abbey was originally built to the schematics of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, after both an abbot and a count had had visions of St. Michael. Historians suggest, though, that this was merely a scheme to increase tourism into the area. This place also is of interest for those of us, who are into the Arthurian mythology, as Thomas Malory claims that this is the place where King Arthur himself battled a virgin devouring giant, before going off on his campaign against the emperor of Rome.

But rather than some dry symbol of measurement the spot known as Paris Point Zero has attracted a surprising number of local rituals. One of a number of so-called “kilometre zeroes” around the world, Paris Point Zero marks the supposedly exact center of the city or country. All other locations are thought to be measured as a distance radiating from this point. Paris’ center is marked by an octagonal brass plate that is set rather unremarkably into the concrete of the square. due to the marker’s low profile, some visitors have a hard time even finding it, but often times when they do, it has become customary to pay respects in any of a number of ways. Many of the customs performed on the site, are of the wish-granting variety, be it spinning in a circle on one foot atop the marker to gain your heart’s desire or kissing a loved one above the plate to ensure a eternal devotion. Sometimes the slightly concave marker can even be found to be filled with coins thanks to the popular tradition of using the point as a sort of wishing well. Others still pay pilgrimage to the site when they feel that they have experienced Paris to its fullest, using it as a proverbial period in the story of their journey. Undoubtedly there are countless other rituals of devotion to the very heart of Paris, but however it is expressed, this geographic marker likely receives more love than most around the world. Update May 2019: Because of the fire of Notre Dome Cathedral in April 2019, this location is now inaccessible and may be for a while. It would appear that the Paris Point Zero is also the same location the Notre Dame Christmas tree (donated by Sweden) is stationed during the Christmas holiday season, rendering the Zero point obscured entirely.",kilometre zeroes geographic markers rites and rituals

The wood-lined room is one of the original galleries of the Grande Galerie de l’Évolution. It is kept cold and dark, with most light coming from the glass and wood display cases. The specimens, in various states of completion from whole taxidermy examples to single pressed branches, represent animals and plants that have been completely extinguished, and others that are fading from existence. There are disappearing animals like the Aye-aye, a large nocturnal lemur from Madagascar; the critically endangered Sumatran Tiger; and a preserved Coelacanth, the ancient fish long believed to be extinct that resurfaced in South Africa in 1938, later to be found in the Comoros and Indonesia. A Barbary lion and Cape lion, both extinct in the wild, snarl and stare from their shared glass case in the center of the room. Many of the taxidermy animals, skeletons, and other specimens are the only examples of extinct creatures. The gallery contains the sole complete black emu skeleton and only complete mounted Schomburgk’s Deer, chased for its ornate antlers in Thailand. There is the extinct quagga, a zebra with stripes only on its head; a Rodrigues Giant Tortoise; a dried Cry Violet; a pinned Xerces Blue butterfly; a Tasmanian Tiger; one of two known specimens of the Santa Lucian Giant Rice Rat; a mounted Bluebuck skin; one of only seven preserved Hawaii ʻOo, a bird hunted for its striking yellow feathers; one of three Seychelles giant tortoises; and one of ten known specimens of the Martinique Muskrat, a species that met its final end when it chose the Mount Pelée volcano as its last refuge, perishing in the 1902 eruption. Alongside these relics of natural history is a gold clock made for Marie-Antoinette by Robert Robin, Louis XVI’s clockmaker. It was confiscated during the French Revolution and still chimes through the stillness of the gallery.

If so, Un Regard Moderne is the cathedral of international counterculture. Blossoming decades ago in rue Git-le-Coeur (literally “The Street Where your Heart Lay Down”), where Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs used to have their parisian stronghold, this bibliophilia treasure box is filled up to the ceiling with the most subversive, intriguing, and unusual art books, essays and comics that have inspired generations of bookworms and eye hedonists. Named by owner Jacques Noel after the French avant-garde graphics collective Bazooka, this bookstore remains an active crossroad for independent publishers, underground artists and musicians - or anyone that still believes books are magnetic artifacts capable of transforming your mind. The store itself, a two-room shop that can’t hold more than five people at the same time, gives the eerie feeling of being lost in Escher Daedalic structures arranged in a way that are almost anarchic.

172,Jules Lavirotte's 29 Avenue Rapp,"Paris, France",A scandalous Art Nouveau collaboration that set Paris all atwitter at the turn of the century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jules-lavirottes-29-avenue-rapp,"Those who think that Hector Guimard was the only eccentric architect to produce Art Nouveau designs in the Paris will be left speechless by the building at 29 Avenue Rapp. Built in 1901 by Jules Lavirotte, this seven-story creation is probably the most extreme example of the ornamental delirium that is Nouveau that the French capital has hidden away. Lavirotte didn’t do it alone, but collaborated with his friends, the ceramist Alexandre Bigot and other fellow sculptors, to create this flamboyant and voluptuous façade, making them winners of the annual architectural frontage competition of Paris that same year. Due to its asymmetry, organic forms and color tones, and use of modern materials, the building was very much an object of gossip at the turn of the century, unsurprising when you’re confronted with it the first time. 29 Avenue Rapp presents an extraordinary amount of erotic wit, visually translated through stone in both abstract motifs and figurative symbols that were immediately understood by fin de sciecle minds, even in the most prudish of observers. Instead of the colossal caryatids, Lavirotte chose figures that represent a quiet, personal view of Adam and Eve – through his eyes, Eve becomes an arrogant beauty proudly teasing the viewer with her curves, while her guileless lover has some difficulty hiding his virility. The bestiary of sin also appears, including peacocks, reptiles, bulls for masculinity and insects for its alter ego, while the bronze lizard which serves as the entrance handle refers to old slang describing male genitalia. If the message wasn’t clear enough, Lavirotte designed the wooden door as a gigantic reversed phallus, adjusting the already extravagant look of the overall composition. Stuck between two very Puritan examples of Haussmanian architecture, Lavirotte’s 29 Avenue Rapp appears like a steam-punk aphrodisiac factory.

173,Gustave Eiffel's Secret Apartment,"Paris, France",High atop the Eiffel Tower is a small apartment built exclusively to entertain the science elite and make the rest of Paris jealous.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gustave-eiffels-secret-apartment,"When the Eiffel Tower opened in 1889 to much wonder and acclaim, designer Gustave Eiffel soaked up the praise, but as if that wasn’t enough, it was soon revealed that he had built himself a small apartment near the top of the world wonder garnering him the envy of the Paris elite in addition to his new fame. Located on the third level of the tower, Eiffel’s private apartment was not large, but it was cozy. In contrast to the steely industrial girders of the rest of the tower, the apartment was reported to be, “furnished in the simple style dear to scientists.” The walls were covered in warm wallpaper and the furniture included soft chintzes, wooden cabinets, and even a grand piano, creating a comfortable atmosphere, perched nearly 1,000 feet in the air. Adjacent to the small apartment were some laboratory areas equipped with the experimentation gear of the day. Once word got out about Eiffel’s cozy little nest in the sky, Parisian high society turned simultaneously green with jealousy. Eiffel is said to have received a number of sky-high (pun intended) offers to rent out the space, even for one night. He declined them all, preferring to use the space for quiet reflection and to entertain prestigious guests such as Thomas Edison himself who gifted Eiffel one of his newfangled phonograph machines.  Today, after being off limits for years, the apartment can be viewed through a window by visitors who buy a ticket to the top.

The site offers locally produced food and products that encourage customers to take part in environmentally sound practices in their own life. In addition to its culinary roots, the center, which boasts eight separate spaces in the fully repurposed train station they call home, also offers classes that teach DIY and creative skills ranging from theater to gardening to cooking. The site also plays host to such community building events as seed swaps, readings, and concerts. While most visitors and tourists to Paris are crowding bistros and bourgeois restaurants, La REcyclerie gives people an alternative that shows a side of Paris that most people don’t associate with the city. The center is also planning on instituting an urban garden complete with goats and chickens, adding an even more vibrant sense of local sustainability to an already Earth-friendly bastion.",community gardens restaurants
175,Harry's New York Bar,"Paris, France","A favorite Paris bar for U.S. expats, including Gershwin, Hemingway, and James Bond.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/harry-s-new-york-bar,"When Ian Fleming decided upon a favorite bar in Paris for James Bond, there was only one option for the discerning secret agent: the legendary Harry’s New York Bar. As laid out in the 1960 short story A View To A Kill, when in Paris, 007 “invariably stuck to the same addresses… if he wanted a solid drink he had it at Harry’s Bar.” By then, Harry’s was already nearly 50 years old, and an institution for some of the most hard-drinking American expats in the City of Light. Located near the Opera in Paris’ prestigious 2nd arrondissement, Harry’s started as a bistro which was purchased and converted into a bar by American jockey, Tod Sloan, opening on Thanksgiving Day, 1911. Called simply “The New York Bar,” the actual wooden bar itself was imported in from Manhattan, and a Scottish barman named Harry MacElhone was hired to run the joint. In 1923, Harry bought the bar outright, added his name, and began to turn Harry’s into one of Paris’ most legendary watering holes. As American writers, artists and sportsmen began to flock to Paris during the Jazz Age, Harry’s New York Bar became a staple on the hard drinking circuit. Its address, 5 Rue Daunou, was the bar’s calling card, with advertisements in the international press running a tagline telling visitors to simply ask taxi drivers to head to “Sank Roo Doe Noo.” Those who followed the ad’s directions included F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jack Dempsey, Thornton Wilder, and most famously, Ernest Hemingway. It was in the dark mahogany piano bar decorated with faded American College pennants that George Gershwin is said to have composed An American In Paris. Along with journalist O.O. McEntyre, Harry created a society for his illustrious guests, the International Bar Flies, whose aim was the serious business of drinking. Members had their own secret handshake and decorated their narrow silk ties with a tie clip featuring a two friendly looking, well dressed flies. As well as being the adopted home of legendary ex-pat drinkers, Harry’s also claims to be the home of legendary drinks. Fernand Petiot is said to have invented the Bloody Mary there in 1921 (although other accounts place the restorative cocktail’s birthplace at Manhattan’s 21 Club by George Jessel). Harry MacElhone himself invented the French 75, a potent mix of champagne, gin, lemon juice and sugar that Harry likened to being hit by a French 75mm artillery shell. His 1919 book, “Harry’s ABC of Mixing Cocktails” also included the equally strong Side Car and White Lady. Today, Harry’s remains a quaint, welcoming neighborhood bar, still run by the MacElhone family; the current owner is Harry’s grandson’s widow, Isabelle MacElhone. With no televisions and the only music coming from George Gershwin’s piano room downstairs, couples nestle together in what claims to be Europe’s first cocktail bar, virtually unchanged, and still serving up the same well-made drinks that made it a second home to Hemingway and Fitzgerald. And the International Bar Flies are still going strong, just as they were the night James Bond said to his taxi driver “Sank Roo Doe Noo,” beginning a memorable evening in Paris “culminating in the loss, almost simultaneous, of his virginity and his note case.”",bars alcohol books literature music
176,Centre Pompidou,"Paris, France","An ""inside out"" building in the historical center of Paris, featuring Europe’s largest modern art museum.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/centre-pompidou,"Located in Paris’ 4th arrondissement, Centre Georges Pompidou’s exterior and interior are almost equally absurd and surreal. The exterior uses an “inside out” design with large pipes on the building’s facade, and the inside consists of some quite conceptual outside-the-box modern art. In the early stages of planning, the creators of Centre Pompidou decided to leave the blueprint of the building up to an architectural design competition. The winner was a team of three architects (two Italians and a Brit) who drafted the blueprints for a 7-story, 1.1 million-square-foot architectural masterpiece that, according to National Geographic, was “love at second sight” for the founders. The inside-out exterior moved the building’s functional appliances out of the main space and into the open air so that the galleries inside could have more room to work with. To spice things up even more, the building’s appliances were color-coded: blue for heating and cooling, green for plumbing pipes, yellow for electrical wiring, and red for the escalator (which, of course, is located on the exterior of the building too). But the view from the outside isn’t even half of it — it’s what’s on the inside that counts. Past the pipes and the entrance doors of Centre Pompidou lies the successful manifestation of an idea to create a modern, non-traditional multicultural complex of art and literature in the center of one of the world’s biggest cities. This was fulfilled by placing the Musée National D’Art Moderne (National Museum of Modern Art) in the center of the building, making it the largest modern art museum in the entire continent of Europe. But art isn’t just visual; it’s also audio-based — hence, Centre Pompidou is also the home of IRCAM, a music research center. And as if that wasn’t enough, the building also manages to fit in a 6th floor restaurant offering a panoramic view of Paris, as well as incorporating literature via the Bibliothèque Publique D’Information (Public Information Library). Some smaller yet equally bizarre attractions in Centre Pompidou include the Stravinsky Fountain, a fountain with 16 sculptures representing characters from songs composed by Igor Stravinsky, and “Horizontal,” a mobile created by the inventor of the mobile, Alexander Calder. In front of the building, a plaza called “Place Georges Pompidou” is well known for its mimes, jugglers, artists, and street performers. Although many preservationists objected to building something designed like an oil refinery in the historical center of Paris, the general public has responded positively, as the combination of art and oddity is something we could all certainly use more of.",modernism libraries music architectural oddities art museums architecture
177,Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy,"Paris, France",This museum houses an imposing skeleton army comprised of creatures great and small.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gallery-of-paleontology-and-comparative-anatomy,"For over a century the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy has been fascinating and terrifying visitors with its massive cram of reconstructed animal skeletons. Established in 1898 in an effort to preserve a number of then-scattered scientific collections, the multi-floor galleries of fossils and bones present one of the most wide-ranging and comprehensive presentations of natural artifacts in the world. The museum is divided into two separate galleries, each with a staggering collection. The Gallery of Paleontology is filled with amazingly complete fossils and most impressively, a number of massive dinosaur skeletons arrayed amongst the buildings ornate glass and iron architecture. Here too are the remains of weird and wonderful extinct, prehistoric beasts such as the Giant ground sloth, woolly rhinoceros, and many species of mammoth ranging from some the size of cows to others larger than today’s elephants. However, the real showpiece of the museum is the Gallery of Comparative Anatomy. In this section of the museum, over 1,000 animal skeletons are packed literally wall to wall in the massive gallery. The remains of each beast are faced in the same direction creating the illusion of an undead stampede as visitors enter the space. Horses, elephants, large cats and any number of other creatures are represented in the giant bone collection. The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy is actually part of France’s sprawling National Museum of Natural History which incorporates around 14 institutions around the country.

Founded by anti-clerical French revolutionaries to celebrate the glory of science, it is no small irony that the museum is now partially housed in the former abbey church of Saint Martin des Champs. The museum’s collection originated with a selection of mechanical contraptions bequeathed to Louis XVI by the mechanical engineer Jacques Vaucanson, inventor of the most renowned automaton of the 18th century, a talking, flapping, defecating mechanical duck. (The duck is no longer in existence, though a modern replica exists in the Museum of Automatons in Grenoble, France.) The Arts et Métiers collection soon grew to include machines of industry like the Jacquard loom, chronometers, the first steam-powered automobile, the chemist Antoine Lavoisier’s laboratory, calculating machines, and other marvels of the Enlightenment. The recently renovated museum is broken up into several sets of exhibits: scientific instruments, materials and their fabrication, construction, communications, and energy. One darkened room hosts a theater of automata, including one that once belonged to Marie-Antoinette. There is even the original model of the Statue Liberty on which the sculptor Frederic Bartholdi based its much grander New York counterpart. The museum’s final exhibit is housed in the grandiose Saint Martin des Champs, and features early automobiles and aircraft, including Marcel Leyat’s “Hélica” airplane car, as well as one of Foucault’s pendulums, which the scientist used to definitively prove the rotation of the earth. Another in the museum’s possession once hung from the dome of the Pantheon. Several times a day, museum staff members gather groups of curious visitors around the pendulum to explain exactly how it works, and how Foucault used it to prove what he did.

A small part of the street was spared by successive urban transformation plans, and as a result it has kept its odd medieval character. This is because, until the 18th century, this area was the very protected domain of Chanoine monks who, isolated from the world, devoted themselves to their work and meditations. But the monastic past of the street is not the only mystery to be found here. Behind the red door of the building marked number 26, you’ll find one of the most unusual and macabre pieces of architecture to be found in the French capital. A small courtyard rests silently behind the intriguing scarlet door, and the stone-laid ground of the courtyard bears some Gothic-styled texts visible near the wall. After a bit of examination, you’ll realize their purpose — these are gravestones, which once belonged to churches that closed around the 19th century. Much later, the gravestones were used by the architects of this lovely courtyard to tile the floor. And there they remain to this day, ready to be discovered and explored.

181,"Statue of Liberty, Pont de Grenelle","Paris, France",This statue was given to France by the United States to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/statue-of-liberty-pont-de-grenelle,"There are many magnificent sites one can expect to see from the top of the Eiffel Tower: the Arc de Triomphe; Notre-Dame Cathedral; the Louvre. Something one might not expect to see is a replica of the Statue of Liberty. And yet, just to the south, smack dab in the middle of the river Seine, by golly there it is. The quarter-scale replica sits on the southern end of Île aux Cygnes, an artificial island built in the Seine in 1827 to separate river traffic from the busy port of Grenelle. Over time, a tree-lined walkway was built that runs the full 850-meter length of the island, and three bridges were built across the island to connect the 15th and 16th arrondissements. Île aux Cygnes is the third-largest island in Paris. The statue itself was given to the city of Paris in 1889 by the American community in Paris to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution. In characteristic American fashion, the statue was officially inaugurated on the Fourth of July (a date not at all associated with the French Revolution) rather than Bastille Day (a mere ten days later, and often described to the uninitiated as the “French Fourth of July”). To be fair, the inauguration was presided over by French President Marie Fran­çois Sadi Carnot, who probably had other things to do on Bastille Day (also, the statue’s tablet bears the date July 14, 1789, as well as July 4, 1776). The gift was given to highlight the historically close bond between France and the United States, and reaffirm the dedication of the two nations to the republican ideal on which they were founded. This Pont de Grenelle Statue of Liberty was installed some three years after the New York Statue of Liberty, and in fact was originally one of the working models made whilst preparing to construct the “real thing.” The statue can be accessed via either the Pont de Grenelle or the Pont de Bir-Hakeim, both of which cross the Île aux Cygnes. While this is not the only Statue of Liberty replica in Paris—both the Musée d’Orsay and the Musée des Arts et Métiers house their own—this is the only Statue of Liberty replica in Paris that was featured in National Treasure: Book of Secrets.

182,Foucault's Pendulum,"Paris, France",19th century pendulum and a clock restored by a rogue group of guerilla artists.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pantheon-paris,"In 1851, physicist Léon Foucault demonstrated the rotation of the Earth with an experiment conducted in the Paris Panthéon. By constructing a fixed 67-meter swinging lead bob beneath the central dome, Foucault was able to prove that the earth was in fact in rotation at all times, as the plane of the pendulum never changed, yet it seemed to move with earth’s rotation. While the original pendulum is now housed at the Musée des Arts et Métiers, a working copy is displayed at the Panthéon and has been swinging there since 1995. Despite the history of the Panthéon, where notable French figures from Victor Hugo to Voltaire are interred in what was repurposed as a church of reason during the French Revolution, modern day achievements in the building are perhaps even more fascinating. In 2007, four members of the rogue art group Untergunther snuck into the Panthéon and restored the famous clock inside the building. Without being caught, the group decided to reveal itself and took credit for the work in front of the building administrator. Shortly after, the police were alerted, resulting in the arrest of the four members and a ridiculous trial in which the members of Untergunther were declared innocent.

You can still spot his signature on the bottom right corner of the sundial. The shell face is meant to reference the scallop symbol of the pilgrimage of St. Jacques de Compostella (also known as the Way of St. James), for whom the street is named.

Not at “Dans le Noir?” it isn’t. Dinner in complete darkness is what Dans le Noir? offers. Judging from the majority of reviews, whether this is a good thing or not is unclear. Co-funded by the Paul Guinot Foundation for Blind People, the restaurant is staffed entirely by the visually impaired. Visitors are seated by a waiter-guide and given hints on how to avoid spilling, such as “putting a finger inside your wineglass” - but beyond this, diners are on their own. Diners call their server by literally calling out for them. In the words of one diner, “You have no idea where your fellow diners are sitting, how many are at the table, how big the room is, or indeed if the guy in the next seat has stripped naked and is rubbing asparagus spears into his groin. It’s genuinely disconcerting.” There is a surprise menu to give the diners the additional excitement of trying to guess what exactly they are eating. Apparently this is where the Dans le Noir? experience leaves something to be desired. Whether this is due to the diner’s inability to see the food or the chef’s inability to make something that tastes good, even in the dark, is up for debate. There are Dans le Noir? restaurants in London and in Moscow, and another company called “Blackout” has just opened an all-blind-waitstaff restaurant in Tel-Aviv, next door to the “Kappish” cafe, whose waitstaff is all-deaf: On the table at Kappish is a sheet with instructions on how to order in sign language.",Unique Restaurants & Bars shops

The Louxor struggled for decades to find an audience and eventually specialized in “exotic” cinema, showing Bollywood, North African films, and erotic features late at night. In the 1980s, it became an Antillean nightclub, and then the Parisian equivalent of the Studio 54, where the gay and party community used it as a stronghold.

In reality it is a cave-palace-monastery built not by dwarfs, but by Georgians in the Caucasus for their fabled queen Tamar. In desperate circumstances people are often driven to perform feats of mythical proportions. In the late 1100s the medieval kingdom of Georgia was resisting the onslaught of the Mongol hordes, the most devastating force Europe had ever seen. Queen Tamar ordered the construction of this underground sanctuary in 1185, and the digging began, carving into the side of the Erusheli mountain, located in the south of the country near the town of Aspindza. When completed this underground fortress extended 13 levels and contained 6000 apartments, a throne room and a large church with an external bell tower. It is assumed that the only access to this stronghold was via a hidden tunnel whose entrance was near the banks of Mtkvari river. The outside slope of the mountain was covered with fertile terraces, suitable for cultivation, for which an intricate system of irrigation was designed. With such defenses, natural and man made, the place must have been all but impregnable to human forces. Alas, the glorious days of Vardzia didn’t last for very long. Though safe from the Mongols, mother nature was a different story altogether. In 1283, only a century after its construction, a devastating earthquake literally ripped the place apart. The quake shattered the mountain slope and destroyed more than two-thirds of the city, exposing the hidden innards of the remainder. However despite this, a monastery community persisted until 1551 when it was raided and destroyed by Persian Sash Tahmasp. Today the place is maintained by a small group of zealous monks. About three hundred apartments and halls remain visitable and in some tunnels the old irrigation pipes still bring drinkable water.

The place was founded in the late Bronze Age, around 1000 BC, and continued to be inhabited until 13th century AD. Between the 6th century BC and the 11st century AD, Uplistsikhe was one of the most important political and religious centers of pre-Christian Kartli – one of the predecessors of the Georgian state. Archaeologists have unearthed numerous temples and findings relating to a sun goddess, worshipped prior to the arrival of Christianity. When Christianity arrived in Georgia, the city lost importance in favor of the new centers of Christian culture, most notably Mtskheta and Tbilisi. Nevertheless, life continued in Uplistsikhe, Christian structures have been built, and for a short time, Christianity and the old faith coexisted in the city. After the Arab conquest of the royal city of Tbilisi, the town’s second heyday began, when Uplistsikhe became the residence of the kings of Kartli, during which the town grew to a size of around 20,000 people, evolving into an important caravan trading post. When Tbilisi was recaptured in 1122, Uplistsikhe faced an immediate and rapid decline, culminated by the destruction of large parts of the city during the Mongol conquest in the 13th century, and the subsequent abandonment of the rest of the town. The cave town can be divided into a lower, a central and an upper area, covering an area of almost 40,000 square meters. The central area, which contains most of the rock-cut structures, is connected to the lower area by narrow tunnel. Most of the rock-cut structures are without any decorative elements, aside from some of the larger structures, which contain some stone carvings. At the top of the complex is a Christian stone basilica, dating from the 10th century. The rock-cut structures include a large hall, called Tamaris Darbazi, pagan places of sacrifice, dwellings, as well as functional buildings, like a pharmacy, a bakery, a prison, and even an amphitheater. The rock-cut structures are connected by tunnels, while other tunnels had the purpose of an emergency escape route. Uplistsikhe is remarkable for the unique combination of styles from rock-cut cultures of the region, most notably from Cappadocia (in modern Turkey) and Northern Iran. Most of the unearthed artifacts can be seen at the National Museum in Tbilisi.

190,Leaning Tower of Tbilisi,"Tbilisi, Georgia",The charmingly disheveled clock tower of Tbilisi's puppet theater.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leaning-tower-tbilisi,"The leaning tower of Tbilisi is one of the city’s most unusual buildings. Tucked into a side street of old town, it truly is a bizarre structure, with a tower on the perpetual brink of falling down, and only a steel beam holding the tower in place. A huge clock sits in the middle of the disheveled tower, with a leaning column on its side. While an incredibly odd sight, it’s not an old structure. It is a modern tower, attached to the puppet theatre of renowned puppeteer Rezo Gabriadze. He himself is the brainchild behind the structure, as well as the building to its side, which houses the actual theatre. Gabriadze built the theatre himself over a timespan of thirty years, reusing old pieces from abandoned structures of the old town, and from buildings destroyed following a major earthquake. The weird clock tower was added in 2011, after a four-year construction phase. It’s hard not to fall in love with the playful, naive architecture of the tower. This is especially true when on the hour, a window opens at the small balcony at the top, and a mannequin of an angel strikes the bell. Below the clock, a screen opens and shows the circle of life: boy meets girl, marriage, childbirth and funeral. Aside from being a magnificent and truly unique structure, the tower is also an impressive statement against soulless urban modernization, and the semi-identical glass-and-steel structures that continue to pop up in nearly every city on the planet – including Tbilisi. While modern structures continue to appear in Tbilisi, large parts of the old town are in a shocking state of disrepair, and while a lot of reconstruction work has been carried out, the city’s government seems to be more eager to set modern landmarks than preserve the old ones.",amazing automata wondrous performances retro-tech outsider architecture architectural oddities architecture
191,Katskhi Pillar,"Katskhi, Georgia",Small church on top of a huge rock column.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/katskhi-pillar,"The Katskhi Pillar abruptly rises 40 meters from the hills of Central Georgia and looks similar to a giant’s club. Its mythical aura made it a place of worship since humans settled this area. Prior to the arrival of Christianity, the pillar served as a pagan holy place for a long time and was most likely used for fertility rites. In the 4th century, Georgia adapted Christianity as its state religion, as the second country in the world after Armenia. Slowly, and following a general world trend, Christianity replaced pagan places of worship with Christian ones to consolidate the new beliefs. Thus, the Katskhi Pillar became the site of a small church first built in the seventh century. The church that sits atop the pillar resembles the practice of the Stylites who were early Christian ascetics who prayed on top of wooden pillars. Following the lead of the much-revered Saint Simeon Stylites, who sat atop a pillar for almost 40 years, these pious Christians tortured their bodies and devoted their spirits to their religion. The Katskhi Pillar also bears a striking resemblance to the famous Greek monasteries of Meteora. The Georgian Orthodox Church is currently building a new small church at the top of the rock column, which can be reached via a combination of scaffolding at the lower half and a vertigo-inducing iron ladder at the upper half of the pillar. The earthly remains of a believer, who died atop the pillar at an unknown date, are kept at the contemporary church building. Women are not allowed to climb to the top.

192,Gergeti Trinity Church,Georgia,Take respite inside this jaw-dropping church while climbing the volcano where Georgia's Prometheus was once chained.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gergeti-trinity-church,"Looming large among Georgia’s folk culture is Mount Kazbek, one of the highest peaks in the Caucuses, thanks to its intertwining threat to human life with the anguish inflicted on a beloved—albeit capricious—version of Prometheus. According to Georgian folklore, a hero by the name of Amirani stole fire from the hands of the gods as a gift to his fellow mortals. In punishment, the Prometheus-esque figure was chained high atop Mount Kazbek’s perilous slopes. Scholars estimate the nearest spot to his imprisonment is likely that of the current Orthodox hermitage, located inside the Bethlehem (locally: “Betlemi”) Cave at more than 13,000 feet up the mountain. Despite a titanic mythos, Kazbek’s draw remains more tantalizing to mountaineers than literary and history buffs. The dormant stratovolcano is a mountaineer’s delight with a prominence of 7,720 feet that is relatively easy to access, making Georgia’s third-highest mountain the perfect pairing of accessible and challenging among the legendarily rugged Caucasus range. Along the way, many trekkers are given respite within the walls of a 14th-century Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic church. Located a less-than-two-hour hike straight up the mountainside from the nearest town, the holy refuge known as Gergeti Trinity consists of little more than a cross-cupola church and a separate bell tower. Though briefly abandoned during the Soviet years, the enclave seems frozen in time. In the face of such astounding beauty, Gergeti Trinity’s modest exterior suddenly becomes all the more breathtaking for its simplicity, made all the more so for the benevolence of its residents taking in those sometimes strident folk who seem hellbent on following in the footsteps of castigated heroes they’ve long since cast aside.",mythology volcanoes mountains caves ecosystems churches geology sacred spaces
193,Davit Gareja Cave Monastery,"Udabno, Georgia",Rock-hewn monastery complex with hundreds of cave structures tucked away into the mountainside.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/davit-gareja-cave-monastery,"Davit Gareja is a rock-hewn Orthodox monastery in the Kakheti region of Georgia. It is not far from the  border with Azerbaijan. The climate is often described as a semidesert. Hundreds of cells, churches, refectories, and living quarters have been hewn into the rock face at the steep slopes of Mount Gareja. Saint David, an Assyrian Monk, founded the monastic complex in the 6th century and it was steadily expanded during the following centuries. The monastery complex has been an important center of religious and cultural activity for hundreds of years and this reached its height between the 11th and 13th centuries. The monastery complex was always closely linked with the royalty of Georgia, but the downfall of the Georgian monarchy did not put an end to the monastic activities at Davit Gareja. Neither did the attacks by the Mongols in the 13th century, or the attacks of the Persians in the 17th century. It wasn’t until the Bolshevik takeover in 1921 that the monastery was closed down and became deserted. During the late Soviet years, the monastery became a training ground for the Soviet War in Afghanistan and this caused considerable damage to the murals within the complex and caused a public outcry among Georgians. When Georgia restored its independence, the monastery was revived and it is once again a center of religious activity as well as an important destination for pilgrims and tourists alike. The inside of the cave structures has been covered with numerous murals and fresco paintings, a number of which have survived the test of time. Since the Soviet border-drawing process did not have any regard for cultural borders, especially when religious heritage was involved, today parts of the monastery complex are technically located within Azerbaijan and this has sparked a minor border dispute between the two countries. Given the religious and cultural importance of Davit Gareja, Georgians have stated it to be unacceptable that the site would be split between two countries, and have offered a land swap, but a final agreement has yet to be achieved. As of January 2021: The upper Udabno Monastery remains closed due to the ongoing border dispute. Visitors can still explore Lavra Monastery, the lower part of the complex, but the hiking trail and ridge, frescoes, and upper church are off-limits.  After a hike up the mountain next to the monastery, you can see views of the Azerbaijani border. When climbing down the other side of the mountain, you come across the caves built into the side of the mountain. These caves contain traces of fresco paintings, some of which are fully intact. Some may argue that this is more interesting than the monastery itself. Since the area is not frequented by tourists, you can also see some interesting wildlife. Snakes (some venomous) are present in the summer months so take care. The nearest village is Udabno. You can take a marshutka there and hitchhike to the monastery, or more conveniently, use the Gareji Line transfer service, which leaves from Freedom Square in Tbilisi at 11 AM daily during the high season. For more information, see their Facebook page. The road to Davit Gareja is part asphalt and part rubble. A vehicle with high clearance is recommended but a 4WD is not required. The hike up the mountain is quite steep in parts. Wear proper footwear, and bring water and your own food. There is a new Visitors Center at the site with clean toilets (50 tetri), vending machines, and a shop selling products made by the resident monks.",subterranean sites caves ecosystems sacred spaces ruins

But it has fine examples of modern architectural splendor, as well, including a McDonald’s so fanciful that that it might be the only fast food building to have won awards for architectural brilliance. Designed by architect Giorgi Khmaladze, the futuristic glass structure juts out into the sky, like a spaceship ready for take-off. Its bold edges are softened by a reflective pool streaming along its perimeter. The polyhedronal structure, encased in a cantilevered glass shell, was awarded the Best Commercial Building of 2014 by the architecture website ArchDaily. The familiar golden arches of the McDonald’s logo look diminutive against the backdrop of this towering edifice. Apart from the spectacular architecture there’s more to this McDonald’s that first meets the eye. It’s also built right on top of a gas station. But guests dining inside won’t notice anything of the gas pumps right next to them. A sloping garden offers green respite in the dining area, while also serving as the canopy over the gas station. With the space’s pool and lush vegetation, it’s hard to believe you’re in the midst of a busy city, while the experience of chomping down a Big Mac in this McDonald’s makes fast food feel like fine dining.

The story, first told in the 1937 Austrian novel, Ali and Nino, is a familiar tale of lovers who end up in tragic circumstances that keep them apart. As opposed to warring families, in Ali and Nino’s case, it was the first World War. Ali, an Azerbaijani Muslim, falls in love with Georgian princess, Nino, but sadly, after they are finally able to get together, the war hits home and Ali is killed. The author of the novel is unknown, credited to the alias Kurban Said. But despite the unknown origins, the title has become a literary classic in the area and is considered to be the national novel of Azerbaijan. It was this famous love that inspired Georgian artist Tamara Kvesitadze to create her monumental moving sculpture in 2010. The giant metal artwork, also known as the “Statue of Love,” consists of two somewhat transparent figures made of stacked segments. Each day at 7 PM, the two figures slide towards each other, eventually merging as their segments pass between each other, never truly connecting. Sad stuff. The whole automated performance takes about ten minutes and is often lit with bright, changing colors that give the figures even more life than their stark metal bodies usually project.",robots literature statues
196,Batumi Tower Ferris Wheel,"Batumi, Georgia",The first skyscraper to include a Ferris wheel built into the facade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/batumi-tower-ferris-wheel,"When the Technological University Tower in Batumi, Georgia was completed in 2012, it was the first building ever to include a Ferris wheel built into the facade. Hanging 330 feet (100 meters) above the ground are eight airconditioned cabins with room for a total of 40 people. It would offer a great view over Batumi, if only it was operational. The ferris wheel—as well as the 280-foot (85-meter) mast with a sail on top of the tower—proved to be a challenge for the architects and engineers designing the building, and required wind tunnel tests. Further complicating the construction, the tower was built in a moderate seismic zone. During an earthquake the soil underneath the tower liquefies, and so strategies to prevent this were also developed. What’s more, the plans to open a technological university in the city fell short, and the building stood empty for two years before it was sold in 2015. The plan was to transform the tower into a hotel since many had criticized the building for not being suitable as an education facility. Still, rebuilding it would require massive investments. Still today the tower stands empty in downtown Batumi. Whether it ends up a hotel or university or something else, it will certainly have something special to offer its visitors in the future.  The Batumi Technological University Tower is located in downtown Batumi and is clearly visible in the Batumi skyline.",amusement parks engineering towers architectural oddities architecture
197,The Cable Cars of Chiatura,"Chiatura, Georgia",These Stalin-era industrial 'death traps' hang lifeless above the city,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-cable-cars-of-chiatura-chiatura-georgia,"The city of Chiatura, Georgia was founded among otherwise uninvitingly steep valleys and deep gorges thanks to a healthy vein of manganese that was ripe for the mining. However, the treacherous terrain was too difficult and inefficient for miners to traverse on foot, so the Soviet government installed a precarious network of dangling cable cars. Amazingly, some of the original cable cars – rusted and deteriorating – were still running up until a few years ago. Now they have been retired, their stations shuttered and wagons hanging lifeless on the lines. Founded in the late 1800s as a mining colony, Chiatura quickly became a popular source for manganese and iron that was being taken from the rich mountains in the area. Unfortunately, having workers travel from their communities at the bottom of the hilly gorges and canyons up to the various mining sites each day was incredibly time consuming. So in an effort to get those bodies into those mine tunnels faster, a criss-crossing system of cable cars was installed in 1954 by the Stalinist government. The productivity and output in the mines dramatically increased with the high-flying “metal coffins,” which were also able to carry the ore itself directly to waiting factories. After the collapse of the USSR, many of the mines closed down and yet the ubiquitous cable cars remained in use. Alas, upkeep of the lines and stations wasn’t quite adequate and the old ropeways were finally retired in 2018. Some of the 17-plus old stations will now be restored as cultural heritage monuments. Meanwhile, as of September 2021, a new set of modern ropeways built by French company Poma ferries commuters and visitors around Chiatura. There are four new lines: Mukhadze, Lezhubani, Sanatorium and Naguti.  The old Chiatura cable cars are now retired and will be restored. A few of the stations are closed off with barricades, while the old wagons hang motionless on their lines. Four new cable cars are fully operational and depart from Central Cable Car Station in the centre of the city. The lines are open from 8am-8pm with a break from 2pm-3pm.

It’s a vibrant spot to hunt around for a unique souvenir from your travels. Dry Bridge gets its name from its location: it’s literally a dry bridge. Years ago, an arm of the Kura River created a small island between the east and west banks. That waterway has since dried up, but the name stuck, and the spot now holds one of the most interesting bazaars in Tbilisi. Flea markets such as this sprung up after the fall of the Soviet Union, when locals needed to find ways to make ends meet. Many of the first vendors here at Dry Bridge sold their own goods. It’s a legacy that remains today, though it has a new target audience in tourists. The Dry Bridge market has a bit of a split personality. There are the vendors selling Soviet memorabilia and household items, and then there are the vendors selling crafts, souvenirs, and artwork. Haggling is expected, but it’s unlikely tourists will get as good a deal as a local—the market is cash only and very little English is spoken, but the vendors are friendly and welcoming.

The development of the sanatorium town started in the mid-1920s and by the 1980s was flourishing under the Soviet-mandated “right to rest.” The Tskaltubo health complex consisted of 19 impressive sanatoriums and 9 bathhouses encircling and a large park. At its height, four trains from Moscow arrived in town every day carrying visitors on state-sponsored health retreats. The resort was frequented by many prominent historical figures, and there was even was a bathhouse built especially for Joseph Stalin. Then in 1990, the Soviet Union collapsed, and soon afterward the sanatorium town was abandoned. The once-grand concrete structures were left empty to crumble and decay. However they did not remain empty for long. When war broke out in the nearby Abkhazia region in 1992, an estimated 200,000 ethnic Georgians fled from the conflict, and some 8,000 refugees were given temporary shelter in Tskaltubo’s vacant sanatoriums. Twenty-five years later, hundreds of families are still living in these grand neoclassical relics of the past. Update as of November 2019: Sanatorium Iveria was recently sold. It’s currently undergoing renovations and is surrounded by fencing.  Today, Tskaltubo is still a functioning spa resort town. Several renovated hotels now offer traditional sanatorium services, but the evidence of the town's much grander past is lurking behind overgrown foliage all around.",refugees bath house soviet architecture resorts spring health soviet history abandoned ruins
200,Tbilisi Sulfur Baths,"Tbilisi, Georgia",A cluster of historic bathhouses built on the famed hot springs that gave the Georgian capital its name.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sulfur-baths,"Visiting Tbilisi’s mineral sulfur baths is one of the most pleasant and memorable experiences you can have in Georgia’s capital city. The name “Tbilisi” comes from the word for “warm place,” and the widely taught myth of the city’s founding involves these natural hot springs. The legend states that in medieval times, King Vakhtang went hunting with his falcon (or hawk in some versions of the story) in a heavily wooded region in central Georgia. The falcon caught a pheasant and during the struggle, both birds fell into the hot spring and died from their injuries. The king was so impressed with the hot water that he decided to clear the forest and build a city around this natural wonder. In the Abanotubani neighborhood in Old Tbilisi, a dozen different sulfur bathhouses are clustered together. They are all below ground level and some have semi-circular domed ceilings that allow natural light to stream through. The ceilings also function like little chimneys, for sulfur steam and fresh air circulation in the baths. The sulfuric water is not only gloriously warm (38-40 degrees Celsius on average), it is also supposedly therapeutic. Aside from simply being a relaxing experience, they are also thought to help with various skin ailments like acne and eczema, as well as digestion, insomnia, and arthritis. Visitors can choose between the public baths (communal sex-segregated pools where everyone bathes together) or private rooms. Both are charged by the hour. Prices range from 5 GEL for entry to the public baths right up to 200 GEL for a luxe room with a private sauna. When you check in, the front desk will ask if you want a massage or kisi (kisa) for an additional 10-20 GEL per person. If you say yes, 15 minutes after your bath starts a Mekise will enter your room with a special coarse glove for exfoliating and massaging your body. It’s not a full-on banya experience with the suffocating steam, beating branches and total nudity, but it is not exactly relaxing either. After a rather vigorous full-body scrub, the Mekise will rinse the soap off your body with hot sulfur water. The entire experience lasts about 15 minutes and returning to the sulfur bath afterward feels amazing.  The map coordinates point to Royal Bath House, one of the most popular baths in Abanotubani. Private rooms cost 140 GEL. In the room, you'll find a changing area, private sauna and plunge pool, and private sulfur bath. Bring with you: swimsuit, flip flops, towel, waterproof bag to hold your suit after use, a bottle of fresh water, shampoo/conditioner/soap, hairdryer, and any other toiletries you need to freshen up after your soak. There are plenty of restaurant options within walking distance for lunch or dinner after your trip to the baths.",bath house hot springs health names water history

It was opened in 1975 as the Ministry of Highway Construction of the Georgian SSR. After the independence of Georgia, the building was temporarily unused before being acquired by the Bank of Georgia in 2007, which carried out extensive renovation work of the exterior and interior of the building. The building, by architect George Chakhava, is notable for its unusual design, which resembles piled bricks. Parts of the building are lifted off the ground, so that nature can grow beneath – an architectural concept which was known as Space City Method, centered around the idea to allow foliage to grow in all spaces around and below a building. The structure consists of a grid of interlocking parts, with three parts oriented at an east-west axis, and two on a north-south axis. The unusual design of the structure resembles architectural ideas of the Russian constructivists from the 1920s, but also incorporates elements of the Brutalism movement, most notably the use of concrete and the geometrical outline of the building. A building quite similar in appearance is the Habitat 67 housing complex in Montreal, Canada. Among all Soviet-era buildings in Georgia, the Bank of Georgia Building stands out as the most remarkable one, although today opinions are divided regarding the aesthetics of the building.

Its owner, Sabir Abasov, resurrected the neighborhood hangout after the area was devastated by political unrest. In a district that once housed five teahouses and various independently-owned shops, Sabir’s Chaikhana is an example of how resisting gentrification and large-scale renovation can pay off. Today, Abanotubani is filled with souvenir stores, restaurants, and cafes, which are known for attracting the younger Georgian crowd and tourists. But this teahouse holds history and longtime local patrons close. Sabir’s Chaikhana has no sign, and as such has virtually been a “nameless” teahouse for over a decade. A stone’s throw from the much beloved Jumah Mosque, renowned for being a place of joint worship for Shia and Sunni Muslims, this tea version of a neighborhood pub is a popular hangout spot for people, men especially, who have lived in the district for years. It’s a place for those who remember when Tbilisi was filled with these types of community spaces. Historically, Tbilisi’s proximity to the Silk Road meant that teas passed through this district from both the East and the West, making for an eclectic mix of flavors. Today, the teahouse exclusively serves a loose leaf Ceylon tea, along with sugar, lemon, and nothing else.  The teahouse is open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. You can reach the neighborhood via the Abanotubani transit station, which is a two-minute walk away from the teahouse.

Prometheus the Titan, who, along with Epimetheus, was given the task of creating man, managed to annoy the god Zeus by stealing fire from the gods for man and for refusing to tell Zeus which of his children would dethrone him. As a result of this, Zeus ordered his servants to seize Prometheus, take him to the Caucasus Mountains and chain him to a rock with unbreakable bonds, where he would be subjected to a giant bird pecking at his liver. Legend has it that the rock Prometheus was chained to lies in this cave outside Kutaisi (although it is certainly not the only cave which claims the legend for its own). Discovered in 1984, the cave boasts a wonderful array of stalactites, stalagmites, petrified waterfalls, cave pearls, underground rivers, and lakes. There is also the option of a boat tour on one of the underground rivers. The cave offers a rather pleasant walk, and is spectacularly neon-lit, although the Mozart playing in certain parts might seem to be going a bit far in terms of attempting to create ambience. And if you go in winter, beware – bears and foxes have been known to hibernate in the caves during the colder months.",neon mythology caves ecosystems
204,Towers of Svaneti,"Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Georgia",Fortified homes of highland warriors that are still in use today.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/towers-svaneti,"Life was never easy in the high Caucasus. Nomads from northern steppes eager to get their hands on the riches of Mesopotamia, and Empires battling for supremacy—Assyrians, Macedonians, Persians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Turks, and Mongols—all clashed with fearless locals. The list of invading armies is nearly endless. Svans, a subgroup of Georgians, who speak their own unwritten Svan language, practice blood revenge, and sing complicated polyphonic vocal songs, were the traditional gatekeepers of mountain passes, and since the time immemorial have been hardy survivors, the archetypal highland warriors. Every household in Svaneti is a true fortress. Villages in these rugged landscapes are often too scattered to be encircled with a protective wall. Each individual house thus had to be separately fortified. The tower homes of Svaneti were at the same time familial living quarters, fortified fortresses of defense, and personal treasures. They offered protection to their owners and to their livestock, and also served as shelters for the most valuable possessions of every family, as well as copies of holy scriptures and religious icons and relics. Most of the towers date back to the period between the ninth and 12th centuries. The turbulent history of the region ensured that these fortifications remained in use long after similar defenses become redundant elsewhere in Europe. In recent times families have slowly begun moving out into more comfortable living spaces. However, many of Svan towers still remain in use, and the village of Chazhashi boasts as many as 200. The similar dwellings can be found in a much wider area all over the Caucasus. However, the typical Svaneti towers are concentrated in Mestia district, 128 kilometers northeast of the regional capital of Zugdidi. Anyone wishing to see the towers should head to the remote village of Ushgulan i. With elevation of 2, 086 meters Ushguli is one of the highest inhabited places in Europe. According to local lore, in the Middle Ages, it served as a summer retreat for fabled Queen Tamar. Since 1996, the traditional towers of upper Svaneti have been protected as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. One can get to Mestia from Tbilisi and Zugdidi by a mini van. They all go via Zugdidi.

205,Rezo Gabriadze Puppet Theater,"Tbilisi, Georgia","A small but hugely whimsical theater where marionettes play out the ""The Battle of Stalingrad.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rezo-gabriadze-puppet-theater,"Opened in 1981, the Gabriadze Theater has become a much-loved part of Tbilisi’s cultural scene. It’s a small space with only 80 seats, but the puppets here don’t mess around, acting out high-brow dramas such as “The Autumn of Our Springtime” and “The Battle of Stalingrad.” The theater owes its entire existence to Revaz “Rezo” Gabriadze, a Georgian of many talents. During his life, he has worked as a theater and film director, playwright, writer, painter, and graphic artist. His 35 screenplays include the Soviet classics Don’t Grieve, Mimino, and Kin-Dza-Dza, all of which have ratings above 8.1 on IMDb. So, why puppets? Gabriadze was born in Kutaisi in what was then Soviet Georgia. He had lived his whole life under Soviet rule, and the lack of intellectual freedom was a continual hindrance to his artistic expression. Puppets became a surreptitious way to achieve a greater degree of artistic independence and a way to tell dramatic stories without drawing too much attention from his more authoritarian critics. The theater soon had five productions under way: Alfred and Violetta, The Autumn of Our Springtime, The Battle of Stalingrad, Ramona, and Diamond of Marshal de Fant’e. Locally, the performances were an instant hit. It wasn’t long before Gabriadze and his puppets were gaining international attention, after which they went on tour: to the Lincoln Center Festival in New York, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland, the Theater de la Ville in Paris,  Spain and Bogota, Toronto and London, Washington and Moscow. Few puppets have traveled so well. The shows, whether at home or on tour, are meant for an adult audience. The theater itself describes them as “mature puppet performances full of depth and meaning,” so a far cry from Punch and Judy and Howdy Doody. When The Battle of Stalingrad begins, tiny puppet tanks roll into battle to the sound of Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich. They may be marionettes, but this is seriously moving stuff. Attached to the theater, and built by Gabriadze in 2011, is one of the city’s most instantly recognizable landmarks: the Leaning Tower of Tbilisi.

206,Russia–Georgia Friendship Monument,Georgia,A cylinder monument with a spectacular vista commemorates a friendship that some say never existed.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/russiageorgia-friendship-monument,"The Treaty of Georgievsk between the Russian Empire and the east Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti in 1783 established Eastern Georgia as a protectorate of Russia. The king swore allegiance to the Russian emperor in return for protection and the support for the reigning Bagrationi dynasty. Just a few years later however, these promises proved worth very little. In 1795, when the Persian ruler Agha Mohammad Khan plundered the Georgian kingdom, the Russians did nothing to help. Their declaration of war on Persia and the deployment of troops to Transcaucasia came too late. It marked the beginning of years of tension between the neighboring nations. Nevertheless, the Russia–Georgia Friendship Monument was erected by the Soviets in 1983 in the mountains of northern Georgia. The famous Georgian architect Giorgi designed it and placed it on a spot offering a spectacular view over the surrounding landscape. The Soviet Union spent the year celebrating the bicentennial of the Treaty of Georgievsk. Several monuments were built to commemorate the treaty, but not everyone was happy with the festivities. Anti-Soviet Georgians held protests, and the underground publication Sakartvelo devoted a special issue which emphasized Russia’s disregard of the treaty. The massive round “friendship” monument still looks out over Devil’s Valley and the Caucasus Mountains. It is situated on the Georgian Military Highway between Gudauri, which is considered the best ski resort in Georgia, and Gergeti, where you can find the Gergeti Trinity Church. Inside the cylinder monument, a vibrantly colored mural depicts heavily stylized scenes from Georgian and Russian histories. Stone archways open up to Devil’s Valley, and offer an idyllic view for visitors, even if the name is potentially misleading.",communist monuments communist architecture soviet architecture soviet history politics war history monuments military
207,The Iveria,"Tbilisi, Georgia","Luxury hotel turned into a refugee camp, then turned back into a luxury hotel.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iveria-hotel,"At the geographic center of Georgia’s capital city Tbilisi, visible from every point in the city, stands the Iveria Hotel. In the 1960s, the large hotel was built as the prime hotel of the capital of the then Georgian Soviet Republic. Tbilisi was a favorite local tourist destination for the USSR’s elites, most notably because of the reputation of the city’s acclaimed thermal baths. When Georgia became independent, and relations with Russia became strained, Tbilisi’s tourism came to a sudden halt. But it wasn’t long until the Iveria hotel found a new, rather surprising purpose as a refugee camp. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Georgia stumbled into a number of violent conflicts, most notably the Abkhazia War – a brutally-fought conflict within the breakaway region of Abkhazia in the Northwest of the country. The war in Abkhazia led to the expulsion of ethnic Georgians, who searched for refuge in Tbilisi. Around 800 of the 200,000 IDPs in Georgia found a new home in the Iveria, which was effectively turned into a vertical refugee camp. It was highly unusual in that, unlike most refugee camps, this one was not located at a peripheral region but at the very heart of the capital city. Thus, the hotel became both a constant reminder and an epitomization of the country’s ongoing political problems. Even after the hottest stages of the Abkhazia War, the government of Georgia was extremely reluctant to relocate the refugees, since officials were afraid that a relocation could create new realities on the ground and lead to a permanent settlement of the refugees in the capital region. It wasn’t until the Rose Revolution in 2003 and the resignation of president Shevardnadze that the situation of the refugees of the Iveria Hotel changed. In 2004, they were relocated to the suburbs of Tbilisi, and the hotel was completely refurbished. In 2008, the hotel reopened as a luxury hotel under its new moniker Radisson Blu Iveria. For years, the colorful mosaic-like facade of the vertical refugee camp of the Iveria was one of the city’s most photographed objects. Today however, the modern glass facade of the hotel gives nothing away of its fascinating past. The Abkhazia Conflict is still unsolved, and the partial recognization of Abkhazia’s independence by Russia made the conflict even less likely to be solved anytime soon. The war’s refugees, who have been caught up in the middle of the warring sides, still live in temporary housing and long for their return to their homeland.",places to stay eccentric homes homes architectural oddities architecture
208,Krubera Cave,"Gagra, Georgia","The second-deepest known cave on Earth, hidden in an extremely remote mountain region.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/krubera-cave,"Since Jules Verne wrote his influential novel “Journey to the Center of the Earth,” the aim to discover the deepest place below the surface has sparked the imaginations of generations of explorers, adventurers and scientists. Those in search of the deepest known cave on the planet are always lead to Georgia’s breakaway region of Abkhazia. Deep in the mountains of the Arabika Massif, these record-breaking caves can be found—the four deepest caves in the world, including Krubera Cave (also known as Voronya Cave, just to keep it interesting), second-deepest in the world, to nearby Veryovkina Cave. The Arabika Massif in the Western Caucasus constitutes one of the largest karst massifs on Earth, but despite its enormous potential to scientists, the area, including Krubera Cave, has been woefully under-explored. One of the reasons is the remoteness of the area, which is only accessible for up to four months a year, but the main obstacles for scientists have been the numerous political conflicts in Abkhazia, which continue until today. Krubera Cave was declared the world’s deepest cave in 2001 when Ukrainian speleogolists reached a depth of 1,710 meters, thereby exceeding the previous known reigning champion in the Austrian Alps. At a depth of 1,500 meters, a subterranean waterfall of near-freezing water has flooded a branch of the cave system, while the main branch continues to a depth of 2,140 meters, where a terminal siphon marks the end of the cave. In 2018, Veryovkina Cave took over the title, at 2,212 meters deep—more than 1.3 miles. The Ukrainian speleogolists needed a staggering 14 days to reach the siphon at the end of the cave. A number of endemic fauna has been found at all levels of depth within the cave, including spiders, scorpions, beetles, as well as stygofauna like shrimps and amphipods.",geological oddities caves ecosystems geology
209,Stalin’s Underground Printing House Museum,"Tbilisi, Georgia",The secret room where early Bolsheviks cranked out propaganda fliers on a smuggled printing press.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stalins-underground-printing-house,"A nondescript, crumbling house in Georgia’s capital hides a series of tunnels where in 1904, a young communist printed magazines, pamphlets, and newspapers calling for the removal of the Tsar. At the time, Georgia was still part of the Russian Empire, and that young communist went by his given name, Iosif Djugashvili. The world would later come to know him as Joseph Stalin. Hidden beneath the house, a printing press—old even by the standards of 1906—was smuggled into Tbilisi in pieces by a network of Bolshevik supporters. For three years, the press clandestinely cranked out thousands of pamphlets written in Georgian, Russian, and Armenian. On the porch, lookouts—mostly women—would ring a bell if police were passing the house, a signal to those below to silence the noisy press. A series of tunnels led from the subterranean room to a nearby well, an escape route in anticipation of raids by Russian officials. By the time Stalin began working at the printing press, he was already robbing banks and running protection rackets to raise money to support the Bolsheviks. Some of that money went toward printing and distributing the materials from the press around the region. In 1906, three years after it printed its first pamphlet, the press was destroyed when the underground room was discovered. Thirty-one years later, Stalin had consolidated power in what had become the USSR. Under his government, the press was restored and the building turned into a museum that included a movie theatre that screened Soviet films. But in 1991, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the museum was abandoned. Today, the museum is operated by the Communist Party of Georgia, but it receives no money from the state. The printing press is caked in rust and the museum itself is largely in disrepair. But in recent years, the story of Stalin’s printing press has found a new audience: Chinese tourists.  The printing press is located within the Georgian Communist Party headquarters on Kaspi Street in Avlabari district, a 600-meter walk from the 300 Aragveli Metro Station. Soso, the caretaker, lives on the property and is there every day to open the museum up for visitors. If you want to call ahead, his phone number is 571721879.

210,Ananuri,Georgia,"This architecturally eclectic fortress witnessed centuries of bloody turmoil, including the massacre of its ruling clan.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ananuri,"Ananuri, a castle complex perched along the turquoise waters of the Aragvi River, is a prime example of Georgia’s unique blended architectural aesthetic. It was home to the Aragvi feudal dynasty during the 18th century, and was the staging grounds of numerous battles that Georgians both won and lost. It’s a miracle the complex still stands today, given all the battles it hosted. The fortress, which dates to the 17th century, bore witness to centuries of battles, the massacre of the Aragvi clan, multiple peasant revolts, and fire. After surviving  hundreds of years of turmoil, the complex eventually fell out of use in the 19th century. Though it’s a shell of what it was when the Dukes of Aragvi occupied it, the fortress is still worth exploring. It holds two castles joined by a curtain wall once used for defense and three churches. The largest church bears a traditional Georgian Orthodox grapevine cross carved into its facade and frescoes that were largely destroyed in a fire. These design elements, among others, illustrate the stylistic blend that is Georgian architecture, calling to mind structures from the classical Greco-Roman, Byzantine, and Persian Empires. There’s a reason the fortress is such a hodgepodge of architectural styles. Before Georgia gained its independence and reputation as a wellness hub due to its mineral springs loaded with naturally occurring sulfur, the capital city of Tbilisi was a point of contention, largely because of its proximity to the Silk Road, an ancient network of trade routes that connected the East and West. Unsurprisingly, the Silk Road attracted people from all over engaged in foreign commerce and invested in political expansion. As a result, a myriad of cultures and languages crossed through Tbilisi, which ultimately influenced Georgian architecture. Aside from the country’s mineral springs, Georgia attracts visitors interested in its plentiful historical and cultural monuments, to the tune of over 12,000. While only four of them are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Ananuri has been in the running to be the country’s fifth since 2007.  Many tour operators in Georgia offer packages that include a stop at the Ananuri Fortress complex. It's roughly 40 miles from Tbilisi, so it's easily doable as a day trip.",silk road crosses fortresses castles military history churches military sacred spaces architecture

At first glance, the museum, with its paintings and statues of the man, might seem to glorify one of the 20th century’s most notorious tyrants. But your tour guide will also quickly point to his mug shots from his early arrests for bank robbery; the recreation of a KGB interrogation room; and the map of Georgia with markers representing victims of his murderous reign. From his first desk in the Kremlin to his railroad car, the museum uses authentic items to tell the story of a dark time in history. Ironically, this memorial to the powerful Communist ends like other museums around the world – with a bit of capitalism. That’s right, at the exit to the Stalin museum, you’ll be invited into the gift shop, where you can purchase your very own coffee mug or other souvenir, featuring the smiling figure of “Uncle Joe.” (You can also pick up your own personal copy of “Poetry by J.

This subterranean wonder lets you slip into a world packed with gorgeous geological formations, making it feel like you’ve just stepped into nature’s own art gallery. Head underground, and you’ll enter a space full of fascinating cave formations and an underground river. Many of its impressive stalactites and stalagmites are dramatically lit, giving the cavernous space an eerie atmosphere. Keep an eye out for the one that’s in the shape of a giant human heart. The nature reserve holds some above-ground treasures, too. Before you enter the cave, you’ll come across the conservation building. There, you’ll find remarkably well-preserved dinosaur footprints. The footprints came from the various herbivores and raptors that once roamed this part of Georgia. The reserve also has an observation deck with transparent floors. Located at the highest point of the reserve, it offers sweeping views of the beautiful scenery. To reach the platform, you’ll get to walk along trails that wind through lush Colchic forest. The Sataplia Nature Reserve is named after the nearby Sataplia Mountain, which itself was named after the tradition of collecting honey from its resident bees. Its name translates to “place of honey.”  The entrance fee is 7GEL for Georgian citizens and 15GEL for foreigners. Guide service (in English, Russian, and Georgian language) is included.

213,Alaverdi Monastery Cellar,"Akhmeta, Georgia","Monks in the empyreal Alazani River valley have preserved their 1,000-year-old winemaking tradition.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alaverdi-monastery-cellar,"A visit to the Alaverdi Monastery, standing tall and solitary amidst the stunning Greater Caucasus Mountains, feels like stepping into paradise. Set against the backdrop of a tidal wave of clouds in an azure Georgian sky, this monastery was founded in the 6th century by an Assyrian monk named Joseph Alaverdeli. The current cathedral—of Georgian Orthodox denomination—was built in the 11th century by King Kvirike, ruler of the Kakheti region. From a distance, the monastery looks austere, like a fortress. Inside, the sprawling grounds have their own vineyards, growing over a hundred grape varietals; stone steps lead to open courtyards; monumental arches and high ceilings reveal ancient inscriptions and nearly-fading frescoes of the Virgin and holy child. Most visitors come to Alaverdi less for the divine than the Dionysian. Here, at the monastery’s marani, or wine cellar, monks have been making wine the way it’s been made in Georgia for over 8,000 years, in giant clay pots buried in the ground, called qvevri. The monks like to say that the heady fragrance of the wine emanates from these clay pots through the monastery’s compound. The original 11th century qvevri, aged and cracking at the mouth, is still on display. At the time, the monastery was making between 2,000 and 4,000 liters of wine annually. It is unclear when wine production at Alaverdi stopped, but after archeological remains of the original qvevris were dug up, the cellar was slowly restored and winemaking began anew in 2006. The five monks working at the marani have produced hundreds of thousands of bottles of wine since. The traditional wooden press where winemakers crushed grapes with their feet still stands at the marani. It looks a bit like a dugout canoe, and is made from the trunk of an entire tree. The famous Georgian amber-colored wines are made by putting crushed grapes, skin and all, into the qvevri pots, and leaving them to ferment naturally, a process that takes six months. The pots are sealed with fresh clay, then covered with sand and stones, so no moisture gets in. Several brick circles on the polished stone floor of the cellar mark the spots where the qvevris have been buried. When the monks open the qvevri after six months (usually in the spring), the mushy grape sediment has sunk to the bottom. These days, the monastery cellar also makes wines in steel tanks and oak barrels. The qvevri-made wines are highly tannic, due to contact with the grape skins. They tend to have a nuttiness, with top notes of apricot and peach, and an earthy aroma akin to a hike through a forest. They are bottled with the signature label of the cellar, all of them stating “since 1011,” the year the first wines were made. The monks like to say that the ideal timeline of wine enjoyment is to make it when a child is born and drink it when the child gets married.  The monastery organizes daily wine tours, which must be booked in advance.",ancient foods cloistered comestibles wine monasteries

The giant cave system, located inside of Mount Iberia, was known to locals before it was discovered by the world at large in 1961 when it was named after the nearby town. It was discovered to consist of nine massive chambers comprising a cumulative volume of over a million cubic meters, making it the second largest cave in the world. The cave proved to hold a number of features including underground rivers, staggeringly large stalactites and stalagmites, and deep ravines. Each of the giant sections was given a unique name and after the exploration was finished, the cave was opened to the public. Unfortunately moving people through such a colossal space proved to be an issue. To rectify the problem a short railway was set up in the cave system in 1975 looking not unlike a metro subway. The train, known as “Turist” travels to three stops along its subterranean route, passing through huge, unfinished cave areas between stops. There are opportunities to exit the train and explore the caves via long railed walkways, which pass by rock formations that have been illuminated by colored lights. Not all portions of the huge caves are open to visitors, but with such a massive amount of space to try and comprehend it’s hard to imagine anyone noticing that the caves are actually bigger than they can see.",subways subterranean subterranean sites caves ecosystems

The vaults are at the center of most of the stories, which is hardly surprising: They’re stacked with the bones of a now-vanished village’s dead. According to one legend, when the Black Death spread to this region, the village of Anatori was hit hard and fast and couldn’t care for all its sick. Rather than infect their family and friends, those who fell ill took it upon themselves to perish in isolation. They went, of their own free will, to die in vaults built a distance away. Once there, the doomed lay upon stone shelves while waiting for their eventual demise, accompanied only by those who were also dying. Once there were no more vacant vaults, the ill faced their fates surrounded by the bodies of those already dead. Now, steel grates guard the entrance and windows of the vaults, apparently to stop people from stealing bones. But the dead weren’t always offered such protections. Locals tell stories of a time before there were grates, when a Russian woman was seen crossing the Arghuni River and collecting all the skulls from the vaults in a sack before making her way back across the border. This area of Georgia is wild and remote. Pagan “Ram’s Head” churches can still be found locally and its proximity to Chechnya (a Russian republic) only adds fuel to the story’s fire. Trips in a 4 x 4 can be arranged from Tbilisi. If driving independently, it can be a difficult journey on the dangerous Georgian Military Road over the Jvari Mountain Pass. The road can be blocked at any given time due to heavy snow, rain, rock falls, and avalanches. Nevertheless, it's a spectacular journey.",plague disease villages catacombs and crypts death legends

After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early ’90s, various countries began to form and celebrated their newfound independence. Abkhazia, which had been part of Georgia during Soviet rule, sought to gain their own independence as well, but Georgia, also newly autonomous, fought bitterly with them over the region. From 1992 to 1993, thousands of ethnic Georgians fled or were killed in the Abkhazia region, buildings were destroyed, and the once prosperous seaside region fell into a state of disrepair that has yet to recover even today. One of the bloodiest battles during the Georgian-Abkhaz war took place at the former Council of the Ministries building, located in the very center of Sukhumi. Tank shells and bullets flew, and at one point the building was gutted by flames. The Georgians of Sukhumi were brutally massacred by the Abkhaz in an effort to retain control of the region, though there are some suggestions the violence was instead carried out by Russian supporting forces. Today the building remains abandoned, unfenced and accessible to the public. A sad reminder of the recent war and what was lost, it is also a good example of Soviet Brutalist architecture style.  Getting to the abandoned Council of Ministries Building is actually fairly easy; getting into Abkhazia is the difficult part. You must apply for a visa through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website in order to be granted access to Abkhazia in the first place. Once you receive your visa, you can cross the Inguri border which is a lengthy process and then you can head into Abkhazia. Don't forget to register your visa once there or you will receive an excessive fine. If you come to visit the Council of Ministries Building from the Russian side, you are unable to enter into Georgia from Abkhazia.

The auto museum is actually a private collection of cars and some motorcycles owned by a Georgian businessman named Giorgi Mamulashvili, who has been collecting cars for nearly two decades and has over 25 vintage vehicles in his current warehouse.

Located amid the sulfur baths of the city’s ancient Abanotubani district, down the road from a church and synagogue, this simple red brick mosque is known for being a place of worship for both Sunni and Shia Muslims. The Tbilisi Mosque, as it is also called, has had many incarnations throughout its history. First built in the 1700s by the Ottoman Empire, it has been destroyed and rebuilt three times over the past 300 years. Its most recent transformation, however, has been in the composition of its worshippers. After the bloody Russian Revolution in 1917, the newly formed government of the Soviet Republic set out to radically reform the former Russian Empire. One of the main goals of the new Communist state was to strip religious institutions of their power. The main target of these crackdowns was Russian Orthodox Church, which had enjoyed special privileges under the Tsar, and the Church’s land and property was aggressively confiscated. Muslim communities were initially given more leeway, but no religion was safe from the new government’s push to become the center of its citizens’ lives. About 10 percent of Georgia’s population is Muslim, and until 1951 there were two mosques in Tbilisi. Like everywhere else in the world, Sunni and Shia Muslims in Tbilisi worshipped separately, at the Jumah Mosque and the Blue Mosque, respectively. But in 1951 the Blue Mosque was demolished by the Communist government to make way for a bridge. Recognizing that the Shia community had nowhere to go, the Jumah Mosque opened its doors to them, making it one of the only mosques in the world where the two sects worship together. Until 1996, a black curtain was used to divide the mosque between Sunnis and Shiites during worship, but today, the two sects worship side by side. The mosque is located next to the Orbeliani bathhouse, whose beautiful tile mosaic facade makes it an attraction in its own right.",bath house mosques religion sacred spaces history

With an architectural style that in most cases would be considered dull even for functional buildings, the lack of creativity at border checkpoints is quite surprising given the fact that a land border often gives visitors their first impression of a country. While architects around the globe are quick to turn air and sea borders into showcases of progressiveness, land borders have largely been excluded from this trend. The border checkpoint at the village of Sarpi, which marks the boundaries between Georgia and Turkey, is a refreshing exception to this rule. Located directly on the shingle beach of the Black Sea, this iconic gleaming white and futuristic structure gives visitors a first glance at the progressive boom country that is bursting with energy and creativity. The lofty building houses a cafeteria, staff rooms, and a conference room, while the undulating tower is used as a viewing platform. The interior of the building is light and airy, just like the exterior. Altogether, the Sarpi Border Checkpoint is the perfect antidote to the well-known, often depressing border checkpoint buildings found anywhere else on Earth.

Designed and planned by a group of German and Georgian architects, the building is not meant to be a grand metropolitan transport hub, but an iconic little waystation that helps connect the historic region with Tbilisi. The airport was named after Queen Tamar of Georgia who ruled the country from 1184 to 1213. Looking like a naturally reclining “j” shape, the structure combines control tower and terminal in one smooth curve. While it looks like the ultra-modern work of an experimental architect, the building was created to invoke the image of Mestia’s famous historic watch-towers, known as “Svan Towers.” The airport is serviced by United Airports Georgia, the national company that oversees air travel facilities in the region.

The entrance to this vertical cave system lies between two mountains—Fortress and Umbrella—in the Arabika Massif of the Western Caucasus. This remote place is tough to access, and it took dozens of speleological expeditions and 50 years for it to finally claim the record, in 2018, when members of Moscow-based speleological clubs reached its depths.

Set on a rolling hill at the entrance to Sno village, a short detour off the Georgian Military Highway, these massive works of art are impossible to miss. The sculptures are the work of artist Merab Piranishvili, who graduated from the Tbilisi Art Academy in 1977 before returning to his home village to embark on his magnum opus. Piranishvili’s first and largest sculpture, a portrait of St. George, was completed in 1984. Six more stone heads have since been added to this collection, each one depicting a different figure from Georgian history or the arts: Shota Rustaveli, Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Vazha Pshavela, Alexandre Kazbegi. The newest member of the lineup is Jesus Christ. Each head is carved from a single block of granite. The stone was locally sourced and relocated to Sno. Chins tilted skywards towards the mountains beyond, the stone heads cut a striking figure. Piranishvili’s goal is to carve 500 heads in total for his open-air museum. He hopes it will attract more tourists to visit Sno on their way to Stepantsminda and Gergeti Trinity Church.  Sno village is located 90 miles north of Tbilisi along the Georgian Military Highway. To find the sculptures, take the turnoff before Stepantsminda towards Achkhoti and Juta Valley. The heads are located two miles off the main highway. Entrance to the area is free. While you’re there, cross the small river to visit the 16th-century Sno Castle.",outsider art sculptures history & culture
224,Gveleti Waterfall,Georgia,Hidden up a dusty track off the Georgian Military Road is this fascinating waterfall with mountainous views.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gveleti-waterfall,"The majority of tourists who visit the Kazbegi region in Northern Georgia travel to see the Gergeti Trinity Church, a famous church amid the backdrop of the spectacular Caucasus Mountains. Those who travel the short distance further up the Georgian Military Road are rewarded with this truly magnificent waterfall. Translated into English, Gveleti means “places of snakes,” a reminder to be aware of the wildlife in the area. Those who visit are often able to spot eagles, hawks, and Griffon vultures swooping through the steep valleys. Located a little over four miles (seven kilometers) from the town of Stepantsminda, the journey along the road to this waterfall allows travelers to also view the Dariali Gorge. There is a turn off the main road onto a smaller dirt road which is signposted. This road ventures past several abandoned cabins. Less than a mile up the road, it forks into two branches. Take the branch on the right. A stone with a red arrow guides visitors to the Gveleti Waterfall. About 10 minutes after crossing a small bridge over the river, visitors will spot the water cascading off the steep cliffs.  To get from Stepanstminda to the Gveleti Waterfalls there are no public transport links. The best way to get there is usually by taxi. There are many taxi drivers who wait in the small square in Stepanstminda and will offer competing prices to get to the starting point of the trail. The majority of drivers will offer to wait at the bottom while you take your time to take in the waterfalls and the surrounding mountains. There is a smaller waterfall which is also worth viewing if in the area. To see this, take the left turn at the fork and carry on up the smaller footpath.",waterfalls mountains water nature
225,Alphabetic Tower,"Batumi, Georgia","Tower with a double-helix spiral, adorned with letters of the Georgian alphabet.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alphabetic-tower,"DNA is the alphabet of humanity. Its structure, information, and interactions form the language through which life grows and develops. This is the concept behind the Alphabetic Tower in Batumi, Georgia. Already a major tourist attraction for Georgians and Eastern Europeans at large, the harbor town of Batumi wanted to create a landmark that symbolized the journey of the Georgian people, not only in terms of modern history but also throughout time as members of the human race. Thus Alphabetic Tower combines the structural design of DNA, in its familiar double helix pattern, and the language of the Georgia, with each rung on the ladder of the double helix displaying an individual and unique letter in the Georgian alphabet. Both a work of public art and a memorable addition to the landscape of the tourist town, the design seems to achieve its purpose: giving people to at once marvel at and be proud of, and giving visitors a reason to remember this special place, both as tourists and as part of something larger. It also provides a great view of the city and surrounding areas from the observation deck.",outsider architecture Unique Restaurants & Bars architectural oddities architecture
226,Bridge of Peace,"Tbilisi, Georgia","With over 10,000 lights, this engineering marvel lights up the city after dark.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bridge-of-peace,"Officially opened in 2010, this impressive bridge designed by Italian architect Michele de Lucchi connects the historic old town of Tbilisi to the west and Rike Park to the east. The modern design of this bridge over the Mtkvari river received mixed reactions. Locals and several well-known politicians and public figures criticized the structure for its extravagant design against the backdrop of the historical landmarks in the old town. The bridge stretches more than 400 feet (150 meters) across the river. A walk across provides a great view in both directions, capturing many of the city’s sights such as the Metekhi Church and the iconic statue of King Vakhtang Gorgasali. The bridge is composed of many large curved, steel beams with multiple glass panels. Around each panel are multiple LED lights that make the bridge an iconic sight during sunsets.  This bridge sits in a central position in Tbilisi and can be taken in on an extended walk from Rike Park over to the historic old town, taking in many sights as you go. Several companies offer riverboat tours which allow visitors to get a different perspective of the impressive bridge.",bridges design architecture
227,Vank Bell Tower,"Tbilisi, Georgia",When the Soviets destroyed the historic Armenian monastery they somehow left its bell tower intact.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vank-bell-tower,"This historic bell tower originally stood next to an unusual triple-nave and triple-cupola cathedral, which was the seat of the Armenian archbishop. The church was the largest in Tbilisi at the time it was demolished in 1930 upon the orders of the infamous Soviet leader Lavrentiy Beria, along with a number of other churches in Tbilisi. Beria went on the head the Soviet secret police (the predecessor organization to the KGB) during World War II, and later joined the USSR’s Politburo. The cathedral complex he ordered destroyed was originally founded by an Armenian immigrant in the 14th century and was called the Holy Mother of God of Mens Monastery, as well as Pashavank, or just Vank, which means “monastery” in Armenian. The surviving belltower now stands almost forgotten behind some larger buildings that obscure it from the main road, which is just steps away. Many houses have sprouted up around the freestanding belfry, but it has not been harmed and still soars above the neighboring homes.  An open gate about 40 feet (12 meters) from the bell tower allows access to the courtyard and the base of the tower.",belltowers cathedral soviet history world war ii religion military sacred spaces ruins
228,Amra Pier,"Sokhumi, Georgia",A beautiful but deteriorating monument of Soviet architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amra-pier,"The Amra Restaurant was built in the 1960s on the top tier of the Amra Pier in the Abkhaz capital city of Sokhumi, where it was a popular hangout place for the local upper crust. The restaurant was frequented by prominent actors, artists, and authors, including the renowned Soviet writer Fazil Iskander, who frequently mentioned the Arma Pier in his works. At the time, the pier was a beautifully decorated monument of Soviet architecture. Today it is badly deteriorating and partially closed due to large chunks of it falling into the sea. Nevertheless, there is still a small cafe on the top deck, and people can be seen wandering around the pier quite happily despite huge holes in the floor and more than a few missing support struts underneath. Even in its current crumbling state, it’s easy to imagine this place in its heyday. It must have been quite spectacular.",soviet architecture soviet history restaurants ruins architecture
229,Berikaoba Sculpture Group,"Tbilisi, Georgia",A lively circle of dancers in the Georgian capital commemorates an ancient rite of spring.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berikaoba-sculpture,"Just west of the River Mtkvari, not far from the famous Rezo Gabriadze Puppet Theater and Tbilisi’s oldest surviving church, the Anchiskhati Basilica of St. Mary, you’ll find a sculpture of exuberant dancers, frozen in a circle. Each smiling, lively dancer in the circle is unique. Together they are an homage to an ancient tradition: the spring ritual known as Berikaoba. Before becoming one of the first nations to convert to Christianity, in the early fourth century, Georgia was a tapestry of pagan cultures, including Zoroastrianism, Hellenism, and many more. While the specific tradition in which Berikaoba originated during this period remains unclear, it was a festival to welcome spring fertility and good fortune through the year. During the celebration, elaborately masked berikas paraded through villages demanding goods like eggs and wine. Providing the items to them ensured a productive and prosperous spring. The parade was followed by feasting, wrestling and games. Thousands of years later, the tradition has faded; only a few villages in Kakheti, the eastern corner of the country, still celebrate Berikaoba. The sculpture, created by Avtandil Monaselidze and erected in 1981, serves as a reminder that Georgian culture as a whole has always been a melting pot of different traditions and religious customs.  The sculpture is accessible 24/7 and stands at the north edge of the oldest section of Tbilisi.",paganism dancing spring sculptures statues
230,Özlem Shipwreck,"Batumi, Georgia",A shipwreck named Desire at the shore of Batumi.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oezlem-shipwreck,"Shipwrecks are decidedly captivating and eery. Looming ghostlike deep beneath the water’s surface, resting motionless in the dark, from the world-famous to the unknown, they can be found close by nearly any shoreline. While most remain subsurface, silently resting beneath the waves and leaving the sparkling water above pristine and undisturbed, their inherently striking appearance is magnified in those rare instances when the wreck is above the surface. Whether it be part of a ship graveyard or simply the shell of a once-mighty vessel, forgotten after its use ran out, above water shipwrecks are a fascinating glimpse at something usually hidden from view. The Özlem (Turkish for “Desire”) is one such above-surface shipwreck at the shore of Batumi, Georgia’s main coastal town. The Turkish tanker ran ashore near the Black Sea port, and has remained in the exact spot where it “sank,” half-crippled, during the ensuing years. Broken in the center, the tanker’s middle part sank into the murky water, leaving its ends to jut out of the water – a colorful tragedy that attracts an ever-growing number of curiosity seekers. Local kids use the tanker’s remains as a diving board. In recent years the shipwreck has become a minor tourist attraction among holidaymakers in the coastal town. Update April, 2017: Local authorities removed the wreck a couple years ago.",shipwrecks ruins architectural oddities architecture
