0,Hand of Timba,"Bissau, Guinea-Bissau",This monument memorializes a violent massacre where colonial police killed 50 striking dockworkers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hand-of-timba,"A short walk from the Port of Bissau stands a large, fist-shaped sculpture known as the Mão de Timba (Hand of Timba). This monument along the Geba River commemorates a critical event in the history of Guinea-Bissau’s fight for independence. For centuries, the people of Guinea-Bissau lived under Portuguese colonial rule. Portuguese traders first showed up in the early 15th-century in what was then the kingdom of Kaabu, a region subordinate to the powerful Mali empire. In 1687, the Portuguese founded the city of Bissau on land that had belonged to the Papei people. The new colonial city grew into one of Portugal’s primary slave ports, which led to a massive stone fort being built there in 1753 to solidify Portuguese control of the city. When the international slave trade was outlawed in the 1830s, the city of Bissau began to decline. That is, until 1941 when the capital of Portuguese Guinea was moved from Bolama to Bissau. In the 1950s, Guinea-Bissau, like many African nations at the time, began organizing for independence from the Portuguese colonizers. In 1956, the poet, agricultural engineer, revolutionary, and diplomat Amílcar Cabral established the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). At its outset, the group’s mission was to achieve independence through non-violent means. One of PAIGC’s first major acts was to help organize a peaceful strike for better salaries at the Pidjiguiti Docks of the Port of Bissau. On August 3, 1959, sailors and dockworkers halted all operations at the port. Soon after, a colonial police force, the International and State Defense Police (PIDE), was called in to remove the strikers and regain control of the port. When PIDE broke through the port’s locked gate, they opened fire on the large crowd of strikers, killing 50 people and injuring hundreds. They also arrested and tortured numerous strikers. For Cabral, the episode demonstrated that independence wouldn’t be achieved through peaceful means. A little over a month later, on September 19, 1956, PAIGC declared a fight for independence “by all possible means, including war.” For more than a decade, Cabral led PAIGC’s guerrilla movement against the Portuguese colonial government until independence was finally achieved in 1974. The Hand of Timba monument commemorates the dockworkers who were among the first to lose their lives in Guinea-Bissau’s war for independence. The clenched hand represents a swindler, someone who does intend to pay their debts—in this case, Portuguese colonizers who refused to pay dockworkers fair wages. Two other monuments nearby also commemorate the event: an anchor inscribed with the names of fallen dockworkers and a newly installed bust of Amílcar Cabral. The anniversary of the Pidjiguiti Massacre, August 3rd, is a national holiday in Guinea-Bissau.",The Hand of Timba monument is in Praça dos Martires off of Avenida do 3 de Agosto between Avenida Amilcar Cabral and Avenida Domingos Ramos.
1,Presidential Palace,"Bissau, Guinea-Bissau","Built by Portuguese colonizers, the palace is now the seat of power for the independent nation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/presidential-palace-guinea-bissau,"Located in the heart of the capital city of Bissau, the pink-hued Presidential Palace has borne witness to much of the country’s history. Portuguese colonizers originally built the palace. At the time, it was one of the largest buildings in Bissau. But since Guinea-Bissau gained independence in 1974, the palace has been the home of the country’s sitting president. [Delete: When it was built, the palace was one of the largest buildings in Bissau. It long stood as a symbol of Portuguese oppression, but was remade into a symbol of independence after 1974.] During the 1998-1999 Guinea-Bissau Civil War, the palace was bombed and fell into disarray for more than a decade. A colony of bats moved into the palace shell. In 2013, the Chinese government helped to fund the restoration of the palace putting a total of $8 million into the project. The palace reopened in 2015. At the ceremony, Prime Minister Rui Duarte Barros said, “China is the only partner which does not demand anything in return when it finances construction projects in our country. It’s a key partner.” China has also helped to fund other building projects in the country, including a courthouse, the parliament building, and a 20,000 seat stadium. In addition to being the president’s home, the palace is also used for government cabinet meetings.",The palace’s security is wary of people taking close-up photos of the building.
2,Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro,"Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast",The world's largest church atop a political fault line.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yamoussoukro,"In a country known best for civil war and political unrest, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace emerges tranquilly from the barren landscape surrounding the church on all sides. Despite its impressive stature, it remains shrouded in controversy from comparison and stands as a symbol of the problems facing the Ivory Coast. Construction began on the Basilica in 1985, just 25 years into the Ivory Coast’s remarkable and prosperous independent history. The Ivory Coast’s beloved leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny chose the location on the outskirts of Yamoussoukro. Houphouet-Boigny grew up in the city and led the country into stability since its independence in 1960. After the complex was finished in 1990, the basilica, which is modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, had cost over $300 million, and stood as the world’s largest church eclipsing the size of its inspiration in Italy. The complex is over 30,000 square meters and the dome rises over 500 feet into the air and can accommodate 18,000 worshippers. Although the Basilica gave the Ivory Coast international recognition, including Pope John Paul II’s blessing, its construction symbolized a larger problem that would plague the country over the next 20 years. In the vein of a monarchical France, the Basilica was in essence a statement of grandeur more fitting for Louis XIV’s riches than a prosperous but nascent democratic economy. Unlike St. Peters, the basilica is built on the outskirts of the city and is surrounded by marked poverty, dotting a barren and dusty landscape. By comparison to its surroundings, the Basilica loses its imposing beauty quickly. Less than a decade after its construction, the Ivory Coast was plunged into a series of civil wars, the most recent of which exploded between November 2010-April 2011 after failed elections in 2010. As Houphouet-Boigny quickly worked to build a lasting symbol of political tranquility in the twilight of his time in office, it became evident that stability was fleeting. Just as the newly independent government had stood as a symbol of hope in a struggling West African region of the 1970s and 1980s, the Basilica now stands as precarious hope and stability in a struggling Ivory Coast. Despite its renown and massive size, the basilica like its country, sits atop a political fault line, willing to devour it into the earth at the tiniest shake. As poor vendors peruse its borders selling cheap wares, the structure constantly begs the question of whether a permanent reminder of stability was too much too soon.",
3,Crocodile House,"Abidjan, Ivory Coast",Living inside a fearsome reptile in the Ivory Coast.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crocodile-house,"Thierry Atta is now fully moved into his new home. Situated in the midst of Abidjan, the former capital of the Ivory Coast, the architect’s home is actually a massive and grotesquely-smiling crocodile, completely hollowed out to create a living space inside of the reptile structure. Completed in 2008, the crocodile was actually the work of artist Moussa Kalo, who sadly died only two months before it was completed. As an apprentice of Kalo, Atta moved into the work the men had created, and has since made the crocodile his home. Including windows and a bed, the strange concrete house is completely livable, and is a joy to many people in the neighborhood who stop by the courtyard to smile and play by the eccentric home.",
4,Gedi Ruins,"Malindi, Kenya",Abandoned city hidden from the world by tropical forest and isolation on the coast of Kenya.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gedi-ruins,"The Gedi ruins are one of Kenya’s great mysteries. Set in an idyllic location on the Indian Ocean, and buried deep in a lush forest, the town was thought to have been founded in the early 13th-century, although hard evidence eludes most scientists. But what has really baffled researchers is the well-established town’s mysterious abandonment and incredible development. Left standing today are numerous coral-brick houses, a palace as well as an impressive mosque. However, it is not only the quality of the ruins that amazes visitors but the advanced nature of the settlement. Gedi was in many ways, a very advanced city with streets, running water and flushing toilets. Correcting the assumption that Africa was far behind the rest of the world before colonialism, Gedi was a cosmopolitan urban setting, and archeologists have found Ming Chinese vases, Venetian glass as well as other artifacts from all over the world. This potpourri of history is clear evidence that the Muslim inhabitants of the coastal Kenyan town traded heavily with cultures outside their own, and developed an incredible world that has now been deeply decomposed by tropical forests. Excavation has occurred since 1948, and the entire area is protected as a national park in Kenya.","Head north from Mombasa towards Malindi, Gedi is 65 miles north of Mombasa and about 10 miles south of Malindi."
5,Giraffe Manor,"Nairobi, Kenya","Just outside of Nairobi lies a large estate surrounded by endangered Rothschild giraffes, who have been fed from the window by Mick Jagger and Walter Cronkite.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giraffe-manor,"The Rothschild Giraffe is one of the most endangered giraffe subspecies in the entire world. They have gone extinct in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo and only remain in Kenya and Uganda, where their numbers are quite scarce. To try to combat this problem, the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife founded the Giraffe Center in 1979 with the intention of breeding Rothschild Giraffes on a 140 acre plot of land. Their attempt to increase the population of the giraffes and return them to national parks was a success. Since then they have been focusing on educating Kenyan youth about the importance of conservation. The founders of the Giraffe Center also needed a place to live, and there happened to be an ivy-covered, brick mansion located right in the middle of the breeding grounds. After residing there for a few years, the founders came up with a brilliant idea: turning the mansion into a luxurious 10-room hotel called “Giraffe Manor.” It couldn’t have been a better idea. Nowadays, Giraffe Manor is one of the most iconic and unique hotels in the world. Every morning, the giraffes from the Giraffe Center walk from their natural habitat to the windows of the Giraffe Manor to eat breakfast with the guests. Seriously. They either crane their necks down to reach the lower rooms or they stretch their necks up to reach the windows of the upper floor. They slurp up whatever is on the plate, with their faces right next to those the hotel guests. Since they have unrestricted roaming rights, this is purely by choice. When they’re done eating, they maneuver their heads out of the giant windows of Giraffe Manor and continue on with their normal lives.",
6,Nairobi Animal Orphanage,"Nairobi, Kenya","Located in Nairobi National Park, this animal orphanage is the oldest of its kind in Kenya.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nairobi-animal-orphanage,"Founded in 1964, the Nairobi Animal Orphanage houses and treats over 20 animal and bird species in need of rehabilitation after injury or abandonment. Lions, cheetahs, jackals, hyenas, ostriches, parrots, and more inhabit the orphanage, which welcomes over 200,000 visitors each year. The Nairobi Animal Orphanage is both a conservation facility for animals in need and an educational resource for the public—mainly school children who wouldn’t otherwise have an opportunity to see these animals in the wild. While it’s far from the majesty of seeing these creatures healthy in their natural habitats, each of the animals in the Nairobi Animal Orphanage has been taken in by park rangers to receive medical treatment before being placed in an individualized rehabilitation program for a second chance at life. The goal of the orphanage is to strengthen the animals so they may eventually be released back into the wild. The Nairobi Animal Orphanage is located just inside Nairobi National Park just 20 minutes from the center of Nairobi—billed by African Spice Safaris as the world’s only city which doubles as a safari capital for unbridled wildlife sightings. Day tours of the orphanage are available for booking.",The Nairobi Animal Orphanage is open seven days a week from 8am to 5pm.
7,Ali Barbour's Cave Restaurant,"Diani Beach, Kenya","Drink and dine in a coral cave that's at least 120,000 years old.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ali-barbours-cave-restaurant,"Visitors flock to Kenya’s Diani Beach for the white sands and ritzy resorts, but the setting sun reveals the splendor of another local gem, Ali Barbour’s Cave Restaurant. Diners enter through an unassuming, whitewashed facade, then descend 33 feet underground to enjoy their meals in an ancient coral cave with a wide mouth overhead for excellent stargazing. Located in a cave thought to be between 120,000 and 180,000 years old, Ali Barbour’s takes dining al fresco to a whole other dimension. In the evenings, the restaurant glows in the muted light of candles, and diners’ eyes are naturally drawn to the twinkling stars above. (Sliding covers are drawn to create a makeshift roof in inclement weather.) Founded by George and Jackie Barbour in the 1980s and named as a play on “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” the restaurant is designed to keep the natural elements of the cave intact, with only the kitchen and bathrooms modified for modern uses. Though the menu is international, seafood is the specialty. You can dine on a meal caught in the Indian Ocean, mere feet from your table, and possibly at the same sea level.","The restaurant opens daily at 6:30 p.m. and has a ""smart/casual"" dress code (i.e., no beachwear). Reservations are recommended."
8,Giraffe Centre,"Nairobi, Kenya",Get tall with nature's lankiest beasts and their warthog friends at this Kenyan preserve.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giraffe-centre,"Like the short-haired brontosauri of the modern day, giraffes are almost hilariously tall, and certainly don’t seem like the type of creatures one could feed snacks to, but at Kenya’s Giraffe Centre getting face-to-face with the gentle giant is the order of the day. The centre was opened in 1983, but its track record of preservation goes back years earlier. The project that would grow into the Giraffe Centre first began in 1979 by Jock and Betty Leslie-Manville who set out to save the nearly extinct Rothschild giraffe. The couple’s project began when they captured a baby giraffe and set out to establish a breeding program to repopulate the spotted creatures. The Leslie-Manville’s started to raise giraffes right on their own property, and soon the centre was born with the addition of a private education center. The repopulation project took off and the centre was able to reintroduce fertile giraffe couples to a number of Kenyan national parks. Of course they still kept a number of the animals at their center. The Giraffe Centre opened to the public in the early eighties and is now simply part of a larger non-profit organization, the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife (Kenya) Ltd. Visitors can come to the centre and actually get right up into the faces of the giraffes via raised walkways. The animals can be fed little snack pellets and might even reciprocate with a lick with their big purple tongues. Adorable and gross. A number of warthogs also roam the grounds.",
9,Kitum Cave,Kenya,A salty cave excavated by elephants and the location of a deadly disease vector.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kitum-cave,"When the Kitum Cave was first discovered, the many marks, scratches, and furrows along its walls were assumed to have been the work of picks wielded by ancient Egyptians searching for gold or diamonds. In fact, the excavated sections of the cave are the result of something much more unusual. The cave is found on Mount Elgon, an extinct shield volcano, and it developed as the result of cooling volcanic rock. The cave, which extends some 600 feet into the mountain, has walls that are rich in salt, and it is here that the mysterious cave diggers reveal themselves. Each night for hundreds (possibly thousands) of years, animals have traveled into the cave in the dead of night to use it as a giant salt lick. Buffaloes, antelope, leopards, hyenas, and most of all elephants bumble blindly through the cave (the elephants often bump their heads in the process), making their way to the salty walls of the cave. It is the elephants that have done the digging. Using their massive tusks, the elephants pull off chunks of the walls to crush and lick up the salt. Over the centuries this has resulted in a noticeable increase in the size of the cave as well as walls that are covered in tusk marks. The trip to the depths of the cave is not without its dangers; there is a deep crevasse into which many younger, more inexperienced elephants have fallen, leaving behind an elephant graveyard. The Kitum Cave is more recently famous for a very different sort of lifeform: a deadly virus. In 1980 and again in 1987, visitors to the cave contracted Marburg virus, a deadly virus similar to Ebola. The cave and Marburg virus rose to notoriety when they were featured in the 1994 bestseller The Hot Zone. It is believed that bats in the cave are carriers of the virus, and that their powdered guano may act as the disease vector.",
10,Marafa Depression,"Malindi, Kenya","Strange sandstone canyon known as the ""place broken by itself.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marafa-depression,"The Marafa Depression, also known as Hell’s Kitchen, is an odd sandstone canyon outside of Malindi, Kenya. Known locally as Nyari - “the place broken by itself” - it was once a great sandstone ridge worn by wind, rain, and floods into a series of jagged gorges. The layer-cake colors of the sandstone reveal whites, pinks, oranges, and deep crimsons, making the gorge particularly striking at sundown, when tones of the ribbed sandstone gullies are highlighted and mirrored by those of the setting sun. Naturally, local stories accompany the “place broken by itself.” According to legend, there was once a town located where the gorge is now. One day, all the town’s inhabitants received a vision telling them a miracle was coming and to move their town. Everyone moved except one old woman who refused to leave. The abandoned town then supposedly vanished - with the remaining woman still inside - leaving the Marafa Depression in its place.",
11,Mara River Crossing,Kenya,Life and death are on parade at the most reliably perilous site of “the Great Migration.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mara-river-crossing,"One of Earth’s most spectacular wildlife events takes place each year in the heart of eastern Africa, culminating at a river crossing where nature coldly decides who lives to see another season. Dubbed “The Great Migration,” 1.5 million wildebeest, zebras, and gazelle follow a circular migratory route throughout the Serengeti and Maasai Mara ecosystems, fraught with a series of river passages whose raging currents and predatory beasts lurking in the shallows make the endeavor more than just a simple swim. After having forded the formidable Grumeti River in Tanzania, the remaining herd makes its way north from July through October to meandering Mara River. Along its banks, the wildebeest queue up as far as they eye can see, waiting to take the season’s final plunge in hopes of finding promise greener grasses – and, new studies show, better drinking water – on the other side. Before they can get there, throngs of hungry crocodiles lie in wait. For the wildebeest, getting to the other side alive is a lot like a very dangerous, inescapable game of roulette. Carcasses of those who didn’t make it litter the Mara’s banks. Vultures feast on what the crocodiles left behind. Immortalized by Attenborough, such scenes of Nature ruthlessly sorting animals into those who live and those who die has become at once inspiring and macabre. No wonder the Mara crossing has become the kind of place travelers wait lifetime to visit in person. It is the world’s most quintessential struggle, played out in realtime, before one’s eyes… and among few places on the planet where it can be witnessed reliably, year after year.","The timing of the migration varies slightly form year to year depending on the rains, however the migration is usually in the Mara from late July to early October, and July/August is the peak time when most of the animals are in the Mara. If you want to see the migration at other times of year, you will need to go to Tanzania to see then in the Serengeti.If you are keen to see a river crossing then you will need to be careful when booking your lodge, as many places are 2-3 hours from the river crossings. The further away you are from the river, the more of your game drive will be taking up by travelling...or example, if you stay at a lodge 3 hours from the river you will need to spend 6 hours just driving to and from the river from your accommodation. Lodges nearer the river are more expensive, however you will have a much better chance of seeing a river crossing as you can spend longer at the river."
12,Kitengela,"Nairobi, Kenya",A glass and sculpture wonderland forms an oasis in a remote part of Kenya.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kitengela,"When German art brut exponent Nani Croze settled in the desert across the road from Nairobi National Park in the 1970s, she had no reprieve from the scorching Kenyan sun. There were few trees, so the artist began making sculptures to create shade. “[It] started as a pioneer homestead and grew into an oasis,” Croze has said. Now, the Kitengela settlement is a community, a glassworks, a hotel, and a sculpture garden that’s something like a cross between the splendorous architecture of Antoni Gaudí and a Hobbit village. The settlement is a wonderland with hidden works of art around every corner. The sculptures depict a fantastical world filled with dragons, butterflies and abstract, multicolored giants. In spite of the fact that every staircase and windowsill has been painted and molded to the artists’ satisfaction, Kitengela appears to have grown organically out of the earth. Kitengela’s purpose is to improve the community. Its most obvious contribution is aesthetic beauty, but it also gives back in more tangible ways. Croze has partnered with hospitals and charities, giving away her own work and lessons. The materials used in Kitengela’s sculptures is all found and recycled, and they are as likely to be built by creative locals as by professional artists. Croze also hosts workshops and apprenticeships at Kitengela, some geared specifically for women to learn the art of glassmaking and mosaic. Kitengela has turned into a sort of commune—the studio on the property employs about 50 people, many of whom live there with their families as well. Visitors are also welcome to stay at Kitengela. Croze has several cottages available for short-term rentals, but be warned: None are free of animal life. Kitengela has its own pigs, ducks, and geese, but given that the community is adjacent to a national park, baboons, giraffes, and ostriches are just as commonly seen.",

Twice making the world’s 50 best restaurants by Restaurant Magazine, Carnivore opened in 1980 to immediate popularity. Borrowing aesthetic from medieval banquet halls, the decor is indoor/outdoor with tropical plants and streams weaving around tables. A giant roasting pit resides near the entrance of the building, covered in traditional Maasai swords ladened with hunks of meaty goodness from just about every animal you can think of that’s not on the endangered species list. Constantly being turned and basted over the pit are selections of the likely suspects at any BBQ–chicken wings, spare ribs, lamb, and different cuts of pork and beef. For the more adventurous there are bolder choices, such as camel, crocodile, tasty kidney morsels, and mutura, a local sausage consisting of cow or goat meat, tripe, and cooled blood seasoned with onions, salt, pepper, and chili. After being seated and served some gratuitous soup and bread and introduced to a double-decker revolving tray of exotic sauces, the diners are then inundated with servers carrying the meat-encumbered Maasai swords, offering the succulent outside cut of whatever strikes the customers fancy. Truly a practice in excess, visitors are encouraged to continue shoving food down their gullets until they can take no more, signaling their surrender by lowering a white flag provided for them in the center of the table. When the servers have been alerted to their victory, they will then bring around desert and coffee to those who are up to the challenge. Besides the meat orgy, Carnivore also has a nightclub, gardens, a playground for children, signature cocktails, an events area, an African heritage gallery, and believe it or not, a vegetarian menu.",Near Wilson Airport
14,Bomas of Kenya,"Nairobi, Kenya",This tourist village in Nairobi celebrates the traditional lifestyles and customs of Kenyan tribes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bomas-of-kenya,"Billed as “Kenya in miniature,” Bomas of Kenya is a tourist village and cultural center six miles outside of Nairobi. It features replicas of traditional homesteads, or bomas, from 23 of Kenya’s ethnic groups, as well as traditional dances performed in its large auditorium. Bomas of Kenya was founded by the Kenya Tourist Development Cooperation in 1971. It was conceived and planned by Barack Obama Sr., although you won’t find any mention of him on the official website. Despite being the driving force behind the project, Obama Sr. was fired in controversial circumstances, his superiors unhappy at what they saw as his overuse of unilateral decision making. Despite the acrimonious beginning, the center went on to become a successful celebration of more than 40 ethnic groups in Kenya. The name of the tourist village comes from the Swahili word boma, meaning homestead, referring to the 23 replica villages found on the site, each displaying the unique characteristics of their respective ethnic group. At first glance, these round huts all appear much the same. But on further inspection, important and distinct social structures emerge. The organization of the various homesteads reveals telling details about the particular ethnic group. For example, the planning of homesteads in polygamous groups reflects this distinct hierarchy (first wife’s hut, second wife’s hut etc.). In other homesteads, the size and distribution of granaries reveals the responsibilities and importance of particular family members. Different construction methods, and forms of partitioning and decorations within homes, also vary between groups, highlighting important cultural differences. Along with the homesteads, one other key structure at Bomas of Kenya is the 3,000-capacity auditorium, one of the largest of its kind in Africa. Build in the shape of an African hut, the auditorium hosts daily song and dance performances from many of Kenya’s ethnic groups. These represent a diverse tribal cultural spectrum, and include everything from Kalenjin warrior dances to Swahili taarab music and Kikuyu circumcision ceremonies (minus the actual circumcision). Completing the cultural showcase is the Utamaduni Restaurant, where traditional Kenyan gastronomy is celebrated with dishes from various parts of the country.","Bomas of Kenya is located about six miles from Nairobi’s city center, and not far from the main entrance to Nairobi National Park. The bomas (homesteads) are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Performances take place Monday to Friday from 2:30 p.m. to 4 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. on weekends and during public holidays.

The structure is an interesting blend of colonial and indigenous techniques. It’s a showcase of Renaissance military architecture built with locally available coral stone and lime mortar worked on using local techniques. Fort Jesus was completed in 1596. It was commissioned by King Philip I of Portugal and designed by renowned architect Giovanni Battista Cairati In the subsequent 300 years, the fort changed hands at least 10 times, with the Portuguese, Swahilis, Omani Arabs, and eventually British vying to own it. Possession of this strategic fort indicated the power a given government had in controlling trade over the Indian Ocean. The original walls, which were designed to withstand cannon balls, used to be nearly 50 feet (15 meters) high, and the Omanis increased their height by nine feet. Eventually, the walls were used to not only keep invaders out, but to keep people in as well. The British converted the fort into a prison in 1895, and it served this purpose until 1958, when it was declared a national monument. And in 2011, the fort became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fort in its current form is an amalgamation of European, African, and Middle-Eastern building styles, which blend seamlessly. The ramparts offer an expansive view of the Port of Mombasa. The rooms of the fort now house a museum shedding light to the history of the fort and Mombasa.",The museum is open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. You can find a map of its various exhibits here.

Founded in 1370, it is the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in the country, and has largely remained unchanged over the centuries. The streets are narrow—often no more than two shoulder lengths in width—meaning that traversing the island by car is impossible. Instead, there are donkeys—more than 6,000 of them, used for transporting goods and people through the town. So important are these animals that the largest nonprofit on the island is a donkey sanctuary and one of the two cars on the island is an ambulance for donkeys. Each year the Lamu Cultural Festival celebrates the animals with a donkey race down the island’s beaches. Crowds of thousands gather to watch the local donkey jockeys compete head to head for the title. Strategically located along ancient trade routes between the Middle East and South Asia, Lamu Island was once the most important trade hub in the region. It is one of the clearest example of Swahili architecture—a fusion of South Asian, the Middle Eastern, and the East African styles—where ornately carved wooden doors are the gateways into multigenerational family homes made of local coral stone.",
17,Lake Turkana,Kenya,The world’s largest permanent desert lake is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-turkana,"Lake Turkana, Africa’s fourth largest and most saline lake, is a desolate wonder located in the arid desert region of the Kenyan Rift Valley, piercing the border of Ethiopia at its northernmost end. Also referred to as Lake Rudolf after European visitors named the lake after a 19th century Austrian prince, and Jade Lake for the verdant color of the water, Lake Turkana is a vast but shallow body of water that stretches over 150 miles long and up to 20 miles wide. The lake is an imperative resource for peoples in the surrounding desert region, migratory birds including flamingos, cormorants, and kingfishers, and local wildlife like the Nile Crocodile, hippos, and fish such as Nile perch, tigerfish, and tilapia. Lake Turkana and its islands were designated national parks in the 1970s and 80s. In 1997, Lake Turkana National Parks were collectively made a UNESCO World Heritage Site for the region’s extraordinary biodiversity. While UNESCO status requires the lake’s protection, Lake Turkana has since been placed on the World Heritage “In Danger” list for poor conservation practices and overdevelopment.","Visitors can reach Lake Turkana by car, boat, and public bus. The region is strictly accessible by 4-wheel drive vehicles only, and muddy roads make for difficult driving conditions during the rainy season. It’s recommended that visitors who choose to drive don’t venture solo in case of a breakdown in this remote area. The eastern side of Lake Turkana is slightly more populated, but supply stations are few and it’s suggested that travelers bring extra gas, drinking water, and camping supplies. Daily buses provide transportation between towns. Schedules are typically unreliable, but several bus companies offer routes within the region. Those who wish to cross the lake by boat must hire a private boat far in advance. Lake journeys are only possible in fair weather conditions. It is not advised to go swimming in Lake Turkana as the lake is home to saltwater crocodiles, including the Nile Crocodile."

Today, in the centre of Kenya’s capital city, the Nairobi Railway Museum is dedicated to the history of the country’s rail network. There you’ll find an intriguing jumble of artifacts plus a variety of exhibits and ephemera that illustrate the construction and running of the railway. There are models of railway engines that operated on the line, photographs of the railway throughout its history, and a varied selection of other oddities, including an interesting motorized railway bicycle. In the surrounding yard are a number of mostly steam and some early diesel locomotives which operated as part of what was initially the Kenya-Uganda Railway, then the East Africa Railway Company and currently the Kenyan Railways Corporation. The most impressive are some of the company’s old “Garratts,” a particularly large articulated steam engine that was capable of hauling heavy loads over the long distances and steep inclines of the narrow gauge track. The museum is connected by track to the main Nairobi station and some of the engines are reportedly used for excursions. Wandering on and around the locomotives makes for a lovely outing and gives you a surprising amount of insight into the nation’s development. The museum itself is almost a time capsule within a time capsule—a well preserved effort from the post-independence days of the 1970s to conserve an emblematic part of its colonial past. Fitting then is the location of the museum, tucked away amid the modern skyscrapers of the central business district. The rising buildings are a constant reminder that all these days are past, a fact further underlined by the ongoing replacement of the obsolete track laid in the 1800s.",The museum is located in the centre of Nairobi near the railway station and is open daily from 9am-5pm. For those visiting and not well acquainted with Nairobi it would be advisable to take a taxicab to the museum and ask the driver to wait or call them when you are finished. The entrance fee for non-Kenyan residents is currently 600 Kenyan Shillings.
19,Karen Blixen Museum,"Nairobi, Kenya","The farmhouse owned by the Danish author who wrote ""Out of Africa"" is now a museum honoring her legacy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karen-blixen-museum,"Some 6 miles outside the center of Nairobi, the Karen Blixen Museum is located in a century-old farmhouse on 6,000 acres of land at the foot of Kenya’s Ngong Hills. The farm was once owned by the Swedish Baron Bror von Blixen Fincke and his wife, Baroness Karen Blixen, who gained significant prominence for her 1937 memoir, “Out of Africa.” The couple bought the property in 1917 and lived in the farmhouse until 1921, when Karen Blixen became the sole owner of the home following the end of her marriage. Blixen fell in love with an English game hunter named Denys Finch Hatton, who died in a plane crash in 1931. The tragedy prompted Blixen to return to Denmark that same year, and the farmhouse passed through several successive owners. In 1964, the Danish government purchased Blixen’s former farmhouse house and gifted it to Kenya as a token of the country’s newly gained independence from Britain. The house appeared in the film adaptation of Out of Africa in 1985, after which the National Museums of Kenya acquired the property to convert the house into a museum. The Karen Blixen Museum opened in 1986 in honor of Blixen’s life and work at her beloved residence “in Africa at the foot of the Ngong Hills,” as she so famously wrote.",The Karen Blixen Museum is open seven days a week from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Visitors are suggested to arrive no later than 5:30 p.m. Guided tours are offered daily.
20,African Heritage House,"Mlolongo, Kenya","This beautiful, all-in-one museum, private residence, and bed and breakfast houses a rich collection of African art.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/african-heritage-house,"Overlooking Nairobi National Park, the African Heritage House is an architectural gem dedicated to African art. The house was designed in the early 1990s by Alan Donovan, an American who first arrived in the continent as a relief worker in the 1960s. In 1972, he opened the African Heritage Gallery with Joseph Murumbi, a former Kenyan vice president and avid collector, and Murumbi’s wife, a prequel to the current museum. The African Heritage House is the fruit of one Donovan’s love of Africa and his desire to preserve and share artifacts he has gathered from all over the continent. Inside the house, whose exterior is inspired by the mosques of Mali, visitors can go room to room, observing furniture, textiles, masks, art, jewelry, artifacts, crafts, books, and photographs. As the African Heritage House is also Donovan’s home, he serves as a gracious guide and host, sharing both his life story and his knowledge of the collection, which includes ceremonial daggers from Benin, a Yoruba wooden headdress, giant calabashes, camel blankets, and much more. If you wish, the African Heritage House can be your home for a night as well: It is a bed and breakfast, with different rooms following the styles and motifs of different parts of Africa, and the kitchen menu featuring an equal variety of dishes and cuisines.","If you'd like to stay overnight, you can book directly through the museum’s website or through various hotel-booking websites. All tours, meals, and overnight stays must be booked in advance."

The Kuona Trust Arts Centre celebrates creativity and community by elevating artists across disciplines and engaging locals through educational programs and exhibitions. A spot at the Kuona Trust Arts Centre is open to artists who appreciate culture and creativity. As artists-in-residence, artists work on a new body of work to be exhibited upon the residency’s close. Each artist also donates one artwork to the Centre’s private collection. The Centre is one of Nairobi’s most progressive spaces, dedicated to supporting the production and appreciation of contemporary art in the city, which is rapidly developing an independent art scene. Since 2008, the Trust has maintained the Centre and worked to expand artistic interest across Kenya. Ten studio spaces, training programs, and workshops in sculpture, printmaking, blacksmithing, and woodworking help creatives around the community cultivate new skills and experiment with various media. A proponent of cultural exchange and open-mindedness, the Kuona Trust Arts Centre is open to international artists and holds exhibitions, artists’ talks, and public events for curious visitors and residents alike.",The Kuona Trust Artists Centre is open daily from 9 am to 8 pm.
22,Nairobi City Park,"Nairobi, Kenya",This urban park is home to monkeys and a number of endangered plants.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nairobi-city-park,"Tucked away in the bustling streets of Nairobi is a nice, serene, public park. At first glance, it may not look that different from most urban parks in the world but you’ll soon come across its unique inhabitants—hundreds of Sykes’ monkeys that call this place home. The park is maintained by a group of volunteers called Friends of City Park and there are several donation boxes located throughout the area. In addition, the park is located very close to a local street market where you can purchase nuts, corn, seeds, and fruits for the monkeys to enjoy. The City Park Botanic Gardens inside the park are a safe haven for endemic plant species that are threatened in their natural habitats. Of the nearly 600 plant species in the park, there are some 110 that are considered high conservation priority, 16 of which are endemic species. Seven occur in the wild only in Kenya, and nine are regional endemics, found only in East Africa. These endangered plants include Aloe ballyi, a tall-growing succulent known as “Tree Aloe,” and Borassus aethiopum, a large palm that grows to around 25 meters (82 feet) in height. A plant nursery in the park nurtures saplings that are distributed in the Nairobi area as well as farther afield. Near the center of the park you can find the Murumbi Peace Memorial Garden. Opened in March 2009, this memorial honors Joseph Murumbi, a Kenyan politician who served as the country’s second Vice President.",
23,David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust,"Nairobi, Kenya",This wildlife trust is dedicated to orphaned elephant rescue and conservation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/david-sheldrick-wildlife-trust,"There aren’t many animals as iconic, characteristic, and memorable as elephants. Such large and powerful creatures, yet gentle and tranquil. Being able to witness an elephant in person is always a remarkable experience. Most people will probably only see them in places like zoos, but there is a place in the world where one can not only visit the home of elephants but help care for them as well. Founded by Daphne Sheldrick in 1977 in honor of her late husband conservationist David Sheldrick, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has dedicated itself to rescuing and raising orphaned elephants for over 40 years. Elephants along with rhinos are brought in from across Kenya and other areas of east Africa where they are placed in the care of expert and compassionate handlers. The wildlife trust is open to the public where many tour groups often visit and the proceeds are used to care for these majestic animals. People can even foster and adopt a specific elephant or rhino, and have the opportunity to meet their animal face to face. Although it may not seem like much, every purchase and donation is crucial to the animal’s well-being and even small contributions are vital to their care. If you are passionate about animals, would like to help with their care, and make a meaningful impact, the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is a great place to visit.",
24,Iten: Home of Champions,"Iten, Kenya",The Kenyan town where the best distance runners in the world are trained.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iten-home-of-champions,"In some ways, Iten, Kenya, looks like a typical African town. Families live in squat stone houses scattered around the mountainous countryside, tend their land, and lead farm animals through the town’s red-dirt roads. Once a week there is a market in the center of town, where one can find both handmade goods and knockoffs of Western brands at a steep discount. Children as young as five wander freely, always happy to initiate conversation with strangers. But Iten is unlike any other town in the world: It is the undisputed capital of Kenyan distance running, a discipline that the country dominates internationally. Kenyan runners won 19 Boston Marathon titles in a 22-year stretch and have posted 10 of the top 11 fastest times ever in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, to give two examples of their unprecedented success at the global level. The majority of Kenyan runners are part of the Kalenjin tribe, which forms the ethnic majority in Western Kenya near the Rift Valley, which Iten is at the heart of. The village is at the perfect altitude for long-distance training and has miles of hilly dirt roads. This, along with the relative political stability of the area, has attracted elite athletes from all over the country and the world to come train with the champions. Visiting Iten is on the bucket list for many distance runners. Waking up before the crack of dawn to run, you’ll witness groups of Kenyans dressed in track jackets and tights wordlessly embarking on their first of as many as three daily runs, a training load that can easily reach 20 to 30 miles per day. Later in the day, you can visit Kamariny Stadium, a dirt track located next to the local primary school, to watch athletes complete intervals at a dizzying clip. Here, it is fairly easy to pick out the Olympic medalists and championship marathoners who work out alongside their more anonymous countrymen. Choosing to pursue the running dream is a grueling and thankless task for Iten athletes, who face long odds of making it big. In a region where there are few career options besides farming, many elect to train full time in hopes of catching the attention of foreign agents, who can fly them to prestigious races on the European circuit with lucrative cash prizes. It is not uncommon to meet an athlete whose personal best in the marathon would place him in the top 50 or faster in the United States, yet is so poor he has not purchased new running shoes in 10 years. The runners initially trained on the track of St. Patrick’s High School. In 1999, former world champion Lornah Kiplagat opened a facility for both locals and foreigners called the High Altitude Training Center, with well-furnished rooms, a communal dining room, and modern training equipment.","The nearest airport is located in Eldoret, which is a 45 minute flight from Nairobi. From there, Iten can be reached by taxi."
25,George Adamson's Grave,"Tana River County, Kenya","Final resting place of one of Africa's most famous conservationists, murdered by bandits.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/george-adamson-s-grave,"Played by Richard Harris in the film “To Walk With Lions” and portrayed with his one-time wife, Joy Adamson, in “Born Free,” George Adamson was the author of several books, a well-known safari hunter, senior game warden in Kenya, and one of history’s most famous conservationists. Adamson spent the last years of his life living in a remote outpost in Kenya, where he worked hands-on with dozens of lions, helping to reintegrate them into the wild after being released from zoos and circuses. Even though he was once attacked by one of his male lions, Adamson was never deterred to continue his dangerous work. ”Like people, they can look impressive, beautiful, curious, ugly or plain,” Adamson once said. “The best are adventurous, loyal and brave. All of them have been designed and perfected by nature to kill.” His work was supported by the Royal Geographic Society and the National Museums of Kenya, but Adamson always had critics who contested his methods for big cat rehabilitation and his nature, his way of aggressively dealing with authorities. Adamson was shot and killed by bandits or poachers on August 20, 1989, while attempting to help a tourist escape. Adamson’s body was cremated and buried in Kora National Park, a place where he spent his last decades and stubbornly refused to leave even when the violence continued to escalate. He rests next to his brother, Terence, who died two years earlier at the park, and two of his lions.",
26,Ol Pejeta Rhino Cemetery,"Nanyuki, Kenya",The memorial honors the lives of rhinoceroses killed by poachers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ol-pejeta-rhino-cemetery,"The Rhino Cemetery of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Nanyuki, Kenya, might be one of the loveliest and saddest places on Earth. Sixteen gravestones in two neat rows lay beneath a solitary acacia tree on the windswept savannah of the Ol Pejeta wildlife sanctuary. Each grave represents a rhinoceros killed by poachers on Conservancy property since its founding in 2004. The grave markers are stone cairns, and the front of each cairn holds a bronze plaque that bears the Rhino’s name, gender and species, dates, and the circumstances of their death. The Rhino Cemetery was established in 2014 and fittingly opened on September 22: World Rhino Day. The illegal trafficking of rhinoceros horn, incorrectly believed to have value as a medicine and aphrodisiac, threatens the animals’ survival worldwide. The grave markers illustrate the horrors of poaching. For example, a 20-year-old female black rhino, Ishirini, was found on February 22, 2016, bleeding and writhing in pain from being shot with poisoned arrows. Both her horns had been cut off her still living body. She was 12 months pregnant at the time of her death. Max, a six-year-old male black rhino, was killed despite being dehorned as protection from poaching. The poachers removed his small, regrowing horn nubs. There are similar stories for each of the murdered rhinos. Additionally, the Cemetery contains the graves of four rhinoceros whose lives and histories were significant to Ol Pejeta and who became ambassadors for their species. Especially poignant is the grave of Sudan, the last known male Northern white rhinoceros. In December 2009, Sudan was moved from the Dvůr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy for a “Last Chance to Survive” breeding program. Accompanying him were Suni, another male, as well as Sudan’s daughter, Najin, and his granddaughter, Fatu. The four rhinos were the last known members of their subspecies which had been decimated by poaching, habitat loss, and civil war.  Unfortunately, attempts to breed the rhinos in Kenya were unsuccessful. Preceded in death by Suni, Sudan succumbed to the infirmities of old age on March 19, 2018, and his death made worldwide headlines. He was 45. At the time of Sudan’s death, the Northern white rhino subspecies became functionally extinct. Mother and daughter, Najin and Fatu, are the last known surviving Northern white rhinos, and can no longer bear offspring. However, some hope for their subspecies remains. Using IVF procedures, scientists successfully created embryos from fresh eggs collected from Najin and Fatu and frozen sperm from deceased males. They hope to successfully implant the embryos in Southern white rhinos who will carry them as surrogate mothers. The last remaining Northern white rhinos can be visited in their compound at Ol Pejeta, where their keepers and armed guards protect them day and night. Ol Pejeta Conservancy was founded in 2004 as a not-for-profit wildlife sanctuary. The property is situated on the Equator in central Kenya and encompasses 140 square miles. Originally established as a sanctuary for the endangered Black Rhino, the Conservancy is home to Africa’s “Big Five,” as well as dozens of common and endangered animal and bird species. In 2014, Ol Pejeta was designated a “Key 1” sanctuary for black rhinos upon the birth of its 100th calf. The Conservancy is also home to the Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary, founded in partnership with the Jane Goodall Institute and established as a lifetime refuge for orphaned and abused chimpanzees.","If you're coming from Nairobi, the drive is about 3 to 4 hours. Entry fees can be paid online. Activities and campsites can be booked online, too. Ol Pejeta Conservancy can be visited during any season but for visitors who are driving themselves, a 4x4 is necessary during the rainy season."
27,Ha Kome Cave Dwellings,Lesotho,An 18th-century hideout became a permanent and ongoing residence for one Lesotho tribe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ha-kome-cave-dwellings,"The cliff overhangs of Ha Kome are a series of cave dwellings an hour’s drive from Maseru, the capital of Lesotho. While their exact history is unknown, the current inhabitants are descended from Basia tribesmen and women who first made the overhang home in the late 1800s. The Mefcane (“the Crushing”) was a period of intense socio-political unrest during the 1820s and 30s throughout southern Africa, defined by widespread drought, forced migration, and inter-tribal warfare. To flee the ongoing violence, the Basia began using the overhang as a hideout at some point in the late 1800s, though trademark cave paintings indicate San Bushmen dwelt here even earlier. In time, the Basia came to build homes out of mud, which have been continuously occupied since then. Today, several families who live in these dwellings welcome visitors into their homes.","Ha Kome is easy enough to find using Google Maps, but you'll need a vehicle with a high clearance to make it down the dirt road.  Stop in at the Visitor's Center, and a friendly guide will hop in to show you the way."

Ellenberger created the small residence in 1867 after he and his family were forced further South by the Basotho-Boar War. Ellenberger found a well-known cave in the rocky mountains of Lesotho and decided it was the perfect spot to found his new church, and bring God to the people of the country. The missionary built a brick edifice on to the opening of the cave and spent 55 years ministering to the peoples of the area. The cave had previously been used as a shelter for the local tribes, but soon became a beacon of Christianity. In addition to its half-natural construction the cave house also had a handful of other features. There is a dinosaur track in the ceiling and it is said that Ellenberger’s son is entombed in the wall. The home is now a small museum holding an eclectic group of objects, including family photos, traditional clothing, taxidermied animals, and of course a dinosaur footprint in the ceiling.","The Cave House is about 5 kilometers west of Quthing. You have to turn onto the road for the Masitise Primary School. Before you reach the school, follow the road to the right. You'll reach a small cluster of buildings and someone there can open the Cave House for you."

Lesotho’s amazing Ha Baroana site is only an hour’s drive from the capital of Maseru, and on the far side of the Liphiring River, tucked inconspicuously beneath a black-and-tan cave, sit a remarkably preserved stretch of paintings. The walls of Ha Baroana, which translates as “home of the bushmen,” are decorated with paintings of animals like leopards, lions, antelope, cranes, and guinea fowls, as well as paintings of people hunting and dancing. It has been estimated that the paintings were made about 2,000 years ago by the San people, a group of hunter-gatherers who have inhabited southern Africa for thousands of years, long before the arrival of Bantu-speaking nations. Though the paintings are faded from years of exposure to the elements, it’s still possible to make out a series of hunting scenes, a sight that is sure to give even the most jaded wanderer chills.","It's best to take a local guide with a 4x4, as the last several kilometers of the trip call for crossing a series of working pastures.  Although the steep, scenic hike down into the river valley will be almost as impressive as the paintings themselves, the path isn't suitable for anyone for mobility issues, and can be downright treacherous during the rainy summer season."

31,Subeng River Dinosaur Prints,"Jonathans, Lesotho",Take a step into the Cretaceous Period with these preserved dinosaur tracks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/subeng-river-dinosaur-prints,"Just over two hours from the city of Maseru, the narrow Subeng River in northern Lesotho has been home to a series of fossilized dinosaur prints for hundreds of millions of years. The reward for wading across the shallow water is a chance to get up close and personal with the tracks of several types of dinos, including the unique three-toed prints of the chicken-sized Lesothosaurus. The fossilized footprints were first identified as dinosaur tracks in 1955. Footprints from at least three species of dinosaurs, possibly more, can be found at this site. In the preserved tracks, you can see that some had five toes on their feet, while others had three. By placing their hands down on the rocks, a visitor can instantly bridge the gap between the Cretaceous and the present.","The Subeng River rises quickly during the rainy summer months, obscuring several varieties of prints altogether.  If possible, it's best to plan your visit during the dry wintertime.  Bring a pair of boots if you have them, or a towel if you plan on going barefoot."

The hat has a wide brim and a pointed top, a design that is said to be inspired by the shape of Mount Qiloane. A similar style of hat was worn by Basotho tribal chiefs, who performed a type of song known as mokorotlo at certain ceremonies. In the 1950s and 60s, the hats became popular among the wider population, and were called mokorotlo because of their connection to Basotho identity. It became such an important symbol that when Lesotho gained independence from Great Britain in 1966, it was selected to appear on the country’s new flag. Basotho Hat is a two-story arts and crafts collective that hosts a wide assortment of baskets and weavings, all of which were manufactured throughout the Mountain Kingdom. It’s a great way to support local businesses in a place where the average salary is less than $2 USD per day.","Located just a few kilometers after you cross into the kingdom from South Africa via the busy Maseru Bridge, the Basotho Hat makes a natural first stop for day-trippers and adventure travelers alike.

Due to looting and locals taking up residence in the hotel through the years, the hotel is dilapidated and dangers exist throughout. However, able-bodied individuals should be able to navigate the stairways without too much trouble, and the sight from the rooftop - giving a full panoramic view of Monrovia - easily merits the effort.

35,Bomi Blue Lake,"Tubmanburg, Liberia","An abandoned mine pit is now a beautiful, colorful attraction.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bomi-blue-lake,"When the Liberia Mining Company began to abandon its operations in Bomi County in northwestern Liberia, it left behind a series of pit mines. But as nature began to reclaim these scars in the Bomi Hills, one of the pits filled with water, creating a beautiful blue lake. Back in the 1960s and ‘70s, the LMC began operations in the Bomi Hills near the town of Tubmanburg. The company dug a series of huge pits to extract iron ore from the hills, but by the late 1970s, the ore reserves were deemed depleted and the company closed its operations. The LMC left a landscape pockmarked by pits, so much so that locals began to wryly refer to the Bomi Hills as the Bomi Holes. And the mining company had left so quickly that they even abandoned some of their equipment at the bottom of the craters. It was a mess, but one that nature slowly began to reclaim. And as it did so, one of the largest pits took on a whole new life of its own. Despite being stuck up in the hills and isolated from any obvious sources of water, the 300-foot-deep pit began to fill with water, likely fed by a spring somewhere down below. By the end of the 1990s, the lake looked like a totally natural formation. And in 2007, Senator Richard Devine, in whose constituency the lake was situated, began to promote the wonders of what he billed as “a natural phenomenon and …. a wonderful sight to behold.” “One thing is certain about this lake,” continued the Senator, “Whether rain or shine, it never rises above its banks, nor does it dry. The water level is absolutely stable. It’s a wonderful sight, a haven for hotel and casino development, and of course water sports.” Senator Devine’s enthusiasm certainly helped draw attention to the Blue Lake, named for its clear blue waters. But so far, hotels and casinos have yet to set up around the lake. There are a few weathered wooden pavilions, but little else. Still, it’s certainly a pretty spot for a picnic. Despite the lake’s mining history— and the possible presence of mining equipment at its bottom—it was, for a while, the source of bottled Blue Lake mineral water. And it seems that the waters are clean and free from pollution. But before you go for a swim, as many do, you might want to know about certain sightings by  United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) soldiers stationed in the area. These soldiers have apparently spotted some big snakes in the lake, and locals sometimes speak of a particularly large boa living near the waters of the Blue Lake.","Blue Lake, also known as Bomi Lake, is located in the Bomi Hills, about three miles north of the town of Tubmanburg. If you’re feeling fit you could hike up to the lake from Tubmanburg. Otherwise, find someone in town to take you up there in a 4x4 vehicle."
36,Monkey Island,"Marshall, Liberia","After surviving decades of medical testing and civil wars, these chimpanzees were abandoned on their own islands.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monkey-island-liberia,"The year was 1974 and the original Planet of the Apes movie starring Charlton Heston had just been adapted into a small screen series. Little did anyone know, though, that out in the remote jungles of Liberia, a New York non-profit and idealistic young scientist were setting in motion what 30 years later would become what many now call the “real-life planet of the apes.” That non-profit was the New York Blood Center, one of the largest blood banks in the United States. In search of a vaccine for a spate of blood-related diseases, NYBC bankrolled Vilab II, a controversial laboratory led by Betsy Brotman that would go on to conduct medical tests on over 100 chimpanzees. The chimps were injected with various forms of Hepatitis, onchocerciasis (commonly referred to as river blindness), and a host of other maladies. Once they tested positive for one of the diseases, the animals would be transferred to one of six different islands—that, thanks to chimpanzees’ innate physiological inability to swim—were perfect for keeping the infected subjects away from the regular population. Vilab continued its work as Liberia crumbled into civil war, first in 1989 and again in 1999. Eventually, though, the lab encountered a conflict that it could not overcome: growing resistance to animal testing back in the U.S. Eventually, the anti-testing outcry reached the highest levels of the U.S. federal government and the National Institute of Health instituted a moratorium on breeding research chimps and declared that most chimp testing did more harm than good. In 2005, Vilab was shut down for good and all the chimps, approximately 60 or so, were transferred to a series of nearby uninhabited mangrove islands, where they now permanently live. For the next 10 years, NYBC continued to care for the chimps, hiring many of the original lab staff to take food and water to the islands every other day. Then, in March 2015, NYBC suddenly withdrew its financial support, stating they could no longer provide for their former subjects’ well-being. Thankfully, the Humane Society stepped up and decided to assume the responsibility of providing long-term care for the chimps, which costs upwards of $30,000 a month. While her methods eventually fell out of favor, Betsy Brotman and her team’s research did successfully lead to a vaccine for Hepatitis B and a screening method for Hepatitis C. In a 2014 interview, however, Betsy publicly sided with the animal rights activists that eventually caused her lab to close, stating that she no longer believed chimpanzees should be used in experiments.","Do not attempt to visit Monkey Island on your own. The chimps are extremely territorial and are not afraid of making their presence known. If you're intent on visiting, local fishermen can be hired to arrange a boat ride to the island for a negotiated fee."
37,Libassa Ecolodge,"Marshall, Liberia","This Liberian resort offers comfort, ecofriendly hospitality, and a mission of sustainability.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/libassa-ecolodge,"No palm trees were harmed in the making of Libassa Ecolodge, a sustainable resort nestled amid a palm-forested lagoon in Liberia. Built on a foundation of conservationist principles, Libassa Ecolodge endeavors to strike a chord of harmony between visitors and the environment through sustainable practices, education, and mindfulness. A fleet of solar-powered huts comprise the on-site accommodations, which range from the most basic Palaver Hut, a traditional Liberian abode housing a double bed and balcony and constructed with local materials, to the Mangrove Lodge, which hovers over the lagoon with a queen-sized bed, a private pool, and balcony. Regardless of how luxurious your lodgings are, each hut is limited to 200 watts of electricity per room, used only in limited amounts via certified low-energy bulbs and appliances. Water use in each hut is restricted, food is composted, and all paper and plastic products must be recycled. For every tree used to build the huts, at least one new seedling was planted in its stead; and none of the surrounding palm trees were cut down to make way for the resort. On-site recreational activities are equally low-impact and include a small mini golf course, badminton and beach volleyball courts, a ping pong table, diving, snorkeling, bodyboarding, canoeing, horseback riding, and archery. To cultivate awareness of local cultures and the ecosystem, Libassa Ecolodge also offers a restaurant that serves up West African cuisine, the opportunity to partake in African and Latin dance lessons, a tranquil wander through a manicured botanical garden, and an animal sanctuary. The lodge aims to become 100 percent renewable through solar and wind power.",Accommodations can be reserved on Libassa Ecolodge’s website. Visitors should be aware that the road past Kpan's Town near the resort is only drivable by all-terrain vehicle.
38,Liberian National Museum,"Monrovia, Liberia",A comprehensive museum dedicated to Africa's oldest modern republic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/liberian-national-museum,"With two devastating civil wars casting a shadow over its modern image, it’s often forgotten that Liberia was the first African republic to proclaim its independence—a feat it accomplished back in 1847. Even more impressive is the fact that this tiny nation, founded by an upstart group that encouraged free African Americans to migrate to Africa, was able to maintain its sovereignty in the face of intense European colonization, which by the time it was over, left nearly 90 percent of the continent’s total landmass in the hands of foreign powers. These are points of pride for Liberians today—and they are on full display at the Liberian National Museum. The institution is housed in an old executive mansion in downtown Monrovia that was damaged and looted during both civil wars but has been subsequently upgraded and repaired with the assistance of UNESCO. While much of the museum’s collection was carried off by rebels and locals exploiting the chaos of the Second Liberian Civil War, several key artifacts remain, including a 250-year-old dining table that Queen Victoria gave to Joseph Jenkins Roberts, Liberia’s first president. Today, the museum’s ground floor has an impressive collection of musical instruments, masks, and other crafts that provide a strong introduction to the country’s indigenous tribes and traditions, while the second and third floors chronicle the country’s founding, challenges, and successes, including the recent Ebola epidemic.","The museum is open from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. daily except for Sunday, when it is typically closed. Guided tours are available."
39,Robertsport Ghost Ship,"Robertsport, Liberia","After several weeks of radio silence, this abandoned oil tanker washed up on a remote beach in Liberia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/robertsport-ghost-ship,"In 2016, this mysterious ship bearing the name Tamaya 1 washed up on the shores of Robertsport, Liberia. After the 60-meter-long ship washed ashore, it took government officials several days to realize what had happened, as the Liberian coast is largely unmonitored. Two days later, the government officials learned about the mystery ship on their shores, the Coast Guard boarded the vessel to investigate. The lifeboats were missing and there was no trace of the crew. The Ministry of National Defense put out a statement saying that the bridge was “gutted by fire” and all documents onboard the ship had been burned to a crisp. Theories began to circulate about the cause. The Tamaya was an oil tanker bound for Dakar, Senegal, that had last been seen some three weeks before it washed up on the Robertsport beach. Some suspected the crew and ship had been victims of piracy. That theory was dismissed, as the vessel’s last known position was outside of the waters where pirate groups typically operate. Several months after the incident, the alleged owner, Nigerian national Robert M. Saigba, came to Liberia to meet with government officials. Saigba claimed that the crew was forced to abandon ship to a fishing vessel, leaving behind the Tamaya and their lifeboat. The lifeboat was later found washed up in Edina, Liberia, about 125 miles away.","The ship is a short coastal hike south from Nana's Lodge. Following the coast will get you to the ship, but you will have to either walk across some slippery rocks on the coast or go around them through the forest. The hike is not too difficult but you should take care to wear proper shoes that have grip, not beach sandals."
40,Paynesville Omega Tower,"Paynesville, Liberia",The dead gigantic radio tower of Liberia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paynesville-omega-tower,"For the implementation of the VLF or Very Low Frequency-Navigation System “OMEGA” in 1976, the US Coast Guard erected a 417 meter tall radio tower, which is taller than any man-made object existing today in the European Union! Built near Paynesville in Liberia, it served together with seven other stations as part of a worldwide navigation system, and which could be used to communicate with submerged submarines. While VLF has a very low data transmission rate, one of the advantages of VLF is that, unlike higher frequencies, of say VHF or UHF, it can deeply penetrate seawater to reach submarines. (Frequencies such as VLF and ELF, extremely low frequency, have been cited as the casue behind disoriented and injured whales who communicate using the same wavelengths) However by the 1990s, the global satellite system and GPS made OMEGA obsolete and so OMEGA was shut-off on September 30th, 1997 and the station was given back to the government of Liberia. Unfortunately during this period the government of Liberia was involved in a bloody civil war and had no use for the transmitter and the huge mast, which though it survived the civil war until today, continues to go unused. As there is no access restriction to the mast, it is theoretically possible it could be used for skydiving, powerful transmission experiments and Tesla experiments. For those Tesla experiments however, one ought not forget, that Liberia is a country with a very unreliable electric power supply, so one should come with their own, very large, power generator. Update: The Paynesville tower was demolished in 2011.",
