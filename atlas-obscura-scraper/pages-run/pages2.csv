0,Nyiragongo Volcano,Democratic Republic of the Congo,Mount Nyiragongo has erupted at least 34 times since 1882 & is home to the world's largest lava lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lava-lake-nyiragongo-volcano,"You’d think that the last place on Earth people would want to inhabit would be the bottom of a steep volcano hosting the world’s largest fluid lava lake. Despite the constant threat of catastrophic fiery death, the area at the foot of Mount Nyiragongo is dotted with highly populated bustling villages. One such disaster occurred in 1977, when the walls of the crater burst open and the lake of molten rock drained in less than an hour, pouring itself down into the villages at a terrifying speed of up to 60 mph. Unlike your average lava flow, the unique presence of an alkali-rich volcanic rock, melilite nephelinite, creates a highly fluid consistency, allowing it to move at speeds that can easily overcome anything in its path. The official death toll was 70, but many report much higher numbers, some estimating the losses at several thousand. The 1977 eruption took place when the lake was at its maximum depth ever recorded, 10,700 ft., but the extent of its volume varies depending on activity. No one knows how long the volcano has been active, but since 1882 it’s been very busy, erupting at least 34 times, occasionally bubbling and spewing fire for years before settling down. Located inside Virunga National Park about 20 km. North of Goma, Mount Nyiragongo is currently still active, its last deadly eruption taking 147 lives in 2002. Its activity is, for now, being confined to the crater, where the lake of lava is slowly rising once more.",
1,Senkwekwe Mountain Gorilla Center,Democratic Republic of the Congo,The world's only facility where orphaned mountain gorillas are cared for.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/senkwekwe-mountain-gorilla-centre,"Established in 2009, the Senkwekwe Mountain Gorilla Center in Virunga National Park is the world’s only facility specifically created to care for orphaned mountain gorillas. While concerted conservation efforts over the last 30 years have brought the population of wild mountain gorillas from a dangerous low of 620 to just over 1,000 today, these beautiful creatures still face extreme threats in their natural habitat straddling the dangerous and unstable border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi. That’s where Virunga National Park’s Senkwekwe Mountain Gorilla Center comes in. As part of Africa’s oldest national park, the Senkwekwe Center was established in 2009 to care for orphaned mountain gorillas who were victims of wildlife poachers or animal trackers as infants. The Senkwekwe Center, which is named after a family of six mountain gorillas that were brutally murdered in 2007, is a unique sanctuary for these incredibly endangered species to live a full, protected life. The Center is managed by Virunga Park rangers and other dedicated staff, who are currently caring for four orphaned gorillas that were injured in snares or lost their family members. It has the rare distinction of being the only place in the world where mountain gorillas have been documented to thrive in captivity.","After a series of attacks and kidnappings that led to the deaths of at least 12 park rangers in 2018, Virunga National Park is currently closed to visitors and is not expected to reopen until at least 2019. If you plan on visiting when the park reopens, please contact an experienced and reputable tour company that can ensure your visit is conducted in as safe and reliable a way as possible."
2,Okapi Wildlife Reserve,"Ituri, Democratic Republic of the Congo","Home to pygmy hunter-gatherers, hundreds of animal and bird species, and the strange okapi, or forest giraffe.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/okapi-wildlife-reserve,"Located in the Congo River basin, the Okapi Wildlife Reserve is a refuge for nomadic pygmy Mbuti and Efe hunters and many species of animals and birds. It’s also home to about 5,000 of the estimated 30,000 okapi surviving in the wild. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve was established in 1992 and listed as a World Heritage Site in 1996. Covering about 5,300 square miles of the Ituri forest in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the reserve helps to protect rare plant and animal life, as well as the traditional lifestyle and culture of nomadic pygmy hunter-gatherers. The reserve takes its name from the okapi that live in its forests. These strange creatures are notable for the zebra-like markings on their legs, but are most closely related to giraffes, hence their other common names: forest giraffe, Congolese giraffe or zebra giraffe. Some 30,000 okapis survive in the wild today, of which about 5,000 live in the reserve. In total, the reserve is home to 101 mammal species and 376 documented species of birds. These include 17 species of primates (with a population of around 7,500 chimpanzees), an estimated 7,500 forest elephants, and populations of dwarf antelopes, water chevrotains, forest buffalo, bongos (nocturnal forest antelopes) and giant forest hogs. Along with the rangers who protect the park, the other guardians of these forests are the Mbuti and Efe hunters who roam the reserve. Both are pygmy peoples, with adult males typically reaching a height of at most 4 feet and 11 inches. They have lived in these forests for centuries, perhaps millennia, and continue to live as hunter-gatherers deep in the forest, maintaining their traditional lifestyles in harmony with their environment. Other humans, however, are far less respectful of the reserve and its many natural resources. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve faces numerous threats, including the commercial hunting of bushmeat, slash-and-burn forest clearance for agriculture, and illegal mining and logging, all exacerbated as immigrants continue to move into the Ituri forest from the overpopulated highlands to the east. As if that wasn’t problematic enough, armed militias are also a threat to the reserve, its rangers, and all that live within it. Like Virunga National Park in the DRC, Okapi has suffered attacks by Mai-Mai rebels. In June 2012, a group formed of elephant poachers and illegal miners attacked the Epulu Conservation and Research Center, killing six people and 13 of the 14 okapis that lived at the center. In July 2017, a large group of journalists and park rangers were attacked by a group also thought to have been Mai Mai rebels. The foreign journalists escaped with several rangers, but four local wardens and a tracker were killed. As with Virunga National Park, the situation remains tense and efforts are ongoing to maintain the relative stability of the reserve in the face of these man-made threats.","The Okapi Wildlife Reserve is located in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from the borders with South Sudan and Uganda. The nearest city to the reserve is Isiro, but tourists can arrange tours leaving from Beni or Kisangani, both of which require at least a full day journey, and longer in the wet season. But before you even consider a visit to the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, contact the Okapi Conservation Project for an update on the current security situation. On December 4, 2018, the Okapi Conservation Project told Atlas Obscura the following: “Technically, the Reserve is open for tourists, but we strongly encourage people not to travel to the area, especially with the pending presidential election on December 23. Security is unpredictable and they just closed the nearest airport in Bunia after stating security issues. After the election, we do not know what the situation will be. There is no fee to enter the Reserve for tourists at this time, but they would need to contact us to arrange a stay for a nominal fee, as we have the only place to stay in the town of Epulu, the Headquarters of the Reserve. Pending the results of the election, safety, and security, we hope to bring tourism back to the Reserve in the next few years.”"
3,Virunga National Park,Democratic Republic of the Congo,The most biologically diverse protected area in Africa is also the most dangerous.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/virunga-national-park,"Virunga National Park is the oldest and most biologically diverse protected area in Africa. Covering about 3,000 square miles, it’s a vital refuge for endangered gorillas and hundreds of other rare species. But it is also one of the world’s most dangerous conservation projects, as armed conflict has led to the death of more than 180 park rangers in the last 20 years. Created in 1925, Virunga National Park covers a vast area in the heart of the Albertine Rift Valley in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With its river valleys, volcanoes, lakes, and tropical forests, the park has an almost unrivaled diversity of ecosystems and landscapes. These habitats provide a home to many rare and endangered species, most famously the critically endangered mountain gorillas who live in Virunga’s volcanic forests, accounting for about one-third of the global population. More than 200 other mammal species live in the park, including okapis, lions, hippos, and forest and savanna elephants, alongside 706 species of birds, 109 recorded reptile species, 78 amphibian species, and 22 species of primates. Add humans into the mix, however, and things take a darker turn. Armed conflict has plagued the region for decades, and clashes with militia and smugglers have resulted in the deaths of more than 180 park rangers in Virunga over the last 20 years. Today, some 600 brave rangers risk their lives every day to protect the park, the gorillas, and all the other species that call Virunga home. And while they continue to do their job, the park itself has been closed to tourists since June 2018. The closure was enforced after rebels killed one park ranger and abducted two British tourists. The tourists were later released, but the park was closed until the end of the year. Whether Virunga will reopen in 2019 remains to be seen. The park is looking to introduce more robust security measures to help combat multiple security threats, including smuggling, illegal charcoal production, poaching, and the continued presence of the Mai Mai militia.","Virunga National Park is currently closed to visitors. The Virunga National Park Tourism official website has no details about the future reopening of the park, but does have a contact email for tourist inquiries. Prior to its closure, park permits ranged from $200 to $400."
4,Kahuzi-Biéga National Park,Democratic Republic of the Congo,One of the last refuges of the endangered eastern lowland gorilla.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kahuzibiega-national-park,"Covering 2,300 square miles, Kahuzi-Biéga National Park is one of the largest national parks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is also one of the last refuges of the eastern lowland gorilla, now considered critically endangered. Kahuzi-Biéga National Park was established in 1970 by Adrien Deschryver, a Belgian photographer and conservationist who ranks alongside Dian Fossey as one of the great protectors of the world’s endangered gorilla population. The vast park is named after the two dormant volcanoes located within its limits, Mount Kahuzi and Mount Biega. Both mountainous and lowland terrain are found within the park boundaries, covered with primary tropical forest that provides protection to a wide range of flora and fauna. These include around 136 species of mammals, 349 species of birds, and more than 1,170 plant species. Most famously, Kahuzi-Biéga is home to one of the largest and most studied populations of eastern lowland gorillas (known as Grauer’s gorilla or Gorilla beringei graueri) in the world. Tragically, the eastern lowland gorilla population has declined globally by 77 percent over the last 20 years, the result of logging, mining, civil unrest, and the poaching of the gorillas for meat. In 2016, the global population was estimated at fewer than 3,800. The situation in Kahuzi-Biéga has been even more drastic, with an 87 percent decline, exacerbated by the conflicts in Congo and Rwanda during the 1990s. Estimates in 2012 put the number of eastern lowland gorillas in the park at between 1,272 and 2,518 individuals in the lowland areas, and 170 in the highlands. There have, however, been some small signs of improvement in Kahuzi-Biéga. Researchers found that one gorilla population, in the highland sector of the park, has grown. In 2008, a status report put the group’s population at just 125. Thanks to the brave efforts of the park’s rangers, who risk their lives to protect the gorillas, the group has now increased in size to between 200 and 250.","Kahuzi-Biega National Park is located near the town of Bukavu in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. A decent road runs from Bukavu into the park, but you will first need to get permission to enter. This is done by requesting a letter of invitation from Kahuzi-Biega National Park. These formalities are very much necessary, both for the protection of the park and its inhabitants and for the safety of all visitors. As recently as March 2018, 27 people were abducted by Mai-Mai Raia Mutomboki militants inside the park. They were released a few weeks later. Despite this incident, the security situation remains relatively calm in Kahuzi-Biega, and tourists can enter once they have been cleared, briefed, and given the required permission to visit."
5,Gbadolite,"Gbadolite, Democratic Republic of the Congo","The ""Versailles of the Jungle"" built by a dictator is now a decaying shadow of its hubristic grandeur.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gbadolite,"Once a small village on the edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo that was barely even mentioned on most maps, Gbadolite was transformed into the extravagant seat of a dictator who changed the face of the country, but now the tiny town is a ruined complex of despotic extravagance gone to seed. When former journalist Mobutu Sese Seko took power in 1965 with the help of the CIA, he dug deep into the country’s coffers to turn his ancestral village into a glimmering jewel where he could live and entertain like a king unrivaled. Before Mobutu’s reign, Gbadolite was simply a small community of less than 2,000 people living in earthen huts, but the dictator constructed a trio of palaces nearby, a full-service airport, a hospital, a five-star hotel with over 100 rooms, and a land transportation infrastructure that could service the remote area. During Mobutu’s reign the lifestyle for the ruling powers in Gbadolite was lavish and extravagant with fine wines, rare cuisine, and full service entertainment facilities that catered to the dictator and his guests despite the poverty surrounding them and the corrupt source of the wealth. Mobutu’s rule ended in a coup in 1997 and during the ensuing war, much of the extravagant flourishes that the ruler had put in were damaged or destroyed and the shining seat of Mobutu’s power slid into ruin. Today Gbadolite is once again a remote village although some of Mobutu’s remaining supporters still tend to the remains of his crumbling palaces, conducting tours of the once gilded halls and making sure that the memory of the village’s time in the sun doesn’t completely fade.",
6,Monument to African Dictator Laurent Kabila,"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo",Built by a North Korean team this monument to African dictator Laurent Kabila has a suspiciously Kim Jong Il shaped body.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-african-dictator-laurent-kabila,"Towering in the middle of a traffic circle in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a roughly 25-foot tall statue of a bald headed, dour looking, Laurent Kabila, the former despotic leader of the DRCongo. With his finger raised to the sky, a small a book grasped in his left hand, and dressed in pleated military slacks and button up, the statue has a familiar air to it. The statue was built by a group of North Koreans artisans who work abroad as the Mansudae Overseas Project, and is among dozens of monuments the North Koreans have built throughout Africa. Ironically while North Korea’s economy and people suffer, masked by a massive government propaganda campaign, government propaganda itself has become one of North Koreas most successful exports. This is in part because the Mansudae Overseas Project provide monuments and museums for dictators and despots at bargain basement prices. But the cheap prices also come with cut corners. In this case of the Laurent Kabila statue, built by his son and current ruler of the DRC, the familiarity of Kabila to North Korean monuments may be further than stylistic. According to locals, the body on the Kabila statue belongs not to Kabila himself but to Kim Jong Il. The only modification was welding a bald and grumpy Kabila head on top. While there is no definitive proof of this - in part because there are currently only a few public statues of Kim Jong Il - it wouldn’t be the first time the Mansudae Overseas Project had been called out by one of their despotic clients for taking the easy route. The group, having been trained to specifically to produce state approved images of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong Il has had trouble creating realistic looking African faces, a problem that arose in both Mali and Senegal. The first version of Senegal’s massive African Renaissance Monument had to have their heads redesigned. “It had to have African heads, not Asian!”said Mr. Wade the 83 year old former Senegalese president who commissioned the massive statue. Despite the difficulties, the North Korean Mansudae Overseas Project is still the go to source for giant monuments of African dictators, and despite the Asiatic faces and suspiciously Kim Jong Il shaped bodies, they will likely continue to produce massive statues of corrupt leaders across the continent.",
7,Tour de l'Échangeur,"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo","Also known as the Limete Tower, la Tour de l'Échangeur can be seen from almost everywhere in Kinshasa.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tour-de-lechangeur,"Driving into Kinshasa from the N’dijili International Airport on Route National 1, one is confronted by a large tower in the Commune of Limite that is a bit awe-inspiring (given its location) and both surprising and perplexing. Known as the Tour de l’Échangeur (Interchange Tower), it remains today one of the tallest human-built structures on the African continent.A total of 689 feet (210 meters) tall, the tower was ordered built by President Mobutu Sese Seku in 1971 as a monument to Patrice Lumumba, a Congolese leader who fought for independence and who later served as the first prime minister of the country after independence in 1960 until his assassination in January 1961. The tower stands in the middle of a public square which was called Exchange Square until 2011, when its name was changed to Reconstruction Square. Today it hosts the Museum of Contemporary and Multimedia Arts which has collections of Congolese art and sculpture. A statue of Patrice Lumumba was erected in the square in January 2002.",
8,Lac Assal,"Tadjourah, Djibouti","Rimmed by white crusts of salt on every edge, Lac Assal is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lac-assal,"Lac Assal is the third saltiest body of water on the planet, saltier even than the Dead Sea. The lake lies at the bottom of a crater at the lowest point in Africa. Surrounding the lake are several dormant volcanoes and lava fields. The location has been used by locals for decades to harvest salt; hauling the goods away on camelback. While the surrounding desert and volcanos are beautiful, the turquoise blue lake contrasted against the brilliantly white salt fields is breathtaking. Every bit of ground and rock in and around the lake is coated in a thick layer of salt. Local vendors often sell salt crystals, salt incrusted rocks, skulls, and other trinkets from Lac Assal.","There aren't any facilities in the area so if you are planning on going for a dip, you'll want a way to wash the salt off. Lake Goubet or the hot springs that feed Lac Assal are both nearby options."
9,Lake Abbe,Djibouti,A salt lake dotted with steaming limestone chimneys.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-abhe,"Situated in the middle of the hot and hellish Afar Depression, Lake Abbe stretches six miles in width and is covered in clusters of massive, steam-blasting limestone chimneys. Although Lake Abbe is the ultimate destination for Ethiopia’s Awash River, its dry landscape absorbs the water, and the area is a vast landscape of salt flats. Besides Mount Dama Ali, a small dormant volcano, the landscape is almost completely level, and the steaming, sulphuric vents lend the region an apocalyptic, and Tatooine-like look. Some of the vents stretch as high as 150 feet into the air, and make the lake visible from miles around. Despite the hellish climate near Lake Abbe, nomadic Afar shepherds live in the area, along with a surprising population of flamingos.",
