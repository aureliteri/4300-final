0,El Ateneo Grand Splendid,"Buenos Aires, Argentina","This historic, palatial theater is now one of the world’s most beautiful bookstores.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-ateneo-grand-splendid,"With each incarnation since its inception in 1919—first as a performing arts theater, then as a cinema, and now a bookstore—the Grand Splendid has proven itself befitting of its majestic title. Having retained its original frescoed ceilings, ornate theater boxes, elegant rounded balconies, detailed trimmings, and plush red stage curtains, the interior of the building remains as stunning today as when it was first envisioned by architects Peró and Torres Armengol. In its glory days, the Teatro Grand Splendid hosted such tango legends as Carlos Gardel, Francisco Canaro, Roberto Firpo, and Ignacio Corsini. Building proprietor Max Glucksman was a leading figure in the world of tango in his own right, as owner of the influential Nacional-Odeon record label. In 1929, the theater underwent its first transformation to become a cinema, with the distinction of being the first in Buenos Aires to show sound film. Glucksman’s love of tango carried over to the new cinema, with live tango orchestration accompanying the silent films projections. Architect Fernando Manzone oversaw the building’s most recent conversion into the El Ateneo bookstore and music shop, to the tune of AR $3 million. Just prior to the leasing of the building to Grupo Ilhsa in 2000, the Grand Splendid was under threat of demolition due to a poor economy. Though some lament the loss of a beloved cinema, it is now thanks to the Grupo Ilhsa—which owns 40 bookshops, including the flagship Grand Splendid location—that visitors can still revel in this wondrous monument of a bygone era. While the selection of books on offer is standard chain store fare and mostly in Spanish, bibliophiles will find the staggeringly opulent display of books to be reason enough to pay El Ateneo Grand Splendid a visit. To fully bask in the splendor, one can also indulge in coffee and live piano music on the very stage where the Argentinean stars of tango once performed.",bookstores theaters film books architectural oddities architecture
1,Perito Moreno Glacier,"Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina",This stunning mass of ice spans 121 square miles and is still growing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/perito-moreno-glacier,"If you only visit one glacier in your life, Perito Moreno would be a good one to pick. It towers above the turquoise glacial water of Patagonia’s Los Glaciares National Park, beaming a blinding white and exuding cold blue hues. Unlike most of earth’s other glaciers, Perito Moreno is still growing. The Perito Moreno Glacier, named for a 19th-century explorer, is currently 19 miles long and rises an average height of 240 feet above the water. Altogether, the glacier covers about 121 square miles. It is part of an ice field located in both Argentina and Chile that is the third largest reserve of fresh water in the world. Part of an area known as Argentina’s Austral Andes, it became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1981. There are viewing platforms a safe distance from the glacier, overlooking Lake Argentino, the glacier’s terminus. You can get pretty close—to the point that you can basically feeling the glacier breathing cold air on your face. If you wait for a while, you’ll likely witness huge chunks of the ice mass fracture off and crash into the water, creating a massive, reverberating roar. There are walking paths that allow you to check out the glacier from a few different vantage points, as well as a boat that takes you on a 45-minute trip around the base. There are also trekking tours that take you out to walk on parts of the glacier itself, surrounded by the beautiful Patagonian scenery of forests and mountains. The Perito-Moreno glacier retreats during the Argentine summer, that is, from December to March (although it may begin to melt earlier), and begins to freeze after the third month.  If you're arriving via your own car, you'll need to take Provincial Route No. 15 from El Calafate, which is 80km (50 miles) and will take about an hour and a half. There are also four bus companies based in El Calafate running daily round trips for about 15 USD.",snow glaciers ice national parks
2,Iguazu Falls,"Foz do Iguaçu, Argentina",A series of waterfalls so massive they straddle the border of Argentina and Brazil.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iguazu-falls,"Flowing for the most part through Brazil, the Iguazu river breaks into upper and lower portions right on the divide between Brazil and Argentina. Depending on the water level of the river, there are between 150 and 300 separate waterfalls at the site pouring water over off a drop of 200 to 300 feet. Despite the hundreds of smaller falls that appear and disappear over the cliffs, over half of the river’s output flows through a channel known simply as the Devil’s Throat. The border between the two countries runs right down the Devil’s Throat separating, the lion’s share of the falls into the Argentinian side and the rest still pouring out of Brazil. There is a scenic overlook that is accessible from the two countries which attracts tourists from both. The Iguazu Falls may divide the river, but they also seem to bring two countries together. On the Argentinean side, you can only pay with cash and in Argentinean pesos. A two night trip is recommended to visit both the sides and rest a bit in the city. But you can visit the park in one night or even one day (only the Argentinean side). Best months to visit: March - May and August - October.",unesco waterfalls water
3,La Cueva de las Manos (Cave of Hands),Argentina,"Stenciled handprints and wall paintings dating back 10,000 years, some of the earliest forms of cave art.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-cueva-de-las-manos-cave-of-hands,"Las Cueva de las Manos is tucked in the valley of the Pinturas River, in an isolated spot of the Argentine Patagonia, accessible via long gravel dirt roads. The trip can be rough, but is undoubtably worth it: It leads you to some of the earliest known forms of human art, dating back roughly 10,000 years. The prehistoric artwork painted on the walls of this desert cave is not only ancient, but beautiful. There are three distinct styles to be seen, believed to have been created by different peoples at different time periods. But the highlight is what gives La Cueva de las Manos, or “Cave of Hands,” its name: the hundreds of colorful handprints stencilled along the cave’s walls. The hand paintings are dated to around 5,000 BC. It’s believed these cave dwellers stencilled their own hands using bone-made pipes to create the silhouettes. Most of the prints are of left hands, indicating that they probably held the spraying pipe in their right hands. The artists used different mineral pigments to make different colors—iron oxides for red and purple, kaolin for white, natrojarosite for yellow, and manganese oxide for black. There are also hunting scenes and representations of animals and human life found in the cave, dating back even further than the stencilled hands, to around 7300 BC. The hunter-gatherers who lived in the caves at this time created art depicting the pursuit of prey, the most common of which was the guanaco, a type of llama. A favorite hunting tool was the bola, where interconnected cords with weights on either end were thrown to trap the legs of the animal. A third category of art was discovered, too, with paintings depicting animals and humans in a more stylized and minimalist fashion, done largely in red pigments. Through all these varied forms of cave art, studied layer by layer, we get a peek into the lives of those who lived in the caves, thought to have last been inhabited by the ancestors of the Tehuelche people of the Patagonian desert. It was first explored by researchers in 1949, and more extensive studies were conducted in the 1960s. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999.  The cave lies in the valley of the Pinturas River, in an isolated spot in the Patagonian landscape. It is most easily reached by a gravel road (RP 41), which leaves Ruta 40 1.8 miles north of Bajo Caracoles and runs 28 miles northeast to the south side of the Pinturas Canyon. The north side of the canyon can also be reached by rough, but shorter, roads from Ruta 40. A 1.8 mile path connects the two sides of the canyon, but there is no road link. The main cave measures 79 ft in depth, with an entrance 49 ft wide, and it is initially 33 ft high. The ground inside the cave has an upward slope; inside the cave the height is reduced to no more than 7 ft.",cave paintings prehistoric paintings caves ecosystems art history
4,Xul Solar Museum,"Buenos Aires, Argentina","Xul Solar was an artist of alternate worlds, inventor of languages, and dreamer of utopias.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/xul-solar-museum,"With dreams of reforming and perfecting the universe, Argentine artist Xul Solar invented two languages, a spiritual form of chess, a modified piano, and painted works based on his own blend of cosmic mysticism. The Museo Xul Solar in Buenos Aires holds most of his art, along with documents, letters, and the “heirlooms of the cosmos” that he built. The galleries are located just below Solar’s former apartment, where his rooms are preserved along with his library of around 3,500 books. Born in Argentina in 1887 as Oscar Agustín Alejandro Schulz Solari, he later changed his name to Xul Solar, or “solar light.” His paintings of mystic worlds and alternate universes are filled with floating cities, arcane symbols, angels, winged horses, pyramids, snakes, and frightening half-breeds of airplanes and people. His vision of a utopia focused on the creation of a universal language. Believing Spanish to be several centuries out of date, marred by words that were too long and too cacophonous, he invented Neo-Criollo. It was derived from Spanish and Portuguese, with bits of French, English, Greek, and Sanskrit, and meant to be a universal language for South America. Solar tried to speak it with everyone and wrote several texts in Neo-Criollo, including “San Signos,” a collection of 64 writings based on the hexagrams of the “I Ching.” Later, he invented the more complicated Pan-Lengua, an international language rooted in math, music, astrology, and visual art. It was monosyllabic, without grammar, and had an invented script and duodecimal number system In modifying a piano to make it simpler to learn, he built three rows of colored keys for playing a hexatonic scale of his own invention. The colors of the keys corresponded to the colors in his paintings, using the canvas as sheet music. Solar’s efforts at merging spiritualism with art included starting a puppet theatre for adults that presented religious and poetic works, with the characters representing the 12 astrological signs. He dreamed of a self-sufficient city in outer space that would be a “celestial Jerusalem” and believed that flying cities could solve the world’s overpopulation problem. Xul Solar also invented and modified games to fit his new rules for the universe. With soccer, he asked: “Why play with only one ball, and not with three or four, and divide the field into six or twelve parallel sectors, like in rugby, and each player wear a shirt with different letters so that words and phrases are formed?” Pan Chess, his spiritual and complex version of chess, was played on a 13x13 board instead of 8x8 and had constantly changing rules based in the Pan-Lengua language. The rules could at once be a collection of music notes, a dictionary for the creation of new languages, and a way to ask “What are we playing?” When he died in 1963, he was clutching a rosary he’d made himself out of 71 pieces of painted wood. His wife Lita said that he “did not believe in death, for him there would always be a tomorrow.”",invented languages utopia week utopias outsider art museums and collections museums
5,Cementerio de la Recoleta,"Buenos Aires, Argentina","Buenos Aires' city of the dead contains some very famous remains, including Eva Perón.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/recoleta-cemetery,"Recoleta Cemetery, in the upscale Recoleta Barrio of Buenos Aires, is the final resting place of many of Argentina’s wealthiest and most famous families and personages. The mausoleums are fairly small, befitting the size of the cemetery in an urban setting, and it’s common for many members, generations even, of the same family occupy one mausoleum. The layout of the cemetery was designed by the French engineer Próspero Catelin, and was remodeled in 1881, while Torcuato de Alvear was mayor of the city, by the Italian architect Juan Antonio Buschiazzo. The cemetery includes graves of some of the most influential and important Argentinians, including several presidents, scientists, and wealthy characters. Internationally, Eva Perón is the best-known person buried in this cemetery. There’s also the tomb of Rufina Cambacérès who was buried alive. The entrance to the cemetery is through neo-classical gates with tall Greek columns. The cemetery contains many elaborate marble mausoleums, decorated with statues, in a wide variety of architectural styles. The entire cemetery is laid out in sections like city blocks, with wide tree-lined main walkways branching into sidewalks filled with mausoleums. While many of the mausoleums are in fine shape and well-maintained, others have fallen into disrepair. Many can be found with broken glass and littered with rubbish, the coffins exposed. The cemetery has become a haven for stray cats, who sleep amongst the graves and mausoleums. Each mausoleum has the family name etched into the facade; brass or bronze plaques are added to the front for particular family members. La Recoleta is one of those cemeteries where the tradition of engraving a death date but no birth date has been maintained.  Its really easy to find it, first go on in the Las Heras avenue, until you find Junin, so in Junin you continue 2 blocks until you find Vicente Lopez street, and you will see a really big wall.",memento mori burial places cemeteries
6,La Manzana de las Luces,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",A gateway to a mysterious network of underground tunnels.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/manzana-de-las-luces,"The Manzana de las Luces, or “Block of the Lights,” housed the activities of the early Jesuit missionaries in the nascent Buenos Aires, and as a complex comprises the church of San Ignacio, a cloister residence, a large arcaded patio, and colonial-era administrative building. Although once housing Argentina’s first national library, college, and even the country’s legislature, Manzana de las Luces’s notoriety derives in part from its function as a central point in Buenos Aires’ mysterious subterranean tunnel system. The tunnels likely date from as early as the late 17th century, and given the paucity of any records or mention of the tunnels’ construction, remain shrouded in mystery. The first documented report of an uncovered tunnel came in 1865, and interest in the tunnel network reappeared during a project to drain the neighborhood of San Telmo, when engineers discovered more tunnels. The tunnels range in size, and some lead to large, vaulted chambers. Many have caved in, and the city government demolished many more to make way for the “A” line of the Buenos Aires subway system in the early 20th century. Opinions as to the tunnels’ functions range widely, since the history of their construction remains the stuff of urban legend, and speculation ranges from a defensive or escape network for troops or clergy, to secret chambers for inquisition-style torture, to a clandestine system for smuggling contraband. Daniel Schávelzon, author of The Tunnels of Buenos Aires and the head of the Center for Urban Archaeology, says the tunnels likely indicate an incomplete project initiated by the Jesuits to connect the city’s churches underground. Although chambers and tunnels exist directly under and around religious, government, or military buildings, many of these smaller networks do not ultimately connect. Many tunnels remain undiscovered, however, and may remain secret, perhaps still serving some mysterious function, unknown to the oblivious Argentinians who walk above them. It’s believed these tunnels were the inspiration for those featured in the famous chapter “Report on the Blind”  in the novel On Heroes and Tombs, widely considered to be the literary magnum opus of the writer Ernesto Sabato.

7,Caminito,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",A bright little alley in La Boca is a part of tango history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/caminito,"“Desde que se fue triste vivo yo, caminito, amigo, yo también me voy,” sang Carlos Gardel, the tango toast of Argentina. With these mournful words he made a tiny stretch of buildings in La Boca, Buenos Aires famous. The line in the song roughly translates to “Since she left I’ve lived in sadness; the alley, my friend. Now I’m also leaving” and the alley in question is Caminito, a colorful little path in Buenos Aires’ La Boca neighborhood. Well, sort of. Curiously, the lyrics to the tango Caminito come from a poem, written by poet Gabino Coria Penaloza, and are in reference to a different alley, this one in the village of Olta in the province of La Rioja. The writer of the song, however, the composer Juan de Dios Filiberto, was inspired to write the song by the brightly colored Caminito in La Boca, and put Filiberto’s poem to music. So the lyrics of Caminito reference one alley, while the music is inspired by another. As is the case with many romanticized places, Caminito itself actually came from unsavory origins. Initially it was a bridge over a tiny stream, but when that dried up it was filled in. Later it housed railways which soon ended up abandoned, and after that, a dump. Caminito owes its restoration to artist Benito Quinquela Martín, known for painting the rough port life around La Boca. In the 1950s, Quinquela Martín began painting the buildings of Caminito vibrant colors, and eventually built a small stage at the end of the walk. His tenacity established the path as an artists’ community, and in combination its tango fame, Caminito lives on as a Buenos Aires landmark.",alleyways color music history
8,Palacio Barolo,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",A tower devoted to — and modeled after — the Divine Comedy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-barolo,"Located a minute’s walk from Argentina’s national legislature, at the end of Buenos Aires’ Avenida de Mayo, the Palacio Barolo, once South America’s tallest building, still towers above the neighboring structures. Work began on the building in 1919 and was completed in 1923, but its attraction extends far beyond its former title, or even its place among Buenos Aires’ scads of building-relics from its golden age as an emerging world capital. Conceived of by cotton magnate Luis Barolo and architect Mario Palanti as a secular temple, the Palacio Barolo serves as an allegory for the structure and content of Dante Allighieri’s Divine Comedy. Believing that Europe had begun drifting toward collapse, Barolo intended the Palacio Barolo to house Dante’s ashes far away from a disintegrating European continent. His partnership with Italian architect Mario Palanti, also a Dante aficionado, resulted in the design of a structure that included the numbers most prevalent in the Divine Comedy: The building’s 22 floors (Dante divided the Divine Comedy into 22 stanzas) sit upon a foundation whose measurements conform to the golden ratio. And, like Dante’s work, the building invites visitors to progress through hell, purgatory, and heaven as they climb to the top. The lobby, a central hall adorned with inscriptions of Latin verse and monster statues, radiates out from a central dome into nine vaulted archways, which represent the nine circles of hell as described by Dante in the Inferno. Throughout these first three floors are geometric figures representing alchemical symbols for fire, the colors of the Italian flag, and Masonic symbols on the walls, floors, and still-operating antiquated elevators. The highest levels, representing heaven, begin at an observation deck with one of the few 360 degree views of the sprawling city of Buenos Aires. Climbing a few more floors to the building’s highest point (100 meters, analogous to the 100 cantos of the Divine Comedy), one arrives at a still-working lighthouse. Like the Pillars of Hercules at the mouth of the Mediterranean, Pilanti intended this tower light and another of his buildings, the Palacio Salvo in Montevideo, Uruguay, to serve as a welcome to visitors arriving from the Atlantic to the Rio de la Plata estuary. The ornament above the lighthouse, a figure of the Southern Cross constellation, aligns with the actual constellation on July 9th, Argentine Independence Day.

Also known as Monte Fitz Roy, this impressive mountain is situated between Argentina and Chile in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, and it is undeniably one of the most beautiful hiking areas in Patagonia. Francisco Moreno first saw the mountain in 1877, and he named it after Robert FitzRoy, captain of the HMS Beagle, who, alongside Charles Darwin, charted much of the Patagonian coast in the 1830’s. Cerro Fitz Roy is now part of Los Glaciares National Park, and it is a major attraction for visitors from around the world. The mountain can be seen from the nearby little village of El Chaltén, but the most spectacular vistas can only be accessed on foot by hiking the many trails surrounding the peak. Hikers can do day-treks, or they can rent camping gear and spend days exploring the area and meeting people along the way. The trails wind through incredibly diverse landscapes of beautifully wooded areas, open fields, and massive boulders. These paths lead to a number of pristine lakes with glaciers and the peaks of Fitz Roy serving as their backdrops. The glacial water in the streams and lakes along the hikes is potable. One thing to be sure not to miss is a sunrise hike to Lago de los Tres to see Fitz Roy lit up in the color of pink roses. The hikes range in difficulty from easy to challenging, so it is best to ask locals for advice in the visitor center of El Chaltén before setting out. The months between November and April are the best times to visit, but weather can be bad in this area and almost impossible to predict.

Rescued by amateur historian and Argentine chemical engineer Jorge Eckstein in 1985, the structure took 17 years to restore to its current condition. More than 130 truckloads of debris were unearthed from the structure’s tunnels. In that debris, Eckstein discovered French tiles, African pipes, English china, and many other precious objects.

Arriving by train, as many as 5,000 visitors at a time could relax in lavish quarters after taking advantage of the therapeutic waters of Lago Epecuén. The mountain lake was unusual in that its waters were saltier than any ocean—in fact, it was second only to the Dead Sea in salt content, and people suffering from depression, diabetes, and everything in-between came to soak in its healing waters—the very waters that would eventually harbor the village’s ruin. In what can only be described as a freak occurrence, a rare weather pattern developed over Villa Epecuen in 1985, causing a seiche (standing wave) in the lake. The seiche broke a dam and then shoved its way through the dike. While the devastation was slow, it was thorough—the inevitable flood gradually devoured the entire village, submerging it under more than 30 ft. of briny waters. 280 businesses and countless personal dwellings disappeared under the surface like a modern-day Atlantis. It wasn’t until 2009 that drier weather allowed the waters to retreat enough for the town to reemerge. The damage total, the village was deemed a disaster area offering no incentive to rebuild. What remains now is an eerie ghost town with rows and rows of dead, naked trees, decrepit buildings, and an entire landscape seemingly bleached out and stripped to the bone by the once-healing salt waters that ravaged everything in sight.",salt underwater disaster areas water abandoned
12,Campanópolis,"González Catán, Argentina",An Argentinian businessman facing terminal cancer built this whimsical medieval village using salvaged materials.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/campanopolis,"Antonio Campana was a self-made supermarket millionaire. When he was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer, he decided to sell everything and dedicate the rest of his life to building a dream. The land he purchased in 1976 for his vision sits at the confluence of two streams and abuts an ecological preserve. However, the pastoral location was quickly spoiled when a state agency expropriated the property for use as a landfill. By the time Campana’s lengthy legal battle to regain possession of the land was finally successful, it was already buried under several years’ worth of garbage. While the land was no longer fit for cattle grazing (which had originally been part of his plan), he was undeterred in his architectural ambitions. After leveling the land and carting off 2 million cubic meters of garbage, construction finally began in 1980 on what would become the enchanting medieval village of Campanópolis. It is a complete small village, built in an eclectic style that has invited comparisons to a Tim Burton film set. Buildings are mostly made with items recovered from the demolition of other buildings and sold as salvage. Throughout the construction process, Campana trawled countless auctions buying up doors, fences, gates, and columns, as well as decorative details like an antique barber chair, an old elevator, and one hundred typewriters. One important part of the village is made from materials gathered from discontinued railroad lines. All of this work was designed and directed by a man who had no background in architecture and drew up plans on the fly as the project evolved. In addition to the village, Campana also planted more than 100,000 trees and other plants. Overall, the village takes up about 50 acres (20 hectares) of the 495-acre (200-hectare) property; the surreal scene features fountains, bridges, an artificial lake with docks, a town church, a Dutch windmill, cobblestone streets, a “Museum of Wood” and a “House of Slag,” as well as countless other buildings, towers, passages, and secret nooks to explore. Told in 1976 that he had only five years to live, Campana survived for another 24 years, during which time he worked tirelessly on Campanópolis. When he died, further development stopped; his sons now maintain the place, but the additional plans dreamed up by the grocery-magnate-turned-medieval-city-planner remain unfinished.  Open only on Wednesdays and Fridays in the afternoon and Saturdays in the morning, visits must be reserved and paid for in advance via the official website (there is not a ticket office). The cost is about 7USD each one. The site is about 20 miles southwest of Buenos Aires, 2 miles south from González Catán station and 2km southwest from the km29 crossroad (Independencia station). If you want to come by public transport, you may take the Belgrano Sur train to González Catán station (NOT M. C. Belgrano ramal), and take the ""truchito"" bus in Posamay and Simon Perez. This bus can only be paid with AR$ bills (not Sube card) and has stop just in front of Campanopolis (Zelada and Bariloche) There is a ramal of 622 bus from Laferrere station too, it has a stop in Zelada and Bariloche. Or you can take the 88 bus in Once station to the Km31 and thake the truchito there. A taxi from Buenos Aires could be pocket-rape and less than 10% of taxis would come to Catán.

13,Laguna del Diamante,"Laguna Diamante, Argentina",A toxic lake near a volcanic caldera that is home to flamingos and other life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laguna-del-diamante,"At Laguna del Diamante, there are plenty of reasons why life should not exist. To start with, the lagoon rests amongst sulphur-spewing vents within one of the world’s largest volcanic calderas - belonging to the active Argentinean volcano Cerro Galán. And it’s not just the poisonous gases you have to look out for. The hyper alkaline lagoon (with a pH level of 11) is five times saltier than sea water and has levels of arsenic that are 20,000 times higher than the amount deemed safe for drinking by the EPA. Aside from the harmful gases and toxic water, the altitude of the site presents even more dangers to life at the lagoon. At 4,600 meters above sea level, oxygen levels are low and ultraviolet light from the sun is 40% more intense than it is in the lowlands. It was quite a surprise, then, when Argentinean scientists exploring Laguna in early 2010 discovered a flock of flamingos thriving on a healthy population of particularly resistant microorganisms. Rocks at the lagoon are covered with mats of unidentified microbes, which the colony of flamingos relies on for food. Though flamingos are considered a hardy species with a knack for adapting to different conditions, the environment at Laguna del Diamante is the most extreme that the birds have been witnessed living in. The conditions at Laguna are also thought to be quite similar to those of the early Earth. Scientists are therefore hoping that studying the lagoon’s mysterious microorganisms will help reveal how life on Earth began. Another puzzle that remains to be solved is the identification of a red crystal compound that also grows on the lagoon’s rocks. Preliminary results from an X-ray diffraction study (a method for examining the structure and geometry of crystals) failed to reveal the presence of any known minerals. The case of Laguna del Diamante just serves to demonstrate not only life’s resilience but also the strange and unexpected forms it takes on to survive in Earth’s most hostile environs.",volcanoes lakes geological oddities water geology animals

The Ischigualasto Provincial Park is huge at more than 230 square miles and is high above sea level at more than 4,000 feet. The park features all of the vegetation you would typically find in this area - some small trees, cacti, and bushes - and is very dry with extreme temperatures. A near constant wind and little rainfall (almost all of which occurs during the summer) make this a harsh environment that is easy to visit but difficult to live in. The park gets its nickname, the Valley of the Moon, because of the rugged, otherworldly geological structures that dot the landscape. Millions of years ago, this area was a floodplain dominated by strong rivers and rainfall. In the time of the dinosaurs, these rock deposits were formed slowly over time and have stood ever since. Some of these rocks are as round and smooth as marbles because of the constant wind that has shaped them through erosion. Among the rocks, giant (some more than 130 feet tall) petrified tree trunks attest to the rich vegetation that once fed the similarly giant creatures that walked among them.

17,The Tomb of Rufina Cambacérès,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",A beautiful young girl said to have been buried alive in her coffin…,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tomb-of-rufina-cambaceres-buenos-aires-argentina,"The Cementario de la Recoleta in Buenos Aires, Argentina, is easily one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world. Designed by French engineer Próspero Catelin and remodeled in 1881, the cemetery is a Victorian neoclassical explosion, with ornate mausoleums at every turn. Meant to house Argentina’s rich and famous, the crypts and gravestones are huge baroque masterpieces, mimicking the architecture of the city’s wealthy houses. Among the cemetery’s elite are Eva Peron, Nobel winner Luis F. Leloir, and Isabel Walewski Colonna, grandchild of Napoleón Bonaparte. One gravestone not belonging to anyone particularly famous, however, embodies one of the cemetery’s most interesting—and horrifying—stories. Rufina Cambacérès was born into a wealthy family, heirs to a large cattle fortune, and her father Eugenio Cambacérès, was a well known writer and politician. Rufina suffered an early tragedy when her father died of tuberculosis when she was only four years old. In 1902, Rufina was nineteen and had grown into a beautiful young woman, and something of a Buenos Aires socialite. While getting ready to attend a show, Rufina suddenly and without warning collapsed onto the floor. (Many modern versions of this story include a bit about this being caused by a scandalous revelation, something about her boyfriend sleeping with his own mother, but this is almost certainly a fabrication added on later to spice up the story.) Doctors were called in, and supposedly all three doctors pronounced the young Rufina dead of a heart attack. Rufina was put in a coffin and sealed in her mausoleum, and a funeral was held. A few days after the funeral, a cemetery worker found that the coffin had moved within the crypt and the lid was broken in places. Fearing grave robbery, he opened it to find something even worse—scratch marks covering the inside of the coffin, and Rufina dead, hands and face bruised from having tried to break her way out of the coffin. The explanation doctors were said to have given later is that Rufina had suffered a attack of “catalepsy” (the classic buried-alive diagnosis, and the one used in Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Premature Burial”) and later awakened in her coffin, only to die of exhaustion and shock. Or so the legend goes. The tale has all the earmarks of a urban legend, and, as it is quite difficult to find any evidence to support it, it’s almost certainly untrue. What actually happened to Rufina is difficult to determine, though she did die at the age of nineteen, and the part about a cemetery worker finding her casket moved and broken may be true as well. The rest is likely the result of overactive local imaginations. Her tomb is a stunning Art Nouveau masterpiece and features a full-sized statue of Rufina holding the door to her own mausoleum, said to have been built by her mother as a tribute to what happened to her.",memento mori catacombs and crypts monuments statues

Built in 2012 by the art collective known as DOMA, Coloso was their entry in the Technopolis art and design event. The wire frame construction stands almost 150 feet tall and looks like a normal electricity pylon save for the shoulder spikes and the arms dangling at its sides. Neon lights are attached to a number of the beams so that at night, the whole thing lights up and is able to really shine. The chest area, or “heart” strobes and creates patterns while the robot’s face animates into various moods with smiles and winks. While not as menacing as many of the giant robots found in science fiction and film stories, and not quite as cuddly as some other popular automatons, Coloso certainly is one of the best power pylons ever created.",robots art
19,Puente del Inca,"Luján de Cuyo, Argentina",A brightly colored natural bridge formed by mineral-rich hot springs high up in the Andes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/puente-del-inca,"Despite its name, Puente del Inca (Inca Bridge) was not built by the ancient Inca civilization (unless you believe the old story that it was formed when the Inca king’s guards were mineralized in place as they made a bridge for him to walk upon). Rather, it is a natural arch carved by glacial melt, and coated in minerals that formed its brightly colored hues. The colorful bridge over the Las Cuevas River is located about 120 miles west of Mendoza, and quite a bit higher in the Andes than the town. As you drive up the slopes, the road passes abandoned railroad stations, rocky Inca messenger huts, and glacial valleys, criss-crossing the Mendoza river several times. Arriving at Puente del Inca, you’ll approach a collection of sheds selling local crafts, a few restaurants of varying quality, and more than a few of the omnipresent Argentinian stray dogs. A short walk through the souvenir sheds leads to the bridge. Many geologic processes contributed to the formation of this unique bridge. It began as a glacial valley (one of many). Then came the mineral deposits, in shades of red, yellow, and brown. The area had several mineral hot springs that led the colorful layers. A river formed later, during the glacial melt, and carved its way through the mineral deposits, forming the natural arch. A century ago, this area had been a spa resort, with a hotel, a church, and a small village. The spa was tucked into the side of the cliff, almost underneath the natural bridge. Then, a spring flood destroyed the buildings—even carrying the original roof of the church off and depositing it in the middle of a village lower down. Despite this, tourists could still cross the Puente del Inca for years after the disaster, until a more recent flood weakened the bridge to the point that it was deemed no longer safe for foot traffic. The hot springs have been regarded as therapeutic, including by the Inca, but now they are also used to create mineralized souvenirs. Items are placed in one of the springs for several days until they are crusted over with minerals. The souvenir sheds sold various items, such as glass bottles, that had been treated in this manner.   If you visit, dress warmly as, even in the height of summer, a cold wind blows down from the towering mountains. The area of Puente del Inca is located between the two trail-heads for starting a climb to Aconcagua, the highest mountain peak in the western hemisphere.",natural springs incas hot springs mountains bridges water geology

Here you’ll find a handsome sign marking the end of National Route 3, the last leg of the Pan-American Highway network. This is the farthest south you can drive in the Western Hemisphere. Near the sign is a boardwalk leading out to the bay, a remote fjord at the tip of Argentine Patagonia. The fjord is a branch of the Beagle Channel, which was named after the boat carrying Charles Darwin on his journey. The area is still popular among naturalists looking for sea birds, dolphins, and other cold-water animals. Most of the land around the bay is now protected. This secluded wilderness has been inhabited for 10,000 years, recently only by the indigenous Yámana people, who gave the bay its name, which means “Bay of Forests” in the native Yámana language. They were known to build fires as a form of communication between islands, which inspired the name Tierra del Fuego, or “Land of Fire.” The rough seas and sub-polar climate were scarcely seen by outsiders until the 1600s. From this bay, you would sail west and quickly be in the Pacific Ocean, or east and be in the Atlantic.  Bahia Lapataia is located within Tierra del Fuego National Park. A great place to start or end a serious road trip, the ""End of the World"" is about a 45-minute drive from Ushuaia (a popular destination for winter sports most the year).

Hard to reach, the thermal pools are tucked into a spot that rests high in the mountains, several kilometers past the interpretive center on a gravel road near a small sandwich joint that plays 80s music for tourists. It makes sense that, because many believe that the bottled water from these mineral springs offers special properties, they would also believe that bathing in the waters can heal physical and emotional wounds. The site was known hundreds of years ago, but it wasn’t until 1902 that locals started speaking about the springs’ therapeutic values. In 1941, a Great Hotel was built in the area to help draw in more tourists.

23,Glaciarium,"El Calafate, Argentina",This glacier interpretation center houses the world’s only bar made completely from glacial ice.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glaciarium,"Just outside the trekking and climbing hotspot of El Calafate in Argentine Patagonia sits the Glaciarium, a modern glacier interpretation center that’s also home to the world’s only bar made entirely of glacial ice. The small town of El Calafate (pop. 6,143) is a hotspot for trekkers, climbers, nature lovers and adventurers who come to explore the nearby Los Glaciares National Park, a region of Magellanic subpolar forests, west Patagonian steppes and, as the name suggests, glaciers. About 30 percent of the national park is covered by ice from the massive ice cap located in this part of the Andes, which feeds almost 50 glaciers in the region. One of the most famous glaciers, Perito Moreno, is located within the park, about 40 miles west of El Calafate. All in all, it’s a fantastic place to do some glacier spotting and if you want to learn more about glaciers, you can head to the Glaciarium, a modern glacier interpretation center just outside of El Calafate. Here, multimedia exhibitions explain how ice is formed and how glaciers move and shape their surroundings. They delve back to the origins of the Universe and the various glaciations on Earth, and cover the early explorers and scientists whose research gave us a far better understanding of the processes involved. You can also see a large 3D model of the Southern Patagonia Ice-Field and the numerous glaciers in the region. If all this sounds a little too serious, you need not to fear. Even the least scientifically-curious person has a reason to visit the Glaciarium: the Glaciobar. Billed as the world’s only bar made completely from glacial ice, including the seats, tables, and the glasses, the Glaciobar is so cold that you can only enter after donning the capes, gloves, and boots provided by the bar’s hardy staff. Even then, you can only stay in the bar for 20 minutes or risk becoming a permanently frozen fixture.  The Glaciarium is located about four miles to the west of central El Calafate, just off the road that leads out to the Perito Moreno Glacier. It’s open every day from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. The entrance fee is 480 Argentine pesos ($11 US). Entrance to the Glaciobar is 300 pesos ($7 US), which includes a drink. There’s a free shuttle bus from the center of El Calafate to the Glaciarium; it normally leaves from 1 de Mayo, between Av Libertador and Roca, but best to check that in advance with your hotel.",
24,Fuente de las Nereidas,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",This beautiful fountain was sculpted by a female artist who was ahead of her time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fuente-de-las-nereidas,"Despite its central location on the coast of Buenos Aires, tourists haven’t quite yet discovered the lovely riverside walk that holds one of the most beautiful fountains in the city. La Fuente de las Nereidas depicts the mythical story of the birth of the Greek goddess Venus, who sits naked atop a seashell while nereids (sea nymphs) and tritons dance around her. The statue created a scandal when it was first unveiled in 1903 by the Argentine sculptress Lola Mora. The story of the woman behind this provocative creation is little-known to many of the visitors that enjoy their Sunday walks around the fountain. Dolores Candelaria Mora Vega, who became known as Lola Mora, was ahead of her time in many ways. She wanted to achieve the same artistic glory as her male colleagues at the turn of the 20th century and found herself the subject of many rumors and controversies as she blazed that trail, breaking many rules along the way about what a woman was “supposed” to do. The daughter of a wealthy man, she took private lessons with an Italian painter, Santiago Falcucci, who instructed her in his neoclassicist and romantic style. At a young age, she presented her work at an art gallery and it became a scandal because she was a woman. She later won a scholarship and studied in Rome with Italian artists Francesco Paolo Michetti and Giulio Monteverde. She later returned to Buenos Aires and began making plans for the fountain that would be her most well-known work. The city of Buenos Aires commissioned the sculpture and the original plan was to place it in the center of the Plaza de Mayo, the historical heart of the city. She sculpted each piece in Rome and then brought them to Buenos Aires. When the white marble sculpture was unveiled in 1903, people were horrified by the display of female nudity, and the fact that it was made by a woman only added to the controversy. The work was eventually moved to Puerto Madero where it stands today as a magnificent depiction of feminine beauty that time has finally caught up with.  You can get to the fountain by bus or subway to Paseo Colón or Av. Juana Manso and walk from there. A few years ago, people could still play with the water from the fountain, but today it is protected by thick glass.

One of the people responsible for its fame on the global stage was the tango singer Carlos Gardel, a national icon in Argentina. Among the first to put words to tango music, he composed his own romantic music and sang it on world tours, and even starred in a few movies. After his tragic death at the age of 45, he was interred at the Chacarita Cemetery, a vast necropolis in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, built in the 19th century after a yellow fever epidemic led to overcrowding of the existing cemeteries. Gardel’s mausoleum, an elaborate monument, is one of the most visited tombs in the complex. Fans sometimes leave a lit cigarette in the statue’s hand and the spot is especially popular on his birth anniversary. Chacarita Cemetery contains whole avenues of quirky and impressive mausolea and monuments, and its tango connection doesn’t end with Gardel. A statue of tango composer Osvaldo Pugliese tapping at the piano stands near Gardel’s grave, and legendary bandoneon player Anibal Troilo is shown with his beloved instrument. Carlos di Sarli, the orchestra leader, too, is buried at Chacarita, as is the poet Alfonsina Storni, whose mausoleum is striking in its style.

27,Butch Cassidy's Cabin,"Cushamen, Argentina","With the Wild Bunch hunted almost to extinction and the law closing in on him, Butch Cassidy fled to this remote cabin in Argentina.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/butch-cassidys-cabin,"A wood cabin in the Lake District of Argentine Patagonia is the perfect place to retire. Unless you’re a career outlaw with a penchant for robbery and the Pinkerton Detective Agency hot on your trail. For Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, settling down was never really an option. By the end of 1900, the Wild Bunch were feeling the heat. The gang was being whittled down, killed or incarcerated at a worrying rate. For Butch Cassidy, it was time to get out of Dodge. And the USA. Along with Harry Alonzo Longabaugh, better known as the Sundance Kid, and the Kid’s female companion, the strikingly pretty Etta Place, Cassidy headed for Argentina. On February 20, 1901, the trio boarded the British steamer Herminius destined for Buenos Aires. From there, they headed for cowboy territory: the rugged landscapes of Patagonia. The gunslingers purchased a four-room cabin on the banks of the Rio Branco, tucked away on a swath of secluded land outside the small village of Cholila in the Chubut Province. For a while, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid lay low, at least as far as we know. In a letter to a friend back in the U.S., Cassidy explained how much he liked this part of the world, even considering settling down for good: “I own 300 heads of cattle, 1500 heads of sheep and 28 riding horses. I have 2 helpers, a nice four room house, barns, a stable and a henhouse… the only thing I need is a cook, since I am still unpleasantly single and many times feel lonely.” But men like Cassidy rarely get to settle down. It’s hard to kick the habits of a lifetime, and even harder to waste a very particular set of skills. On February 14, 1905, two men held up the Banco de Tarapacá y Argentino. The bank was in Río Gallegos, about 650 miles south of Cholila. A fair distance, but the two English-speaking bandits may well have been Butch and Sundance. The robbery, which netted around $100,000 by today’s standards, certainly fit the pair’s modus operandi. Less than three months later, Butch and Sundance began to get nervous, fearing the law was closing in on the ranch. They were right. The Pinkerton Agency was on to them, just waiting for the brutal winter to pass before making their move. Luckily for Butch and Sundance, a local Sheriff of Welsh descent tipped them off. They had time to sell the ranch before fleeing north to Bariloche and then west into Chile, never to return to the cabin near Cholila. Over the years, the cabin fell into a state of disrepair. By the end of the 1990s, it was ready to collapse. But in 2007, local authorities finally went in to save the building. Today, Butch Cassidy’s cabin remains a secluded spot with no real tourist infrastructure, and not a whole lot to see. But if you grew up with 1969’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, you won’t have any trouble conjuring up images of the two roguish outlaws, while whistling “Raindrops keep fallin’ on my head…”",wild west crime politics houses homes history

Opened by a German hotelier in 1897, the opulent accommodation saw many rich and famous guests walk up its grand Carrara marble stairs, including Argentine presidents, actors, and even Albert Einstein. Unfortunately, the story of the Edén would be tainted by another type of guest. In the years leading up to World War II, it was a popular retreat for Nazi officials. At one point its owners had ties to Adolf Hitler himself. (Some say the Führer actually stayed at the hotel.) When Argentina officially declared war against Germany in 1945, the Argentinian government seized the Eden Hotel because of its links to the enemy, and used it to house diplomats during the war. After the war ended, there were several attempts to restore the hotel to its former glory, but all proved unsuccessful. The hotel closed in 1965, and has sat abandoned and deteriorating for many years. The crumbling structure was declared a Historical Monument in 1988, and that brought the necessary funds to reopen the historic architectural wonder as a museum. Restoration is ongoing, but today the hotel is open for visitors and offers historical tours. You can see the different areas of the hotel, including the dining room, the solarium, the service area. The hotel also had its own power generator, a massive washing room believed to prevent tuberculosis, a big pool, a tennis court, and stables.

He obtained a field on the outskirts of town and set to work building a beacon that could guide the aliens to Earth. Supposedly, interplanetary beings contacted Jaisli one night in November 2008. While illuminated by the light of a UFO’s beam, he received a telepathic message from the aircraft’s captain. “If you build it, we will go,” it purportedly said, sounding like a character from an otherworldly version of Field of Dreams. So build it Jaisli did. As per the aliens’ instructions, he created a cluster of enormous, multi-pointed stars built from piles of rocks. The largest stars are white, but there are some smaller dark brown ones in the mix as well. The site boasts a few other landmarks, like a stack of scorched wood. From the ground, it’s hard to appreciate how striking the patterns look from the air. But on the other hand, this vantage point lets you get a close look at just how large those rocks are and be amazed that one person built all of this while working at an elevation of more than 7,200 feet. It’s unclear whether the aliens appreciate the landmark, though, as they have yet to be sighted.  To get to the Ovnipuerto from Cachi, take the road toward Cachi Adentro.

32,La Casa Mínima,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",The narrowest house in Buenos Aires is less than 10 feet wide.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-casa-minima,"As you walk down Pasaje San Lorenzo in the San Telmo district of Buenos Aires, keep an eye out for house number 380. It’s a charming sight, but such a sliver of a building that you could easily miss it. The tiny home, known as La Casa Mínima, is the narrowest in the Argentine capital. According to local legend, it was once owned by a freed slave. At its widest point, La Casa Mínima measures just 8.2 feet (2.5 meters) across. Its façade is marked by an old wooden door, painted green, above which sits a miniscule second-floor balcony. The house is painted white, with some of the original clay bricks poking through where the paint has peeled away. In terms of depth, the house extends a comparatively generous 42 feet (13 meters) from front to rear. Still, it remains a notably narrow slice of Argentine architecture. Locals, and in particular local tour guides, tell a widely repeated tale about the building’s history. This popular account claims that La Casa Mínima was a gift from the Urquiza family to one of their former slaves. The tiny house was supposedly given to the African slave in 1813, shortly after his liberation. A lack of any supporting evidence isn’t the only problem with this story. It’s true, and perhaps just a little too coincidental, that gradual abolition was introduced in Argentina in 1813, when the Free Womb Act was introduced, “freeing” all babies born to slave mothers. However, slavery wasn’t truly abolished in Argentina until 1853; Buenos Aires had to wait until even later, in 1861. The idea, therefore, that a freed slave might be given a home, albeit it a tiny one, in Buenos Aires in 1813 seems unlikely, but the story has helped maintain interest in the building, and, more importantly, has done its part in raising awareness of the history of slavery in Buenos Aires and Argentina. According to actual historical studies of La Casa Mínima, including its owners and inhabitants, the building’s history is far more prosaic. Originally, the building in which La Casa Mínima now stands was once a single home measuring a respectable 52.5 feet (16 meters) wide. Over time, however, it was slowly divided up to be rented out or sold off to various inhabitants. Thanks to some particularly bad math and dubious planning, the owners managed to end up with an extraneous slice in the middle. Rather than try to rectify the matter by including it in one of the neighboring homes, they decided to turn it into a standalone abode: the narrowest of its kind in the capital.",slavery houses homes architectural oddities architecture

The Borges Memorial Maze in Argentina is a beautiful hedge maze at its most basic level, but takes on more aspects depending on the perspective. Located on the grounds of the mid-1800s fort-cum-estate-grounds Finca Los Alamos, the maze was created in 2003 by diplomat, maze designer, and Borges friend, Randoll Coate. Borges’ history with the Finca Los Alamos goes back to before the creation of the maze as he had also had a personal relationship with writer Susana Bombal who had taken over the site in the 1930s. However Coates’ maze firmly planted (pun intended) Borges’ legacy at the site. The maze is spread out across over 66,000 square feet of land, comprising over 12,000 box hedges. On the whole, the maze is shaped like an open book with the spine running down the center. Within the confines of the pages, the twisting hedges also spell out “Borges,” both forward and then in a mirror image. Borges may not have been alive to see this monument to his life and work, but given his interest in mazes, layers, and labyrinths, it’s easy to think that he would have appreciated it.",hedge mazes mazes literature memorials

35,Mafalda Monument,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",These small sculptures pay homage to the lovable star of an iconic Argentine comic strip.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mafalda-monument,"The incredibly popular “Mafalda” comic has a long history. Created by Quino (full name Joaquín Salvador Lavado Tejón), it was first published in Argentina in 1964 as part of a sales ad. But the sweet little girl with the snappy comments and smart observations about the grownup world went on to become a sensation across Latin America and the globe. Mafalda is a six-year-old girl with an endearing concern for humanity and the state of the world, as well as a notable distaste for soup. The comic was translated in many languages, and Mafalda and her friends are relatable and lovable everywhere they go. The characters have become a cornerstone of Argentina’s popular culture, and especially in Buenos Aires. In her honor, a small sculpture of Mafalda sitting on a park bench was erected in San Telmo, the neighborhood where she lives in the comic stories. Two of her friends, Manolito and Susanita, were added later. People usually stumble across these tiny tributes by chance. It’s always a pleasant surprise, and fans will even line up to have their photo taken with the beloved characters.  The statues are right on the street so you can see them at any hour, every day. On weekends, there is often a line of fans waiting to take a photo with the characters, so best to go weekdays to avoid any wait. On Sundays there is a fair so the street is closed to cars, but you can walk to the statues. Nearby is a gift shop dedicated to Quino and Mafalda.",comic books children's literature pop culture culture sculptures statues
36,Casa Redonda,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",A mysterious architectural gem in one of the most elegant areas of Buenos Aires.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-redonda,"The Casa Redonda, or “Round House,” in Palermo Chico has long been a mysterious fixture of one of the most elegant and affluent neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. On the wooden front gate, reliefs of Dante and his muse, Beatrice, guard the entrance to an architectural gem that sat empty for eight years. This rounded residence was designed by Mario Palanti, the renowned Italian architect behind the city’s famous Barolo Palace. As a sign on the house indicates, Palanti designed the Casa Redonda together with architect Marcos Algier, in the 1920s. The unique structure fuses together various architectural styles, ringed by Art Deco arches and crowned with an ornate tower. You enter the building through a rounded hall and a beautiful wooden staircase with bronze details, flanked by street lamps from another era. On the upper level, you can look down on one of the most elegant avenues in Buenos Aires. The Palermo Chico (aka Barrio Parque) neighborhood is home to millionaires, politicians, and celebrities, and is lined with a number of embassies, lavish houses, and penthouse buildings showing off an eclectic mix of architectural styles. The streets of this exclusive pocket of the city are not very crowded and are paved with the beautiful purple and blue colors of the flowering local jacarandá tree. Though little is known about the Palanti Round House, it’s believed it was built for the wealthy Fevre family, who represented Chrysler in Argentina. Starting in 1980, the building housed the Embassy of Iran, before being closed and abandoned for nearly a decade. The Casa Redonda was recently restored by the company Argentina Mobili and now serves as a luxury furniture showroom and a contemporary art gallery.  The house is near the Latin American Art Museum of Buenos Aires (MALBA), across from the Haiti Embassy, in front of the former Renault Museum (now a luxury apartment complex). The showroom and gallery are open to visitors every day from 10 a.m. to 7 a.m.",mystery design houses homes abandoned history architecture

Stripes and squiggles cover the facades, the pops of primary colors adding a wonderfully electric atmosphere to the neighborhood. The bright array of public art is the work of local artist Marino Santa María. During the spring of 2001, he worked with his neighbors to transform three blocks into a colorful display of public art. Now, 34 houses spanning three blocks boast vivid mosaics. Walking the narrow, winding streets reveals humble homes decorated with unique works of art, forming what’s essentially an open-air gallery that still bustles with day-to-day city life. Each abode maintains its own identity, and some homeowners even cleaned up the areas around their houses to highlight the art. The artist worked with his neighbors to design mosaics that fit both his aesthetics and their own, tailoring each design to fit that of each individual houses.  You can walk around the area at any time. The artist still lives there, and you can usually get in touch with him to arrange a quick meeting or even a tour of his work.",mosaics public art roadside attractions houses homes art
38,Tierra Santa,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Bible stories are brought to life with gloriously cartoonish kitsch in this South American theme park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tierra-santa,"Holy bible stories are usually presented with the weighty gravitas of the sacrifice at their core, however at the Tierra Santa theme park in Buenos Aires old Jerusalem is brought to life with lively shows, kitschy tableaus and a 40-foot Jesus. The sprawling park has been constructed to look like Biblical Jerusalem in fiberglass and stucco. Inside and outside of the faux primitive huts over 500 plastic Romans, Jesuits, and other era-appropriate figures bring the world to static life posed as merchants, loiterers, worshippers, and famous biblical figures. Visitors can take part in recreations of such famous events as the last supper, where diners can eat next to mannequins of the apostles and snap a pic next to Judas, or experience the book of Genesis with animatronic lions and hippos. The main attraction at the park is the hourly appearance of the 40-foot Jesus statue that rises up from within a skull-covered Golgotha while Handel’s Messiah blasts from the speakers. The massive savior wiggles his stigmata and closes his eyes in a state of grace before lowering back down into the mountain. In addition to all of the statues and robots, the staff is uniformed in Bible-era clothing (although their attitudes are thoroughly modern), completing the feel of being transported to a sensational Jerusalem that is more haunted house than holy house. Tierra Santa claims to be the first religious theme park in the world, and while that may not be true, it is certainly singular in its devotion to the uncanny valley. Tierra Santa

Here, the town’s forefathers who lost their lives to pestilence have lain for nearly a century and a half, their story all but forgotten. Completed in 1873, the South Cemetery (as some call it) was established to handle an exponential increase in deaths associated with successive outbreaks of yellow fever and cholera from the years 1869 and 1871. Prior to its creation, the town had had no collective cemetery in which to inter its deceased; in the face of such epidemics, San Andres de Giles’ bodies began stacking up too quickly for the old ways to prevail. Within the decade, however, the tide of doom receded, leaving this particular cemetery unneeded. Since that day, the cemetery has been abandoned, with no one to tend its graves after the first generation of descendants passed away. During the interim, the surrounding field fell into disrepair, and reseeded itself with an eerie crop of wildflowers that rise fresh among the dead each year. That said, recent reports tell of weeding and a modicum of maintenance arriving at the abandoned cemetery in recent years. Nonetheless, San Andres de Giles’ lonely, nameless dead are best visited from afar due to a perimeter fence (which would require hopping) keeping visitors — well-intentioned and otherwise — at a distance of a few feet from the remaining crypts.",catacombs and crypts graveyards cemeteries abandoned

Ten years later he opened a “multifaceted museum” dedicated to mankind and its works. He started out with a small display in an old property inherited from his family but now he has expanded his collection to include near 23,000 pieces. Mr. Bouchon was born in Niza (France) in 1928 and he claims to have been a keen collector since childhood. Now, at age 87, he owns the biggest and most interesting private collection of archeological and anthropological pieces in Argentina, which includes everything from mineral samples and animal skeletons, to pieces of aboriginal art, all sorts of antiques, male and female clothing from all ages, cutlery, art, toys, crystals, weapons, music instruments, and “every single piece of machinery ever made by men.” The whole collection is arranged by theme. There are eight different rooms and you might find lots of small treasures and also some bizarre displays, like the two-headed cow or the human skulls. Every single room is completely filled with magical pieces right up to the ceiling so the list of wonders is nearly endless. The owner loves every single piece in his sprawling collection, and he can tell you what it is, where it came from and who invented it. Bouchon studied Anthropology and Arts in Paris, and he claims to be “self taught” in Natural Science, amongst other things. The front door is guarded by 49 handmade statues (“because 7 x 7 equals 49,” he explains) of the most prominent people from all over the world. The list includes Leonardo Da Vinci, Saint John The Baptist, Johannes Gutenberg, Saint Francis, and Mahatma Ghandi. “All of them have one thing in common: they’ve all made a big contribution to mankind, they were all pacifists and above all, they were humanists.” The Rocsen Museum has an internet site, but to be fair it doesn’t do any justice to the actual museum. The exhibit shows about 23,000 different pieces and the number keeps growing every day thanks to people’s donations and Bouchon’s eagerness to “complete” his collection. Bouchon is also an active member of the International Council of Museums (I.C.O.M.) and head of the Buenos Aires Society of Anthropology and Medical History.

Regardless of conclusions, we have always devised ways to leave this world in style. Ancient Egyptians traveled to the afterlife in elaborate funerary boats. Major companies now offer the option of space burials. Fernando Aguerre came face-to-face with an elegant form of post-mortem transportation when he discovered a pair of magnificent wood-carved funeral Cadillacs while exploring an antique barn in Argentina. These hand-crafted funeral cars originated as 1942 Cadillac Fleetwood Series 60 Special four-door sedans, each with a 133-inch wheelbase. They were converted into a flower car and hearse, possibly inspired by two horse-drawn carriages that were found nearby. Each car is adorned with a hand-carved wood body with intricate swirl and wave patterns.  A metal plaque affixed to one of the cars bears the name of an Argentine coachbuilder, “Hermida y Nazzi.” The origins of the cars and their maker remain unknown, however since Aguerre’s discovery another ornate hearse made by this coachbuilder has surfaced on eBay. Aguerre, a native Argentine who is now a resident of California, is in the process of restoring the cars, and looking for a place to display them. The flower car was completed in Nov. 2010.

The crater field of Campo del Cielo is comprised of at least 26 meteorite craters, created by impacts estimated to be 4,000-5,000 years old. The site was first reported in 1576, when the local governor went looking for the reported huge piece of iron that fell from the sky in the place locals referred to as Campo del Cielo, or “Field of the Sky”.

Rojas wrote poems, essays, and plays, and was also a great promoter of education and intellect. While a professor at the University of Buenos Aires, he created the first syllabus for a class on Argentine literature which, until then, was only a marginal topic in a broader genre of Spanish literature. Rojas was interested in the constant interaction between Europe and Latin America, particularly Latin American’s efforts to combine a European influence with their indigenous selves in a search for a sense of native identity. The house where he lived is the work of Ángel Guido, who gave shape to what Rojas called euríndico, a term for this conception of culture as a melting pot for European and Latin American societies.

Yet reminders of many of these troubled periods can be found together in one small public park filled with statues commemorating the passage of Argentine history here, at the “southernmost city in the world.” The first of three memorials depicts the darkest stage of the Patagonian town’s history. Named “Ona en acecho,” or “The Stalking Ona,” it portrays a figure kneeling on a rock, and was intended as an homage to the Indigenous tribes that founded the former village that would become modern Ushuaia. Erected in 1984, the statue was commissioned to mark the centennial of the city’s founding. Though commemorating a landmark birthday for the town, the stand atop which the figure is perched appears to be suffering from a lack of care. Located just behind Ona sits an entire building dedicated to local handicraft inspired by ancient indigenous culture and artisans. Its official name is “El paseo de los artesanos,” or “The Passage of the Artisans.” Wandering its halls, visitors are invited to peruse the works and wares of local peoples. Most everything contained therein is available for purchase. Immediately to the rear of this indoor market sits what can only be described as a massive concrete pyramid. Since its burial in 1992, this has been the location of the Time Capsule of Ushuaia. The Capsule consists of a hermetically-sealed container packed with six laser discs of television shows from the 1990s and hundreds of written messages collected from all corners of Argentina. These messages are each addressed to the people of Ushuaia, and dated 2492—1,000 years after Christopher Columbus’s arrival in America. Inscribed on the Time Capsule’s headstone it contains no mention of the former indigenous tribes that can no longer be found on the continent by the ancestors of modern-day Argentina. However, these words do appear in bold: “The content of the Time Capsule was created to show parts of our present ways of thinking.” This, rather unfortunately, seems a fair statement.

The one in Parque Rivadavia is amongst the oldest and largest, and also quite off the beaten tourist track. Open since 1953, this large book market sells and trades used and new books, records, and comics. Patient browsing of their usually dusty boxes can yield both bestsellers and lost gems, rarities, and antiques. Since every metal kiosk is operated by a different independent bookseller, you can hardly ever find them all open at the same time. Also, booksellers have very different criteria and profiles, and usually specialize in some specific kind of titles: there’s the kiosk that sells mostly titles in languages other than Spanish, the one that sells a lot of humanities and philosophy, the one that sells schoolbooks, the one that trades comic books, the one that sells only old rarities. There are many shelves on which you can guess the bookseller’s personal taste, or even vintage records and some video games. This also makes every trip to Parque Rivadavia Book Market a unique experience. Bear in mind that, although you can find some books in languages other than Spanish, this market caters mostly to local readers.

Stretching for 2/3 of a mile, the multi-colored instrument was created by one Argentine farmer to memorialize his wife who tragically died at the age of 25. After flying over fields in the Pampas that resembled a milk pail, Pedro Ureta’s wife Graciela suggested they embed a design into their own fields. Ureta never really had time to think about turning his field into a giant work of art, and told her they would put the project off until they both had more time. In 1977, Graciela unexpectedly died from a brain aneurysm, and her dream was lost forever. Crushed by the loss of his love, a few years later Ureta began working on designing a guitar in his field that could be seen from above by airplane. He settled on the design because his late wife loved the instrument and he wanted to memorialize her on his land. Working tirelessly to plant and cultivate the trees, Ureta created a perfect guitar shape, complete with a star-shaped hole in the middle. Using mostly cypress trees to form the outline, Ureta used blue eucalyptus trees to accent the strings on the neck of the guitar. Easily visible from airplanes, the guitar brings joy to many who fly over the Pampas. Ureta himself is afraid of flying and has only seen the guitar he created to remember his companion, Graciela, in photos.",outsider art plants

Carlos Guido Spano, an acclaimed Argentinean poet, built this tomb for his father, General Tomás Guido. General Guido was a close friend of famed General José de San Martín, and had served with him during the War of Independence. Together they crossed the Cordillera de los Andes, an extremely perilous quest, and were able to combat the Spanish armies and help free Chile and Perú. When he returned, General Tomás Guido served as a diplomat in Argentina. He requested to be buried under the mountains that his troops had crossed with great sacrifice to liberate their neighbor countries. His son, Carlos, fulfilled his wishes. The younger Guido had all the rocks for the tomb brought from the Cordillera de los Andes and built the vault with his own hands. Carlos gave the tomb the form of a simple grotto, decorated with marbles, sculptures, and tainted glass, contrasting greatly with the surrounding grave sites around it. Carlos also dedicated a poem to the memory of his father, inscribed on a bronze plaque on the side of the tomb. Upon his own death in 1918, he was also interred at Recoleta Cemetery. In 1966, General Guido’s remains were moved to the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral, and he rests next to his great friend and general, José de San Martín. The son, Carlos, still lies at the original tomb.  The hand-built tomb lies in the middle of the Cemetery of Recoleta, in memory of Gen. Tomás Guido, however the general's remains were moved to the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral.

54,Villa Freud,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",A pocket of Buenos Aires with an unusually high concentration of psychotherapists.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/villa-freud,"Argentina is known for (among many other things) being the country with the most psychologists per capita in the world. This unusually high concentration of therapists is highest in its capital city, where there is such an abundance of therapists in one particular pocket of Buenos Aires the area has earned the nickname Villa Freud. Located near the beautiful Plaza Güemes, Villa Freud, also known as Guadalupe, is a micro-neighborhood within Palermo, the largest neighborhood in Buenos Aires. Aside from having an extremely high number of therapists’ offices in the area, analysis has seeped into the culture in Villa Freud. Local bookstores and newspapers regularly offer plenty of reading material on the subject, and you can find Freud-themed cafes and bars. Though a range of psychology disciplines like cognitive and behavioral therapy are also practiced, Argentinians remain partial to psychoanalysis, the method invented by Sigmund Freud. There are various theories as to why the practice took such strong hold in the country. Some point to the fact that it’s an introspective and open culture, and doesn’t stigmatize mental health in the same way as other parts of the world. The therapy boom began in the 1940s, when a Spanish immigrant named Angel Garma, who had studied psychoanalysis with people who had studied with Freud himself, came to Argentina to investigate the death of his father. He brought his education with him, and it started to spread. Recent estimates suggest that, today, there are nearly 200 practicing psychologists in Argentina for every 100,000 people, and nearly half of them are based in Buenos Aires.",psychology psychiatry health
55,La Piedra Movediza (Shifting Stone),"Tandil, Argentina","A replica of a beloved, delicately-balanced granite boulder.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-piedra-movediza,"For years, a 300-ton granite boulder balanced atop a hill overlooking the town of Tandil in eastern Argentina. La Piedra Movediza (“the shifting stone”) was a popular tourist attraction in the early 20th century. Decades after the beloved boulder fell from its hilltop, a replica was installed in its place. The stone was a fount of municipal pride, and served as the official city symbol of Tandil. People pantomimed holding up its prodigious weight while having their pictures taken. Bottles were placed under the boulder and broken as it teetered slowly on its fulcrum. In 1900, some traveling circus performers did acrobatics on its crest. But in 1912, the rock shifted for the last time and tumbled off the hill. No witnesses were present, and debates about how it fell persist to this day. The original stone can still be seen, lying broken at the foot of its former home. The people of Tandil have built a castle, archway, and a cliff-hugging auditorium in honor of their city’s symbol. In 2007, the town commissioned a replica of the rock, made of a metal framework covered in resin and synthetic fibers—sans the 19th-century graffiti that covered the original. The replica was affixed to the hill with a dozen strong bolts. Along the short hike to the replica stone, interpretive panels explain the history of the stone. One describes  the replica’s secure attachment to its base, and how it shall never fall by the forces of God or man. The views of the town from the hilltop are impressive, but the effusiveness of the town’s pride is reason enough to visit.

56,Rueda Eiffel,"Córdoba, Argentina",An intriguing antique iron Ferris wheel that most locals are sure was designed by Gustave Eiffel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rueda-eiffel,"Gustave Eiffel is connected with tens if not hundreds of constructions across South America, some legitimately and others more dubiously. Whether the celebrated French engineer and architect had any hand in the design of the Rueda Eiffel in Córdoba, Argentina, is still open to debate. The Rueda Eiffel (Eiffel Wheel), also known as the Vuelta al Mundo de Córdoba, is a large iron Ferris wheel in Parque Sarmiento in Córdoba, the second largest city in Argentina. But its original location, as far as anyone knows, was 325 miles north in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán in the north of Argentina. How it got there is anyone’s guess. What we do know is that it was erected in the old Mundial Park in Tucumán in the early 1900s, at which time it was known as the Rueda Monumental (Monumental Wheel). In 1918, the wheel was purchased on some long-forgotten whim by the city of Córdoba, where it was reassembled in Parque Sarmiento. And that’s where the 88.5-foot diameter wheel still stands today, although only just. Just one year after buying the wheel, the local municipality had to fork out a significant slice of cash to stop the wheel from collapsing. Back then, actual passengers where allowed on the wheel, making its structural deficiencies an issue of some urgency. Patched up, it was reopened to the public and then closed again in 1926. It reopened, then closed again in 1938, when its supporting spokes were so weakened that the wheel had taken on an oval shape. Local engineers removed 10 of the wheel’s 20 cabins to decrease the load. It remained that way until 1992, when engineers finally agreed that the whole thing was actually, honestly, yes really, collapsing, at which point the Rueda Eiffel was closed until further notice. It wasn’t until 2001 that the Rueda Eiffel began to see some hope of a return to dignity. The municipality invested $150,000 USD into its reconstruction and renovation, and the wheel was re-inaugurated in 2003. It didn’t spin and certainly couldn’t carry any passengers, but the wheel was nonetheless restored to a proud aesthetic state as a sculpture. It now stands once again as an iconic landmark of Córdoba. As for the Eiffel connection, the architect and historian Carlos Page argues that the wheel was indeed designed by the Frenchman. According to Page, the structure once bore a metal plaque stating just that. The plaque, however, was apparently removed and lost, and with it any potentially concrete connection to Gustave Eiffel.",monuments sculptures architectural oddities architecture
57,Sanctuaries of Difunta Correa,"Caucete, Argentina",Trash-filled shrines to an unofficial saint known for her endless breast milk dot the highways of Argentina.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sanctuaries-of-difunta-correa,"Drivers on the highways and backroads of the San Juan region of Argentina are protected by the grace of folk saint Difunta Correa, whose crude roadside shrines are surrounded by everything from piles of water bottles to toy cars, asking for remarkably specific types of grace from the holy woman’s endless teat. According to legend, Deolinda Correa was a soldier’s wife who, in the first half of the 19th century, set out to find her sick husband who had been abandoned by his unit. Carrying her newborn child, Correa set out into the desert to track down her love, but tragically Correa soon ran out of water and supplies and perished in the harsh San Juan climate. As the story goes, when cattle drivers found the woman days later, she was deceased, but her newborn baby was still suckling from Correa’s seemingly fathomless breast. In death, the miraculous woman was renamed Difunta Correa (deceased Correa) and she was buried atop a hill in what is now known as the town of Vallecito. Originally the grave was marked with a simple cross but as word of the wondrous woman spread, worshippers began leaving effigies of specific blessings they were requesting and soon a shrine was erected over the gravesite with a life-size statue of the Difunta Correa, complete with child still at her breast. As the years passed and her cult of believers grew, more and more small shrines were built surrounding the hill, each with a specific theme. One of the shrines is surrounded by hundreds of small, hand-crafted houses asking that the saint bless their home with abundance, while another is surrounded by wedding dresses left there by women wishing for blessings in love. Car registrations and, more than anything else, empty water bottles are also popular offerings, the empty water bottles signifying a replenishment of the holy breast milk. While the largest concentration of these sanctuaries are located in Vallecito (the town actually sprung up thanks to the popularity of the shrine), Difunta Correa has developed a reputation as a patron saint of travelers and small shrines to her grace can be seen dotting the highways all across Argentina. Difunta Correa is not recognized by the Catholic church as an official saint, but you would never be able to tell by her countless sanctuaries. Head for Vallecito over Route 141 coming from San Juan and you'll won't miss it.",shrines saints
58,"Casa de Botellas ""La Fortaleza""","Quilmes, Argentina",An artist's statement of new uses for ordinary and discarded materials.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-de-botellas-la-fortaleza,"South of the Argentine capital city of Buenos Aires lies Quilmes, a coastal town known best as the home of Argentina’s national beer, Rubén “Tito” Ingenieri, works away, a self-described “laborer of art.” Ingenieri lives a ten-minute cab ride away from the city center in a self constructed house with walls made almost entirely of salvaged bottles. A professional artist and teacher at the local high school, Ingenieri has spent the better part of two decades building the home, which consists of a small main house with a working kitchen and bathroom, a workshop and storage area, and walls that line the property. An additional three-story tower in the center of the backyard remains a work in progress—although presently a wall-less iron structure with wood planks for floors, Ingenieri has plans to one day turn it into a lighthouse. One imagines that the hundreds of bottles piled throughout the front and back yards (some sorted by color, others mixed in with other salvage in seemingly random mounds) will one day end up as a part of this new project. Ingenieri says he has thousands more stored off-site, many of them collected by and given to him by the town’s municipal government, as well as by neighbors and friends. Ingenieri’s collections fill the main home’s interior—bicycles, masks, eyeglasses—either as standalone objects or re-purposed into sculpture. The low ceilings and few windows give a cave like feel to the space, which Ingenieri has filled with handmade tables and chairs that rest on an attractively uneven wooden floor. A curtain made from long film negatives covers the entrance to the small bedroom, and the walls made of glass bottle and the cement that holds them in place create a uniquely dim, multi-colored light. A large wooden door, the only one in the house’s interior, separates the bathroom from the main area, where Ingenieri keeps his stacks of CDs (mostly 60s psychedelia—the artist has a particular fondness for Jimi Hendrix) and art made by him or given to him by friends and admirers. In a box by the stereo, Ingenieri keeps a violin he made out of a tin of kerosene. He doesn’t know how to play, he claims, but enjoys trying to keep up with the music he listens to nonetheless. The short and jovial Ingenieri identifies the science-fiction comic El Eternauta - written in the late 1950’s by Argentine Héctor Oesterheld - as one of his greatest influences. This fact comes as no surprise to the visitor, given the dozens of images throughout the home and yard of the comic’s main character, Juan Salvo, wearing his characteristic scuba mask. A painted, wooden sign propped up against a pillar on the tower’s ground floor (currently occupied by Ingenieri’s welding machine and used as an outdoor workspace) advertises a theater devoted to the work of Antonin Artaud, another of Ingenieri’s great influences. Not yet built, the artist has plans to move onto the theater’s construction once he has finished with central tower. Ingenieri hopes that all of his projects communicate a new perspective among viewers of available materials and their uses, and encourages others to adopt his building style.

Close to the train station, far from the city—in a place called Santos Lugares—the house Sábato worked served as a retreat where he wrote most of his work and devoted himself to his other passion, painting. Built by film director and pioneer, Federico Valle in 1927 as a film study, the glass panel room served as the writing study for Sábato for many years. A few years before the family acquired the house, another famous writer occupied it, Jorge Amado who was a famous Brazilian writer, exiled at the time. His personal library is on display in the greenhouse and there’s film footage—produced by his son, Mario Sábato—of the family’s everyday life. The house was the meeting point of great artists and politicians: Antonio Berni and Leopoldo Marechal, among others. Today, Sábato’s old haunt is open to the public and offers guided tours, allowing for aspiring writers and bookworms to retrace the footsteps of their favorite authors.

60,Azul Cemetery Entrance,"Azul, Argentina",This colossal structure and its accompanying angel often play tricks on the eyes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/azul-cemetery-entrance,"The Azul Municipal Cemetery entrance is one of more than 60 public works Italian-Argentine architect Francisco Salamone built between 1936 and 1940. At nearly 70 feet high (21 meters) and over 140 feet wide (43 meters), the structure towers over visitors. At the front stands an angel, wielding his sword and casting a furrowed brow upon onlookers. The Cubist sculpture is marked by dramatic, distorted facial contours that play tricks on the eyes, depending on the angle and light. Rumor has it that when the entrance was constructed, the citizens had concerns over its cost and swore that RIP stood for “Resulta Imposible de Pagar,” or “Turns Out It’s Impossible to Pay For.” Salamone’s works include mainly town halls, cemetery entrances, and slaughterhouses in small frontier towns in the rural grasslands of Argentina. His architecture was a combination of many styles including Art Deco and Italian Futurism. Built in concrete, the structures often loom over these small towns, seen as propaganda works that reinforce municipal power and authority.  Azul was declared Argentina's ""City of Cervantes"" by UNESCO in 2007 and maintains some impressive Don Quixote collections, as well as six other Salamone structures.

José de San Martín is regarded as one of the fathers of Argentina and liberators of South America, having led the fight against the Spanish to gain the independence of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. San Martín was born in Yapeyú and completed his military studies in Spain, where he fought against Napoleon. When he returned to Argentina he founded the Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo and commanded the army in the north. He organized the army of Los Andes and arranged what seemed an impossible task: to cross the Cordilleras de Los Andes—one of the biggest mountain chains in the world with very hard conditions—into Chile and fight the Spanish army there. He then headed to Lima to declare the independence of Perú in 1821 and joined Simón Bolívar in the famous Interview of Guayaquil. Later in his life, due to the political situation of the country, the Granaderos were disbanded and relocated to other forces. San Martín was forced to exile to France, where he died. Years later his body was taken back to Argentina and put to rest in the Cathedral of Buenos Aires in 1880. Only seven of the original Granaderos were still alive. They dressed in their old uniforms and decided to march to the port to receive their general’s body and escort him to his final resting place. They mounted guard the whole night and the following morning, they left and disappeared. Some years later, the Regimiento de Granaderos was formed again. A group of seven Granaderos can be seen every morning marching from Casa Rosada (the presidential office) to the cathedral, and two of them remain on guard during the whole day in front of San Martín’s memorial. The beautiful monument consists of three female figures, representing the countries that San Martín helped to liberate. Around the tomb lie the remains of two of his generals and good friends, Tomás Guido and Juan Las Heras, as well as the tomb of the unknown soldier.  The Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral is open every day until quite late. But since it's located in the heart of the city and is very busy during the week, the best is to visit during the weekends.",tombs burial places war history memorials churches military sacred spaces history

What began with the founding of the School of the Immaculate Conception at St. Joseph’s Oratory, expanded into a set of replicas encompassing some of the world’s holiest sites for Christians. The most famous of these features is Lourdes’ Grotto, set in an old stone quarry near the grounds at St. Joseph’s. Surrounded by thick vegetation, the shrine began in 1937 when the land was donated by Dr. Norberto F. Peralta Ramos. Set amongst a recessed cave of limestone, an image of the Virgin of Our Lady of Lourdes presides over a series of plaques and offerings left in thanks to the Virgin for her aid. Farther up the hill on the same grounds as the shrine, scale replicas of both Bethlehem and Jerusalem can be found. Noted for its peaceful energy, Lourdes’ Grotto in Mar de Plata’s was designed by architect Luis Cossa to replicate as closely as possible the site of one of the world’s most famed Marian apparitions; in February of 1858 in the cave of Massabielle just outside the town of Lourdes, France, Bernadette Soubirous reported being spoken to by the Blessed Virgin Mary while gathering firewood.",miniature towns grottoes saints

The vast deposits of the precious metal never materialized, but the name stuck. However, in Uspallata exist a rare example of mining activity that did occur in the region. Bóvedas is the Spanish word for vaults. However, the primary function of this site was to act as a smelter. Metallic ore from the nearby mines of Paramillos was crushed and smelted into ingots. The egg-shaped domes acted as charcoal furnaces used to heat and melt the ore. This operation was constructed by Jesuits in the late 1700s, but there is some evidence of such activities taking place at this location during the pre-Colombian period. High in the Andes Mountains, Uspallata is a strategic location on the road to Chile. General San Martín passed through the area on his way to liberate Chile from Spanish rule in 1817. It is rumored that the buildings of Las Bóvedas served as the headquarters and warehouses for the Army of the Andes as they planned their attack. It’s even been suggested that the foundries were used to create the cannons used in his operations. There is little evidence proving San Martín ever used the buildings. But during the 1920s, just the possibility that it may have occurred was enough to spark interest in preserving the site. In addition to displays of the facility’s metallurgic history, the small museum also showcases some history of the 1817 campaign to liberate Chile.",silver war history military history & culture museums architecture

He called upon his brother, famed architect Alejandro Bustillo, to design a resort to attract wealthy tourists to the area. First opened in 1939, Llao Llao Resort was built in the style of the great Canadian lodges. Five thousand trees were cleared to build the resort. Soon after its completion, the building burned to the ground but was quickly rebuilt and reopened in 1940. Following the outbreak of World War II, the hotel housed many wealthy patrons looking to escape the fighting in Europe. Although the resort hosted many high-profiled guests, it eventually saw a decline in revenues and was forced to close in 1976. The building fell into disrepair for over a decade. In 1991, ownership of the resort was privatized and the hotel was reopened in 1993.",hotels world war ii parks architecture

At first glance, it appears to be a giant race car. In fact, it is a car-shaped house built to resemble the classic Ford that Argentinian racer Héctor Arcadio Ninona was driving when he won fifth place in the 1958 Grand Prix. The race car residence was built by Ninona’s proud father, an enthusiastic racing fan himself, who came up with this truly original way to honor his son’s achievements in Turismo Carretera (Road Touring), a racing series that’s been around since 1937 and is very popular in Argentina. Constructing the Casa Auto (Auto House), as it’s come to be known, was no easy feat. Working with the help of a builder with just a yellowing old photograph to go off of, Ninona spent months laboring in 18-hour shifts to fashion the automobile abode out of iron and cement. The project was finally completed in 1981, and in July of 2017 it was named a national historic monument. The house is still owned by the Ninonas today and is used, fittingly, as a venue for family reunions.  The house is easily visible as it's situated on the side of a major national road, Ruta Nacional 8, at the intersection of General Alvear in Pergamino.",races cars sports eccentric homes houses homes architectural oddities architecture

Aconcagua is the tallest peak in the Americas. Nestled high in the Andes near the border of Argentina and Chile, it’s the highest mountain anywhere outside of Asia. To mountaineers, it’s not a very technical trek, in that it doesn’t require any specialized equipment to reach the summit. However, the hike can be deceptively dangerous for those who are unprepared. As a stark reminder of that fact, this cemetery is the final resting place for many who have attempted to reach the summit. At least 150 people have died attempting the ascent, but not all who perished are buried in the cemetery.

67,Plaza Primero de Mayo,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",You have to know where to look in this rather ordinary-looking square to find hints of its past as a dissidents' cemetery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plaza-primera-de-mayo-dissidents-cemetery,"Upon a quick first glance, Plaza Primero de Mayo looks like any other small square in Buenos Aires. There are games for children, a traditional carrousel, a bocce court, a small soccer area, some chess tables, trees, bushes, and benches. If you go there on a  Saturday, you may find the kiosks of a wet market selling things like fish, vegetables, and cheese. But only a careful inspection of the old fence that separates the square from some 80s residential projects on its western border and a faded memorial plaque are there to offer a hint of the plaza’s past. In 1833, when this area was still the town’s borders, this plot of land was designated as a dissident cemetery, a place for the non-Catholic to bury their dead. It used to feature a small building for religious services of diverse creeds, and housed tombs mostly of Protestant and Jewish families. It functioned as such until 1891. In 1892, tombs began to be moved towards other new burial sites, like the German and the English sectors of the Cementerio de la Chacarita, which is still in use to this day. The chapel was demolished in 1915, and by 1923 the relocation process was considered finished. It was decided that the place would become a public square, and in 1925 it was finally inaugurated as Plaza Primero de Mayo, (May 1st Square), dedicated to celebrating workers. An award-winning sculpture of a nude worker with a large hammer was put in place, which still greets you if you enter through Pasco. But there’s a catch. Since the tombs were relocated on demand, only the dead who still had living relatives to speak for them were actually moved to new cemeteries. As for the rest? Well, most of them are still there. Some tombstones were removed, while others were just scattered and covered with dirt. As late as 2006, when the square was last thoroughly remodeled, workers digging to build a new children’s games area found a marble tombstone for a 10-month-old German girl who died in 1886. Work was halted, and an archaeological digging of the site rendered the bones of children and adults, along with several other artifacts such as coffin handles and glass shards. It was said there would be a larger dig in the square and some sort of museum would be opened, but that never happened: instead, the games for children were eventually installed as planned, and most of the grounds remained untouched, with only a plaque to remind very curious and attentive minds that when you cross Plaza Primero de Mayo, you may be walking on somebody else’s grave.",urban parks catholic burial places archaeology cemeteries
68,Shrine to Gauchito Gil,"Mendoza, Argentina",This roadside memorial pays homage to Argentina's Outlaw Saint.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gauchito-gil-shrine,"Roadside shrines are a cultural phenomenon across Argentina. Originally created by gauchos and now truck drivers, these tributes dot the countryside. Most honor Difunta Correa with offerings of bottled water. Monuments erected to Gauchito Gil stand out as they are festooned with red ribbons and flags. Antonio Mamerto Gil Núñez, a soldier-turned-outlaw, is regarded as a folk hero in Argentina. Like Robin Hood, he sought to help and protect the poor. A gaucho is an Argentinian cowboy. In Spanish the suffix -ito is a term of endearment, meaning little. Legend has it that their “little cowboy” performed miracles and was even bulletproof. Even after his capture and execution in 1878, it’s said Gil still performed miracles. Gil is not recognized as a saint by the Catholic church, but for the faithful, these roadside shrines are a place to give thanks to the Gauchito for the blessings he has bestowed. High in the Andes, National Route 7 is a narrow two-lane highway connecting Argentina and Chile. Being an international route, there is a significant amount of truck traffic along the road. Inclement weather, blind corners, and steep drop-offs can make driving this road a harrowing and dangerous experience. This particular shrine is located where the mountainous route connects to the safety of the valley floor. It’s safe to assume that many truck drivers and motorists have stopped here to give thanks to Gauchito Gil for safe passage through the Andes. Though there are many small shrines to Gauchito Gil across Argentina, he was laid-to-rest in the city of Mercedes in northeastern Argentina. Every year, more than 200,000 people make a pilgrimage to the gravesite. The Festival of Gauchito Gil is held on January 8th.",shrines saints history & culture
69,Cabildo de Córdoba,"Córdoba, Argentina",One of the oldest colonial buildings still standing in South America.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cabildo-de-cordoba,"The term cabildo can be translated as “chapter,” but in colonial times it referred specifically to the town hall. To learn about the Cabildo de Córdoba means to delve into the colonial history of Argentina. Córdoba, founded in 1573 by Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera, was one of the first colonial centers that Spain established in South America. The settlement’s earliest years of existence were marred by clashes between the Indigenous Comechingones and the Spanish, making Córdoba for all intents and purposes a military outpost. A few years after it was established, Don Lorenzo Suárez de Figueroa designed the urban grid around which the city of Córdoba developed. In 1588 construction began on a building that would function as the local cabildo. Like many other buildings at that time, the first incarnation consisted of mud walls and a thatched roof. It was given the name Cabildo de Justicia y Regimiento de Córdoba, and inside the colonizers dealt with a wide array of issues including governance, legislation, economy, education, health, and security. The inadequacy of the structure became soon apparent, and expansion and upgrade work started in 1606. This project lasted four years because of a delay caused by the arrest of the only bricklayer in Córdoba, who was eventually released to ensure the completion of the work. In 1857, when a new structure was built to accommodate all the offices necessary for the administration of the city, the Cabildo de Córdoba was repurposed to house the provincial police headquarters. Its final reincarnation occurred in 1989, when the police relocated, and the Cabildo became a cultural center, with the Museum of Córdoba inside. Nowadays, the Cabildo de Córdoba is an important historical building located in Plaza San Martin, easily recognizable for its colonial architecture and elegant 15-arch passageway.",government colonialism architecture
70,El Bosque Tallado,"El Bolsón, Argentina",This mountainside open-air museum was built from the ashes left behind by a devastating fire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-bosque-tallado,"On the slopes of Mount Piltriquitrón, above the Patagonian paradise city of El Bolsón, lies the curious forest known as el Bosque Tallado, or the Carved Forest in English. The park was opened in 1998 by the Argentinian artist Marcelo Lopez. The pre-cordillera mountains are known for their falling rocks, and the dry climate of the region makes it prone to fires. This combination shapes forests all around, and Cerro Piltriquitrón is no exception: fallen, dry, and even burned trees can be found everywhere. After a massive forest fire in the 1980s, there were even more burned logs dotting the mountainside. Here comes the genius of this open-air museum: it gives a second life to fallen trees by carving them into beautiful wooden sculptures. When the initiative began, a group of artists came together and produced the first 13 sculptures in a little more than a week. In the years since, artists from all over the world have been invited to take a part in this initiative, creating a total of more than 60 pieces to be enjoyed.  The closest parking spot is situated a few kilometers above El Bolsón, meaning you have to drive on a dirt mountain road upwards for some time. Afterwards, a 45-minute relatively accessible mountain hike is also necessary to reach the entrance of the park. In January 2023, the entrance fee was 1000 pesos.

But it’s more than meets the eye. There, obscured by dense trees, lie the ruins of an energetic past involving secret nuclear experiments and Nazi scientists. In 1949, president Juan Perón personally invited Ronald Richter, an Austrian scientist famous for developing a particle accelerator for the Nazis, to Argentina to work on fusion energy. Richter was given carte blanche and hundreds of millions of pesos, as well as the entirety of Huemul Island, to pursue his work. But after initial claims of success, the work was revealed to be fraudulent and the project shut down in 1952. Three years later, Perón was overthrown, and Richter was arrested for fraud in the aftermath. The advanced scientific complex was left to rot, eventually being used as target practice for the military. Today, trees and vines are reclaiming the structures once home to cutting-edge nuclear experiments run by the Nazi physicists. Visit the island, and you’ll enjoy its eerie calm and fascinating history, as well as sweeping views of the town and surrounding mountains from Richter’s old office atop the island’s lone hill.

72,Parque el Desafío,"Gaiman, Argentina",A retiree's challenge to build an outdoor wonderland out of trash.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/parque-el-desafio,"The town of Gaiman, Argentina customarily appears in tour guides as a living example of Welsh colonization of the Chubut river valley in the late 19th century. Replete with tea houses, imported poplars, and irrigation channels that weave through the center of town, the visual reminders of this wave of European immigrants remain in this South American town. A couple of blocks from the central plaza and the Welsh flags of the city’s main streets lies a hidden gem called the Parque el Desafío on Calle Almirante Brown. In 1980 the park’s creator, then recently retired Joaquín Alonso, began construction of the outdoor gardens with the intent of entertaining his grandchildren. It grew into a giant outdoor space made entirely of recycled trash and found objects, which Alonso opened to the public in 1984 and continued to augment with almost daily work until his death in 2009 at 90 years old. The sculptural installations and quotes that line the paths make statements about modern life and current events, recreate foreign locales, and actively endeavor to inspire reflection in the visitor. Flooded for extended periods by the river on whose banks it sits over the park’s three decades of existence, what began as a creative manner by which Alonso could spend his idle time, exists now as an outdoor temple dedicated to a good sense of humor, common sense, and living a rich life. Alonso organized the park largely according to the visitor’s experience, as he or she follows the labyrinthine paths lined with sculptural installations dedicated to particular themes like the Falkland Island conflict or miniature models of the Taj Mahal and an Andalusian garden. At nearly ever step of the path, a hanging handmade plaque, made from a piece of scrap wood or the top of an oil can, has a handwritten quote, with sources ranging from Classical philosophers like Epicurus and Seneca to anonymous folkiness. These quotes number in the hundreds, and the park’s current caretakers (Alonso’s daughter and other family members) makes a collection of the quotes available to take as a souvenir. Update January, 2017: Sadly, this park closed and was dismantled in 2012. Other features of the park include a small tower made of glass bottles, intended as a shrine to Alonso’s Celtic-Spanish ancestors, smaller gardens devoted to Chinese philosophy or the traditions of the Tehuelche, the Patagonian region’s most prevalent indigenous group. Alonso most frequently takes aim at modernity itself with a tongue-in-cheek, dark humor, as in the case of old car chassises with taxonomic names next to pictures of dinosaurs, and using frequent plays on words to condemn television, government bureaucracy, and state-sponsored violence.

73,Uyuni Salt Flat,"Daniel Campos, Bolivia",A seemingly endless landscape of pure salt stretches far across Bolivia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salar-de-uyuni-bolivian-salt-flat,"Spreading out over 11,000-sq.-km, Salar de Uyuni is the largest salt flat in the world. An endless sheet of hexagonal tiles (created by the crystalline nature of the salt), dotted with pyramids of salt, Bolivia’s salt flats are a dazzling display of nature’s magic. Despite the desert dryness, freezing night temperatures, and fierce desert sun, this landscape is not devoid of life. Pink flamingos, ancient cacti, and rare hummingbirds all live in the Salar de Uyuni. During the wet season, which is roughly from November to April, the salt desert is transformed into an enormous salt lake, albeit one that is only six to twenty inches deep, traversable by both boat and truck. During this time, the shallow salt lake perfectly mirrors the sky, creating bizarre illusions of infinity. In the middle of this seemingly infinite salty lake is a hotel built entirely out of—naturally—salt. Created from salt bricks held together with salt mortar, the hotel and everything inside it, including the chairs and tables, are made from salt. While the Hotel Playa Blanca has no electricity and little in the way of amenities (its water must be trucked in), it does offer even more important and certainly rarer qualities: utter silence, an all-encompassing austere beauty, and an astonishing view of the night sky. Also worth traveling to are the nearby Laguna Colorada and Laguna Verde. Laguna Colorada is a red-hued lake filled with thousands of pink flamingos, while Laguna Verde is a blue-green salt lake found at the foot of the volcano Licancabur. Its shifting aqua color is caused by copper sediments and microorganisms living within the lake.  Getting there. The logistics and duration of the trip to Salar de Uyuni depend on the departure point. Most tours run from three major locations: 1. Uyuni, Bolivia: The most popular starting point for salt flats tours. Uyuni is a small town packed with travel agencies in Plaza Arce. You can book a tour in advance online or use one of the local options in town. As Uyuni is so close to the flats, day trips are a feasible option. Uyuni is easily reachable by plane from La Paz (1 hour, about $130 round trip) or by bus from La Paz (10-12 hours, $30-40 one way). 2. San Pedro de Atacama, Chile: this option usually means a three-day tour. The agency drives travelers to the Chilean-Bolivian border and hands the tour over to a Bolivian tour operator. 3. Tupiza, Bolivia: This is the most popular starting point to the flats for travelers arriving from Argentina. Tour operators offer four-day tours from Tupiza, with a visit to Salar de Uyuni on the last day.",wonders of salt martian landscapes geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems geology nature

Dozens of vendors line the streets to sell a number of strange and fascinating products and the raw ingredients used in rituals to call on the spirits that populate the Aymara world. Among the many items sold at the market are dried llama fetuses that are said to bring both prosperity and good luck, dried frogs used for Aymara rituals, soapstone figurines, aphrodisiac formulas, owl feathers, dried turtles and snakes, herbs, and folk remedies. Witch doctors in dark hats and dresses wander through the market offering fortune-telling services. The dried llama fetuses are the most prominent product available at the market. These animals are fairly large and are used throughout the country, buried in the foundations of new buildings as an offering to the goddess Pachamama. It is believed that the buried llama fetuses keep construction workers safe, but these are only used by poor Bolivians. Wealthy Bolivians usually sacrifice a living llama to Pachamama.

75,Great Train Graveyard,Bolivia,"On the outskirts of a desert trading village high on the Andean plain, steel giants have been destroyed by salt winds.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-train-graveyard,"It’s a cemetery for trains, for locomotives. And it’s so big that it looks as though all of the trains in South America were moved to Uyuni, Bolivia, to chug their last chug. It’s only about 3 km away from the Uyuni train station. Filled with hollowed out bodies that have completely rusted over and other remains, the “Great Train Graveyard” (also known as Train Cemetery or ‘Cemeterio de Trenes’ in Spanish) can be found on the otherwise deserted outskirts of Uyuni, a small trading region high in the Andean plain. Uyuni has long been known as an important transportation hub in South America and it connects several major cities. In the early 19th century, big plans were made to build an even bigger network of trains out of Uyuni, but the project was abandoned because of a combination of technical difficulties and tension with neighboring countries. The trains and other equipment were left to rust and fade out of memory. There are no restrictions in approaching the trains, so visitors often climb atop or go inside the train cars for taking pictures. Most of the trains that can be found in the Graveyard date back to the early 20th century and were imported from Britain. There are over 100 train cars with unique structure and occasional graffitis. In other places in the world, the mighty steel trains would have held up better. The salt winds that blow over Uyuni, which hosts the world’s largest salt plain, have corroded all of the metal. Without guards or even a fence, these pieces were picked over and vandalized long ago.  Since nearly every single salt flat tour company in town visits the Train graveyard at roughly the same time in the late morning to early afternoon, it can easily get drowned out with crowds of people, ultimately disenchanting the abandoned ambience of the place. It's best to visit in the evening (after 5 pm) or early morning (before 8 am) when the buses full of tourist are long gone/haven't arrived yet. It's in walkable distance from the center of Uyuni or you can take a cab for around 10 bolivianos ( $1,30).",object cemeteries deserts railroads ghost towns trains

The popular resort also had the honor of being both the highest ski resort in the world and home to the world’s highest restaurant. But when the mountain’s glacier melted, it was all but abandoned. The ski resort was opened in the late-1930s, and soon middle- and upper-class residents of nearby La Paz were flocking to its slopes. For seven or eight months of the year, people came to ski and go sledding down the Chacaltaya Glacier, at least until the cold and extreme altitude made them return to lower ground. At 17,519 feet above sea level, the Chacaltaya Ski Resort was higher than the North Base Camp of Mount Everest. For decades it held the record as the world’s highest ski resort, and the resort’s restaurant is still recognized by Guinness as the highest restaurant in the world. But in the 1990s, scientists at the Mount Chacaltaya Laboratory began to make some stark predictions. By 2015, they warned, the Chacaltaya Glacier would be gone. As it turned out, they were being optimistic. By 2009, the 18,000-year-old glacier was completely gone. With the ice and snow melted, the skiers naturally stopped coming. The resort was soon shut down and abandoned, and its ski lifts shut down. Since then, the resort has sat like a freezing ghost town on the bare rocky slopes of Chacaltaya. Today, the only near-permanent residents are two brothers, Adolfo and Samuel Mendoza, who had worked at the resort for decades and who remember when the whole mountain was covered with snow. They look after the refugio (the refuge), a building near the main resort where visitors can still find a hot meal (hence Guinness’ continued recognition of Chacaltaya as home to the world’s highest restaurant). Today, only a few tourists visit this now eerily abandoned mountaintop resort. Snow falls occasionally, sometimes enough to ski, but most people come to see the abandoned resort and to take in the views from the top of Chacaltaya, which include impressive vistas of Huayna Potosi, La Paz and El Alto (although the cities are best seen at night).  Mount Chacaltaya is about 10 miles north of La Paz, Bolivia. Tour companies in La Paz offer trips to Chacaltaya Ski Resort, which cost about Bs. 150 (about $22 USD). You can also take a taxi from La Paz, which typically costs between Bs. 200 and 240 ($29 to $35), depending on how well you haggle. The drivers will normally wait for three hours at the ski resort while you look around. The trip from La Paz to the resort takes about 1.5 hours.",ski resorts world record glaciers climate change mountains restaurants

Like many mountains surrounding the La Paz area of Bolivia, the gutting formations contain rich variations of mineral content, creating colorful composition throughout the drastic landscape. Said to have been named by astronaut Neil Armstrong, the Valley of the Moon is located about 10 km southwest from La Paz, near the small town of Mallasa, and while a portion of the valley has been preserved, housing is steadily popping up on the unstable soil.

Part of Bolivia’s salt wonders of the altiplano, the lake, and its nearly-extinct flamingo population draw visitors to the bizarre, otherworldly landscape. Besides flamingo, the area is home to various fauna including llamas, alpacas, Andean foxes, ​cats, and pumas. The colors of Laguna Colorada stand out immediately upon seeing it. Tinged with red algae and other microorganisms, the water is a deep orange-red hue. Perfectly contrasted, the salt lake is dotted with large white pools caused by massive borax deposits on the lake’s surface. Combined with the rolling mountains and craggy rock shores, Laguna Colorada is an immaculate and beautiful wildlife area. Laguna Colorada is part of the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve, and in 1990 it was listed as a “Ramsar Wetland of International Importance.” Besides tourists, a rare breed of flamingo has also flocked to the area for centuries. James’s Flamingo, also called the puna flamingo, is native to the Andes and the Altiplano area. Although they seem plentiful on the shores of Colorada, they are in fact very rare. During the mid-1950s, scientists had all but written them off as extinct, until a pack was found roaming South America.

Four years later, when a team of scientists led by a famed Swiss paleontologist was able to visit, the wall was named “the largest site of dinosaur tracks found so far.” It’s unclear how the wall, called Cal Orcko, went undiscovered for so long, as it is filled with more than 5,000 tracks made during the second half of the Cretaceous period about 68 million years ago. There are so many tracks, actually — and they’re placed in such strange patterns — that some scientists refer to the area as a “dinosaur dance floor.” So far, six different types of dinosaur prints have been identified. One special track that measures 347 meters is the longest dinosaur trackway ever discovered and was made by a baby Tyrannosaurus rex nicknamed “Johnny Walker” by some of the local researchers. Eight other limestone walls with dinosaurs tracks have been found in the region. Millions of years ago, when dinosaurs walked the earth, this area was part of a huge shallow lake. The tectonic plate shifts during the Tertiary period that formed the great Andes Mountains also pushed some of these limestone walls out from the bed of the lake. The rock cliff measures about 325 feet tall and juts into the sky at a 70 degree angle.  Cal Orcko is a 20-minute ride from the colonial city of Sucre.

The little they left standing, they mislabeled with incorrect European designations with no oversight from the cultures they were trampling. The Horca del Inca is a perfect example of Spanish colonial misrepresentation. Horca del Inca, which means Gallows of the Inca, is not a gallows, and was not made by the Inca. Actually, the Horca del Inca was a pre-Incan astronomical observatory, built during the 14th century by the Chiripa people. The remains of the Horca del Inca was actually a part of seven trilithic structures, positioned to study the sun, moon and stars above Lake Titicaca. Unfortunately, the other six structures were destroyed by the Spanish, leaving only one of the horizontal beams in place. The purpose of the rock structure was only discovered in 1978, when a researcher noted that the sun shone through a different rock structure onto the cross beam of the Horca during the summer solstice. With the help of local guides, the steep and dangerous path to the Horca can be traversed for a closer look at the observatory.

Though Dalí never painted this particular Bolivian reserve, the arid, stark desert horizon coupled with strange rock formations strikes a strong resemblance to the famous surrealist’s work. The Árbol de Piedra, or Stone Tree, could be one of Dalí’s disturbing subjects. The base of the rock has been weathered away by wind and time, while the top remained intact.

83,Laguna Verde,Bolivia,"This lake’s emerald green waters are a spectacular sight, but it’s not a great place for a swim.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laguna-verde,"Laguna Verde lies in the extreme southwest of Bolivia, not far from the border with Chile. Depending on the strength of the winds, which whip up the water, minerals, and sediments within it, the color of the lake ranges from a tranquil turquoise to a brilliantly frothy emerald. The Altiplano, or high plains, region of Bolivia is known for its spectacular landscapes. The most famous of them all is Salar de Uyuni, the largest salt flat in the world. And to the south of the salt flats lie a series of high altitude lakes, many of which are known for—and named after—their distinct colored waters. Laguna Colorada is arguably the most famous lake in the region, both for its striking red waters and the thousands of pink flamingos who come to feed on its plankton. About 40 miles south of Laguna Colorada lies Laguna Verde, a smaller but no less spectacular lake with distinctly different characteristics. Laguna Verde, as the name suggests, is very, very green. And at times it looks… kind of toxic. Which is why flamingos choose not to feed in this particular lake. Laguna Verde has high concentrations of lead, sulfur, arsenic and calcium carbonates, making it less than appealing to all but the most resilient extremophiles. And due to the high mineral content, the waters of Lake Verde can remain liquid at temperatures as low as -6.16 degrees Fahrenheit (-21.2 degrees Celsius). But these same minerals give the lake its fantastic green color, making it a hotspot for photographers and fans of strange scenery. The picturesque nature of Laguna Verde is further enhanced by the presence of Volcán Licancabur, a stratovolcano whose near perfect cone rises up less than three miles to the southwest of the lake. Licancabur is considered a holy mountain, and archaeological sites have been found on its slopes and summit crater, which is said to have once concealed an Inca crypt.  Laguna Verde is located inside the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve in the extreme southwest of Bolivia, in the Sur Lípez Province of the Potosí Department. A narrow causeway separates Laguna Verde from the neighboring Laguna Blanca (White Lake), whose white color is also the result of minerals in the water. Many tourists visit the lakes during a multiday tour, which is often combined with Salar de Uyuni. The best time to visit Laguna Verde is during the dry season from April to September. Always take warm clothing, as the high altitude and strong winds can make for some extremely chilly conditions even when the sun is shining brightly (so don’t forget your sunscreen, either).",color lakes intriguing environs natural wonders ecosystems water nature
84,North Yungas Road,"Nor Yungas, Bolivia",Death road of Bolivia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/north-yungas-road,"Due to abysmal driving conditions, Yungas road in Bolivia has earned the nickname “Death Road,” and is included in several lists of the planet’s most dangerous routes. The road connects the Bolivian capital of La Paz with the low-lying region of Yungas in the Amazonian rainforest. In order to do so, the road must traverse the mighty Cordillera Oriental mountain chain. Starting from La Paz, the world’s highest capital at 3,660 meters in altitude, Yungas road first climbs to 4,650 meters at La Cumbre Pass and then makes a steep descent to the town of Coroico, at an altitude of only 1,200 meters. This drop of over 3,650 meters is one of the longest stretches of continuous downhill road in the world. By some estimates, between 200 and 300 people die a year on the road. Built in the 1930s by Paraguayan prisoners during the Chaco War, at places, it was cut into the steep cliffside. One side of the road is solid rock, and the other falls off into a 600-meter abyss. Most of the road is only 3.5 meters wide, and some sections are unpaved, without guardrails. Warm and humid winds from the Amazon hit upon the eastern slopes of Andes bringing heavy rains and fog drenching the already dangerous road in torrents of water. There are numerous mudslides and tumbling rocks, and small waterfalls occasionally rain down from the cliff sides. To make matters even worse, one is likely to meet groups of cyclists along this road. Internet fame turned this road into a destination for extreme sports enthusiasts, especially downhill bikers. Several tour operators organize such trips. Prices range roughly between $50-$100. At least 13 riders have died in various accidents in last the 10 years. Besides safety, travelers should also keep in mind that the downhill ride offers a change in temps from freezing to sweltering, thus, they should dress accordingly. Such conditions made several precautions necessary. Special rules apply at Yungas road. While the rest of Bolivia drives on the right side, here vehicles drive on the left. A driver on the left has a better view of the edge of the road. Furthermore, descending vehicles never have the right of way and must move to the outer edge of the road. This forces fast vehicles to stop so that passing can be negotiated safely. The government of Bolivia is trying to improve safety on its roads, but construction in such extreme terrain is costly and slow. The northernmost section of the original road has been replaced by an alternative route with a modern and much safer two-lane motorway. The road has gained certain attention in popular culture, including Top Gear’s Bolivia Special and the BBC show World’s Most Dangerous Roads. Update as of October 2020: Today, a new paved highway has safely diverted most vehicle traffic including buses off of the so-called Death Road leaving the original curving, narrow, dirt route to guided bike tours and individual drivers looking for an adventure.  Take some extra money with you if you fancy zip sliding down three zip lines at speeds of up to 52 miles/hr at the village at the bottom of the road.",extreme sports disaster areas roads
85,Cholita Wrestling,"La Paz, Bolivia",The celebrity luchadores of La Paz are tough ladies in traditional petticoats and braids.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cholita-wrestling,"Professional wrestling has a place among many cultures in Latin America, with masked luchadores taking to the ring from Mexico to Argentina. In La Paz, the most celebrated fighters of the night don’t wear spandex and masks, but bowler hats and frilly skirts. The Cholitas are the main event of the wrestling matches held at the Coliseo. The venue sits within a rapidly growing city filled with recent immigrants from rural Bolivia and the largest Amerindian population in the world. “Cholita” was traditionally a derogatory name for lower class women of mixed indigenous heritage. These wrestlers reclaim the term while poking fun at themselves, wearing the traditional costume of peasant women and playing up their feistiness. Much like professional wrestling in the U.S., lucha libre emphasizes theatrical entertainment over a real fight. The Cholitas really are tough though—they swing each other around the ring, bonk each other on the head, yank long braids, and pin each other in headlocks. They also spar with male opponents (and are usually the favorites in such matches). The matches are “supposed” to be confined to the ring, but when things get out of hand the luchadores are known to tussle throughout the auditorium and use all kinds of zany props. The most famous Cholitas even get the audience involved—they will steal beverages and kisses from handsome fans. Wrestling events take place at the Coliseo Cerrado Julio Borelli Viterito.

86,Chincana Ruins,"Comunidad Challapampa, Bolivia",Mysterious Incan ruins on a tiny island in Lake Titicaca.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chincana-ruins,"Isla del Sol (Island of the Sun) is a small island in Bolivia’s Lake Titicaca. On the northern side of the island is Chincana, an Incan settlement now in ruins. The Chincana ruins bear testimony to the island’s rich pre-Columbian history, as an important spot for Incas trading across the lake. Though the most ancient archaeological evidence unearthed at this site dates back to 2,200 BC, most of the ruins date to the 15th century, the time when Topa Inca Yupanqui (intriguingly translated as “Noble Inca Accountant”) was the Incan emperor. Yet there are speculations that a large structure was already in place here, and work was undertaken to expand it. Topa Inca Yupanqui became famous for extending the territory of the Inca Empire to the south, including Isla del Sol. The Chincana ruins center around this large structure, the Inca’s Palace. What remains of the palace today is a collection of stone walls and doorways laid out on a slope of the island. Within this complex is there is also a small well. Smaller and less preserved ruins can be found in the area surrounding the palace. Although it’s called a palace, it is unclear what this structure was supposed to be for. It doesn’t help that Chincana literally means “the place where one gets lost.” Some claim Isla del Sol to be the birthplace of the Incan Empire. According to one version of the Inca mythology, Manco Cápac was the son of Inti, the Sun God, and he was sent to Earth to found the Inca Empire. Manco Cápac was also venerated as the God of Fire. A disputed legend has it that Manco Cápac and his wife Mama Uqllu first appeared in a human form on Isla del Sol. This detour in the Inca mythology may not be supported by overwhelming evidence (the level of certainty as to what the Inca actually believed increases as more pieces of the puzzle are added), but it does provide an etymological explanation of the name of the island. A cynical mind could argue that rooting the mythological birth of the empire in the emperor’s newly annexed territories may have been an astute political move.  To get to Isla del Sol you’ll need to get a boat from Copacabana. It takes 1.5 hours to Yumani (in the south) and 2 hours to Challapampa (in the north). Once on the island, there are no roads and no motorized traffic. It is possible to visit the Chincana ruins on a day trip from Copacabana, but most of the day will be spent on the boat. The advantage of a day trip is that the boat will drop you at Challapampa, not too far from the ruins. An alternative to a day trip is spending one or two nights on the island—accommodation is available in both Yumani and Challapampa. This would allow you to hike across the whole island following the ancient Incan trail following the ridge of the hills, taking in great views of the Island, the lake, and the Cordillera Real at a distance. Beware that Lake Titicaca is already at a respectable 12,507 feet of elevation, and you’re only going higher.",incas cultures and civilizations islands ruins history

The city’s cemeteries are so full that that a crypt in the biggest one, the Cementerio General, is only reserved for 10 years, after which the remains need to be cremated and collected by the deceased’s family, or stored in a smaller space. Since its establishment in 1826, the Cementerio General, located between the city’s historic center and El Alto, has grown so much in size that it resembles a city in itself. Spread over 1.5 miles, the equivalent of 15 city blocks, the predominant sites are rows of individual concrete compartments, each set in structures over four stories high. The compact tombs stacked one above another are framed by a shrine covered with glass, which are decorated with flowers, photos, and other mementos that are placed there by bereaved families. These are added with the help of ladders to aid the deceased’s journey into the afterlife, and are part of a tradition where death is seen a continuation of life. The building facades painted with colorful murals frame an intricate series of alleys, where relatives organize parties, lunches, and family gatherings in front of their loved ones, and even play songs to the dead. The cemetery becomes even more boisterous during the “Day of the Dead” festivities, where each family visits their beloved relatives and spends the entire day there, feasting and celebrating. This colorful exterior masks the cemetery’s problems that are continually exacerbated by its rapid expansion and huge demand. Many people are buried without order and documents, and others are evicted if cemetery fees have not been paid. If fee deadlines are missed or cannot be met, the bodies are sometimes removed and cannot be traced. Easiest access from the Red Teleferico in central La Paz.

Many of its walls, building foundations, farm terraces, and interconnected system of roads and canals are still in use today. According to their origin myth, the first Incas, Manco Capac, son of the Sun god Inti and his sister/wife Mama Ocllo, daughter of the Moon, left Lake Titicaca in search of a place to found their empire. On the Island of the Moon, a small island in this sacred lake, the Incas later founded a “convent” (also called Iñakuyu) of virgins. The most favored of these virgins learned ceremonial rites to prepare them to marry Inti (although this, unfortunately, required that they give up their life on Earth). The lesser virgins at the temple were taught domestic skills such as planting, spinning, weaving, and medicine. Once they mastered their skills, the educated women traveled to other communities in the empire to share knowledge and solidify the Incan culture. The partially restored ruins of the temple overlook the lake with the Andes Mountains in the distance and ancient farm terraces covering the surrounding hills. Prominent in the walls of the ruins is the Chakana, or Inca Cross.

90,Palacio de Sal,"Daniel Campos, Bolivia",This hotel is located on the edge of the world's largest salt flat and is made out of the only material around.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-de-sal,"Nestled on the edge of a massive field of glimmering salt is the Palacio de Sal, a commercial hotel which is constructed out of blocks of pure salt. The current Palacio de Sal sits in Bolivia over 15 miles from the nearest town or sign of life, but this is actually the second such salt lodging to be built in the area after the first was abandoned. The Salar de Uyuni, the world’s largest salt flat, is over 4,000 miles of hot, barren crust in which almost nothing can grow. Despite the inhospitable climate, the natural phenomenon has long been a popular tourist destination. In order to capitalize on this trend one enterprising businessman decided to build a small hotel smack dab in the middle of the salty sea. With no other natural resources in the area, the builders simply mined blocks of salt to create everything in the establishment from the walls to the beds to the tables and chairs. There was even a strictly enforced rule against licking the walls and furniture. Unfortunately the hard ground made creating proper waste management systems difficult and soon the site was overcome with waste and unsanitary conditions. Built in the early 90’s the original Palacio de Sal was closed by 2002. The current Palacio de Sal was built in 2007 closer to civilization and with better plumbing but from the same type of salt blocks as the original. The expanded site features 32 rooms built of salt blocks and is much more upscale than the first one, however the no licking rule is still firmly in place.",deserts places to stay hotels shops
91,Museo de la Coca,"La Paz, Bolivia",Museum dedicated to the sacred leaf of the Andes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-de-la-coca,"The Coca leaf generally gets a bad rap. When coca comes up in conversation in the United States, it’s usually in relation to its powdered derivative that lines the noses of businessman and rockstars. The Museo de la Coca spends much of its time in a desperate effort to destroy this image, and educate its patrons on the long history of coca before it was the well-known synthetic stimulant cocaine. In some ways, the Museo de la Coca is an anti-defamation organization, although definitely the most bizarre of any similar group. In telling the story of coca and the sacred leaf’s positive uses, the museum employs both a classic museum format, and a living public service announcement complete with a replica cocaine lab and a model addict carrying an old television set. Since the first people inhabited the Andes, the coca leaf has played an important role in religious ceremonies, rites of passage and even social situations. Although not nearly as potent as its chemically altered cousin, coca leaves have long been chewed for their stimulating properties, and used similarly to coffee or alcohol. Besides telling the tale of coca’s evolution into a problematic drug in the United States and an international pariah, the museum aims to provide a commercial outlet for coca leaves outside of drug manufacturing. The creators of the museum hope that their legal approach to the natural leaf will allow for legal cultivation. Bolivia has long worked to destroy coca plantations used for cocaine production without hurting local farmers who rely on the product. For those wishing to support the legal use of coca, a coca-distilled alcohol is available for a purchase after a quick jaunt through coca’s history in the museum.",pharmacy museums museums and collections
92,Sajama Lines,"Sajama, Bolivia",A mysterious ancient network of thousands of perfectly straight lines stretching across miles of Bolivian desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sajama-lines,"If you look at a satellite image of western Bolivia’s desolate Altiplano plateau, it will appear as if there are thousands of perfectly straight roads criss-crossing each other for no practical reason, stretching for miles and apparently leading to nowhere. Dig deeper, and you’ll discover that these are not roads at all, but white lines etched into the desert sand. These strange geoglyphs are a network of ancient paths etched into the earth by the indigenous people of the region some 3,000 years ago. They are found near the Nevado Sajama volcano, the highest point in Bolivia. The thousands of individual lines, each three to ten feet in width, are almost perfectly straight mile after mile in spite of the rugged terrain of the highlands—quite a feat for the indigenous people who paved them without modern technology. Positioned end to end, the Sajama Lines would cover 10,000 miles of terrain, leading many to call the lines the world’s largest work of art. However their exact origins are unknown to this day. The geoglyphs were most likely created through the process of scraping away the dark oxidized rock on the surface to reveal a lighter surface beneath. The question is, why did these people take the time and effort to pave such seemingly illogical criss-crossing trails? One theory suggests that the lines were forged to serve as footpaths leading to shrines and sacred sites, but this remains unconfirmed. A team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania is currently investigating the history of the lines, but as of now, their origins remain a mystery. Although it is possible to visit the Sajama Lines in person, perhaps the most comprehensive way to see them is to scan the satellite view of Google Maps. Only then can the true magnitude of the lines, which seem to stretch on to infinity, be witnessed.",geoglyphs geographic markers prehistoric cultures and civilizations geological oddities geology
93,Torotoro National Park Dinosaur Footprints,Bolivia,Thousands of fossilized footprints speckle this Bolivian national park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/torotoro-national-park,"There are plenty of things to see and do in Bolivia’s Torotoro National Park. You can trek along the numerous canyons that cut through the semi-arid landscape, the deepest reaching depths of almost 1,000 feet. You can bathe in natural swimming pools, some fed by pristine waterfalls that tumble down the canyon walls. Or you can descend into the Humajalanta Caverns, one of the deepest cave systems in the country, and explore underground lagoons filled with blind fish. And as you travel through the park, you’ll often stop to see another of Torotoro’s grand attractions: dinosaur footprints. So far, more than 3,500 dinosaur footprints and trackways have been found inside the park, belonging to eight different species that roamed this area in the Cretaceous Period. Back then, of course, the landscape was entirely different. During the Cretaceous, this area was near a vast ocean inlet whose wetlands provided an ideal habitat for dinosaurs—a far cry from the arid, rugged canyons in what is now landlocked Bolivia. As the dinosaurs migrated through these wetlands, they naturally left footprints in the mud. These dried and, to cut a very long story short, later turned into stone. The Earth’s crust then shifted over time, leaving us with the dinosaur footprints we now see in Torotoro, the oldest of which date back around 86 million years. A few different groups left these footprints, which range in size from about eight to 20 inches wide. They included herbivorous sauropods, huge creatures with very large feet; armor-plated ankylosaurs with their hefty tail clubs; and carnivorous theropods with hollow bones and three-toed limbs, from which birds probably originated. Torotoro National Park has understandably become a hotspot for paleontologists, and there’s still a lot more it can teach us about the dinosaurs. Local researchers are certain that many more dinosaur fossils and footprints are waiting to be discovered in the park, providing a potential boon to both science and, of course, tourism.  The drive from Cochabamba to Torotoro is now only just over two hours as they have finished paving much of what used to be a dirt road.",paleontology dinosaurs fossils national parks animals
94,Carnaval de Oruro,"Oruro, Bolivia",This devil-dancing ceremony now celebrates a miraculous image of the Virgin Mary that appeared to a modern-day Robin Hood in a mineshaft.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/carnaval-de-oruro,"While the Carnival de Oruro has been taking place in the Bolivian city of Oruro for countless centuries it was only in recent times that the significant, and quite odd, Christian themes were added to the traditionally pagan devils and dancing. Other than being briefly outlawed in the 1700s by the ruling Spanish government, the Carnival de Oruro has been trotting out the colorful costumes and specialized dances for centuries. The parade was created to honor the tribal gods of the area such as Quwak the Viper and Argentillo Arankani the Lizard with elaborate, eye-popping costumes. By the 1800s the rowdy festival had been tamed by the Christian government by placing it under the auspices of the strange local saint, Our Lady of the Mineshaft. As the story goes, an infamous bandit who was known for stealing from the rich to give to the poor was being chased and took refuge in a local mineshaft. Mortally wounded, the rogue repented his sins before God, and when his body was finally found, a mural of the Virgin Mary had appeared on the wall behind him. A church was built over the mineshaft and the miraculous mural was put on display in the chapel, where it can still be visited. Today the festival continues to take place every year on March 2nd, the feast day of the mineshaft miracle Mary. It is still a strange mash-up of ancient tradition and modern religion, but as the costumed revelers dance the Diablada, the roots of the carnival are plain to see.",carnival saints festivals churches sacred spaces
95,Potosí Silver Mines,"Potosi, Bolivia","Mountain of unimaginable riches that bankrolled the Spanish Empire, complete with its own underworld god.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/potosi-silver-mines,"At a height of over 4,000 meters, Potosí, capital of the Bolivian state of the same name, is one of the highest cities in the world. But even an elevation as high as this does not stop the nearby Cerro Potosí from dominating the surrounding landscape. Also known as Cerro Rico (Spanish for “Rich Mountain”), the peak’s huge supply of silver has led to both immense riches and appalling suffering. Potosí was founded as a mining town in 1546, while Bolivia was still part of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Over the next 200 years, more than 40,000 tons of silver were shipped out of the town, making the Spanish Empire one of the richest the world had ever seen. But such vast wealth also came at a price. Thousands of the indigenous people were forced to work at the mines, where many perished through accidents, brutal treatment, or poisoning by the mercury used in the extraction process. Around 30,000 African slaves were also brought to the city, where they were forced to work and die as human mules. In 1672, Potosí became the site of the Spanish Colonial Mint and, with a population of around 200,000, was one of the richest cities in the world. But by the time that Bolivia declared independence in 1825, the silver had largely run out, leaving tin as the main product. To this day, a workers’ collective extracts minerals from the mine. Due to the lack of protective equipment, the work is still very dangerous. Many miners die in cave-ins or from silicosis, a serious disease that damages the lungs, and there’s been recent concern of the whole mine collapsing. Because of the hellish conditions, many of the miners survive by drinking extremely strong alcohol, chewing coca leaves, and worshiping Tio — a god of the underworld who holds the power of life and death between his fingers. El Tio, meaning “the Uncle,” appears as a devilish creature, and his statues in the mines are given offerings of cigarettes, strong alcohol, and coca leaves.",subterranean mines subterranean sites
96,La Paz Cebritas,"La Paz, Bolivia",A black and white solution to the Bolivian city's traffic problems.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-paz-cebritas,"In La Paz, Bolivia, traffic lights are more of a loose suggestion than a strict requirement, and street signs tend to be followed only as long as someone is there to report any infractions. Yet despite this nonchalant attitude toward the rules of the road, the number of traffic incidents in the city has been consistently on the decline, thanks to a group of plush, fun-loving zebras. The zebras, or “Cebritas”, are inspired by Colombia’s “traffic mimes,” a group of ordinary citizens dressed up as street mimes using humour to engage the public toward better behaviour. In the early 2000s, when La Paz’s road safety hit an all-time low, the government deployed 24 “zebras” in a final attempt to create safer roads for its citizens. The good samaritans dressed as zebras playfully encourage drivers to follow traffic laws and watch out for pedestrians. The zebra was chosen because of its likeness to the striped pedestrian crossings and because it added a bit of humour to an otherwise serious subject. Each Cebrita engages with the public in its own, unique way. Some will play hide and seek with buses while others form conga lines to merrily dance their way across intersections. Yet others will add dramatic flair to their performance by throwing themselves onto the hood of any car that has inched its way just a bit too far over a pedestrian crossing. Since the programme’s inception in 2001, the Cebritas have grown to over 400 in number and come from all walks of life, anyone from university students to those recovering from substance abuse. Tactfully combining education with fun, the Cebritas have become La Paz’s single most successful programme for alleviating traffic-related incidents. They have also recently become part of a variety of other public services projects, illustrating the extensiveness of their role. Despite their serious roles as stewards of public safety, the Cebritas will be more than happy to pose for a photo or swing dance with you across the street. For some lucky visitors, the Cebritas offer a “zebra for a day” programme where anyone can be part of the striped family to help keep La Paz’s roads safe. Just ask a Cebrita and you’ll find out how. Cebritas normally operate during peak commuting times at the busier intersections in the city centre and in El Alto. The coordinates listed are for the Avenida 16 de Julio, which is one such busy intersection where the Cebritas are often present.

At this colorful street fair you can buy miniatures of every kind, and the tradition holds that if there is something you truly desire in the upcoming year, the sure-fire way to ensure it comes your way is to buy a tiny version of it at the Alasitas market at noon on January 24. Those wishing for domestic wealth can pick up miniature farm animals, tools, and food products. Maybe a new vehicles is your desire; how about a tiny truck, car, or bus? Just want some money? There are lots of doll-sized banknotes, in Bolivian currency or US dollars of course. You could wish for travel (miniature passports, plane tickets, suitcases), real estate or furnishings (miniature houses, property deeds, chairs, pots and pans), love or marriage (miniature marriage licenses, bridal dresses, tuxedos), or even a new maid (miniature domestic servant). Your ambition and imagination seem to be the only limit on the things you can find at the festival. The deity that presides over Alasitas is Ekeko, the smiling god of plenty, wearing an traditional chullo and weighed down with riches, and usually depicted smoking a cigarette. The Alasitas market goes on all month, and most paceños make it a point to go and purchase some wished-for items, even if they don’t make it there at the crucial 12 noon magic hour; it’s fun to simply to browse among all the interesting items and eat street food.",miniatures festivals

It’s a feast for the eyes, made possible by a troubling concoction of Old World colonialism and New World traditions. The church is part of the mission of San Xavier (sometimes also spelled San Javier). The mission was first established in 1691, but moved around a bit before finding its permanent spot in the 18th century. A Swiss Jesuit architect completed the church that still stands today in 1752. Missions sprouted up across Bolivia during the 17th and 18th centuries. Each one typically featured a church, workshop, and school, all centered around a courtyard. Jesuits sent by the Spanish Crown to explore the South American frontiers created them to convert the indigenous people to Christianity. Despite their colonial pasts, which sadly involved removing native people from their homes and forcing them to convert, the missions stand as beautiful examples of New World religious architecture. Their layouts were inspired by concepts of what 16th-century European philosophers believed formed a perfect city. Most of the wood and adobe structures are capped with slanted roofs and boasted vivid colors and designs. The mission churches in particular are gorgeous hybrids of typical Catholic architecture and local indigenous traditions. Unlike other missions in South America, the Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos managed to survive after the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish territories in 1767. Six still stand today: San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco, San José de Chiquitos, Concepción, San Miguel de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco. They’re listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The mission of San Xavier was one of the first to receive such recognition.

99,Cristo de la Concordia,"Cochabamba, Bolivia",This giant Christ took first place in South America's religious arms race.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cristo-de-la-concordia,"Inspired by a visit from Pope John Paul II, Cristo de la Concordia dominates the skyline of a Bolivian town. Designed by César and Wálter Terrazas Pardo and hewn entirely of cement and concrete, construction lasted from 1987 through 1994 before the world’s the second largest Jesus statue was finally completed. Sometimes referred to as the “Christ of Peace,” Cochabamba’s colossal statue rises 869 feet above the city below. At 33 meters high, Cristo de la Concordia is nearly exactly the height of Río de Janiero’s Christ the Redeemer; the architects of both statues suggest that one meter was allotted for each year of Christ’s life. However, El Cristo de la Concordia once held the title of “World’s Largest Christ Statue” by towering over its more famous brother in Río thanks to an added 44 centimeters of well-coiffed hair atop Christ’s head. Cochabambinos like to say this petty – nay, monumental – difference accounts for the fact that the historic Christ died while He was “a little bit past” His 33rd year on the planet. Regardless of the architectural one-upmanship – that game’s as old as the church itself, after all – Bolivia’s giant Christ beckons visitors up to his steep, rocky perch. Choose to take 1250 steps to its base, or the perennially entertaining cable car offering a lift to the top for a nominal fee. Bolstering its appeal is a weekly invitation into His literal folds each and every Sunday; the statue’s outstretched arms and inner sanctum of His head serve as viewing platforms, providing a birds-eye glimpse of the benevolent, holy gaze el Cristo bestows upon the townspeople below.",world's tallest world's largest statues

In El Alto, at the outskirts of La Paz, stands a 30-foot-tall statue of Che Guevara entirely made of scrap metal—various parts of engines, cogs, wheels, and other mechanical spare parts. In addition to the unique material, this statue has also two distinctive features. First, Che Guevara is portrayed as trampling on a bald eagle, an obvious allusion to the aversions that Che Guevara harboured for the United States. Second, his face resembles that of an indigenous person, which can be interpreted as a form of appropriation. Sculptor Felix Duran is the artist that created this intriguing monument to an intriguing historical figure. Like it or hate it, this is a unique piece of art.",revolution outsider art statues art
101,Tinku,"Macha, Bolivia","A giant, bloody battle rages throughout the Bolivian Andes each year.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tinku,"In the Bolivian Aymara tradition, tinku has its origins in a ritualistic form of combat dating back to the time of the Spanish Conquistadors, who arrived in the region of Potosí and enslaved the indigenous population. Not one to give up dancing in the face of oppression, since that day tinku has proved the cathartic exercise of choice for the Aymara and Quechua peoples. Tinku continues to be wildly popular throughout the Andes, taking place each year in the early weeks of May. Nowhere is this more true than in the Potosí region of Bolivia. Within this area, the farming community of Santiago de Macha — or simply “Macha” for short — has the most notoriously bloody incarnation, where upwards of 3,000 participants file into the city during the Festival de la Cruz each year. Fueled by alcohol and the corn brew chicha, to say Macha’s modern tinku gets “a little rough” is an understatement. Wearing bright costumes, sandals, and helmet-like hats made of leather, there’s a reason the men look like they’re preparing for an ancient battle; hand-to-hand combat is the name of the game, with some participants going so far as to wrap cloth spiked with glass shards around their forearms for extra umph. Others pack slingshots and whips in their belts, though this is less in keeping with tradition. Warlike in rhythm, the festival begins with both men and women dancing together, only for the women to back away, encircling the men. From there, things escalate quickly into a ritualized brawl which hasn’t changed much over the centuries. Police and authorities are present, but step aside once the rock throwing begins. Death isn’t a rare occurrence during tinku. It’s of utmost import to note that these skirmishes aren’t personal in nature; instead the mayhem is more of a designated space-time for locals to have an outlet for whatever is plaguing them. Or, as Atlas Obscura writer Dan Nosowitz put it, tinku is “a way to vent and avoid existing in a state of anger for the entire year.” Much like those individuals whose bragging rights include participating in tinku their whole lives, the fact that the festival itself has survived for centuries against improbable odds demonstrates the power of a bold heart to weather time itself.",combat festivals rites and rituals war history military

The doors of this massive library were opened in 1887, bringing a nearly endless collection of Portuguese texts to readers in Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of the Empire of Brazil. The cabinet was founded in 1822 by a trio of Portuguese immigrants who wanted to bring their country’s literary tradition to the newly independent nation of Brazil, which had previously been a Portuguese colony since 1500. The collection’s current home was built specifically to house their growing collection, and was designed to evoke a Gothic-Renaissance influence that was popular at the time. At 350,000 titles, the collection soon became the largest collection of Portuguese works outside of Portugal; it includes rare original manuscripts, singular works of literature, and unique proofs. Today the collection receives around 6,000 new titles a year and the collection is rising towards 400,000 volumes. The walls are lined with rising strata of stacks creating one of the most fantastical atmospheres in the world.

After years of service to the crown, the square eventually fell into disrepair until famed Brazilian journalist Sylvia de Arruda Botelho Bittencourt and her husband helped restore the plaza. One of the notable houses, A Casa Cor-de-Rosa (The Pink House), was once owned by the couple. The brightly painted houses are a perfect representation of late 18th century Portuguese colonial architecture, and the plaza is a calm and verdant oasis in the center of a city. The sound of the river Carioca and the buildings that stand in a state of quiet disrepair give the whole place a very laid back and unfussy atmosphere that is a pleasant chaser to a night of dancing in Lapa. Away from aggressive beach vendors and taxi cabbies, soaking in the spirit of old Rio in the Largo do Boticario is an intimate experience. The painters and art dealers who live in the area are generally welcoming and sometimes let visitors into their homes for a small tip. Its status as a somewhat obscure tourist attraction and out of the way location makes it an attractive stop for those who wish to explore the more traditional neighborhoods of Laranjeiras and Cosme Velho, which are in themselves filled with odd curiosities and low key attractions.

Small pools and eddys collect in the spherical cutouts but the river iself has largely receded to leave its creations exposed. Of course the river is not always so visitor friendly. During heavy rains, the valley floods quickly and violently, making it off limits whenever the skies cloud over. The Vale da Lua is located on private property near to national forest, however it is still open to visitors.

California’s giant sequoias and redwoods are famous, and rightly so. But the world’s largest cashew tree, or cajueiro, is a unique experience within the woody wonders of the world. Strolling inside the sprawling canopy, you may think you are walking in an entire lush, green forest of cashew trees, but you are actually walking within one single tree. The tree covers about two acres, almost the size of two football fields, equivalent to about 70 normal-size cashew trees. The age of the giant tree is murky. Some think it was first planted in 1888, but others claim it’s thousands of years old. In any case it still produces a large amount of fruit and nuts. (In Brazil, the cashew tree is prized more for its delicious but, alas, un-transportable fruit even more than its nuts.) The tree’s record size is believed to be the result of two different genetic mutations. One, the branches grow sideways instead of upwards, eventually being weighted down and touching the ground. Second, instead of just growing along the earth as expected, when a branch touches the soil it sets down roots. Thus the tree spreads like a forest with multiple trunks growing over the two acres. Making the experience even more wonderful is the beautiful drive along the Brazilian coast down from Natal. The tree is located near the popular Praia de Pirangi (Pirangi Beach) in Brazil’s Rio Grande do Norte state. Just follow the cashew-shaped signs and you will be at the tree in 20 minutes. Admission is cheap. Yes, they charge admission to a tree. The tree is surrounded by an equal or greater amount of acreage dedicated to souvenir shops selling all sorts of cashew-themed souvenirs.

It’s the final resting place for people like Father Diogo Feijó, who was a regent of Brazil during Emperor Dom Pedro II’s 19th-century reign and Bartolomeu Lourenço de Gusmão, a visionary and the creator of an 18th-century airship design. The crypt also houses the giant brass tomb of Chief Tibiriçá, a 16th-century native who converted to Christianity and helped the Portuguese Jesuits colonize São Paulo. Construction on the neo-Gothic cathedral began in 1913 and lasted for four decades. Over 800 tons of rare marble were used in its making. Everything except the towers were completed in time for the city’s 400th anniversary in 1954. Despite having a Renaissance-style dome, the cathedral is still known as the world’s fourth largest neo-Gothic temple. It’s the main house of worship for the parish of Our Lady of the Assumption of São Paulo, which was created on August 10, 1591.

It has been featured in music videos for Pharell Williams, Snoop Dogg, and the Black Eyed Peas, but remains relatively quiet as its out of the way for most tourists. Once owned by industrialist Enrique Lage and his wife, a famous singer during her time, the mansion was remodeled in the 1920s by Italian architect Mario Vodrel. Decades later, in the 1960s, the land was converted into a public park and walking trails were installed through the subtropical forests of Tijuca National Park that surround the mansion. Monkeys can be seen feasting in the trees high above the trails. The grounds also include musty old stables, a mysterious cave, a castle-like tower, a massive aquarium. The mansion now houses an art school, the Escola de Artes Visuals do Parque Lage (Visual Arts School of Parque Lage), which showcases galleries of student art to visitors and hosts a courtyard cafe. Also, from the back-end of the park begins a hiking trail that leads to the top of Corcovado, just below Christ the Redeemer (Cristo Redentor in Brazilian Portuguese), passing by waterfalls on your way up.",follies and grottoes architectural oddities architecture

In Brazil, they build tall towers of cement-like Earth. These termite mounds can grow quite large with diameters up to 30 meters, and towers reaching heights of 7 meters or more. Not only do they provide a home for up to several million termites, they’re also used as nesting sites for the Buff-breasted Paradise-Kingfisher and as home to hundreds of glowing Pyrophorus beetle larvae. At night, the termite mounds look like they’re wrapped in Christmas lights. A UNESCO World Heritage site, Emas National Park is a wonderland of waterfalls, mountains, and savannah. You can find maned wolves, rhea (large, ostrich-like birds), tapirs, toucans and jaguars roaming here. And while any of these is worth a visit, the most breathtaking nocturnal site is the series of glowing termite mounds. The Pyrophorus nyctophanus beetle (also known as the Headlight Beetle) is bioluminescent as an adult, but it’s the larvae that truly shine. Adult beetles lay their eggs in the sides of termite mounds. When the young hatch, they glow with a green light bright enough to read by. While the adults eat plants, the young are carnivorous and their lights are a lure. Unsuspecting insects will make their way towards the pretty lights only to be seized for a meal by the voracious larvae. And yes, termites are a favorite food. In fact, the larval growth cycle is timed to take advantage of termite migrations, and many a termite will meet its end in the jaws of an inconsiderate houseguest. The glowing mounds are best seen in the savannas during the summer, though they can be found in the jungles as well. The terrain can be quite rugged, but there are several private tour outfits that can guide you.",bug week insects nature animals

Construction on the Rio-Santos Highway began in the 1960s and by 1976 the stretch of road was due to be linked to the existing highway. However, the plans were altered at the last minute so that the existing road was linked to a coastal route and the newly constructed, but never used viaduct was simply abandoned. Over 40 meters tall and 300 meters long, the elevated roadway features tunnels, retaining walls, and a massive concrete foundation all being slowly taken over by the surrounding greenery. While the abandoned civic project seemed wasteful at the time, it is now a popular tourist attraction for travelers looking to do some rappelling and bungee jumping. The abandoned Viaduct Petrobras can be accessed from the Salesopolis Caragua neighborhood in Porto Novo via a thin country road, but the structure must be approached on foot or motorbike for the final stretch.",forests roads ecosystems abandoned ruins architectural oddities architecture

Construction on the massive cathedral began in the late 1960s, and continued on into the 1970s. Designed by architect Edgar Fonseca, the modern temple was intended to echo the ancient Mayan pyramids. The church can hold as many as 20,000 people (if standing room is included), and includes a museum in the basement, a markedly more efficient use of space than the Mayans had. It also incorporates features such as ornate doors made of dozens of religious-themed bronze plaques. While each tilting wall of the modern pyramid is covered in small, square windows that give it the look of a space-age honeycomb, towering stained glass windows run down the center of each wall as well. The giant colored windows reach over 200 feet up from the floor, straight to the tip of the church. At the top, they connect to the four points of a crucifix-shaped skylight, that is set into the flat ceiling, made up of the same honeycomb pattern of panels as the walls.

It is also a city where street art is celebrated, and by walking 560 feet along Rio’s waterfront, you can appreciate the largest mural graffiti in world, a Guinness World Record accomplishment and a legacy of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. The work depicts a Tajapo boy from Brazil, a Mursi woman from Ethiopia, a Kayin woman from Thailand, a Supi man from Northern Europe, and a Huli man from Papua New Guinea. They represent humanity’s common ancestors, the indigenous people from America, Asia, Europe, Africa and Oceania. Eduardo Kobra, a world-renowned Brazilian graffiti artist, studied the features of people from five continents that represent the black, blue, green, red, and gold rings on the Olympic flag. Etnias (or Ethnicities), or as it was originally named by the artist Todos Somos Um (We Are One), is a visual feast for street art lovers and a way to celebrate the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, the first and only time the event was hosted in South America. As he carries the core values of the Olympic Games, the artist’s intention was to show that everyone is connected, We Are One. Kobra’s work makes us feel his characters’ intense and powerful gaze, so we can feel our common wisdom. The Rio Olympics broke not only sports records, but also one unexpected one, creating the largest street mural spray-painted by one single artist. This work was commissioned by the International Olympic Committee and it is nearly twice the size of the mural that held the previous record in Mazatlan, Mexico, as artist Ernesto Rocha’s mural was just 18,066 square feet. Kobra worked for 12 hours a day, for two months, so he could complete Etnias just before the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. About 100 gallons of white paint, 400 gallons of colored paint, and 2,800 cans of spray paint were used by Kobra and his team. But, after all his work, the artist didn’t get to stay and enjoy the Rio Olympics, as he had to fly to Ohio to complete a mural graffiti of Neil Armstrong. Kobra is responsible for other iconic street art murals in cities such as New York, London, Tokyo and Amsterdam. His style includes bright colors, geometric shapes, and quilted patterns. Along the Olympic Boulevard, you can also find other murals by graffiti artists André Camila Cadiz, JR or Rita Wainer.",ethnographic olympics world's largest graffiti murals art

Located on the edge of the Preguiças River in Brazil, the seeming desert region is just adjacent to the tropical Amazon Basin which is generally lush, wet, and green. This being the case, the Lençóis Maranhenses dunes are subject to the nearby area’s torrential rainy seasons. Between the months of July and September, the depressions between the dunes fill with rainwater creating pools ranging from small ponds to deep lakes. Like any real desert, the 1,500 square kilometer area supports little plant life despite the rain, but the transient bodies of water amazingly populate with marine life each year as migratory birds accidentally deposit fish eggs in the waters. Most of the underwater life dies off when the pools evaporate during the dry season, but the local human population is able to maintain a healthy fishing trade nonetheless. The Lençóis Maranhenses Dunes are recognized as a national park and are closely protected, not allowing vehicles within the recognized borders of the park, but it’s just as well since breaking down in the desert is bad enough without having to worry about drowning.",oasis deserts geological oddities water geology
114,Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",The largest library in Latin America owes its existence to an Old World earthquake and a Napoleonic invasion.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/biblioteca-nacional-do-brasil,"The Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil in Rio de Janeiro is the largest library in Latin America and the seventh largest in the world. But were it not for a devastating earthquake and a Napoleonic invasion, it may never have reached such heights. On November 1, 1755, a massive earthquake almost destroyed the city of Lisbon, the capital of the Kingdom of Portugal. Between 10,000 and 100,000 people were killed in the city, and countless buildings turned to rubble, in what remains one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Also lost in the quake was the 70,000-volume Royal Library inside the devastated Royal Ribeira Palace. At the time, this library was considered one of the finest and most important in Europe. Soon after the earthquake, King Joseph I of Portugal organized the construction of a new Royal Library, and over the next half century the collection grew significantly with many valuable books and prints. Still, the threat of another major quake loomed over the library, prompting talk of moving the entire collection to the Portuguese colony of Brazil. The Napoleonic Wars gave the royal collection its final push towards the New World. When an Imperial French corps under Jean-Andoche Junot invaded Portugal in 1807, Portugal’s then Prince Regent John of Braganza (later John VI of Portugal) decided to flee to Brazil, along with the rest of the royal family. As quickly as he could, John gathered up the collection from the royal library and had it loaded onto the Portuguese fleet. The Prince Regent, along with the first batch of his prized collection, arrived in Rio de Janeiro on March 7, 1808. A second batch, packed in 230 crates, arrived in mid-1810. On October 29, 1810, John founded a new Royal Library on Brazilian soil, which would later become the Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil, or National Library of Brazil. Today, the Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil houses a collection of approximately 9 million items, and is considered one of the main national libraries in the world by UNESCO. General works account for some 2 million pieces, occupying about 11 linear miles of shelf space. The collection also contains 21,742 photos from the 19th century; 22,000 maps and about 2,500 atlases; and some 250,000 pieces in its music and sound archive. And ever since an official decree in 1907, Brazilian publishers are required to send one copy of every title they publish to the Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil, ensuring that the collection will continue to grow and grow. The Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil is located at Avenida Rio Branco 219 on Cinelândia Square in central Rio. It’s open to the public Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturdays from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.",

And there is much to see at this gigantic open-air contemporary art center, surrounded by 500,000 acres of botanical gardens in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The sight of an igloo or a floating block of concrete, a labyrinth of mirrors camouflaged in a way that butterflies bash into it, or a kaleidoscopic telescope, is part of the experience of a world-class collection of over 1,300 works of art produced from 1960 until today. A chauffeured golf cart will park by your side before you decide what to see first. You can choose to walk or to take a ride through lakes, valleys, forest areas, and gardens. Of Instituto Inhotim’s 500,000 acres of botanical gardens, about 100,000 are opened for visitation and ready to awe with an extensive collection of exotic and rare tropical species and numerous palm trees from all over the world. Away from the Brazilian urban setting, Inhotim allows time to contemplate and embrace contemporary art as one with the surrounding lush nature. The interactive works of art are impressive and mesmerizing. There is a pavilion where every object is red and red is the experience. In another pavilion, inspired by artists Hélio Oiticica and Neville D’Almeida’s Cosmococa, visitors enter rooms where they’re promised to experience the feeling of being on cocaine. In one room, Jimi Hendrix plays guitar while a pillow fight brings in chaos; another room is filled with hammocks; in the end, there is a lit indoor pool. There are 23 pavilions and permanent galleries of artists from 30 different countries. To some, the idea of building a gigantic museological complex, pavilions, and galleries with contemporary artwork on display in the open air in the middle of Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, might have sounded like a far-fetched, megalomaniac project. But to Brazilian billionaire Bernardo Paz, who planned out the construction of Instituto Inhotim in 2006, building one of the most daring, ambitious, and creative art museums in the world is not impossible. Today, Instituto Inhotim is an active nonprofit when it comes to developing educational programs, providing access to cultural assets to the community, and improving the quality of life in the region. The long-term plan is to turn the place into a destination in itself. Spas and resorts are being planned, and there are new pavilions under construction and plans to organize film festivals and events to promote environmental awareness, cultural empowerment, and diversity. In the future, Paz believes it will take about 12 days to fully take in this unique, unparalleled, sensorial, and aesthetic experience.  The museum does not open on Mondays.

These “images of the unconscious” allow viewers to establish a bridge between their own world and the deepest yearnings, fears, traumas, joys, and dreams of the artists. Inspiring and colorful, the Images of the Unconscious Museum (Museu de Imagens do Inconsciente) displays an incredible collection of art as well as the research that led to a different way of approaching psychological health. The often-overlooked museum in Rio displays more than 350,000 works by patients, and historical documents about the process. Nise da Silveira, a pioneering female psychiatrist who introduced Carl Jung’s work to Brazil, founded the Museum of Images of the Unconscious in 1952 as a research center and collection of works created by patients. Silveira didn’t believe in the contemporary inhumane forms of treatment like electroshock therapy or lobotomization. She created a clinic where patients could freely express themselves through art. Her research in occupational therapy brought new insights into the images of the unconscious, and she studied the emotional bond between patients and animals, whom she considered co-therapists. Silveira’s work is as important to the medical community as it is to the art world. Books, movies, and documentaries have been inspired by her research and her patients’ artworks. Entirely dedicated to the study and research of mental health, the Brazilian museum and research center is recognized worldwide for its groundbreaking work and unique art collection. It is registered by the National Historical and Artistic Heritage Institute.",psychology psychiatry art history health collections art museums

The church’s brick facade makes it appear to be a factory or something similar, but the archways that stand clear of the water tell the true story of the strangely haunting relic. While Old Petrolandia was still inhabited, the church must have been the centerpiece of the town with its tall arch.

His company was selling thousands upon thousands of cars and needed massive amounts of rubber to make tires. Unfortunately, rubber manufacturers in East Asia were running a virtual monopoly that drove up the price of raw materials. Ford’s idea: Create the world’s largest rubber plantation in the middle of the Amazon forest, which after all is the native habitat of rubber trees. The auto tycoon bought over six million acres and named his Americanized colony Fordlândia. Ford went so far as to build a modern hospital, a power plant, a library, a golf course, a hotel, and thousands of little white clapboard houses for the employees to live in. Eventually, as the community grew, other businesses such as bakeries, butcher shops, restaurants, and shoemakers were established. Ford employees from America were relocated to this little piece of America along the Amazon River where they—along with the native Brazilian workers who moved into the settlement to work at the factory—were forced to live the mandatory “healthy lifestyle.” This included attending poetry readings, square dances, and English-language-only singalongs, and abstaining from alcohol, which was prohibited in Fordlândia. Unfortunately Fordlândia proved to be wildly unsuccessful. The rubber saplings that Ford had planted (without the help of a botanist) were barely growing, and those that did grow were soon hit by a leaf blight, which ruined the remaining trees. By the end of the 1920s malaria became a serious problem. In December 1930 agitated workers rioted, breaking windows and overturning vehicles in the road. After the riots, which lasted less than three days, work continued, but there was almost no product to show for the millions of dollars Ford had poured into the jungle. In 1933, after coming to terms with the failure, Ford purchased a new plot of land downriver and called it Belterra. At first the land showed promise, but progress was slow. After 10 years of work, Ford realized that his goal of 38,000 tons of latex was a far cry from his factory’s output of just 750 tons. Ford retired from the rubber industry in 1945 after losing over $20 million in the Amazon (over $200 million in today’s dollars). The Brazilian government purchased all of Ford’s land for a measly $250,000. Today some of the structures of Fordlândia and Belterra still remain and are marked as spots for Amazon tours.",henry ford utopia week horticulture cultures and civilizations intriguing environs ghost towns ecosystems plants architectural oddities architecture

121,Snake Island (Ilha da Queimada Grande),Brazil,"Off-limits and full of venomous pit vipers, Snake Island's nickname is frighteningly apt.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snake-island-ilha-de-queimada-grande,"Off the shore of Brazil, almost 93 miles away from downtown São Paulo, is Ilha da Queimada Grande, also known as “Snake Island.” The island is untouched by human developers for a very good reason. Researchers estimate that on the island live between one and five snakes per square meter. The snakes live on the many migratory birds (enough to keep the snake density remarkably high) that use the island as a resting point. “Between one and five snakes per square meter” might not be so terrible if the snakes were, say, two inches long and nonvenomous. The snakes on Queimada Grande, however, are a unique species of pit viper, the golden lancehead. The lancehead genus of snakes is responsible for 90 percent of Brazilian snakebite-related fatalities. The golden lanceheads that occupy Snake Island grow to well over half a meter long, and they possess a powerful fast-acting venom that melts the flesh around their bites. The potent venom of this species evolved due to the need for the snake to quickly incapacitate and kill seabirds that land on the island’s trees before they are able to fly away. On an island ecosystem occupied by hundreds of competitors, the deadly venom of the golden lancehead maximizes its potential to feed and survive. Golden lanceheads are so dangerous that, with the exception of some scientific outfits, the Brazilian Navy has expressly forbidden anyone from landing on the island. Locals in the coastal towns near Queimada Grande love to recount two grisly tales of death on Snake Island. In one, a fisherman unwittingly wanders onto the island to pick bananas. Naturally, he is bitten. He manages to return to his boat, where he promptly succumbs to the snake’s venom. He is found sometime later on the boat deck in a great pool of blood. The other story is of the final lighthouse operator and his family. One night, a handful of snakes enter through a window and attack the man, his wife, and their three children. In a desperate gambit to escape, they flee towards their boat, but they are bitten by snakes on branches overhead. Marcelo Duarte, a biologist who has visited Snake Island over 20 times, says that the locals’ claim of one to five snakes per square meter is an exaggeration, though perhaps not by much. One snake per square meter is more like it. Not that that should ease one’s mind: At one snake per meter, you’re never more than three feet away from death.  Presently, reaching the island legally requires the cooperation of the Brazilian Navy. A safer bet is to try to see snakes in mainland Brazil, in captivity. To do this you have three options: Golden lanceheads can legally be seen at the Butantan Institute in São Paulo in the Serpentarium if one asks politely. Alternatively, you could head to the São Paulo zoo where in the snake house you will find an enclosure that contains five adult lanceheads. Your final option is to head to the Zoológico Municipal Quinzinho de Barros in Sorocaba city, state of Sao Paulo, where you can see a very special golden lancehead snake that lives happily in the reptile house.",animal islands snakes islands animals

Every inch of wall at the dense urban crossroads is covered with graffiti and the pieces even extend down onto the sidewalks. Well-known street artists from not only Brazil but also other parts of the world are attracted by this sanctuary of graffiti and come to make their marks, however transient they may be. The street art tradition at the location started in the 80s when the first drawing, one of DC Comics superhero Batman, appeared. Soon more was to follow with fine-arts students painting cubist and psychedelic images along the long walls. Soon Beco do Batman was completely covered in bright, stylized spay paint art. Today the area continues to exist in a state of flux, with old pieces disappearing as new paintings are created on top of them, always with the previous artist’s permission. The ever-changing look and feel of the site makes every visit to Beco do Batman a new and exciting experience.  The closest metro station is Sumaré on the green line. From there it's possible to walk along Av. Paulo VI and then along the north side of Cemitério São Paulo and turn right.

In 1867 the town was the operation headquarters and home for the employees of the English-owned São Paulo Railway. The town’s stone buildings look straight out of a London exurb and a clocktower looms above the jungle mist in the old train yard. The São Paulo Railway carried both people and cargo (mostly coffee) between the interior of São Paulo and the port of Santos. Its greatest technological achievement was the funicular: a train shuttle built specifically for the steep mountain incline. At its peak Paranapiacaba housed 4,000 engineers, laborers, and their families. However, as automated technology rendered the 19th century funicular obsolete, the depot ceased to be as essential for transporting goods down from the mountain and out to the coast. As Brazil grew more interconnected, the São Paulo Railway was bought out by the Brazilian government in the 1940s. The funicular from the Paranapiacaba train station remained in use until 1980, after which it was only run occasionally for tourists. Today, it sits rusting in the train yard. Though the train station may appear broken down and desolate, Paranapiacaba is not abandoned. Around 1,000 people live in the region, but many of the old homes are empty. The village is divided into “upper” and “lower” halves by the train tracks. Vila Portuguesa lays further up the mountain, and as the name suggests, is more Portuguese in architectural style. Downhill sits Vila Martim Smith, where the employees of the railway formerly lived in bunkhouses and small cottages. This is where the Museo Tecnológico Ferroviário sits in an old railway building. The museum exhibits all the technological achievements of the British railway in Brazil, including displays of the 19th century train equipment. The train station is also open for visitors to explore. Although the trains don’t run anymore, the station is anything but dead: The industrial tracks, buildings, and equipment are being taken over by lush natural growth.

126,Chapada das Mesas National Park,"Santa Terezinha, Brazil",High plateaus and beautiful waterfalls frame this ecologically significant nature preserve.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapada-das-mesas-national-park,"Brazil is famous for its Amazonian rain forest, and rightfully so. It is, then, astonishing to learn that the country is home to a whole different unique ecoregion that supports a dazzling array of biodiversity and is threatened by the demands of encroaching economic development. That region is called the Cerrado, and Chapada das Mesas National Park is one of the few parts of it designated for conservation. The Cerrado is a tropical savanna that constitutes 21% of Brazilian territory; among the country’s major habitat types, this makes the Cerrado second only to the Amazonian rain forest in terms of total land area. Making up most of central Brazil, it has been designated by the World Wildlife Fund as the most biologically rich savanna in the world, boasting an incredibly heterogeneous range of plant and animal life with remarkable high levels of endemism (i.e., incidence of species found only in that place). In the mid-20th century, the Cerrado was identified as a prime region for economic expansion in Brazil, thanks to the development of new agricultural techniques that could render fertile land that had theretofore been considered unfit for cultivation. Starting in the 1960s, enormous amounts of lime were dumped on newly-cleared fields in the Cerrado to neutralize the acidic soil. Encouraged over the following decades by government policies, growing urban demand, and a rising population expanding into previously, principally indigenous areas, today the Cerrado is a source of major agricultural production in Brazil, contributing 70% of the country’s beef and providing enormous amounts of soy and charcoal (i.e., trees chopped down to make room for all this other stuff, and turned into fuel for the steel industry), among other products. This rapid and increasing transformation of the Cerrado has seen very little counterbalance in terms of conservation efforts; the biome is not designated by the Brazilian government as a National Heritage, and currently only 1.5% of the region is federally protected. Thus Chapada das Mesas National Park — like the plateaus it is named after — is a striking, lonely island in the midst of a diverse and shifting landscape. Created only in 2005 and consisting of 160,046 hectares (395,482 acres), Chapada das Mesas isn’t easy to reach, but treats its intrepid visitors to gorgeous waterfalls, crystal clear natural pools, and an untouched pocket of a unique and enormous ecological mosaic.",fauna flora waterfalls rock formations rivers parks water plants animals

At a stunning growth rate of six inches per day, this waterlily is a shocking display of botanic wonder. The leaves are said to be strong enough to support a human, and can grow up to seven feet in diameter. Because of the conditions needed for the Victoria amazonica to grow, they are rarely found to survive more than a year outside of the Amazon. They thrive in hot, humid weather, and as the waters in the Amazon rise and fall, the stems must grow to keep up with the change. In addition to magnificent leaves, the flowers that are produced bloom in the night blooming and scent the air.

128,Curitiba Botanical Gardens,"Curitiba, Brazil",Solitary monument dedicated to the beauty of nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/curitiba-botanical-gardens,"The Curitiba Botanical Gardens look like something out of a lost age. Constructed in 1991 to resemble French royal gardens, the entire grounds are drenched in luxurious elegance. Flowers line the pathways to the Botanical Garden as visitors enter the gates toward the greenhouse. Each hedge is constructed carefully, and successfully channels the gardens of Versailles’s backyard. The greenhouse itself is the highlight of the gardens, set gracefully against the backdrop of Curitiba’s skyline. The greenhouse is not impressive in size. It is only a hair over 450 square meters. However, its design is so arresting it steals the eye of any visitor who explores the garden. It is an art nouveau construction, employing metal and glass to sculpt its three peaks into a solitary monument dedicated to the beauty of nature. White metal wraps around the entire structure, carving out an intricate design across the greenhouse and truly setting the building apart from the rest of the similarly striking gardens. Like the greenhouse settled within it, the park is not enormous, but it is unique in some sense. While most lavish botanical gardens are created in a climate that cannot support its flora, many of the plants in the Curitiba Botanical Gardens are culled from the local vegetation. Due to this, the wooden botanical museum that snakes behind the greenhouse has attracted researchers to the area since its creation. It is open to the general public everyday and an ideal place to take a break from the fast-paced city life in Curitiba.

The Coffee Palace was where that money was made. Inaugurated in 1914 in the coastal town of Santos, the Brazilian “Palace of the Official Coffee Stock Exchange” was where the price of these coffee beans was determined. In effect, it was the financial center of Brazil, the coffee version of New York’s Stock Exchange. It remained an active trading floor until 1950. This wealth generated by coffee is clearly reflected in the grandness of the nicknamed “Coffee Palace.” The building is topped with a 120-ft tall clock tower while Ceres, goddess of agriculture, and Mercury, god of commerce, look out from either side of the entrance. Inside, the opulence continues with an elaborate stained glass ceiling, inlaid marble floors, and a table made from jacaranda wood in the trader’s room. The two floor Coffee Museum housed within has scales, sacks, tasting tables, photography, and dioramas depicting the earlier era. Downstairs there is a cafe where you can sample coffees from around Brazil.  Well located in the central region of the city. The coffee shop closes on Sundays and the museum closes on Mondays.

Some also break world records, such as Gruta Casa de Pedra, the largest cave opening in the world. At about 705 feet high, the giant cave portal is impressive and majestic. It’s so huge that it could easily swallow up Trump Tower, a 58-story skyscraper. Gruta Casa de Pedra (“House of Stone Cave) is located within Brazil’s Parque Estadual Turístico do Alto Ribeira (PETAR), a world heritage site that’s simply dazzling. A visit will reveal encrusted limestone, rivers and waterfalls, dunes, curious geological formations, pristine natural pools, a biodiverse reserve of fauna and flora, and horizons playing with the infinite. The national park was created to protect the mountainous area of the lush Atlantic rainforest. It has more than 350 caves (only a handful are open to visitors), making it one of the largest cave concentrations in the world. The caverns are a rare beauty among the luxurious green of the Atlantic rainforest, a geological gem for nature lovers and photographers as well as spelunkers. Casa da Pedra is not the most visited cave in the park, but for those that make the trek, the spectacle is well worth it. The record-size portal lights the main hall of the cavern, which stretches over 9,500 feet long. A strong river runs through part of the cavern floor, while the steep sides are lined with large stalactites and stalagmites that are hundreds of years old. The cave opening is located close to the Casa da Pedra núcleo (visitors center), one of four visitors centers within the national park. It’s about a 10-mile drive from the colonial village of Iporanga to the center, on a dirt road crossing several wooden bridges. From the visitors center, you can take a hiking trail (accompanied by a local guide) toward the Caboclos núcleo, which passes by the cave entrance.

131,Maned Wolves of Santuário do Caraça,"Catas Altas, Brazil",This neo-Gothic monastery offers a rare chance to witness the unique maned wolf right up close.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maned-wolves-of-santuario-do-caraca,"Sitting under the night sky on the steps of this atmospheric neo-Gothic monastery, you may witness the beauty of the maned wolf at extremely close quarters. For those lucky enough to encounter one of these rare creatures, it’s a surreal and unforgettable experience. The unique relationship between the residents of the Santuário do Caraça monastery and the area’s native maned wolves began in the early 1980s. Monks started to notice that an apparently large and strong animal was habitually raiding the church’s trashcans by tipping them over and dragging out the contents for clandestine midnight feasts. Eventually, an intrigued and somewhat frustrated seminarian decided to wait up during the twilight hours of the morning to find out what was causing the mess. To his surprise, he encountered a tall and lanky canine creature with red fur, the gait of a deer, and Mickey Mouse-like ears, chowing down on kitchen scraps in the church courtyard. The animal was a maned wolf, which, despite the name, is not an actual wolf. In fact, the unique animal more closely resembles a fox with very long legs and is the tallest wild canine. The maned wolf is a primitive canid species native to South America, which early Iberian colonists thought resembled the wolf of the Old World. But unlike the fierce North American and Eurasian wolves that occasionally make humans their prey, the maned wolf is a shy and inoffensive creature incapable of hunting large prey, feeding mainly on fruit and rodents. Partly to enjoy the spectacle of this strange creature, and partly in order to stop the nightly rubbish bin banditry, the monks began to leave scraps of meat out in the open. This tradition has now taken place every night for the last 30 years. Generations of maned wolves have served an important role as ambassadors for their species, as sightings by visitors help increase awareness about protecting these threatened animals and conserving their habitat. Nowadays the monks feed the maned wolves of Caraça with a specially formulated and balanced meal that has been suggested by zootechnics, vets, and conservation biologists. Subsequent studies conducted by ecologists have shown that this does not negatively impact or alter either their natural behavior or ecological function in the wild.  Needless to say, these are not “trained” or “tame” animals, and their wildness has always been respected. As a visitor, you can make a pilgrimage to this 17th-century monastery and spend the night sitting on the steps of the church beneath the stony eyes of a sculpture of the Virgin Mary, watching the antics of these beguiling creatures as they feed on the terrace under a starry sky.  The best way of getting to Santuário do Caraça other than by car is by first heading to the town of Santa Barbara, which can be reached by taking a relatively comfortable ""oni-bus"" from the bus terminal of the city of Belo Horizonte, capital of Minas Gerais state. (It may take a little over two hours by bus to get to town depending on traffic.) Once you have arrived in Santa Barbara a taxi ride up to the winding roads up the hills to the Santuario will set you back 50 to 60 Reias. Please be respectful to the wolves by following the advice of the church, and not disturbing the animals with unnecessary loud noises, sudden movements, or attempting to touch them, as they are animals susceptible to stress. Also please be respectful of the historic surroundings of the monastery and the people living and working there, who do a fantastic job at conserving this wonderful site, its natural areas, and its wildlife.",wolves endangered animals monasteries churches sacred spaces animals
132,Hotel Unique,"São Paulo, Brazil",A huge boat-shaped hotel with a blood red pool and other oddities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-unique,"Sitting in the Jardins District of São Paulo, Brazil, is a towering 80-meter ship that would fit better in an ocean than a residential neighborhood. This giant inverted arch, complete with porthole-shaped windows, is the peculiar Hotel Unique, which welcomes guests aboard to a boat-shaped modernist fantasy. Known locally as “The Watermelon,” the strange half-moon crescent shape of Hotel Unique is one of the lodging’s main draws, and it greatly influences the shape of its rooms. The hotel’s designer, Ruy Ohtake, takes full advantage of the oddly slanted walls by artistically placing TV sets on the slant and extending tables to reach the edge of the curvature, despite the uneven ground beneath them. Just as fascinating as the rooms’ angled slants is the rooftop terrace, which features a gourmet restaurant and a panoramic view of South America’s largest city. Atop the terrace is a blood red outdoor pool, complete with underwater music. In the lobby, one can find a large blue circular cushion and a 15-tier stack of liquor bottles. On both the inside and out, Hotel Unique seems to live up to its name. The closest metro station is Brigadeiro (on the green line), but it's far enough that its advisable to take a cab or a bus instead of going on foot. The Skye bar in the rooftop terrace is open to non-guests everyday until midnight and it's generally easy to access.",pools ships places to stay hotels architectural oddities architecture

The park is compromised of 146 hectares of predominantly Atlantic forest, giving the visitor an idea of what the area looked like before the arrival of the Portuguese. A series of both large and small ponds contain a variety of flowering waterlilies, including the famous Giant water lily of the Amazon, whilst a stream can be followed all the way to its source in the jungle. The two large glass houses in the center of the gardens showcase flora from the dominant Brazilian biomes: the Cerrado and the Atlantic forest and the detailed educational displays reveal their ecology and the importance of their conservation.  An orchidarium displays strikingly colorful orchids while a small botanical museum can also be found close by displaying interesting specimens and chronicling the history of the gardens. The botanical garden is not just about plants but is also a wonderful place to watch wildlife. Charismatic bird species like the green-billed toucan, maroon bellied parakeet and the blonde crested woodpecker are very conspicuous as they flit through the trees to feed on fruits whilst reptiles such as the tegu lizard and freshwater turtles can also be seen swimming around the many waterlily pools. As you walk, you may also glimpse boa constrictors in the undergrowth on some of the wilder trails. The garden is also home to many mammal species such as howler monkeys, agoutis, marmoset monkeys, armadillos, and sloths.  The Botanical Garden is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. from Tuesday to Sunday and the entrance fee costs R$10 but you only need to pay R$5 if you are a student from Brazil or abroad and carrying documentation of studies. To get there, take a bus from Saúde or São Judas metro stations, both on the blue line, or from metro terminal station Parque D. Pedro II, on the red line.If looking for the parks howler monkeys, the best place to see them is in the garden on the ""Trilha dos Bugios"" or ""Trail of the Howler Monkeys"" where they often give themselves away through their frequent riotous territorial roaring. It's best not to stand directly underneath the trees where they hang out though as there is a strong chance of being defecated on.If looking for sloths, the best place to see them is also in ""Trilha dos Bugios."" The sloths tend to be very visible in the canopies and tree branches due to their slow movements. Just look for a hairy lump amongst the trees and it is probably a sloth having a siesta. If you do encounter a sloth please resist the temptation of stroking them or trying to pick them up, as they are not fond of being handled and you are likely to get injured by their very sharp claws.",

After purchasing the land from the hoodwinked owner, the mayor, only a few days later, sent in a proposal to build in the site, which was immediately accepted. After personally inaugurating the Niterói, bumping the surrounding land up astronomically in price, they then sold the property what would equate to over $2,000,000 US currency.

It may not be near the ocean, but there is water everywhere, thanks to its altitude. Deep, green canyons winds between spectacular rock formations. Just east of the national park, in the drier and desolate Nova Redenção, there’s magic hidden underground. Discovered in 1920 during a quest for diamonds in the region, the Poço Azul or Gruta Azul (also known as the “Blue Pool,” “Blue Pit,” or “Blue Well”) is the largest submerged paleontological site in Brazil. In 2005, fossils of various animals were found at more than 500 feet deep. Fourteen different species were identified, notably a near-complete skeleton of a 20-foot-long ground sloth that lived in all the Americas until about 11,000 years ago. To get there, you descend hundreds of feet down wooden stairs. Between winter and autumn, due to the position of the sun, natural light penetrates the cave. Passing through the white rocks, bright rays color the water below a spectacular turquoise blue. Deep in the still, clear, mineral-laden water, one can clearly see rocks and tree trunks at the bottom. Don’t confuse the Blue Pool with the nearby larger and deeper Poço Encantado (Enchanted Pool), as it looks very similar. The major difference is that since the 1990s, visitors aren’t allowed to swim in that one anymore. That’s because, unlike in the Blue Pool which has flowing water, the Poço Encantado’s water is still and might be polluted by swimmers, damaging its natural beauty.  Locating the cave can be a little complicated, so many tourists choose to hire a guide or take an organized trip from Lençois. There’s a restaurant at the site and the ability to rent a lifejacket, mask, and snorkel. Visitors must take a quick shower to protect the cave against body fats being introduced to the well. During high season, between February and October, visitors might have to wait in long lines. The best time to see the sunlight is between 12:30 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. The fee is R$30.00 per person, including rent of lifejacket, mask, and snorkel.",pools caves ecosystems water

It is hard to say where it began, but many point towards two sisters and their friend who said they saw a “creature” with a thin body, strange V-shaped feet, and large red eyes walking the streets of the city. Rumors spread quickly throughout the city. Within a day, more UFOs were supposedly sighted, and other reports of alien sightings and even captured aliens came flooding into the local media. Two days later, a “creature” was reported to have been found dead in a roadside ditch. Three military trucks were reportedly sent to retrieve it. The Brazilian media went wild for the story, though it was impossible to verify any part of it. The story even became international news, with the Wall Street Journal writing that “Varginha has the makings of a ‘cosmic Watergate.’” Despite all the press coverage, there was never any proof that anything out of the ordinary was afoot, beyond a self-instigated mass media frenzy. The Brazilian government denies the entire incident ever happened, which of course only makes UFO believers even more suspicious. Since then Varginha has become a UFO pilgrimage spot – the South American equivalent of Roswell, New Mexico – and the city has been more than happy to capitalize on its sudden influx of ET tourism. Grey dolls can be bought throughout the city, and businesses have added alien decor. The largest and most conspicuous of the UFO-related items in the city is its water tower. Constructed in 2001, it is 20 meters tall and built to resemble the craft which was said to have been seen by the city residents.

After uprooting the settled and native populations on Anchieta Island, the construction of the prison facility began. Room was made for guards and their families in addition to the cell blocks which were built to house the criminal element from off-shore Sao Paulo. At first the inmates were the standard variety of offenders, most of whom lived on the site in the fashion of a prison colony, but by the late 1920s more and more political prisoners were being moved to the site. The prison operated fairly without incident until 1952 when the inmates staged a violent rebellion that left countless guards and inmates dead and wounded. After the riot, the remaining detainees were transferred to other facilities and the Anchieta Island prison was closed, leaving the prison buildings to crumble and be retaken by nature. Today Anchieta Island is a popular stop for tourists visiting Sao Paulo. The lush nature that covers the island is the main attraction, but the abandoned prison site is also still accessible. In fact the very nature that brings so many visitors to the island is turning the old buildings into picturesque ruins as the plants reclaim the site.

Beloved Brazilian politician Antonio Albano Reis conceived of the park as a massive, eclectic attraction that would have had multiple fantastic areas in a variety of themes and genres. The sprawling complex, which covered over 38 million square meters, the equivalent of 460 football fields, was to contain a Santa park (in honor of Reis himself, who was known as the “Santa Claus of Quintino” thanks to his habit of dressing up as Santa each year), water slides, a replica Old West town, a concert hall, and even a ten-story tower meant to evoke the famous Christ the Redeemer. Work began on the many attractions in 2000 but Reis was tragically killed in an automobile accident just meters from the entrance of the park (either the victim of murder or a random crash with a European tourist). While a great deal of work had been started on such features as the Wild West town and some of the water slides, only the Santa Park was ever completed.  After being opened to the public for a few short years, the entire site was closed and with Reis no longer at the helm of the project, the entire site was left to decay as family, government, and investors tied up the park’s future in bureaucracy. Today, the expansive Cidade Albanoel sits dormant and the completed attractions are slowly being taken over by rust and undergrowth.

The genesis of this contemporary memento mori, titled La Madone de São Paulo, came in 2015 through an artistic collaboration between the Puerto Rican artist Alexis Diaz and the Chilean artist INTI. It was created for the first international O.bra Festival, a collective art project that aims to bring mind-blowing art to urban settings. The mural was created in time for the Brazilian All Saints’ Day on November 2, 2015. The holiday is an equivalent of the Day of the Dead, which although not as spectacular as it is in its birthplace of Mexico is still an important annual celebration for Brazilians. Since then the mural has been reminding passersby of the inextricable march of time and of their own mortality, in a Latino life-affirming street art kind of way, and it is hoped it will continue to do so for many years more. Note that it is not a good idea to visit the area at night as there is some considerable risk of being mugged. If you do decide to go to see the mural after dark then go in a group, be aware of your surroundings and be careful. A much better idea is to take a visit during the day when there is a stronger police presence in the area and it is generally safer.The mural is located in the downtown area of Anhangabaú, which translates to ""water of the bad spirit"" in Tupi, the now-extinct language of the indigenous people of the region.

Filled with hundreds of his statues, paintings and ceramics, his workshop complex is a vast labor of love and artistic imagining of the world, which harkens lovingly back to a childhood spent in Recife. Born into a wealthy family in the northern Brazilian city in 1927, Brennand began his love of pottery and art at a young age. While he was just a boy, he was already working in the family pottery studio in Recife, that his father had founded in 1917. As his skill grew, he jetted off to Europe for inspiration, studying the works of Gaudi and Picasso while travelling throughout Spain and Italy. When he returned to Recife in 1971, his family studio was in ruin and he set his sights on restoring the workshop that had nurtured his young love of ceramics and art. Combining his talents with landscape designer and architect Roberto Brule Marx, Brennand began developing an immense art compound, complete with extensive gardens, temples and reflecting pools. The area comprising the workshop features massive galleries holding Brennand’s works and most famously feature a lush outdoor promenade. Many of the structures in the sculpture garden are influenced by Brennand’s work with ceramics and the walls of his promenade are lined with statues he composed as well. The entire complex is a reimagining of his family’s studio, and the great detail and beauty reflect the inspiration he drew from his formative years spent sculpting under the guidance of his father. Along with Francisco Brennand’s Ceramic Workshop, his works can be found in another museum located in Recife as well.

Since then, he has travelled to Spain, and upon seeing Gaudí’s work first-hand, has agreed the resemblance is real. The house was discovered by chance by an architecture student who happened to walk past it. From then on, it has attracted visitors of all kinds, curious to see its tile mosaic surfaces and walk through its maze-like corridors filled with various kinds of objects. Located in one of the city's favelas, it is not easily accessible to visitors intending to go on their own. Still, this location is part of the Paraisópolis das Artes guided tour. Organized by Nova Paraisópolis, a local organization focused on revitalizing Paraisópolis, these tours include visits to multiple other art-relevant places in the favela and must be previously scheduled.",eccentric homes homes
144,Insano Body Slide,"Aquiraz, Brazil",From 135 feet high riders plunge down the world's tallest freestanding body slide at 65 mph.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/insano-body-slide,"Insano, the crown jewel of Brazil’s giant water park, Beach Park, is the tallest freestanding body slide in the world. Daring riders freefall from the top—about the height of a 14-story building—to the bottom of the steep drop at speeds of up to 65 mph. Built in 1989, the 135-foot-high ride held the Guinness record for the world’s tallest water slide up until 1999, when it was beat out by the 193-foot Kilimanjaro in Rio de Janeiro. Still, Insano does justice to its name by being the tallest freestanding body slide and is certainly one of the most radical rides of the planet. It’s located in a water park with superlatives of its own: Beach Park is the largest aquatic park in South America and one of the largest in the world. It has all you need to enjoy Brazil’s hot sunny days: rides, pools, saunas, ecological walks, artificial rapids or the beloved Insano, the water slide as tall as a 14-story building.

145,Giant Anteaters of Serra da Canastra,"São Roque de Minas, Brazil",This breathtaking national park is one of the best places to see the weird and wonderful giant anteater in the wild.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giant-anteaters-of-serra-da-canastra,"The wonderfully unique giant anteater is an endangered species that is disappearing from many regions of Brazil. But there are still wild areas where this strange species clings on to survival and can be seen easily. One of the best places in the country to observe these bizarre beasts is in the magnificent Serra da Canastra National Park in the state of Minas Gerais. Serra Da Canastra has been a national park since 1972 and comprises an area of 72,000 acres of Cerrado savanna, hills, and forest, through which the São Francisco river flows. Highly biodiverse, over 350 species of animal live in the park and many rare and endangered plant species such as orchids are found here too. Still the real highlight of the park is undoubtedly its large mammal species, and especially the giant anteater. This large creature may be seen very easily as it ambles on its knuckles through the long grass in search of its prey using its strange elongated snout to detect nearby anthills to raid. When visiting the park, you’re likely to see an anteater feed using its sharp claws to break open an anthill and its extraordinary long tongue to extract the insects. If you are really lucky, you may even see a mother anteater with her baby clinging to her back. Other endangered species may also be observed here, such as the pampas deer, maned wolf, puma, pampas cat, rhea ostrich, giant armadillo, and the critically endangered Brazilian merganser duck. But these are much harder and more time-consuming to find than the anteater, and will typically make seasonal movements to less accessible areas of the reserve. (If you want to stand a good chance of seeing these creatures it’s best to plan the timing of your visit in advance with the animals’ seasonal behavior patterns in mind.) Serra Da Canastra is also an area of astounding landscapes with many trails to explore. A particularly famous natural landmark is the Casca D’Anta waterfall, which is over 610 feet tall and a renowned site of tranquility and enchanting natural beauty. The park is also home to many curious prehistoric rock formations that form eerie shapes. They are best seen at the Curral de Pedras and Garagem de Pedras sites.  You will need a guide to enter the national park and there are several available with offices in Sao Roque de Minas. There are plenty of options for accomodation in the town too, including hotels, hostels, and eco-lodges. A pair of decent binoculars (magnification size 8 x 20 is best ) is a must have if you plan on observing the animals. For photographs bring a long lens for your camera. Always watch the animals at a respectful distance and particularly in the case of the giant anteater, which may attack if it feels threatened. Be especially vigilant when walking through areas with long grass, as the park is home to several species of highly venomous snakes. Please be responsible and dont leave any litter that could harm animals or drop anything that could potentially start a wildfire in the reserve. Bring a raincoat or light jacket as rainstorms can roll in deceptively quickly and can be torrential. Sunblock, a hat, and mosquito repellent are also recommended.",wildlife sanctuaries endangered animals wildlife waterfalls rock formations national parks conservation water nature animals
146,Teatro Amazonas in Manaus,"Manaus, Brazil",A beautiful opera house in the heart of Amazonia has recently restarted performances after a 90-year hiatus.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/teatro-amazonas-manaus,"The turn of 20th century was a wondrous era for the Amazonian region of Brazil. Flush with money from exports from its rubber plantations, the region flourished–particularly the capital city of Manaus. Here wealthy rubber barons tried to recreate the lavish lifestyle of the European elite, and what better way to do so than with an opera house, built in the middle of the rain forest: the Teatro Amazonas. Construction began in 1884, under the supervision of Italian architect Celestial Sacardim. No expense was spared: roofing came from Alsace, furniture from Paris, marble from Italy, and steel from England. On the outside of the building, the dome was covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the Brazilian national flag. The inside was decorated by Italian painter Domenico de Angelis. The first performance was given on January 7, 1897, with the famous Enrico Caruso singing. Some say that entire opera house was built just to lure him to this remote corner of the world, so that the rich rubber barons of Manaus could hear him sing. With the invention of artificial rubber, Manaus lost its main source of income. The wealthy left town, and the opera house closed down. There wasn’t a single performance in Teatro Amazonas for 90 years, excepting its cameo appearance in Werner Herzog’s movie Fitzcarraldo. But in 2001 the new populist government of the province decided it would try to revive the glory of the Teatro Amazonas, allocating 1.5 million pounds a year for this task (in a province where 60 percent of the population is poverty stricken and illiterate). The plan worked and the Teatro Amazonas has become the home of an unlikely musical scene. Tempted by the promise of high salaries, many of the best musicians from impoverished countries, especially those of Eastern Europe, decided to move to Brazil to perform at the Teatro Amazonas. Today, 39 of the 54-member Amazon Philharmonic orchestra are from Bulgaria, Belarus and Russia. The theater is also the location of an annual film festival.",outsider architecture
147,Cathedral of Brasília,"Brasília, Brazil",A stunning Catholic cathedral built by a curve-loving communist in Brazil’s newly created capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-of-brasilia,"Designed by the acclaimed Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, the Cathedral of Brasília is an almost crown-like hyperboloid structure that appears pinned to the ground. The building’s appearance, with its striking shape and gorgeous stained glass ceiling, is just as intriguing as its history. The cornerstone for the Cathedral of Brasília was laid in September 1958. The main frame of the cathedral was completed two years later, but then, as with many construction projects in Brasília at that time, everything ground to a halt. President Juscelino Kubitschek was overseeing the construction of Brasília, Brazil’s new capital, when his term ended in 1961. Construction stalled on numerous projects, including the cathedral. To get things moving again, the cathedral was handed over to the Catholic Church, despite Kubitschek’s initial idea of creating a state-funded and interdenominational cathedral open to all faiths. Construction continued anew. The cathedral was consecrated in 1968, albeit without a roof, and finally opened to the public in 1970. It became one of many works in Brasília by Oscar Niemeyer, who, on this project, was ably assisted by the Brazilian architect and urban planner, Lúcio Costa. Both men, incidentally, were known communists. Due to his political beliefs, Niemeyer was forced into exile following the start of the military dictatorship of Brazil in 1964, not long after he designed the cathedral. Years later, from 1992 to 1996, he served as the president of the Brazilian Communist Party. The Cathedral of Brasília is undeniably an impressive sight. Its exterior is dominated by 16 curved concrete columns (Niemeyer loved curves), each weighing 90 tons. These curve inwards, meeting briefly before branching back outwards and upwards to give the structure its hyperboloid, or hourglass, shape. It bears some resemblance to a white crown, or crown of thorns, in this case rising up to a height of about 131 feet. Near the entrance to the cathedral stand four bronze sculptures representing the Four Evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each is about 9.8 feet tall. Inside the cathedral’s spacious interior hang three angel sculptures by Alfredo Ceschiatti and Dante Croce. These range from 7.3 feet to 14 feet tall and hang above the nave of the cathedral. Above them is the cathedral’s colorful stained-glass ceiling, composed of a series of 98-feet-high triangles. Other notable elements of the Cathedral of Brasília include its altar, which was donated by Pope Paul VI. The four bells in the cathedral’s bell tower, meanwhile, were donated by Spain. The stark concrete bell tower stands just outside the cathedral. As for architect Oscar Niemeyer, he died on December 5, 2012, in a hospital in Rio de Janeiro. He was just 10 days shy of his 105th birthday. His BBC obituary included the following: “Rejecting the cube shapes favoured by his modernist predecessors, Niemeyer built some of the world’s most striking buildings – monumental, curving concrete and glass structures which almost defy description.” The Cathedral of Brasília, in a nutshell.",communist architecture stained-glass windows communism religion churches sacred spaces architecture
148,Museu da Tatuagem de São Paulo,"São Paulo, Brazil",Brazil's only museum dedicated to the art and evolution of tattoos.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museu-da-tatuagem,"Despite its location in a historic building in the heart of São Paulo’s city center, the Museu da Tatuagem is little known relative to the wealth of museums and galleries around town. Those who do stop in for a visit are rarely disappointed. São Paulo’s Tattoo Museum is a celebration of body art, covering the history and evolution of tattoos in Brazil and beyond. Among the collection of more than 500 items are photos, paintings, sculptures, and intriguing objects like ancient tools and DIY machines made in Brazilian and Russian prisons. The museum was founded in 2004 during the first ever São Paulo Tattoo Festival by one of the city’s pioneer tattoo artists, Elcio Sespede, also known as Polaco. It has become a renowned tattoo shop, drawing plenty of inspiration from the gritty streets and creativity of São Paulo. In his collection, Polaco focus on how cultures use tattoos to represent who they are and what distinguishes them socially. There is also an interesting overview of what tattoos represented worldwide and in Brazilian culture throughout the decades. The museum devotes a display to the first tattoo artist in Brazil, Knud Harald Lykke Gregersen, better known as “Lucky Tattoo,” who arrived in Brazil in 1959 and introduced electric machines to the country. A visit will stay with you whether or not you decide this will be the day you’ll finally get a tattoo.

149,Ilha Fiscal,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",This Brazilian palace island was once the site of the last grand ball before revolution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ilha-fiscal,"This island and its fairytale-like palace, which once housed the offices of the Guarda Fiscal in Rio de Janeiro, serve as a reminder of a time when the city was the capital of the Brazilian Empire. Located in Guanabara Bay, Ilha Fiscal is an island that was used by the local government to build a palace that would serve as the offices of the Brazilian customs authority. The building was devised by Pedro II of Brazil who commissioned his engineer, Adolfo José del Vecchio to develop the project. The works resulted in a small palace inspired by the works of French architect Viollet-le-Duc with a Gothic-Provence style, it was inaugurated on April 27th, 1889 in a ceremony attended by the Emperor and several foreign guests. The palace itself served as the scene for the last ball offered by the imperial government some months later, on November 9th. The event was planned to celebrate the silver anniversary of Princess Isabel and the Count of Eu. Some (fairly questionable) sources state that between 3,000 to 5,000 people were invited to the party and that the extravagant celebration was fueled by national resources originally intended to sustain the victims of a severe drought in the northeastern state of Ceará. Six days after the Ball, the monarchy was overthrown by a military and political alliance giving birth to the Republic of Brazil. Some later accounts tell the story of a boat passing by the island with Del Vecchio and some other republican supporters and officials on board. When one of the passengers remarked that the coat of arms of the fallen empire was still present in the façade of the palace and that it should be destroyed in order to remove any imperial symbols on republican buildings, Del Vecchio convinced his fellow passengers that the coat of arms was made by an old craftsman who was blind and living in poverty, asking that the sculpture not be removed nor destroyed, a pledge that was surprisingly honored. Today, the palace is home to a museum, but it has lost little of its extravagant style. Boats leave from Espaço Cultural da Marinha at Av.

151,Museu de Arte de São Paulo,"São Paulo, Brazil",This singular art museum in São Paulo is unique inside and out.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museu-de-arte-de-sao-paulo,"The Museu de Arte de São Paulo, or MASP for short, is not your ordinary art museum. Not only is it a modernist architectural marvel—a giant glass box suspended over concrete supported by four bright red beams—it also doesn’t follow any particular layout, and therefore allows you to meander the gallery making your own ontological journey through the world of art. This lack of structure combined with the museum’s enormous collection, which is known as the most impressive collection of Western art in Latin America, makes for a rare experience. You can at one moment contemplate the visage of a fearsome Chinese Tang Dynasty tomb guardian, ponder inscrutable African Yoruba fetishes, then study an ethereal sculpture of an ancient Roman goddess. At another moment you may be immersed in the hallucinatory and nightmarish vision of Hieronymus Bosch and in yet another be spellbound by a sublime sunset and landscape painting by Vincent van Gogh. MASP was designed by the Italian-born architect Lina Bo Bardi, who moved to Brazil in 1946 and spent the rest of her life immersed in Brazilian culture and design. The massive concrete and glass space was constructed between 1956 and 1968. Many of the paintings on display are beautiful examples of baroque art from Renaissance-era Italy, Spain, and Portugal, while others are from later eras of artistic innovation, such as works by artists of the Dutch Golden Age or the English Romantics. Also displayed are impressionist and modernist masterpieces of the 19th and 20th centuries, by European greats such as Amedeo Modigliani, Edouard Manet, Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste-Renoir, Paul Gauguin, and Francis Bacon. But it’s not just European art that is showcased here. There are also many works by Mexican artists such as Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco, and the great Brazilian artists such as the haunting social realist paintings of Candido Portinari and the vivacious and sensual works of Emiliano di Cavalcanti. While the vibrant and evocative design of the museum’s exterior has become a landmark of the city, it ought not to overshadow the extraordinary collection housed inside.  MASP is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. from Wednesday to Sunday (closed Mondays) and entrance costs 15 reais. Tuesdays are the best time to visit as the museum stays open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and entrance is free.",art museum paintings museums and collections art museums architecture

It feels like a small slice of the jungle, conveniently placed within São Paulo. Numerous trails wind around the park. The paths lead you among all kinds of native species of palms and trees such as the iron wood, jequitibá, zebra wood, Nectaranda, and of course the “Pau Brasil” (the Brasilwood tree), which the country is named after. The park is also home to a surprising variety of native wildlife. Over 29 species of birds have been reported within the park, including numerous hummingbirds and even parrots such as the white-eyed parakeet and the maroon-bellied parakeet. There are also some resident two-toed sloths; however, these are much harder to see due to the dense foliage. You’ll find some human-made attractions, too. A number of sculptures with a Greco-Roman theme, such as a sublime dryad and a surreal faun, are sprinkled throughout the park. There are also benches where you can hunker down with a book or simply sit and watch the world go by.  One of the entrances of the park is located on the main avenue of São Paulo, directly opposite the Museum of Art of São Paulo Assis Chateaubriand (MASP). This makes it a perfect place to visit after seeing the paintings of Van Gogh, Renoir, Bacon and Bosch at the MASP, or just to get back in contact with nature after having a stroll in the city.

Santo Daime, the religion that has made its home in Boca do Acre, was founded in 1930 by a Brazilian man who saw the Virgin Mary during an experience with the psychoactive vine Ayahuasca. Following his vision, he began formulating new religious views, which became Santo Daime. Daime, in Portuguese means “give me,” which accurately reflects a religion based on deriving strength and love from one’s environment. When Santo Daime was first introduced, there were no spiritual texts, and many of the followers were illiterate. Instead, the religion relied on hymnal prayer and the consumption of “Daime,” or a brew made from Ayahuasca. The hallucinogenic experience is aimed at giving the user clarity and peace of mind. Since its inception, the religion has gained a steady stream of followers in both Brazil, and across the world. There are even adherents to Santo Daime in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, its popularization has also brought demonization in the legal system of many countries. Since Ayahuasca contains an illicit compound, its use in religious ceremony is extremely controversial. However, recent court cases in the United States have essentially legalized its use in religious ceremony. Aside from its supposed religious effects, a number of researchers have used Boca do Acre and Santo Daime as a launch point into the study of Ayahuasca’s medicinal benefits. Current research focuses greatly on the treatment of substance abuse with the drug, and results thus far have been varied and inconclusive.

About 10 kilometers outside of the Brazilian city of Manaus is the site known as the Meeting of Waters (Encontro das Águas). Here, the dark waters of the aptly-named Rio Negro encounter the sandy upper Amazon, known as the Rio Solimões. Although the rivers converge, they do not mix. Instead, they snake stubbornly alongside each other for nearly four miles, forming a polychrome boundary that is visible from space. Geologist Robert Meade described the scale of the Meeting of Waters as “Six Mississippis worth of café-au-lait colored water […] converging here with two Mississippis worth of black-tea-colored water.” The coffee-like coloring of the Solimões is due to the various sediments (sand, mud, silt) it accrues running down from the Andes. In contrast, the Negro carries very little sediment – its dark, tea-like color is primarily caused by dissolved plant matter. It runs slower and is about 6 degrees Celsius warmer than the Solimões, whose swifter, cooler, denser waters rebuff the smaller river’s invitation, making it difficult for their flows to merge. When the two rivers eventually sync up and come together to form the impressive Lower Amazon, there’s a good ways left to go. The River Sea, as it is aptly called, continues across the continent. And although it will encounter several more tributaries along its route to the Atlantic Ocean, the Meeting of Waters remains the encounter to see.

The natural pool formed at the base of the waterfall has a reddish tint to it, due to the highly ferrous water in that region of Minas Gerais. Visitors are informed by residents of the nearby Lapinha da Serra village that the pool is fine for swimming, but to rush back if rain starts. The rising water level will render one of the rivers on the way too deep to cross, which can leave visitors marooned until the levels drop again. From the village, it’s about a 4.35-mile hike to get to the waterfall, which can be covered in around 1.5 to 3 hours depending on your pace. The watery wonder used to be accessible by canoe, but a nearby dam made the water level on the main river too low to navigate by boat. Hiking is the way to reach the falls, but mountain biking could cut the traveling time shorter.  You can get directions from the villagers in Lapinha da Serra, but the route is pretty straightforward. Once you get to the starting point in the village, you just need to follow the paths and trails most visible on the ground. You will have to cross through several private properties, which is fine. This is not trespassing (since these are private natural reserve patrimony), as long as you stay on the path. On the way you will find and cross unlocked gates. These are the limits on each of the properties. Count seven of these gates and keep going. Follow the path and the sound of water falling, and after a couple of hills, you will reach Cachoeira do Lajeado.

159,Penedo,"Penedo, Brazil","This ""Little Finland"" started as a Finnish utopian society in Eastern Brazil.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/penedo-itatiaia,"In the minds of many Finns in the early 20th century, “Tropical Fever” was not an illness, but the cure. It was the idea that warmer, less developed, more natural places were the healthiest in the world. It was with this in mind that Toivo Uuskallio travelled with his family to Brazil in the late 1920s, and eventually established Penedo as a vegan utopian society. The idea was to live immersed in nature and free of religious and political turmoil and health issues associated with smoking and drinking alcohol. The chosen natural environment was Itatiaia, Brazil’s first national park, on the edge of which Uuskallio established his community on a farm. Farming proved difficult, since the land had previously been used to grow coffee beans and the soil was worn out. But with hard work, the Finnish settlers eventually got corn, yams, bananas, and various citrus fruits to grow. The Finns brought their culture to this little pocket of Brazil, including the sauna, which became popular. After 1942, when the colony’s agrarian way of life was finally deemed unsustainable, they turned to the draw of their culture to attract visitors, and tourism eventually became the primary driver of the settlement’s economy. Visitors were already coming to Penedo because of its proximity to Itatiaia, and staying in the houses of the residents. The Finnish settlers capitalized on this trend, building more inns and hotels, and crafting wares like rugs and clothes to sell to the tourists. They started using Finnish cuisine and folk dancing as added attractions, and a folk dancing group still puts on regular performances. The “Little Finland” attraction opened in 1998, complete with a Santa Claus House. Though the original homes and buildings of Penedo had not been built with the goal of recreating Finland, for the sake of authenticity amid the rise of tourism it was determined there should be a part of Penedo that resembled the home country of the settlement’s ancestors. The houses here look like they are built only of logs, and Santa Claus himself receives visitors all year long.",santa claus utopias christmas farms nature

Located within the Brazilian municipality of Teresópolis, this majestic granite wonder entices hikers, climbers, and thrill seekers from around the world to climb its rocky peak. Dedo de Deus, which translates to the “Finger of God,” is shaped like a giant hand with an extended index finger pointed towards the sky. At 5,417 feet it’s a tough climb for even the most experienced hikers, but those who dare the ascent can catch stunning views of the former capital of Brazil and surrounding Serra dos Orgãos National Park. It’s a favorite among both Brazilian and international climbers, and the best time to visit is from May to September during the winter season in South America. Less than one year ago, Roam Media interviewed extreme sportsman Ryan Robinson about his daring journey across a thousand-foot highline rigged to the famous rock. Suspended miles above the ground, he survived the journey and told the team that it “took four years of research, planning, setbacks, and one failed attempt” to cross it. “This location is unique because rock formations like this don’t exist in very many places in the world,” Robinson told Roam Media. “I’m not an expert on rocks, but I can tell you that there just aren’t very many places…where you have a finger shooting straight out of the ground, into the sky, that’s this tall and this sharp, and this drastic.” According to Mountain Project, the summit was originally claimed to be unreachable by elite European mountaineers.

161,Castelinho da Rua Apa,"São Paulo, Brazil",Striking ruins of a mansion that stood center stage in one of modern Brazil's most puzzling crimes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castelinho-da-rua-apa,"Known to generations of São Paulo residents as Castelinho da Rua Apa, or “the little castle of Apa Street,” what seems at first glance to be nothing more than the crumbling façade of an eccentric home is actually the site of a notorious murder mystery. Commissioned in 1912, the Castelinho da Rua Apa was built in the Santa Efigênia neighborhood — at the time one of the most noble areas of the city. Designed to resemble a medieval castle, patriarch Dr. Virgílio Cézar dos Reis had the family manor built as a gift to his wife, Maria Cândida Guimarães dos Reis. After moving into the castle, the couple would go on to have two sons, Alvaro and Armando. Like oil and water, the two brothers couldn’t be more different; the former was a lawyer and professional ice skater known for being an outgoing playboy, while Armando was more introspective, preferring to keep to himself. This difference would manifest after their father’s death in 1937, when the brothers hotly debated what to do with the family business. Just two months later, however, both Armando, Alvaro, and their mother would be found murdered on the floor of the Castelinho. What is known is that on the night of May 12, 1937, the family housekeeper overheard a loud noise echo from the main house, whereupon she found all three family members dead from gunshot wounds. Though the ensuing police investigation concluded that a squabble between brothers likely was to blame, the forensic evidence – several types of bullets implying multiple guns though only one was found, too many wounds for the brother “at fault” to have turned the gun on himself, etc. – didn’t line up with their portrait of the night’s events. With no surviving witnesses, the case continues to be one of the most mysterious in Brazilian history. After all owning parties were deceased, the Castelinho became property of local authorities. For the next 70-some years, the famous house moldered. The surrounding neighborhood fell into decline, and the Castelinho became a literal and figurative haunt for São Paulo’s darker forces. Such remained the case until the 1990s when a former homeless woman from the neighborhood, Maria Eulina, spent years petitioning the government for permission to restore the castle. In 1997, Eulina’s perseverance succeeded. In 2004,  Castelinho da Rua Apa was granted landmark status, and in 2007 approval for a restoration plan was granted. Though still in a considerable state of disrepair today, restorations are scheduled to begin any time now. In 2017,  the state government invested $2.8 million and helped convert it into the headquarters of the NGO Mothers Club of Brazil, a nonprofit that helps street dwellers.

162,The Nazi Graveyard of Brazil,"Laranjal do Jari, Brazil",This gravesite in the Amazon Rainforest was left behind by a failed Third Reich expedition.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nazi-cemetery-cachoeira-de-santo-ant-nio,"On a small island on a tributary of the River Jary in Brazil stands a nine-foot high wooden cross with a very odd decoration: a swastika. Even stranger is that on the cross it reads “Joseph Greiner died here on 2.1.1936,” which was three years before World War II officially started in 1939 (a year before the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, sometimes considered the start of the war) and over a decade before Nazis began making their way to Brazil in hopes of hiding out in the South American country. So, what was a Nazi doing in Brazil halfway around the world in 1936? According to the inscription on the cross, it was “a death from fever in the service of German Research Work.” Known as the “Guayana Project,” it was a mission of exploration and a testament to just how grand the Nazis imagined their empire would be. As the report brought back to the Third Reich explained, “the two largest scantly populated, but rich in resources, areas on earth are in Siberia and South America. They alone offer spacious immigration and settlement possibilities for the Nordic peoples… For the more advanced white race, it offers outstanding possibilities for exploitation.” In 1935, under the cover of collecting biological specimens, Schulz Kampfhenkel (the expedition leader), Joseph Greiner and another Nazi soldier, as well as many hired locals—described in a letter to the Third Reich as not being able to be “measured in civilized terms as we known them in Germany”—explored the region bordering French Guyana and sent back details about how the Nazi’s might infiltrate and begin colonizing the country for themselves. It was suggested that the country’s already existing Germans, roughly a million at the time, might become the start of what would be the great South American Third Reich Empire. Of course, this did not happen. Greiner died of malaria while on the expedition, and Kampfhenkel brought his report to the Reich. In the end, it wasn’t malaria, or the jungle, that put a stop to the plans to expand into Brazil but bureaucracy, and a lack of interest. ‘Given time, the plan may be submitted again” wrote Heinrich Himmler who was in charge of approving the plans. Today all that remains of this monomaniacal plan is the graves of the Nazis who perished in pursuit of it, known to locals as the “Nazi Graveyard.”  Latitude 0 deg 38' 56"" SLongitude 52 deg 30' 26"" W",lost tribes catacombs nazis catacombs and crypts sacred spaces

It’s the keystone celebration in Pomerode, which is considered to be “the most German town in Brazil.” The town preserves the cultural traits it inherited from the first settlers who founded the city in 1861. The majority of these German immigrants came from Pomerania, a northern region of Germany. Many of Pomerode’s 25,000 residents are trilingual in German, Portuguese, and the increasingly obsolete East Pomeranian German dialect. The town’s heritage is evident throughout its architecture. Many of its buildings look as though they’ve been plucked from a German village and whisked across the Atlantic Ocean before being plopped in southern Brazil. One of these buildings is the preserved and restored half-timbered home of the very first German immigrant to settle in Pomerode, a man named Carl Weege. The house museum one of multiple historic attractions that delve into Pomerode’s German heritage. The local people’s personalities, religious beliefs, and gastronomy also reflect their German roots. The town has its own folklore groups, bands, choirs, and hunting and shooting clubs. Most locals even supported Germany over Brazil in the 2014 World Cup. The town also has beautiful parks and an impressive zoo. While there, be sure to raise your mug of German beer with a hearty cheer of “prost!” If you want to learn more about the history about the town visit the Pomerano Museum at Rua Hermann Weege, 111.",immigration preservation culture cities houses homes architectural oddities museums history architecture

The etymology of these monkeys name has an interesting origin with roots in the early years of the Portuguese colonization of Brazil in the 15th century. When the first explorers encountered these monkeys in the Atlantic forests they caused some amusement as they were thought to resemble the friars of the Franciscan Capuchin order, a familiar sight in the men’s native Portugal. This was due to the bushy cap of hair of the monkeys that resembled the tonsure hairstyle of the monks and the brown coloration of their fur, which matched the color of the cowl garment worn by the order. Capuchin monkeys are believed by scientists to be the most intelligent species of New World monkeys and are considered by some primatologists to be the most intelligent non-ape primate. Studies have shown that not only do these monkeys use tools to get food, but they also have self-awareness. Capuchin monkeys have even been successfully trained to help disabled people. The brainy brilliance of these monkeys is evident at the Manduri reserve where large troops can be seen at close quarters interacting and feeding amongst the trees. Certain individual monkeys have even become talented thieves when it comes to stealing food from visitors to the park. Unfortunately, although these particular groups of black-horned capuchins are safe in the Manduri forest reserve, the conservation status of the species is classified as an endangered species due to massive rates of deforestation. By visiting the reserve you help contribute to the conservation of the species.  It's not a good idea to feed the monkeys (as the signs indicate) as a lot of human food can damage their health and make them obese or even diabetic. There are areas in the park with facilities for BBQ's but if you do decide to use them, please make sure that you put out the fire after use and dispose of any garbage in the bins that are provided.",brazil monkeys animals

This is because as soon as a car is stopped without the emergency brake it will slowly begin to roll uphill, gaining speed as it goes. There are lots of folk explanations, including that the hill is haunted or that a massive deposit of iron ore lies beneath the street, drawing vehicles up to its magnetic pull. In reality, the phenomenon is apparently an optical illusion. Though the street appears to be on a steep incline, there is actually a slight dip in the road. Though cars appear to be rolling uphill they’re actually rolling down.

Built in the town of Caxias do Sul, where the stray dog and cat population booms do to lack of spaying and neutering facilities, the miniature shantytown is an attempt by the animal rights organization So Ama (Just Love) to care for the beasts that would otherwise be the victims of starvation, disease, and casual cruelty. So Ama wanted to build a fully functioning shelter to look after all of the animals, but when they realized they did not have the funds to complete the project, they took inspiration from the surrounding city and began building simple doghouses out of cobbled together wood and sheet metal. Housing more than 1,600 dogs and 200 cats among the 1,000 unadorned units tightly packed onto the organization’s property, So Ama’s facility mirrors the conditions of millions of impoverished Brazilians in the surrounding area with eerie accuracy. Unfortunately the dogs and cats also face many of the same problems. While the furry hooverville is partially subsidized by government funds, most of So Ama’s money comes from donations. However it requires a purported 13 tons of food a month to feed the population of animals, not to mention any veterinary services manny of the formerly homeless animals need, and the charity the organization receives rarely covers the costs. Thus the dogs and cats in the Caxias do Sul favela live most of their lives just like the humans: simply trying to get by.",cats dogs animals

Such was the case in Ubatuba, Brazil in October of 2000, when the body of a dead humpback whale was deposited onto one of the city’s busiest beaches, like a sad gift no one wanted. Shortly after its arrival, the whale’s rotting body began contaminating the beach with its overpowering stench and the bi-products of its massive rotting body. Local officials started scrambling. Approximately 50 individuals from Brazil’s Civil Defense and Forestry Police departments attempted to remove the stranded whale’s remains, employing six tractors to no avail. A subsequent plan was attempted using a tugboat loaned by the Brazilian gas company Petrobras to tow the body by attaching a series of wires to the carcass. This failed when the wires connecting the body to the bow broke before the whale had budged. All the while, neighbors had begun complaining about the smell. Having learned from past debacles (like the infamous case in Oregon), officials in Ubatuba settled on digging a gigantic hole in the sand and simply burying the whale where it lay. Eight years later, a team from the Ubatuba Aquarium had an idea. Part of a joint project with schools in the area, experts from the aquarium decided to exhume the humpback whale’s skeleton, which had lain peacefully unmolested below the sands ever since the initial attempted disposal debacles. Together, the professionals and amateurs reconstructed the whale’s skeleton. Today visitors to São Paulo can visit the whale outside the Ubatuba Aquarium, where it has been installed in a spot of prominence, swimming through the skies for eternity.

170,Museu Afro Brasil,"São Paulo, Brazil",A labyrinthine museum chronicling the history of African culture in Brazil.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museu-afro-brasil,"In a shaded corner of Ibirapuera Park, you’ll find one of São Paulo’s cultural gems, the Museu Afro Brasil, which chronicles the ethnographic history of Africans in Brazil. The collection of more than 6,000 pieces of art and artifacts explores the many ways African culture has shaped Brazilian society, winding through the history of the transatlantic slave trade and the African diaspora in Brazil—the last country in the Western hemisphere to formally abolish slavery—to a gallery of paintings and sculptures by contemporary Afro-Brazilian artists. As to be expected, the exhibits on the history of slavery are of a solemn and deeply disturbing nature. Perhaps the most moving exhibit is the enormous archive of faded photographs taken in the era before slavery was abolished. They feature the haunting portraits of hundreds of enslaved people and their “owners,” and many illustrations, paintings, and 19th-century newspaper clippings relating to slavery and other aspects of the Afro-Brazilian experience. There is even an authentic manuscript of “The Golden law” treaty that finally brought about the abolition of slavery in 1888. The museum displays several horrifying and authentic instruments of torture used by slave owners; a partial restoration of the remains of a slave ship galley hold, which would have carried countless enslaved human “cargo” from Africa to the New World; and agricultural equipment that enslaved workers used in the backbreaking and often lethal labor that powered the Brazilian plantation economy. Also chronicled is the story of the Portuguese and Brazilian elites who profited from human misery. Their financial motives and cultural mindset are critically examined, and you can even read their letters and see their clothes and furniture. The museum also celebrates the formative role that the African diaspora played in Brazilian culture, and on a wider scale, Latin American culture, leaving a rich legacy of traditions, religion, folkloric beliefs, cuisine, art, music, and sport. The exhibits showcase vibrant Afro-Brazilian art contrasted with ethnographic artifacts such as masks and fetishes from many different parts of the African continent, which seem imbued with a secret inner life. Even the history of the cultural exchange between African escaped slaves and the indigenous peoples of Brazil has its own fascinating exhibit. A gallery at the entrance displays a vast collection of artifacts and contemporary religious and sacred art from the African diaspora in other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. Here you can find treasures such as sinister-looking Voodoo dolls from Haiti, erotic Santeria fetishes from Cuba, and the sublime carvings of Brazilian Candomblé orixás. A visit to this museum is essential both for travelers and locals seeking to decipher the rich and tangled roots of Brazilian culture. The museum layout is not straightforward, so if you think you missed something keep searching  The museum is located near the Gate 10 entrance to the Manoel da Nóbrega Pavilion in Ibirapuera Park. It's open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. There are multiple ways to get to Ibirapuera park.

The artwork allows visitors a glimpse into the inner world of inmates. There are also objects used by prisoners in daily life, that help visitors imagine what it is like to be incarcerated, such as tattoo tools, rudimentary weapons, and even a machine that produces alcohol from leftover food.

Visitors are even invited to experience what it is like to be locked up in a dark cell for a few minutes. The museum is housed in a former prison complex in Carandiru. In 1992, it was the largest complex in South America and became the site of the biggest prison massacre in the history of Brazil when 111 prisoners were murdered by the police.

The museum was created by sociologist and anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, and its collection reflects the peculiarities of life in the northern region of Brazil. Outdoor displays feature walk-in, hands-on representations of communal housing in forest villages as well as traditional methods for processing rubber and cassava. Indoor artifacts include ceramic and wooden archaeological sculptures, traditional paintings, and ritual clothing such as full-body, painted tunics made of tree bark that are worn by Amazonian boys to acknowledge the onset of menstruation for their female peers. Urban artifacts like Carnaval costumes, electric cable cars, and vintage automobiles are juxtaposed with dugout canoes and foods foraged from the forest such as Brazil nuts and guaraná, a wild berry that contains a caffeine-like substance used in the production of popular local beverages and energy drinks.

It chronicles every imaginable aspect of the immigrant experience, making it a perfect place to spend an hour or two exploring the history of the country with the largest Japanese community outside of Japan. Within its dark corridors, you’ll find a treasure trove of artifacts and stories collected from the Japanese diaspora all over Brazil. Much of the museum focuses on the contributions Japanese immigrants made to Brazil’s agricultural industrialization. You’ll learn about the experiences of ordinary workers who, through their toil and sweat, cleared jungle to make coffee and sugar plantations. Plants and foods the immigrants would have learned to subsist on and use to cure diseases are displayed next to taxidermied and embalmed specimens of animals they would have encountered and learned to fear, such as the jaguar, giant anteater, and jararaca pit viper. One of the most impressive exhibitions in the museum is an authentic and eerie recreation of typical hut an immigrant coffee plantation worker would have lived in in the 1930s. It’s complete with portraits of the Japanese imperial family and a Shinto shrine, as if stuck in a time warp. The museum contains much more than agricultural content, though. There’s a vintage photo archive featuring late-19th-century and early-20th-century photographs.

But if you’re planning to visit this coastal town and expect to find only picturesque landscapes, prepare yourself to be surprised by the mysticism and symbolism of Paraty’s 18th-century architecture, and what it unravels. Paraty was built by Freemasons when Brazil was under Portuguese rule, and the colonial Masonic architecture and colorful symbols can be found all over the historic center. There are iconic geometric ciphers, vertical bands of Freemasons’ geometric panels, and street corners with three pillars in stone and one in whitewash (symbolizing a triangle standing for liberty, equality, and fraternity). Many of the buildings are painted blue and white, the ancient Masonic colors. Freemasons established Paraty after fleeing persecution in Europe. While the group had to exist discreetly in the Old World, in Brazil they were free to paint the town with overt Masonic language and signs. The old city was designed with 33 blocks (the Freemasons’ sacred number); the houses were built in 1: 33.33 scale; and the town was once governed by 33 councilmen. A huge monument of the Masonic Square and Compasses symbol was even found, mysteriously, by a diver deep underwater off the Island of Meros. The Masons had a huge influence on the architecture of the Paraty, which has a unique feeling of being trapped in time. In this tranquil setting we can find, for example, the church of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios, dating from 1667, a time when the city was one of the main commercial sea ports in the world, or even centenary forts and warehouses, a reminiscence of Portuguese architecture in Brazil. Paraty’s mystic past, as well as the natural beauty of the Atlantic rain forest, make this UNESCO site a unique travel destination. The town’s cobbled streets, the little shops, the adorned windows and narrow doorways are a tempting invitation for a pleasant stroll or a quest to find the city’s surviving Masonic stores.

That almost happened, as the Dutch occupied Brazil from 1630 to 1654. Though the Dutch left Brazil centuries ago, their armory, weapons, and influences are still present, at least at the Ricardo Brennand Institute. The institute is housed within a contemporary building in the shape of a European castle. It’s the perfect aesthetic for a museum that takes visitors back to a time of knights and armor, weapons and chivalry. The Ricardo Brennand Institute holds South America’s largest collection of weapons and armory: daggers, swords, maces, flails, halberds, crossbows, knives, stilettos—some even decorated with semi precious stones. The armory come from mainly European countries, though India and Japan are represented as well. The collection includes 27 full-plate armors and even protections for dogs and horses. The castle-like building was modeled after a Tudor-style construction. It has its own coat of arms, drawbridges, and even original European altarpieces. In addition to holding its large collection of weaponry, it also houses a library full of over 60,000 items and the world’s largest collection of paintings by the renowned New World landscape artist Frans Post. Ricardo Brennand, a Brazilian art collector, inaugurated the institute in 2002. It has offered art and cultural education programs to the local community ever since.

181,Immigration Museum of São Paulo,"São Paulo, Brazil",This intriguing museum chronicles the history and impact of immigration in Brazil.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/immigration-museum-of-sao-paulo,"The Immigration Museum of São Paulo is housed in the 19th-century Hospedaria de Imigrantes (Immigrant Inn), where migrants arriving in Brazil once lived while awaiting legal residency in the country. Today the building is a brilliant museum in their memory, where visitors can learn about the crucial role that immigration played in the modern history of Brazil. The imposing grounds of the museum contain a large and beautiful garden with plants and trees from all over the world. A train station on the grounds maintains an authentic feel and even houses a steam train that once transported migrants from the ports to the immigration center. Over the decades, diverse groups of people disembarked from this train to live in the inn before they were given official permission to reside legally in Brazil. Many of the newcomers (although not all) arrived under very difficult circumstances. Italian, Romanian, Irish, Lebanese, and Japanese migrants left behind the rural poverty of their homelands. The Portuguese fled a country that had been reduced to economic ruin by the stock market crashes of the ’20s while Spaniards came escaping the carnage and chaos of the civil war.  Armenians escaped the Middle East due to the genocidal policies of the Ottoman empire, while Russian and German Jews came fleeing the Tsarist pogroms, Stalinist purges, and the Nazi concentration camps. Here in this atmospheric building, you can walk among the rows of beds where these people slept at night. You can glimpse the photo archive revealing the faces of the thousands of migrants who passed through the building for over half a century, and even read their letters. An exhibit on the quarantine hospital shows the vaccines, surgical instruments, operating tables, and medical supplies that the immigrants would have been treated with. Also displayed are the worldly possesions (donated by their families) that they brought from home, such as teddy bears, violins, gramophones, Japanese umbrellas, war medals, sewing machines, umbrellas, smoking pipes, and of course, portraits of loved ones. One particularly interesting interactive display exhibit showcases the contributions that each of the different cultures made to the agricultural, artistic, and industrial progress of one of the most cosmopolitan and diverse nations on Earth. The museum is also notable for revealing the individual human stories of the immigrant experience. An audio exhibit features recorded interviews with the men and women who immigrated to Brazil as children, who recount their memories of arriving at the center and the difficulties and joys of adapting to life in the new country.  Take the metro (Red line direction Vermelha) to Bresser Mooca station. From there you can reach the museum on foot via a 10-minute walk down the Rua Visc de Paranaiba road until you reach the end. You won't miss the building as it is very distinctive and is signposted.",immigration culture museums history

Formed by 6,000-plus years of waves washing up against calcium carbonate, the smooth, swirling blues of the cavern walls are a reflection of the lake’s azure waters, which change in intensity and hue, depending on water levels and time of year. Located far from any road, the caves are accessible only by boat. Thirty-minute tours are operated by a local company, weather and water conditions permitting. The best time of the year to visit the Marble Caves is roughly between September and February when the ice melts feeding the lake and the color of the water is particularly enchanting turquoise. In terms of hours, the best time to take a boat tour is early morning to catch the right lighting for great pictures. There are ferries from Chile Chico that will take you to and through the Marble cave and its tunnels.

The otherworldly hotel looks as though it was dug into a natural stone spire, but the Montaña Mágica Lodge was in fact man-made. Using locally sourced lumber and stone, the creators of the lodging built up a tall cone. Water pours from the top down the sides in-between the guest windows, running under rich layers of jungle foliage growing on the exterior. Inside, each of the cozy suites is named after a local species of bird, and all feature a selection of modern amenities that rival even fancier hotels in less remote parts of the country. And if the strangeness and beauty of the hotel itself fail to impress, it offers a number of other attractions. Among the offerings are hot tubs “made out of huge trunks of trees, dug out, and then filled with hot water perched on a deck overlooking the forest.” There is also a mini golf course built into the forest itself, using the natural world as the obstacles, and there are various outdoor activities such as horseback riding, rafting, and hiking. Of course, getting to such a magical place takes a bit of doing. The ride to Montaña Mágica Lodge is at least two hours from the nearest airfield.

184,"""El Gigante"" and the Stone Moai of Easter Island","Easter Island, Chile",The largest stone Moai on Easter Island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-gigante-and-the-stone-moai-of-easter-island,"One of the first realizations one has about Easter Island is, it’s not an archipelago. There are no other islands surrounding it. No, in all directions there is nothing but empty ocean for greater distances than from any other inhabited island on Earth. Easter Island is the ultimate island. Besides its remoteness, Easter Island is, of course, famous for its massive stone sculptures or “Moais.” The largest of these is “El Gigante,” located near the Rano Raraku Quarry, which stands some 72 feet tall (well, 71.93 to be exact). El Gigante weighs in at an astonishing 160-182 metric tons, more then the weight of two full 737 airplanes. However, El Gigante was ambitious even for the master movers of Easter Island. Experts believe that had they finished this Moai (there is some question as to whether they ever intended to), it is unlikely the islanders would have been able to move it. In comparison, Paro, the largest Moai ever erected, is 10 meters (33 ft) high, and weighs 75 metric tons. Though the giant statues have been the subject of many conspiracies and myths, one gradually realizes there are few major mysteries left about them. We know who built them (Polynesian colonizers of the island, the early Rapanui people), how they were built (carved mostly from tuff and polished smooth by rubbing with pumice), how they were likely transported (wooden sledges, log rollers, and ropes), when they were built (between 1250 and 1500 CE), and very probably why. These sculptures (often called heads, though they are in fact disproportionately sized full-body figures, often seen buried halfway in dirt) represent specific ancestors. These representations were erected between the village and chaos — the ocean — as a wall of protection. The two major tribes of Easter Island lived in a tropical rain-forest, a paradise of food and fishing, with plenty of time to put into the Great Work of the statues. According to resident archaeologist Edmundo Edwards, the Polynesians used to sail back and forth across the great distances among the Pacific islands, but at a certain point they used up all the large trees and thereby lost the ability to make large canoes. At this point they became trapped. The old middens (a dump for domestic waste) show that fish bones got progressively smaller as the Polynesians could no longer sail out to deep fisheries. The island is only 45 square miles total. In the 16th and 17th centuries, statue building accelerated, and the population grew, reaching around 40,000. Then, around the year 1160, the whole thing collapsed. Some 2,000 people live on the island now, and the landscape is barren. No trees grow here except for a few invasive and problematic eucalyptus groves. How could a people smart enough to navigate to tiny landfalls on thousands of miles of Pacific ocean and capable of vast engineering projects like the Moai statues be so unable to deal with the coming of a doom which must have been obvious on such a tiny island? It may have been easier then we imagine. A few years ago, locals on Easter Island discovered they could catch and sell lobsters from around the island. They then caught and sold those lobsters until there were no more. Though much is known about the Moais, there’s lots more archaeology to do on Easter Island than digging up stone sculptures. Researchers are just starting on the villages — and their story is one of the most compelling on Earth: Humans can make their own bad luck. In the case of Easter Island, ever larger and larger statues were not the right defense. In conjunction with the Long Now Foundation.

Suspended over a flowing stream, the crimson walkways leading to the various pools are made entirely of painted wood that stands out in stark contrast to the surrounding wilderness, while at the same time managing to seem right at home. There are 17 pools in total at the spa, each of them fed directly from a natural hot spring via wooden pipes that run beneath the walkways, making sure that they are largely warm and dry. Next to each pool is a small hut/changing room made of the same redwood as the paths. Each hut has grass planted on the roof, giving the whole facility a timeless feel, almost as if they are some extension of the natural backdrop. The whole thing rests at the bottom of a canyon, and mists rise from the warm waters in a nearly constant fog. Between the Japanese-styled architecture and the Chilean nature, few places in the world can claim quite such a perfect harmony of nature and design. This place is really hard to find.

About 75km south-east of the town of Antofagasta, its monotony is shattered by a sight even more alien then the desert itself, and yet undoubtedly human: an 11-meter-tall hand protruding out of the sand. Mano de Desierto is a work of the Chilean sculptor Mario Irarrázabal, built in the early 1980s. It was financed by a local booster organization called Corporación Pro Antofagasta. The motion of hands rising from the ground is an obsession of Irarrázabal’s. His other famous works include another over-sized sculpture exploring the same idea: “Monument to the Drowned” is located on Parada 4 at Brava Beach in Punta del Este, a popular resort town in Uruguay. Another large sculpture, “The Awakening,” by American artist John Seward Johnson II expresses a similar idea and is located at National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland.  From Antofagasta, Route 26 or Route 28, both connect to Route 5. The Mano can be found between mile markers 1309 and 1310. It is easy to reach from either direction and can be seen well in advance. If you're going to drive out for a visit, be sure you have sun-screen, plenty of water, and a full tank of gas.

The design was intended to surrender to the geography around it, and surrender it does. Pathways along the rocks twist, widen and narrow haphazardly, with no railings available to provide assurance. Staircases appear and disappear, carved into the stone cliffs, bridging formally unreachable vistas. Flagstone walks lead through narrow passageways that open up into restored and carefully developed open spaces. These features built by human hands seem to grow organically from the landscape around them. This elaborate passageway was built between 2004 and 2006, employing more than 40 stonemasons to cut, carve, and smooth the mountainside. The oceanside trail system was the invention of landscape architect Teresa Moller, who has described her inspiration as a channeling of the words of a famous Chilean poet, who described Chile as “pure geography.” A brilliantly planned out architectural masterpiece, the entire winding trail along the water and across a restored creek creates a single, mind-blowing spatial experience that is open to the public.",

As tribal rituals go, that of the Birdman on Easter Island is right up there with the stuff of Hollywood. Each year, contestants were selected as competitors for the title of Birdman. Each contestant would then sponsor a representative of their choosing who would be challenged to scale the dangerous face of the Rano Kau cliff, then swim shark-infested waters to the small island of Motu Nui. There, the task was simple: find eggs laid by the elusive Sooty Tern. The first to find an egg for their sponsor was declared the winner. In turn, the sponsor (but not the one who did all of the work) would be crowned as the Birdman, or Tangata-Manu. The title allegedly earned the victor and his clan all of the benefits of a god during the year that he held the lofty title. Leaving the main town, Hanga Roa, to the south, you will pass several restored moai before coming to the Ana Kai Tangata cave. Then begins the gradual climb to Rano Kau crater and on to Orongo on top of 1000-foot cliffs. It can take a bit of leg and lung power, but is well worth the opportunity to take in the magnificent viewpoints. From Rano Kau, it’s a 15-minute walk to Orongo, where historic stone dwellings cling to the side of the cliff overlooking the ocean and the site of the Birdman Competition.

Known as “funicular” elevators, the unusual public transit method consists of a cable car which is pulled up and lowered down a steep incline. Looking like small boxcars that are delicately balanced as the metal cable drags them up the hill, the elevators recall American railroad engineering put to some off-kilter purpose. With the first such elevator dating back to 1911, they continued to pop up around the densely populated hill, connecting formerly isolated neighborhoods, until there were 31 working elevator sites. Unfortunately with a downturn in the Valparaiso economy caused by the construction of the Panama Canal, a number of people moved from the city and many of the mechanical elevator stations fell into disrepair, or shut down completely, tragically cutting off people who had come to depend on the rails for transportation. After decades of neglect, the number of working elevators in the city has dwindled to just 14. However, efforts undertaken by the World Monuments Fund and others have begun making plans which could help preserve the unique pieces of civil ingenuity. Hopefully Valparaiso’s elevators can continue to ascend in importance so that they don’t go down forever. Not all the elevators built are working today, but there are 15 you can visit. Bring cash, even better if you bring coins. Elevators are the cheapest way to go up the hills and they usually cost less than 50 cents (100-200CHP).

Founded in 1905 and abandoned in the 1970s, the so-called City of Stairs is a fascinating example of the company towns that set up shop in some of the world’s most remote locations. Situated at more than 7,220 feet (2,200 meters) above sea level in the Andes, on an exposed slope too steep for wheeled vehicles, Sewell wasn’t exactly prime real estate. But when the Braden Copper Company found plentiful reserves in them thar hills, it set about building a town to house all its workers. These workers were needed to extract copper from El Teniente (“The Lieutenant”), an underground copper mine that would become the largest in the world. Due to the steepness of Sewell’s location, the town planners had to get creative. The entire urban design was based around a large central staircase, the Escalera Central, which climbed up the hillside from the railway station down below. From this radiated a series of other pedestrian-only stairways and paths, giving the town its nickname, the Ciudad de las Escaleras, “City of Stairs.” To keep things a little more cheery, the buildings were painted a variety of colorful shades. And to save the miners and their families from a chilly descent into the depths of boredom, the company built playgrounds and plazas, shops and a social club, and even a movie theater. Alcohol was banned throughout the town, but the miners normally found a way to bring in a donkey-load of liquor. For 60 years, Sewell thrived and expanded. At its height in 1968, it was home to more than 15,000 people. But its history wasn’t short of a few tragedies. Two of the most fateful incidents occurred in consecutive years. On the night of August 8, 1944, an avalanche tumbled down from the slopes above Sewell, killing 102 people. A year later, a fire broke out at the El Teniente mine, trapping the workers inside. The incident, known as El Humo (“The Smoke”), killed 355 men, many dying from carbon monoxide poisoning. It remains the worst metallic mining accident in Chile’s history. Neither accidents nor natural disasters were the ultimate cause of Sewell’s abandonment. Instead, it was nationalization by the Allende government that brought about the town’s demise. In 1977, after six years of state ownership, the National Copper Corporation of Chile began to move families out of Sewell. And then they began to destroy the town. Thankfully, the Chilean government realized that Sewell was worth saving for posterity’s sake. It halted the demolition in the 1980s and declared Sewell a National Monument in 1998. In 2006, UNESCO designated Sewell a World Heritage Site, further protecting what is now one of the best preserved examples of a company mining town. Fifty or so colorful buildings have been faithfully restored, and an on-site museum helps explain the history of the abandoned City of Stairs.  Visiting Sewell is by tour only. Tours can be arranged in Santiago, 45 miles to the north of Sewell, or in Rancagua, 20 miles to the west.",copper color unesco mining ghost towns abandoned history

Likely created sometime between 1000 and 1400 CE by a successive series of indigenous cultures including the Inca, the massive figure rests among about 5,000 smaller images of birds, mystical designs, and other images that have been etched on the ground. The images were created by either digging out the lines of the design from the soil, or by placing patterns of stones and sand on top of it, and sometimes a mixture of the two methods. (Successive cultures worked to create the images, which accounts for the variation.) The giant itself is 390 feet tall and built in a direct and unpretentious design with no flourishes, save for the straight lines emanating from its head and torso to imitate either some sort of ceremonial garb or the unearthly features of a god. Whichever the lines symbolize, researchers have determined that they very likely served a practical purpose as well. When they aligned with the moon, the lines in the giant’s headdress, in conjunction with the other points on its body, the image would have been used to track the time of year, so that the ancient builders could predict the coming of the crucial rainy season. While the Atacama Giant may not be the most famous geoglyph in the game (that distinction goes to the Nazca Lines), the size, clarity, and former importance of the rain god to the people who made the design, allow it to stand tall regardless.",seen from space geoglyphs archaeology art

The El Tatio geyser field, located just a few miles from the Bolivian border, is a spectacular sight for those who make the trek. At 14,173 feet (4,320 meters) above sea level, it’s a dreamlike high-altitude location surrounded by stratovolcanoes that form part of the local geothermal system. El Tatio covers an area of 12 square miles, with geysers, boiling water fountains, fumaroles, hot springs, mud pools, and mud volcanoes seeping steam across its surreal expanse. It’s the highest geyser field in the world, the largest in the southern hemisphere, and the third largest in the world after Yellowstone in the U.S. and the Valley of Geysers on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. Both the Chilean government and private companies have had a close look at El Tatio over the last 50 or so years, with the idea of harnessing the geothermal energy. So far, however, El Tatio’s relative remoteness and environmental concerns have stalled any geothermal power projects. Due to the presence of extremophile microorganisms on the vents at El Tatio, the site has also been studied as a possible analogous example of life on early Earth and potential past life on Mars. According to a study by Ruff and Framer, the unique environment and conditions of El Tatio “provide a better environmental analog for Mars than those of Yellowstone National Park (USA) and other well-known geothermal sites on Earth.” Despite the best efforts of energy companies and wannabe Martians, tourism remains the main business at El Tatio, which was declared a protected area in 2010. Visitors arrive in the early morning to see the geysers shoot steam into the air, a sight most clearly visible between 6 and 7 a.m. A certain amount of caution is advised, as bleary eyed tourists and boiling pools of water don’t tend to mix too well.

Located next door to the Montana Magica Lodge, the Hotel Nothofagus is just as special. The Nothofagus is at least seven stories tall and is made almost entirely of wood. Situated in the middle of the forest, this hotel has a central atrium that reaches from the bottom of the lowest floor to a skylight on the roof. The hotel rooms are all positioned around this and have views overlooking the forest, a single ramp leading up past all the rooms. In all, there are 55 suites and multiple common dining areas. Visitors can even climb to the roof (there’s also an elevator) and get a view of the nearby Choshuenco Volcano. The building itself looks like something from the forest moon of Endor, home of the Ewoks in Star Wars. Beyond even the magic of the hotel itself, rope bridges connect it to the equally fantastical Montana Magica Lodge next door. The rainforest might be one of the most mysterious and magical environments on the planet, so it’s somewhat surprising that a hotel could make it even more so.  Location on the map is off by about 140 miles. Actual location is 39-52-09S 071-54-51W. It is right off Rt 203. You may want to use the Montana Magica Lodge next door as a reference, as it is also in Atlas Obscura (though the location of the Lodge as mapped is a little bit off, it will get you close). It is 1.7 miles west/northwest of Puerto Fuy by car.",fantasy forests places to stay hotels ecosystems
198,Ana Kai Tangata (Cannibal Cave),"Easter Island, Chile",The ominously named cave is home to some remarkable ancient art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ana-kai-tangata-cannibal-cave,"On the remote island of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), the shark oil-based paintings of Cannibal Cave are often overlooked. But the mysterious site is worth the short, though treacherous, trek. The native name for this site is Ana Kai Tangata, which loosely translates into “Cave Eat Man” and can be interpreted in a number of ways. It has been proposed that the cave’s name could mean “cave where men eat,” “cave that eats men,” or “cave where men are eaten.” Rapa Nui has a rich history of tribal warfare, resource depletion, spiritualism, and famine, so stories of cannibalism are common. Visiting Cannibal Cave doesn’t have to be a time consuming stop, but it is an amazing area to spend some time watching the waves roll in and break along the cliffs. As you descend the roughly carved steps down the steps, you’ll start to see ancient painted images of ships and sacred birds. A visit to the cave is made more poignant by the fact that the paintings are fading. There is also an “evil twin” of Cannibal Cave a few steps to the south that is inaccessible. The outcropping of volcanic rock that separates the two caves is an excellent vantage point for some breathtaking wave watching. The ocean swells roll in and crash into the massive alcoves with impressive force and send cascades of frothy water along the walls and back into the crystal blue basin. Seeing the power of the Pacific against the jagged coastline of this isolated and remote island gives a great perspective on the resilience of the Tangata Manu who swam the waters in their ritualistic competitions.  There is a small parking lot along Policarpo Toro, which is the road leading up to the Orongo Volcano and some wooden signs guiding the way to the cave.",cannibals cave paintings paintings intriguing environs caves natural wonders ecosystems nature
199,The Navel of the World,"Easter Island, Chile","This large round boulder is said to emit spiritual power, but it may just be magnets.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-navel-of-the-world-easter-island-chile,"Easter Island is not short on marvelously mysterious stone structures what with the famous stone heads littering the island, yet there is another baffling landmark called the Navel of the World which may be a font of spiritual influence. On first sight, the so-called Navel of the World appears to be nothing more than a large, rounded boulder placed among a crude rock perimeter. However, the mysterious stone was believed to have been brought to the island specifically by the first king, Hotu Matua. The name of the stone comes from the legend that it is the navel of the world, from which all life sprang, although this is more likely due to its perfectly round shape. No matter the origin, the rock does display a few abnormal traits. For instance, when a compass is placed on the rock it loses its direction, likely due to magnetic elements in the rock itself rather than a more ephemeral cause. There are now four stones around the rock which were placed more recently and which represent the four sides of the compass. 9km north of Ahu Tongariki following the dirt road.

200,Bahá’í Temple of South America,"Santiago, Chile",A fantastical and futuristic temple of light built from nine monumental glass veils.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bahai-temple-of-south-america,"The mother temple for the Bahá’í faith in South America was opened in Santiago, Chile, in 2016. A temple of light open to all religions, it’s a stunningly beautiful combination of organic and futuristic design. The Bahá’í faith was founded in Iran in 1863, making it one of the world’s youngest religions. It currently has around 6 million followers. In a refreshing break from squabbling religious norms, the Bahá’í faith accepts all religions as having true and valid origins. Unity is a central tenet of the faith: unity of all religions and of all humankind. Bahá’í arrived in South America in 1919, introduced by Martha Root, a woman from Ohio who became one of the most prominent traveling teachers of the faith. Despite speaking no Spanish or Portuguese, Root spread the word as best she could in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Cuba. Almost a century later, Santiago was chosen as the location for the new Bahá’í Temple of South America. The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Chile announced a competition to select the final design. The winner was Siamak Hariri of Hariri Pontarini Architects in Toronto, Canada—and it’s easy to see why. The temple looks as if an organic, bud-like alien spaceship landed on the hills above Santiago. Nine monumental glass veils form its exterior, each built to different specifications but forming a beautifully cohesive domed whole. Reflecting the faith’s principles of openness and unity, the veils come together while allowing light and air to flow freely into the interior, which can hold 600 visitors. At sunset, the light inside the dome begins to shift from white to silver to ochre and then to purple, giving the exterior the appearance of a glowing flower bud slowly changing colors. And once night has fallen, you could easily be looking at something straight out of a sci-fi movie. The Bahá’í Temple of South America took 14 years to build and required plenty of innovation. In order to capture the required kind of light, two new cladding materials were developed: translucent marble from Portugal for the interior, and cast-glass panels for the exterior. The building was also designed to withstand extreme earthquakes and wind, with the veils supported by concrete columns on seismic bearings. Siamak Hariri won the 2017 Innovation in Architecture Award for his Bahá’í Temple design.  The temple is located on a hill on the eastern outskirts of Santiago. It’s free to enter. Services take place daily, with readings from the scriptures of all the world’s major religions.",temples religion sacred spaces architecture
201,Robinson Crusoe Island,"Juan Fernández, Chile","Named for the DeFoe novel inspired by a stranded sailor, this island is known for its rare plants and extreme beauty.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/robinson-crusoe-island,"Formerly known as Juan Fernandez after the Spanish captain who first landed there in the 16th century, Robinson Crusoe Island is the largest island in the Chilean Juan Fernandez archipelago, sitting about 400 miles west of South America in the South Pacific Ocean. It was on this island that the sailor Alexander Selkirk was marooned in 1704 and lived for four years and four months with only a musket, gunpowder, a knife, a Bible, and some carpenter’s tools before being rescued. Selkirk inspired Daniel Dafoe to write the classic novel Robinson Crusoe, for which the island was renamed by the Chilean government in 1966. While tourists number in the hundreds every year, there is a small group - 500 or 600, it is estimated - that live year-round in the village of San Juan Bautista. With an airstrip on the island, the residents have been able to bring in numerous television sets and several vehicles, though they maintain, for the most part, a spare lifestyle that depends on the spiny lobster trade. Tourists visit the island for its extreme beauty - coral reefs, white sand beaches, blue lagoon, palm trees, traditional thatched huts, tropical fruits, abundant seafood - and also to partake in a number of recreational activities that include hiking, horseback riding, birdwatching, snorkeling, sport fishing, and scuba diving. Scuba diving has been gaining popularity on the island as tourists are allowed to explore the wreck of the German light cruiser SMS Dresden, left in the area after a battle during World War I. Home to one of the most highly endemic ecosystems in the world, Robinson Crusoe Island and the two other islands nearby have been considered of maximum scientific importance for more than three decades. Names a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1977, the island is home to the Magellanic Penguin, a unique fur seal, and a critically endangered red hummingbird famous for its needle-fine black beak. Hit by a tsunami in February 2010 after a major earthquake hit Chile, much of the village on Robinson Crusoe Island was destroyed and five people killed. During prime vacation season, small planes of up to ten passengers leave Los Cerrillos and Tobalaba airports in Santiago daily. Arriving in La Punta after two and a half hours, visitors will then need to take a boat ride to the island. Carry cash as there are no ATMs on the island.",islands natural wonders nature
202,Museum of Memory and Human Rights,"Santiago, Chile",A museum founded to reflect on and remember the human rights abuses under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-memory-and-human-rights,"For a country with the longest history of political stability in Latin America, Chile suffered immensely during the years of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. In an effort to reflect on the horrors of those years, the Chilean government founded El Museo de la Memoria y Los Derechos Humanos, or the Museum of Memory and Human Rights. Located across the street from the beautiful Quinta Normal Park, the museum traces the history of the Pinochet dictatorship from its origins through to its modern implications, commemorating the victim’s abuses during the regime. The exhibits begin with the military coup of September 11, 1973, when former president Salvador Allende was killed and Agosto Pinochet rose to power and they end with contemporary visiting exhibits and archival access. It includes The three floors of the museum include video footage of detention centers, newspaper excerpts from the 1970s and 80s, and interactive photography and audio exhibits. Aside from educating the public through its exhibits, the museum also includes a comprehensive archive and documentation center which is open to the public. Like a mini-library, the Center of Documentation is located on the lowest level of the museum and includes both a physical collection of books as well as a digital collection of photography and videos related to this dark period of Chilean history. Easiest access provided by the Quinta Normal metro station.Access to the Museum of Memory and Human Rights, like many museums in Santiago, is free. Since the Museum deals with difficult themes, such as human rights abuses, not all content may be suitable for all audiences. There is a gift shop with souvenirs and books related to the Museum's subject. You should also think about an accompanying visit to Parque La Paz Villa Grimaldi, one of the sites used by the Pinochet regime as a camp and effectively fly off point to disappear bodies.

But these mesmerizingly colorful pools aren’t places a desert traveler would want to quench their thirst. The Atacama Desert is an arid landscape created by tectonic shift. Over time, the geological activity caused an ocean to form in the mountains, where the salty water remained trapped for millions of years. Much of this water has since evaporated. The remaining water is incredibly salty—its salinity is so high, it’s sometimes even saltier than the Dead Sea. The Lagunas Escondidas de Baltinache (Hidden Lagoons of Baltinache) are a relatively unknown spot near San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. Reaching them requires driving nearly 25 miles (40 kilometers) on curvy, unpaved roads through an area dubbed the “valley of patience.” You’ll soon see why it has this name—you have to watch your speed or risk losing a tire, or worse. Punctured tires litter the side of the roads, and shrines to those who died dot its edge. Once safely at the lagoons, you’ll find a series of dazzling blue lakes surrounded by shimmering crystals of salt. You can swim in a couple of the lakes, though the rest are off-limits for research and conservation purposes. The water is relatively cold, at about 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), but in the burning desert Sun, it feels refreshing.  Don't go here by yourself unless you have a 4x4 and know what you are doing. People have gotten fatally stranded on this road after a punctured tire. It's best to go with a tour guide who knows the area and has a proper car. These guides can be found in San Pedro.",salt deserts lakes water
204,The Nitrate Towns of Chile,"Tamarugal, Chile","Towns with a resource known as ""white gold,"" valuable enough to fight a war over, now stand ghostly and empty.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nitrate-towns-chile,"Until 1909, Chile had something very special. Known as white gold, Chile saltpeter, or more technically as Sodium nitrate, it was an extremely valuable commodity for two main reasons: it could kill, and it could also give life. Like its cousin, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate could be used as a fertilizer, an explosive, or rocket fuel. When someone talks about a fertilizer bomb this is the stuff they are talking about. The reason it was so valuable was that you couldn’t really make the stuff, you had to find it and Chile had tons of it. So valuable was this “white gold” that Chile went to war with its neighbors over areas containing the valuable saltpeter. In the oft-forgotten War of the Pacific or “Saltpeter war,” Chile, Peru, and Bolivia all fought over territory containing the minerals with Chile gaining much of the disputed territory. At the turn of the century, the Saltpeter Works of Humberstone and Santa Laura were both busy trying to extract as much of this Saltpeter as possible. Hundreds of buildings were built and whole communities of workers from South America, Europe, and Asia formed around these towns. In the words of UNESCO, they became a “distinct urban community with its own language, organization, customs, and creative expressions, as well as displaying technical entrepreneurship.” But something was coming that would change this all. In 1909 two German scientists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch figured out how to chemically fix nitrogen, that is, how to make this white gold on an industrial level. It was disastrous for the Saltpeter towns, and despite efforts to compete, by 1960 they were completely and totally abandoned. Today the town’s ghostly remains stand as rusting ruins in the inhospitable Atacama desert. In 2005 UNESCO declared them a World Heritage Site. Other “nitrate towns” nearby in a similar condition include Chacabuco, Maria Elena, Pedro de Valdivia, Puelma and Aguas Santas. It is ill-advised to visit Chacabuco, which was used as a concentration camp by Pinochet and is still surrounded by unmarked landmines.",explosions ghost towns ruins
205,The Devil's Blast,"Lota, Chile",The hellish conditions of this abandoned mine that snakes beneath the Pacific Ocean gave it its diabolic name.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-devils-blast-lota-chile,"A labyrinthine underground passageway snakes for roughly half a mile beneath the Pacific Ocean. With its lack of artificial ventilation and tremor-prone nature, this former mine is no place for the faint-hearted. Accessed merely yards from the pounding Pacific surf, a chilly wind accompanies the daring descent into the Devil’s Blast (El Chiflón del Diablo), an abandoned coal mine near Concepción. After it opened in 1857, the mine was soon given its diabolic forename by the intrepid miners who worked this underworld in truly hellish conditions, braving toxic gases, low oxygen levels, and frequent earth tremors. The second part of the Devil’s Blast’s name recalls the unique way it was naturally ventilated via the action of strong coastal breezes. These fierce gusts still whistle and howl through the pit’s narrow, forbidding entrances and tunnels. It was one of the only operational mines in the world that didn’t rely on some form of an artificial ventilation system to protect the miners from suffocating. The Devil’s Blast employed 3,000 people by the time it was closed in 1997. The site was re-opened as a visitor attraction in an attempt to entice tourists to Lota, which, with the demise of the Chilean coal-mining industry, had lost its main employer. Today, tours of this labyrinthine netherworld are conducted by former miners and last between 30 minutes and two hours. In 2009, the Devil’s Blast was designated a “National Monument” by the Chilean government. In February 2010, a massive earthquake measuring 8.8 on the richter scale caused damage to some above-ground parts of the attraction, but the mine tours recommenced the following year. The mine is open in summer from 10:00 to 6:00. Visitors to the mine can also buy a joint ticket including entry to the nearby formal gardens of Parque Isidora Cousiño, which were planted by the mine owners overlooking the mine and ocean.",abandoned mines coal subterranean underground mines tunnels subterranean sites
206,Shipwreck of the Lord Lonsdale,"Punta Arenas, Chile",The rusty hull of this 1899 ship serves as a tribute to explorers of the bottom of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lord-lonsdale-shipwreck,"Near the tip of Chile, in the town of Punta Arenas, rest the remains of a frigate: an old workhorse of a ship called the “Lord Lonsdale.” Exactly how and why she ended up here is a bit of a mystery. The Lord Lonsdale started its final journey a world away in Hamburg, Germany, in 1909. The 10-year old ship was set to sail all the way to Mazatlán on the western coast of Mexico. With the Panama Canal still under construction, that meant a trip through the Strait of Magellan, which separates mainland Chile from Tierra del Fuego. While stopped over in Stanley Harbour in the Falkland Islands, the ship caught fire. With the blaze out of control they did the only thing they could – they sank the ship. Stanley Harbour is 560 miles away from Punta Arenas, so how and why she ended up here is where the trail runs a little cold. After the fire, the steel hulk (the body of a ship that floats but isn’t seaworthy), was sold to a company of traders called Braun & Blanchard. They may have had plans to move it to their warehouses in Puerto Natales to use it for storage – a feat requiring hundreds of miles of towing through the straits – but it only got moved to Punta Arenas before they literally abandoned ship. Punta Arenas is a small city along the Strait of Magellan, often used as a jumping-off point for excursions to Antarctica. With the Lord Lonsdale left stranded at their beach, they were stuck with it. In what may be a case of looking for a little silver lining, there is now a sign at the site which reads (translated from Spanish): “The English Frigate Lord Lonsdale - A tribute to seafarers of all nationalities who crossed the Magellanic sea and made possible the best knowledge and settlement of this region.” Follow Ruta (Route) 9 south from Punta Arenas, and the Lord Lonsdale will be on your left, along the beach at Maria Behety Park.",exploration fires shipwrecks memorials
207,Iglesia de San Francisco,"Valparaiso, Chile","This iconic hilltop church doubled as a lighthouse in the 19th century, guiding ships into the port of Valparaíso.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iglesia-de-san-francisco,"The Iglesia de San Francisco (San Francisco Church) sits atop Cerro Barón, making it one of the most visible landmarks in Valparaíso. Completed in 1846, the Catholic church served a secondary function as a lighthouse, guiding ships towards the port. In more recent years it has suffered a series of devastating fires, but stubbornly refuses to be burned entirely to the ground. Built by the local Franciscan community, the church and its prominent steeple made an immediate impact on the skyline of the city, which at the time was developing into a major seaport. Ships rounding South America via the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn often docked at Valparaíso, which received a steady influx of European immigrants, mainly from Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Italy. The church, therefore, became an important point of reference for those at sea, the light in its tower helping ships navigate to the port. It was typically the first thing these ships would see, and sailors lovingly referred to the church as “Pancho,” the diminutive for “Francisco.” Pancho, in turn, became one of the nicknames for the city, and remains in use today. Apart from some remodeling in 1890, the church sat in relative tranquility for almost a century. Then, in 1983 (the same year it was declared a National Monument of Chile), the church began to attract a most unwelcome visitor: fire. The first fire struck in February 1983, and it took a few years to complete the reconstruction. Then, in September 2010, and while the church was still being repaired following an earthquake earlier that year, another fire threatened to reduce the Iglesia de San Francisco to ashes. The fire started in the church’s attic, possibly from some welding sparks, and damaged most of the roof. The reconstruction effort cost about $4 million. Just three years later, a third fire set the church ablaze. It began next door at the Institute of Mathematics of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, and leapt its way to the church. The damage was extensive, almost to the point of a possible complete collapse of the structure, and reconstruction efforts are still underway. But despite all this, the admirably resilient Iglesia de San Francisco still stands, its tower a historic marker in the old port city.",lighthouses fires churches sacred spaces history
208,Foucault Pendulum of Valdivia,"Valdivia, Chile","A 63-foot-tall swinging ball hypnotizes passersby, and proves to any remaining doubters that the Earth is spinning.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/foucault-pendulum-of-valdivia,"A hypnotic 220-pound chrome-plated lead ball has been swinging every 7 seconds on a 42-foot-long steel wire in this monumental glass and steel structure. Topped by an antique 19th-century lighthouse lamp and towering over Valdivia’s riverside, the tower houses the world’s most southerly example of a Foucault Pendulum. The Valdivia pendulum was created by Spanish physicist Miguel Cabrerizo in 2007, based on the works of French scientist Léon Foucault, who in 1851 set out to visually demonstrate that the Earth spins about its axis. A replica of the 1851 original Foucault Pendulum now hangs in the Paris Pantheon. To the earthbound observer, the plane of a Foucault pendulum’s swing appears to rotate, but this is an illusion. In reality, the swing of the pendulum stays on a steady plane relative to space and the Earth is the one that’s doing the spinning. Unlike the Parisian original, which seems to rotate clockwise, the sweeping swing of this Southern Hemisphere example appears to advance a fraction counter-clockwise with each pass. If, hypothetically, there were a Foucault Pendulum positioned right on the equator, it would appear to swing back and forth in just one plane with no observed rotation. Although a temporary Foucault Pendulum was erected at the South Pole in 2001, at almost 40° South, Valdivia’s is currently the world’s most southerly. This Chilean example appears to the dedicated observer to complete a 360° counter-clockwise rotation every 36 hours. A less patient observer could verify this fact in around the time it takes to walk round the nearby craft market, as a 10° shift in the plane of swing relative to Earth appears to occur every hour. If the physics of the mesmerizing ball is a bit baffling, passersby can admire the impressively towering glass-lighthouse-like structure it is housed in instead. The antique lamp which tops the pendulum’s glazed home is today of little use to passing pleasure boats in the Calle Calle river, but it once guided ships in the nearby bay of Corral. The Pendulum is located on the Avenida Arturo Prat, also known as the 'Costanera de la Ciencia' or 'Coast Road of Science', and is found opposite the Center for Scientific Studies.",earth physics instruments of science towers science
209,Pukará de Quitor,"San Pedro de Atacama, Chile",The ruins of a pre-Columbian fortress city so secure it held off the Spanish conquistadors for over 20 years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pukara-de-quitor,"San Pedro de Atacama is a beautiful little oasis town in the middle of the Atacama Desert in Chile. As it’s close to many natural sights, it’s often used as a hub town for tourists and travelers who want to see the country’s many wonders. But it is not the first town to be located here. Centuries before San Pedro was founded, there was Pukará de Quitor. Dating back to the 12th century, Pukará de Quitor was a walled city whose fortress housed and protected the local indigenous people from harm. This was necessary because their technological advancements allowed them to make pottery, masonry, basic metalworks, and other products that made them a potential target for rival tribes. The city was under Incan rule until roughly 1536, when news spread of the clash between the Incan Empire and the Spanish invaders. It took several more years before the Spanish came this far south and attempted to conquer Pukará de Quitor. When they did, the local forces were prepared, and the fortress city was very well protected thanks to its geographical location. It took the Spanish a staggering 20 years to take the city, kill its defenders, and assimilate the rest of the population. Unfortunately, this worked all too well, and little evidence remains of this indigenous civilization. Most of the information we have today is written from the Spanish perspective and its accuracy is dubious at best. The Pukará de Quitor archaeological site now preserves the ruins of the formidable fortress, which rises over 260 feet high, and archeologists are working hard to uncover more of the city’s secrets.  The town is just under two miles (3 km) north of San Pedro de Atacama. It can be accessed on foot, by bicycle, or by car. The entrance to the site is c$4000 for adults and c$2000 for students. Once inside, you can walk up a neighboring hill and look at the city from a distance. It is not permitted to enter the city itself.",incas fortresses colonialism archaeology ruins history
210,National Astronomical Observatory of Chile,"Santiago, Chile",This observatory high on a hilltop in the center of Santiago got its start in 1852.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-astronomical-observatory-of-chile,"An old story claims that Bernardo O’Higgins, a leader who freed Chile from Spanish rule in the Chilean War of Independence, wrote on his deathbed a letter to Chilean president Manuel Bulnes requesting that his estate be sold to fund an astronomical observatory on Santa Lucía Hill in the center of Santiago. There’s no real evidence to support the story, but not long after O’Higgins died, Lieutenant James Melville Gilliss selected the hilltop site for an observatory during an expedition in 1849. Gilliss went to Chile after establishing the U.S. Naval Observatory, the first in the States. After finishing the Santa Lucia Hill Observatory in 1852 Gilliss went back to the U.S., but left a staff behind to manage it. He later sold the site to the Chilean government, and it was renamed the National Astronomical Observatory of Chile. Thanks to many large areas with little or no light pollution, low precipitation, and somewhere around 200 cloudless nights every year, Chile is Earth’s unofficial astronomy capital. By 2020 it’s set to have 70 percent of the world’s astronomical infrastructure. It’s home to many professional, amateur, and international astronomical institutions, and more than 10 observatories, including Las Campanas Observatory which houses one of the world’s most powerful telescopes, the Giant Magellan. In 1929 the University of Chile took over management of the National Astronomical Observatory. A few decades later, in the 1960s, when the observatory was moved about 10 miles east to Cerro Calán, the Soviet Union sent astronomers and telescopes to help establish the new location. They withdrew after the 1973 coup, when the Soviets severed all diplomatic relations with Chile. The National Astronomical Observatory contains a number of exceptional telescopes including a 47-inch Millimeter-wave Telescope (identical to one located at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) and an 18-inch Cassegrain reflector from the Japanese government. Though it’s generally thought to have been completed in 1962 when the observatory moved to Cerro Calán, it’s been in operation for over 160 years.",telescopes observatories astronomy space exploration science
211,Dock of Souls (Muelle de las Almas),"Chonchi, Chile",A wooden dock art installation on Chiloé Island taps into the island's indigenous mythology.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dock-of-souls-muelle-de-las-almas,"Chiloé Island, in the far northern reaches of Patagonia, has long been an off-the-beaten-path tourist destination. Long popular with Chileans for its rich folklore and authentic rural feel (it’s a favorite escape for city-dwellers in Santiago), international tourists are now also discovering its magic. Much of Chiloé’s growing fame is due to the island’s incredible wooden churches, which are designated World Heritage sites.  But there’s another, much newer, wooden structure here that’s worth a visit. One of the biggest — if hard to get to — attractions on Chiloé is a new art installation tapping into the island’s indigenous mythology. Crafted by Marcelo Orellana Rivera, a Chilean wood sculptor and art professor from Santiago, this fascinating sculpture pays homage to the island’s native culture as well as its abundant natural forests, the source of the wood that made Chiloé’s boats and churches famous. The art piece is called Muelle de las Almas, the “Pier” or “Dock of Souls.” The wooden sculpture refers to the beliefs of the Mapuche, who once occupied all of south-central Chile and parts of neighboring Argentina. Before decades of frontier warfare in the 1800s reduced their territory, the Mapuche’s sway extended as far south as the northern Patagonian coastline. Today, their influence here is mostly felt in island folklore and place names. The legend animating the “Dock of Souls” is a spin-off of a more widespread Mapuche story, which tells of four whales (the trempulcahue), who were actually four old women turned into fantastic sea creatures. Their job was to carry the souls of the dead over the sea into the afterlife.  In the pre-Christian mythology of the Mapuche, the soul was believed to be a sort of “spark” from the universal soul (Pu-Am).  At birth, the individual soul (Am) became attached to the physical world, but after death, it soon dissolves in the Pu-Am again. Chiloé’s variant of this tale is slightly different. The local tale, centered around the fishing village of Cucao, says that the Tempilcahue was a cantankerous ferryman.  Like his Greek counterpart, this mysterious guide carried the souls of the dead over the water. And like Charon, the South American “psychopomp” required a fee — especially if the dead wanted to bring their dogs and horses along to keep them company in the next life.  (For this reason, the Mapuche placed small turquoise stones called “llancas” next to their dead to pay the ferryman’s price.) Punta Pirulil is a spectacular setting for the myth.  Here, the itinerant dead arrived from places inland, had to call out for the boatman, shouting “Balsero!”  At least that’s if you died on land.  If you died at sea, another supernatural sea creature, the Pincoya, a kind of siren, came to carry you away aboard a boat called the Caleuche. Not everyone got to take this fabulous trip, though.  Like a scene out of Dante, the Tempilcahue refused to take some souls back to the Pu-Am. Known in folklore as the “Animas de Cucao,” the dead who got left behind had to linger on here in torment among the enormous cliffs, unable to find rest.  The legend has it that their mournful voices sometimes swirled up from the waves along the rock faces, weeping in sorrow.  (Mysterious sounds can, in fact, be heard here.  But they’re likely to be the voices of sea lions on the rocks just offshore.) The legend of the “Animas de Cucao” comes with a warning:  If you hear these voices, never talk to one.  Do that, and within a year you’ll come back to this spot as a lost soul and never leave. Ironically, Punta Pirulil is a beautiful place to stay forever, if such is your fate.  If you don’t believe the old story, the spot is well worth a visit, anyway.  The remote coastline here is unimaginably breathtaking and there’s never a crowd in sight. The park is also a phenomenal destination for geology buffs.  The high cliffs here were dramatically sheared off in the 1960 Valdivia Earthquake — at 9.5 on the Richter Scale, the most powerful tremor ever recorded. Depending on the weather, Muelle de las Almas can be a challenge to get to, but worth the effort. Getting a rental car in Castro -- about a 45-minute drive away -- is probably your best bet, but a local bus line can take you as far as the small village of Cucao, where there's often horses to see along the beach. From Cucao, it's about a two- or three-hour walk back into the Parque Nacional Chiloé. It's possible to drive closer to Punta Pirulil, but beware of the back roads in wet weather. They're not paved and are very bumpy.A local couple runs a small natural history museum along the main road, where you have to pay a tiny fee to see the sculpture. If you drive further than this, you'll eventually come to a small parking lot in the forest. From the lot, it's about a 45-minute hike through idyllic hills, woods, and pastures to the cliffs and sculpture. Punta Pirulil is a small paradise and a prime spot for catching the sunset. Best time to visit: early December through February, which is summertime in the Southern Hemisphere.",mythology islands art
212,Museo a Cielo Abierto,"Santiago, Chile",The gorgeous murals at this open-air museum form the largest street art collective in Chile.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-a-cielo-abierto,"A vibrant collection of murals forms this striking open-air museum. It transforms an often unexplored area into a flourishing outdoor art gallery that’s now the largest street art collective in Chile. Artists from Chile and beyond turned the houses into their canvases while bringing the works to life. The art’s beauty goes far deeper than its popping colors and gorgeous images. It also gives a voice to the people who live in the neighborhood and lets them tell their stories and celebrate their cultures. In the 1960s, the neighborhood was built for working class people who moved into the metropolitan area while it was rapidly expanding. The people who lived there endured poverty and the political turmoil that arose after the 1973 coup. Years of pollution and neglect left many of the houses in rough shape. In 2009, two locals had the idea to use street art to refresh the buildings and bring new life to the older structures. The first mural was unveiled in 2010. Now, more than 40 line the streets, each one becoming an artistic backdrop to everyday life. Even though many are made by renowned artists, the locals still have a strong say in shaping what has now become an open-air museum. Themes of religion, environmental stewardship, and celebrating children are prominent.  To arrive, take the metro in the direction of the ""Departamental"" metro station (Line 2/Yellow) and walk westward for a few blocks.

213,Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA),"San Pedro de Atacama, Chile",One of the world's most advanced radio observatories sprawls across the Atacama Desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atacama-large-millimeter-array,"Chile is a popular place for telescopes because of its dry air, dark surroundings, and high elevation. It also helps that the southern sky is particularly interesting because it’s where you can see the Milky Way’s core. In addition to optical observation, Chile is also perfect for millimeter and radio observations due to the area’s low amounts of interfering radiation from things like cell phones and WiFi.  The biggest of such telescopes is the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The ALMA is 16,000 feet (5,000 meters) above sea level. The telescope consists of 66 antennas nearly 40 feet (12 meters) in diameter that work together to form a single gigantic dish stretching up to 10 miles (16 kilometers), giving astronomers much better resolutions than any other instrument can offer. With this telescope, astronomers use millimeter radiation’s ability to look right though obstructive features that would be opaque in optical wavelengths. This makes the instrument perfect for observing dust, protoplanetary disks, the solar atmosphere, and exoplanets.  ALMA is open for tours once a week, but you have to book your tour months in advance. The ALMA Array Operations Site where the antennas are located (at an elevation of 5000 m) is not open to the general public. The ALMA Operations Support Facility is open to visitors. If you are feeling lucky, you can take a chance and just show up at the tour time and hope that some who booked didn't show up.

It was named for Hiro, a Rapa Nui rain deity, and its musical capabilities bestowed it with sacred responsibilities. Villagers would blow into the natural hole at the top of the stone, creating a loud, breathy trumpeting sound. This was used for several purposes: to summon their neighbors for a gathering, aid in fertility (in spite of its phallic shape, the stone has some petroglyphs carved into it that resemble female genitalia), or coax fish to swim up to the shoreline. Pu o Hiro was revered for these perceived magic powers and traveled around the island as a trophy for the victors in battle. The stone has settled at its current location on the north coast of Easter Island, where it is fenced off to discourage tourists from attempting to sound the trumpet themselves.

During his third and final return to Chile, Neruda met Matilde Urrutia, and the two struck up a heated affair. By this time in Neruda’s life, he was a nationwide (if not worldwide) celebrity. Being caught having an affair would have been disastrous for his image. His answer was to construct la Chascona (“messy hair” in English) in Santiago, a house where he and Urrutia could be alone together. A notorious lover of the sea, Neruda built the dining room in the style of a captain’s cabin, and the living room to look like a lighthouse. He filled the home with works of art from friends and family including a painting given to Neruda by Urrutia that displays his face hidden in her famously curly locks. They would eventually wed and even be buried next to one another, leaving La Chascona as a symbol of their enduring love. The house is now in the hands of the Pablo Neruda Foundation in Chile. It is open for visitors, along with his other two Chilean homes. The home is a museum not just to Neruda’s final years, but also of his love of art and Matilde Urrutia.",poetry eccentric homes literature homes museums
217,Glacier Republic,"Natales, Chile",An unrecognized micronation declared by Greenpeace to protect the glaciers of Chile.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glacier-republic,"As climate change progresses, glaciers worldwide continue to melt, and Chile, which holds 82% of South America’s glaciated land, is no exception. In addition to warming temperatures, the glaciers of southern Chile are threatened by explosions and pollution caused by mining operations near and atop the glaciers—harmful practices that have prompted environmental advocacy group Greenpeace to take matters into its own hands. On March 5, 2014, Greenpeace declared a new country, the “Glacier Republic,” consisting of all 8,800 square miles of glaciated Chilean land. This bold environmental declaration was Greenpeace’s best attempt to protect Chilean glaciers from the unpunished corporate gold mining practices that pollute and excavate the ice at unsustainable rates. The reason for the previous lack of environmental protection in the area was that, according to Greenpeace Chile director Matías Asún, Chile’s Constitution and water code exluded glaciers as public goods in need of protection. According to Asún, this legal loophole gives Greenpeace the ability to lay claim to the icy expanse. Since the republic’s inception, Greenpeace has worked to ensure that the Glacier Republic can qualify as an actual nation. As of now, the unrecognized state has a population of over 165,000 petition signers, as well as a flag, a Declaration of Independence, a tent in the Andes serving as the capital, and 40 international embassies (conveniently located in Greenpeace’s international offices), satisfying all of the requirements for statehood outlined in the Montevideo Convention. The group pledges to maintain its claims to sovereignty until all mining near glaciated areas is completely abandoned, including the Chilean government’s proposed expansion of the Andina copper mine, which would, if enacted, destroy nearly 20 square miles of glaciers and contaminate the watershed that provides water for six million Chileans. As of today, the Glacier Republic is not recognized by any member of the United Nations, and unfortunately for Greenpeace, environmental protection has once again taken a back seat to economic opportunity.",micro-nations glaciers environment mines nature
218,Port Famine,"Punta Arenas, Chile",The geographical center of Chile is a port so depressing that it has driven men to suicide.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/port-famine,"Port Famine, or Puerto del Hambre, lies in Patagonia, Chile, on the north shore of the Strait of Magellan, making it the exact geographical center of the country if Chile’s Antarctic claims are taken into account. It is a bleak, cold, and astonishing place, more fit for sea-lions than humans. The rocky terrain was first settled in 1584 by Captain Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, who established the City of King Philip, or Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe. 337 settlers, including women, children, and two Franciscan priests, claimed this corner of the world for Spain, with little more than hope and a gigantic wooden crucifix to sustain them. Unfortunately the odds, and the terrain, were always against the city. Few of the settlers understood how to grow food in such conditions, and even fewer knew what lay in wait for them in the harsh seasons of the year. Without the proper knowledge to prevent them, one after another, illness, rodents, bitter cold, and crop failure struck the settlement, and in the end, most of the residents either froze or starved to death. When Thomas Cavendish, a British privateer, finally came upon the settlement only three years later, not a single one of the original inhabitants was left alive, finding only 18 malnourished people at the site. Cavendish appropriately renamed the place Port Famine, or Puerto del Hambre, and made his camp some ways from the site of the ruined settlement. The bleak coast remained largely unvisited until the HMS Beagle came to the port in August 1828. Receiving orders that he and his ship were to stay in the area for a full five years of surveying, the ship’s captain, Pringle Stokes, was driven to despair and shot himself after hiding in his cabin for 14 days. HIs body was buried near the port in a small English cemetery which still stands as a reminder of the despair caused by the surroundings. Despite the tragic and depressing history of the port, the ruins of the original 1584 settlement, now not much more than some low-lying church ruins, have been named a national landmark and multiple monuments have been erected to honor the various explorers and settlers who perished on the bleak shores. This site is closed to the public. No date was given to reopen.",naval history geographic markers ruins
219,Enrique Molina Theater,"Concepción, Chile",The ruins of a grand theater destroyed during the most powerful seismic catastrophe ever recorded.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/enrique-molina-theater,"Ruined by the foreshocks of the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, this once-grand neoclassical theater serves as a permanent reminder of the seismic threats constantly haunting Chile. After just 25 years as a performance venue, the Enrique Molina Theatre was destroyed by a series of four devastating earthquakes in May 1960, which unleashed a quarter of the 20th century’s total global seismic energy on Southern Chile in just 33 hours. The three Concepción quakes—which measured up to a magnitude 8.3—were shortly followed by the record-breaking magnitude 9.6 Valdivia earthquake. The catastrophic rumblings reduced a third of Concepción’s buildings to no more than ruins and rubble. The Enrique Molina Theatre ruins are a sobering relic of this natural disaster. The once-grand neoclassical theater was meant to be an architectural and cultural treasure, until nature made other plans for its fate. It was named after the co-founder of The University of Concepción, Enrique Molina Garmendia. It was originally intended as a college theater for another of Molina Garmendia’s educational enterprises, the Concepción Men’s College (Liceo de Hombres de Concepción). A movement to salvage the grand theater gained support during the beginning of the 21st century. An architect was chosen, and local government funding for the restoration was secured in 2009, a year which saw the ruins declared a National Historical Monument. Sadly, in 2010, a magnitude 8.8 earthquake shook Concepción again, causing further damage to the already precarious edifice. Municipal funds for the theater’s reconstruction were redirected elsewhere after the 2010 earthquake, leaving a once-beautiful theatre in a state of poetic decay at the heart of Chile’s quake-prone second city. The ruins are located on Avenida Victor Lamas, one of the city's main thoroughfares, and are opposite the large and attractive Parque Ecuador city park. Urban Explorers beware; the ruins could be dangerous to enter and are fenced off from the road, but views to the interior of this once opulent neoclassical structure can still be enjoyed safely from the sidewalk.",earthquakes theaters disasters ruins

221,The Dissidents Cemetery,"Valparaiso, Chile",This historic Chilean cemetery is the burial place of hundreds of European and American freethinkers and non-Catholics.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-dissidents-cemetery-valparaiso-chile,"On a picturesque hilltop in the colorful port town of Valparaiso, Chile, lies one of South America’s most historic and beautiful cemeteries. Yet few of its early burials are native South Americans. Cementerio Disidentes (The Cemetery of Dissidents) is the final resting place for hundreds of European and North American Protestants, freethinkers, and other non-Catholics who died in this “skinny country,” and their descendents, who still call Chile home. Today, we don’t tend to think of Latin America as an immigration hub. But in the 1800s, Chile, Argentina and Brazil attracted many new settlers from abroad, including quite a few whose native tongue wasn’t Spanish or Portuguese. Argentina and Chile, in fact, are mostly immigrant nations. In Chile, it’s not at all uncommon to see place names with a familiar English or German ring. Walk around the historic Pacific seaport town of Valparaiso and you’ll find streets with names like Edwards, Cumming, Mackenna, Mackay, and even one named Calle Beethoven. Other city thoroughfares were given the Spanish names for western European countries, including Calle Dinamarca, “Denmark Street,” where you’ll find the Dissidents Cemetery. Chilean Patagonia, at South America’s farthest tip, was heavily explored by British sailors. It too has a litany of English place names, spots like Cerro Fitzroy, Isla Wellington, the Beagle Channel, which opens into Darwin Sound. Then there’s that curious red-headed Irishman, Bernardo O’Higgins, who you can think of as Chile’s George Washington. O’Higgins was the bastard son of Ambrosio O’Higgins, a poor Irish tenant farmer from County Sligo who emigrated to the other side of the world and happened to become the Viceroy of Peru. In the early 19th century, the Valparaiso port town was a major destination for globe-trotting mariners. The list of visitors who came by sea includes Charles Darwin, father of evolutionary biology, who docked here aboard the HMS Beagle in 1834. British sailors and adventurers formed a major nucleus of the Chilean navy during its war of independence against Spain, and then again in the early days of the Chilean Republic. One was Lord Thomas Cochrane, who had already served with distinction in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. Cochrane, humiliated by a financial scandal in England at war’s end, became a Chilean citizen in 1818, then served as Vice Admiral of the Chilean Navy. American sailors were no strangers to Valparaiso’s harbor, either.  One monument at the Dissidents Cemetery honors a battle of the far-flung War of 1812, America’s “Second War of Independence.”  On March 24, 1814, the frigate USS Essex, under command of Admiral David Porter, went into battle against the British vessels HMS Phoebe and HMS Cherub just offshore. Porter lost the battle and 58 American sailors died.  (One sailor aboard the Essex was the future Civil War admiral David Farragut, famous for later coining the phrase, “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!” during the siege of Mobile, Alabama, in 1864.) Valparaiso also holds a minor spot in American history and literature: Writer Herman Melville, whose seafaring days in the South Pacific took him here, opens his anti-slavery novel “Benito Cereno” off the Chilean coast. Unfortunately, until an 1883 law did away with religious discrimination in Chile’s cemeteries, if you died in Chile and weren’t Catholic, your bones couldn’t legally be buried in “holy ground.”  Thus, for most of the 19th century, non-Catholics who expired even as far away as Santiago and La Serena had to be brought to Valparaiso for burial at the Protestant Cemetery, established in 1823 by British consul George Seymour.  The cemetery, or “Protestant Pantheon,” popped up next to what was originally the old city jail.  Before 1823, non-Catholics had been buried in the fort on Cordillera Hill or, since many of them were sailors, were simply buried at sea. Since most of the deceased hailed originally from the British Isles, this lovely necropolis feels a bit like the old British Empire — with the added touch of South American light and Latin grace.  A large number of these stones are carved in English.  Poke around a bit and you’ll find the Royal Naval vault, final resting place of several dozen British sailors who died here as far as back as the 1850s, not long after Charles Darwin’s visit. Not all the grave markers are in English, though.  Many are in German and at least one is in Swedish.  (One stone German cross is inscribed “Ruhe Sanft,” “Sleep tight.”) Equally interesting are the “multilingual” stones. As different nationalities settled down in Chile, families intermarried, just like in every other immigrant nation. Surnames that came from England, Germany, Italy, Scotland or Eastern Europe began to take on a certain Spanish inflection. When women married, they added a “de” to their surnames, even if their husband’s name was, say, Scottish. One stone here memorializes a Mrs. Flora McGaw de Shaw. Reverend David Trumbull, founder of the Presbyterian Church in Chile, was buried here, as was Henry Osborn Burdon, veteran of the Battle of Waterloo, who died in South America in 1848.  An especially curious grave marker is a memorial to the city’s German-speaking fire department, the Deutsche Spritzenkompagnie. Look around and you’ll find some of the native sons and daughters of Edinburgh, Philadelphia, Stuttgart, and London, all resting here on a sunny South American hillside. Don’t miss the monument near the entrance, written in old English lettering: “Immigrant’s Memorial Square.” The Dissidents Cemetery is about a 15- or 20-minute walk from the popular Cerro Alegre district. Gates are open 10am - 5pm. A neighboring museum sheds some light on the town's fascinating immigrant history. Cementerio Disidentes is one of the most interesting off-the-beaten-path locations in Valparaiso. Even if you're not interested in cemeteries, it's one of the best places to get a view of this gorgeous city. Two neighboring Catholic burial grounds, including the imposing, neoclassical Cementerio Numero 2 just across the street, are a little more flowery and are also worth checking out.",immigration cemeteries history
222,Museo de Sitio (In Situ Museum),"Arica, Chile",Walk on a glass floor suspended over ancient mummified remains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-de-sitio-in-situ-museum,"While excavating an old private home in 2004 with the plan to turn the building into a hotel, construction workers in Arica, Chile, came across the remains of a mummy. Further excavation revealed a total of 32 mummies, meaning the entire crawl space of the house was atop an ancient cemetery. The mummies were Chinchorro people who lived on a section of the southern Peruvian and northern Chilean shore from 7020 to 1110 BC. Chinchorro mummies, the oldest in the world, are common in this area, in large part because the arid soil of the Atacama Desert is rich in nitrate salts, which both dry and preserve organic materials. Rather than move the remains, the owner helped transform the site into a small museum. The mummies, along with their funerary objects, were left in place, and a glass floor was built over them so visitors can walk above and closely view the exposed remains. Archaeologists have discovered several more layers of mummies beneath these. Upstairs from the “in situ” cemetery, a covered terrace overlooks the expanse of the town and leads to a small room with panels and displays that describe the lives of the Chinchorro, and the elaborate method they often used to mummify their dead. They made them into virtual statues by first removing  the skin, soft tissue, and organs from the body and replacing the body’s internal parts with combinations of ashes, animal hair, mud, and vegetable matter. After placing sticks along sides of the bones, they covered the body with a paste of white-ash, reattached the skin, and painted the entire body. Finally, they placed a clay mask over the face, and covered the scalp with a wig.  Cards with written explanation are available in Spanish and English and the wall behind the in situ cemetery explains the unique attributes for each mummy.",mummies death museums
223,La Sebastiana,"Valparaiso, Chile",Pivotal home of Nobel Prize winner Pablo Neruda.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-sebastiana,"When searching for a coastal respite in Valparaíso, Pablo Neruda related the following specifications to his friend, Sara Vial, “It may not be too high or too low. It must be solitary, but not in excess. I wish neighbors were invisible. I wish I did not see or hear them. Original but not uncomfortable. Very light, but firm. Neither too big nor too small, far from everything. But close to the stores. As well, it has to be very inexpensive. Do you think I can find a house like that in Valparaíso?” Miraculously, “La Sebastiana” fit the vast majority of his requirements. Originally constructed by Spaniard Sebastián Collao, the structure brimmed with character. The third floor had been a birdhouse, the terrace had been created to serve as a heliport, and the house was capped by a tower. Windows with pristine views of the ocean and city resembled ships’ clerestories. The one drawback: Neruda felt it was too large. After three years of finishing and quirkily furnishing the house, Neruda and his third wife, Matilde Urrutia, moved in with joint-owners and close friends Doctor Francisco Velasco and his wife. It was agreed that Neruda and Urrutia would occupy the top two floors and tower while Velasco and Martner would reside in the lower portion of the house. Neruda later joked that he had gotten the worse half of the bargain, “I bought nothing but stairs and terraces,” knowing full-well that these features afforded him a nearly 360-degree vista of the bay. La Sebastiana served as the poet’s residence at the time he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Neruda was so greatly inspired by his dwelling that he penned a poem in her honor, I established the house. First I made it from air. Then I hung the flag in the air and left it hanging from the sky, from the star from clarity and from darkness… And so it remained until Neruda’s death. However, immediately following the military coup in 1973, La Sebastiana was ransacked in retaliation for Neruda’s outspoken support of the previous regime. Thanks to private and public funding the house was returned to its original condition and an interpretive center was created in the garden area, both of which opened to the public in 1991.

Some believe he killed himself after suffering a broken heart. Now, at both the entrance and exit to the tunnel, makeshift shrines have formed to young Willy. Visitors leave gifts of all kinds and whisper wishes and favors into the tunnel, believing his spirit will grant them. Specifically, you’ll see many blue pinwheels left at the tunnel.

225,La Picá de Clinton,"Santiago, Chile",How a lunch counter in Chile became a shrine to the 42nd president of the United States,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-pica-de-clinton,"In April 1998, Chile hosted the second-ever Summit of the Americas. Presidents and prime ministers from throughout the Western hemisphere gathered to meet with their fellow leaders in Chile’s capital city of Santiago. After one summit session held at Santiago’s Municipal Theater, the assembled leaders began climbing into their limousines to return to their hotels. However, American President Bill Clinton deviated from his schedule and surprised his aides by heading to a nearby restaurant instead. The San Remo was a type of basic restaurant known in Chile as a picada (or picá), a simple place serving inexpensive dishes such as sandwiches and french fries. It had been a slow day for the restaurant, as the security barriers for the summit kept many of its regular customers away. That changed in an instant when server María Ximena Provoste noticed the approach of Clinton, surrounded by a pack of reporters. She greeted the president and offered him a bottle of Diet Coke. Clinton requested a glass, and Provoste brought one, quickly wiping it with a cloth. The president shook hands and signed autographs around the room while sipping his soda. After about 15 minutes, once he had met everyone, Clinton departed the quiet San Remo and returned to the world’s television screens and headlines. After the president’s visit, the San Remo quickly rebranded with the name it still uses today: “La Picá de Clinton.” Clinton photographs and related news clippings adorn the walls, and the presidential Coke bottle and glass are displayed in a case above the counter. Even a “Clinton hot dog” has appeared on the menu, overloaded (as hot dogs always are in Chile) with toppings such as sauerkraut, tomatoes, mayonnaise, and mustard. Years later, those who were present that day are still amazed that a world leader suddenly appeared in their humble establishment. They recall the presidential visit fondly—even though, as Provoste told reporters, “he didn’t leave a tip.”",political provisions soda presidents politics

Since 1980, Plaza Acevedo has been home to the Museo de Historia Natural, Concepción’s natural history museum that dates back to 1902. In 2008 the museum installed several full-size fiberglass dinosaurs, and the foliage of the Plaza was re-landscaped to create a habitat for the giant beasts—so much so, the park is now more commonly known as La Plaza de Dinosaurios (Dinosaur Plaza) or simply, La Plaza Jurásica (Jurassic Plaza). The showpiece of the installation is the 65-foot-long, 26-foot-tall Diplodocus, but not to be outdone by a lanky herbivore, there is a full-scale 20-foot Tyrannosaurus rex just behind. Suspended from tall trees by thick wire there is a swooping Pterosaur with a 20-foot wingspan, and some dinosaur eggs just bursting open. The park was originally named for a famous Chilean aviator named Luis Acevedo Acevedo, who died in a plane crash not far from the city. Two years after the invasion of the dinosaurs, Concepción was hit by a devastating 8.8 magnitude earthquake, which the sculptures defied, coming through with only minor fractures. The square is free and open to the public, and the museum is small, but worth a visit too.

227,Monument to the Indigenous People,"Santiago, Chile",This sculpture meant to honor the bravery of the Indigenous Mapuche people of Chile proved controversial.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-the-indigenous-people-monumento-al-pueblo-indigena,"In Santiago’s main square stands a striking sculpture called the Monument to the Indigenous People (Monumento a los Pueblos Indígenas). Rising 26 feet tall, the concrete-and-granite monument was created by renowned Chilean sculptor Enrique E. Villalobos Sandoval. It’s comprised of three elements: some vegetation, a seed, and a human face. The last of these proved to be particularly controversial, as it depicts the broken face of a Mapuche man. Although the monument was intended to be an homage to the bravery of the Mapuche people, the indigenous inhabitants of south-central Chile, the fact the face appears to be broken left room for misinterpretation. The unveiling of the monument in October 1992, as a commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the Americas, did not help deter criticism. The Mapuche people fought against the Spanish conquistadores for 350 years. Before the arrival of the Spaniards they were a group of loosely connected farming communities with a minimal overarching political structure. But starting in the 16th century, the Mapuche radically restructured their societies to become a military force to fight against the foreign invaders. Their struggle outlived the Spanish Empire and continued well after Chile’s declaration of independence in 1818. Upon gaining independence, the Chilean government forced the Mapuche into reservations, where, by and large, they reverted back to farming. Under this situation, their ownership of the land was protected by law. But in a questionable move in the 1980s, the Chilean government transferred land ownership from the collective to Mapuche individuals. Having used the land as collateral for borrowing money, many Mapuche people have lost their land and livelihood, and more are likely to follow. Often discriminated against by other Chileans on top of that, the Mapuche fight continues to this day. Against this backdrop, it’s not too surprising that controversy welcomed the unveiling of a monument representing the fractured face of a Mapuche man, on the anniversary of the conquistadors’ arrival in Chile.  The monument is located in the Plaza de Armas in central Santiago, accessible 24/7.",indigenous colonialism monuments sculptures history
228,Malleco Viaduct,"Collipulli, Chile",This bright yellow bridge is a true engineering feat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/malleco-viaduct,"Big, bold, bright yellow, and resembling a giant childs’ construction set, the stunning Malleco viaduct soars above the rapids of the Rio Malleco in Collipulli. When it was constructed in 1890, it was considered the tallest railway bridge in the world. It has survived numerous earthquakes and still carries rail traffic between the north and south of Chile today. Building the viaduct was deemed important for the rapid economic development, colonization, and consolidation of the newly conquered lands in the south of Chile, which were taken from the Mapuche tribe during the campaign of the Occupation of Araucanía, which ended in 1883. The concept of spanning a gorge in such a seismically active region with a steel bridge was the idea of Chilean engineer Victorino Aurelio Lastarria. Chile’s President José Manuel Balmaceda tasked the French ambassador to find the best engineers in Europe to submit designs to realize Aurelio Lastarria’s plan. A popular local belief holds that Gustave Eiffel, the architect who designed the Eiffel tower in Paris, was the successful architect. But in fact, though Eiffel did indeed submit a proposal to the Chilean government for the viaduct, the project was awarded to a rival Parisian architect Schneider et Cie. O Le Creusot. Unbelievably, the steel framework of the bridge was constructed in sections in France and shipped to Chile before being transported by train on the then-incomplete railroad to the site for assembly. At 1,140 feet long, the 335-foot-high steel bridge is thought to weigh an excess off 1,500 tons. Today, it’s a designated Chilean National Monument and is included on UNESCO’s tentative list for Chile. The viaduct is easily visible from the neigboring road bridge on the Ruta 5 Highway, which forms Chile's part of the Panamerican highway, just south of the town of Collipulli. For a closer look, leave the Ruta 5 at Collipulli and take the R-336 where there is a dedicated viewpoint and tourist information.",railroads infrastructure transportation
229,Nao Victoria Museum,"Punta Arenas, Chile",A display of hand-built replicas of the legendary vessels used by Patagonian and Antarctic explorers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nao-victoria-museum,"Rising unexpectedly from an industrial park by the windswept shores of the Strait of Magellan is a full-size replica of Ferdinand Magellan’s Nao Victoria carrack, the first ship to circumnavigate the Earth. The replica is the earliest in a series of four marvelous maritime models at this surprisingly poignant museum. After the public was first invited aboard in 2011, this impressive replica was joined by a replica of the Chilean Schooner, the Ancud. Under the captaincy of John Williams Wilson, the original Ancud undertook the voyage that claimed the Strait of Magellan, a tortuous sea passage between the Atlantic and Pacific, for the Chilean Republic in 1843. Building on the success of these first floating facsimiles, the museum commissioned a replica of the tiny lifeboat that saved Ernest Shackleton’s team of British polar explorers from an Antarctic shipwreck, followed by a full scale reproduction of Charles Darwin’s HMS Beagle, which extensively surveyed the cruel seas around Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia in the 19th century. The Beagle’s first captain, Pringle Stokes, died by suicide while surveying this harsh and unforgiving environment and is buried at nearby Puerto del Hambre (Port Famine). The painstakingly faithful replica vessels are complemented by static and dynamic displays intended to give visitors an insight into the hardships endured by the pioneering sailors, explorers, and scientists who risked their lives in some of Earth’s most treacherous stretches of water.  The museum is en route from Punta Arenas Airport to the city center and one of the first sights to greet visitors entering the city from the North.

230,Pablo Fierro Museum,"Puerto Varas, Chile",This fairytale house on the shore of a Chilean Lake oozes an eclectic mix of Chilote and German Cultural heritage.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pablo-fierro-museum,"Curated and largely constructed by Artist Pablo Fierro, this creaky gallery and museum sprouts cuckoo clocks, candy canes, classic cars, and the bow of a traditional fishing vessel that bursts from its fantasy frontage. The fairytale-like building highlights the region’s human history. The area around Lake Llanquihue in Chile’s stunning Lake District is characterized by a surprising fusion of the traditional Chilote culture of the Chiloé Archipelago with that of the German farmers who made this corner of South America their home in the 1850s. This unique heritage is celebrated in a diverse collection of art and artifacts relating to these seemingly disparate cultures housed in the striking gingerbread cottage-esque lakeside house. A large wooden sign at the entrance to the house reads “El Arte de Soñar,” meaning “The Art of Dreaming.” Born in Temuco, in the Araucania region of Southern Chile, curator Pablo Fierro began painting the iconic German-style architecture of the region in the 1990s, and in 2002, began converting this old lakeside property into its current dreamlike form, principally as as a gallery for his artwork. Very little in the museum is off-limits, and curious callers are invited to touch and play with the antiques and artifacts collected within.  The Museum is free to enter, and is a short stroll along the waterfront from the Plaza de Armas of Puerto Varas on the 225 Road heading towards Ensenada.",gallery houses homes architectural oddities museums and collections art museums architecture

The artifacts, many of them donated by collector Sergio Larraín García-Moreno, are displayed in the beautifully restored, three-story Royal Customs House, which was constructed in 1807. In addition to everyday clothing and ceramics, some of the more unique pieces include ceramic whistling jars and a Chinchorro mummy from the Chilean northern coast dating to 1900 BC. Also throughout the museum, visitors will also the opportunity to marvel at Mapuche totem poles used to mark graves, each carved from a single tree and vomitivos, or vomit spatulas, which were used to induce ritual purging. Perhaps one of the museums most bizarre sculptures is that of Xipe Totec “Our Lord the Flayed One,” god of agriculture and fertility. Xipe Totec is said to have given his skin to save humanity. During the Spring Equinox, priests would remove the hearts from slaves or captives then carefully flay the skins from their bodies. The priests would then wear these skins for ceremonies over the next 20 days to emulate how growing seeds shed their skins to bring new life into the world.

232,Villa Baviera,"Villa Baviera, Chile","Formerly a brutal Nazi colony, this Chilean village was remade as a (controversial) German-themed tourist trap.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/villa-baviera,"Miles away from civilization and accessible only by a gravel road is Villa Baviera, a quaint tourist town in Chile that appears to be typical of other European-themed villages throughout the world… that is, until you look closer. Past the Bavarian facades and German sausages lies a deeper backstory that reveals a sinister past of censorship, torture, and white nationalism. In 1959, former Nazi sergeant Paul Schäfer was charged by the West German government with two counts of sexually abusing young children and was forced to flee European land as a fugitive. By 1961, Schäfer and a few hundred of his closest followers had successfully escaped to form Colonia Dignidad (Dignity Colony), an isolated, rural town in the Andean foothills of eastern Chile. While the Nazi immigrants painted their Chilean colony as a communal agricultural utopia to the rest of the world, their propaganda couldn’t have been farther from the truth. Colonia Dignidad claimed to be a Christian charity providing free healthcare to Chileans affected by a recent earthquake, but in reality it was an authoritarian Nazi police state with guardhouses, lookout towers, and a complete restriction of emigration. Under Schäfer’s rule, connection to the outside world was strictly limited, with a ban on calendars, computers, and TVs. The Nazi leader employed a cult of personality; eventually, all of his followers thought of him as God, referring to him as “Der Permanente Onkel,” or The Permanent Uncle. Every aspect of human life was controlled at Colonia Dignidad. Sex wasn’t allowed unless approved by Schäfer, and families were separated from birth into gender-segregated groups of 6 to 15. Laborers worked without pay and those who broke the colony’s strict laws were tortured with electrocution and beatings. Schäfer even collaborated with Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who used the colony as a detention camp to torture and execute his political prisoners. But by the 1990s, things at Colonia Dignidad began to change. Democracy was brought to Chile and by 1997 Schäfer fled Chile under charges of torture, amassing weapons, and committing pedophilia against the children of the colony. Nowadays, the colony is no longer under Schäfer’s Nazi rule and has been renamed “Villa Baviera,” a controversial tourist town that has purportedly moved on from its Nazi-dominated past. Featuring a manmade pond, Hotel Baviera, and the Zippelhaus Restaurant, located in renovated versions of Schäfer’s original architecture, Villa Baviera is the former Nazi colony’s best attempt to move forward from its rough past with a positive, German-themed tourist appeal minutes away from the Andes. The sheds and slave workshops of the old Colonia Dignidad remain standing to this day, forcing the waiters and innkeepers, who are the descendents of the original Nazis, to try to explain to tourists that their ideologies have evolved from those of their parents. Hidden far away from urban life and offering music, Oktoberfest celebrations, painted Bavarian cottages, and traditional European meals, Villa Baviera is the home to a few dozen tourists each week, all of which ponder on whether the controversial tourist town shows a positive outlook for the future or if it profits off of its brutal Nazi history.",utopias cults tourism nazis
233,Churches of Chiloé,"Castro, Chile",Spanish religion mixed with local architecture has yielded a network of churches unlike any other.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/churches-of-chiloe,"The isolated archipelago of Chiloé is home to a distinctive local culture consisting of a mish-mash of Spanish and indigenous traditions — embodied most strikingly in the beautiful churches of Chiloé. Hidden in the mists just off the coast of Chile, Chiloé seems almost like a little slice of Ireland plopped into the chilly waters of the southern Pacific. Rolling green hills dotted with fluffy sheep, Chilotes (as locals are called) clothed in thick woolen garments stoking fires in wood-shingled houses along the shoreline, strong and hearty food and drink that fills the stomach and strengthens the soul, and everywhere a strong sense of community and identity. On clear days, the mighty peaks of Andean volcanoes on the mainland can be seen piercing the horizon. When Spanish Jesuits first came to the islands at the beginning of the 17th century they initiated a peripatetic mission, travelling from village to village and island to island to spread Christianity. In so doing, they worked with local builders in each location they visited to erect churches that would be looked after by indigenous laypeople when they missionaries weren’t in residence. These churches are perhaps the greatest examples of a wholly unique style of architecture known as the Chilota School. Unlike classical Spanish Colonial buildings, the churches are architecturally significant for being made entirely of native wood, specifically making use of wood shingles on the roof and walls. Some of the churches weren’t even originally made with nails, using wooden pegs instead. The overall style is distinctive to Chiloé as a way to keep out the perpetual cold and damp of southern Chile. Many construction techniques were borrowed directly from local boat-building traditions, and the churches were generally built on high ground to be easily seen by seafaring navigators, and to prevent flooding. Non-religious festivals and community activities were usually held at the churches. Altogether, about 70 churches were constructed in this style throughout Chiloé. The main cathedral, the Church of San Francisco, is located on the Plaza de Armas in Chiloé’s capital city of Castro. The design is different from the other churches on the islands, employing more of a Neo-Gothic style. Soaring buttressed ceilings made of amber wood glow in the daylight, lending the church a feeling of warmth and security. The outside is made from galvanized iron that is painted a radiant yellow, with accents of purple, white, and red. The other churches are all characterized by a facade tower, basilican layout, and vaulted ceiling, as well as the aforementioned timber construction and peculiar jointing techniques. The facades are generally either painted a strong central color with accent colors, or are left blank, letting the bare craftsmanship speak for itself. Inside, the woodwork features simple designs and colors, such as the church in Chonchi, whose ceiling is a faded blue dotted with white stars. The well-worn floorboards barely creak as visitors shuffle around inside the churches, quietly admiring the subtle beauty and native artistic mastery of the churches al fin del mundo (at the end of the world.) Sixteen of the churches were chosen to be UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2000, with many others distinguished as national heritage landmarks by the government of Chile. Today, they are some of the most popular tourist destinations on the islands, with many opportunities for tours as well as personal exploration of the beautiful churches of Chiloé. The main cathedral can be found in the center of Castro. Directly across the street is the tourist information office, where interested parties can find information, tours, and brochures for visiting the other churches.",islands churches sacred spaces architecture

235,Cementerio Numero 3 de Playa Ancha,"Valparaiso, Chile",Hand-made memorials and a wish-granting murderer lie within this seaside pauper's cemetery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cementerio-numero-3-de-playa-ancha,"In a wide field overlooking the ocean in Chile’s second-largest city, there are home-made mausoleums unlike any others in the country, and a shrine to a local murderer-turned-martyr who might be persuaded to give you his good graces. Construction on Cementerio Numero 3 de Playa Ancha, in the city of Valparaíso, began in 1868. Cemeteries 1 and 2, the resting places for well-off porteños, were now enveloped by the development of the growing port city. As the population boomed, a third location was chosen further afield for the poor and the working class. In the mid-19th century, Chile was a young country commanding an important trade route. Valparaíso was its principal port, and it was enjoying a golden era. The Straits of Magellan in Patagonia were the safest way for steamships to cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and the city was the first major stop on the Pacific leg. The country on land was also isolated by the world’s driest desert in the north and the Andes in the east, so the port was its key point of connection to the rest of the world. Valparaíso filled with European immigrants looking to make a buck in the thriving economy, particularly as the California Gold Rush pulled ships to the west through the 1840s and 50s. The Cementerio de Playa Ancha provided a place to inter the deceased of these incoming masses. Surviving into the modern day, it now includes a “German quarter,” which features a mix of international surnames and architectural styles representing a wide range of regions and eras. The most striking feature of the cemetery, though, is its fields of cunas and corrales. Meaning cribs and corrals, these are the makeshift memorials of those who couldn’t afford a fancier plot. They resemble the mausoleums constructed for those who can afford it privately, or those who are buried collectively in tombs owned by unions and social societies. They are mostly made out of wood or metal (or in some cases literally a cast-off baby’s crib), and decorated with photos, keepsakes, and other souvenirs of the deceased. While these assemblies bring to mind altars from Mexico’s Día de Muertos, no such tradition exists in Chile. Somewhat similar home-made grave decorations are also found in fishing regions in the southern part of the country, indicating that there may be a link between the traditions of various indigenous cultures. But in general the history remains unclear. The cunas and corrales are today unique to Valparaíso’s working classes. The single most famous grave in the cemetery is probably the animita of Emile Dubois. An animita, another blend of indigenous and colonial beliefs, is a shrine to someone who died tragically or violently and is thought to remain in contact with the world of the living. In the case of Dubois, that death was by firing squad. The shrine is covered with hundreds of inscribed plaques thanking Dubois for his help. If you come at the right time you might cross paths with someone saying a prayer or leaving a note asking for intervention.",crime crime and punishment graveyards cemeteries
236,Chacabuco,"Sierra Gorda, Chile",This abandoned nitrate town was repurposed as a dictator's prison.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chacabuco,"When driving through Chile, you may notice abandoned buildings lining the more desolate roads. They’re the remains of nitrate towns, settlements that cropped up to house the workers who toiled in the mines. Chacabuco was a nitrate town founded in 1924. It could house 5,000 workers and included facilities like a theater, library, pool, and sports center. But the town was short-lived. The Great Depression in the United States, as well as Germany’s invention of synthetic nitrate, hindered the industry. After the area’s mines began closing in the 1930s, the workers began abandoning the town. It then became a time capsule of sorts, though looters did pilfer its materials until the government declared it a national monument and began protecting it in 1971. The town was soon given a new purpose, thanks to the 1973 Coup d’État made by General Augusto Pinochet. During his regime, Pinochet turned part of the city into a prison and torture camp for male intellectuals who opposed the government. The camp held around 1,800 prisoners during its two-year use, many of whom died there. After the prison closed, Chacabuco was abandoned once more. It continued to deteriorate until several preservation attempts were made in 1990. A former prisoner of the camp, Roberto Saldívar, chose to return there and live in the camp alone to preserve and protect it. He kept doing this until his death in 2006. After, that Pedro Barreda took over Saldívar’s job as caretaker. As of July 2019, he still lives there.  The town is just a few minutes off from the route 5 and 25 crossings and is well signposted.

237,La Silla Observatory,Chile,The Chilean mountain is freckled with (relatively) small European telescopes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-silla-observatory,"Because of its high mountains, dry air, and relative lack of air pollution, Chile is a mecca for astronomers. European astronomers have planted their telescopes there since 1969. La Silla, a mountain close to the town of La Serena, was the first site in the country to house a European telescope. Even today, the mountain remains littered with telescopes that belong(ed) to various European countries. This is unique because in the late 20th century, telescope technology allowed only for relatively small telescopes of about 3.2 feet in diameter—sizes that are huge for non-professional astronomers, but tiny for those who are used to 28-foot or even 35-foot telescopes. Many of the small telescopes on the mountain are no longer used or have been replaced by robotic scanners that work in tandem with other small telescopes to look for exoplanets or supernovas. The largest telescope present is the monstrous 3.6m telescope and the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) that are both still very popular among astronomers in taking astronomical spectra.  There are weekly tours to the mountain that are free of charge, which allow you a chance to visit the NTT and the 3.6m telescope and get general information about the site in the visitor center. You have to book well in advance though (some suggest about 6 months) and re-confirm 10 days before the visit.",telescopes observatories astronomy science

Kcymaerxthaere is an art project created by Eames Demetrios. A series of plaques and other markers around the world honor events that have taken place in a parallel universe that, according to Demetrios, “co-exists to some degree with ours.” Most of these installations are bronze or stone plaques inscribed with stories but some are larger, even entire buildings. As of 2021, there are more than 140 sites spread across six continents and 30 countries. It was Culev Larsze alone against the Gods and yet they were no match for her sharp mind, in the arguments at least. But soon after her she got her way, it looked like they would have the last laugh after all. Because it was then she made her only mistake–she started to smirk. The Gods realized she had tricked them and so they took their revenge swiftly. Kmpass, the Urgend God of Directionality, told her that they would take away her gift of language–she could not even talk to herself until she spoke without words to one with words. They set her down on this hillside, overlooking the gap she had inspired. She looked in a pool of water at her reflection and she could see herself struggle to speak, but she could not even articulate her own loneliness. It was the darkest time, the emptiest time.  And so her journey to lift the curse began.

It forlornly bobs in the wake of passing pleasure craft in water barely deep enough for it to float, somewhat distant from the markets and floating restaurants that make the city’s waterfront popular with tourists. Named after John Thomond O’Brien, an Irishman who fought in the Chilean Wars of Independence, this retired Chilean submarine-turned-museum was once home to 70 crew and could submerge to a depth of 650 feet with a range of over 10,000 miles. The O’Brien was built near Glasgow in 1971. It was one of 27 Oberon Class submarines built in Scotland for the navies of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Chile. After decommissioning from the Chilean Navy in 2001, it began a new life as an unlikely static visitor attraction in the decidedly non-naval city of Valdivia, having been gifted to the municipality by the armed forces. It was hoped that the freshwater of Valdivia’s Calle-Calle River would better protect the ageing hull from corrosion than a more fitting saltwater location would have done. Daily guided tours of the O’Brien are available for small groups of hard hat-wearing tourists. Led by a guide, visitors are invited to enter the world of the ‘70s submariner via two steep ladders. The tour takes in the torpedo rooms, the unfeasibly cramped accommodation, the galley, and the dark and stuffy control and engine rooms of the sub. As a reminder of the submarine’s European provenance, space-age dials, gauges, buttons, and instrument panels bearing the markers of defunct British engineering companies stick out of the bulkheads of the claustrophobic craft at jaunty angles. Low ceilings frequently remind the unwary visitor why they were presented with hard hats at the beginning of the 40-minute tour. Several guided tours are available each day. Tickets can be purchased from a booth adjacent to the submarine on the quayside. Tours last 40 minutes, and take place every 50 minutes throughout the day with a break for lunch. Times are advertised on the website. Tours of the sub are only suitable for fit people wearing flat, closed shoes as access is via a steep ladder.

All, that is, except for one: Botica Salcobrand on Plaza Aníbal Pinto, where picking up a prescription is like taking a trip back in time. The opening of a new Salcobrand pharmacy in Chile would rarely garner much attention. But when the Botica Salcobrand opened in a historic building on Plaza Aníbal Pinto in 2012, residents of Valparaiso, along with local media, were eager to pop in for a look. This was all thanks to the design of the new drugstore, one which recreated the look and feel of a pharmacy from the 1900s. The Botica Salcobrand sells the same drugs, toothbrushes, shampoos, and sunscreens as all the other stores in the chain, but everything else inside reflects a bygone era. The shelves and stands are all made of wood, and atop the wooden counter sits an antique cash register. Old glass bottles and containers, typical of pharmacies from the early 1900s, sit in rows between antique lamps. Even the staff is dressed in old fashioned uniforms, and if you speak to the make-up department, you’ll be invited to sit in and old barber’s chair to discuss your pending purchase. It’s a real trip back in time and a stark contrast to typical drugstores with their bright lights and clinical aspect. Even better, there’s a tearoom further inside where you can sit back, relax, and sample more than 60 varieties of tea.

242,World's Largest Coca-Cola Logo,"Arica, Chile","70,000 empty bottles of Coke comprise an ad seen only from the air.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-largest-coca-cola-logo,"In 2006, KFC launched a rebranding campaign, complete with a 65,000-foot-wide logo in the Mojave desert. Meant to be seen “from space,” it grabbed headlines and sparked concerns from environmentalists and modesty enthusiasts alike about a coming tide of “geobranding,” with companies etching their logos and billboards into the earth to complement newly common satellite mapping. But the KFC logo was quickly removed in 2007, and nary a copycat has since followed. Perhaps they all should have taken a note from Coca-Cola, which has had an equally obscure logo-for-satellites in the Chilean desert for almost 30 years. It still exists, and as if from a marketer’s nightmare, barely anyone knows about it. Created to commemorate Coke’s 100th anniversary, the logo is a simple one – that classic Coca-Cola script with a caption beneath it that originally read “100 años” - 100 years. This has been updated to “125 años” to accurately reflect the passage of time since the logo was built. The geo-sign is constructed out of 70,000 empty Coke bottles, bringing a whole “meta” angle to the dubious symbolism of branding the earth with consumer products. Even so, one can’t help but be impressed that Coke thought of this idea long before satellite images were commonplace, and certainly before they were readily accessible to the public at large. Perhaps they were going after the notoriously hard-to-crack airline pilots demographic, or maybe they did imagine a day in the future when anyone could gaze down upon the surface of the earth via satellite, from the comfort of their own home. The latter would explain the extraordinary longevity of this publicity stunt; but either way, it’s nice to look back (or down) on it now and see a quaint piece of marketing history, its longstanding nature making it an intriguing relic to be examined rather than a gaudy ploy to be dismissed. And if that was in fact their plan all along, then bravo, Coca-Cola. Bravo. Travel along Route 5, heading south from the city of Arica.

243,'Independent Republic' of Hualqui,"Hualqui, Chile","Despite being of the most short-lived republics in history, this small Chilean town won’t forget its two days of independence.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/independent-republic-of-hualqui,"This unassuming town of 22,000 inhabitants near Concepción, Chile, is still known locally as La República Independiente de Hualqui, or the Independent Republic of Hualqui. An otherwise typical central Chilean town, the “republic” boasts a 16th-century fortress and a surprising history. During the Chilean Wars of Independence (from 1810 to 1826), this tiny riverside settlement was right at the frontier of the Chilean territory. The people of Hualqui were caught in the crossfire as Chilean nationalists fought troops loyal to Spain for ultimate control. Eventually, Hualqui was abandoned by both combatants, and left vulnerable to famine and attack by the Mapuche tribe that controlled the land south of the river. For the war-weary and starving population of Hualqui, enough was enough. They duly declared their small municipality and its tiny fortress to be an independent republic in 1823 in the hope that they would be able to decide their own fate without state interference or invasion, and be left alone for once. Unfortunately for the newly free citizens of Hualqui, they were not left alone for long. A small detachment of troops from the city of Concepción, 20 miles downstream, violently quashed the rebellion two days after the declaration of independence. Thus, the fledgling Republic of Hualqui was reabsorbed into the only slightly less fledgling yet infinitely more sustainable Republic of Chile. Nevertheless, Hualqui has yet to forget its brief statehood, and still boasts its own flag, a “national” soccer team (Club Deportivo República Independiente de Hualqui), an online TV Channel (La República Independiente TV), an official magazine published by the local council (La República Independiente), and a “national” radio station (Radio República). The fort of 1577 still exists as a small park and viewpoint in the town, and can be visited free of charge.  By car, from Concepción, take the O-60 signposted Chiguayante, then follow signs for Hualqui. By public transport, the 18P bus from Concepción runs to Hualqui every 10 minutes and takes around an hour.

244,'The Presence of Latin America' Mural,"Concepción, Chile",The imposing piece of artwork is a celebration of Pan-American fraternity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-presence-of-latin-america-concepcion-chile,"Hidden in the cavernous foyer of a dour concrete building at the University of Concepción is a 115-foot mural from the 1960s depicting the turbulent history of Latin America and its peoples. The imposing piece of artwork was a gift from Mexico to the people of Chile. After an earthquake in 1960 destroyed large parts of the University of Concepión and much of the wider Concepión urban area, the government of Mexico agreed to aid the government of Chile in a display of international solidarity. It did so by financing a project to rebuild the Casa de Arte (Art House) at the university. After hearing about the project, the Mexican muralist Jorge González Camarena offered to create a mural celebrating Pan-American fraternity to decorate the interior of the otherwise plain but functional gift to one of Chile’s often overlooked provincial cities. The result is the impressive—if at times grim—mural, titled La Presencia de América Latina (The Presence of Latin America). The mural, which was designed to be viewed from left to right, reads as a history of Latin America. Starting with the pre-Columbian era, it flows through the fall of the Aztec and Inca Empires, the colonial era, and eventually ends with post-independence societies. The breathtaking frieze depicts corpses in armor and conquistadors. It portrays the people, fruits, and produce of Latin America being fed into the machines of industry. An image of a Copihue (the national plant of Chile) intertwined around a Mexican cactus acts as a symbol of international solidarity. The mural also shows the national symbols of Chile and Mexico (the condor and an eagle with a serpent) alongside the flags of modern Latin American states, a series of faces representing different races of people merging into one, a fusion of Central American and European architecture, and the Andes rising high in the background. Above the medley of images, visitors will see the words of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, “There is no beauty like the beauty of America spread out in its hells / in its mountains of rock and power, in its atavistic and eternal rivers.”  Members of the public are permitted to enter freely into the foyer to view the mural, which was declared a National Historical Monument in 2009. The mural is visible upon entering the Casa del Arte, located on the corner of Plaza Peru and Chacabuco, on the edge of the University of Concepción campus. Local buses 44E, 63F, and 90Y stop outside. It is about 10 minutes walk from the Plaza de la Independencia, Concepción's central square.

245,German Colonial Museum,"Frutillar, Chile",A sliver of 19th-century Germany sits on the shore of a Chilean lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/german-colonial-museum,"The story of the early German immigrants to Chile and their enchanting architecture is recounted at this immaculately landscaped museum, which preserves an assortment of 19th-century structures built by the colonists. Following revolutions in Europe in 1848, and encouraged by reconnaissance which claimed Lake Llanquihue to be “just like Lake Geneva” (but with more active volcanoes), 6,000 German families set sail for the far side of the globe to help build the democratic republic fate had denied them at home. These political exiles were encouraged by the Chilean Government to settle around the shores of this beautiful lake on the very edge of Patagonia. This museum dedicated to preserving the memory of the German colonists became possible after the land it stands on was donated to the Austral University of Chile in 1979. The meticulously preserved structures of the museum sit in an enviable elevated position, affording panoramic views across Lake Llanquihue toward the active volcanoes of the Andes. Principal exhibits include a wassermühle (watermill), which wouldn’t look out of place on a Bavarian meadow, a bauernhaus (farmhouse) from 1889 furnished with period German furniture, and an enormous circular barn exhibiting imported agricultural equipment brought by the settlers to revolutionize Chilean farming. A touching family cemetery also exists in the landscaped park, which is planted with native and imported species and criss-crossed by small streams, channels, and mill ponds. The two-story watermill was moved from the lakeside to its current location following the museum’s creation. This stunning addition houses a ground-floor exhibition telling the captivating story of these long-distance migrants and a gallery for local artists to display their work on the upper level.  After a visit to the museum, it is worth having a walk around the pretty town of Frutillar, which boasts many other German-style buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries. There are numerous cafes and restaurants here where you can sample hearty Chilean German fusion cooking, including the delicious Küchen Arandano (Blueberry Cake).",windmills immigration colonialism museums
246,Church of Guayacán,"Coquimbo, Chile",A charmingly unusual prefabricated metal church designed by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-of-guayacan,"When you arrive at the intersection of Rieles and Urmeneta in Coquimbo, Chile, you’ll be greeted by a structure that looks as it if it were an ornament bought at a craft market, fated to collect dust on a mantle-piece. The metal sides and rivets show their age but have otherwise withstood the test of time. The Church of Guayacán began its life in France. Its design is the work of none other than Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, who had designed metal churches that were made to be fabricated in Europe and then assembled on-site in the French colonies. The galvanized iron was expected to withstand whatever weather the tropics could throw at them. One of these prefab houses of worship found its way (after a side-trip to Belgium) to the town of Coquimbo, where it was erected in 1889. For a while, it served as a small Catholic hub, but then fell into disrepair and was eventually abandoned. Fortunately, the church was later restored in the 1960s and declared a national monument in 1977. The town of Coquimbo seems an unlikely spot to find such an unusual church, as it is not nearly as well-off as the neighboring city of La Serena (though the fish and produce market is well worth an extended visit).  The church is usually locked up, but even viewing its outside is a fascinating trip for anyone in the area.",catholic colonialism churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
247,Wulff Castle,"Viña del Mar, Chile",A whimsical European-style chateau that calls the coast of Chile home.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wulff-castle,"Gustav Wulff emigrated from Germany to Chile in 1881 and succeeded in building a fortune as a merchant. In the early 1900s, he acquired a piece of land in the growing resort community of Viña de Mar. By 1906, Wulff had constructed a home set in a dramatic location on a rocky, wave-battered promontory. Initially, the building was a somewhat ordinary home, designed with German and French influences and constructed mainly of wood. Later, Wulff began a long and eccentric collaboration with the architect Alberto Cruz Montt to transform the house into a castle. During the 1910s, Wulff and Montt replaced the wood with stone, expanded the floor plan with additional rooms, and embellished the entire structure with parapets, turrets, and crenellations worthy of a grand European manor. The most elaborate addition was the large round tower; built on an outcrop and connected to the main house by a bridge with a glass floor through which Wulff could watch the crashing waves. Architecturally, the Castillo Wulff has been described as “neo-Tudor,” “neo-Gothic,” and “neo-medieval”. Its mixture of revivalist styles makes it a great example of early 20th-century eclecticism. The castle’s unique appearance and prominent location have made it a landmark in Viña and iconic throughout Chile. After Wulff died in 1946, his heirs made further architectural additions and subtractions to the building before selling it to the city in 1960. The castle served as a naval museum from the 1960s to the 1980s, and then as a museum dedicated to the writer Salvador Reyes during the 1990s. In 1995, the castle was declared a national monument, precluding any further changes to the structure. Today, the castle houses the offices of the municipal heritage department, which manages the city’s historical and cultural sites and activities. It’s a fitting use for a building with so much history and culture of its own.",castles design history & culture architecture

However, silver is not the only item miners have dug up, as evinced by the city’s mineralogical museum. This museum was set up by the Univerisity of Atacama during the mid-19th century. Since then, it has survived earthquakes, fires, floods, and of course the passing of time and multiple moves. Nevertheless, the collection persevered, and its quality never diminished. Quite the opposite—the collection grew and expanded throughout its 150-year existence, becoming the largest collection of its kind in the country and one of the most complete in the world. Boasting over 2,000 samples, the collection is a wonderful walk through the world of mineralogy, all set up in fancy black cases. The collection is ordered by crystalline structure, grouping together minerals that share a structure. This gives the visitor a good idea of which minerals are similar, even if they look different based on color and size. The museum also has a section where it shows the raw and refined versions of various minerals, ranging from iron to copper.  The museum is open daily throughout the week from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Entrance is free.",rocks geology museums and collections museums

It was built in 1992, and that is very evident, since that is what cell phones looked like then. The giant phone, which appropriately is home to Movistar Communications, is surrounded by several parks, making for a very easy view of the building. Stretching 34 floors high, it is an architectural landmark in Santiago and was the tallest building in the country until 1999. For those tech-loving nerds, Fundación Telefonica houses a small “Paseo de las Telecomunicaciones” (Telecommunications Promenade) on the building, a collection of old phones, telegraphs and cellphones as a display on the evolution of communications and the history of the company. Take note that the surrounding area was deeply affected during the social unrest protests of 2019, so access to certain areas is limited.

The example in Concepción is one of only a handful of such beacons of Bismarck reverence built outside Europe by the German diaspora. Known locally as El Mirador Alemán (the German Viewpoint), the 30-foot-tall Bismarck Tower in Chile’s second city is the world’s most southerly example of this type of monument. Crowning the 850-foot-high Cerro Caracol (Snail Hill), and offering panoramic views, this patriotic podium was erected in 1921. The small but influential German-speaking community of Concepción intended to light a flaming beacon atop the tower on significant dates to commemorate the Prussian-born statesman. Bismarck’s crumbling likeness is carved onto a stone plaque halfway up the semi-ruinous structure. The stone tower was originally twice as high as it is today, but lost its upper tier during the devastating Chillán earthquake of 1949. It was damaged twice more in seismic calamities, in 1960 and 2010, which has led a German website dedicated to all things Bismarck Tower-related to nickname it the “Earthquake-proof Tower.” The Tower is at the summit of the Cerro Caracol Hill above the city, a scenic 1.5 mile hike or bike ride to an altitude of over 800 feet. The climb is not too difficult and is way-marked from the city's largest public park, Parque Ecuador, located on Calle Victor Lamas. Although Concepción is generally a safe city, it is not recommended to walk alone on the Cerro Caracol.",earthquakes towers politics monuments

The menu offers pork, chicken, and even pizza, all cooked in solar ovens in the courtyard that resemble satellite dishes. The staff places tea kettles in the center of the dishes, too. The satellite dishes, which can cook salmon in just a few minutes, are not the only solar ovens. Owners Jorge Armindo and Luísa Ogalde also have boxes with transparent tops that heat slowly, like cars parked under the summer sun, and slowly cook meat for around four hours, producing a tender texture. Cordillera Restobar Solar also boasts a solar-powered dehydrator to dry goat meat (ch’arki), which is used to prepare a traditional Andean stew called charquicán (made with potatoes and squash, usually served with an egg on top). Other dishes on their sunny menu are cazuela (made with lamb bones and jerk meat) and desserts such as a leche asada flan. “We cook dishes that are connected to our heritage culture here in the Atacama,”Armindo says. “From milk to meat, we use the whole animal.” The restaurant, with its wooden structure and thatched roof, resembles a beach bar. But it’s their unique cooking style that draws visitors from all over Chile, as well as foreign tourists. And their location on the southern edge of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth, but which also boasts some of the highest surface irradiance on the planet, ensures constant sun and makes solar cooking a year-round affair.  While some dishes cook quickly, patience is important, especially on cloudier days, as some orders require hours in a solar oven.",solar power cooking restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars food

It was made from local materials such as volcanic rocks extracted from a nearby quarry, and has cactus wood and palm tree roofing bound with mud and clay. This bell tower was built in a similar way. It has unique architecture and was also built with local material. The light material meant the structure could be built higher and more slender than other buildings. Both the tower and church were declared National Monuments and are currently maintained by the congregation of nuns from the order Jesus Verbo y Víctima.

254,Reloj de Flores (Flower Clock),"Viña del Mar, Chile","Built for the 1962 World Cup, this fully functioning botanical clock is still ticking.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/reloj-de-flores-flower-clock,"Soccer fans aren’t known for their love of flowers. Or clocks, for that matter, unless they’re counting down the seconds to a victory. But when Viña del Mar, Chile, was chosen as a venue for the 1962 World Cup, the coastal city nonetheless decided to spruce up its seafront with a large, flowery, fully functioning clock. The Reloj de Flores (Flower Clock) is a botanical landmark in Viña del Mar to this day. It has been severely damaged by both vandalism and a fallen tree over the years, but the flowers keep on blooming, and the clock’s still ticking. The original clock mechanism was built by the Favag clockmakers of the Swiss city of Neuchâtel, a world-famous center for clock and watchmaking. It was shipped over and installed on a sloping lawn at the foot of Cerro Castillo. The hour, minute, and second hands are between 8 and 10 feet long, gently tick-tocking along above a clock face made entirely of flowers. The flowers of the botanical dial are allowed to grow no higher than 4 inches (10 centimeters) to avoid impeding the path of the clock hands turning above them. Selected for their year-round blooms, the buds spell out the numbers on the clock face and create the inner and outer circles of the dial. But it hasn’t all been a bed of roses since 1962. The flower clock has suffered severe damage on two occasions, the first in September 2013 when vandals damaged the clock mechanism. Rather than try to repair the original Swiss clock, the city decided to replace it with a more modern and reliable timepiece controlled by GPS (it tells near-perfect time, so you can happily set your watch to it). Made by Relojes Olvera III Generación in Zacatlán, México, this new clock was also connected to a digital system that chimes every 15 minutes and, depending on the season or specific events, plays a variety of musical overtures. Less than four years later, however, the clock was all but obliterated when a tree fell on it during strong winds and torrential rain. It was a complete mess, and all that remained of the iconic clock were a few sadly bent and buckled clock hands. It only took 40 days, however, for the city to restore its famous flower clock. The reconstruction effort used more than 7,000 flowers and bushes, with each number on the clock face requiring more than 100 plants. And once the new clock mechanism and hands had arrived from Mexico, the timepiece was back to its flowery best. The clock is located along the seafront and is accessible 24 hours a day. Late afternoon is a good time to visit, when the setting sun casts a golden light over the hands and flowers. The clock is lit at night.",soccer flowers clocks plants

The crevice is deep enough for one or maybe two people crawl into and hide from the elements and light a fire while waiting for the ideal moment to go fishing. And it’s believed it was used for just that by the indigenous people of what is now Chile. Inside this crevice, archeologists found the remains of fish bones, shells, and other sea life pried open by human tools. On the roof, they discovered a drawing made with iron-rich paint. It’s an amazingly detailed drawing that depicts two humans in a canoe hunting what appears to be a whale. This painting is considered to be part of the El Médano style, which dates back to about 1,000 years ago. This style is typically associated with rock paintings that mostly depict scenes of people hunting sea life in canoes. This specific painting is special because of its accessibility, and because it’s about 125 miles north of other similar paintings.  The cave is relatively easy to access if you know the road. Drive past Michilla, and then on the left there will be a very hard to spot road at -22.68939, -70.27071 (just before a large rock formation and where the road curves to the left).

Given that all these locations are so close, it is no surprise that the town became so popular with tourists as a  sort of base camp. However, not all of the things that are close by are equally popular, some undeservingly so. The Yerbas Buenas petroglyphs are one such site that you won’t find on most destination guides. However, they are arguably one of the most interesting locations in the area, featuring hundreds of ancient pre-hispanic petroglyphs. The site is the focus of many archeological studies because it has served as a resetting place for herders, traders, and travelers for several centuries, with four distinct petroglyph styles being left by them. Many of the images at this site feature depictions of llamas or alpacas. You will find small llamas, big llamas, pregnant llamas and herds of llamas everywhere you look. It would be easy to play a game of “spot the next llama” while walking through the site. Besides llamas, there are some other drawings of flamingos, predatory animals, and even a monkey. This last one is quite a mystery to archeologists, as there are no monkeys in this part of South America, which suggests that people traveled very far even in those days. It is unknown why the drawings are there if they are made to pass time or to keep count of herds or even to prove a trade. Unfortunately, local guides will spice up what is known with stories of mysticism, tall tales, and even aliens. The truth, while perhaps less spectacular, is that we do not know.  You can easily get to the site by following the google maps directions. It's roughly a 50 kilometer drive on mostly good roads, good enough to traverse with any rental car.

It was built by the Norris Brothers in Philadelphia in 1850 and came to Chile the following year. The locomotive was in use for about seven years to transport goods and passengers. Every day, it traveled between Copiapó and Caldera. The train had two passenger cars, one for first class and one for second class. Oddly, the two cars were pretty much the same, except for the decorations that adorned the walls. The Copiapó was also comprised of a luggage car and some cargo cars. The Copiapó was originally a wood burning locomotive, a curious choice given Chile’s general lack of trees. Switching its fuel from wood to coal, coupled with the salinity of the area’s water, ultimately led to its demise. The locomotive still traveled quite a bit after it was retired from service. The Copiapó was moved to the National Museum of Chile in Santiago. In 1901, it went to the United States to be displayed at the Buffalo Pan American Exposition, and in 1929, it was used one last time to transport delegates of the South American Railway Congress. The locomotive finally returned to Copiapó in 1945, where it was placed on the grounds of the University of Atacama, where it still stands today.

However, perhaps the most interesting structure on the property is the Paranal Residencia used by employees. The building looks like it’s straight out of a sci-fi film, or maybe a James Bond film is more fitting. The Residencia was once used as a classic Bond villain hideout, and a pair of giant fake rocks not far from the property harkens back to its time on the big screen. These two innocuous looking rocks were once props for the James Bond movie Quantum of Solace. Certain segments of the movie were shot near the VLT site because of its remote location. In the film, the rocks were used as a prop for Bond and his companion to hide behind while slowly approaching the residencia, known as the Eco-hotel in the movie. Inside resided the film’s villain, Mr. Greene. While other large rocks were present at the location, the producers decided against using real boulders and had fake rocks flown in. These rocks looked so realistic that the European Southern Observatory held a competition to see who could spot the movie props from the real rocks.

These were more powerful than contemporary American models, as they had to traverse steep, curvy tracks at high altitudes.  The locomotives were mostly used to cart nitrate between the country’s “Nitrate Towns.” But as with many industrial things, the locomotives became obsolete and fell out of use. Most were scrapped or left in the desert to slowly rust away. Fortunately for the one in Taltal, it was spared and parked in a small square with two passenger trains and a little cargo train.

However, for a brief period of time every year, the river blossoms in a vibrant explosion of colors. During the short span between the wet and dry seasons, when the water level is just right, a unique species of plant that lines the river floor called Macarenia clavigera turns a brilliant red. It is offset by splotches of yellow and green sand, blue water, and a thousand shades in between. This only happens for a brief period between seasons. During Colombia’s wet season, the water flows too fast and deep, obscuring the bottom of the river and denying the Macarenia clavigera the sun that it needs to turn red. During the dry season, there is not enough water to support the dazzling array of life in the river. But for a few weeks from September through November, the river transforms into a veritable living rainbow. Caño Cristales is located in a remote, isolated area not easily accessible by road. Adventurous tourists can now fly into the nearby town of La Macarena. From there it is a short trip to “Serrania de la Macarena,” the national park in which Caño Cristales is located. The site was effectively closed to tourists for several years because of guerrilla activity in the region along with concerns about the impact of unregulated tourist traffic. It was reopened to visitors in 2009, and today there are several Colombian Tourist Agencies that will fly travelers to La Macarena.

Swimming is permitted only in designated areas. Swimmers mustn’t wear a sunscreen as to not destroy the fragile ecosystem. For perfect photographs, check the weather forecast, because when it’s cloudy, the sun rays do not illuminate the river so the colors are not that vivid.

263,Las Lajas Sanctuary,"Nariño, Colombia",A dangling church built over a Colombian gorge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/las-lajas-sanctuary,"Many places of worship are built around relics and icons. However, most of them are not built in such precarious and dangerous locations as Las Lajas Sanctuary, which crosses a forested gorge on the border between Colombia  and  Ecuador. In 1754, an Amerindian woman and her daughter found themselves caught in a brutal storm. Hiding out from the weather in the gorge, the women felt a force calling to them, and to their amazement looked up and saw the image of the Virgin Mary on the rocks above. At that moment, the woman’s daughter was simultaneously cured of her inability to hear and speak. Shortly after the discovery was reported, a blind man wandered for ten years from village to village collecting donations to build a chapel around the image. When he returned to Las Lajas, he was able to see again. Both of those 18th-century miracles inspired the creation of Las Lajas Sanctuary between 1916-1949, built around the original chapel. To co-opt the original miracle, the stone image on the cliff forms the back wall of the modern sanctuary, making a gorge-spanning bridge and church combination necessary. Although the site was dedicated a minor basilica by the Catholic Church in 1954, non-religious visitors can still enjoy the dramatic setting and neo-Gothic architecture. The massive church sits 150 feet high over the river below, and its turrets contrast elegantly with the green cliffs and cascading waterfall, which are visible from the arched stone bridge.  If you visit, you can ride a teleferico instead of walking up and down to the sanctuary.",bridges churches sacred spaces

Built in 1923 to serve as a successful architect’s lush mountain mansion, the decadent cliffside abode was constructed as a symbol of the lush roaring ’20s. During the 1950s the house was to be expanded to become an 18-story hotel complex, but the construction plans petered out leaving the French-styled architecture intact. After serving its time as the Hotel del Salto, the grand old house was abandoned and left to cultivate moss and tales of hauntings. Most recently the gorgeous building has been converted into the Tequendama Falls Museum, displaying wonders of the natural world to complement the organic beauty of the falls that inspired the building’s construction.",hotels abandoned museums
265,Guatapé,"Guatape, Colombia",The Andean town where every single building is decorated with a brightly colored frieze.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guatape,"In Guatapé, every building is a work of art. Residents paint their houses and businesses in gorgeous bright colors, and decorate the bottom of every building with fresco-like panels called “zocalos.” It’s sometimes called the most colorful town in the world. With its steep and windy streets and bright colors, Guatapé is ridiculously photogenic, but it’s the zocalos that make it distinctive. Some friezes are simply cute: Sunflowers, doves, and sheep are popular. Other zocalos advertise businesses: bread loaves on a bakery, sewing machines outside a clothing store. The most complicated tell stories—several panels showing a journey—or commemorate history: musical instruments marking the house of a famous local musician. The zocalo tradition seems to have started about a century ago—no one seems sure when or why—but it has accelerated in recent years. Today it’s rigorously maintained because it helps make Guatapé one of the most popular vacation towns in Colombia, and a favorite day trip from Medellín, the city two hours to the west. Guatapé is cheek-by-jowl two other Colombian wonders: It sits on the shore of a weird looking reservoir that twists and turns like a gerrymandered congressional district. And Guatapé is in the shadow of El Penol, one of the largest rocks in the world, climbable on an astonishing staircase.",reservoir color villages murals art

Covering a large area around the small town of Villavieja in the department of El Huila, the Tatacoa is home to one of the most important observatories on the continent. Its expansive land is not covered with dunes, as could be expected, but rather with rocky canyons that form dry labyrinths whose red and grey colors are interrupted by the occasional green bush. Its unique landscape is explained by the misnomer that characterizes it. The truth is, the Tatacoa Desert is not a desert at all, but a dry tropical forest. Millions of years ago, it was a lush forest full of vegetation and animals. Today, earth and rock stand where trees and flowers once stood, contrasting the ever-present Andes mountains that stand in the distance. The landscape is divided into two areas: Cuzco, tinted in a deep ochre; and Los Hoyos, colored in an ashy grey. Along the main road that cuts through it is one of the most important observatories in the country. Though small, the observatory boasts thousands of visitors throughout the year, and a team of knowledgeable astronomers who share their enthusiasm. Each night, it opens its doors to visitors, who go up to its roof and spend around two hours gazing at the sky and learning everything from the history of the names of constellations to how distance is measured. The highlight of the evening is, of course, getting to use the telescopes to feel closer to the stars. As the second largest arid area in Colombia, the Tatacoa is one of the most popular places for camping and geological excursions. Most people who head to the Tatacoa plan to walk into the loneliness of the canyons and find a place to set up camp. Isolated from the noise of other people, it is here that they do the best star-gazing. Perhaps the most incongruous sight in the ochre landscape is the aquamarine swimming pool set into the dry rolling landscape. Hostels run by the few families that inhabit the area also offer beds and hammocks for those who want to see the desert without venturing out into its maze. Regardless of their preference, most travelers end up at The Pool at some point. An unlikely oasis, this man-made pool is filled with natural water springing from the desert. Beer runs aplenty, and the coolness of the water is deliciously refreshing.  The easiest way to get into the desert is by bus. Head to Neiva, the capital of the El Huila department, and ask around the central bus station for routes heading to Villavieja. You'll get on a small vehicle that will charge $3-$5 to take you into town, but you can ask to be dropped off at the desert for a little extra.",dark skies stars swimming pools observatories martian landscapes deserts ecosystems

Approaching the Volcan de Lodo El Totumo (locally shortened to “El Totumo,” as “lodi” just means mud) it looks like a somewhat unremarkable, 50-foot pile of slippery earth. But climbing the stairs that lead to the summit  reveals a delightful oddity: a 15-foot diameter, lukewarm vat of grayish brown silt the consistency of a thick cream soup. Any bathers in the pool look like they’ve been dipped in chocolate. According to the local lore, El Totumo used to erupt with molten lava until a cunning local priest, who saw the bursts of flame as the Devil’s work, poured Holy Water into the fiery mouth and turned it into volcano of mud. Nowadays tourists can ascend a rickety wooden staircase and safely plunge into the muck, which contains minerals such as aluminum, calcium, and magnesium. Locals insist that the therapeutic baths bring numerous health benefits, but at very least you’ll get a pore cleansing and some especially smooth skin. The adventure only concludes, however, after (precariously) sliding down the exit stairwell into an idyllic lagoon to wash off. There, local village women will quite literally snatch off your bathing suit and use it to scrub the mud and dead skin clean off your baby-soft epidermis.

They’re reflected within brine pools that double as mirrors, creating the dazzling illusion of a never-ending rainbow loop that beckons explorers deeper into the network of tunnels. The mine at Nemocón offers a fantastic look into the area’s salty past. It’s the second-largest salt mine in Colombia, beaten only by the magnificent nearby Salt Cathedral. Different chambers within the mine highlight various facets of the region’s lucrative salt mining history, transforming the subterranean site into an unusual, experiential museum. There’s even a small church inside that holds weekly mass on Sundays and an enormous “heart of the Virgin” constructed from salt. Between 1819 and 1968, generations of workers extracted roughly 8 million tons of salt from the mine. But even before then, locals have long been taking advantage of the wealth of minerals buried just below the mountainous surface. Archaeologists discovered ceramics dating back to the fourth century BC that show Nemocón was already a booming hotspot for salt extraction. Centuries later, the Muisca people—named the “Salt People,” for obvious reasons—brought the industry to new heights. As a result of their mines, Nemocón flourished as a high-altitude market town and salt trading hub.",wonders of salt salt subterranean underground mines tunnels subterranean sites churches sacred spaces museums

By the 1900s, the massive 10-million-ton rock was seen by local farmers as a nuisance, a giant version of the rocks that the farmers regularly dug out of their fields. In 1954 a group of friends — supposedly at the urging of a local priest — climbed the rock using a series of boards wedged into a crack. These were the first people known to have climbed El Peñon de Guatape. (It is unknown whether the Tahamies had a way of ascending the stone.) Climbing the huge stone took five days, but the top of the rock revealed beautiful views and a new species of plant, Pitcairma heterophila. The rock soon became a modest tourist attraction. The rock, which is almost entirely smooth, has one long crack, the one that the climbers used in ascending it. In the crack was later wedged a 649-step masonry staircase, the only way to get to the top of the Piedra de Penol. In the 1970s, the area was dammed, and the view from the rock changed: It now overlooks a dramatic series of lakes and islands. Today, you can ascend the rock (apparently owned by a local family, though also designated by Colombia as a “national monument”) for $6 USD. There you’ll find a few religious relics and a three-story lookout tower.  Sotrasanvicente bus company has regular services to Piedra del Peñol.

272,Ciudad Perdida,"Santa Marta, Colombia",An ancient city hidden in the heart of the Sierra Nevada mountains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ciudad-perdida,"At the end of more than 1,200 mountainside steps in the near-impenetrable tropical forest of Colombia’s Sierra Nevada lie the ruins of an ancient, abandoned city. Uncovered in the 1970s, the incredible city was one of the important archaeological discoveries of the 20th century, revealed to the world as Ciudad Perdida, or the “Lost City.” Perhaps most remarkable about Ciudad Perdida is the fact that it was built some 650 years before Machu Picchu in Peru, around the year 800. The city was also massive by ancient standards—believed to be home to some 2,000 to 8,000 inhabitants—and an impressive feat of engineering, built along a steep mountain ridge nearly a mile above sea level. A complex network of stone bridges and drainage systems has maintained the city throughout the test of time. The site is believed to have been the seat of power of the Tairona civilization, which spanned throughout the Sierra Nevada and the northern region of Colombia. It was likely abandoned in the 16th century, amid the arrival of conquistadores from Spain. European colonial powers justified their conquests by asserting that they had a legal and religious obligation to the land. Yet despite the name it has been given, the “Lost City” was never really lost to the descendants of the Tairona people that still occupy the region. Today they are known as the Wiwa, Kogi, Arhuaco, and Kankuamo peoples. Though their ancestors abandoned the city centuries ago, the Indigenous people of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta never forgot about it. When the site was “discovered” in the ’70s, Indigenous leaders quietly asserted that they knew of the city’s existence all along. In fact, they had never stopped visiting the site, which they call “Teyuna.” They had simply been careful to keep its location a secret from outsiders in order to avoid precisely what happened after looters found the city. The site is now open to visitors after being closed off for years—though only the most dedicated (and physically capable) of adventurers can visit. The site is only accessible by a 27-mile hike through treacherous terrain and an inhospitable climate.",lost cities discovery hiking indigenous mountains ancient abandoned
273,Jaime Duque Park,"Tocancipá, Colombia",A little known Colombian theme park of giant curiosities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jaime-duque-park,"In a small Colombian town 30 minutes outside of Bogotá lies a giant, full-scale replica of the Taj Mahal, finished with four towering spires and a white bulb at the top. Virtually unknown to all tourists, this replica is part of Jaime Duque Park, a locally renowned agglomeration of history and culture of epic proportions. In 1983, chief pilot of Avianca Airlines Jaime Duque Grisales decided to dedicate his life to philanthropy by creating an atmosphere of education and family fun for the children of Colombia. To do so, Grisales constructed Jaime Duque Park, a 70-acre family-themed amusement park near the town of Briceno. One of Grisales’ aims was to bring the entire world to Colombia, and just that he did. In addition to the Taj Mahal, Jaime Duque Park features each of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World, including replicas of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Moscow’s Red Square, and the Egyptian Pyramids. Along with its extraordinary worldly sights, the park also offers concerts, a zoo, a conservation area, a palace of mirrors, a playground of climbable, multi-story dinosaurs, and a 1:25000 scale topographical map of Colombia. (Not to be confused with this other scale topographical map of Colombia.) The idea is to impart historical and geographical knowledge, with all proceeds going to charitable causes. Grisales connected the different attractions in the park via a series of bridges, colorfully painted outdoor walkways, and monorail-mounted bikes. The park is surrounded by a wacky, multicolored castle. Another curiosity is the monument of a human hand hoisting up a sphere, dubbed “The Hand of God.” Also found in Jaime Duque Park are battleships, stone statues, and two museums: the “Outfits of the World” fashion museum and the “Museum of Mankind in the Universe,” featuring a collection of statues explaining important moments in human evolution.",theme parks
274,Cathedral of Salt,"Zipaquira, Colombia","Cathedral carved out of salt, located a mile below the earth's surface.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-of-salt-of-zipaquira,"The story of the Cathedral of Salt of Zipaquira is certainly one of persistence. The original cathedral was carved out of an active salt mine beginning in 1950. Inaugurated in 1954, the cathedral only lasted for 36 years before authorities, worried about its structural soundness, shut it down. This, however, did not deter the town of Zipaquira. In 1991, only a year after shuttering the old cathedral, work began on a new salt church some 200 feet below the old one. The current salt cathedral is roughly 75 meters long and 25 meters high, with a giant cross carved into the back wall. It can theoretically accommodate 10,000 people. Smaller naves dug out around the main chamber illustrate the life of Christ from birth to crucifixion. These naves are known as “The Stations of the Cross.” They chronicle Jesus’ last journey. The walk takes you on the journey in chronological order. Each station has a different cross carved out of rock salt and kneeling platforms. Essentially, each station is a small chapel. While clearly devoted to Catholicism, the salt “cathedral” is not in fact recognized by the Church and has no official status. This doesn’t stop the 3,000-plus visitors that come to the cathedral on most Sundays from praising the glory of both God and his mineral-ensconced home.  It takes about two to three hours to tour the cathedral. It costs about $16 to enter, and the on-site museum is not included. You need a separate ticket for the museum.

Meanwhile the four hippos Escobar imported have thrived and, in one case, escaped the confines of the estate. In 2009, a hippo named Pepe was found 100 kilometers away and was killed by the Colombian military. The group of wild hippopotamuses is now estimated at around 40.

276,The Palace of the Inquisition,"Cartagena, Colombia",This elegant Colombian fortress was one of the torture headquarters for the Spanish Inquisition.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-palace-of-the-inquisition-cartagena-colombia,"The Parque de Bolivar located in the historic El Centro neighbourhood of Cartagena, is one of the ancient city’s most popular relaxation spots. Here in the leafy shade offered by the palm trees, and surrounded by cooling water fountains and tropical birds, Cartageneros meet to waste away the afternoon, playing chess and sipping coffee from the street vending tintos. It’s also home to some of the city’s most beautiful examples of Spanish Colonial architecture, one of the prettiest examples of which takes up the southern side of the square. Built in 1770, it features a grandiose entrance built in the Baroque style, long wooden balconies covered with pink bougainvillea, and an ornate cast iron fence. The stone entrance gives way to a lush courtyard filled with palm trees, detailed tile work and bright yellow plaster walls. But this 18th century palatial mansion hides a dark secret, a clue to which is to be found on the side wall around the corner to the main entrance; a small window with a simple crucifix above it bears the legend, “Ventana de la Denuncia.” Here in this tranquil setting, heretics would be denounced and led inside to meet their fate. For this beautiful building was the torture palace of the Spanish Inquisition. Under the innocent sounding name of the Court of the Holy Office, the Spanish Inquisition carried out its gruesome work until independence from Spain was won in 1812. Walking into the courtyard, the first building encountered was the secret prison called the House of Dungeons. Here, denounced heretics would await their judgement. Torture was used not as a punishment itself for heresy but to obtain a confession which the Inquisitors believed was necessary to bring the heretic back to faith. The Inquisition’s principal purpose was to defend and protect deemed threats to the Catholic Church, including blasphemy, witchcraft, and heresy. Once a confession was signed, the victim was sentenced to death in a public auto-da-fé in the courtyard outside. Today the palace is open as a museum, wherein many of the grisly tools used to extract confessions are on display. The principal method of torture was the strappado, where the victim was tied with their hands behind their back and suspended in the air whilst a series of weights and drops were added. The other infamous torture method was the rack. Often just watching another victim being stretched on the rack was all it took to obtain a confession. The museum also features other such disturbing relics as thumb screws, the head crusher, and an iron collar covered in lethal spikes. One of the largest groups targeted by the Inquisition in Cartagena were supposed witches. However the persecution of witches amounted to little more than the vilification of women through trials where victory for the accused was impossible. A notice on the wall of the museum lists the questions the accused faced, amongst them, “What evils have you caused and to whom?”; “What words do you pronounce when you fly?”; and “Why does the devil cause you blows at night?” In the over 800 trials which took place at the Palacio de la Inquisición, not a single person was ever found innocent. Walking through the museum, past the infamous witches’ ducking stool, and into the leafy courtyard beyond, you can see the Inquisitor’s guillotine still standing. Whilst the last official victim put to death by the Inquisition was in 1834, the organization actually still exists today as part of the Catholic Church. Ready to root out heretics, it is known as the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. A visit to the museum in Cartagena is a darkly disturbing one. The square outside, with its statue of Simon Bolivar, the leader of Colombia’s independence from Spain, and the building itself, are some of the ancient city’s most beautiful spots, but inside, dark artifacts from a disturbing chapter in the history of Cartagena await.",torture museums palaces

As it expanded rapidly in the late 20th century, informal neighborhoods—usually unauthorized, unplanned, and unserved by city government—climbed up the slopes of the Medellín River valley. The mostly poor people in neighborhoods like Santo Domingo and Popular faced daunting commutes to jobs downtown, not least because roads were too narrow and steep for decent bus service. In 2004 the city pioneered a new kind of mass transit, a fast-moving urban gondola system called Metrocable that carries commuters from the hills directly to the light-rail station at the valley floor. The Metrocables—as of 2018 there are three of them, with more planned—have proved both wildly useful and popular, as well as extremely scenic. The cars, which each hold eight passengers, speed up the hills on an elevated cable at 10 miles an hour. They are not much different from a gondola that might take you up to the top of an Alp. But what’s different are the setting and the passengers. Stations are dropped right in the bustle of jam-packed city neighborhoods. Line K, the city’s first and most popular line, has 30,000 riders each day, and cuts commute times in half or more. They’ve also become popular with tourists, since they offer amazing views of the city. The Metrocables are wonderful, but they’re also strange. They make incessant noise, so people who live and work under them have to learn to block out the racket. The cars also offer excellent views into house and apartment windows, enabling urban spying.  The city has three cable lines, K, J, and L. Line K starts at the Acevedo rail station and climbs up more than a mile, and four stations, to Santo Domingo.

The tiny snack shop/restaurant barely sits 20 people, but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in home-cooking and a palpable sense of history. The shop is located in an old colonial home a block from Bogota’s Plaza de Bolivar. Walk in and you’ll see a wooden bar to the right, with space enough to seat 10 people. Follow a small staircase to the upper level and you’ll find three or four tables where loyal customers—including politicians, artists, and scientists—have tucked into tamales and bowls of ajiaco soup (made of chicken and potatoes) since the place opened in 1816. The name of the restaurant translates to “The False Door.” When it first opened, La Puerta Falsa had no name, it was just a hole in the wall for hungry passersby. But across the street from the snack shop was a false door set into the side of the Catedral Primada. This door served to confuse any would-be assailants in times of war or turmoil, and was a notable feature in the street. So locals began to refer to the increasingly popular eatery as “the place near the false door,” which in time simply became La Puerta Falsa.  Today, La Puerta Falsa is well loved as one of the oldest and most traditional restaurants in Bogota, and it steadfastly hangs on to its traditional values. It's not flash, the menu is limited, service can be slow, and you won't find tacky souvenirs or other tourist trappings on display. As for the menu, La Puerta Falsa is best known for its ajiaco soup and its tamales, which are often ranked among the best in the city. It also sells traditional sweets and chocolate completo, a traditional Colombian hot chocolate with cheese, buttered bread, and a biscuit.

Colombian architect Octavio Mendoza sculpted the 5,400-square-foot abode entirely from clay, using no other materials to support the two-story structure. He then let it bake and harden in the sun, which transformed the pliable clay into solid, sturdy ceramic. He refers to the home as the biggest piece of pottery in the world. The shape of the house also reflects Mendoza’s natural approach to architecture. The walls slope and curve much like how the surrounding hills roll toward the horizon. The inside is airy and welcoming, with colorful tile mosaics adding vibrant pops of color to the baked, earthy walls. Downstairs there are several rooms, a full working kitchen, and a dining room.  Several bedrooms and bathrooms, one of which is hidden and holds a raised bed perfect for kids.

282,Convento de la Popa,"Cartagena, Colombia","Perched atop the highest hill in Cartagena, this 17th-century convent offers spectacular views of the city.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/convento-de-la-popa,"Explore this convent, and you’ll feel as though you’re on top of the world. Or, at least on top of Cartagena. The white-washed, red-roofed complex crowns the highest hill in the city, offering stunning vistas of the buildings stretching toward the Caribbean Sea. The convent’s history is as intriguing—and at times troubling—as its views are beautiful. The original structures were built in the early 1600s by Augustinian friars. Supposedly, the Virgin Mary came to Friar Alonso de la Cruz Paredes in a dream and instructed him to build the convent atop the hill looming over Cartagena. According to legend, some locals had previously worshipped an evil spirit in the shape of a goat that lived atop the hill the abbey would soon dominate. By building the convent, the friar was able to fulfill his mission of bringing Christianity to the land the Spanish had colonized. From its early days, the convent was plagued with turbulent times. Though its perch high atop the city helped protect it somewhat from pirate attacks and other invasions, the cloister was still damaged a number of times throughout the centuries. A lot of the convent’s historical records were lost during these attacks. During the early 19th century, the Augustinian friars were forced to abandon the abbey in the years after the Colombian Declaration of Independence. They didn’t regain control of the cloister until 1961. Now, the convent is open for anyone to explore and houses a small religion museum. Visitors can walk around the complex, find respite in the sunny, plant-filled central square, and drink in the views of Cartagena’s skyline. It's best to take a cab to the convent, as the road leading to the top of the hill is long and steep.",christianity colonialism religion sacred spaces museums history
283,Museo del Oro,"Bogotá, Colombia",This Bogotá museum houses the world's largest collection of pre-Columbian gold relics.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-del-oro-2,"When it comes to gold, few museums on earth can rival the Museo del Oro in Bogotá. Its spectacular collection of more than 34,000 pre-Columbian gold artifacts is the largest in the world, with relics from the various cultures that inhabited Colombia before the Old World collided with the New. Since the 1930s, Colombia’s Bank of the Republic has been helping to preserve, catalog, and exhibit some of the country’s most treasured historical artifacts. Among these is a vast collection of gold, housed in the Museo del Oro in Bogotá. The museum’s collection of 34,000 pre-Columbian gold artifacts is the largest on earth and includes pieces from Colombia’s various indigenous populations, including the Calima, Muisca, Quimbaya, San Agustín, Zenú, Tierradentro, Tolima, Tairona and Urabá cultures. Among these many pieces are two particularly special items: the Poporo Quimbaya and the Balsa Muisca. Many poporos–devices used to carry lime for the chewing of sacred coca leaves–have been found in archaeological digs in Colombia, but none are as famous as the Poporo Quimbaya. Dating back to around 300 AD, the poporo is made from tumbaga, an alloy of gold and copper, and would have been used during the ritual chewing of coca leaves in religious ceremonies. The Poporo Quimbaya has become a national symbol and has been represented on Colombia’s currency. Perhaps even more famous is the Balsa Muisca, or Muisca Raft, discovered in a cave outside Bogotá and now taking pride of place in the Museo del Oro. This artifact is directly connected to the legend of El Dorado, sometimes thought to refer to a city but actually recalling the mythical Hombre Dorado (The Golden Man), a mythical tribal chief, or zipa, of the Muisca civilization. The Muisca Raft is a miniature model of this Golden Man as he stands on a raft surrounded by his chiefs prior to his initiation ceremony, in which he is covered in gold dust before being submerged in Lake Guatavita.  The Museo del Oro is divided into various rooms highlighting different periods and processes including the Offering Boat Room where you'll find the Muisca Raft. Apart from the huge collection of gold, you'll also find many pre-Columbian artifacts made of pottery, stone, shell, wood and textiles. Nearly all exhibits have bilingual (Spanish and English) descriptions. The museum is located at Carrera 6 No. 15-82, Bogotá. Opening hours are from Tuesday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sundays from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. (closed Mondays). The entrance fee is COP$4000 (about $1.35).",
284,Parque de las Luces,"Medellín, Colombia",Three hundred illuminated pillars form an “artificial forest” in Medellín.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/parque-de-las-luces,"The Parque de las Luces is a public park in what was once a rather dangerous part of Medellín. Today, 300 illuminated pillars stand in the space, providing shade by day and light by night. The area now occupied by Parque de las Luces, also known as Plaza Cisneros, was once the main marketplace in Medellín. It was here that farmers and traders gathered to sell their wares, and where the train came in from the countryside, laden with goods to unload at the train station just across from the market. In the 1960s, however, Colombia’s railroad system went bust, and in the 1990s the market was moved to a more efficient location. Plaza Cisneros, as it was then most commonly known, fell into a period of decline, and soon became a seedy spot frequented by thieves, drug addicts, and prostitutes. Later, as part of a major project to renovate the center of Medellín, a plan was launched to redevelop Plaza Cisneros. The old market square was totally demolished, and in 2005 an altogether different kind of square was inaugurated. It still went by its official name of Plaza Cisneros, but was soon more commonly known as Parque de las Luces, or the Park of Lights. The name refers to the 300 pillars that rise up from the square, the tallest reaching a height of 78 feet (24 meters). Made of concrete and metal, each column contains an illuminated strip, creating an “artificial forest” that provides shade during the day and light at night. Water fountains, floor lighting, and bamboo complete the picture, creating a modern space surrounded by a handful of important buildings, including the EPM Library, the Carre and Vásquez Buildings, and the renovated Antioquia Railway Station. The park functions as a meeting point and as a place to relax, while also hosting street performances and events such as the 2018 Medellín Marathon. It’s also a popular spot for photographers, who come to make the most of the strange sci-fi like atmosphere created by the 300 pillars.  Parque de las Luces is located right in the middle of Medellín, between Avenida Amador and Calle 44. You can get there by taking the metro to either the San Antonio station on Line A or the Cisneros metro station on Line B, after which you’ll need to walk three or four blocks to the park. While much safer than before, the area can still be dangerous late at night. If you want to see the lights at night, it’s best to take a taxi, go with a group, and don’t stay too late.",public art forests parks ecosystems art
285,Windows of Tisquizoque,"Florián, Colombia",A three-tiered waterfall plummets from a mountain cave with amazing views over the countryside.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/windows-of-tisquizoque,"At this waterfall, a river erupts from the mouth of a cave high up on a mountain. The water hurtles toward the ground in a flurry of bubbles and mist in an awe-worthy, powerful spectacle. Visiting this amazing place feels like going into a Jurassic Park movie. This hidden gem of Colombia lies in the eastern Andes and has remained largely off the typical tourist track. Strangely, someone erected a giant Godzilla-like creature to guard the entrance, adding an artistic human touch to this otherwise natural wonder. The cave, which is aptly named, acts like a window. Those who make the uphill hike to explore within are rewarded with spectacular views over the countryside. The cave also serves as a window into the area’s geologic past, letting visitors witness the power of a river determined to overcome any obstacle that may stand in its way. The river that forms the waterfall winds through a deep canyon that eventually comes to a halt. A combination of erosion and the underlying geology allowed the river to carve its way through the mountain wall, forming a cave that stretches for about 650 feet. The river then pours out of the cave’s opening, resulting in a three-tiered waterfall that roars thunderously as it the water plummets through the air. The name of the place comes from the chief (cacique) who ruled this land when the Spaniards invaded. Legend has it that he jumped to his death after defying the Spanish, who sought to enslave his people. The best way to live the adventure and really enjoy the journey is by mountain bike. Bike Colombia does tours which start from Bogotá by car and the from Chiquinquirá by bike. The area has also become a climbing destination after the owners of Bike Colombia told some fellow climbers about the place.",waterfalls rivers mountains caves ecosystems water geology
286,Lake of Guatavita,"Sesquilé, Colombia","Known as the site of 'El Dorado,' this mysterious lake is rumored to hold gold beneath its waters.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-of-guatavita,"Lake of Guatavita, also known as Laguna de Guatavita, is a beautiful natural reserve located just two hours outside of Bogotá. After climbing 150 steps up to its crater-like edge, travelers can soak in views of the lush surrounding countryside of Cundinamarca and nearly perfect circular lagoon below. The verdant lake was also once a sacred ritual site of the Muisca civilization (the original indigenous peoples of Central Colombia), which eventually led to the rumored myth of El Dorado. Here’s how the story goes: the Muisca Chief (later referred to as the zipa by Spanish conquistadors) would anoint himself with oils and gold dust and set sail to the center of the lake on a ceremonial raft. There, he would throw offerings of jewels into the lake —including emeralds, gold, metalwork, and other sacred trinkets—before plunging himself into the water. The ritual reportedly marked the transition between Muisca chiefs, as well as showed reverence to the gods; the precious offerings were not used for material wealth but seen as religious or spiritual offerings for worship. By the 16th century, however, Spanish colonizers got word of the ritual and the mystical Lake Guatavita and began the now-infamous quest for El Dorado. Translated from Spanish, El Dorado literally means “the golden one” (referring to the gold-adorned chief and his raft), but over time the legend was exaggerated to also include a city or even an empire made of solid gold. Armed with greed and an insatiable dream of wealth, Spanish conquistadors searched all over Latin America for the rumored mythical land. The Spanish colonizers attempted to drain Lake Guatavita several times in search of treasure, but their efforts were all unsuccessful. Although jewelry and artifacts were recovered from the lake, the rumors of a plentiful golden bounty hidden beneath the waters of the tree-lined, crater lake proved to be false. It wasn’t until over 300 years later that the quest for El Dorado finally began to exhaust itself and was ultimately dismissed as only a myth. Today, Lake of Guatavita is located roughly 30 minutes from the town of “The New Guatavita.” The original town, which was once the capital of the Muisca people, was destroyed after it was flooded during the construction of the reservoir Embalse de Tominé. Built in the 1960s for the town’s displaced inhabitants, New Guatavita was recreated in the Spanish colonial style with rustic stucco buildings.  The small town is now home to just under 7,000 residents, and visitors can enjoy artisan and souvenir shops, as well as the Museo Guatavita.  Before heading out to the lake, check out the Museum of Gold in Bogotá, which offers a detailed history of the lake and the quest for El Dorado, as well as 55,000 pieces of gold and the ceremonial Muisca Raft.",

288,Bogotá Botanical Garden,"Bogotá, Colombia",Colombia's biggest botanical garden contains plants from all across the country.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bogota-botanical-garden,"The Bogotá Botanical Garden is home to plants from across Colombia’s various ecosystems, with a particular focus on Andean and páramo species. You’ll also come across iconic Colombian flora, including the national flower and tree. The Jardín Botánico de Bogotá José Celestino Mutis, to give it its official name, was founded by the Colombian botanist and priest Dr. Enrique Pérez Arbeláez in 1955. Arbeláez, along with his assistant Teresa Arango Bueno, had worked long and hard to open a botanical garden in Bogotá, a dream finally realized when the city agreed to loan them more than 40 acres of land for the project. Arbeláez named the botanical garden after the Spanish botanist, mathematician and priest José Celestino Mutis. Mutis had led the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada, a botanical expedition to South America that lasted from 1783 and 1816. With the land secured and the name decided, Arbeláez and his assistant then undertook lengthy expeditions throughout Colombia, collecting seeds for the new botanical garden. They had a particular interest in Andean flora, an interest reflected in the botanical garden today. Among the various themed sections of the garden are five Special Collections for Conservation (CEPAC) areas dedicated to endangered Andean plants, including páramo species (Andean woodland plants). You’ll also come across areas dedicated to cacti, palms, medicinal plants, aquatics, orchids and more, and large greenhouses climatized at different temperatures to recreate the conditions of different regions of Colombia. In total, there are about 19,000 plants at the Bogotá Botanical Garden, representing the range of ecosystems found across the country. Among them you’ll find Colombia’s most emblematic plant species. There’s the wax palm tree, an Andean palm recognized as the national tree of Colombia. And among the many orchids at the botanical garden is Cattleya trianae, Colombia’s national flower. As well as protecting various endangered species, the Bogotá Botanical Garden is heavily involved in research, whether it be sustainability, biotechnology or environmental education. So as well as being a fine place for a stroll, the botanical garden is also an important academic center with connections to many universities in Bogotá and beyond. Update March 2019: As of March 2019, a big section of the park is closed because of renovations/construction of six large greenhouses.  The Bogotá Botanical Garden is located at Avenida Calle 63 n. 68-95, Bogotá. It’s not far from the huge Simón Bolívar Metropolitan Park, so you can combine a visit to both for a day of fresh air in the middle of the city. The botanical garden is open Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the weekend. It’s closed the first Monday of every month. The entrance fee is 3,500 Colombian pesos (about $1.15 US). You can explore the park independently or go with a guide.

289,Central Cemetery of Bogotá,"Bogotá, Colombia",Storied crypts fill the most famous cemetery in Colombia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-cemetery-of-bogota,"The Cementerio Central in Bogotá was opened in 1836, shortly after Colombia’s break from Spain. Since then, it has been the final resting place for presidents, poets, and nameless civilians alike. The sprawling avenues and streets of the cemetery are crowded with elaborate mausoleums spanning the country’s history. Although heads of state have been interred here since Colombia’s beginning, two of the most visited graves are those of children and a beermaker. Offerings of sweets and white flowers crowd the grave of the young Bodmer sisters, who died of a strange disease in 1903. Legend has it that the children’s mother visited the cemetery and asked that her youngest child - a son that was also afflicted - would be spared. He was. Since then the sisters have been celebrated as angels and healers, visited to this day by people praying for the health of children. Another popular grave is that of Leo Siegfried Kopp, an entrepreneur who emigrated from Germany to found Bavaria - which became one of the biggest breweries in the world. Known for his financial success, generous philanthropy, and care for his employees, he has continued to be celebrated and even worshipped since his death in 1927. The businessman’s grave is topped with a replica of Rodin’s Thinker and believers come to whisper their secrets, hopes, and dreams in the statue’s golden ear.

These men aren’t even men at all—they’re trees draped in breathtaking curtains of moss. El Gallineral Park, situated near the Fonce River, is home to a grove of nearly 2,000 beloved trees planted over 300 years ago. But the trees’ age isn’t what makes them so mesmerizing. Many of the towering plants were intentionally covered in Spanish moss, known locally as barbas de viejo (old man’s beard), to make them look like wise old men. The “wise old men” are indeed a majestic sight. Spools of moss dangle from their branches, reaching toward the ground like a wizard’s silver beard. Sunlight filters through the tendrils, giving the plants an otherworldly glow. Exploring the 10-acre park reveals a wealth of walkways that let you wander among the trees. The paths wind through the forest, connecting the various squares, allowing you to leave the bustle of the nearby city far behind. Two artificial, chlorinated pools within the park are the perfect place to cool off on a hot, sticky day.  Street level parking is available next to the park in front of the Fonce river malecón.

291,Comuna 13,"Medellín, Colombia",Outdoor escalators and art have helped change what was once a notoriously dangerous part of Medellín.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/comuna-13,"Comuna 13 used to be one of the most dangerous areas in Medellin but community projects and a series of outdoor escalators have helped turn this poor district into one of the most colorful communes in the city. Throughout the 80s and 90s, Comuna 13 was considered one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. It was run by violent drug trafficking organizations, who used the poor, sprawling hillside barrio as a transit route in and out of the city, and served as a stronghold for guerrillas, gangs, and paramilitaries. But things began to change in 2002 when President Alvaro Uribe launched Operation Orion, a raid on Comuna 13 spearheaded by 3,000 troops backed by helicopters. It was a brutal and controversial beginning. During the first week of the raid, at least 18 people were killed, 34 wounded and almost 250 arrested in Comuna 13. The neighborhood’s 100,000 residents were caught in the crossfire, resulting in arbitrary detentions, disappearances, and hundreds of injuries. During the following decade, the government set about improving the hillside commune, redeveloping the brick houses and building community centers but access remained a problem. So, in 2011, the government installed the escaleras electricas, a series of outdoor escalators that extend for 1,260 feet (384 m), connecting parts of the once chaotic and isolated hillside neighborhood to the city below. The escalators gave residents newfound freedom and brought about a total shift in the local mentality. Kids began to play on the streets once again, and local artists felt safe enough to go out and brighten up their neighborhood. The result was the creation of one of the most colorful communes in Medellín. The area surrounding the six sets of escalators is now covered with murals and graffiti, with bright colors and street art decorating walls once riddled with bullet holes. Many murals tell the story of Comuna 13, or depict local heroes, the artwork sliding by as you ride the escalator up to the top of the hill, where a lookout and boardwalk provide excellent views across the city. It’s been a dramatic shift for Comuna 13, and tourists now come to ride the escalator and see the street art. But despite the improvements, it remains a poor and not entirely safe neighborhood. Comuna 13 still has a long way to go, but at least the future looks far brighter for what was once one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world.  Comuna 13 (San Javier) is located in Zone 4 of Medellín, along the western fringes of the city. To get to the commune, take the metro to San Javier metro station. From there, it’s a 15 to 20 minute walk to the foot of the escalators, or you can take a bus (221i or 225i). While you can visit Comuna 13 independently, it’s best to go with a local guide. The area still suffers from poverty and violence, so having a knowledgeable local with you will make the trip safer and more interesting. Comuna 13 tours aren’t part of the “dark tourism”/""narco tourism” thing that you’ll find in other parts of Medellín, or at least they shouldn’t be. Do your research before choosing a local tour operator or guide, and pick one that has genuine connections with the community. If you do go independently, go during the day and stick to the area immediately surrounding the escalators.",
292,Door Knockers of Cartagena,"Cartagena, Colombia",The colonial city's social history is reflected in its fanciful door knockers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/door-knockers-or-cartagena,"Cartagena’s historic Old Town is like an open-air museum. The colorful streets are strewn with impressive colonial architecture, and defensive walls and fortifications rise up around the historic center. And then there are the smaller, but just as telling, details, such as the large and fanciful door knockers that adorn many of the old wooden doors. Cartagena was founded in 1533, and within years became a strategically key port city for the Spanish empire. Spain’s influence on the architecture of the walled city is clear to see, although immigrants from France, Italy, and North Africa also had a role in shaping Cartagena’s distinct and undeniably attractive style. The door knockers, however, were very much a Spanish colonial thing. During the period, a popular saying in Spain was “A tal casa tal aldaba,” or “To each house its door knocker.” This referred to the practice of displaying a resident’s social status or profession on their front door through the design of its knocker. This spilled over into the colonial city of Cartagena, which today displays an impressive array of knockers throughout the Old Town. Take a stroll through the historic center and you’ll soon come across examples of these stylized door knockers, often attached to large wooden doors from the colonial period. At the time, the designs had specific and concrete meanings. A knocker shaped as a fish or other sea creature meant the owner of the house was a member of the sea merchant community, or some other trade related to the sea. Lion head door knockers represented members of the army, militia leaders, and other protectors of the city. Lion heads are quite common, which is no surprise considering Cartagena’s history of fending off pirates and English armadas. The clergy, meanwhile, marked their homes with knockers in the shape of hands. And if you were knocking on the door of a home with a lizard-shaped knocker, then you’d better be wearing your finest clothes. These were the homes of high society, typically with some kind of royal connection. In all cases, the size and quality of the door knocker was also demonstrative of the resident’s social status: If you wanted to show off your credentials to passersby, only a finely crafted big brass knocker would do. Not all of the door knockers in the city today are old, however, as the tradition of making knockers has continued into the present day. Cartagena’s modern door knockers, while still pretty and functional, often dispense with tradition in favor of, well, whatever the homeowner desires.  For a day of door knocker-spotting, head to the Old Town and stroll around districts like San Diego and Matuna. Keep an eye out for large wooden doors, especially in wealthier areas, which are the most likely to have impressive door knockers.",culture colonialism houses homes architectural oddities history architecture

In life, Claver became known as “Apostle of the Blacks” – or more derisively by his slavery-approving Jesuit brothers “Slave of the Slaves”– after arriving in Colombia from his birthplace in Verdú, Spain. Born to a prosperous Catholic family in 1581, the bright and pious Claver became a Jesuit at age 20 and promptly shipped off from his birthplace in Verdú, Spain, never to return to his homeland. Upon arrival in Cartagena, Claver found it essential to his ministry to meet the slave ships as they pulled into port. For nearly 40 years, he would board the ships before they’d been emptied of their living contents, navigating cargo holds full of terrified captives in order to be the first, lone face of kindness they would see in the New World. From there, he would follow their path to the holding pens, providing sustenance in tangible forms as well as spiritual. After his death in 1654 inside a small room within the Jesuit cloisters at the church that would later come to bear his name, word of his life spread around the world. A modest museum adjacent to the church dedicated to Claver has become a place of reflection and contemplation for all those who have been touched by the saint’s work, directly or otherwise. Under the church’s altar, the bodily remains of Claver rest in an illuminated case. Throughout the museum, religious works of art that date back centuries are displayed alongside Pre-Colombian archeological pieces. Many rooms and open air halls are lined with paintings and other creations either inspired by or featuring Claver himself. Visitors are permitted access to the rooms where he spent his final days, and firsthand accounts report an eerie feeling of being observed for the duration of one’s visit, though were this true, a more benevolent watcher seems hard to imagine.

The preserved remains were first discovered in the 1950s, when the local cemetery was relocated due to a flood. Some of the town’s natives believe the local diet, which involves the guatila and the balu, two unusual fruits that are commonly eaten in the area, is responsible for the mummified remains. But a dietary explanation is unlikely, as the mummies’ outfits are also well-preserved. Others point to the area’s climate and high altitude, which are slightly more plausible reasons as to why the dead refuse to rot. This isn’t the first Latin American country to sport spontaneously mummified residents. In Guanajuato, Mexico, underground gas and the chemical composition of the soil cause bodies to remain relatively intact after burials. For whatever the reason, those who are buried within the boundaries of San Bernardo are mummified without any sort of accidental chemical intervention. Today, these mummies can be observed within the town’s cemetery, where a mausoleum was recently built to display some of the most complete and best preserved bodies. These mummies are curated by the families of those being displayed and their biographies are shared by their close ones. Tourists can pass through to look at the unusual spectacle, while locals can pop in to see the absurdly intact corpses of their neighbors and kin.

None of these interesting creatures, however, stand out quite as much as the blue anole (Anolis gorgonae), the world’s only pure blue reptile. Only found on this small Colombian island. Little is known about this unique and striking species of anole. Despite multiple scientific excursions to learn more about the nature of the distinctive lizard, the blue anole’s elusive behavior has made it difficult for scientists to properly study the population and their numbers. It is known that the anole is highly threatened as a result of habitat loss and the introduction of other fauna onto the island. The blue anole saw the greatest threat to its conservation during the 1950s when a penal colony was constructed on Gorgona to house some of Colombia’s most dangerous criminals. Despite the prison’s closure in 1984 (and the island’s subsequent designation as a natural national park), the blue anole population has yet to recover. Recently, introduced species such as western basilisks have been preying on the blue anole, further threatening the species. There are now plans to place the rare reptile in a captive breeding program to safeguard its existence for generations to come.  The island is accessible via boat from Buenaventura and Guapi. Daily flights are available from Bogotá and Cali to Buenaventura, and to Guapi from Cali. There is a small entrance fee to the national park and gumboots are provided, by either the navy or travel guides, and must be worn throughout the entire stay on the island.

The park is home to nearly two dozen sculptures by Colombia’s best-loved sculptor, including voluptuous ladies, fat cats, portly Roman soldiers, and chubby men on even chunkier horses. Colombian sculptor Fernando Botero has an instantly recognizable style that’s popular across the globe. You might have seen his work along Park Avenue in New York, or the Champs-Élysées in Paris, and you’ll most certainly have seen his sculptures if you’ve spent much time in Colombia, especially in his birthplace of Medellín. His figures are known for their exaggerated volume, their voluptuousness, their big-boned bravado; some might say they’re just plain fat. And no one is immune to Boterismo: men and women, dogs and cats, historical figures, they all get the same treatment, and it’s all good fun, whether the underlying message is political or just done to extract a smile. If you’re in Medellín and you want to spend some time in the company of a herd of bronze Boteros, you won’t find anywhere better than the 75,347-square-foot Plaza Botero. Twenty-three Botero sculptures live in the park, which the city of Medellín installed between the Palacio de Cultura Uribe Uribe and the Museo de Antioquia in 2002 as part of an urban renewal program. All the pieces were donated by Fernando Botero himself. It’s hard to pick a highlight among the large and lovably rotund sculptures. Classic Botero nudes display their corpulent beauty among the native ceiba, palm, and yellow lignum vitae trees. Massive cats and dogs sit smiling in the sun; a giant hand reaches up to the sky; a strange and chubby Sphinx-like figure crouches on a plinth. There’s a fat, suited man riding an impossibly paunchy horse, and a Roman soldier whose girth is the stuff of legends. It’s all signature Botero at its finest. And, beyond that, Plaza Botero is a prime example of one of Medellín’s impressively successful attempts at urban renewal, transforming what was previously a run-down area into a joyful, family-friendly park that celebrates art, learning, and Colombia’s indomitable sense of fun.  Plaza Botero is located in the Old Quarter of Medellín, close to the Parque Berrio Metro Station in the center of the city. It's a popular tourist destination, and can get a little crowded, so you might have to be patient if you want to get a clear shot of the sculptures. The tourists have also attracted plenty of local vendors selling souvenirs, soft drinks, and chewing gum. Pickpockets also frequent the plaza, so keep a firm grip on your wallet.",sculpture gardens public art parks sculptures art
297,Casa Museo Pablo Escobar,"Medellín, Colombia","This unofficial museum details the rise and fall of Colombia's most notorious narcotrafficker, Pablo Escobar.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-museo-pablo-escobar,"Pablo Escobar, the son of a farmer and school teacher, led the Medellín drug cartel, which supplied an estimated 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. Known as the wealthiest criminal in history, Escobar had an estimated known net worth of $25 to 30 billion dollars by the early ’90s. In the 1970s, Escobar started his criminal life by kidnapping for ransom, before moving into smuggling for contraband smugglers. He soon graduated to setting up a distribution channel for cocaine himself while establishing smuggling routes to the United States. The Medellín cartel managed operations via air, land, and sea through sophisticated operational processes. At its height, the cartel earned over $420 million while distributing over 20 tons of cocaine per week. Escobar and his cartel were also considered responsible for the deaths of over 4,000 people including numerous government officials, journalists, informants, and policemen. Casa Museo Pablo Escobar details the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar, as told by his brother, Roberto Escobar. The museum exhibits include Escobar’s motorcycles (a pink Harley Davidson that he brought illegally from the United States), classic cars, even a gun allegedly used by Al Capone as well as other artifacts he used for establishing the drug transport routes. One car, in particular, was used by Escobar (with his cousin, Gustavo) to transport cocaine from Bolivia and Peru (as cocaine paste) into Colombia, a trip that took almost 125 hours one-way. Decades after his death, Escobar and his tumultuous life still intrigue Colombians and travelers alike. Today, Escobar’s gravesite can be found in the Cemetario Jardins Montescaro in Itagui.  The Casa Museo Pablo Escobar entrance fee is $30 USD. The museum has a small curio and souvenir store carrying key chains, mugs and Escobar memorabilia. Most taxi and Uber drivers know of the Casa Museo Pablo Escobar as well as where his grave is located. Mention “Tumba de Pablo Escobar en Cemetario Jardines Montesacro en Itagüí” or “Casa Museo Pablo Escobar."" The cemetery can also be accessed via metro by the Medellin metro line A south to Sabaneta station. Travelers should note that Casa Museo Pablo Escobar was temporarily closed in 2018 for not meeting the Colombian tourism guidelines. Check the museum's website for updates.",drugs museums
298,Santuario Nuestra Señora del Carmen,"Bogotá, Colombia","Towering high above the neighborhood of La Candelaria, the church is easily recognizable by its distinctive red-and-white striped facade.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santuario-nuestra-senora-del-carmen,"Santuario Nuestra Señora del Carmen, also known as The National Shrine of Our Lady of Carmen, is situated amongst a myriad of museums in the historical center of Bogotá. Towering high over La Candelaria neighborhood, the church can easily be recognized by its distinctive red-and-white striped facade–a pattern that also continues within its interiors. Built in the Florentine Gothic Style, the church is known for its Byzantine and Moorish touches, and stands out beautifully within the backdrop of the colonial neighborhood. Designed by architect Giovanni Buscaglione, construction for the church began in 1926 and the building was consecrated 12 years later. Buscaglione, who hailed from the Piedmont region in Italy, was not only an architect, but also a Salesian priest in the Roman Catholic Church. He designed a substantial number of religious and educational buildings in Colombia, including the Colegio de León XIII and the Greater Seminary of Medellín. Buscaglione was known for his confluence of styles, particularly merging Arabic and Islamic expressions (which inspired him during his travels in Egypt and Turkey) with Florentine Gothic style. Santuario Nuestra Señora del Carmen is perhaps his most well-known and beloved architectural work in Colombia. But by the late 1980s, much of Santuario Nuestra Señora del Carmen needed to be restored. Pollution, humidity, and general erosion had taken its toll on the church’s interiors. The mass riots that took place in Bogotá in 1948 had also damaged the exterior facade. In 1987, reconstruction efforts were approved: Mexican expert Rodolfo Vallín Magaña led the restoration of the Carmen Shrine, decorative interior painting, and mural work–much of which had been blackened from candle smoke and nearly erased over the years. The church’s location is also historically significant: it neighbors the site of the 17th-century church of Carmen, which served as a monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary under the invocation of Carmen until 1861. Today, Santuario Nuestra Señora del Carmen is Bogotá’s youngest National Monument, and was dedicated as such in 1993.  The church is open Monday to Friday from 7:00am – 7:30am and from 10:00am – 4:00pm, Saturday from 7:00am – 7:30am, and Sunday from 7:00am – 12:30pm.",
299,Darien Gap,"Choco, Colombia","Only gap in the 30,000-mile span of roads called the Pan-American Highway.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/darien-gap,"To fully appreciate what the Darién Gap represents, one must first learn about the Pan-American Highway. This highway stretches nearly 30,000 miles from the northern shore of Alaska to the southernmost tip of South America. Crossing mountain ranges, rivers, and deserts in an attempt to connect the North and South American continents, this road holds the Guinness World Record as the longest motorable road in the world. The only break in the highway is a 54-mile-wide missing piece known as the Darién Gap. Separating the countries of Panama and Colombia, the remote Darién region is the site a national park declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO due to its abundance of rare plants and wildlife. Besides being home to rare wildlife, the region is also populated by both indigenous people and a wide variety of paramilitary groups who earn money from drugs and kidnapping. Historical attempts to build a transportation route across the area have all encountered phenomenal problems from the geography and native populations. One such attempt was a railroad built by the British to allow for gold mining in the region. Visitors to the area are still confronted by abandoned railway equipment and track from this enterprise rusting in the jungle. Many successful crossings of the forbidding terrain have been accomplished over the years. The first serious expedition to make the journey was undertaken in 1960 with the use of a Land Rover vehicle nicknamed “The Affectionate Cockroach.” The first completely over-land crossing didn’t occur until the early 1970s when Ian Hibell used a bicycle to forge a path through the wilderness. The first completely over-land auto crossing took place in 1985 utilizing a modified CJ-5 Jeep. With this vehicle, Loren Upton spent 714 days journeying a total of just 125 miles to accomplish this feat. Today the region has a split personality. One face of the region is that of a fragile oasis, teeming with incredible biodiversity that requires protection to ensure its survival. The other face, however, is of an area with a reputation as one of the most dangerous places in the Western Hemisphere, covered in lethal mountainous jungle that is patrolled by bands of armed guerillas. The Darién Gap is made up of both extremes, a place of no trails, no police, and few guides. As such, it is a destination only for the most experienced, the most intrepid or the most foolhardy.

Little is known about Tierradentro, meaning “inside earth,” but the UNESCO World Heritage Site is unlike anywhere else in the world. The ruins are made up of a cluster of 162 ancient burial chambers—called hypogea—that are believed to date back to between 600 and 900, before Spanish colonization. Entrances to the tombs speckle four towering peaks, and sets of stairs carved into the volcanic rock descend into underground chambers, some no larger than a coat closet and others with multiple rooms. The walls are painted with vivid red, black, gray, and white geometric patterns and giant monolithic faces are etched into pillars on the sides and centers of the rooms. The tombs are believed to have been created for the ancient society’s elite: homes for the dead. Despite concerns that the ruins are deteriorating, the detailed paintings have stood the test of time. Between Tierradentro and the more than 500 megalithic statues in neighboring San Agustín, the zone is the continent’s largest collection of prehistoric sculpture—and that includes Chile’s Easter Island.  To reach the Tierradentro ruins, travelers can take a bus from the nearest city, Popayán, which leave every day at 10:30 a.m. to the nearby towns of San Andres de Pisimbala or San Andres. The buses travel a rugged route through the mountains that can last anywhere from three to seven hours. It’s recommended to stay at least one or two nights in the small towns, which host a mix of hotels and restaurants.",tombs mountains archaeology

There’s a whole park downtown filled with 23 statues he donated to the city. But Botero’s most poignant statues are several blocks south in gritty San Antonio Plaza. On the right stands a typical Botero bronze, a cartoonishly fat and cheerful bird, standing squatly. On the left a few steps away stands the same statue, blasted to pieces, an enormous hole torn through its abdomen. In 1995, there was only one bird. In June of that year, 22 pounds of dynamite left at the base of the statue exploded during an outdoor concert, killing 30 and injuring more than 200. The leftist guerrilla group FARC initially took responsibility for the bombing, and claimed it was a message aimed at Colombia’s then-defense minister Fernando Botero Zea, Botero’s son. FARC said it was seeking to punish Botero Zea for not engaging in peace negotiations with FARC, and that it had only sought to destroy his father’s statue. The bombing came towards the end of Medellin’s era as the world’s most violent city. The violence had mostly subsided after the killing of Pablo Escobar in 1993, and today it’s one of the safest cities in South America. Botero was defiant about the bombing. In 2000, he donated the identical, undamaged bronze bird. He insisted that the exploded statue remain in the plaza. Today the names of the bombing victims are carved on its base. The statues are located on the east side of the plaza.",bombs birds statues animals art

This is a story about hard work, persistence, and true love. The original house is over 150 years old, nestled in the heart of Envigado, Colombia. When the owner, Santiago, was a kid, he dreamed of buying this home, which belonged to his aunt at the time. Eventually he did, and began making it into something special for his beloved wife Gloria. Every day for 32 years, he brought home rocks and stones from his work because he wanted to make her the most beautiful stone house in the world.  He decorated each room from wall to wall and ceiling to floor with intricate designs from rocks, pebbles, and rarities that he found during his travels. No detail was spared and no wall was forgotten. Today Santiago shares this house with Gloria, and they love to show their home to visitors.

Now long dead, their remains lay hidden beneath layers of earth, waiting to be discovered. This one was lucky enough, not only to be discovered, but to have an entire museum built around it. The hills around Villa de Leyva are littered with fossils, remnants of a time when the arid landscape was bubbling away under a couple fathoms of seawater. Finding small fossils was a daily occurrence. But one afternoon in 1977, some local farmers stumbled across the massive, near-complete skeleton of a Kronosaurus, a Cretaceous-period relative of the crocodile. In a tiny hamlet such as the one in which El Fosil is situated, this was big news, so the community made the decision to preserve and educate by building a museum around the behemoth. Stretching around 7 metres long from the tip of its nose to where the vertebrae of the tail would begin, the fossil is dated at about 110 to 115 million years old. The hypothesis is that the poor beast swam too close to the coast and beached itself in the mud, and that the tail and back left flipper are missing due to other predators or scavengers carrying them off. The museum is more or less just the one room. Cases displaying a sizeable collection of smaller marine fossils line the walls, including skeletons of dolphinlike Icthyosaurs, prehistoric tubeworms, and a whole lot of ammonites.

Through photos, videos, voices, and artifacts, the somber but important space looks to the dark past of armed conflict and the drug cartels while steadfastly paying tribute, and remembering, the many victims. By the end of the 1980s, Medellín was considered one of the most dangerous cities in the world. Pablo Escobar and the drug cartels had unleashed a wave of violence that would plague the city and Colombia for decades to come. Even after the death of Escobar in December 1993, crime rates remained high, and paramilitary groups like FARC and the AUC continued to destabilize the entire country. Then came Operation Orion in 2002, the largest urban military operation ever to take place in Colombia, whose goal was to disband the urban militias in Medellín. But almost immediately after the military intervention, the members of these groups formed further criminal gangs who continued to terrorize the city. In 2006, four years after Operation Orion, the Victim Assistance Program in Medellín began to assemble the source material for what would eventually become the Museo Casa de la Memoria, or House of Memory Museum. The three-floor museum was finally opened in 2012, as a place of remembrance, reflection, and a firm reminder to future generations that strategies are still needed to ensure such violence never takes place again. The museum houses an impressive range of multimedia exhibits that tell the history of Medellín and explain, in often stark fashion, the city’s violent past. Interactive maps highlight areas of Medellín affected by massacres; hundreds of testimonies can be heard, viewed and read; works of art depict the conflict; and you can listen to powerful songs, mainly hip-hop and rap, that talk of the violence. The bottom floor is dedicated to temporary exhibits, which change roughly once every year. On the upper floor, meanwhile, is a public library and archive with touchscreen computers where anyone can research the entire scope of Medellín’s troubled past.  The Museo Casa de la Memoria is located at Calle 51 no. 36-66 in Parque Bicentenario. You can get to the museum by taking the Metro to Estación San Antonio and then the Tranvía to Estación Bicentenario, or take the bus (Caicedo 093, 094 or 095, which goes to Parque Bicentenario).

Rain drenches the earth, and low-lying clouds often cling to the wet ground. The air is cold, wet, and raw. And yet somehow, life still thrives in and around this unfriendly terrain. Sumapaz Páramo is the world’s largest páramo (alpine tundra) ecosystem. Despite being within the jurisdiction of the bustling City of Bogotá (and its harsh climate), its name literally translates to “utterly peaceful moorland.” The páramo is a hotspot for biodiversity. It’s home to the spectacled bear, which is South America’s only surviving native bear species. The bears feast upon the flora that thrives there. Frailejones, a type of subshrub in the sunflower family, is its most iconic plant. The area has long been important to humans, too. It was a sacred area for the indigenous Muisca people, and today, the páramo is a key water source for the Bogotá savanna, the most densely populated part of Colombia. There, water is aplenty—it rains for most of the year, the air is thick with humidity, and the soil is frequently saturated with water. The abundance of water does pose a bit of a threat to tourists. Thick vegetation conceals stretches of squelchy mud and shallow bodies of water. Visitors unaccustomed to the landscape have been known to fall into these natural “drainages,” which can result in injury and even death.  The Sumapaz Páramoo is fully delimited within the Sumapaz National Park and therefore has special protection under Colombian law.

Built by a Colombian who fell in love with the stars, the observatory has created almost a cult following among amateurs and professional astronomers alike. Tatacoa is technically a semi-dry tropical forest, but its arid conditions and Mars-like landscape mean many tend to mistake the region for a desert. Its dry desert-like climate and proximity to the equator—it lies 3.2324° N and 75.1688° W—make it perfect for star-gazing. Tatacoa is also extremely isolated, meaning there is no light pollution from any neighboring towns. In 2015, the observatory was opened by Javier Fernando Rua Restrepo, a self-taught astronomer who hails from Cali, and who fell in love with Tatacoa after traveling there as a university student. After saving up while working at the official government observatory, Restrepo decided to start his own and became so well known within astronomy circles that scientists sent him telescopes so he could adequately stock his observatory. The small building, which lies behind a makeshift tarpaulin fence, attracts stargazers from around the world, who come to see the magnificent array of stars on offer. On some nights, every single constellation—all 88 of them—can be seen from Tatacoa.  Check the cycle of the moon. If it’s a full moon, the stars won’t be so bright, so it’s best to go when the moon is in its waning crescent phase.

The journey along the tracks can be done on foot, by motor bike pillion (one of the locals will take you for 10,000 pesos or less) or by riding the antiquated, mine train (one of the locals will fire it up for 10,000 or so).

At the heart of this Colombian colonial gem lies a vast square paved with river stones, the largest plaza in Colombia and one of the largest in South America. Villa de Santa María de Leyva was founded on June 12, 1572, by Hernán Suárez de Villalobos, under the orders of Andrés Díaz Venero de Leiva, the first president of the New Kingdom of Granada (after whom the town is named). Built in the classic Spanish colonial style with whitewashed houses, cobbled streets and terracotta roofs, the town of some 17,000 people has been remarkably well-preserved. At the heart of Villa de Leyva lies an unusually large square–the largest in Colombia and one of the largest in South America–which on a quiet day seems excessively expansive. Apart from a small central fountain, the 150,695-square-foot (14,000-square-meter) plaza is a sea of cobbles surrounded by a sliver of low-lying whitewashed colonial buildings.  In colonial times up until the mid-20th century neither the plaza nor the streets of the town were paved with river stones.  The stones were added to keep dust storms at bay. The existence of this vast plaza in such a small town is due to two things: Villa de Leyva’s original function and, to a lesser extent, bored soldiers. The town was originally built to serve as a storage site for the region’s agricultural produce, so a large main square was required for all the incoming goods. The square itself was built by soldiers who had come to conquer the New World (and in this case the local indigenous Muisca), and who now found themselves with time on their hands. So when it came to building the square, it was a case of going big or going home. Around the main square and the old cobbled streets surrounding it are many more notable colonial buildings, including the Iglesia Catedral, Iglesia del Carmen, Museo Antonio Nariño, the San Francisco Convent, and the Casa del Congreso. There’s also La Mesopotamia, an old flour mill built four years before the foundation of Villa de Leyva and now converted into a hotel.  Villa de Leyva is about 75 miles northeast of Bogotá, or about four hours by bus. Tourism has boomed in the town in recent years, and some would argue that the town has lost some of its authenticity, despite the strict preservation of the buildings. If you want to avoid the crowds, who can certainly lessen the old colonial charm, avoid the weekends. If you like dinosaur fossils, you'll like Villa de Leyva, as many have been found in the surrounding area, the best of which are housed in the local museum.",

The public park encourages kids and adults alike to walk barefoot to better connect with their environment. In the mid-1990s, a three-hectare strip of land right in the middle of Medellín had become a bit of an eyesore. The semi-abandoned plot lay between some important buildings, including the Metropolitan Theater, and some heavily trafficked roads. Initial plans for redeveloping the plot of land were focused on building a parking lot. But then someone came up with a far better idea: to create a park where everyone walks barefoot. And so, in 1998, work began on Parque de los Pies Descalzos, or Barefoot Park. It was completed two years later, and soon became a popular spot for picnicking families, stressed-out city workers, and people who hate wearing shoes. Barefoot Park, as the name suggests, was designed to encourage people to take off their shoes and go for a wander. To inspire such reckless shedding of sneakers, flip-flops, high heels, and Crocs, the park features a series of barefoot-friendly areas. In the zen bamboo garden, you can kick off your shoes and connect with nature. There are lawns for picnics and shoeless strolls, and shallow pools surrounded by sandbars where splashing kids make the most of the beach-like atmosphere. And if you want to just sit back and relax, there are fountains and pools designed specifically for soaking your feet in the soothing water. Not a bad way to pass the time before returning to the conformist shoe-wearing ways of the city.  Parque de los Pies Descalzos is located along Calle 42 and Carrera 58 in the center of Medellín, not far from the Museo Interactivo EPM, Teatro Metropolitano, and Plaza Mayor.

The town even has its own traditional-style bullfighting ring. The homogeneous architecture is a bizarre, yet aesthetically pleasing, surprise within a country rich with vibrant styles of design. Guatavita “La Nueva” (the new one) was built in 1967 in the Spanish colonial style after its predecessor was intentionally flooded by a new reservoir. On a dry day, when the water level recedes, locals claim you can see the old bell tower poking above the surface. The local museum tells the story of the displacement and relocation of the people who once called the old Guatavita home. Even before it was flooded, area around Guatavita has had strong ties to water. A strangely circular lake, once a sacred spot for the native Muisca people, lies within the landscape. There, new rulers covered themselves in gold dust and floated out to the center of the lake as part of a ritual. The leader would then drop precious gold treasures into the lake as an offering to the gods. It’s believed the lake was the inspiration behind the famous El Dorado legend, which over the years morphed from being about a golden king to being about an entire empire of gold.

The small chapel was dedicated to the Virgen Morena de Monserrate, in homage to a similar sanctuary, which still stands today in the mountains outside Barcelona. This, however, wasn’t the mountain’s first encounter with religiosity. In typical colonial fashion, the mountaintop was chosen in large part due to its existing spiritual significance among the indigenous population. For many centuries before the arrival of Catholicism, the summit of Mount Monserrate, which rises to 10,341 feet (3,152 m) above sea level, was venerated by indigenous peoples of the region, most significantly the Muisca, who called the mountain quijicha caca, meaning “grandmother’s foot.” Once Catholicism had claimed the site, it wasn’t long before the sanctuary began to expand, and in the following decades, a monastery was added. Then, a local master craftsman named Don Pedro de Lugo y Albarracín made a statue for the chapel, which he called Santo Cristo caído a los azotes y clavado en la Cruz (“Holy Christ fell to the whip and nailed to the Cross”). Made from wood and metal, it has since become one of the most important religious statues in Colombia. In times of crisis—be it a drought or failed harvest or earthquake—the effigy of the fallen Christ is carried down to the city, followed by a massive crowd of praying devotees. Many pilgrims now make their way up to the sanctuary specifically to visit the shrine of El Señor Caido. The sanctuary itself has survived a number of earthquakes over the centuries, quakes that destroyed other religious buildings in the area. In 1917, an earthquake did cause extensive damage to the Montserrat sanctuary, at which point a new church was built. Completed in 1925, this new church built in the neo-Gothic style was constructed with the help of many pilgrims who flocked to the sanctuary on foot, each carrying at least one brick up the mountain to aid in the sanctuary’s re-construction.  There are now three ways to visit the Sanctuary of Monserrate. The traditional way— and that favored by pilgrims—is via a 1.5-mile walk along a trail up the side of the mountain from the city. The path is open from 5 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily. Alternatively, you can take the funicular railway, built in 1929, or the teleférico (cable car) that began operating in 1955. Daily masses are held at the sanctuary from 8 a.m to 10 a.m and midday to 2 p.m. Avoid Easter Weekend, the lines are hours long, and getting back down can take two or three hours unless you opt to walk down.",mountain bogota colombia sanctuaries churches sacred spaces
314,Museo Botero,"Bogotá, Colombia",A celebration of Colombia’s premier contemporary artist.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-botero,"A voluptuous ‘Mona Lisa,’ corpulent dancers, juicy still lifes, and buxom nudes hang in Museo Botero (the Botero Museum), a popular museum in the Colombian capital of Bogotá. It was established in 2000 when the artist donated over 120 of his own artworks and 85 pieces from his personal collection to the Banco de la República, which operates the museum out of a colonial manor house in the city’s historic neighborhood of La Candelaria. Fernando Botero’s full-bodied aesthetic can be seen in the way of fine artworks and large public sculptures in major cities and institutions around the world. His penchant for curvaceous subjects—men, women, children, animals, even bowls of fruit—is beloved in his native Colombia and beyond; but since the 1970s, Botero has also amassed his own collection of historic masterpieces by seminal artists including the French-Russian multidisciplinary modernist Marc Chagall, legendary Spanish Surrealist Salvador Dalí, and Claude Monet, leader of the French Impressionist movement. The museum’s east wing is where visitors can find paintings by the above, and beyond, with works on view ranging from a 19th-century piece entitled Gitane au tambourin by the French painter and draughtsman Camille Corot, all the way up to a late 20th-century oil painting by the Spanish contemporary artist Miquel Barceló. According to Google Arts & Culture, the excellence and expanse of Botero’s acquisitions places Museo Botero “among the five most important public international art collections in Latin America.” More than 120 paintings, sculptures, and sketches by Botero himself are exhibited in the museum’s west wing. The collection illustrates Botero’s visual lexicon referred to as “Boterismo,” a style characterized by bloated subjects that reference and rift on art history, yet also belong to the artist’s entirely unique personal aesthetic. Approximately 1,000 people visit Museo Botero per day to peruse the collection, join a tour, participate in a workshop, or attend a lecture. The museum’s collection was co-curated by Botero himself and donated on the condition that all artworks remain permanently in the space.  Museo Botero is open Wednesday through Monday, 9 am to 7 pm every day except for Sunday, when it closes at 5 pm. The museum is closed on Tuesdays. Audio guides are available in Spanish, English, and French. No entrance fee.",

Covering over 16,000 hectares, Parque Arvi is known for its wildflowers, nature tours and over 54 miles of hiking trails. Within the park rests sections of prehistoric ruins including waterworks pathways, platforms, gardens, trenches, and roads. The “pre-hispanic trail”—or the Camino Cienza de Leon—is assumed to be over 1,500 years old. Offering spectacular views of Medellín and the surrounding Aburra Valley, the high terrain running through the western part of Parque Arvi is one the most preserved trails leading to the Laguna de Guarne and Seca Lake region. Parque Arvi also boasts an outdoor regional food market and an Ecological Hotel. Guests to the park can enjoy nature tours, cycling, outdoor adventure sports, and guided hikes such as a two-hour butterfly (and flora) tour— called the “Porton de Guabayo”—that identifies native butterflies in the park. Other tours include nightly guided-hikes showcasing the regional cultural exchange through music, and campfire discussions on Medellín history and folklore.  Within Parque Arvi, the Environmental and Cultural Center is open to visitors year round, offering events, educational tours, a food court, and the Arvi store. The Arvi Market, or the Mercado Arví, is located at the entrance of the cable entry. The market highlights regional farmers and craftsmen where products include handicrafts, foods and agricultural products of the Santa Elena region. The Market has been established to revitalize the regional economy highlighting rural community tourism. Piedras Blancas Hotel and Ecological Park near Parque Arvi has a museum and hotel space along with boat rentals, canopy, and even a butterfly garden. Located near the Piedras Blancas dam, and surrounded by native forests, a longer trip to Parque Arvi should definitely include a stay in this hotel. You can also experience Parque Arvi as a quick stop during your visit to Medellin.

317,Virgen Rosa Mística (Virgin of the Mystic Rose),"Medellín, Colombia",The religious shrine that Pablo Escobar's men would allegedly visit before completing a mission.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rosa-mistica,"Said to be where the brutal sicarios (hitmen) of the infamous Colombian drug lord, Pablo Escobar, would pray, the shrine of the Mystic Rose is a hidden religious destination in Medellín built by its patrons. The surrounding grotto lives in a piece of a mountain found in the Poblado neighborhood and is paved with plaques donated by thankful followers. “Mystic Rosa” is known as a mystery because of her ability to grant miracles both good and bad, especially ones that Escobar’s Medellín Cartel allegedly asked her for. Referred to as the “Virgin of the Sicarios,” which translates to “Virgin of the Assassins,” it is rumored that the wealthy kingpin built this shrine from rubble found in the formerly-abandoned grotto and embedded the virgin’s image within it to express his gratitude. Twenty years ago, this unassuming pilgrimage center honored a different biblical theme: Immaculate Conception. Today, various souvenirs extolling the Mystic Rose are sold within. Though, at one point, Pablo Escobar was the world’s most wanted man, his “Robin Hood” reputation for sharing his wealth with impoverished Colombian neighborhoods explains his careful curation of this shrine. Ultimately, the Virgin of the Mystic Rose is an intimate cavern, created for the sole purpose of freely expressing love for the Virgin. Equal parts religious and historical, this grotto-enveloped shrine offers a meditative break from the busy surrounding city of Medellín.   Free, open to the public, and easy to access. Taking a cab is suggested since there is no parking. This place is known locally and does not have a reputation for being dangerous.",colombia grottoes drugs shrines religion sacred spaces

It was also Colombia’s tallest building until the construction of the Primatial Cathedral of Bogotá in 1823. The creation of the observatory was the initiative of Spanish priest, botanist, and mathematician José Celestino Mutis, whose contribution to the Spanish-American Enlightenment is famously recognized. Shortly after its construction, Mutis entrusted the National Observatory to Francisco José de Caldas, a martyr of the independence movement and scientist, who permitted its use as a place of reunion to conspire against the Spanish Empire. After the Spaniards executed Caldas in 1816, scientific activity at the observatory became null until Simón Bolívar, liberator of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, ordered its reactivation in 1823. This was done to incentivize the development of engineering and natural sciences in the newly founded republics. In the 1860s, the observatory was witness to more political structures. It served brief stints as a fortress and prison. Today, the National Observatory is still in operation. It is currently managed by the Faculty of Science of the National University of Colombia.  The National Observatory is located within presidential palace grounds, therefore visitors must register their visit at least 30 days in advance on the Casa de Nariño webpage. Once cleared to enter the presidential palace grounds, visitors will be scheduled to a free of charge 45-minute guided tour which includes a visit to the National Observatory. One can also walk pass the observatory by taking Carrera 8 from the iconic Plaza de Bolívar.",observatories space exploration
319,Teleférico la Garrucha (Garrucha Cable Car),"Jardín, Colombia",Would you dare to dangle from a great height in a wooden basket?,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jardin-wooden-cable-car,"In the coffee belt of Colombia’s Antioquia province, the tidy town of Jardín is located alongside a steep ravine. There are a couple of ways to cross it, including an impressive suspension bridge completed just a few years ago. But possibly the most direct method, and certainly the most fun, is in a wooden basket known as La Garrucha. At first, the scene appears ridiculously hazardous: Travelers ride in a box made of haphazard wooden slats strung on a pair of drooping cables across a heart-stoppingly deep ravine. The slats are painted in jaunty yellow and green, as if to distract passengers from the terrifying prospect of plummeting into the gorge and disappearing in the fathomless foliage below. A closer look is a bit more reassuring: The steel cables appear shiny and new, the motor hums contentedly, and the passengers are a mix of ho-hum locals on their everyday commute and tourists enjoying the ride. Still, as the woman at the ticket window acknowledges, the journey is “not fun for nervous people.” La Garrucha was originally installed as a way to transport people, supplies, and produce between the town center and the agricultural area to the south. It still serves those purposes, and now additionally acts as a visitor attraction and even as a symbol of Jardín. For a fare equivalent to about a dollar, anyone can step into the rickety-looking basket, dangle over the yawning gorge, and step out on the other side. Once there, visitors can enjoy a coffee or a snack from an open-air cafe, admire the view of Jardín’s rooftops and church steeples across the ravine—and get their nerve up for the return trip in La Garrucha.  La Garrucha holds 5-6 people at a time, costs 4000 pesos (a little over $1) each way. It runs every half-hour.",elevators mountains transportation

The bridge, which was named after its location on the western side of Colombia, was designed by architect José María Villa, who had previously worked on the Brooklyn Bridge. He used that previous experience to design and construct this bridge, adjusting it to the local conditions. This can be noted on the cable-stayed-suspension hybrid structural system and the wooden pedestrian passageways, which were employed in both structures. The construction of this structure spearheaded an industrial revolution in the nation. Before there was a bridge on this part of the Cauca River, the only other method to get around the waterway was by finding a narrow passageway farther south. The bridge facilitated the connection between the interior of Colombia and the Caribbean Sea, and therefore became an essential player in developing the country’s economy. Today, the bridge remains in use and is a local attraction due to its importance for the development of the Antioquia region, which grants it a symbolic reference for the strength and unity for the people who inhabit the area.  The bridge is located between the towns of Santa Fe de Antioquia and Olaya on the Cauca River.",urban planning engineering infrastructure transportation bridges architecture
321,Gorgona Island Prison Ruins,"Guapi, Colombia",This maximum-security prison was abandoned to make way for a national park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gorgona-island-prison-ruins,"Sometimes called the “Alcatraz of Latin America,” Gorgona Island is home to an abandoned prison now completely overrun by the Pacific island’s unique flora and fauna. Originally named San Felipe, the island was later renamed after the Gorgons, creatures from Greek mythology whose hair was made of snakes, due to the high number of venomous snake bites suffered during the Spanish colonial era. In 1959, after Colombia made it illegal for private individuals to own islands in the country, a maximum-security prison was built on Gorgona Island to house some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals. The men incarcerated in Gorgona’s prison were stripped from their identities and instead assigned numbers. The harsh and inhumane living conditions coupled with the fact that the island’s shark-infested waters and poisonous snakes made it very difficult for inmates to escape gave the prison a widely-known reputation. While the Gorgona prison was active, there were a total of 25 escape attempts, three of which were successful. After a little over two decades in operation, the Gorgona prison was closed down in 1984. The entirety of the island and its surrounding waters were turned into a national park the following year. Today the landscape is a protected wildlife habitat home to many rare species that live among the ruins of the abandoned maximum-security prison. Much like the Galápagos Islands, Gorgona is home to a unique ecosystem influenced by thousands of years of separation from the mainland. The island is the sole habitat of the blue anole (Anolis gorgonae), the only all-blue lizard in the world. It’s also home to the brown-throated sloth, the capuchin monkey, and a large population of venomous snakes. The island is a popular spot for scuba diving since it’s not uncommon to spot whale sharks, hammerheads, white tip reef sharks, and moray eels. Whale-watching is possible annually, between June and October, as the island is a prime breeding and calving location for humpback whales. Today, a navy station on Gorgona is responsible for preserving the integrity of the island’s ecosystem, maintaining the old prison ruins, and supervising the safety of the visitors. Local guides are available year-round and strict regulations, like curfews and wearing gumboots, are enforced to help preserve the local ecosystem and prevent visitors from getting bit by the slithery inhabitants of the island.  The island is accessible via boat from Buenaventura and Guapi. Daily flights are available from Bogotá and Cali to Buenaventura, and to Guapi from Cali. There is a small entrance fee to the island/national park. Gumboots are provided and must be worn throughout the entire stay. A hotel and restaurant are also open year-round on the island.

It was built with Colombian iron. German artist Dieter Patt had the iron shipped to Germany after coming up with the idea in early 2005. Patt, a Shakira super fan if there ever was one, supports many charity projects in Colombia, including the singer’s Pies Descalzos (Barefoot) Foundation. The statue weighs six tons and is inscribed with a quote from Shakira: “When you look at me, think that you too can accomplish what you want.” After spending a few months in Neuss, Germany, the statue was taken apart and shipped to Colombia. Initially the plan was to install the monument next to the airport, but Shakira wanted it to be visible whenever, wherever to the youth of Barranquilla to inspire their own dreams. In 2006, the statue went up in Metropolitan Park next to Estadio Metropolitano, a soccer stadium where Shakira has performed. During its unveiling, fire was set to paper wrapped around the 16-foot-tall statue, revealing the iron pop star in all her glory. A benefit concert featuring local performers and regional music and dance groups followed. Shakira, whose IQ may or may not be 140, said of the statue’s, well, lack of resemblance to her: “One day I can go to the statue with my children and tell them, ‘Hey, this is apparently your mother, but don’t you think I look better in real life?’”",guitar music monuments statues
323,La Alpujarra Administrative Center,"Medellín, Colombia","In the heart of Medellín, an artsy urban complex sets the stage for demonstrations and protests.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-alpujarra-administrative-center,"Built in the 1980s, La Alpujarra Administrative Center is, at first glance, a slightly stark urban complex in the heart of Medellín. Between the important and imposing government buildings, you’ll find notable sculptures and, on occasion, a demonstration or two. La Alpujarra Administrative Center is, first and foremost, the location of some of Medellín’s most important administrative buildings, including the town hall, the main government offices, the national tax administration, the city courthouse, and various other buildings you probably never want to have to visit, at least not on official business. To be fair, some of these concrete structures are quite impressive in their own right: blocky, clean-cut towers back-dropped by the blue skies of Medellín. But what makes La Alpujarra more interesting for the casual visitor are the sculptures dotted around the square and adjoining areas. The most notable and important work is Monumento a la Raza (Monument to Race) by acclaimed Colombian sculptor Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt, whose sculptures are found in most of Colombia’s principal cities. The 125-feet-tall (38 m) sculpture recounts the history of the region’s conquered indigenous people and the heroic deeds of the Antioquia department, with figures formed in dramatically twisting concrete and metal. Another monument is the Homenaje a los Doctores Guillermo Gaviria y Gilberto Echeverri by Salvador Arango. This sculpture pays tribute to former Antioquia Governor Guillermo Gaviria and peace commissioner Gilberto Echeverry, both of whom were kidnapped and killed during the reign of Pablo Escobar. Other sculpted figures in the square pay tribute to the unnamed and often overlooked people of the city. These include a bronze statue of a shoe-shine man, a wandering street vendor, and a lottery ticket salesman, all sculpted by Olga Inés Arango.  La Alpujarra Administrative Center is located in downtown Medellín. Most buses in the city center pass by this area, or you can take the metro to Alpujarra Station and then walk the short distance to the main square. Be aware that this area is a popular spot for protests and demonstrations. In 2008, more than 200,000 people gathered to protest the guerrilla military organization FARC. Student demonstrations are also common, and political rallies near election times.",medellin colombia sculptures

But each evening, this little park is filled with the cacophonous chatter of Canary-winged parakeets coming home to roost for the night. The parakeets, known locally as pericos, have been roosting in Parque Santander for well over a decade. Thousands of them descend upon the park at dusk, having returned from feeding in the forests that surround Leticia. Some branches even bend under the weight of the tiny birds as they jostle for a prime sleeping spot. The best way to catch this nightly event is to arrive at the park around 5:00 or 5:30 p.m. and stay until it gets dark. Bring earplugs if you have sensitive ears—thousands of shrieking parakeets can make a lot of noise. For a better look at the birds and sweeping views of the rest of the city, you can climb the tower of the white church adjacent to the park. If you stay a little longer after sundown, you’ll see the “shift change” as bats come out to feed on insects that hover around the streetlamps. The park also features a fountain and some bizarre public art, ranging from whitewashed statues of Christian figures to bronzes of indigenous peoples and Amazonian wildlife.  The park is easy to find from the riverside Malecón Turistico. Walk two blocks up to Carrera 10 and go left until you see the ring of pillars and the fountain.",public sounds birds parks animals art
325,Pablo Escobar's Grave,"Itagüi, Colombia",The (usually) serene burial place of the world's most notorious drug lord.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pablo-escobars-grave,"The notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar died in a shootout with the Colombian National Police on December 2, 1993. He was buried in the peaceful Cemetario Jardines Montesacro in Itagüí, just south of Medellín, where Escobar grew up. Escobar’s headstone sits in a family gravesite within the cemetery, alongside those of his parents and other relatives. Sometimes adorned with freshly laid flowers, and occasionally attracting a family member, a friend or a curious tourist, the grave is a strangely serene resting place for a man whose actions caused so much terror and death, and whose cartel once supplied about 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. But the normally tranquil gravesite has not been free from its own controversies. In 2017, American rap artist Wiz Khalifa was performing in Medellín, and took the time to visit the grave. He posed for photos at the grave, apparently smoking marijuana, and posted them to his Instagram account. These were widely interpreted as Khalifa paying tribute to Escobar, and an outcry inevitably ensued. According to CNN at the time, Medellín’s mayor, Federico Gutierrez, told local media, “That scoundrel, instead of bringing flowers to Pablo Escobar, he should have brought flowers to the victims of violence in this city.” A year later, in 2018, reports began to surface of a new “cocaine pilgrimage” trend, possibly inspired by the hit Netflix show Narcos. Tourists began posting photos and videos of themselves snorting lines of cocaine off Escobar’s headstone, often accompanied by less than insightful comments. Needless to say, local authorities are very much against such behavior.  You can get to Cementerio Jardines Montesacro by taking the Medellín Metro Line A south to Sabaneta Station in Itagüí. From there it's about a 10-minute walk to the cemetery, crossing the Autopista Sur road (Carrera 42). Just inside the entrance to the cemetery is a path that leads up some stairs to the church on the hill.

326,BD Bacatá,"Bogotá, Colombia",The world's first crowdfunded skyscraper has not gone quite to plan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bd-bacata,"Financed by 3,800 ordinary Colombians, the BD Bacatá was the world’s first crowdfunded skyscraper. Unfortunately, both the skyscraper and its financial backers have been left in limbo as Colombia’s tallest building waits for completion. Great things were expected from the Bogotá Downtown Bacatá. Not only was it to become the tallest building in Colombia and the first skyscraper built in the country for 35 years, it was also going to be the world’s first crowdfunded skyscraper. Lofty goals indeed, but for now, at least, things are very much up in the air. Construction began on the two towers of the BD Bacatá in 2011, with the whole project funded by around 3,800 regular Colombians. The planned building had basically been divided up into thousands of identical parts called FiDis (from “derecho fiduciario,” or “fiduciary right”). Ownership rights to the physical building were then sold, at a cost of $20,000 over two years, with a down payment of 10%. The crowdfunded project raised more than $170 million, and construction went ahead. Six years later, everything was looking OK. The BD Bacatá was largely finished, including both towers, the tallest of which had 67 floors and a total height of 709 feet (216 m). This made the BD Bacatá the tallest building in Colombia, having surpassed the Torre Colpatria, also in Bogotá, which had previously held the record since 1979. Combined with the second tower (57 floors at 548 feet), the BD Bacatá featured 405 apartments, 117 offices, a shopping center with 32 stores, and a hotel with 364 rooms. It was all looking good until 2018, when BD Promotores, the company in charge of the construction project, appeared to be on the verge of going broke. Venerando Lamelas, a Spanish real estate promoter and president of BD Promotores, began to reassure his investors that everything would work out fine in the end. In April 2018 he announced that apart from finishing the hotel and a few other small details, the BD Bacatá was almost finished. As of February 2019, however, there are still many investors waiting to move in to their homes and businesses in Colombia’s tallest building. And if it takes much longer, the BD Bacatá won’t even have that record to cling to. A new skyscraper, Torres Atrio, is due to be completed in Bogotá in 2019. Once completed, the taller of its two towers will have a height of 879 feet, knocking the BD Bacatá into second place before it’s even finished.  The BD Bacatá is located at Calle 19, No. 5-20 in Bogotá, Colombia. Due to the current situation surrounding the project, concrete information about visiting hours etc. is unavailable. Not even the official BD Bacatá website seems to be working.",bogota colombia buildings architecture

Known as La Ciclovía, the initiative has inspired similar events across the world. Despite its often choking traffic, Bogotá is one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world. Not only is it home to the Cicloruta—the most extensive bicycle path network in Latin America—it also has a weekly event known as La Ciclovía. The origins of La Ciclovía date back to 1974 when the first event took place. And after the second event in 1976, a mayoral decree established La Ciclovía as an official program of the city government, initially with four routes. The program experienced some setbacks from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but the wheels really began turning in 1995, when the route was expanded from 13 miles to 75 miles. Since then, La Ciclovía has gone from strength to strength. Every Sunday between 7 a.m. and 2 p.m., more than one million people come to cycle, jog, skate and walk along the car-free roads. Serious cyclists pass by strolling pensioners; kids skate alongside Sunday dog walkers; and city-dwellers of all ages get to jog and run through various neighborhoods of Bogotá, all connected by La Ciclovía. But not everyone loves La Ciclovía. Many business owners complain about the loss of sales during La Ciclovía, and drivers frequently moan about the inconvenience of driving on a Sunday. Their complaints, however, largely fall on deaf ears. La Ciclovía has become a much-loved program, with about one-quarter of the city’s population making use of it every Sunday. As one of the world’s most successful mass recreation events, La Ciclovía has caught the attention of other countries, inspiring similar initiatives across the world. Ciclovías have sprung up in numerous countries, including in Peru, Chile, and Argentina; in Australia, Mexico and India; and in various cities in Canada and the United States.  La Ciclovía runs through most of Bogotá’s 20 districts, including the historic district of La Candelaria. The event takes place from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. every Sunday and on public holidays. In December 2018, the first nighttime Ciclovía took place as part of the Christmas celebrations, albeit on a slightly shorter route. So keep an eye out for occasional events outside the normal Sunday schedule.",

There’s also a man-made body of water surrounding the hacienda designed to keep animals from coming inside - a moat, of sorts, though it’s more of a stream, really. There’s a sewing room and a library, with the doorway into the sewing room being much smaller, since only women were allowed inside, of course (and it goes without saying that the ladies weren’t permitted into the library, either). While the hacienda is certainly worth a look, it pales in comparison to the lush grounds surrounding the modest house that once slept the early Colombian settlers, an industrialist family with 16 children.

Later, the coroner’s office report confirmed that Becerra never was in contact with a firearm, and the trial of the officers started. Unfortunately, the culprit found a way to escape and is now a fugitive. The bridge has now become a place to honor Becerra’s memory, and each year is the site of Tripido Fest, when local graffiti artists gather to pay tribute to him by painting murals related to Becerra’s story.

330,Vargas Swamp Lancers Memorial,"Sogamoso, Colombia",Largest monument in Colombia depicts 14 lancers who drove back an army.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vargas-swamp-lancers,"Created by artist Rodrigo Arenas Betancur, the Vargas Swamp Lancers Memorial is an impressively grandiose depiction of a frozen moment in time during an unlikely and successful skirmish during the Colombian War of Independence. The Vargas Swamp Battle was a conflict near Paipa in 1819, led by Simón Bolívar, who was attempting to push back Spanish forces to protect a poorly guarded vantage point. Despite exhausted troops and trekking through swampy terrain, the Patriot forces were able to overcome the Royalist army, a cavalry attack by only 14 Venezuelan Lancers being the final push needed for victory. The 108 ft. tall bronze monument is a memorial to the battle, and depicts the 14 brave soldiers on horseback, armed with nothing but their lances, boldly charging toward their mighty foe. It’s located in the Boyacá Department of Colombia. About 150 miles northeast of Bogota in central Andes highlands",monuments statues

332,Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino,"Santa Marta, Colombia",The 17th-century hacienda where Simón Bolívar spent his last days before dying from tuberculosis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/san-pedro-alejandrino-quinta,"Before Simón Bolívar, liberator of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, was scheduled to make his first trip back to Europe after leading a series of revolutionary wars across Latin America, a sudden worsening of his fight against tuberculosis forced him to confine himself to this hacienda, where he ultimately died. The hacienda, which was founded in 1608 and named after Pope Peter I of Alexandria, was just another example of a typical estate in colonial America where rum, honey, and panela were produced. This, however, changed after Bolívar was advised by Alejandro Próspero Révérend, a French field doctor who assisted in the fight against the Spanish, to intern himself at the quinta to recover. It was hoped the place’s serene atmosphere would help heal the ill revolutionary. But Bolívar was unable to recover. He died in the hacienda on December 17, 1830. After his death, much of the hacienda was left unchanged as a form of respect for the former leader. There are, however, a few newer additions to the site. Today, you’ll see new memorials in imposing white marble, a farm dedicated to demonstrating the production of sugarcane and spirits in a typical colonial-era hacienda, a botanical garden, and a museum. You can also find Bolívar’s deathbed along with a few of his belongings and gifts donated by multiple governments, artists, and other individuals to commemorate his leadership and commitment to the liberty, and fraternal unity, of Latin America.  You can take public transportation from the city's waterfront, or Carrera 1C, by taking the Mamatoco bus. The ride should take about 20 minutes.",estates colonial america death
333,Bolívar Desnudo (Nude Bolívar),"Pereira, Colombia","This unusual monument shows a naked Simón Bolívar stripped of clothing, medals, and swords.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bolivar-desnudo-nude-bolivar,"There’s something unusual about this statue of Simón Bolívar. The Liberator is perched atop a charging steed, his arm outstretched, as he races onward. The horse wears no tack, and, most unusually, Bolívar wears no clothing. The only public monument showing Bolívar without clothing, medals, or swords is a symbol of liberty and a message for equality. Wanting something unique to commemorate the centennial for the city of Pereira, Lázaro Nicholls, a past mayor, commissioned the famed sculptor Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt to come up with an image of Bolívar that would set up this city’s plaza apart from the rest. Initially the monument was going to depict a Bolívar fully dressed in military attire, however, the artist thought it was a better idea for the sculpture to portray the revolutionary in a different way. Stripped of his military garb and accolades, this statue exudes a sense of freedom. Bolívar is shown galloping on his stallion, unrestrained and independent, while charging onward. Bolívar’s nudity serves a second purpose, as the statue’s lack of clothing also symbolizes equality. Naturally, this unconventional depiction of Bolívar attracted its fair share of criticism and backlash. But today, more than 50 years since the monument was unveiled, it remains a celebrated local attraction.  The monument is located in the middle of the Plaza de Bolívar.",horses monuments statues

One day, the kids arrived at the park to find their beloved k-9 poisoned. According to the tale, Teddy bit one of the boys and was poisoned out of revenge Eventually, one of those kids, Víctor Alberto Delgado Mallarino, became the Director of National Police.

335,La Siberia,"La Calera, Colombia","An abandoned company town and cement factory outside of Bogotá, now haunted by ghosts and scofflaws.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-siberia,"In the 20th century, Bogotá was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. The Colombian capital’s population increased at a staggering rate, from just 330,000 in 1938 to 5.5 million in 2000. That exponential growth was fueled by the rapid modernization of its infrastructure and economy—as well as an explosion of violence in rural areas that drove people to the city. For several years, Colombia had the tragic distinction of having the world’s highest number of internal refugees. As the city’s population swelled, it needed buildings and roads to match. Enter La Siberia, a company town and cement plant owned by the Samper company where, from 1933 to 1999, much of Bogotá was produced. Located about 12 miles outside the city, near the town of La Calera, the abandoned complex sits at about 9,000 feet above sea level, surrounded by the wilderness of the Chingaza páramo. At its peak, La Siberia produced 1,000 tons of cement daily. It was home to more than 80 families, and included a church, school, police station, and cemetery, all in the shadow of three enormous, cylindrical cement ovens. The factory was shut down in 1999 amid a nationwide economic crisis, following complaints from residents about pollution and the environmental impact of limestone mining. Today, it’s owned by a Mexican multinational and sits in a state of disrepair. The walls are covered in graffiti, the empty workers’ homes are crumbling, and the vegetation of the High Andes is gradually encroaching on the site, reclaiming the pocket of industry once carved out by the limestone miners. Rumors of ghosts abound: Priests have done exorcisms, a journalist reported hearing a children’s choir, and many more visitors have seen lights in windows or mysterious figures on the move. Groups of bogotano youth once made a habit of heading to the site at nighttime to search for spirits, make art, and throw spooky parties; today, the owner employs a full-time watchman to ward off ghost-hunters and mischief-makers.  The road approaching the plant is unpaved and may be impassable after heavy rain. The plant is private property, but you can see it from the road.",company town mining ghosts factories industrial ghost towns abandoned history

337,Puente de Boyacá,"Ventaquemada, Colombia",This small bridge serves as a symbol of South America's independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/puente-de-boyaca,"The Puente de Boyacá is a small, fairly unassuming bridge that spans the narrow Teatinos River, not far from the city of Tunja in central Colombia. Now a symbol of South America’s struggle for independence, it was once a pivotal feature during the decisive Battle of Boyacá in 1819. On August 7, 1819, forces fighting for the independence of New Granada (corresponding to modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela), met in battle with forces loyal to the Spanish monarchy. Both armies were heading for Bogotá, which at the time lay lightly defended. At stake was control of the capital, and potentially the dream of an independent South America. The two armies clashed in a place known as Casa de Teja, where a bridge crossed over the Teatinos River. Leading the rebel army of about 3,000 men were the great liberator Simón Bolívar and Colombian hero Francisco de Paula Santander. Santander cut off the Spanish vanguard near the Puente de Boyacá, while Bolívar’s troops attacked the main force half a mile away. It was a resounding victory for the rebels, who captured some 1,800 prisoners including the Spanish commander. Bolívar went on to capture Bogotá three days later, an act that saw him hailed as the liberator of New Granada. The original bridge over the Teatinos was destroyed some time after the battle, but was rebuilt in 1939. Around the same time, the Puente de Boyacá was declared a National Monument and memorial to the War for Independence. Since then, a number of secondary monuments, some far more elaborate than the bridge, have been built around the Puente de Boyacá. These include a large statue of Simón Bolívar (known as the Von Miller Monument, after its German sculptor), a statue of Santander, the Flags Square, an obelisk on the top of the hill, and a Triumphal Arch. The latter depicts the three main races that formed the Colombian ethnic mix (Caucasian, African and indigenous). Some of these monuments, and the bridge itself, are in need of restoration, plans for which were being made as of August 2018.  Any bus running between Bogotá and Tunja can drop you off or pick you up from the road just near the Puente de Boyacá (some of the surrounding monuments are located on the other side of the road).

Donated by a cement company to advertise cement construction, it became Colombia’s first fully cement structure as a 1:1 replica of the Petit Trianon belvedere in Versaille. However more than just a Parisian replicate, the folly became a symbol that marked the arrival and development of electricity in Bogotá as it housed a small power plant which illuminated several important landmarks of the city, like the Plaza de Bolívar and nearby public parks. Besides being the last remnant of the celebrations which marked the centennial of Colombia being an independent country, the kiosk has served many functional purposes as an exhibition venue for the arts, a satellite Athenaeum for the National Library, and since 1993, a visitor’s center for those wishing to learn more about the history, culture and recreation of the city.

339,La Gaitana Monument,"Neiva, Colombia",This dramatic monument in Colombia honors a little-known indigenous fighter for independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-gaitana,"Adjacent to the “Museo Prehistórico” of Neiva, Colombia lies a giant monument on a public plaza. Although not a single sign at the monument provides information about its meaning, a deeper look reveals a historical significance so powerful that it warrants the construction of such a large structure. Built in 1974 by sculptor Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt, the monument stands atop three yellow pillars with a dramatic scene unfolding on top. It was originally constructed as a political symbol in honor of Gaitana, an indigenous member of the Yalcón Tribe of Colombia’s Upper Magdalena Valley. Gaitana is known among the local indigenous community for organizing 6,000 Yalcón people in the 1500s to rise up against Pedro de Añasco, the brutal Spanish conquistador ruling over the Yalcón at the time. When Añasco burned Gaitama’s son alive, she responded by successfully leading her people to independence. As punishment, she tore Añasco’s eyes out of their sockets and dragged him from town to town by a noose until he died. After learning of Gaitama’s story, Betancourt constructed the La Gaitama Monument in Neiva, a city nearby former Yalcón lands, to connect this little-known piece of history to the larger issue of anti-colonialism. The monument depicts Spanish conquistadors in a battle with the natives, with an eagle-masked Yalcón firing arrows at two Spanish horses and a centaur knight. At the center of the monument lies Añasco, with a cross, a shield, and empty eye sockets, being dragged by a rope by Gaitama. To show Gaitama’s contrasting personalities, Betancourt sculpted her to have a compassionate motherly face yet a powerful dress with a jaguar at the bottom. While La Gaitana Monument is little-known worldwide, the scale and beauty of it shows the immense meaning it has to the Yalcón.",colonialism monuments sculptures
340,Column of the Freedom of the Slaves,"Ocaña, Colombia",Colombia’s only monument erected to mark the end of slavery in the former Republic of New Granada.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/column-of-the-freedom-of-the-slaves,"It was May 21, 1851, when the Republic of New Granada (present-day Colombia and Panama) declared that slavery was to be abolished. The proclamation was met with a wave of support from most levels of society; however, the decision did not come into effect until January 1, 1852. To commemorate the end of human slavery in the republic, Agustín Nuñez, the then-governor of the Ocaña Province, wanted to perpetuate this historical moment with a physical memorial. Eventually, it was decided to build a victory column with five concentric rings. Each represents a Bolivarian republic and its individual commitment to eradicating the use of enslaved laborers and servants. The monument was completed on December 22, 1852, after only 15 days of construction. Nuñez sought to inaugurate this memorial within the first year of slavery being banned in New Granada so it could also serve as a standing timepiece and testament to this important moment in Latin America’s history and fight for social equality. To this day, the victory column remains the nation’s only monument commemorating the end of slavery. For this reason, and 150 years after its construction, the Ministry of Culture of Colombia declared the monument a heritage site of cultural interest, guaranteeing its conservation.  The monument can be found within the 29 de Mayo Plaza in front of the Santa Ana Cathedral. You can walk by it at any time.",slavery columns memorials monuments

The first and second parts of the museum handle with the premises of the first civilizations introducing various ceramic vessels with animal ornaments from San Jacinto and the Magdalena River area of Barranquilla, where the earliest evidence of settlements and agriculture on the continent were found. The museum tells the history of the pre-Hispanic civilizations located on the Colombian coast and introduces three main groups: The Taironas (builders and soldiers), the Zenues (goldworkers), and the Malibues (sailors and merchants). Their stories are told through a large collection of objects from daily life, including weapons, totems, pottery, vessels, and jewelry. Each group had its own specific expertise; You will then discover weapons and war tactics from the Taironas, vessels and gold jewelry from the Zenues, and jewelry made with shellfish from the Malibues.

342,Swing at the End of the World,"Banos, Ecuador",A swing to dangle you off the very edge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/swing-at-the-end-of-the-world,"Deep in the Ecuadorian wilderness is a seismic monitoring station in a tree, known as Casa del Arbol. Its location is 8530.184 feet (2,600 meters) above sea level and the purpose is to observe Mt. Tungurahua, the nearby active volcano, from its precarious perch. While the treehouse itself is a sight to behold, the real attraction is the swing hanging from one of the tree’s skinny branches. With only a lonely seat belt to hold you in, the swing arcs riders out into the air over the canyon. It is unclear where the swing came from—perhaps it was set up by a whimsical seismologist. The swing is part of a small park at Casa de Arbol, complete with three swings and a small zip line. Adventurous swingers of all ages are welcome to take a ride at the end of the world, but at their own discretion. Though the swing used to be completely unmonitored, today there are guides to help you buckle in and push you as you swing—and take your photo, of course. Well, it looks like the swing hangs over a cliff, it actually hangs over a steep slope so the experience is not as thrilling as the pictures show. Tour companies will offer you a shuttle between Baños and Casa de Arbol for as low as $5 each. They leave multiple times a day and are great if you prefer the ease of shuttles and you don’t mind long lines, limited time, and huge groups of people. You can also take a bus that leaves from the center of town and goes straight to the Casa de Arbol. It costs $2.50 and you’ll be waiting in far fewer lines at the swing.  When you pull up to the Casa de Arbol, you will immediately see a tree house with a swing at the top of a steep hill. This is not the Casa de Arbol, it is actually up a little trail and on the other side of the hill. But, this is a giant swing over a huge hill, and it’s cheaper than the Casa de Arbol (by $1) and has less lines. So by all means, give it a try if you like. The actual Casa de Arbol is to the right and up a short trail. Or, hike up the path to the Bellavista Cloud Forest Viewpoint from Baños (3-hour hike, less than 1 km). Casa de Arbol costs $2 to enter, which includes all three swings and the zip line. There is a small cafe on site as well with food and drinks for purchase.",ecuador swings retro-tech inventions
343,Laguna Quilotoa,Ecuador,A turquoise lake within a volcanic crater.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laguna-quilotoa,"When the Quilotoa volcano last erupted in 1280, it left behind a gaping caldera 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) across, which is now filled with brilliant turquoise water. The word “quilotoa” comes from the local Quechua language, a group native to the central Andes region. At an elevation of around 3,800 to 3,900 meters (12,467 to 12,795 feet), Ecuador’s Laguna Quilotoa is tucked within a rugged countryside, criss-crossed with well-worn hiking trails crawling all over the Andes mountain. The area is still home to many indigenous peoples, who make their living farming on the land much as they have for thousands of years. You’ll see their homes and patches of farmland dotting the hillsides and meet them on the trails nearby, usually wearing traditional Andean clothing and often herding sheep with a llama or two. The tiny town of Quilotoa sits nearby to the lake’s southwest, and is the best place to view the lake and begin the hike around its rim. The hike along the rim of the crater is about 7.5 km (4.7 miles), offering four or five hours of views down into the deep lake. Some of trails are suffering from erosion, especially those leading to the area at the base of the crater, where you can wander or even camp. But since the lake is only accessible by local buses and winding mountain roads, it remains less frequented than some of the region’s other spots. On some days, you might hike the caldera’s entire circumference and pass no one else—just a few wildflowers, and maybe a stray dog or sheep or, if you’re lucky, a llama or two. Quilotoa Lake is the beginning or end of a self-guided multi-day trek through the surrounding Andean mountain towns, often on poorly marked trails leading you into and out of rugged, deep canyons. The hike is an adventure and a challenge for any experiences hiker, but it’s not a backcountry trek: you can stay in local hostels and hotels every night as you hike, complete with a hot shower and a delicious meal for about $15 a night. Most people do the hike in 3-5 days, and follow the route from Latacunga > Sigchos > Isinlivi > Chugchilan > Quilotoa > Latacunga. The hike in this direction has a total of 2152 meters/7,060 feet of ascent and 1184 meters/3884 feet total of descent, across roughly 30 kilometers/18.6 miles. It costs $2 to enter the town of Quilotoa.If you just want to make a short visit, there are multiple buses each day from Latacunga to Quilotoa (1 hr 45 min). Take Zumbahua-Quilotoa-Chugchilan bus for $2.50. You will take this bus past a “Welcome to Quilotoa” sign. Don’t get off here. It’s not actually Quilotoa for a couple more kilometers. Once you approach a highway exit for Quilotoa, get off. The bus will continue left towards Chugchilan, but you will walk into town. Alternatively, you can make the three-hour direct drive from Quito. There's a wonderful hotel directly across from the entrance to the Quilotoa Lake called Hostal Chukirawa. Sitting at such a high altitude, altitude sickness prevention pills are recommended. Also, the town is foggy and cold - bring a warm jacket, and make sure that your hotel will be warm (such as a fireplace in your room and warm down blankets).",craters volcanoes lakes natural wonders water geology nature

It was during the 15th century that the Incan people arrived in the area that would come to be Ingapirca, but they found they were not alone. The area was already inhabited by the native Cañari who immediately came into conflict with the Incans. While the invading force soundly trounced the native peoples, they miraculously did not wipe them out. In sharp contrast to European colonization techniques, the Inca simply allowed their community to merge with the Cañari. This new hybrid community then grew into the city now known as Ingapirca. Among the interesting remainders of the merged culture are what seem to be two separate Temples of the Sun, each one catering to the beliefs of each culture. While the ruins at Ingapirca may not hold the same surviving grandeur as some other nearby ruins, their design and ingenuity is rich in information regarding how the Incan people lived. The largest structure still standing on the site is one of the aforementioned Temples of the Sun. While it is important from an architectural standpoint, the really interesting feature is that the temple appears to have been built at such an angle that the sun would have shone directly into the doorway during the solstices. This advanced design is also on display in the startling underground aqueduct system that supplied the whole community with water. The low lying ruins of Ingapirca are still being studied and continue to supply vital information on the lost civilization that seems to have been well ahead of its time.  There is a bus from Cuenca which departs at 9 am and takes two hours to reach the ruins. There you can do a 40 minute guided tour and return on the same bus at 1 pm.",temples archaeology ruins

In 1936, gardener Josè Maria Azael Franco, who worked as the caretaker of the city’s municipal cemetery, began sculpting the rows of bushes under his care into a variety of shapes and designs. There are the archways and angular geometric shapes that can be found in topiary collections around the world, but Franco also created a number of unique natural sculptures all his own. The garden features animals, angels, Incan symbols, and bulbous, iconic creatures squatting in a row. Franco passed away in 1985 and was fittingly buried at the cemetery, in the shadow of his life’s work. The topiary wonders live on to this day, cared for by Franco’s five sons, and the cemetery staff. Today the 3-acre graveyard features more than 100 creations, creating an immersive sculpted necropolis.

It’s not just the series of freshwater ponds on the grounds (one of which holds a 6-foot-long endangered Amazon fish that comes to the surface when you clap) that makes it unique. Or the soaring bamboo lookout that gazes over the humid forests. It’s the story behind Sinchi Warmi, which is run entirely by indigenous Kichwa women. The Amazon lodge was the brainchild of a group of women artisans who dreamed of running their own business to provide employment for their children and marginalized community. It was not an easy task. They fought hard against their macho peers who said the project would never amount to anything. It took 10 years to get the lodge off the ground, during which six of the women were abandoned by their husbands who were not pleased by their wives’ newfound independence. But they pushed on, learning how to create Facebook profiles and manage booking websites. And now, after a decade, the women have achieved their dream: a picture-perfect lodge that supports the community of San Pedro. Guests and passing visitors can enjoy a traditional guayusa tea ceremony, meet Saru the local monkey or one of her friends, or take a break in a breezy hammock overlooking the forest.

349,Middle of the World,"San Antonio de Pichincha, Ecuador",An elaborate shrine dedicated to the four corners of the world unfortunately misses its mark.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/middle-of-the-world,"The dramatic monument commemorating the 1739 French Geodesic Mission that surveyed the equator, established the circumference of the earth and the length of the meter, proved so ornate that relocating it 240 meters to the correct location would be more trouble than it’s worth. In 1936, geographer Luis Tufiño sponsored a 10-meter monument at the equator to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the French Geodesic Mission which charted the equator and measured the shape of the earth. The design of the monument seems inspired by a fictitious Incan pyramid imagined by the painter Frederic Edwin Church in the painting “Cayambe.” A larger monument of the same design was built on the site in 1979. A broad avenue lined with heroic busts of the members of the 1739 Geodesic Mission leads to a 30-meter tower topped by a 5-ton bronze globe balanced sideways on the line of the equator. The interior of the monument houses a small museum of Ecuadorian ethnography leading to an upper observation deck looking down on the valley and the little village of tourist attractions around the monument. The main attraction, however, is the painted line on the pavement marked Latitude 0° 0’ 0”, where all visitors take a photo straddling both hemispheres. Sadly, the painted line and the location of the monument are misplaced. The original calculations by Tufiño to establish the equator have been proven incorrect by more accurate modern technology and the actual equator line runs about 240 meters north of the monument. In addition, the French Geodesic Mission it commemorates did not actually visit this site on their survey expedition. Still, the monument remains a curious shrine to an imaginary line which brought Ecuador its name and worldwide fame.",location markers hoaxes hoaxes and pseudoscience geographic markers monuments

351,Tiputini Biodiversity Station,Ecuador,This research hub in the Amazon Rainforest is perched amid one of the world's most biologically diverse landscapes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tiputini-biodiversity-station,"Vibrant birds and chatty primates flit between the snarls of branches that form the higher canopies. Insects buzz through the air, while spiders weave their tapestries among branches or burrow beneath the soil. Larger animals, like giant anteaters, capybara, and tapir roam the ground. Even predators like the elusive black jaguar lurk just out of sight. From its perch along the shores of the Tiputini River, the Tiputini Biodiversity Station offers researchers an unparalleled place to conduct their studies of the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest. It’s located inside one of the most biologically diverse environments in South America, if not the world. The biodiversity station’s remote location, coupled with the lack of local large mammal hunting, make it a prime spot to view animals that typically can’t be seen elsewhere. An immeasurable number of creatures live in the area surrounding the station, though most will only become visible long enough for viewers to snag a fleeting glimpse. The nearby water also boasts a high volume of fascinating fauna. Pink dolphins, black caiman, stingray, and piranhas are but a small sample of the animals that live within the river, which streaks through the landscape like a muddy stain. The plants, too, are their own trove of diverse treasures. The Yasuni Biosphere Reserve has more than 1,500 species of flora per hectare. Many of the plants are medicinal, and have been used by indigenous healers and shamans for thousands of years. The station was established within the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve in 1995, as a joint project between the Universidad de San Francisco de Quito and Boston University.  Though it is primarily used by researchers, it also serves as an education center.  Groups of students or other visitors are welcome to stay at the remote station—in fact, 85 percent of its visitors are organized student groups. Those who do make the trek into the rainforest will find one main two-story research lab, a handful of secondary labs, and even a smattering of cabins containing bunk beds.",rainforest biodiversity ecology flora universities conservation trees plants animals
352,Cueva de los Tayos,Ecuador,"This cave system allegedly holds the ""metallic library"" of a lost ancient civilization.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cueva-de-los-tayos,"In 1976, a major expedition entered the Cueva de los Tayos in search of artificial tunnels, lost gold, strange sculptures, and a “metallic library,” supposedly left by a lost civilization aided by extraterrestrials. Among the group was the astronaut Neil Armstrong. For as long as anyone can remember, the indigenous Shuar people of Ecuador have been entering a vast cave system on the jungle-covered eastern foothills of the Andes. They descend, using ladders made of vines, through one of three vertiginous entrances, the largest of which is a 213-foot-deep (65-meter) shaft that leads into a network of tunnels and chambers stretching, as far as we know, for at least 2.85 miles. The largest chamber measures 295 feet by 787 feet. For the Shuar, these caves have long been a center for spiritual and ceremonial practices, home to powerful spirits as well as tarantulas, scorpions, spiders, and rainbow boas. They are also home to nocturnal oilbirds, known locally as tayos, hence the name of the cave. The tayos are a favored food of the Shuar, another reason why they brave the depths of the cave system. In their role as guardians of the cave system, the Shuar had been left in relative peace over the last century or two, apart from an occasional gold prospector snooping around in the 1950s and ‘60s. Until, that was, a certain Erich von Däniken decided to get involved. The Swiss author captured the global imagination in 1968 with the publication of his book Chariots of the Gods?, which is in large part responsible for the current plague of ancient astronaut theories and all that malarkey. Then, three years later, he published The Gold of the Gods, unleashing a little-known theory about the Cueva de los Tayos upon his eager readership. In The Gold of the Gods, von Däniken recounted the claims of János Juan Móricz, an explorer who claimed to have entered the caves in 1969. Inside the cave, he asserted, he had discovered a treasure trove of gold, strange artifacts and sculptures, and a “metallic library” containing lost information preserved on metal tablets. And the caves themselves were surely artificial, he claimed, created by some advanced intelligence now lost to history. This was red meat for von Däniken, of course, and tied in very nicely with his spate of lucrative books promoting his theories of lost civilizations, ancient astronauts, and the like (or, as Carl Sagan put it, von Däniken’s theory that “our ancestors were dummies”). It also inspired the first major scientific expedition to Cueva de los Tayos. The 1976 expedition was led by Stan Hall, a Scottish civil engineer who had read von Däniken’s work. It quickly grew to become one of the largest cave expeditions of its time, with more than 100 people involved. These included British and Ecuadorian government officials, leading scientists and speleologists, British special forces, professional cavers, and none other than astronaut Neil Armstrong, who served as the expedition’s Honorary President. The expedition was a success, at least in its less fanciful ambitions. The extensive network of caves was mapped far more thoroughly than ever before. Zoological and botanical findings were recorded. And archaeological discoveries were made. But no gold was found, no otherworldly artifacts discovered, and there was no sign of a metallic library. The cave system, too, appeared to be the result of natural forces rather than any kind of advanced engineering. Interest in the Cueva de los Tayos never again reached the heights of the 1976 expedition, but numerous research expeditions have since taken place. One of the more recent expeditions was that of Josh Gates and his team for the fourth season of the television series Expedition Unknown. Gates entered the cave system with Shuar guides and Eileen Hall, the daughter of the late Stan Hall from the 1976 expedition. And while expeditions such as these have resulted in fascinating zoological and geological discoveries, there’s still no sign of gold, aliens, or a library.  The Cueva de los Tayos is located in the rainforest about 23 miles southeast of the town of Santiago de Mendez in southeastern Ecuador, not far from the border with Peru. It is within the Sindical Center Coangos, and is therefore on Shuar territory. Access to the cave must be arranged with local Shuar authorities. Expeditions to the cave can be carried out on foot, by boat, or a combination of the two. It is sometimes also possible to go via helicopter from the town of Macas, some 50 miles north of the caves.",subterranean underground intriguing environs subterranean sites caves ecosystems
353,Isla de la Plata,Ecuador,This small uninhabited island offers Galapagos-like biodiversity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/isla-de-la-plata-ecuador,"The Galapagos Islands are an obvious destination for any explorer who’s wild about biological diversity. But for those who can’t afford to visit the famed epicenter of evolution evidence, there’s a smaller, cheaper option. Isla de la Plata (Silver Island) is an uninhabited island that’s part of Parque Nacional Machalilla. It’s about 25 miles off Puerto Lopez, Ecuador. The root of its name is uncertain: It may refer to the treasure allegedly buried there by Sir Francis Drake, or it may refer to the reservoir of guano (bird droppings) that glints in the sun from atop the cliffs. The two-square mile island is a hotbed of biological diversity. It’s packed with a plethora of birds, including different types of boobies, frigatebirds, tropicbirds, albatrosses, and pelicans. Honorable non-avian mentions include its many lizards, iguanas, turtles, crabs, and sea lions, all of which can be seen with relative ease. Upon setting foot on the island, most people experience the feeling of stepping onto another world, as curiosity prompts blue-footed boobies to wobble toward the human visitors. At arm’s length, the birds simply stare at people or dismissively pass by them. And just to dispel any doubt, no, “blue booby” is not a misnomer—their feet (and beak) are indeed blue! If you visit between June and September, you’ll likely see whales and dolphins popping out of the waves that ripple across the ocean separating the island from the mainland. Snorkeling will let you catch a peek of the fish and turtles that frequent the island’s coastal waters. GPS coordinates lead to the tourist information center.

354,Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús,"Quito, Ecuador",It took 160 years to complete the most ornate church in Ecuador.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iglesia-de-la-compania-de-jesus,"Jesuit architects began work on the Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús in 1605. The church was finally completed 160 years later, and is now considered one of the finest examples of Spanish Baroque architecture in South America. During the 16th century, religious orders were busy building churches in the newly founded city of Quito. The colonial city council had granted plots to the Franciscans, the Augustinians, and the Dominicans, among others. And when the first Jesuit priests arrived in Quito in 1586, they too sought land in the city on which to build a church. The Jesuits were granted a plot just off Plaza Grande in the heart of the city, and the first stone was laid in 1605 by the Italian Jesuit priest Nicolás Duran Mastrilli. And so began a 160-year construction project that would involve numerous architects, different architectural styles, and the work of some of Quito’s greatest artisans. Upon its completion in 1765, the Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús had incorporated four architectural styles. The predominant architectural style is Baroque, and the church has no shortage of the exuberance, fine detail, and grandeur associated with that particular style. Moorish, or Mudejar, architecture, meanwhile, is clear to see in the geometrical figures on the church’s pillars. Parts of the interior reveal the stucco decoration of the Churrigueresque style, while the Chapel of Saint Mariana de Jesús is very much Neoclassical. Today the church is widely regarded as the finest church in Quito and one of the most ornate religious buildings in Ecuador. The large central nave is decorated almost completely with gold leaf, gilded plaster, and wooden carvings, above which are two green and gold domes in the vaulted ceiling. Among all the architectural flourishes are 44 paintings and 56 sculptures by artists of the Quito School. The most famous of these works are the “16 Prophets” by Nicolás Javier de Goríbar, sculptures of the Holy Trinity by Bernardo de Legarda, and paintings depicting Hell and the Final Judgment at each side of the main entrance. Other notable elements include symbols of the Sun on the main door to the church and the ceiling. The inclusion of the Sun symbol was a nod to the Inca civilization (and the Sun God Inti), possibly included as a way of encouraging the indigenous population to enter the church. This syncretism is also displayed in other parts of the church. If you look carefully, you’ll see Ecuadorian plants and indigenous faces included within the decorations on the walls and pillars.  The Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús is located along García Moreno and Sucre in the historic center of Quito, one block to the southwest of Plaza Grande. Visiting hours for tourists are from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday and 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday.

It is a mix of natural wonder, culture, and archeology. The ancient Agua Blanca Community was among the last coastal community in Ecuador to succumb to colonization. As a result, many traditions and archeological findings are preserved. A set of temples, houses, and plazas typical of the Manteño culture, as well as archeological items and skulls, can be found on this site dating from 1500 BC. The community has a small church and a museum in the center of the village, and the church is wonderfully painted in bright colors. A small artisan’s market also sells rare Spondylus shell and tagua accessories, as well as local cuisine snacks. A natural sulfur lagoon can also be found on the site and is accessible by tourists. It is said the mineral waters and muds in the lagoon can help the skin and wellbeing of visitors. Howling monkeys, butterflies, hummingbirds, and local flora like ceibo trees can also be seen here, and a hiking tour to local haciendas is included as part of the visit experience. English-speaking guides can be requested. The Agua Blanca Community is located inside the Machalilla National Park in the province of Manabi, Ecuador.

But altitude junkies who want to go the extra mile (almost literally!) can head to the edge of the city, to the Teleférico. Step into one of this gondola’s six-person cars and you’ll be swept up another 3,600 feet along the eastern slope of the Pichincha Volcano. The base of the Teleférico—also known as the TelefériQo—was originally meant to be a commercial hub, surrounded by malls and restaurants. Most of these plans fell through, but the gondola itself is popular with both tourists and locals, who get a discounted rate. The walls of the cars are transparent, and as they zoom along, riders look down at hillsides dotted with wildflowers and grazing cows or watch their fellow daredevils enjoying themselves at Vulqano Park. A panoramic view of Quito unfolds farther below. Once the gondola has reached the top, it’s possible to climb even higher: a hiking path leads up to the volcano’s summit, and other Andean mountains rise up all around. Or you can take a break at the snack shop, which offers food, coffee, restrooms, and flavored oxygen—another kind of high.  The Teleférico's base is a 15-minute walk from the nearest bus stop. It's also accessible via car or taxi. Keep your ticket, as you'll need it to get back down. Those who aren't used to being up so high can suffer from altitude sickness—and even if you've been in Quito for a while, this is a major change.

357,Vilcabamba,"Vilcabamba, Ecuador","In this pristine Ecuadorian hippie town, residents remain active well into their eighties and nineties.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vilcabamba,"Snuggled in the hills of the Andean slopes of Ecuador lies a small oasis of vitality. Vilcabamba, known as the “Valley of Longevity,” enjoyed a spell in the limelight during the 1970s, when reports emerged that an astonishing number of centenarians lived in the area, giving the small town its nickname. According to the research conducted in 1971 by Dr Alexander Leaf of Harvard Medical School, there were nine residents who claimed to be over 100 years old, in a population of 819, a stunning figure. As this report circulated, researchers and tourists alike flocked to the village to understand the secret of their longevity. But this legend was punctured a few years later, when Dr Leaf himself went back to do some followup research and discovered that inaccurate self-reporting and misleading birth certificates had contributed to errors in the previous findings. There were no centenarians, and the oldest man was 96 years old. Despite the bursting of this bubble, the town continues to be known for its quality of life and its New Age, hippie-esque, health conscious vibe. Ever since the period of the Incas, the pristine mountain region has been a sought-after location for rest and recuperation. The royals would travel to the valley and recharge their batteries with the fresh water and mountain air, mineral-rich food, and a consistent spring-like climate. The combination of these factors are thought to help people live full and active lives well into their eighties and nineties. The simple pastoral life includes a lot of outdoor activity and exercise, and there are plenty of paths and hikes leading into the surrounding mountains. The scenes around town provide you with glimpses of able elderly people still working or enjoying their retirement, youthful hippies seeking an alternative lifestyle, and foreigners who have settled there after their retirement or fled there for a brief break from the stressful world outside. Because of the town’s reputation and the healthy lifestyle of the locals, vegan and vegetarian restaurants make up a large portion of the town’s businesses. Many newer structures have been built and the older ones modernized, but the town continues to hold on to its roots—letting nature flourish in and around the village, as well as within the bodies of many of its residents.",health medicine mountains nature

There are images of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary alongside messages designed to uplift on the walls. The only thing missing is the people. The infamous 140-year-old prison, converted to a museum after it was shut down in 2014, has changed little since then. It now offers visitors a glimpse of the less-picturesque side of Ecuador. From corrupt politicians and escapees to a con man who once posed as the son of the Costa Rican president, the squalid cells have been home to many dramas and colorful characters. On the 2-hour tour through the facility’s dirty rooms, the museum guides—many of them former guards—run you through the highlights. There was the time General Eloy Alfaro, the former president of Ecuador and revolutionary hero, who was dragged from his cell and burned in a nearby park. Or the incident in 2003, when 16 people escaped through a 25-meter tunnel. Serial killer Juan Fernando Hermosa, a 15-year-old kid who killed 22 men, spent time at Garcia Moreno, as did Daniel Camargo Barbosa, a notorious Colombian murderer. The facility is located in the San Roque neighborhood in the south of Quito, an area where sex work, drugs, and crime deter most tourists, though the museum does see plenty of curious visitors come through its doors. Garcia Moreno was shut down due to rampant overcrowding in 2014, and its 2,000 incarcerated people were transferred to prisons across the country. The tour ends with photos from one of the new facilities in Latacunga.

359,Post Office Bay,Ecuador,"Since the 1700s, this old barrel has acted as a post box that relies on the kindness of travelers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/post-office-bay,"Located on Floreana Island in the Galapagos, Post Office Bay has been acting as a sort of passive post station since the 1700s, using nothing but a barrel and the camaraderie of sailors and travelers. The site was established by whalers in the 18th century. As whaling ships headed out from England and the United States to hunt the gentle giants of the sea, they would use the Galapagos Islands as a stop-off to refill on food and water. They often feasted on endangered giant tortoises, eventually eliminating them from some of the islands. The hunting trips were long and the lonely sailors wished they had a way to send messages back home. So a barrel was placed on Floreana Island where whalers on their way out could put letters. The letters would then be picked up and delivered by sailors returning home from their trips. There was no postage fee, simply the trust that whoever grabbed your letter would get it to where it needed to go. Surprisingly the mailbox and its honor system are still in use today. While the letters are no longer the missives of lonely sailors just trying to get messages to their loved ones any way they could, thousands of letters still pass through the barrel each year. Nowadays the postcards and letters are generally left and delivered by hopeful tourists, but many still seem to make it to their destination. As described in an article in the Washington Post, groups of visitors (often tour groups or cruise patrons) will stop by the barrel and pull out the available mail, hollering out destinations to see if any of them are near enough to deliver. After the existing mail has been divvied up, people then leave notes and letters of their own for future visitors to take. Today the site is surrounded by debris and driftwood, much of it covered in stickers and graffiti.

According to local legend, the world will end if construction of the basilica is ever officially completed. In 1883, Father Julio Matovelle began drumming up support for the construction of a massive basilica in the heart of Quito, Ecuador. The president threw his weight behind the project, and Congress designated 12,000 pesos for its creation. Still, it was a slow process. Pope Leo XIII approved the construction in 1887, and the French architect Emilio Tarlier was brought in to design the church. Tarlier, inspired by the Notre Dame and Bourges cathedrals, began his designs in 1890. Finally, on July 10, 1892, the first stone was placed. It took more than 30 years to build the basilica. The first mass and the first ringing of the bells took place in 1924. Pope John Paul II blessed the church in 1985, and it was consecrated and finally inaugurated in 1988. With more than a century between its conception and inauguration, you’d expect the Basílica del Voto Nacional to be an impressive structure indeed. And it doesn’t disappoint. The church is 460 feet long and 115 feet wide, with its two frontal towers reaching a height of 377 feet. The interior features one long central nave with two smaller adjoining naves, with a dome and stained glass windows. Around the central nave are 24 small chapels, each dedicated to a province of Ecuador. A crypt and a pantheon are also connected to the basilica. Outside, meanwhile, is a series of gargoyles that might look more familiar than the fantastical grotesques that normally adorn the facades of churches and cathedrals. The gargoyles of the Basílica del Voto Nacional all represent animals endemic to Ecuador, including iguanas, tortoises, armadillos. and condors. Technically speaking, the Basílica del Voto Nacional has never been completed, at least not officially. According to local legend, this permanent state of incompletion is due to a fairly weighty premise: if the basilica is ever completed, the world will come to an end.  The Basílica del Voto Nacional is located on the corner of Venezuela and Carchi in central Quito, seven blocks northeast of Plaza de la Independencia. It’s open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday, and from 6 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekends. The entrance fee is $2 or $3 USD.

For such a small statue, it has inspired an impressive degree of devotion, and innumerable replicas both big and small. While commonly referred to as La Virgen de Quito, the statue goes by various names. Some call it the Virgen de Legarda (Legarda’s Virgin), in reference to the Ecuadorian sculptor and painter Bernardo de Legarda, a preeminent figure in the Quito School of Art. In 1732, Legarda was commissioned to create a sculpture of the Immaculate Conception for the Church of San Francisco in Quito. He presented his finished work in 1734: a 12-inch-tall wooden sculpture of the Virgin Mary, which instantly met with great approval for its beauty. The Franciscans were so inspired by the piece that they placed it in a prominent position above the main altar. Other names given to La Virgen de Quito refer to its form, albeit in varying ways. When people call it the Virgen del Apocalipsis (Virgin of the Apocalypse), they are referring to the Woman of the Apocalypse described in Chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation, a winged female figure often identified as the Virgin Mary. Legarda’s sculpture was inspired by this text, his winged Virgin stamping upon a snake, a representation the dragon/Devil figure described in the Book of Revelation. People also call the statue La Virgen Alada (the Winged Virgin), in reference to the small wings that appear above her shoulders. Another common name for the sculpture is the Virgen Bailarina (the Dancing Virgin). Unlike many sculptures of the Virgin Mary, which have a static appearance in comparison, La Virgen de Quito almost appears to be dancing. The position of her hands and the folds of her dress give her a sense of motion, a sway that won the hearts of the Quito faithful. The popularity of Legarda’s sculpture soon led to the creation of numerous replicas, and countless smaller copies spread across Latin America. Other artists were inspired to create similar statues, some of which are now housed in museums across the globe, including the Ethnological Museum in Berlin and the Brooklyn Museum. None, however, are quite as large as the Virgen de El Panecillo, a statue in Quito based on Legarda’s original 12-inch sculpture, but supersized to a towering 98 feet.

It is home to a world class collection of art, artifacts, and more than 20 displays that illustrate the variety of Ecuador’s geographic regions. But for many visitors, the main draw is the museum’s collection of shrunken heads from the Shuar people of Amazonia. Historically, in some indigenous cultures, part of a boy’s transition into manhood required that he kill an enemy and make a trophy of his skull, scalp, ears, or—in the case of the Shuar—the hide and hair from the entire head. The process of shrinking a head into a necklace-sized pendant, known as tsantsa, was unique to the Shaur. After killing and decapitating the enemy, the eyelids and lips were sewn or pinned shut to prevent the spirit from escaping. The skull was removed and replaced with a wooden ball to retain the shape. The head was then boiled in a special herbal tea to reduce it to the size of a man’s fist. After boiling, the head was dried with hot rocks and sand and polished with charcoal ash. These days, young Shaur making the transition from adolescence into adulthood are encouraged to hunt sloths and shrink their heads—a legal and more socially sustainable substitute. Outside the museum building is a four hectare complex that includes the foundations for a former Incan military post, an archeological and ethnobotanical park with over 300 plant species, and a bird rescue center which includes species such as macaws, parrots, and eagles.

In other words, it is agricultural sustainability at its best, as human activities do not harm, but benefit the ecosystem. Needless to say, this requires longitudinal research, along with a deep understanding of all the elements in the system and how these interact and influence one another. This is not so much a farm to visit, but a farm to experience. Making chocolate or cheese is an interesting project, but at Rio Muchacho the work goes deeper, as you collect cacao fruit from the tree and milk the cow for the milk, and along the way, all sorts of useful information is shared by staff about how to plant and when to harvest the cacao tree, or what kind of adventures the cow has been through. It’s educational, but also grounded in the everyday reality of a farming community, where the line between useful information and amusing anecdotes is blurred. Among the mind-blowing range of topics you can investigate from a theoretical and practical level are soil regeneration, moisture preservation, mulch gardening, biodynamic gardening, liquid fertilizers, composting, bocashi, organic pesticides, gray water systems, and the importance of moon phases in agriculture. All animals on the farm, including guinea pigs, serve a purpose, in the sense that all species produce manure with a specific chemical makeup. Fertilizing gardens means optimizing the plants’ output, but also feeding the soil so that the plant does not deplete its useful chemical elements. And, of course, the phase of the moon matters in fertilizing as well.

365,Museo Franciscano del Padre Almeida,"Quito, Ecuador","This overlooked, beautiful convent hides an original Hieronymus Bosch among its many treasures.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-franciscano-del-padre-almeida-convento-de-san-diego,"Located in an untouristed part of Quito, Ecuador, far off the beaten path, this 17th-century Franciscan convent is an overlooked highlight among the city’s museums. Once you pay the $3 entry fee and are led inside, you’re taken on a fascinating tour of the many gems hiding in this remarkable little convent-museum. The Museo Franciscano del Padre Almeida (Franciscan Museum of Father Almeida) at the Convento de San Diego is packed with beautiful art, walls adorned recently discovered frescoes that were long hidden beneath a layer of plaster, and exposed original beams up to 400 years old, held together with nothing but ancient vines. Among the incredible works of art, one standout is an original painting by the famed Dutch Renaissance artist Hieronymus Bosch. Titled “A Passage from this Life to Eternity,” the painting has hung in the convent for hundreds of years, though no one can quite explain how it got there. Also be sure to catch Ecuadorian painter Miguel de Santiago’s amazing depiction of the Last Supper featuring a cuy, or guinea pig. The tour includes a trip through a tiny stairwell up onto the roof, where you’re greeted by some beautiful city views. You’re also escorted behind the gilded altar to a 300-pound solid stone door that you have to crawl through to access a hidden ossuary chamber. Therein is a pit some 65 feet deep, nearly full with skeletal bones that have been stashed there over the centuries.  Take a cab or hired car. If you are nice to the guide and show genuine interest they may let you take photos, but the general rule is no photos.

366,Wall of Tears,Ecuador,Building this tragically pointless stone barrier cost the lives of the prisoners made to build it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wall-of-tears,"On the otherwise picturesque Galapagos Island of Isabela, the appropriately named Wall of Tears is an ugly and completely pointless barrier made of sharp volcanic slag standing as a monument to the prisoners who were forced to build it and those that are said to have died in the effort. In the mid-20th century remote Isabela Island was home to a bleak penal colony that stood in stark contrast to the Galapagos’ natural beauty. As punishment for their crimes, the prisoners who were sent to Isabela were forced to begin building a wall, ostensibly the first in what would eventually become their own permanent prison building. The forced laborers would have to chisel heavy, irregular pieces of volcanic rock from a quarry site a long walk away and lug the sharp stones back to the build site by hand. The wall reaches up to 65 feet and runs over 300 feet long and its construction was dangerous work in the ill-equipped conditions resulting in the deaths of a number of prisoners from both sickness and calamity. Today it seems clear that the construction of the wall was simply a form of punishment through labor, its purpose being nothing more than to cause misery. It still stands all alone on Isabela island, blocking nothing from anything. Visitors can actually walk up to the top of the wall and get an idea of how high it is and how easy it would have been to fall off with a little wooziness from the tropical sun. The penal colony on the island is long gone, but the memory of the cruelty inflicted there lives on.",walls prisons islands
367,Virgen de El Panecillo,"Quito, Ecuador",The world's tallest aluminum statue is also the world's tallest image of a winged Virgin Mary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/virgen-de-el-panecillo,"The Virgen de El Panecillo stands on a hill in the center of Quito, visible from almost everywhere in the city. Not only is it the tallest aluminum statue in the world, it’s also the world’s tallest winged representation of the Virgin Mary. In the 1950s, local authorities and religious leaders stood looking at El Panecillo, a loaf-shaped, 656-foot-high (200 meters) hill that rises up between central and southern Quito. They all agreed that the bare hilltop, visible throughout the city, was the perfect place to erect a statue. After years of staring at the hill and arguing about what exactly to put on it, they finally agreed on a concept. The statue would be a far larger replica of the Virgin of Quito, also known as the Virgin of the Apocalypse, Winged Virgin of Quito, or the Dancing Virgin, a 12-inch-tall wooden sculpture created by Bernardo de Legarda in 1734. This much-loved statue was a jewel of the Quito School of Art, and venerated by the city’s faithful. The plan was formalized in 1969, and construction of the concrete base began in 1971. The base alone took three years to complete, largely due to financial setbacks caused by the expensive volcanic stone cladding chosen to cover the concrete. For the statue, the committee turned to the Spanish sculptor Agustín de la Herrán Matorras. He looked at the 12-inch-tall Virgin of Quito, and then he went big. From his studio in Madrid, he designed and built a 98-foot-tall replica of the winged Virgin, using 7,400 pieces of aluminum, with each piece clearly numbered. The statue was then disassembled, shipped to Ecuador, and pieced back together on top of the concrete base. The statue was inaugurated in 1975. With a total height of 135 feet (41 meters) including the base, it was and still is the highest statue in Ecuador and one of the highest in South America—taller than Christ the Redeemer in Brazil. It also ranks as the tallest aluminum statue in the world, and the largest winged statue of the Virgin Mary. Apart from the wings, other notable elements are the globe upon which the Virgin stands and the snake that she is treading on. As if that wasn’t impressive enough, this Virgin also appeared in a movie alongside Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe. During the beautifully shot end credits of Proof of Life (spoiler alert for the clip), viewers are taken on an aerial journey over Quito accompanied by Van Morrison’s “I’ll Be Your Lover, Too.” After flying over a few famous landmarks, the camera circles around the Virgen de El Panecillo, lingering on her face as Van the Man sings “You’ll be my queen…” before the shot fades into the mist and emerges above a river valley in the Ecuadorian jungle.  The Virgen de El Panecillo is located on top of El Panecillo Hill between central and southern Quito. The road that runs up to the statue is called Gral Melchor Aymerich. There’s a small museum inside the base of the statue, and narrow stairs that lead up to some viewing areas. On a clear day the views are amazing. The statue is open to visitors from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Wednesday, and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday to Sunday. The entrance fee is $1 US.",world's tallest christianity statues museums
368,Calle García Moreno,"Quito, Ecuador",This historic street in Quito is known for its seven stone crosses—and one presidential assassination.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/calle-garcia-moreno,"Calle García Moreno is one of the oldest streets in Quito. Following the route of what was once a sacred Inca path, it is now known by two names: one referring to the Catholic crosses built along the street, and the other to the president assassinated on it. The initial urban development of colonial Quito (founded in 1534) posed a few problems for the Spanish conquistadors. Crisscrossed by creeks and ravines, and with a range of different elevations, it wasn’t easy for the Spanish town planners to lay out the classic grid plan that defines so many colonial towns and cities in the Americas. To create a semblance of order, they filled in many ravines. Along these ravines ran a sacred Inca path, connecting two temples: Yavirag, dedicated to Inti (the Inca sun god) and located atop El Panecillo Hill to the south of the city center, and Hunacauri, dedicated to Mama Quilla (the Inca goddess of the moon) on the hill of San Juan to the north. Once the filling-in was complete, the Spanish created one of the city’s first streets along the old sacred route. And, as they were prone to do, they soon started building Catholic churches along its course to better convert the indigenous population. By the end of the 16th century, some of the churches and chapels had erected stone crosses in the street to serve as public altars during the popular Corpus Christi celebrations each year. The crosses also served as a constant reminder to the city’s Spanish, mestizo, and indigenous faithful to not forget their religion as they ate—and often drank—in the cantinas and bars of the well-trodden street. Seven stone crosses were erected in total, and the street became known as Calle de las Siete Cruces (Street of the Seven Crosses), a name that can still be seen on street signs to this day. Officially, however, the street was renamed Calle García Moreno at the end of the 19th century in honor of the Ecuadorian president who was assassinated along its route. The piously conservative García Moreno had served as president of Ecuador twice in the latter half of the 19th century. He was a tough man, some would say a dictator, and he had his enemies. Liberals hated Moreno, both for his policies and his use of secret police to silence dissenting voices. Groups such as the Freemasons also had him in their sights, as he had outlawed secret societies of all forms. He made Catholicism the state religion and the only legal faith in Ecuador, and gave power to the church the likes of which it never had before, or has since. The third time García Moreno was elected, in 1875, even he seemed to know his days were numbered. He sent a letter to the pope asking for his blessing and protection before his inauguration day. In it he wrote: “Now that the Masonic Lodges of the neighboring countries, instigated by Germany, are vomiting against me all sorts of atrocious insults and horrible calumnies, now that the Lodges are secretly arranging for my assassination, I have more need than ever of the divine protection so that I may live and die in defense of our holy religion and the beloved republic which I am called once more to rule.” In the end, an appeal for divine protection wasn’t enough to keep Moreno out of harm’s way. On August 6, 1875, Faustino Rayo attacked the president on the steps of the Palacio de Carondelet, on Calle de las Siete Cruces. He struck the president with several blows from his machete, after which three or four of his co-assassins fired their revolvers upon the stricken president. Despite being a man who inspired more fear than love, the street was nevertheless renamed in honor of the murdered president, and has to this day borne the name of García Moreno. A plaque on the walls of the Palacio de Carondelet marks the spot where he was murdered—just one of many interesting details along Calle García Moreno, apart from the seven crosses.  Calle García Moreno runs for just under a mile through the historic center of Quito, between Julio Matovelle in the San Juan neighborhood to the north and Ambato in the San Roque neighborhood to the south. The crosses are found, from north to south, at the Iglesia de Santa Bárbara, La Concepción, La Catedral, El Sagrario, La Compañía, the Iglesia de El Carmen Alto, and finally the Hospital Psiquiátrico San Lázaro. Roughly at its midpoint, the street passes along one side of the Plaza Grande.",street names crosses assassination colonialism roads history

This remarkable urban space boasts a wonderfully diverse collection of activities spread out over its 165 acres, all within the heart of the city. Among the park’s attractions are the gorgeous botanical gardens, a small lake, a children’s library, an auditorium, playgrounds, bike paths, a skatepark, tennis courts, numerous food stalls, and yes, even a defunct 1940s Douglas DC-6 Ecuadorian Air Force plane turned into a printmaking museum. (What city park would be complete without one?) Although it receives upwards of 50,000 visitors a weekend, the park never feels too crowded, as there are plenty of activities to keep visitors occupied. If you have a lazy afternoon to spend in Ecuador’s capital, there’s something bound to pique your curiosity at this wonderful urban park.

Not many people know that the so-called Panama straw hat actually originated in Ecuador. The misnomer is dates back to the era when Ecuador began exporting the hats through the Panama Canal and foreigners erroneously assumed the hats came from Panama. Cuenca, Ecuador is the hometown of Homero Ortega (1916-1998), who started making the straw hats at an early age and passed down his trade to future generations who continue to manage the store, museum, and the label today. The museum features displays on the history of the iconic chapeau, the traditional manufacturing process, and the company itself.  Also, because the traditional workplace is the home, the hat factory, showroom, and museum all resemble a house, both inside and out. Homero Ortega first opened its doors to the public in the 1970s, thanks to Homero Ortega’s wife, Isabel Salamea Delgado, who wanted to connect with the people who were actually wearing their hats. Today, the line has since branched out to include specially woven handbags and purses as well, but it’s the Panama hat (sorry, the toquilla straw hat) that continues to be a fashion staple the world over.",hats museums
371,Momia de Guano,"Guano, Ecuador","A mummified Spanish monk found in the walls of an Ecuadorian church, alongside a mummified mouse.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/momia-de-guano,"In 1949, an earthquake devastated the small town of Guano, Ecuador. As rescuers were searching through the rubble of the local church they made a bizarre discovery: a mummified body stashed in the walls, alongside a mummified mouse. The Momia de Guano (Guano Mummy), as it became known, was discovered in its coffin inside the crumbling walls of the old La Asunción Church, built some 500 years ago. After a series of tests and plenty of research, investigators concluded that the mummified remains were those of Fray Lázaro de la Cruz de Santofimia, a Franciscan monk from Spain who had dutifully looked after the church in the mid- to late-1500s. Upon his death at an estimated 55 to 60 years of age, he was buried within the church walls in what was likely a local tradition, allowing Fray Lázaro to care for his church even after his death. The body appears not to have been mummified intentionally, or at least not by any standard mummification process. Instead, lime thrown onto the body at the time of its burial helped to preserve the corpse and along with it a little mouse who was found in an equally preserved state next to the monk. It’s unknown whether there was any kind of meaning behind the presence of the mouse (a loyal pet, perhaps?), or if it just had the misfortune to curl up in a lime-filled coffin. Today the Guano Mummy lies in a hermetically sealed glass case inside the Museo Municipal de Guano. It’s a strange sight, partly because of its clothing, which makes it look more like someone’s mummified grandmother than a mummified Franciscan monk. Its head is covered with a purple headscarf; its body dressed in a long, white, jacket-like robe. According to museum guides, the headscarf was either put in place to keep the mouth from hanging open, or it was a local burial tradition. Also inside the museum, at least when it’s not “on tour,” is a life-sized replica of the mummy, which cost the local municipality $2,200. It serves as a stand-in for the real and far more fragile mummy at various exhibitions and educational viewings that occasionally take place throughout the Chimborazo Province of Ecuador. The mouse, unfortunately, has no such replica.",monks mummies animals
372,Cementerio de San Diego,"Quito, Ecuador",One of the most historic cemeteries in Quito is an eclectic mix of architectural styles and famous tombs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cementerio-de-san-diego,"The Cementerio de San Diego is the final resting place for many famous figures from Ecuador’s past, including presidents, poets and military leaders. It’s also an eclectic mix of funerary architecture and traditions, which have slowly changed over the past 150 years. The Cementerio de San Diego opened to the public in 1872, on land that had already seen its share of burials. Fifty years previously, fallen soldiers from the Battle of Pichincha – a turning point in Ecuador’s war of independence – had been buried here, the final resting place for some of the 600 men who died on both sides. Since its inauguration, the cemetery has become one of the most emblematic and historic burial grounds in the city. Among the famous names buried here are former presidents of the republic, including Gonzalo Córdova, Aurelio Mosquera and José María Velasco Ibarra, and the poet Jorge Carrera Andrade. The cemetery is also famous for its funerary architecture. Over the years, families of note have commissioned noteworthy architects to design their tombs. There are mausoleums by acclaimed Quito architects such as Pietro Capurro, Luis Mideros and Francisco Durini, built in various styles, including neoclassical, neo-gothic, baroque, neo-baroque and more. Sarcophagi and gravestones are also decorated in a wide range of styles, from neo-Byzantine to Art Nouveau and Art Deco. A stroll through the Cementerio de San Diego will also take you through various sections that display different burial traditions. Along with the stand-alone tombs of the wealthy are rows of niche walls in which more common folk are interred. There’s also a large, open space for small gravestones, all neatly arranged in rows, some parts of which are set aside for child burials. And in the midst of these gravestones stands the San Diego Chapel, built in 1935 by the German architect Father Pedro Brunning. The cemetery is very much a community space, and the houses of local residents look down upon the cemetery from the surrounding hillsides. And, like much of Quito, the cemetery lies under the watchful eye of the Virgen de El Panecillo, a winged statue of the Virgin Mary that stands on a nearby hill.  The Cementerio de San Diego is located in the San Roque neighborhood, less than a mile to the southwest of the Plaza Grande in the city center. It is open every day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Entrance is free.",
373,El Panecillo,"Quito, Ecuador",A short volcanic hill in Quito doubles as a stellar observation point of an iconic statue.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-panecillo,"The El Panecillo—which translates to “small piece of bread” in Spanish—is a small volcanic peak in central Quito. Originally called “Yavirac” by the indigenous people of Ecuador, the hill once housed a beautiful sun temple at its peak before being destroyed by Spanish conquistadores. Today, the hill is an ideal observation point for unbeatable views of Quito and a close up look of the Virgen del Panecillo, a majestic sculpture that stands tall above the city. In 1976, the artist Agustín de la Herrán Matorras was commissioned by the Oblates religious order to build a Madonna figurine. The sculpture—which now stands at over 45 meters in height—was engineered and erected by Anibal Lopez and inaugurated in March 1976 by Pablo Muñoz Vega, the 11th archbishop of Quito. This Virgin Mary statue is the first one that shows the Madonna in a state of movement, in a dance formation, and perhaps the only one with wings.  Native people suggest the statue to be symbolic of chaining evil away from good.  This city landmark spot is recommended as a guided tour for photo opportunities in Quito. According to a bronze placard affixed to the Virgin Mary monument on top of El Panecilla, the figure represents the Woman of the Apocalypse as in the Book of Revelation. The best time to go to El Panecillo is mid-morning (to avoid tourist crowds). One can also get ground transportation like Uber to the top, but be aware of spotty cellular service at the top of the hill. The hill and Virgin Mary statue area are open during regular business hours with a small fee to enter the grounds and viewing platforms.",
374,Corrales Marinos de Monkey Beach,"Canoa, Ecuador",These unusual stone structures are actually fish traps crafted by an ancient civilization.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/corrales-marinos-de-monkey-beach,"Just north of the town of Canoa, Ecuador is a development project called Monkey Beach. Local archeologists have recently taken notice of a series of semi-circular stone walls that jut out into the sea from the beaches, located just to the north and south of this development. At high tide, the walls are submerged, but as the tide goes out marine life gets stuck inside these man-made pens. Most of these traps measure a little over 20 meters in diameter. This system of pens allowed ancient pre-Columbian civilizations that once populated the region to easily capture fish and other marine animals. This formed the basis for a vast civilization of fishermen, farmers, and traders. Remnants of this ancient civilization litter the beaches in the form of broken shards of ceramics and pottery that can be seen during low tide. Today, Canoa is a quiet fishing/tourism village and no longer a center of coastal commerce and trade. However, on a continent known for its ancient civilizations, these giant, still functional fish traps offer a unique glimpse into an often overlooked part of Ecuador.  At low tide, the pools created by these ancient stone walls can be up to two meters deep. If you bring your snorkel gear, you can swim around and sometimes find fish, turtles, and all kinds of small sea creatures hiding amongst the rocks. To visit the pools, drive north up the highway from Canoa about three miles until you see the sign on the left for ""Monkey Beach."" There is a large gate and sometimes a security guard,  just tell him you want to see the location and you should be granted access. They might have you sign a slip of paper. From the gate, it's just over four miles down a high-quality dirt road until you arrive at a lookout over the ocean. Head down the hill then turn left and follow the steep road down to the beach. At the bottom, turn to the right and find a place to park. From there, you can walk the rest of the way up the beach and the pools.",ancient technology engineering history & culture
375,Iglesia de Balbanera,"Colta, Ecuador",Ecuador's first Catholic church was built by Spanish conquistadors in 1534.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iglesia-de-balbanera,"When traveling south along the Pan-American highway from Riobamba, you may notice a church at the side of the road that doesn’t really look like anything special. However, you’d be mistaken! Constructed in 1534, La Iglesia de Balbanera is one of the earliest examples of colonial architecture in South America and the first Catholic church in Ecuador. Though it has survived centuries of earthquakes, the church still stands and is still in use today. The building is a beautiful blend of European and indigenous techniques. It’s built in the Baroque style and was cobbled together with local rocks, volcanic rubble, and adobe. Although it appears to have a traditional colonial design from the outside, you can see some traditional Inca-style carvings in the stone of the main façade. Unlike European Catholic churches, the interior is plain and the only adornment is an altar to the Virgin of Balbanera, from the La Rioja region of Spain. Every October and November, hundreds of locals turn out to see the Virgin paraded around the town of Colta. At the back of the church, there’s a tiny room which is billed as a museum where you can see some dolls and children’s costumes.  The church is open every day from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday Mass is at 9:30 a.m., 12 p.m., and 4 p.m. Please be respectful of the fact this is a place of active worship. Afterward, check out the cool and traditional Ecuadorian market outside, where you’ll find vegetable ivory statues, hand painted gifts, and alpaca wool goods.

376,Palacio de Carondelet,"Quito, Ecuador","Ecuador’s historic seat of government has been quietly looted in recent decades, and no one knows how or by whom.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-de-carondelet,"The Palacio de Carondelet serves as the seat of government and official residence of the President of Ecuador. It’s a historic building, but many of the items inside are not original. Over the last few decades, the Palace has suffered from a consistent pattern of low-key looting, with the culprits yet unknown. The Palacio de Carondelet, also known as the Palacio Presidencial (Presidential Palace), is a reflection of the various administrations that have governed Ecuador, in part or in total, over the centuries. The original building on Quito’s Independence Square (a.k.a Plaza Grande) dates back to the 1740s and the Royal Audience of Quito, the colonial seat of power of the Spanish Crown in Ecuador. It was a rather ramshackle affair at first, pieced together from various buildings bought by the crown. Then, in 1799, Baron Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet was appointed as the new President of the Audience, a position he held until his death in 1807. Carondelet set about renovating various important buildings in the city center, including the Cathedral and the Palace. He hired the Spanish architect Antonio Garcia to restore and refurbish the Palace, and in 1803 it was officially completed: a renovated, unified Palace more befitting of its position as the seat of Spanish colonial power in the region. The days of the Royal Audience of Quito, however, were numbered. The Ecuadorian War of Independence began in 1820 and ended on May 24, 1822, when Spanish forces were defeated at the Battle of Pichincha. After the battle, Ecuador joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, which included modern-day Colombia, Venezuela and Panama. For a short while, the Palace served as the headquarters of the South Department of Gran Colombia, and on occasion hosted the great liberator Simón Bolívar. Bolivar was so impressed with the building that he officially renamed it after the man behind its restoration, and ever since it has been known as the Palacio de Carondelet. Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia in 1830, at which point the Palacio de Carondelet became the seat of government for the new Republic of Ecuador. Since then, the building has served as the workplace for every President of Ecuador, including interim presidents and the occasional dictator. The presidential residence is housed on the third floor, although presidents may choose whether to live in the luxurious colonial-style apartment or elsewhere. A handful of presidents have renovated the Palacio de Carondelet over the years, but despite that it has remained largely the same, architecturally speaking, since 1803. The furnishings, however, have had a tendency to disappear. When Rafael Correa became president in 2007, he opened up the Palacio de Carondelet as a public museum, to allow the public to see the interior and its decorations, as well as the various gifts presented to presidents over the years. To facilitate this work, President Correa brought in María del Carmen Molestina, an architect, researcher and former director of the Museum of the Central Bank of Ecuador. She cataloged the Palace’s antique furniture and other historic objects, as well as the numerous presidential gifts, and decided where best to exhibit all these artifacts. During this process, she also discovered that the Palacio de Carondelet had been consistently looted during the past few decades. According to her investigations, everything seemed to be in its correct place until the end of the presidency of León Febres Cordero in 1988, and potentially until the end of the presidency of Rodrigo Borja in 1992. And then, well, things just started to disappear. Molestina discovered that the looting was so extensive that most of the furniture and other objects on display in the Palace today are new, or at least recently aquired. She even found that the bronze fittings on furniture dating back to the presidency of Garcia Moreno in the 1860s had been replaced by copies made of gold-sprayed lead. So far, no one has been accused of the looting.  The Palacio de Carondelet is located on the northwestern side of Independence Square, also known as Plaza Grande. Guided tours of the museum are free and last for about 45 minutes. You must reserve your tour at least a day in advance. Reservations can be made at the information stand in the square, by calling 3827000 (extensions 7150 and 7103) or by emailing ucultural@presidencia.gob.ec.

377,Casa El Pacto,"Píllaro, Ecuador",The devil masks on display at this small museum are part of an annual festival that has been taking place for centuries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-el-pacto-ecuador,"A small house museum in Píllaro, Ecuador, pays homage to a centuries-old tradition in the High Andes. Every year, a festival known as Diablada de Píllaro takes over the quiet mountain town. During the first six days of the year, people dress in elaborate costumes and parade into the city’s narrow streets. The Diablada features various characters, but by far the fan favorite is the mischievous dancing devils in their elaborate hand-painted masks. During the parade, these costumed devils scare children in the dense crowds that fill Píllaro during the Diablada. The devils have a roguish streak and are often armed with chili peppers and alcohol that they pour into the mouths of unsuspecting spectators. Many of the community members who dress up as devils spend all year making their masks. Local mask-maker Italo Espín is one such artisan, and it’s his home that houses this small cultural museum, Casa El Pacto. While some Diablada parades use more modern costume pieces, Espín is dedicated to the traditional way of handmaking his devil masks. After using paper mache to craft the mask’s shape, he carefully paints each mask, then incorporates horns, teeth, and fur from animals such as deer, boars, and llamas. Espín founded Casa El Pacto to help visitors understand the history behind the Diablada and these costumed characters. While the origin of the festival is under some debate, the Diablada has always had a strong rebellious character. Historically, the devils in the annual parade were a way for Indigenous Ecuadorians to assert themselves and their right to be in Píllaro as wealthy European colonizers began moving into the region in the 16th century.  Casa El Pacto is open to the public by reservation. The museum has a Facebook page with a phone/Whatsapp number (+593 3-287-4722) and email (italocultura@hotmail.es).

378,Bodie Creek Suspension Bridge,Falkland Islands,An abandoned suspension bridge on the Falkland Islands is crumbling into the water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bodie-creek-suspension-bridge,"When this structure was first constructed, it was touted as the world’s southernmost suspension bridge. Now abandoned and unsafe to cross, it’s at risk of falling into the very creek it was built to cross. The Bodie Creek Suspension Bridge is just south of the Goose Green settlement on East Falkland. It was constructed in 1925 to make it easier for sheep farmers to shepherd their flocks to the village’s newly built shearing sheds. As there are no ironworks or engineering factories on the Falkland Islands, the bridge was ordered from David Rowell & Co of London at a cost of £2,281. The kit was then shipped from London to the Falkland Islands on the SS Ballena. Due to the Falkland Islands being so remote and having limited resources, it was mainly up to the local sheep farmers, plus a stonemason and engineer, to put the bridge together. During construction, the workforce only had access to two machines to help them: a cement mixer and a stone breaker. Everything else was done by hand. Construction started in 1924 and was completed in 1925. Once it opened, the locals would drive their carts and later, their Land Rovers, across the overpass. And of course, the local sheep farmers who helped build the bridge would also use it to move their animals. But sadly, the bridge’s infrastructure weakened over time.

379,Bertha's Beach,Falkland Islands,This remote stretch of sand is a penguin lover's paradise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berthas-beach,"This beach is named after the Bertha ship that wrecked on the beach, though the wreck is no longer visible. But a lost shipwreck isn’t its only draw. If you’re a keen birder, this stretch of sand is a must-see. Bertha’s Beach is classed as both an important bird area and a Ramsar Wetland site because of the various birds that call it home. Head to the beach, and you’ll likely spot penguins waddling around. A number of Gentoo penguin colonies live on the beach year-round. For about half the year, it’s also frequented by Magellanic penguins. In addition to the penguins, the beach is also home to South American terns, ruddy-headed geese, the endemic Falkland flightless steamer duck, and various other birds. Although not as reliable as the bird watching, you can often see both Commerson’s and Peale’s dolphins playing and hunting in the surf of the beach. Sometimes the dolphins come close to the shore and essentially surf in the shallows to catch fish before returning to the waves. Although rare, if you are very lucky, you may be able to see beaked, toothed, baleen, or killer whales swimming by. Additionally, various types of sea lions and seals often come ashore to bask on the beach. The majority of them are harmless, but the leopard seals have been known to bite people who get too close to them. The flora is just as interesting as the fauna. The beach is also home to over 80 types of plants, with five of them being endemic and the Dusen’s moonwort ferns being very rare.  Bertha's Beach is located on the Fitzroy Farm on the East Falkland island but express permission is given to visitors to access the beach via the various signs at the carpark.

380,The Shipwreck of Lady Elizabeth,Falkland Islands,This haunting ghost ship stands beached in the waters off the coast of the Falkland Islands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-shipwreck-of-lady-elizabeth-falkland-islands,"Called the “Lady Liz” by locals, this three-masted rusted iron barque drifted into Whalebone Cove in February, 1936, and has remained ever since. The Lady Elizabeth was launched from Sunderland, England, on June 4th, 1879. She was built to replace a prior Lady Elizabeth, which had sunk off the coast of Western Australia in 1878. The second Lady Elizabeth voyaged all around the world, hauling cargo successfully for over 30 years. On December 4th, 1912, the Lady Elizabeth left Vancouver with a shipment of lumber. She was headed for Mozambique. While sailing around Cape Horn, she encountered strong gales. The ship was damaged, much of the cargo lost, and four men were thrown overboard. While limping into Berkley Sound on her way to Port Stanley for repairs, she suffered extensive damage to her hull when she struck Uranae Rock, off Volunteer Point. Once reaching Port Stanley, she was declared unseaworthy and bought by the Falkland Island Company to be used as a floating timber warehouse. On February 17, 1936, a fierce storm battered the Lady Elizabeth. She broke free of her moorings, drifted into Whalebone Cove and was beached on a shallow sandbar. Over the years, she has been vandalized by opportunists who have stolen her wood and other valuables. Today, she still stands, corroded but proud. Her current owner, the Crown Receiver of Wrecks, has attempted to convert her into a floating museum, but the project has stalled due to lack of funding.",sailors shipwrecks ruins
381,Christ Church Cathedral,"Stanley, Falkland Islands",The southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world has whale bones standing in its yard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/christ-church-cathedral,"Consecrated in the town of Stanley in 1892, Christ Church Cathedral is one of the crown jewels of the Falkland Islands. The church that graces the capital also graces the nation’s paper money, and although it is one of the smallest Anglican churches in the world and simple by cathedral standards, it is one of the most beautiful buildings in the Falklands. Its modest frame and steeple may not be ornate or grandiose, but it does have some treasures inside, and an unusual monument in the yard. In 1933, an arch made of the giant jaw bones of two blue whales was erected in front of the church to observe a century of British rule. The British had claimed the territory in 1785, regardless of the French already laying claim a year earlier. Spain then bought it from the French, and evicted the Brits, only to decide they preferred what is now Argentina. In 1820, the shiny new nation of Argentina absorbed the islands, but in 1833, the British made a comeback, and the Falklands have been theirs ever since. The jaw bones were brought to Stanley from the South Shetland Islands in 1922, and used to create the arch that stands out against the church’s humble backdrop today. Inside the church, the interior is also basic; wooden pews, stained glass, and 55 hassocks sewn and designed to represent different aspects of the Falklands by local parishioners. However, among the normal odds and ends one finds in a small town church, there’s one item of particular interest–the Shackleton Banner. Sir Ernest Shackleton was an explorer who was invited by the British to come to the Falklands and make some economic proposals, and his advice was heeded with great success. Shackleton was a member of the Order of the Garter, the most prominent order of chivalry bestowed. Banners of the order are required to hang in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor, but Shackleton’s son bequeathed it to the Christ Church Cathedral. It’s the only banner of its kind on the entire continent of South America.",whales bones exploration geographic markers churches monuments sacred spaces animals
382,Boot Hill,Falkland Islands,An ever-growing field of footwear invites legends and more shoes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boot-hill,"While “Assorted Footwear Hill” doesn’t really have the same charm as “Boot Hill”, it would be a more accurate description of the assorted shoes on stakes that litter this Falkland Islands hilltop. This isn’t the only place empty shoes have mysteriously accumulated. Across the U.S., fanciful shoe trees have periodically popped up here and there. In the case of the shoes on the Danube, the empty vessels were left there to honor thousands executed on the riverbank during World War II. Boot Hill has a couple of explanations, but as it often is with these kinds of communal effort of weirdness, nothing is known for sure. Located between Port Stanley and the local airport, one of the explanations for Boot Hill is that retired employees posted at the airport leave a work boot behind on the hill as they move on. Another, slightly darker legend offers a story of a local man whose leg was blown off by forgotten landmines left by a tussle over the islands between the UK and Argentina. The injured man impaled his boot on the hill, and soon the staked boot was joined by a continuously growing number of sympathy shoes. Perhaps the most likable legend surrounding the hill’s collection of assorted footwear is that if you leave your own behind as your visit to the islands come to a close, you are meant to return.

383,Falkland Islands Totem Pole,"Stanley, Falkland Islands",Where British troops serving on the remote islands paid tribute to their faraway hometowns.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-falkland-islands-totem-pole,"Head to the Falkland Islands, and there’s a chance you may see a small reminder of your hometown, no matter how far away it is, thanks to the various travelers who’ve left their marks on this unusual “totem pole.” This quirky roadside attraction has been dubbed the Falkland Islands Totem Pole. It was initially started by British troops deployed to the Falklands to protect the islands from further aggression after the end of the Falklands War in 1982. The deployed troops made mockup signs with the name of their hometowns and their distances from the Falklands. They then attached their handiwork to an old power line pylon, forming an unusual, unplanned piece of outsider art. It’s a tradition that still carries on today. Since the soldiers first tacked their hometown tributes to the tower, a number of visitors to the islands have added their own contributions. Tourists on holiday and scientists passing through on their way to various Antarctic research sites have also added signs for their hometowns.  The pole is next to the road, so you can stop to view it at any time.",totem poles signs roadside attractions outsider art
384,Argentine Military Cemetery,Falkland Islands,A hilltop collection of crosses remembering the hundreds of Argentine troops who fell during the Falklands War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/argentine-military-cemetery,"Simple white crosses stand in neat rows atop this somber sliver of land. They mark the eternal resting places of more than 200 Argentine soldiers killed during the Falklands War. After the British reclaimed the Falkland Islands on June 14, 1982, many of the bodies of the fallen Argentine were left on the Falkland Islands in temporary graves rather than repatriated back to Argentina. Buenos Aires refused to let the British return the remains of these troops back to Argentina, claiming that they were already laid to rest in their homeland. Since they were unable to ship the dead soldiers back to Argentina, the British commissioned the creation of the Argentine Military Cemetery in December 1982. Upon completion of the Military Cemetery, the British gave the fallen Argentine troops a Christian burial with full military honors. The British Armed Forces did their best to identify the remains of each individual member of the Argentine military buried at the cemetery and mark their graves accordingly. That said, a small number of the graves display the message “Argentine Soldier Known Only By God” due to them being unidentified.

385,Blue Beach Military Cemetery,Falkland Islands,A small cemetery remembers the British troops who fell during the Falklands War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-beach-military-cemetery,"During the Falklands War, many of the British troops who died in battle were placed in temporary graves until the war was won and a permanent cemetery could be established. At the time, the tradition was that British troops killed in action would be buried as close as possible to the location where they fell, and a memorial would be constructed to remember them as soon as it was safe. When the Falklands War was over, many of the families of the British troops who lost their lives decided they would prefer their loved ones be transported back to the United Kingdom. The landing ship Sir Bedivere was tasked with the repatriation and returned 63 British troops and one civilian contractor back to the U.K. in November 1982. The British government then commissioned the construction of the Blue Beach Military Cemetery on the very location that 3 Commando Brigade chose as their headquarters after the initial beach landings at San Carlos during the war. The cemetery was completed and unveiled on April 10, 1983, along with a memorial. The site initially served as the final resting place for 13 of the British troops who fell during the conflict. Sadly, two years after the war ended, Army Air Corps Captain John Belt lost his life in an accidental helicopter crash in the Falkland Islands. His family chose to have him buried at Blue Beach Military Cemetery and it has been the final resting place of the 14 troops ever since.",helicopters graveyards war history memorials cemeteries military
386,"Lieutenant Colonel ""H"" Jones Memorial","Darwin, Falkland Islands",It marks the spot where the high-ranking British officer died during the Falklands War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lieutenant-colonel-h-jones-memorial,"Lieutenant Colonel Herbert “H” Jones is one of the highest-ranking British officers to be killed in action in recent times. He was the officer in command of the 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment during their deployment in support of the Falklands War, and led his troops in the Battle of Goose Green. While leading an attack in a heavily entrenched Argentinian position, his section quickly became pinned down by heavy machine guns and automatic rifle fire. In a desperate bid to save his men, he decided to lead a charge against the nearest Argentinian position and was unfortunately killed during the process. Various accounts of the battle agree that the charge Jones led helped turn the tide of the battle of Goose Green and hasten the British victory. Shortly after he was hit, the Argentinian unit in the battle surrendered, helping to drastically lower the number of troops injured or killed on both sides as well as secure the release of 112 civilians that the Argentinian troops had imprisoned. After he fell, Jones was initially placed in a war grave at Ajax Bay on May 30, 1982. After the war ended, his body was then exhumed and reburied at the British Cemetery of Blue Beach at San Carlos. This memorial marks the spot where he fell during the battle. Jones was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest possible award for British troops in the British honor system.

387,Shell Beach,Guyana,"A nesting ground for four of the world’s seven marine turtle species, most of which are endangered.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shell-beach-turtles,"Shell Beach stretches for about 90 miles along the Atlantic coast of Guyana, not far from the border with Venezuela. From March to August, four species of marine turtles, all of which are either vulnerable or endangered, come ashore to lay their eggs. Of the world’s seven remaining species of marine turtles, almost all have been pushed to endangered levels. Hunting, habitat loss, plastics pollution, climate change, and accidentally being caught in fishing nets continue to threaten the existence of these large and long-living creatures. Shell Beach, named after the shells that form its 90-mile extent, is a vital nesting ground for four of these marine turtle species. This in itself is a rare occurrence, as most of the world’s sea turtle nesting sites are visited by only one or two species. Each year between March and August, female leatherback, olive ridley, hawksbill, and green turtles come ashore to lay their eggs. Under cover of night, the females make their way up the beach, often to the very spot at which they were born. Each female then digs an egg chamber and fills it with around 100 eggs before covering it with sand. The hatchlings emerge around 45 to 70 days later, making a mad dash for the water. Between 15 and 40 years later, many of these same hatchlings will return to Shell Beach to continue the cycle. This cycle, however, is a fragile thing. Thankfully, the turtles and the wider marine environment of Shell Beach have a protector. In 2000, Dr. Peter Pritchard and Romeo De Freitas founded the Guyana Marine Turtle Conservation Society, a non-governmental conservation program that has worked tirelessly to protect the turtles of Shell Beach from hunting, habitat loss (by erosion and human activity), commercial fishing, and the pollution of the oceans. Trying to monitor a 90 mile stretch of beach, especially at night, is no simple task. But thanks to the work of the Guyana Marine Turtle Conservation Society, visitors can still make the long trip to Shell Beach to watch the turtles coming ashore and maybe catch the hatchlings as they make their first journey to the sea. Which, for nature lovers, is one of the world’s most spectacular events.  Shell Beach is located in the Barima-Waini Region in the northwest of Guyana. While the entire extend goes by the name Shell Beach, it consists of nine beach sections, most of which are unpopulated (the largest permanent human populations are found at Almond Beach and Gwennie Beach, each with about 150 to 180 residents). It can be quite a mission to visit Shell Beach, so most people arrange a multi-day tour from the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. These tours typically offer basic overnight accommodation, which normally involves camping on or near the beach, which is ideal for the nightly excursions to see the turtles. Remember that between March and August is the time to visit. Do not harass or in any way interact with the turtles. Maintain a safe distance from both the turtles and their nests.",turtles beaches animals
388,Kaieteur Falls,Guyana,"The world's widest single drop waterfall, and the two men who legend says went over its edge in a boat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaieteur-falls,"Ever wonder what it might feel like to be the last humans on earth, witnessing a river plummet off the edge of the world? It might look something like Kaieteur Falls. Deep within Guyana’s region of the Amazon Forest lies Kaieteur National Park, home to a gargantuan cataract sharing the park’s name. Rivaled by few in the world when taken into account its combined height and the sheer volume of water from the Potaru River flowing over its precipice at any given moment, Kaieteur Falls further distances itself from the crowd of most spectacular waterfalls in the world for its remoteness. Surrounded by pristine rainforest, simply reaching this wonder requires hiring a tour company that will charter a plane in order to even reach a trekking point that accesses the falls. A pair of similar legends further contribute to the Falls’ mystique. According to local Patoma Indian lore, chief Kai saved his people by paddling over the precipice in an act of self-sacrifice to the spirit Makonaima. The second version is slightly less altruistic, as relayed by geologist Charles Barrington Brown in his account from when he “discovered” the waterfall on an expedition in 1870; Brown was told by Amerindians that a despised old man was put in a boat by relatives eager to be rid of him, and unceremoniously pushed into the current, which lent the falls their current name translating to “old-man-fall.” So, should you find yourself in close enough proximity to Kaieteur Falls to become mesmerized by its waters, remember the two men who are said to have actually gone over them. You must hire a private tour company to charter a flight to fly into the small Kaieteur airstrip in the middle of the jungle. Several tour companies run flights to Kaieteur Falls several times per week. Depending on the weather and the season, only one or two operators may fly a day. Book ahead to ensure your spot on a flight, as most planes will hold a maximum of 8-10 passengers. The flight from Ogle Airport in Georgetown is approximately 90 minutes one way. Wear sturdy shoes to visit Kaieteur Falls, as there are uneven pathways to navigate between the three different lookouts. You will spend around 2 hours on the ground before flying back to Georgetown or onwards to another destination depending on your day tour package.",waterfalls national parks legends water
389,St. George's Cathedral,"Georgetown, Guyana",Georgetown’s most impressive building is also one of the tallest wooden churches in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-georges-cathedral,"St. George’s Cathedral isn’t all that lofty as churches go, but at 143-feet-tall and made entirely from wood—apart from its foundations—it ranks amongst the tallest wooden churches in the world. Apart from its notable wooden construction, St. George’s Cathedral is an important and much-loved landmark in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown for two reasons: most locals would agree that it’s the most impressive building in the capital, and anyone with an eye for history can see how the cathedral is a window into Guyana’s colonial past. With the continued expansion of the Anglican Church in what was then British Guiana, a series of churches were built in Georgetown. The first St. George’s Church was built in 1810, but was soon deemed too small for the congregation. A second church was completed in 1842 but, as the Archdeacon Jones later stated, it “began its existence with a broken back.” The clay-brick building was a structural disaster and was dismantled in 1877. For the third attempt, the renowned English architect Arthur Blomfield was called upon to draw up the plans, initially for a stone building with a central tower and two western towers. The committee in charge of the new church argued against the use of stone, however, both because of its expense and its weight. Instead, they emphasized that “woods of the country and no others were to be used.” So Blomfield kept largely to his original plans, including the central tower, the Latin cross formation of nave and septs, and his use of the Gothic style of architecture. But instead of stone, he built most of the church using greenheart wood from Guyana. Greenheart is one of the stiffest woods in the world, highly durable, rot resistant and resistant to most insect attacks. Despite its wooden structure, the new St. George’s was built to last. The cathedral was completed and consecrated on November 8, 1894. At the time, St. George’s Cathedral was the tallest wooden church in the world, its tower reaching a height of 143 feet. It held this record until 2003 when the 246-feet-tall Peri Monastery near Săpânţa in northern Romania was completed. The new St. George’s Cathedral was a success, and its grand interior, complete with Gothic arches, clustered columns and flying buttresses, soon began to fill with an array of donated pieces, which today reflect the history of the cathedral as well as the colonial past of Guyana. The beautifully carved Bishop’s Throne was given by a Mrs. Manget in commemoration of the Bishop’s Jubilee. The Diocese of Barbados gifted the brass lectern, shaped in the form of an eagle. From the Howell-Jones family, proprietors of the Houston Sugar Estate came the iron pulpit. Chinese Christians donated the sedilia, and other benefactors provided the great east windows and other stained glass windows. Even Queen Victoria showed her appreciation for the cathedral, donating the large chandelier that still hangs prominently in St. George’s.  St. George's Cathedral is located along a roundabout on North Road in Lacytown, Georgetown, a few blocks to the north-east of Stabroek Market. The cathedral has been undergoing a major restoration project since 2017, and works continue. Don’t be surprised if you see scaffolding covering at least one side of the cathedral, and more works inside.",
390,Fort Kyk-Over-Al,Guyana,"A brick arch is all that remains of this Dutch fort, once a focal point for colonial power struggles in Guyana.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-kykoveral,"All that remains of Fort Kyk-Over-Al is a small brick archway and some scattered foundations. But in its heyday, this small Dutch fort was an important center of colonial operations in the region, and a target for rival British forces. In 1616, Dutch colonists came to what is now Guyana to create a colonial stronghold in the region. They traveled from the coast up the Essequibo River and created a strategically-located trading post on a 1.5-acre island near the confluence of the Essequibo, Mazaruni and Cuyuni Rivers. Here, under the command of the Dutch captain Adrian Groenewegen (who had been sent by the Anglo-Dutch firm of Courteen and Company to establish a settlement in Essequibo) they built a small star-shaped fort. Armed with just a few guns, it was possibly one of the smallest forts ever built by the Dutch overseas. The new fort was initially named Fort ter Hoogen, after an influential Dutch businessman. But it was soon renamed in a more descriptive manner: Kyk-Over-Al, meaning “see over all,” in reference to the fort’s commanding views of the rivers. Groenewegen was particularly interested in exploration and trade, and was soon trading successfully with the indigenous population, with Kyk-Over-Al at the heart of these operations. In turn, however, Kyk-Over-Al became a tempting target for British colonial interests in the region. In 1665, Major John Scott was sent by the Governor of Barbados, Lord Willoughby, to invade the settlements in the Pomeroon and Essequibo. After seizing the settlement of Nova Zeelandia with his Carib allies, Scott pushed further up the Essequibo River and occupied Kyk-Over-Al with just 20 men. Scott was overstretched, however, and couldn’t hold the fort for long. The Dutch Commander of the colonial settlement of Berbice, Matthys Bergenaar, marched overland with a group of soldiers and retook Kyk-Over-Al. At the same time, a French force, allied with the Dutch, besieged the 50 English troops left at Nova Zeelandia and starved them into surrender, and they were soon after massacred by the Arawaks, who were allied with the French. Kyk-Over-Al was redeveloped after the British attacks and, by 1676, trade and local sugarcane plantations were once again thriving. But while the British had backed away, French privateers were becoming increasingly active along the Essequibo River in the early 18th century. They launched attacks on settlements and forts along the river in 1708 to 1712, but were either driven away or paid a ransom to leave. Despite standing strong for one hundred years, Fort Kyk-Over-Al was eventually abandoned. The small island had become overcrowded by 1716, and the decision was made to build a new fort on Fort Island, much closer to the mouth of the Essequibo River and the Atlantic Ocean. Kyk-Over-Al soon outlived its usefulness. It was completely abandoned in 1748 and nearly all of the buildings on the island were demolished. Some of the materials were used to build a sugar mill at Plantation Duyenenburg on the Essequibo River. Today, a single brick arch is all that remains of Fort Kyk-Over-Al. It was nonetheless declared a national monument in 1999 and is now managed by the National Trust of Guyana.  The ruins of Fort Kyk-Over-Al are located on a small island at the confluence of the Mazaruni and Cuyuni Rivers, about 47 miles southwest of Georgetown. The nearest town is Bartica on the left bank of the Essequibo River in Cuyuni-Mazaruni (Region 7), about two hours from Georgetown.",
391,Stabroek Market,"Georgetown, Guyana","The largest market in Guyana, designed and built by the Edge Moor Iron Company of Delaware.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stabroek-market,"Few places in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown are quite as hectic or historic as Stabroek Market. Built by the Edge Moor Iron Company of Delaware in 1880, the iron and steel structure is possibly the oldest building still in use in the city. The site on which Stabroek Market currently stands may well have been a marketplace for at least a century prior to the existing construction. Accounts exist of a marketplace at this location in 1792, where enslaved Africans sold their produce on Sundays. At that time Georgetown was under Dutch rule, and the city itself was known as Stabroek. In 1799, the English traveler Henry Bolingbroke described Stabroek Market as such: “There is a market place where the Negroes assemble to sell their truck such as fruits, vegetables, fowls and eggs and where hucksters expose for sale articles of European manufacture in addition to salt beef, pork, fish, cheese, pipes, tobacco and other articles.” It wasn’t until 1843, with the city under British rule and renamed Georgetown, that the location was officially recognized as a market. With this now clarified, the Town Council set about building a marketplace using local hardwoods. It was a fine structure by most accounts, but by 1870 it was deemed inadequate. A committee was formed to discuss plans for a new market, and by 1879 six plans had been submitted. The Edge Moor Iron Company of Delaware, USA, won the contract, with a structure estimated at a cost of $132,855 including freight and the erection of the building in the colony of British Guiana. Construction began on August 17, 1879 and the new market was completed and declared open on November 1, 1880. A report in the Royal Gazette described the inauguration: “The market was opened this morning without any ceremony what so ever, the only signs of festivity being the flags disposed about the buildings and on the stalls. In the course of the day however a band of music made its appearance and discoursed sweet strains of music to the intense satisfaction of the mob, which had gathered. Some ladies keeping their stalls forgot their dignified station so far as to indulge.” The Stabroek Market, then as now, covers an area of about 80,000 square feet (7,000 m2), making it the largest market in Guyana. The steel-framed structure is estimated to weigh about 635 tons. Above the main entrance to the market is a steel tower holding a four-dialed clock, which was ordered from the E. Howard Company of Boston, Massachusetts in 1880. The clock tower also houses an iron bell manufactured in Sheffield, England, which once struck every half hour. Currently, however, the clock is out of action, a source of much argument, especially in light of the $41,000 donated by the United States Embassy in Guyana in 2016, specifically for the restoration of the market’s iconic timepiece. The absence of a functioning clock has done nothing to diminish the market’s frenetic atmosphere. Stalls are often mixed in random fashion, selling everything from fresh produce to jewelry, electronics, books, shoes and live birds. At peak market hours it’s the busiest place in the city: a chaotic, colorful and clamorous space where crime is common, so keep a tight grip on your bag.  Stabroek Market is located along the Demerara River along Georgetown’s western flank. The market opens daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., but closes early every third Wednesday so the market can be cleaned. Safety is an issue in Stabroek Market and robberies are a daily occurrence, so don’t bring any valuables, keep a firm grip on your bag, and watch out for pickpockets.",
392,Demerara Harbour Bridge,"Georgetown, Guyana",The end appears to be nigh for the world's fourth-longest floating bridge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/demerara-harbour-bridge,"The Demerara Harbour Bridge spans the Demerara River about three miles south of the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. At the time of its construction, it was the longest floating bridge in the world. The bridge was commissioned on July 2, 1978. With the majority of Guyana’s population living in or around Georgetown, the bridge was a vital transportation link across the Demerara River, connecting the main part of the capital with West Bank Demerara. The bridge was funded by the British Government and was designed, manufactured, and erected by Thos Storey, a bridge construction company established in Stockport, England, in the 1930s. The bridge has 61 spans, with the whole thing kept afloat by 114 pontoons. At its high span, it has a vertical clearance of 26 feet (7.9 meters) and a horizontal clearance of 105 feet (32 meters), allowing small craft to pass at all times. To allow larger craft to pass, including bulk ore carriers, the bridge has a retractor span that retracts fully, leaving a horizontal clearance of 254 feet (77.4 meters). The bridge’s most impressive statistic is its length. Stretching for 6,074 feet (1,851 meters), it currently ranks as the fourth-longest floating bridge in the world. The top spot is currently held by the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge that carries Washington State Route 520 across Lake Washington from Seattle to its eastern suburbs. When it was built, the Demerara Harbour Bridge was only designed to last 10 years. Despite that seemingly meager lifespan, the bridge is still going strong. On average, about 14,000 vehicles pass over it each day. The future of the bridge, however, is uncertain. Since 2015, plans have been afoot to build a new bridge over the Demerara River. In 2017, it was officially announced that a new bridge will be built a mile or so north of the existing bridge, with a completion date of 2020. At the time, a feasibility study declared that the existing bridge “has long passed its technical lifetime.” The end could be nigh for the Demerara Harbour Bridge, unless some vocal supporters get their way. In July 2018, Minister of State Joseph Harmon argued that there was no reason to demolish the existing structure, saying “I see absolutely no sensible reason to decommission one, where you have another one. I will lend my voice to that chorus which says that we should keep both bridges.” He also called the bridge a “tangible heritage” to all Guyanese.  The Demerara Harbour Bridge crosses from Peter’s Hall to Meer Zorgen. It is a toll bridge, although traffic running west to east doesn't have to pay. The toll is $200 Guyanese dollars, which is about $1 USD. The bridge has an ongoing retraction schedule to allow large vessels to pass through.

On February 23, 1763, a slave revolt broke out in the Dutch colony of Berbice in what is now Guyana. At the time, the colony consisted of approximately 350 white colonists, 250 enslaved indigenous people, and almost 4,000 black enslaved people. Should a rebellion gain any traction, the colonial rulers would therefore find themselves in no small amount of trouble. And that’s exactly what happened. The uprising began on the Magdalenenberg Plantation, in protest of the inhumane treatment of the enslaved people by their colonial masters. The main house and outbuildings were torched, and the rebels moved on to one plantation after another, liberating other enslaved Africans who then joined the spreading rebellion. At the Lilienburg Plantation, a house enslaved person named Cuffy (variously Coffy, Kofi or Koffi) of West African origin joined the revolt. He became the leader of the rebellion, training the rebel forces to fight as a unit against the Dutch militia. He took the wife of the manager of Plantation Bearestyn as his wife, and soon declared himself Governor of Berbice. Despite taking control of Berbice, Cuffy and the rebellion were ultimately undone by internal conflict. Cuffy had selected a man named Akara as his deputy, but Akara was a more aggressive leader and disapproved of Cuffy’s attempts to establish a truce and make terms with the Dutch. Akara formed a group to oppose Cuffy, and when Cuffy lost he took his own life. About a year after the start of the rebellion, troops from neighboring French and British colonies arrived to assist the Dutch and the rebellion was defeated. Despite this defeat, Cuffy became a national hero of Guyana, and a symbol of the fight against colonial powers. In 1976, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Guyana’s independence, a statue of Cuffy was unveiled on the Square of the Revolution in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. The statue is officially called the 1763 Monument, but is often referred to as the Cuffy Monument. The statue, which stands at 15 feet tall and weighs two and a half tons, was designed by Guyanese sculptor Philip Moore and cast in England by the Morris Singer Foundry. The figure of Cuffy bears many symbols: his pouting mouth is a sign of defiance; the face on his chest is a symbolic breastplate giving protection in battle; and the horned faces on his thighs represent revolutionaries from Guyanese history, including Quamina from the Demerara rebellion of 1823. In his hands he holds a pig and a dog, each being throttled, the pig representing ignorance, and the dog covetousness and greed.  The 1763 Monument is located in the Square of the Revolution in the center of Georgetown, between Homestretch Avenue, Vlissingen Road and Hadfield Street.",
394,Statue of Queen Victoria,"Georgetown, Guyana","Though dynamited and defaced, the statue still stands outside the law courts in Georgetown, Guyana.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/statue-of-queen-victoria,"Outside the High Court in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown stands a stoic-looking statue of Queen Victoria. Since its unveiling in 1894, the controversial statue has been removed and returned, decapitated and defaced, but as of yet remains standing as a contentious symbol of Guyana’s colonial past. In 1887, the colonial rulers of what was then British Guiana commissioned a statue of Queen Victoria to mark her Golden Jubilee. Created by the English sculptor Henry Richard Hope-Pinker, the marble statue was unveiled in 1894 outside the High Court in Georgetown. The statue stood in relative peace for more than half a century. Then, in 1954, the statue became the target of anti-colonial protests stirred up by repressive measures taken by the Colonial Office. The statue was dynamited and its head and left hand were blown off. It was sent to England to be repaired, and returned to Georgetown. Guyana gained its independence in 1966 and became a Cooperative Republic in 1970, at which time the statue of Victoria was moved to a quiet corner of the capital’s botanical gardens. Then, in 1990, the city’s mayor decided to restore the statue and return it to its original location in front of the High Court. Many locals were surprised, and some were enraged. Calls for the removal of the statue continued throughout the following decades, but local authorities were not inclined to listen. Then, in June 2018, Queen Victoria suffered another attack, this time with red paint. Many condemned the act of vandalism, while others saw it as a justifiable move by anti-colonial activists. The person or persons who defaced the statue faced a fine of up to $20,000 or 12 months in prison, but were never caught. The statue, meanwhile, was restored. It still stands outside the High Court in Georgetown, but for how long remains to be seen.  The statue of Queen Victoria stands in front of the High Court in Georgetown, near the corner of Charlotte Street and King Street. It’s easy to see from the road.",royalty colonialism statues

But it just so happens that this magnificent Paraguayan waterfall is located just a few miles from the thundering Iguazu Falls, one of the most famous falls in South America. And so, this breathtaking cascade in Paraguay is mostly ignored by tourists who race to more famous waterfall parks in nearby Brazil and Argentina. While the waterfall is not quite as powerful and impressive as its neighbors, this watery wonder is a quiet, relaxed affair, free from the chaos of crowds. Saltos del Monday may be little-known globally, but for the pre-Hispanic Guarani natives, the local waterfall held mythological significance and served as an important meeting place. (More recently, the site was the setting of a B-list Paraguayan horror film well known among young locals.) At the small, wooded Saltos del Monday park, visitors can take short hikes through rare Atlantic Forest, picnic under towering trees, or descend steel steps to watch the chocolate-colored Monday River roar down vegetation-covered cliffs. Watch for unique birds called Great Dusky Swifts, as they swoop in and out of the waterfall—they make their nests behind the falling water to defend their young from jungle predators.  Admission to the park is 35,000 GS (about $6 USD) for foreigners. The park is open daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.",wildlife waterfalls natural wonders water nature

Accessible from the southern city of Encarnacion, the ruins lie about 45 minutes outside of the city by bus. The Reducción de Jesús was established in 1685, in a different location near the Monday river. It was relocated several times, and moved to this location in what is now Itapua in 1760. The Jesuits planned to build replica of the Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola in Italy at the site, which would have been one of the largest churches in the area at that time. But when the Jesuit order was expelled from Paraguay in 1767, the construction of the mission had not yet been completed, and so the semi-complete church fell into ruin. In 1993, the ruins of Jesús de Tavarangüe, together with la Santisima Trinidad, became a UNESCO World Heritage site and have become a popular tourist attraction for the country of Paraguay.",colonialism religion sacred spaces ruins architecture

Built in 1897, the mansion incorporated an odd mix of medieval styles and looks dramatically out of place in its tropical surroundings. This eccentricity was intentional. After building their unusual estate, the Palmerola Ayala family quickly opened the castle for public balls and parties, which helped cement their social status and reputation. In 1956, the family donated the estate to the Catholic Church and the complex was transformed into a convent. Nuns replaced well-dressed revellers and a chapel was added to the gardens. Today, visitors can roam the well-manicured grounds and wander rooms filled with early 19th-century furniture, art, and oddities, including a grotesque display of taxidermized pets.

Antonio Martínez Sáenz purchased the home in 1772, and used bamboo and palm wood to fortify the mud walls and thatched roof, a common building technique that’s still used in many rural parts of the region. At the time, the house had no other purpose than to provide a place for Sáenz and his wife, Petrona Caballero de Bazán, to bring up their children. It was their children, Pedro Pablo and Sebastián Antonio, that placed this house at the center of a political process that would revolutionize the history of Paraguay. Having inherited the house, the two brothers began hosting secret meetings with various figures that contributed to the political upheaval in the country. Many notable fighters and conspirators participated in the clandestine meetings at the Casa de la Independencia, including Captain Pedro Juan Caballero, Captain Juan Bautista Rivarola, Lieutenant Mariano Recalte, and Fulgencio Yegros, all renowned Paraguayan patriots. Their efforts would lead to the proclamation of the Paraguayan Republic in 1813 and the declaration of independence in 1842. Nowadays, the building houses the Casa de la Independencia Museum. The furniture, artwork, weapons, and everyday tools on display are from the 1800s. Original documents related to the revolution and signed by patriots are kept in the office, one of the rooms in the museum. The building itself is one of the few remaining examples of colonial architecture in the city of Asunción.  The Casa de la Independencia is located at the intersection between streets 14 de Mayo and Presidente Franco.

399,La Santísima Trinidad de Paraná,"Trinidad, Paraguay","Of the many Jesuit missions in South America, this complex is one of the best preserved.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-santisima-trinidad-de-parana,"During the 17th and 18th century, Jesuit missionaries founded dozens of settlements in South America, especially in Paraguay, northern Argentina, and southern Brazil, in an effort to colonize the area and evangelize the locals. The expansion of European empires heightened interest in mission societies, who saw opportunity in newly colonized territories and their native peoples. Each of these missions would effectively function as a “state within a state,” remaining autonomous and isolated from Spanish and Portuguese rule. The result was self-contained societies in which Indigenous people and the European settlers lived together. Though the locals were not forced into living in the missions, they were expected to convert to Christianity. Paraguay contains some of the best-preserved and easily accessible examples of Jesuit missions, like La Santísima Trinidad de Paraná and the nearby Jesús de Tavarangüe, a reduction located in the south of the country, in the small town of Trinidad. This mission was one of the latest ones, being founded in 1706. It featured a large central plaza, a church, a school, a museum, several workshops, and houses. The Jesuits were expelled from Spanish colonies in 1768, and all the missions were abandoned. Many were looted by people searching for gold or other goods left behind by the missionaries. But la Santísima Trinidad de Paraná was mostly spared from destruction, along with the nearby mission of Jesús de Tavarangue.",indigenous christianity colonialism ruins
400,Machu Picchu: The Lost City of The Inca,"Aguas Calientes, Peru",The intricate stonework of Machu Picchu serves as a testament to Incan engineers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stonework-machu-picchu,"In Cusco, at 11,000 feet the mountain weather is kaleidoscopic, and the Inca tradition is palpably present. Cusco is every single thing that Santa Fe, New Mexico would like to be - magnificently Spanish colonial, profoundly Indian, filled with often brilliant crafts, and made entirely of real adobe. Just up the hill is the famed Sacsayhuaman complex of behemoth stones perfectly fitted together by Incan engineers. (A nice place to stay in Cusco is the Hotel Monasterio - a restored monastery now run by the Orient Express.) The train ride to Aguas Caliente is worth the trip all by itself. Surprisingly, Machu Picchu (at nearly 8,000 feet) itself is in fact lower than Cusco, and it’s northwestward, down into the Amazon jungle. As one travels along one sees the biomes change before their eyes. Along the whole way are spectacular rivers, especially the Urubamba, plunging white water without end for miles - it is so relentless and violent, that to this day it has never been kayaked. (When the train stops jump out for some hot corn on the cob offered by locals, with kernels seemingly as big as Inca stonework and purely delicious.) One is also reminded they are in the Andes. They dwarf all other mountain ranges. So godallmighty huge and steep and inviting and menacing and one marvel at the skill of the Inca and their predecessors, to imagine their mastering these mountains as they did. If we judge the Greeks and Romans highly because of the excellence of their architecture, what do we make of the Inca, who could be said to surpass them architecturally? In fact, the Inca surpasses everybody in their reverence for stone and water. At Machu Picchu sixteen stone waterfalls sequence down one side of the site. All over Machu Picchu massive crafted stones are fit together in near-perfect harmony and celebrate the sun, the year cycle, the surrounding mountain shapes, and the way humans take a step. Machu Picchu is among the greatest architectural achievements and cultural centers of the Incas and the Old World. It is so perfectly built that the structures are able to survive earthquakes, pretty common in Peru and specifically in Machu Picchu, as it was built on top of two fault lines. Since its discovery, the citadel has attracted millions of tourists, becoming the most visited attraction in Peru. Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.   As of 2017, stricter rules have been placed on visiting Machu Picchu in attempt to deal with the masses that visit every day. Visitors will not be allowed to enter without an authorized guide. Machu Picchu is limited to 2,500 tourists per day. There are already arrows to help control the flow of visitors but these will be more prominent. There are also changes to opening times for Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu/Wayna Picchu, and Cerro Machu Picchu. Entrance to Machu Picchu is split between a 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM entrance. Buses leave frequently from the small town of Aguas Callientes -- which in itself is a charming mountain community & very tourist trappy! The trip to the site is about 30 minutes on a road with 14 turns! You can also reach Machu Picchu by trekking the Inca trails, there are few options like the classic trail, one-day trail, and the Mollepata trail all of them reach to the Machu Picchu and take four, one and five days respectively. All of them provide an amazing and rewarding trekking experience. Alternatively, you can hike solo to Machu Picchu via Hidroelektrika. It takes 2.5 hours, one way, to reach Aguas Calientes from Hidroelektrika. Trail is straightforward; you just follow the train tracks. Make sure to get the 7am van from Cusco to Hidroelektrika so you'll be at Aguas Calientes by 5pm. When going back to Hidroelektrika, leave by 11am so you'll catch the vans going back to Cusco at 2pm.Be sure to wear comfortable shoes or boots fit for hiking! Many of the steps in the site are stone & often uneven -- they can be hard on your feet & legs. If you do choose to trek the Inca Trail, make sure you bring a very warm sleeping bag as it can get incredibly cold at night.",lost tribes long now locations repositories of knowledge cultures and civilizations intriguing environs ecosystems ruins
401,Q'eswachaka Rope Bridge,Peru,"Keshwa chaca, among the last handwoven Incan bridges, crosses Apurimac Canyon in Peru.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/last-handwoven-bridge,"Known as Q’eswachaka (the first syllable is a lateral “click”), Queshuachaca or Keshwa Chaca, this is one of the only remaining examples of the Incan handwoven bridges once common in the Incan road system. Made of woven straw, the bridge spans 118 feet and hangs 60 feet above the canyon’s rushing river. The Incan women braided small, thin ropes, which were then braided again by the men into large support cables, much like a modern steel suspension bridge. Handwoven bridges have been part of the trail and roadway system for over 500 years, and were held in very high regard by the Inca. The punishment for tampering with such a bridge was death. Over time, however, the bridges decayed, or were removed, leaving this last testament to Incan engineering. The bridges’ sagging was addressed by destroying and rebuilding it in an annual ceremony—originally considered a social obligation under Inca rule, and now preserved as a way of honoring their history by the nearby community of Quehue, Peru. This bridge has been christened with a traditional Incan ceremonial bridge blessing and is in extremely good condition. Every June, Quechua communities gather on the banks of the Apurimac River to renovate the bridge. On this day, they manifest their honour to Pachamama, the Earth Mother, and behold archaic traditions. When the work is over, people express gratitude to Apus (mountain spirits) and afterward celebrate with music, traditional food and drinks  From Sicuani, follow signs to Arequipa (a left turn if you are on the main highway facing toward Cuzco). Continue on that road until you begin seeing signs for Quehue. From Quehue, continue through town to the west (probably best to ask directions from a local at this point). When you cross the Apurímac River on the steel roadway bridge, Q'eswachaka is on your right. There is one walkway down to it on either side of the roadway bridge (about 100 m away from the bridge in both cases).

They’re colored by the sediment and atmosphere of the area, unique because of its altitude and isolation close to the ocean. But none are quite so marvelous as Vinicunca, also known as Rainbow Mountain, Winikunka, Montaña de Colores, and Montaña de Siete Colores. For all its striking colors, Rainbow Mountain was notoriously hard to find. It’s located deep in the mountain range, and even the most adept travelers with highly experienced guides have reported difficulty locating it. In the past, it took about six days of hiking to reach its peak. Nowadays, there are plenty of bus tours departing from Cusco to the mountain. Due to the increase in popularity of the mountain, it has very quickly become Peru’s second most visited tourist site. During the peak season, it can see up to 4000 people per day. To be sure, those who love hiking will enjoy the journey; the Ausangate trek is one of the most popular among visitors to Peru. There are hot springs, local villages and vendors, stunning views of the Ausangate Glacier, and llamas and alpacas along the way. And nothing caps off almost a week of trekking like a visit to this breathtaking painted mountain.  There is now a road leading to the mountain. The trek to the summit can now be done in a couple of hours. While the hike is not long, the altitude can cause problems for those not used to it.

404,The Boiling River of the Amazon,"Puerto Inca, Peru",This scalding hot river was thought to be a myth until one geoscientist made it his quest to study the mystical waters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-boiling-river-of-the-amazon-puerto-inca-peru,"Hidden in the dense jungle of the Peruvian Amazon is a percolating, roiling river. The steaming turquoise waters that can reach up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit are guided by ivory-colored stones and guarded by 60-foot walls of lush forest and vegetation. Locals believed the river was sacred and that the hot waters held healing powers, and shamans incorporated it into medicines. As a child, Andrés Ruzo listened to his Peruvian grandfather tell the story of the Boiling River, or Shanay-timpishka, an ancient name loosely translating to “boiling with the heat of the sun.” The headwaters are marked with a boulder in the shape of a snake’s head. According to legend, a giant serpent spirit named Yacumama or “Mother of the Waters” who gives birth to hot and cold waters heats the river. For 12 years, Ruzo was skeptical that the river truly existed. Then, as he was creating a thermal map of Peru during his graduate studies at Southern Methodist University in Texas, he discovered an unusually large hot spot—one of the largest geothermal features found on any continent. In November 2011, he went on an expedition to central Peru with his aunt to see the Boiling River for himself. From the nearest city Pucallpa, the entire journey took about four hours, including a two-hour drive, 45-minute motorized canoe ride, and an hour hike along muddy jungle paths. The river is protected by the shaman of the small town Mayantuyacu, a secluded healing center. After getting special permission from the shaman to study the water, Ruzo was led by the shaman’s apprentice to the almost four-mile stretch of flowing, scalding water. The water temperature ranges from 120 degrees up to almost 200 degrees Fahrenheit, and reaches 16 feet deep in some places. The mud of the riverbank was too hot to walk on, and if you fell in your skin would be covered in third-degree burns in less than a second. Small unfortunate animals, like frogs, could be found floating dead and broiled in the water, the “eyes always seem to cook first turning milky white,” Ruzo wrote in National Geographic. Ruzo, wearing only sandals, carefully hopped between the small white rocks the size of paper to take samples of different areas of the river. He found that the water averages 187 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn’t quite boiling, but is still really hot, with steam emanating off the surface. The geothermal feature struck Ruzo as odd since it isn’t located near volcanic or magmatic activity. “Boiling rivers exist,” he wrote in National Geographic, “but they’re always near volcanoes.” A body of water the size of the Boiling River requires a heat source with a lot of energy, yet the closest active volcano is more than 400 miles away and there are no known magmatic systems in the Amazon jungle. After some investigating and testing different hypotheses, Ruzo and his research colleagues believe that a fault-led hydrothermal feature was causing the river to reach such temperatures. The water seeps deep into the earth, heats up underground, and resurfaces through faults and cracks. Since his initial visit to the Boiling River, the trip from Pucallpa has been reduced to a three-hour direct drive because of the rapid deforestation and commercialization of the area. To preserve the sacred river, Ruzo started the Boiling River Project to protect and study the natural wonder in a safe manner. Ruzo details his experience with the Boiling River in his book The Boiling River: Adventure and Discovery in the Amazon.

405,Nazca Lines,"Nazca, Peru",Giant ancient line art drawn in the Peruvian desert so large that it can only be fully seen from the sky.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nazca-lines-peru,"The Nazca Lines are legendary. Stretching across nearly 200 square miles of high arid plateau, these drawings of hundreds of figures range from giant spiders to vast geometric shapes, to enormous monkeys as large as 890 feet (roughly two and a half football fields). Hummingbirds, fish, sharks or orcas, llamas, and lizards—and, according to some, astronauts, aliens, and landing zones—are all depicted in these enormous line drawings. One of the most tantalizingly mysterious archeological sites, these geoglyphs have spawned wild theories about the ancient Peruvian peoples that made them. One significant reason there is so much interest in the drawings: they can only be fully seen from a few hundred feet in the air, meaning that the people who created them never would have had a way to see them in full… unless, of course, you believe they did. Due to the mystery surrounding their exact purpose and the fact that they can only be fully seen from the sky, the lines are of particular attraction to new-agers, ancient astronaut theorists, and alien enthusiasts — much to the frustration of the anthropologists, archaeologists, and astronomers who have studied the lines and hope to provide credible answers to their purpose and creation. The glyphs were made between 200 BC and 600 AD, the time of the technologically sophisticated Nazca people, who are believed to have created the lines. They were created by scraping a 10 to 30 cm layer of iron oxide off of the dry desert floor. Due to the incredible dryness and consistent weather of the area, this was all it took to create images that have lasted for well over 1,500 years. The lines were first systematically studied by the Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejia Xesspe in 1926, ever since it has been a mystery. The most likely construction method involves putting stakes in the ground, tying a rope between them, and scraping the dirt off along the rope. This would explain the geometric shape of many of the lines, as well as how the Nazca would have kept the measurements for the drawings in ratio to each other, by simply multiplying the measurements of a drawing into rope lengths. Wooden stakes found in the ground at the end of some lines support this theory of creation. But the real mystery comes not in the how, but the why. The explanation most in keeping with what is known about the Nazca culture is that the lines were made to be walked upon as a sort of ceremonial procession that led to a sacred area where the Nazca prayed to various gods involving agriculture and water. The shapes, then, were never meant to be seen at all, and it was only with the advent of modern aircraft that they were. Another viable suggestion is that the figures were intended to be seen by the gods; a sort of early SETI program to announce, “We are here! You, in the sky, are you out there?” Others believe that the lines were a giant astronomical calendar pointing to the locations where celestial bodies would align themselves. However, archaeoastronomists who examined the site in 2000 dismissed this claim as insufficiently supported. The wildest and least sensible theory—though certainly one of the most seductive and popular—involves ancient aliens who communicated with the ancient Peruvians and used the lines as navigational devices or even landing fields for some type of ancient astronaut. Yet another alternative explanation is that the Nazca did indeed have a way to see the drawings from the air: hot air balloons. Recently Jim Woodmann, a proponent of the Nazca hot-air balloon theory, managed to build one using only materials and techniques that the Nazca would have had available. Hot air balloonists argue that the Nazca were a technologically advanced society and point to their having built an impressive system of underground aqueducts, known as puquios, that still function today. However, there is no evidence besides the possibility that the Nazca ever built or had hot air balloons. Despite the figures having been examined by numerous anthropologists, ethnologists, and archaeologists, not to mention new-agers, ancient astronaut theorists, and alien enthusiasts, we may never truly know what the Nazca lines were meant for, or how the Nazca people intended them to be seen. What we do know, though, is that they are incredibly fascinating. The lines have seen some intrusion and damage over the years. When the Pan-American 1S Highway was constructed through the area, it transected the lines themselves. In 2014 Greenpeace activists walked across part of the plain to lay a banner message near the Hummingbird. By not wearing the special protective shoes used by researchers, they caused permanent damage to the soil.  In early 2018, a truck driver ran over the ancient lines, leaving tracks across 104-by-328-foot area of the site and causing damage to three of the geoglyphs. Now, the best way to see the Nazca Lines is to hop on a plane in one of the nearby cities (Nazca, Pisco, or Ica). The prices are about $100 + airport tax. Take a bus from either Lima (7 hours) or Arequipa (8 hours) to Nazca. Flights can be arranged by local tour agencies, or take any collectivo or bus heading north to get to the Mirador viewing tower 20 km north of town. Best flights over the lines are those before noon–the wind starts to pick up then and your flight can be bumpy!",seen from space astronauts geoglyphs lost tribes long now locations giant aliens astronomy mystery sacred spaces art

407,Ollantaytambo Ruins,"Ollantaytambo, Peru",Preserved Inca city and site of the last Inca stronghold against the Spanish conquistadors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ollantaytambo-ruins,"Dating back to the reign of 15th-century Emperor Pachacuti who conquered the region, the town of Ollantaytambo contains some of Peru’s best-preserved Inca ruins. Strategically located in the far western reaches of the Sacred Valley, around a 1.5-hour drive from Cusco, Ollantaytambo was home to the Inca elite of the time. Massive reconstruction efforts undertaken by Emperor Pachacuti following the destruction of the original town yielded the architecture and innovations that define the site today. The town’s primary attraction is the Ollantaytambo Fortress on the outskirts of the settlement in a section known as the Temple Hill. Though originally built for purposes of worship by Emperor Pachacuti, the fortress served as the last Inca stronghold against the Spanish Conquistadors and has the distinction of being the site of one of the only battles in which the Inca successfully repelled Spanish forces. Not far from the fortress is the Wall of the Six Monoliths, a towering section of wall composed of six large segments. Construction of the wall was abandoned before its completion for reasons that remain unknown. Other nearby attractions include the Temple of the Sun and the Princess Baths, both of which feature examples of Inca carvings. The town itself should not be undersold. A walk through the settlement provides an unparalleled glimpse into the lives of the town’s former inhabitants and offers visitors an intimate look at Ollantaytambo’s distinctive layout and dwellings. Noteworthy features include quarries, terraces, ceremonial grounds, and storehouses. The full Boleto Turistico del Cusco (130 soles or about US$36.50 per person) is valid for 10 days from the first time you use it. It includes admission to some museums in Cuzco, all of the archaeological sites around Cuzco, and the major archaeological sites in the Sacred Valley, including Ollantaytambo. If you do not plan to visit the archaeological sites or museums in and around Cusco and just want to focus on the archaeological sites in the Sacred Valley, get the partial Boleto Turistico (70 soles or about US$20 per person).

408,Huayllay National Sanctuary,"Casma District, Peru",A remarkable geological formation resembling a forest made of stone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/huayllay-national-sanctuary,"It doesn’t get much more remote than the bottom of the sea. 75 million years ago, that’s where the unique geological features of the Huayllay Stone Forest got their start. Some time has passed since then, but while the location of this rocky outcrop has changed relative to the seafloor, its fascinating features have only gotten more weird as glaciers scampered over it and torrential downpours and fierce winds tore through its many ruts and crevices. Jagged rock walls, naturally sculpted stone shards that pierce the topsoil from somewhere deep below, and impassibly disjointed plateaus are just a few of the unreal formations that can be experienced here and nowhere else. From a slight distance, it’s easy to see where the stone forest gets its name – the densely packed, tapering rocks literally appear to be a standing forest turned to stone. Prospective visitors will be happy to know that in the modern epoch, the Huayllay Stone Forest is well above sea level, and although still quite remote, also quite visitable with the right amount of gumption. Now part of a nature area designated and protected by the Peruvian national government under the umbrella title of Huayllay National Sanctuary, tourism has picked up by the smallest of increments, but the remote location still makes transportation and lodging hard to come by. Put it this way: adventurers looking for something a bit more rustic than Grand Canyon-like tourist areas can expect to have the vast nature preserve entirely to themselves, or at least nearly so. Word about this remarkable location has been slow to spread, and its most frequent visitors are still the Llamas and other protected wildlife that have inhabited it for thousands of years. The desolation and unbelievable geology of the Huayllay area can make it easy to imagine that you’re actually visiting an alien world, but one look at the prehistoric cave and rock paintings found in some areas of the park are a poignant reminder that you are, in fact, still on the same planet as the rest of us – even though you might have to look back thousands of years to find some evidence of human life.",martian landscapes geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems geology nature ruins
409,Chauchilla Cemetery,"Nazca, Peru","Plundered and left asunder by grave robbers, this ancient necropolis has been painstakingly pieced back together.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chauchilla-cemetery,"Since 1997, Peruvian law has protected the haunting Chauchilla Cemetery, a Nazca burial ground where mummified corpses were laid to rest until the ninth century. Prior to 1997, it was ravaged mercilessly by Peruvian grave robbers. For many of these ancient corpses, it was the second time they lost their heads. Scattered among the many full-bodied mummies at Chauchilla Cemetery are a number of mummified heads. Many of the heads have been specially prepared with holes drilled into the backs of their skulls, and in some cases, rope has been threaded through the mummified head. This is possibly so they could be worn as a necklace or as a jaunty charm hanging off of a belt. Though originally believed to be “trophy heads” taken in battles, recent evidence shows that the heads actually came from the same population as the rest of the mummies, suggesting the heads may not have been taken in battle after all. The exact nature and use of the heads remain distinctly unclear. Despite the fact that the burial grounds have not been utilized since the ninth century, the human remains are astoundingly well-preserved. The Peruvian Desert’s dry climate is, of course, a factor in the preservation, but burial practices also contributed to the condition of many of the corpses, some still hanging on to their hair and skin over 1200 years after their demise. Clothed in cotton and painted with resin, the deceased were placed in mud-bricked tombs. Wooden posts that were once assigned by archeologists to the category of religious use are now thought to be drying posts for the dead, which would explain the added step needed for such an impressive example of mummification. Discovered in the 1920s, the remains and artifacts were spread across the area, picked over by nefarious pilferers. The burial ground has been restored to as close to its original state as possible, with the bones, bodies, heads, and artifacts either returned to tombs or showcased in displays.  Awnings have been added to cover the tombs and prevent more sun damage.  Chauchilla Cemetery is located 28.5 km (17.7 mi) south-east of the city of Nazca. Take the 1S/Pan American Highway south out of Nazca to the Carretera a Chauchilla (a road) and follow it to the end. Tour information can be found on several Peruvian travel websites.

410,Gocta Waterfall,"Provincia de Bongará, Peru",One of the world's tallest waterfalls wasn't revealed to the world at large until 2006.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gocta,"In 2005, German economist Stefan Ziemendorff, who was working on a wastewater project in the Amazonas province of Peru, took a break from his work to go for a hike in Peru’s Utcabamba valley in search of one of the region’s abundant pre-Incan ruins. When he crossed into a blind ravine, he spied something unexpected: a towering, two-tiered waterfall in the distance that hadn’t appeared on any map. The following March, after he had returned to the site with measuring equipment, Ziemendorff held a press conference to declare to the public that he had discovered the third-tallest waterfall in the world. The two tiers combined, the water plummets 2,531 feet, the height of well over two Eiffel Towers. Of course, Ziemendorff’s “discovery” wasn’t actually a discovery at all. The residents of Cocachimba had known about the waterfall since the 1950s. Their town was located practically right beneath it. They knew it as “Gocta,” after the sound made by howler monkeys in the region. But they had mostly avoided the towering waterfall due to superstitions surrounding it. The natural wonder simply blended into the background of their daily life. The pronouncement that Gocta was the third-largest waterfall in the world was met with controversy. Depending on your measurement (Do the multiple tiers count as one waterfall? Where does the waterfall begin, since it is mostly on a slope?), the falls could be anywhere from the third to the sixteenth largest in the world. No one is doubting the impressive majesty of Gocta Falls though. The spike in international interest has benefited Cocachimba as well, which now plays host to the many tourists who come to witness the falls.",world's tallest waterfalls natural wonders water nature
411,Huacachina,"Ica, Peru",An unexpected desert oasis in South America.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/huacachina-oasis,"According to legend, a hunter caught a beautiful Incan princess walking in the sand dunes near present day Huacachina. As she walked and admired herself in a mirror she was carrying, her eyes caught his voyeuristic gaze. Shocked, the princess began to flee and dropped her mirror. It exploded into shards and the glass became a tiny pool in the desert, consuming the princess and turning her into a mermaid. Known as the “Oasis of America” it is one of the only true desert oases in the Americas. A lush island in a sea of sand, its watery pool ripples in shades of blue and green, completely encompassed by the brutal environment around it. Circled by palm trees, the verdant Peruvian watering hole has served as a tourist attraction for over 70 years. Dotted with restaurants and hotels, the Oasis was formerly a getaway for the upper class, escaping through the desert from nearby Ica. As of late, the small city, with a population of only 115, has become a hub of backpacking, dune buggy rides, and sandboarding, a sport aptly described by its name. In recent years, Huacachina has unfortunately begun to resemble the fleeing princess of its legendary origin. The water level of the oasis has dropped consistently, and the community has sustained it through pumping water from external sources. As budget concerns and restrictions on pumping have increased, the future of this South American oasis and legendary mermaid home remains unclear.

413,Huayna Picchu,"Aguas Calientes, Peru","If you’ve ever seen a picture of Machu Picchu, then you’ve seen a picture of Huayna Picchu—you just didn’t realize it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/huayna-picchu,"Machu Picchu is a mind-boggling feat of engineering and megalithic architecture, improbably situated atop a difficult-to-reach Andean mountain summit. But whoa, hold on, what the heck is THAT? Up there, on the even taller peak overlooking Machu Picchu? That, my friend, is Huayna Picchu. Sitting 2720 meters (8920 feet) above sea level, and 360 meters (1180 feet) above Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu was a sort of sacred suburb of the famous citadel of the Incas, consisting of temples and terraces that served as a residence for the high priest and “local virgins” (I know that sounds sketchy, but this was no doubt necessary for totally legitimate high priest business, like making sure the sun didn’t get stolen by a condor). The structures are set gingerly atop the conical peak or stuck to the steep mountainside, often ending in sudden, breathtakingly sheer drops. The site can be visited today via the original trail built by the Incas to facilitate travel between the main site and this astonishing satellite. The ascent is a hair-rising climb, at times slippery and/or fully exposed — here following stairs cut from the mountain itself, there requiring the sight-seer to clamber up on all fours. The way is reportedly manageable for any reasonably fit person, unless that reasonably fit person gets overwhelmingly terrified at the thought of stumbling off the side of a mountain. As if the whole thing is not already crazy enough, once you have visited the summit Huayna Picchu, you can proceed down the back side of the peak to check out the Temple of the Moon, which stands seemingly suspended on the sheer mountain face at the mouth of the Gran Caverna, another ritual site lined with typically exquisite Incan stonework that was most likely used to hold mummies. Access to Huayna Picchu is limited to 400 visitors per day, split into a 7:00am group and a 10:00am group. These controls were put in place to limit impact on the centuries-old trail, and to afford ample space for ongoing excavations at the top of the peak. The ascent takes around two hours, while the descent take 45 minutes to an hour — depending on how often you pause to stare, flabbergasted, at basically everything around you.  It is not possible to climb Huayna Picchu without a ticket for Machu Picchu. You need tickets for both. Walking sticks are not allowed, as they are prohibited throughout the whole Inca ruins. Also, don't bring big backpacks, as parts of the path lead through very narrow tunnels. There are nasty gnats inside Machu Picchu. Especially, on this long hike, it is recommended to bring bug repellant. As detailed above, there are two time slots each day. As Machu Picchu is often hidden in heavy mists in the morning, it is better to buy tickets for the 10:00 am group. The ruins down below will be most busy at noon as well, so you will avoid the crowds at the same time. As of 2017, stricter rules have been placed on visiting Machu Picchu to deal with the masses that visit every day. Visitors will not be allowed to enter without an authorized guide. There are already arrows to help control the flow of visitors but these will be more prominent. There are also changes to opening times for Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu/Wayna Picchu, and Cerro Machu Picchu. Additionally, to climb Huayna Picchu, there is an age limit of 12 years or older. The age limit is imposed as the previously mentioned trek has a lot of slippery stone steps up a steep trail that requires the use of all hands, and hair-raising drop-offs.",archaeology ruins
414,Moray,"Urubamba, Peru",Huge stone depressions which may have acted as an Incan agricultural experiment.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moray,"Grouped together in Peru’s lush Cuzco region, the ringed Incan ruins known as Moray have long been a mystery, but it is looking more and more likely that the nested stone rings may have been part of a large-scale agricultural experiment. Unlike a number of the elaborate metropolises and statuary left behind by the Incan people, the rings at Moray are relatively simple but may have actually been an ingenious series of test beds. Descending in grass-covered, terraced rings, these rings of rings vary in size, with the largest ending in a depth of 30 meters (98 feet) deep and 220 meters (722 feet) wide. Studies have shown that many of the terraces contain soil that must have been imported from other parts of the region. The temperature at the top of the pits varies from that at the bottom by as much as 15ºC, creating a series of micro-climates that — not coincidentally — match many of the varied conditions across the Incan empire, leading to the conclusion that the rings were used as a test bed to see what crops could grow where. This proto–America’s Test Kitchen is yet another example of the Incan ingenuity that makes them one of the most remarkable declined societies in the planet’s history. 5 kilometers west of the pueblo of Maras.

415,Salt Pans of Maras,"Maras, Peru",This Peruvian canyon is filled with geometric salt pools that have been being harvested since the Incan empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salt-pans-of-maras,"Fed by a small local stream, the field of angular, interlocking earthen evaporation pools near the small Peruvian town of Maras has been providing local inhabitants with salt and visitors with a stunning view for generations. Cascading down a hillside valley like uneven steps, the Salinas de Maras (as they are known in the local tongue) were first created sometime in the 1400s by the Incas. While there is no transcribed record of the ponds’ creation, they seem to have been passed down and expanded by a small number of owners over hundreds of years. Salt is harvested from the patchwork of shallow pools via a process of evaporation. A natural spring feeds a salt-rich stream that flows down into the pools, which are then opened and dammed individually as needed. Once one of the pools is filled, the water is allowed to evaporate, and then the salt crystals are scraped off the ground with simple instruments. Then the whole process begins again. The area is not widely industrialized, and the salt is still just bagged up, packaged, and sold at market. Today there are about 3,000 pools that are still harvested by the community of local families who control the salt pans, the transport roads to the valley, and generally the entire salt production from the site, which remains much the same as as it was when the Inca discovered it over 1,000 years ago.",salt food
416,Cahuachi,"Nazca, Peru",Nazca pilgrimage site covering 370 acres is a popular stop for archeologists and looters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-cahuachi,"Cahuachi was once one of the most important and largest ceremonial centers for the Nazca culture in Peru. Covering 0.6 sq. miles (1.5 square kilometers) and containing over 40 mounds providing a base to adobe structures, the area is thought to have been a pilgrimage site, its population ebbing and flowing in relation to ceremonial events. Italian archaeologist Giuseppe Orefici has been heading excavation and research of the site for several decades, and American archeologist Helaine Silverman has also studied the site extensively throughout the years. Their findings have supported the theories that this area was not the bustling capital of the state of Nazca as previously thought, but a place for people to gather in prayer. While it may have been a sacred place in ancient times, it now often falls prey to looters, who find the burial site rich with artifacts too tempting to ignore. Cahuachi overlooks some of the Nazca Lines, an intriguing archeological mystery that Orefici is sure Cahuachi holds the key to. Still delivering mummies, artifacts, jewelry and priceless information about the civilization from 1500 years ago, these seemingly plain ruins are a fascinating spot to tour in Peru, and provide a window into a mystical past still being uncovered.

While the site is thought to be the remains of a much larger fortress complex that once stood atop it, the remaining walls of the structure are an impressive reminder of the Incans’ almost unbelievable engineering skills. Over the three stepped sections of the remaining walls, huge stones of all sizes are stacked together like a Herculean game of Tetris. The stones are all carved into roughly square and rectangular shapes, but there is little consistency in their exact dimensions. It seems as though each piece was custom carved to fit in a given space as though the wall was just planned and created as they went along which seems almost impossible given the grand scale of the project. Whatever towers, walls, or battlements used to sit atop the remaining walls were cannibalized by the Spanish when they took over the nearby city of Cusco and began remaking it in their image. It is likely that the huge stones of the lower walls were simply too large to move and thus the impressive walls of Sacsayhuamán were saved. Whatever the reason, the precision construction on display is one of the more impressive displays of Incan ingenuity that we still have.",engineering ruins

The Museum of Anthropology, Archaeology, and History in Lima, Peru, contains over 10,000 of these skulls, packed together tightly in the museum’s Human Remains Gallery. The room is filled with so many skulls that it has been speculated to be the largest ancient skull collection in the world. The collection also includes hundreds of ancient ceramics and stone statues. Perhaps the most interesting of the museum’s 10,000 skulls is the Paracas collection, known worldwide for their stretched, elongated shape. These strange skulls have foreheads that are massively taller than those of normal humans, which many archaeologists suspect is the result of rigidly tying cloth or two pieces of wood around the head to show elite status in society. The debate over whether the skulls’ elongated shapes stem from cultural, genetic, or perhaps alien origin makes the Paracas collection one of the museum’s main draws and its most highly disputed exhibit.  The room of 10,000 ancient skulls is off limits to the public, and you'll have to settle for the 8 skulls they have on exhibit.

The Uros people have been living on the lake for hundreds of years—they were forced to take up residence on the floating islands when the Incas expanded onto their land. In the shadow of the Andes, on the world’s highest navigable lake, they make their living from fishing and from selling their reed handicrafts to tourists. The Uros use the totora reed, which is plentiful along the edges of the lake, to make their homes, their furniture, their boats, and the islands they live on. Their boats, which are shaped like canoes, but with animal heads at the prow, are used for fishing and to bring visitors out to the islands, which are usually moored to the bottom of the lake, but can be moved if necessary. As reeds disintegrate from the bottom of the islands, which are four to eight feet thick, residents must add more to the surface, which is soft and occasionally spongy. Each island has a collection of simple, reed houses, and the biggest island has a watchtower: originally, the mobility of the islands was used as a defense mechanism. Even tiny outhouse islands have been created, and the ground roots of the outhouse islands help absorb the waste. But despite the traditional lifestyle, the Uros people are not against modern amenities. Some families have motorboats or solar panels, and the main island is home to a radio station that plays music for several hours each day. The islands can be reached from either side of the lake, although Puno, Peru, is probably the easiest point of access. Contact local travel agencies for details.  Backpackers may want to consider the hop on/off bus service Bolivia Hop (the sister company to Peru Hop). The bus arrives early in Puno, just in time for a morning boat ride to Uros Floating Islands.

Each of the figures stands a remarkable eight feet tall and change, constructed out of grass and clay and built right into the cliff face. Some of the graves even still retain the human skulls that were installed atop the sarcophagi. It was not until the mid-19th century that researchers were able to scale the cliff face and examine the mummies, dating them and speculating as to their construction. It is believed that the original architects of these graves worked from natural outcroppings which were later destroyed either deliberately or naturally.

It’s an impressive thing to imagine and even more spectacular to behold. Cut by the Cotahuasi River, the canyon forms a fantastic landscape of traditional Andean farms and terraced fields, steep canyon walls and plunging gullies, and occasional pre-Inca and Inca ruins. The immense chasm is located in southern Peru, about 123 miles northwest of Arequipa. Its deepest point runs near the village of Quechualla, a six or seven-hour trek down the canyon from the town of Cotahuasi. Near the latter town, the canyon runs closest to its nearest high point: the extinct volcanic massif of Nevado Solimana, which has a peak that stretches 19,990 feet above sea level. The canyon is protected by the Reserva Paisajistica Subcuenca del Cotahuasi (Cotahuasi Sub-basin Landscape Reserve), which covers about 1,212,175 acres, an area just slightly smaller than the Grand Canyon National Park. As well as protecting the local flora and fauna, including the magnificent Andean condors, the reserve helps maintain a traditional way of life. The often centuries-old agricultural practices of the local farmers include the cultivation of crops such as kiwicha, quinoa, tarwi, chulpe maize, muña, and a variety of other beans (the kind of things that stores in more developed countries package and sell as “superfoods”). You’ll also see farmers leading packs of llamas and herds of sheep, and if you find yourself wondering why some of these farmers have one strangely bulging cheek, it’s because of the locally grown coca leaves they chew to give themselves more energy in the rugged environment. Despite being a prime location for trekking, climbing, and kayaking (class IV and V), Cotahuasi Canyon receives far fewer visitors than its more famous neighbor, Colca Canyon, which is some 60 miles to the southeast. Colca, being closer to Arequipa and more accessible, is one of the region’s main tourist destinations. Cotahuasi, however, is the deeper of the two by a few hundred feet, providing bragging rights to anyone adventurous enough to walk its rim or plunge its depths. You don’t need a permit to enter the reserve, but you’ll probably need some solid planning. The town of Cotahuasi has a range of simple lodgings and restaurants.

From a distance, it looks like a sliver of silver parting the forest, serene and graceful. If you dare to get closer to a plunge pool, however, you’ll feel the raw power as the cascade batters the rocks, kicking up spray like a storm as it roars through the wooded landscape. Yumbilla is the fifth tallest waterfall in the world. It’s tucked away in the Bosque de Cataratas Gigantes de Cuispes (“Forest of Gigantic Waterfalls of Cuispes”) near Chachapoyas, Peru. Watching the water cut down through the cloud forest for 2,940 feet is a stunning sight. Though it’s beautiful, not many people have heard of Yumbilla Falls, and not many people have seen it—at least not in comparison to the far more famous and touristy Gocta Waterfall eight miles to the south. Both waterfalls are huge (Gocta ranks anywhere from 16th to a doubtful third tallest), and both were only recently made known to international audiences. Yumbilla, despite outranking its neighbor in terms of height, wasn’t known globally until two years after Gocta gained widespread attention. For Yumbilla, international recognition came in 2007 following an expedition by the Geographical Institute of Peru. Researchers used laser instruments to determine its height. The locals, of course, have known about it for as long as anyone can remember. You need a guide to enter the Bosque de Cataratas Gigantes, which you can arrange in Chachapoyas through Canyoning Explorer (an agency that specializes in canyoning and rappelling down Yumbilla and other nearby falls) or in Cuispes, the small town nearest to the falls. Once inside, a well-made circuit of trails takes you from one waterfall to the next. From Cuispes, you should be able to reach Yumbilla within two hours.

Many of their massive temples, fortresses and cities were left standing, but without any clues as to their purpose. Qenqo Temple, fifteen minutes from Cusco is similarly mysterious and a dark account has formed in the historical vacuum. In Quechua, Qenqo means labyrinth or zig-zag and the temple is named for the crooked canal cut out of its rock. Although it is clear the canal carried some sort of liquid, researchers have been forced to guess at its purpose, and at what liquid it transported. Hypotheses range from carrying holy water, chicha (corn beer), or blood. All three indicate that Qenqo was used for death rituals, possibly to embalm bodies or detect whether a person lived a good life by the course the liquid followed. Qenqo is a unique temple in its construction as well, having been entirely carved out of a gigantic monolith. Stretched across a hillside, the temple is carved out of rock and marries the man-made tunnels with natural chambers. One of these chambers features 19 small niches and is set up as an amphitheater. Once again, the purpose of the theater has been lost over time, but most agree the area was used for some type of sacrifice to the sun, moon and star gods who were worshipped at the site. From the information available, it appears Qenqo Temple was an extremely holy site for the Incas. Their dead were judged and possibly embalmed in Qenqo’s winding tunnels, and blood sacrifices were offered to the heavenly gods. Despite the probable grisly purpose of the temple, its carved tunnels and chambers are an amazing work of ancient architecture, and a trip to Qenqo is sure to turn the wheels of mystery inside every visitor. 3 kilometers northeast of Cusco",lost tribes cultures and civilizations rites and rituals ruins

Something about it just feels eternal. Named for the delicate orchids that dot the landscape, the name means “forever young” in the native Andean tongue of Quechua—a name perfectly suited to such an ageless site. The ruins date to the mid-15th century, constructed during the days of the powerful Incan Empire. They are one of the stops along the Inca Trail, and the exact purpose of the site is tough to say. It may have been a spiritual or religious destination, or just a place for elders or royalty to rest before arriving at the end of the 26-mile journey to Machu Picchu. The ruins consist of upper and lower collections of Incan architecture, connected by stone steps that are laid out in graceful curves. The upper structures have a unique, circular building, while below there is a collection of linear parapets with sharp peaks, jagged walls, and massive stone slabs with little space between them. The precarious staircase between the two levels hugs a long line of ancient fountains, often referred to as baths. In addition to the architectural structures, the area is surrounded by an agricultural complex, terraced with extraordinary masonry out of local fieldstones. Perhaps most remarkable about the site is how limited the Inca were in terms of the available construction tools. With nothing more than implements made from bronze or stone, the amount of human labor required for such a massive production is almost impossible to imagine. Wiñay Wayna is in a cloud forest, with mist rolling in and out, a lush deep-green on steep mountain slopes, and a steady waterfall casually reclining in the distance. Despite the beauty of the surroundings, it is almost always devoid of tourists, with the occasional Inca Trail campers the only people in sight.  These ruins are a stop along the Inca trail, just about 3 miles (4.7 km) shy of Machu Picchu. They are a short walk down from the campsites and are accessible between 8am and 8pm.",landscapes mountains ancient ruins
425,Inca Bridge,"Aguas Calientes, Peru",A backdoor to Machu Picchu that only the most foolhardy infiltrator would attempt to breach.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/inca-bridge,"One of the lesser-known features of the Machu Picchu archaeological site, the Inca Bridge is a “secret” entrance to the citadel. Built into a spectacular path along a sheer mountain side, the simple plank bridge could quickly be removed to scupper the progress of any unwanted arrivals. The Inca Bridge (sometimes written as Inka Bridge) is a 25- to 30-minute walk from the center of Machu Picchu along a narrow path with some sheer drops down into the abyssal canyons below. And while plenty of tourists hike up Huayna Picchu, Machu Picchu Mountain, and to the Sun Gate, not many seem to go—or even know about—this alternative side trek. The bridge itself, at least as it appears today, is a simple plank of wood that spans a 20-foot gap in the stone path. With the plank in place, Inca messengers could continue along the mountainside. But with the plank raised, would-be attackers or infiltrators would have a terrible time trying to cross the gap, especially with armed defenders on the other side. A unit of enemy soldiers would be sitting ducks, perilously exposed to arrows, slings, and hurled rocks. For safety reasons, the Inca Bridge is blocked off to the public by a small gatehouse, but you can get plenty of good views of the bridge from the path. You can also see the extent of the incredible trail as it snakes away on the other side of the bridge, along an almost vertical mountainside. The path on the other side of the bridge is crumbling away in some sections, partly because any restoration efforts would be costly and dangerous.  Small signposts point the way to the trailhead that leads to the Inca Bridge. If you’ve left your guide to explore the site independently and you’re having trouble finding the trailhead, ask one of the many Machu Picchu wardens. It’s an easy trek along a decent and relatively flat trail. There are some scary drops along one side, but the path is wide enough to give some sense of security. It might be a challenge if you’re not good with heights, but give it a go: It’s worth the effort. You do not need an additional ticket to see the Inca Bridge.",incas mountains bridges archaeology

427,"Choquequirao, Peru",Peru,"White llama terraces dazzle in Peru's ""other Machu Picchu.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/choquequirao-peru,"Known as the other Machu Picchu, Choquequirao (“Cradle of Gold”) is preferred by serious hikers who enjoy the untamed nature of the trails. Remoteness and inaccessibility have kept most potential tourists away from this ruined Inca city in south Peru, leaving a pristine landscape to be enjoyed by those who dare to enter. Similar in structure and architecture to Machu Picchu, Choquequirao is filled with ruined buildings and terraces that sit below a flattened hilltop that was leveled several hundred years ago and ringed with stones to create a platform. Built during the reign of King Pachacuti Inca Yupangui, Choquequirao is believed to be the last city that the Sons of the Sun took refuge in when fleeing Cusco in the 16th century. Tucked into the Salkantay Mountain Range in the Cusco region above the valley of Rio Apurimac, only about one third of Choquequirao, a once vital link between the Amazon Jungle and the city of Cusco, has been excavated. What has been uncovered to date follows traditional Inca construction: a temple and some administrative buildings are positioned directly around a central square with the living quarters of more common people further out. U.S. explorer Gary Ziegler has said that the number of niches and double jamb doorways in Choquequirao construction proves that the lost city was once held in high status. The first excavations in the area didn’t begin until the 1970s. One of the most impressive features found in and around Choquequirao is a set of terraces that incorporate figures of llamas or alpacas. The shapes of the animals have been set into the large terraces using carefully carved white rock. The Peruvian government has proposed that a cable car be installed to bring tourists to the region. As it stands now, visitors must endure a rough two-day hike from Cusco that is only recommended for experienced climbers. Rock and mud slides in the area are common, especially during the rainy season and most guides say that the trail to Choquequirao is twice as difficult as the Inca Trail used to access Machu Picchu. Unpaved, the dirt trail climbs nearly a mile on the second day of the hike alone. Nearly all trekking agencies in Cusco offer a guided hike to Choquequirao. Book at least a couple of weeks in advance and find an outfit that includes meals, snacks and water for each day of the hike. Those interested in saving money can take a five hour bus to the small village of Cachora, where mules and a guide can be rented without the expensive middle man that is the Cusco Travel Industry (just about all travel companies will do the same anyways).",cultures and civilizations natural wonders nature ruins
428,Pachacamac,"Lima, Peru",The remains of what was the most important religious complex in coastal Peru for over a millennium.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pachacamac,"As far as pre-Hispanic Peruvian gods go, Pachacamac was a pretty heavy hitter. The maker of the Earth; the soul that animated the world; god not only of creation but also fire and earthquakes, with a visage too terrible for mere humans to gaze upon: Pachacamac was, without a doubt, a big deal. So it’s hardly surprising that a settlment named after the god, and centered around a shrine dedicated to him, would end up being a big deal as well. Pachacamac started out as a settlement by the Lima culture around 200 CE and included not only the “Earth-Maker’s” temple but also the god’s oracle, who was believed to be able to predict the future and control the movement of the Earth, and whom pilgrims consulted for help, advice, and prophecy. Though originally a religious center with only local significance, its influence spread after coming under the control of the larger Wari culture in roughly 650, and later the Yschma culture in 1100 following the collapse of the Wari. Both the Wari and the Yschma expanded Pachacamac with religious as well as secular building projects and used it as an administrative center in the region, but otherwise seem to have allowed the complex to operate largely autonomously. The importance of Pachacamac was such that even the conquering Inca had to respect it when they took control in 1470. In an unprecedented move, the Inca admitted the god Pachacamac to a top spot in their pantheon and allowed the religious activity in the city to carry on independent of the Inca state religion (though they did make their own addition to the city in the form of a temple to their sun god, Inti). Such was the significance of this centuries-old religious center. Then, in 1533, 15 Spanish idiots looted the place. The pyramids and temples were torn down, and the bricks and stone were used to build colonial stuff. Rediscovery and excavation of Pachacamac began in 1939 and continues to this day. Contemporary visitors can see the remains of some 20 different sites including several temples, mausolea, and other ritual sites, all over an area of almost 1,500 acres. Depending on the time of the year, it can get very hot at Pachacamac—the same goes for the desert coastal regions of Peru. Because you're close to the equator where the sun's effects are the most intense in the world, the chances of getting a severe burn are high! There is very little shade at the site so bring a heavy sunscreen with you, at least a 50 SPF.",religious parks pyramids temples
429,Cueva de Las Lechuzas,"Las Palmas, Peru","A jungle cave in Peru of unknown depths, otherworldly sounds, and strange nocturnal birds that navigate by echolocation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cueva-de-las-lechuzas-cave-of-the-owls,"An overwhelming cacophony of clicks and chirrups and other strange sounds surround you when you stand inside the Cueva de Las Lechuzas. This gaping cavern is the entry point to a more extensive and largely unexplored cave system, and is home to stalactites, stalagmites, insects, bats and, most intriguingly, nocturnal oilbirds that navigate using echolocation. The Cueva de Las Lechuzas (Cave of the Owls) is located inside Tingo Maria National Park, one of the oldest national parks in Peru. Few foreign tourists make it to this part of the country, but those that do soon hear of the so-called owl cave and its strange inhabitants, after which it is erroneously named. The cave is actually home to a colony of some 3,000 oilbirds (Steatornis caripensis), which local residents initially confused with owls. Apart from their shared love of the night, these two species have little in common. Oilbirds, known locally as guácharos, are the only flying, exclusively fruit-eating, nocturnal birds in the world. And along with swiftlets, oilbirds are the only birds known to use echolocation. It’s a fairly rudimentary form of echolocation—nowhere near as advanced as in bats and dolphins—but enables them to click their way through the pitch-dark caves. Other inhabitants of the Cueva de Las Lechuzas include bats, massive but (mostly) harmless spiders, and many more strange insects. Parrots, swallows, and hummingbirds also flit in and out of the cave entrance. The cave floor, as you can imagine, is littered with bird droppings. Thankfully, a wooden walkway leads over the squidgy ground and almost to the rear of the cavern. You’ll pass numerous stalagmites and stalactites as you head into the cave. One stalagmite, located just inside the cave entrance, is known as “The Thinker” due to its resemblance, at least from some angles, to Auguste Rodin’s famous sculpture. Only serious spelunkers should head far beyond the end of the walkway. Since 1972, various expeditions, first from the United Kingdom and then consecutively Peru, Spain, and Holland, have surveyed the cave. But as things currently stand, and despite a general consensus that the system is far more extensive, cavers have only penetrated the first 400 meters (about 1300 feet). Locals also tell tales of other groups who have ventured deep into the caves, never to be seen again. The presence of Histoplasma capsulatum in the cave system makes extended exploration risky. This fungus, found in the dropping-rich soil on the cave floor, releases spores when disturbed. The spores can settle on the lungs causing histoplasmosis, otherwise known as cave disease. Or, as the locals call it, fiebre de Tingo Maria, Tingo Maria fever.  The cave entrance is just inside Tingo Maria National Park, a few miles from Tingo Maria. It’s easy to reach by mototaxi. Pay at the park entrance (a couple of dollars) and walk the short distance to the cave. If you visit the cave in the late afternoon, stick around for sunset. You might witness the entire oilbird colony fly out of the cave as night falls—a spectacular sight and sound. It’s worth taking a torch to the cave, but you should keep it aimed at the ground to avoid disturbing the oilbird colony.",jungle sounds national parks birds caves ecosystems science animals
430,San Pedro Cemetery of Ninacaca,"Cerro de Pasco, Peru",A colorful Peruvian city of the dead.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/color-cementery-san-pedro,"San Pedro Cemetery is neither distinctly religious nor distinctly Peruvian. Breaking out of both molds, the cemetery in Ninacaca is bringing some new color and form to the deceased. Instead of rows of headstones, and entirely lacking crosses, San Pedro Cemetery is filled with strange architectural models, a miniature city for the dead. There is no theme running throughout the cemetery, and the crowded monuments seem to allude to hundreds of styles, across every continent in the world. Peruvian cathedrals stand next to Kremlin-like structures across the row from Moorish influenced buildings. Although the monuments are colorful and more playful than typical cemeteries, the origin of the tradition is heartbreaking. In 1989, a terrorist attack was launched against the village and the mayor was killed and a village leader was kidnapped. To commemorate the tragedies, the people of the town created a miniature replica of a school for a teacher that was murdered and the new tradition was born. A standard monument costs between $250-$1000 and is built by local workers specifically for clients. Clients are allowed to choose their monument and dictate every detail of design. Most of the monuments reflect the heritage or beliefs of the deceased, which has been the impetus for the menagerie of architectural styles. Although it began with a tragic event, the San Pedro Cemetery is now a beautiful celebration, and a colorful and evolving city of the dead.",small worlds and model towns miniatures memento mori catacombs and crypts
431,Museo de la Coca (Coca Museum),"Cusco, Peru",A fascinating little museum all about the rich history of Peru’s famous plant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/coca-museum,"Andean cultures have cultivated coca for thousands of years. The history of the plant’s use is rooted in the pre-Columbian civilizations that stretched across the mountainous ranges of South America, long before the arrival of the white powdery drug that gave the plant worldwide recognition. People traditionally chewed coca leaves for nutritional and religious reasons. Workers and warriors alike would carry it between their teeth because they believed the plant could ward off hunger and bolster stamina. Coca was also known to have medicinal properties and was used to treat a wide variety of ailments ranging from altitude sickness to dehydration to broken bones. The arrival of the Spanish introduced coca to the wider world. But it was the invention of cocaine in the 19th century that gave the plant its claim to fame. Coca itself is harmless—it’s the chemical process of isolating its main alkaloid to form cocaine that makes the drug toxic. Even Coca-Cola owes its name and existence to the plant; coca leaves were used as a flavoring agent. Coca is still an important part of modern Andean cultures. People chew the leaves or steep them to form a potent tea. Because it’s toted as an antidote to altitude sickness, it’s fairly common to see tourists sipping coca tea in an attempt to acclimate to Cusco’s elevation or power up before trekking the Inca Trail (just note: after ingesting any coca tea, drug tests will be positive for cocaine). The Coca Museum contains art, pictures, artifacts and information that reflect the plant’s importance to past and present Andean peoples. After touring the museum, visitors can stop by a gift shop stocked with everything from coca chocolates to teas to liquors.  The museum is on San Blas square. It's a tiny doorway that is easily overshadowed by the neighboring tourist shops (look for the small sign above the door).",coca cola drugs flora medicine collections plants museums and collections museums history
432,Rodadero Slides,"Cusco, Peru",Did Inca children also slide down these smooth rocky slopes above Cusco?,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rodadero-slides,"Across from the imposing Inca citadel of Sacsayhuamán is a huge rock formation in which the Incas carved benches, steps, altars, and various other ceremonial features. Just as striking as these manmade additions are the natural slides that undulate their way down the hill. Built by the Killke culture and later expanded by the Incas, Sacsayhuamán served as both a military and ceremonial complex. Stroll across the main plaza to the north of the citadel’s massive zigzagging walls and you’ll come to the Rodadero, also known as the Suchuna, a huge geological formation of diorite rock. In Spanish and Quechua respectively, Rodadero and Suchuna mean “slide.” The names refer to a series of smooth rock channels that run down one section of the hill. The well-polished slides are a strange, incongruous sight among the straight lines of monumental Inca architecture. Even more inconsistent with Sacsayhuamán’s general vibe of military power and somber ceremony are the kids—and adults—happily sliding their way down the rock chutes. Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, a 16th-century chronicler and illegitimate offspring of a Spanish aristocrat and Inca royalty, remembered the Rodadero slides well. According to Garcilaso, Inca children, himself included, once slid down these polished grooves in just the same way as today’s visitors, which kind of makes the Rodadero a 600-year-old amusement park. According to Moores and Wahl in The Art of Geology, three theories have been advanced to explain the formation of the “toboggan slide”: glacial, volcanic, and structural. Formation by glacier is unlikely, they argue, as “the nearest evidence of local glaciation occurs at least 250 metres above the Rodadero.” They also dismiss the idea that the grooves were formed by flowing lava, as the hill itself is not made of volcanic rock. That leaves structural: “Most likely, the grooves formed when blocks of rock moved past each other along a fault. The hill probably is the polished surface of an almost flat fault.” That polishing likely continued for at least the last few centuries, thanks to humankind’s propensity for sliding down things.",rock formations rocks geological oddities natural wonders geology nature

Whatever the case, the birds’ strange habit provides human visitors to the Tambopata National Reserve a rare chance to see this many exotic parrots up close and personal.

The pyramid, known as Huaca Pucllana, was built by members of the Lima culture, a Pre-Incan indigenous coastal civilization that lasted in the region from around 100 CE to 650 CE. The Lima culture and their contemporaries were notable for their mastery of irrigation, which allowed them to develop settlements across considerable territory. Surrounded by a desert climate, the Lima and other early Peruvian cultures created sprawling networks to carry much-needed water from springs and rivers to the towns. Huaca Pucllana served partially an administrative site for the surrounding irrigation zone. The complex is separated by a large wall running from north to south, and spaces that were likely used for public meetings, storage, and other production-focused undertakings are focused along its eastern side. The west half was a ceremonial sector, containing the 22-meter-high pyramid and used for religious rites. The Lima culture was overtaken by the Wari culture sometime around 700 CE. Under the Wari, Huaca Pucllana held significance primarily as a burial site for the nobility. The first intact tomb from this period was found on the grounds in 2008, and held the remains of three people: two adults wearing masks, and a sacrificed child. Today, the Huaca Pucllana complex includes an area for workshops, a small souvenir shop and a restaurant overlooking the ruins.

The original Andean patrimonial festival takes place in a picturesque white-washed town with blue doors and windows. In mid-July of every year campesinos from all over the Sacred Valley trek to the small mountain town to dance in the festival of the Virgen Del Carmen. Though many Andean towns have patrimonial festivals with traditional dances that mix indigenous beliefs, local legend, and Catholic worship, Paucartambo’s is the great-granddaddy of them all. Nowadays the festival is flooded with thousands of tourists, Peruvians and foreigners alike, who brave the lethal, winding mountain roads to binge on food and drink for five days straight. The spirit of debauchery is infectious. The crisp mountain air buzzes with the music of a dozen marching bands and the crack of incessant fireworks. Boarding room is scarce, so friends and families pack into windowless rooms occupied but once a year – and no one cares about the meager accommodations because the party in the street goes round the clock. You retreat to your cave only for some desperately needed sleep before you’re roused by the fear of missing something great. (Of course, nicer rooms are possible to find, though costly.) Over the course of the festival each of the dozen or so dance groups in full regalia enacts the story of its existence – one group represents the wealthy Spanish-blooded landowners with massive noses who strut side-to-side with jugs of beer and spurs on their boots. A group of devils, masked in Chinese dragon-style headdresses, scale the roofs of the town and entice the onlookers, tempting them to sin. After a day of parading through the town, each dance retreats to a large house or meeting hall for a night of sumptuous Andean cuisine and endless beer and pisco. These beer halls are packed to the brim late into the night, with revelers spilling out their doors only at the point of exhaustion. And for the truly brave of heart there is an early-morning excursion which is perhaps the greatest treat of all. After a sweaty climb through the fierce cold, clutching bottles of rum, the dauntless trekker finds himself at Tres Cruzes, the edge of the Andes, looking out at the sunrise exploding over thousands of miles of rainforest.

437,Marcahuasi Ruins,"Callahuanca, Peru",A mysterious pre-Incan ruin believed to have miraculous healing powers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marcahuasi-peru,"An ancient ruin site perched on a plateau in the Andes mountains, Marcahuasi was made famous by archaeologist Daniel Ruso in his book, Marcahuasi: The Story of a Fantastic Discovery. According to the book, it was believed that the ruins contain at least 22 vortexes of three different kinds of healing energies. Marcahuasi is located near the Peruvian village of San Pedro de Casta. The villagers of San Pedro De Casta are thought to be the guardians of the ruins, and ask for a small fee from visitors who would like to see the site. After paying the fee, amateur explorers embark on a seven kilometer trek to the ruins, ascending mountains that disappear into the clouds. The site features stone formations thought to be around 10,000 years old. The strange rocks resemble human, animal, and religious figures, and are thought to be the remains of a pre-Incan civilization, although there is some debate on where these structures actually came from. While many believe that the rocks were carved, it is also possible that simple erosion created the formations. There are also a number of ancient structures that prove there was a form of civilization at some point in the past lending credence to the theory that the rocks were created with intent. As for the energy vortices that supposedly reside around the area, they are believed to have a sort of healing energy, with each vortex containing a specific kind of healing power. There aren’t any specifics about which vortex does what, but there’s a story about a Peruvian man who was paralyzed by a car accident who went to the ruins, and was miraculously healed by its energy after encountering a mysterious man in the ruins. Like the details of the healing energy vortexes, there’s no specifics about how the paralyzed man hiked up the seven kilometers to the ruins either. Take a colectivo from Lima to Chosica (one hour).

The isolated location makes it an extraordinary place to observe the nature and wildlife of the rainforest, largely undisturbed by humans. Situated in the Tambopata National Reserve in the Madre de Dios region of Peru, the lodge doubles as a research and visitor center. The Tambopata province is one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet, and the region is so secluded that few roads can reach so far in the dense jungle. Therefore, visitors and researchers at the center are stunned by the proximity of rare creatures. Within the reserve, you’re able to observe animals with a Planet Earth-style intimacy—only without the screen of separation (or the captivating narration of Sir David Attenborough). The reserve is home to more than 670 species of identified birds including macaws on their clay lick and the harpy eagle, a raptor that preys on sloths. Many of the thousand-plus species of insects are unknown to science. There are also 200 species of mammals, including jaguars, tapirs, and giant anteaters. Poisonous and colorful frogs hop among the trees where rainbow boas hide. Swimming in the oxbow lakes are giant otters, a threatened species of weasel that is 5.5 feet long. Over 10,000 species of plants live in the Tambopata region, making it one of the most diverse places in the world for plant life. While few indigenous Peruvians lived in this region, a small population still lives off the land. Many are given the opportunity to work in ecotourism at the center. However, this sometimes results in workers being ostracized from their community. Indigenous peoples also harvest Brazil nuts on local farms supported by nonprofits that help prevent deforestation. Despite these efforts, deforestation is still a threat due to illegal gold mining. Visitors are allowed to come and stay for multiple days in an all-inclusive jungle lodge with daily tours. The tour also combined a one-night visit the the nearby Refugio Amazonas lodge with its canopy tower for spotting colorful birds. As more people are given the opportunity to explore and learn about the incredible life thriving in the Peruvian Amazon, the hope is their stay will help fund research and protection of this precious area. After upgrades to the lodge, guests can now enjoy a choice of Superior, Comfort, Suite, and the Deluxe Suite. The Deluxe Suites offer a large private balcony with comfortable seating and tables to relax surrounded by rainforest.  Reaching the lodge is an adventure in itself. You'll fly to the Puerto Maldonado airport, take a little over 40-minute bus ride to the pier, followed by a three-hour motorized canoe ride to Refugio Amazonas, where you'll spend your first night. The next morning you'll continue down the Tambopata River on a four-hour canoe ride to finally reach Tambopata Research Center.

439,Pizarro's Tomb,"Lima, Peru","Now containing the bones of the actual conquistador, instead of someone else.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pizarro-s-tomb,"For almost a century, the mummified remains of the conquistador Francisco Pizarro were on display in a glass casket in the Cathedral of Lima, Peru. The remains were visited by Catholic and Spanish pilgrims and studied by historians. So it was awkward when, in 1977, workers uncovered a completely different casket engraved with the words, “Here is the skull of the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro who discovered and won Peru and placed it under the crown of Castile.” Pizarro was born in Trujillo, Spain, the illegitimate son of a noble family. His ambitions led him as a young man into the company of Vasco Núñez de Balboa on his expedition to Panama, making this illiterate goatherd from Spain one of the first Europeans to see the Pacific Ocean. (The ocean was named by Balboa, at the time, the Mar del Sur, or “South Sea.” The name “Pacific” was bestowed seven years later by Magellan.) It was perhaps an early indicator of his personality that Pizarro turned on Balboa in 1519, a situation that left Balboa dead and Pizarro the new mayor of Panama City. Fueled by tales of El Dorado, Pizarro mounted three expeditions into the Inca lands to the south in the following years. In 1532, he began his Spanish-backed official mission to conquer Peru and claim it as New Castile. Unsurprisingly, the Inca were disinclined to hand over their lands to the Spanish interlopers. Highly outnumbered and far from reinforcements in Panama, Pizarro resorted to subterfuge to gain the upper hand. He invited the Inca emperor Atahualpa and his army of 80,000 to a meeting in Cajamarca. Since the central square was much too small to host such a large group, only a small entourage accompanied Atahualpa to the square, unarmed as a sign of good faith. That good faith was famously misplaced, and Pizarro’s men surrounded and killed most of the entourage and took Atahualpa captive. After convincing the emperor to fill a room full of gold and treasures from his Empire as ransom, Pizarro had him garroted. In the years after his conquest, Pizarro lived high on the hog on his riches and fame in the new town of Lima, which he helped establish. During this time, Pizarro and his brothers began fighting with one of their men over shares of the booty. Eventually the Pizarros had the man killed (garroted, again) and his son stripped of any fortune. Three years later, his supporters had their revenge, attacking the Pizarro household at dinnertime. Pizarro fought back, killing two men and attacking a third, but when his sword became stuck in one man’s chest, he could not defend himself from deadly blows to his neck and head. Pizarro’s body was moved several times over the following years, from the plaza behind the cathedral to a spot under the altar. In 1891, the body was disinterred and placed in an elaborate glass-sided coffin to celebrate the 350th anniversary of his death. It was not until 1977 that several other forgotten coffins were discovered in an old crypt. One of the boxes, once cleaned, bore a troubling inscription, identifying the contents as the skull of the conquistador. With the help of forensic anthropologists and historians, it quickly became clear that these were in fact the correct remains, identified primarily by the numerous sword blows to the head. This new body was moved into the glass coffin, and the unknown squatter removed to a less glamorous place of final repose.

440,Huascarán National Park,"Huallin, Peru","The highest tropical mountain range in the world is in Central Peru, home to a vast array of exotic and quirky plants and animals.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/huascaran-national-park,"Near the small Peruvian city of Huaraz is Huascarán National Park, over 13,000 square miles that include the world’s highest tropical mountain range, and at over 22,000 feet, Peru’s highest peak. The Park is named for its showiest mountain, which in turn is named for the Inca emperor Huascar. He didn’t reign for very long — only five short years in the middle of the 16th century — but his big snowy rock in the middle of the Cordillera Blanca (the White Mountain Range) in the central Andes rises high above all others in Peru. For a little perspective, the world’s tallest mountain, Mt. Everest, reaches 29,000 feet. Since the 1980s, the Park has been a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it also falls under the umbrella of SERNANP, the Peruvian network of protected natural areas. Aside from the cloud-scraping mountains, there is a lot to protect. There are tropical glaciers, pristine turquoise lakes, and hundreds of unique — and sometimes eccentric — plants and wildlife. A short list would include spectacled bears (who really do look like they’re wearing glasses), giant hummingbirds (well, giant by humming bird standards), South American camels (called Vicuñas, the national animal of Peru), and scrappy, ring-tailed Andean mountain cats. On the flora side, there are almost 800 different species of high-altitude plants, including the spectacular Queen of the Andes, which shoots a flowery stem 30 feet straight up from her spiky bottom. It’s rugged, it’s high, it’s cold — and it can get shaky up there (earthquakes are fairly frequent). But Huascarán’s show-stopping terrain and delicately balanced ecosystems make for a National Park like no other. It’s recommended to use authorized tourist companies (see links at the iPeru website), as specialized guides are required for boating, hiking, climbing, trekking, camping and other activities.
Temperatures vary at different altitudes, and it can get really cold depending on the height and the time of year. The rainy season is generally December through March, and prime tourist season is May through October.
The closest city is Huaraz, which you can fly to from Lima (the flight is about an hour), and there are also bus lines if you prefer an over-land journey (which takes about 8 hours).",peru wildlife sanctuaries unesco national parks mountains
441,Guinea Pig Last Supper,"Cusco, Peru",A painting in the historic Cathedral Basilica depicts Jesus and his disciples dining on a traditional Peruvian menu.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guinea-pig-last-supper,"In this historic cathedral in the heart of Cusco, Peru, hangs a one-of-a kind religious and cultural painting that depicts a very unordinary twist on an otherwise common image. The original menu of bread and wine is a classic. However, this image of the Last Supper presents Jesus and his disciples dining on a uniquely local rodent delicacy. The Last Supper as painted by Marcos Zapata in 1753 is an obvious stand-out among the massive collection of art and archeological relics in the Cathedral Basilica in Cusco’s main colonial square. The large painting depicts Jesus and the twelve apostles gathered around a table preparing to dine on a guinea pig. The cooked guinea pig cannot be missed, lying paws up on a plate in the center of the table. Guinea pigs are native to Peru and can still be found today on many restaurant menus in Cusco, the former capital of the Incan empire. The artist Marcos Zapata was a Peruvian Quechua painter and member of the Cusco School, a tradition of teaching European art techniques in the Americas which the Spanish used as a method to convert the native Incas to Catholicism. Several painters at this time incorporated local indigenous elements in religious works, but it is surprising that this piece of art was tolerated by the Catholic Church, especially during the time of the Inquisition. Yet the guinea pig Last Supper survived, likely because when the Spanish constructed several cathedrals a large amount of art was required to decorate these new places of worship — the Church was unlikely to punish such a prolific artist as Zapata. And perhaps, a locavore version of the Last Supper was even seen as a positive way to convert natives to the new religion. Located in the city’s Plaza de Armas, the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption took almost 100 years to construct, finally completed in 1654. In addition to being a place of worship, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and holds a large collection of Cusco’s colonial art.  The cathedral is located in Cusco's Plaza de Armas. Visiting hours are Monday to Sunday 10:00am to 6:00pm. Tickets are S/. 25.00 for adults and S/. 12.00 for students.",paintings religion churches sacred spaces art
442,Bosque el Olivar (Olive Grove Forest),"San Isidro, Peru","A pretty park of over 1,600 olive trees that grew from just three saplings brought over from Spain.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bosque-el-olivar-olive-grove-forest,"In 1560, not long after the fall of the Inca Empire, the Spaniard Antonio de Rivera (or Ribera) sailed from Sevilla, Spain, to Lima, Peru. He brought with him more than 100 olive saplings. Only three survived the journey, but from them 3,000 more would grow by the time Peru gained its independence in 1821. At the heart of the upscale San Isidro District of Lima, Peru lies the Bosque el Olivar, or Olive Grove Forest. It’s a beautiful place for a stroll, with 44 species of trees and more than 20 species of birds, including scarlet flycatchers, blue-gray tanagers and Harris’s hawks. There’s a lagoon with ducks, a cultural center, and plenty of wooden benches for canoodling couples. All in all, it’s a charming oasis in Peru’s frequently chaotic capital. And it all started with Antonio de Rivera’s three olive tree saplings. They thrived in Lima’s mild desert climate, its subtropical temperatures well suited to growing olives. Over the following two centuries, the olive grove grew and passed from one upper-class owner to the next, eventually ending up in the hands of the Count of San Isidro in 1777. By the onset of the Peruvian War of Independence (1811-1826), the park was home to more than 3,000 olive trees. The war, however, would take its toll on the grove. In a particularly petulant example of colonial bad form, some exiting Spanish royalists decided to take out their disgust on the defenseless trees. They hacked and they slashed and probably shouted obscenities at their firmly rooted and entirely inoffensive foes, chopping down many and scarring many more before fleeing the newly independent nation. But the olive grove survived. Some of the older specimens still bear the scars of Spanish blades, but at the last count 1,674 olive trees now stand in the Bosque el Olivar. The park was declared a National Monument in 1959, and the district council declared it an environmental conservation area in 2017. So for now, at least, the trees can continue to thrive in the midst of Lima’s urban sprawl.",forests trees parks ecosystems plants food history

The few and far between roads and paths scar a landscape where ancient civilizations arose and fell. Remote and oasitic stone ruins hide beneath the bromeliads.The Chachapoyas, or “Land of Cloud Peoples,” holds many mysteries. Kuelap, a mountaintop fortress city, rivals any ruins in the new world and comes complete with living quarters for thousands of residents and a stone wall fortification reaching 60 feet high running in circumference to the city. Kuelap is considered the largest stone ruin site in the New World and is comprised of massive stone blocks nearly 10-times the volume of the blocks used in the Giza Pyramid. The fortress of Kuélap consists of massive exterior stone walls containing more than four hundred buildings. The structure, situated on a ridge overlooking the Utcubamba Valley in northern Peru, is roughly 600 meters in length and 110 meters in width and is thought to have been built to defend against the Huari or other hostile peoples. Archaeological evidence shows that the structure was built around 500 AD and occupied until the mid-1500s (Early Colonial period). Nearby the ruins can be found “purunmachus” or stone tombs built in the shape of people that would have housed the mummified remains of Chachapoyas royalty.

The complex, consisting of 16 circular buildings connected by twisting roads and a number of accompanying terraces and platforms was discovered in the 1960’s, first by local villagers and just years later by an exploring archeologist. The structures date as far back as 200 BCE, and are decorated with elaborate slate mosaics and carvings that were likely added during a later era of prosperity between 800 and 1500 CE. Depicting birds, humans, and other Incan iconography, the designs give the site an extraordinary air of living history. Unfortunately this history is slipping away. Relatively few archeological projects have been centered on Gran Pajaten since its discovery, but each one has caused the ancient stone harm. Once the thick jungle overgrowth was cleared from the stones, the ruins were exposed to the elements as they hadn’t been for hundreds of years. Microorganisms and new flora found their way into the rock weathering it with astonishing speed. Each subsequent exploratory mission damaged the ruins a bit more. Given the fragility of the site, it was given protected status, but this, combined with its remote location led to a severe lack of tourism which often funds the protection efforts of such sites. Currently the Peruvian government is trying to construct an infrastructure that will support more tourism surrounding Gran Pajaten, which will in turn help protect the site from further human and natural damage. The site was also recently recognized by the World Monuments Fund as an endangered site and they are also working to help revitalize interest in the fragile and lonely ruins.",unesco archaeology ruins
445,Gran Hotel Bolivar,"Cercado de Lima, Peru","Visiting dignitaries and Hollywood stars once stayed at this 1920s hotel, alongside ghosts that are said to haunt its corridors.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gran-hotel-bolivar,"The Gran Hotel Bolivar was opened in 1924 as a place to house dignitaries visiting the Peruvian capital. During the subsequent half-century, it was the hotel of choice in Lima for Hollywood stars, acclaimed authors, and rock legends; then began its slow decline, along with rumors of massive paranormal activity. Back in its heyday, the Gran Hotel Bolivar was the place to be in Lima. Built by government request on state property and designed by Peruvian architect Rafael Marquina, its initial raison d’être was to serve as a sophisticated base for visiting politicians. Charles de Gaulle, Nixon, Robert Kennedy, and Emperor Akihito were all guests at the Bolivar, which is located on the regal Plaza San Martin six blocks from the Government Palace. International statesmen weren’t the only famous guests at the Gran Hotel Bolivar:  Faulkner, Hemmingway, and Orson Welles roamed the hallways. Ava Gardner danced barefoot in the bar drunk on pisco sours, later to be carried back to her room by a sober John Wayne. Mick Jagger strutted through the lobby before he and the rest of The Rolling Stones were thrown out for bad behavior, which wasn’t a surprise to anyone. Other music stars, including Julio Iglesias and Santana, were far more restrained. Despite being declared a national monument in 1972, the glory days of the Gran Hotel Bolivar were starting to fade. Mismanagement, financial follies, and an owner who supposedly fled the country didn’t help matters. As Lima began to modernize, new hotels bearing international brands flooded into the capital, far outpacing the antiquated charms of the Bolivar. Then there are the ghost stories. Lots of ghost stories. The fifth and sixth floors of the Gran Hotel Bolivar have been closed for more than a decade. According to the hotel, this is simply due to lack of funds, but more fanciful stories tell a tale of spectral activity so intense that the upper floors were simply shut down. Among many tales that have emanated from the hotel are sightings of a ghostly woman in white walking through the corridors and the ghost of a deceased former employee who never entirely checked out. Another apparition is said to be the ghost of a woman who, years ago, had thrown herself from one of the hotel windows. All in all, a stay at the Gran Hotel Bolivar is as close as you’ll get to The Shining in Peru (without the skiing), but don’t let that put you off: The now three-star hotel is still full of old-school charm, and the bar at the Bolivar is still well-known for serving the best pisco sours in Peru - as Ava Gardner soon found out.  The hotel's stately, balconied rooms start at just $80; even the historic presidential suite is a reasonable $208 per night.",political provisions ghost stories celebrity haunted places to stay hotels music
446,Cerro Blanco,"Naska pruwinsya, Peru",This unimaginably large pile of sand near Nazca is one of the tallest dunes in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cerro-blanco,"Sand dunes are tricky things to measure, but Cerro Blanco near Nazca, Peru, has a legitimate claim to being one of the tallest dunes on the planet. It’s certainly the largest in Peru, and potentially in the world. Cerro Blanco, also known as Duna Grande, rises up in the deserts to the southeast of the city of Nazca. At around 3,860 feet (1,176 meters) from base to peak, the giant sand dune is taller than the highest mountain in England. From its peak, you can see the entire Nazca Valley and, on a particularly clear day, the Pacific Ocean. The Nazca civilization once believed the dune to be a source of water, even believing some kind of lake or reservoir lay at its center. Some locals still believe this legend and walk up to the top of the dune to leave offerings, in much the same way as the Nazca before them. Sandboarders also make the exhausting trek up to the top of the dune, where the sun beats down and the dry wind offers little relief from the heat. They might also zip up in a 4x4 dune buggy, which seems far more sensible but isn’t always easy to arrange, as even the most nimble of vehicles struggle to get up the dune. Either way, once at the top these thrill-seekers have a largely unimpeded path from peak to base, enjoying uninterrupted slides of 2,600 feet or more down the steep face of the dune. The descent lasts around four minutes at full speed - or a lot longer if you keep falling over.  You can organize Cerro Blanco excursions in Nazca. Most trips leave early in the morning to avoid trekking up the dune in the heat of the day.",dunes world's tallest deserts natural wonders nature
447,Usko Ayar,"Pucallpa, Peru","Art school in the Amazon: Drugs, nature and sustainable agriculture.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/usko-ayar,"In 1988, shaman and painter Pablo Amaringo opened the Usko Ayar art school. Translated in Quechua as Spiritual Prince, the roots of his work were in his religious experiences with ayahuasca, a powerful hallucinogen used by many healers in the Peruvian Amazon. But despite his own works’ connection to the DMT-laden brew, his school was created to provide opportunity for hundreds of youths with no chance to develop their own artistic talent. After being approached by an anthropologist named Luis Eduardo Luna, Amaringo began transforming his home into an art school. The men hoped to inspire their young students with the nature around them. Bringing in a class of a few dozen children who would otherwise have no opportunity in the often-poverty stricken rainforest regions of Peru, the Usko Ayar school opened. With the support of donors and art sales, the school grew and incorporated other skills into the education. Besides teaching drawing and painting, the school also taught english and other basic subjects. Each painting that was sold was split between the student artist and the school, providing funding for the project while supplementing the income of families used to relying on slash and burn agriculture along the river. The success of Usko Ayar has brought in other funding for schools in the Amazon, and the United Nations honored the project in 1992. Since that time, hundreds of promising artists have gotten their start in the school and returned their time and money to their community, working to promote sustainable agriculture and education in the region. Although Amaringo died recently, the school is still in operation in its original studio and has served over 700 students ranging in age from 8-24. The school can be visited, and much of Amaringo and his students’ art is on display and available for purchase.",outsider art
448,Paracas Candelabra,"Pisco, Peru","The mysterious ""Candelabra of the Andes"" could represent anything from a god's trident to a hallucinogenic plant.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paracas-candelabra,"Etched deep into a Peruvian seaside hill, the Paracas Candelabra, more colloquially known as the “Candelabra of the Andes,” is a massive geoglyph whose origin is still unknown. Thanks to carbon dating of artifacts found near the monumental work, it has been dated back to around 200 BCE, but the purpose and creators of the symbol are still unknown. The design, which takes the general form of a bulbous three-pronged fork, is etched a good 2 feet into the petrified sand of the hill and runs almost 600 feet from tip to tip. Its description as a candelabra is a bit of a misnomer as it has never truly been thought to represent a such an item. Instead a number of theories abound as to its significance. One prominent theory is that the geoglyph is meant to evoke the trident of Incan creator god Viracocha, possibly created in order to curry his favor. Another theory posits that the symbol is meant to stand in for the local Jimson weed which has hallucinogenic effects and may have held a ritual significance, the large design acting as a beacon home for people tripping on the drug. Still others believe that the etching was simply a sign meant for sailors looking for the Paracas coast. Whatever the true nature of the ancient monument is, it continues to capture the imaginations of researchers and visitors to this day. Maybe its true value is not in the truth of its existence but in the questing it inspires. Visitors can see Paracas Candelabra by taking a boat trip from Paracas to Islas Ballestas (also known as 'poor man's Galapagos'). However you cannot get off the boat so have your camera ready.

449,Nazca Lines Observation Tower,"Nazca, Peru",This metal tower in the desert provides views of a handful of Nazca geoglyphs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nazca-lines-observation-tower,"For people who don’t want to fly over the Nazca Lines, or who want to see them closer up, the Nazca Lines Observation Tower offers an alternative (and cheaper) view of three of the Nazca geoglyphs. The Nazca Lines Observation Tower (Mirador de Las Lineas de Nazca) sits alongside the Panamericana Sur highway, about 16 miles northwest of Nazca. And while there’s no doubting that a flight over the Nazca Lines offers a far better view of the 19 square miles of geoglyphs, the observation tower does have some benefits. If you don’t like flying, then the 42-foot-tall metal tower offers a far smoother experience than the light aircraft that bank and roll above the Nazca Lines. It’s just four staircases to the top, with only the desert wind occasionally buffeting the tower. It’s cheaper, too, compared to the $80 US or more that you’ll spend on a 30-minute Nazca flight. It costs just S/ 2 (about $0.60) to enter the tower, although you’ll spend more than that getting there. And then there are the views, which are… decent. From ground level, the Nazca Lines are impossible to see, at least in terms of making out any kind of shape (and it’s illegal to walk near them). From the top of the tower, you get an oblique view of two geoglyphs: the Tree and the Hands. They’re not the most interesting of the geoglyphs, but you can at least see them from a relatively close distance, something you can’t do from the plane (unless something goes badly wrong). A third geoglyph, the Lizard, is also viewable from the tower. It, however, had an unfortunate encounter with the highway. Unlike the many local lizards who get squashed trying to cross the road, in this instance the road ran right over the Lizard. The Panamericana cuts right across its tail, so it doesn’t look great from the tower. The builders of the Panamericana Sur generally maintain that the Nazca Lines were discovered after the construction of the highway, but that isn’t strictly true. Work began on the Panamericana (Pan-American Highway) in Peru in the 1930s, but the Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejía Xesspe had spotted the Nazca Lines in 1927. That said, the true extent of the Nazca Lines was only known after the highway was built, with more geoglyphs still being discovered today.  It’s easy to reach the Nazca Lines Observation Tower from Nazca, either by taxi, bus or tour. Small buses and colectivos heading north along the Panamericana Sur can drop you off at the tower. It takes about 30 minutes and costs S/ 2 or S/ 3 (less than a dollar). Tours costs around S/ 50 ($15) and are worth doing if they include the observation tower as well as a trip to the nearby Maria Reiche Museum. Some also include the Mirador Natural, a natural lookout point on top of a small hill, from where you can see some different geoglyphs. You don’t have to pay for this mirador, which lies less than a mile to the south of the tower.",
450,Tomb of Enrique Torres Belón,"Lampa, Peru",This Peruvian bone silo lined with hanging human skeletons and hundreds of skulls is topped with a remarkable Michelangelo replica.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-enrique-torres-belon,"Off the dusty road between Lake Titicaca and the former Incan capital of Cusco, Peru, is the unassuming town of Lampa. Founded in the 16th century, this Spanish colonial outpost is most known for its more modern addition: a bizarre tomb attached to its historic church. The small town has a number of unique sights, from a working chinchilla farm on its outskirts to intricate mosaics in its central plaza, but what stands out the most is its enormous colonial church, the Iglesia Santiago Apóstol. Connected to the church is Enrique Torres Belón’s freaky mausoleum, a silo of bones capped by an aluminum replica of Michelangelo’s Pietà. Engineer and politician Enrique Torres Belón, one of Lampa’s most famous sons, designed and built the tomb in the mid-20th century so that he could rest in peace, along with his wife, surrounded by the earthly remains of the city’s forebears. The otherworldly tribute is lined with hanging human skeletons and hundreds of skulls exhumed from the town’s cemetery and the crypts beneath the church. At the bottom is a black marble cross, whose lighting exaggerates the eerie shadows cast by the macabre wall hangings. Topping the dome over the carefully arranged bones is a replica of the Pietà, arguably Michelanglo’s most famous sculpture. The original Renaissance masterpiece is housed in St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City, but anyone wanting to see another copy of the sculpture won’t have to travel far.

451,Pongo de Mainique,"La Convención Province, Peru","A paradisical gorge with rapids, waterfalls, and wildlife whose raw beauty is the stuff of CGI movies.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pongo-de-mainique,"Many bombastic claims circulate about Pongo de Mainique. It has a reputation as the most dangerous rapids in South America, and is said to have some of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. It’s also viewed as a highly spiritually charged location and is English comedian and travel writer Michael Palin’s favorite places in the whole wide world. First of all, as the name may not be familiar to everyone, Pongo de Mainique is used to refer indistinctly to both a gorge in the Vilcabamba mountain range and the rapids of the Urubamba River that are formed in this gorge. It would make sense to think of Pongo de Mainique as an area including both the canyon and rapids. This is the exact place where the Andes and the Amazon basin meet. Pongo de Mainique may or may not be the most dangerous rapids in South America, but it is certainly dangerous. (Ranking rapids according to the danger they represent is doable, but it entails a certain degree of subjectivity and falsifiability.) The rapids are only navigable between May and October, and even at that time, you need experienced boatmen with extensive knowledge of Pongo de Mainique. Prior to tackling the rapids, it is customary for boats to make a quick stop at a makeshift landing and let the passengers off the boat to pray for a successful passage. The area is as beautiful as it is daunting. The six square miles of forest around Pongo de Mainique have indeed an “extraordinarily high” level of biodiversity. Whether you’re ascending or descending the rapids, you are unlikely to see any fauna, as you’ll be busy holding onto the boat for dear life. There is, however, a clear sense that the forest changes at the entrance of Pongo de Mainique. The river narrows and the shore seem to struggle to contain the vegetation, which overflows on the water. As for the claim to mysticism, it goes back to the Incas, to whom Pongo de Mainique was a holy place. Inhabitants of villages up and downstream maintain that their long-gone ancestors believed the huge vortices created by the strong currents and the boulders were a portal to another dimension. In more recent years, these beliefs have been revived by new age spiritual seekers. And finally, Michael Palin. In a 2006 piece in The Guardian, Palin mentioned Pongo de Mainique as his favorite place in the world, remarking that, “It really is like being in an antediluvian paradise.” And if this is the time for name dropping, Werner Herzog shot some dramatic scenes of Fitzcarraldo at Pongo de Mainique. Pongo de Mainique is difficult to reach and even more difficult to get through, but its raw beauty is the stuff that you see in CGI movies.  It is possible to organize an all-inclusive tour to Pongo de Mainique. For those that prefer a DIY approach, going upstream, head to Atalaya and get a boat to Sepahua. In Sepahua, you may have to wait several days before a boat goes on to Nuevo Mundo. From there, hitch a ride to Ivochote. This ride will take you through Pongo de Mainique. Going downstream, start from Ivochote and follow the reverse order. Only attempt this between May and October.",rivers water nature

Though it was abandoned long ago, the city is remarkably well preserved. Apart from the strategic, mountainous location, this site was probably quite unremarkable in its time. Its lack of grandeur may have been its saving grace. The conquistadores by-and-large neglected Huánuco Pampa, which helped it to survive and become the prime archaeological site it is today. Huánuco Pampa (aka Huánuco Viejo and Huánuco Marka) was built along the main Inca highway that stretched over 2,500 miles from Quito to Cusco. It was an administrative center built on a plateau conveniently defended by the steep slopes demarcating its perimeter. In addition to its administrative functions, Huánuco Pampa was also an important place to store foodstuffs. Its nearly 500 storehouses and numerous food processing centers showcase the massive planning and organizational skills the Incas needed to sustain a their sprawling empire. Dating Huánuco Pampa is no straightforward feat. It’s believed it was constructed after 1460 and then abandoned around 1539, when the conquistadores arrived in the region. Its construction was motivated less by the need to control natural resources than by bureaucratic motives. Today, on a stroll through Huánuco Pampa you’ll come across the remains of the baths and main palace. You’ll also see the enormous plaza where the Incas built a pyramid, which, from the top, is where dignitaries would oversee festivals and celebrations. Despite centuries of neglect and harsh weather, the finely cut and accurately set stones still showcase the refined and rare craftsmanship of the Inca.",incas ancient archaeology ruins history

The Museo Leymebamba (Leymebamba Museum) was inaugurated in 2000, specifically to house 200 or so mummies and their burial offerings. The mummies were recovered during a 1997 excavation of Llaqtacocha, a Chachapoya settlement on the banks of Laguna de los Cóndores, a lake about 50 miles south of Chachapoyas. Nestled in the limestone cliffs around the lake were a series of chullpas [tombs]. These stone burial structures had been untouched for 500 years, until local farmers started to rummage through the funerary site, doing significant damage in the process. Fortunately, the Centro Mallqui, a Peruvian cultural association specializing in bio-archaeological remains, was on hand to salvage the site. The archaeologists began to recover the mummies from Laguna de los Cóndores, protecting them from further accidental damage and the more nefarious intentions of huaqueros (grave robbers). In order to house so many mummies, the Centro Mallqui initiated the construction of an entire museum in Leymebamba, the town closest to the lake. Today visitors stroll around the museum’s first two rooms, which display various artifacts from the region; these include ceramics, weapons, and decorative items from the Chachapoya and provincial Inca periods. Next comes the third room, where large windows provide a disturbing vista of the mummy collection. Hundreds of them: many wrapped, some eerily exposed, most sitting in the classic funerary position - knees raised up to their chests, arms crossed. It’s an unnerving sight. Some of the mummies stare back at you with pained expressions, an occasional face so well-preserved that it looks like it could blink. A few bundled babies also sit on the shelves, their tiny bodies carefully wrapped in cloth. The Chachapoya were skilled embalmers. They treated the skin, vacated bodily cavities, and plugged up those parts that could be plugged. They then left much of the remaining mummification process to the cold, dry, sheltered lakeside ledges, whose microclimates helped to preserve the organic remains. Now, in the controlled climate of the museum, the mummies have found a new resting place. Here they sit, huddled together like a lost tribe, eternally silent—but speaking volumes to the archaeologists who continue to study them.  Leymebamba is easy to reach from Chachapoyas. Minibuses leave the main bus terminal regularly for Leymebamba; the trip takes about one hour and 45 minutes. The museum is located up above Leymebamba. Take a minibus or taxi from the main square up to the museum. It’s easy enough to walk back down. You can also visit Laguna de los Cóndores from Leymebamba, but it involves a tough 9- to 10-hour trek and a night spent at the lake. You can also ride there by horse, which is recommended by most local operators.",mummies tombs burial places archaeology museums

It’s full of ceramic artifacts that illustrate how these cultures represented their everyday lives, including their sex lives. Many pieces within the museum’s Erotic Gallery show scenes that depict reproduction. However, multiple pieces represent rituals of non-reproductive sexual acts, like oral and anal sex as well as masturbation. Some pieces were intended to be humorous, while others show humans, divine beings, and even skeletons engaged in erotic encounters. Quite a few pieces celebrate fertility and maternity. In the artwork, the woman is often touched, caressed, kissed, or penetrated. Ceramic vessels also show pregnant women, women giving birth, and women breastfeeding. The Larco Museum believes this erotic pottery is a unique and interesting opportunity for people to approach sexuality, free of their own prejudices.

A gift of the British Embassy, the little bear now watches over the Miraflores Boardwalk, a playground, and the Pacific Ocean. Unveiled in July of 2015 to commemorate the strong ties between the UK and Peru (his original home in the story), this Paddington was one of 50 bears designed by artists, actors, politicians (and at least one supermodel), originally scattered all over London to create the “Paddington Trail.” The designers were an eclectic bunch, running the gamut from Nicole Kidman to Rhianna, from David Beckham to Kate Moss, from Andrew Lloyd Webber to Bear Grylls. This particular one was designed by British comedian Stephen Fry. Having made his way back to Peru, Paddington’s new playground perch is located in Parque Salazar along the Miraflores Boardwalk, looking out over the Bay of Santander. The statue’s dedication was overseen by Alan Yarrow, Lord Mayor of the City of London (where there is another Paddington statue at the little bear’s namesake train station), and Jorge Muñoz, Mayor of Miraflores.

456,The Twelve-Angled Stone,"Cusco, Peru",This geometric feat is a testament to the Incas' mesmerizing architectural abilities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/twelve-angled-stone,"World-renowned for their master masonry skills, examples of the Incas’ architectural prowess can be found throughout South America. But there is no specimen that better showcases that expert craftsmanship than the “twelve-angled stone” found in downtown Cusco. Fashioned out of green diorite, the twelve-angled stone is part of the Lienzo Pétreo wall, an inward leaning wall that encircles the now-destroyed Palace of Hatunrumiyoc. Comprised of multiple massive stone blocks, the wall was built without the aid of mortar or any kind of binding material. Each block was cut to fit perfectly with every other surrounding block, requiring a painstaking amount of care and attention to detail. In fact, the joints of the wall are so precisely fashioned that even today, hundreds of years after it was first constructed, not even a single piece of paper can fit between any of the wall’s blocks. While the entire wall is a sight to behold, the stone of twelve angles, so named for the twelve distinct cuts that form twelve corresponding joints, stands apart as the crown jewel of this geometric feat. It remains a popular attraction in the Peruvian city, and a longstanding testament to the Incas’ devotion to their craft.  The twelve-angled stone is now part of a wall of the Archbishop's Palace and draws large crowds of curious visitors. As such, if you'd like to take your time to appreciate this marvel, it's best to visit as early in the day as possible.",incas crafts archaeology architectural oddities architecture
457,Cusco Cathedral,"Cusco, Peru","Situated on a sacred Inca site, this 16th-century cathedral took nearly 100 years to build.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cusco-cathedral,"Cusco Cathedral is located in the heart of southeastern Peru within the city of Cusco’s Plaza de Armas. Designed in the Gothic-Renaissance style with Baroque touches, floor plans for the magnificent church were built in the shape of a Latin cross. While construction began in 1559, the edifice wasn’t actually completed until 1654. Also known as the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin, the church is now a UNESCO World Heritage site containing major archeological relics, artifacts, statues, and hundreds of colonial paintings. But the church’s historical beginnings weren’t always benevolent. For starters, Cusco Cathedral church was built on the foundations of an ancient Inca temple called Kiswarkancha. The temple was the site of Viracocha’s palace, a 15th-century emperor named after the creator deity worshipped by the Inca people. The Kingdom of Cusco was once the capital of the Inca Empire and by the time Spanish colonizers arrived in the city, the majority of the population was Quechua Inca descent. Taking sacred stone from the nearby citadel of Sacsayhuamán located on the hills above the city, the Spaniards forced the Inca peoples to construct the cathedral. This supplanting of the original Kiswarkancha temple site was a degrading act, meant to destroy the Inca religion from the area and replace it with Catholicism. However, the Inca laborers added their own sacred, indigenous touches in the church’s construction, including the carved head of a jaguar on the cathedral doors. Spanish architect Juan Miguel de Veramendi drew up the original design plans, which would include an impressive architectural undertaking: only 14 cruciform pillars carved from Andesite stone were to hold up the roof, allowing for a three-aisled nave (the church’s central area). Cusco Cathedral’s interiors boast a High Altar embossed in silver and choir stalls made from pure cedar wood. The cathedral is connected to two smaller churches on either side: Iglesia del Triunfo (built in 1538) and The Sagrada Familia (completed in 1723). Perhaps the most important painting within the church is Marcos Zapata’s highly unusual “The Last Supper” (1753), which features Jesus and his disciples dining on traditional Peruvian dishes. The central dish on the table is a local guinea pig, however some claim that it’s not a guinea pig at all but rather a wild Andean chinchilla. Other cathedral highlights include a giant 17th-century bell (known as the Maria Angola Bell) that can reportedly be heard from nearly 20 miles away and a blackened wooden crucifix known as The Señor de los Temblores, which translates to the “Lord of the Earthquakes.” Most likely designed in the 16th-century, the distinctive black coloring of the statue is the result of accumulated candle and oil lamp soot over the years. It has since become something of a city treasure after it was believed to have thwarted damage caused by a 17th-century earthquake. Now acting as the patron saint of Cusco, the crucifix is paraded in a procession through the city during Holy Monday.   Visitors can enter the church using the entrance at the Sacred Family Church, located to the left of the cathedral’s facade. Cusco Cathedral is open Monday through Sunday, from 10 am to 6 pm.",
458,The Not-So-Abandoned Town of Zaña,"Zaña, Peru","After an epic flood washed away its enslavers, this city has been part ghost town, part cultural wildcard for the past three centuries.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zana,"Just inland and to the south of bustling Chiclayo lies the reputed “ghost town” of Zaña. Tucked in a fertile agricultural valley, the tiny town teems with ruins dating back to Peru’s colonial era and – to the astonishment of the few travelers drawn there for these ghostly shells of convents and cloisters – a whole host of current residents whose roots trace back hundreds of years, to a generation of Zaña’s whose spirit couldn’t be dominated by marauding pirates, conquistadors, or raging floods. Settled for millennia by indigenous inhabitants, the Zaña Valley became a powerhouse for Spain’s conquistador’s thanks to the vast gold and silver deposits hidden in its surrounding hills. In the centuries to come, the city of Zaña (officially “founded” in 1534) would rise in economic import, as its political heads established it as the most important city on the northern coast, surpassing even Trujillo. The reputation for wealth was so well known that the pirate Edward Davies would go so far as to launch a series of attacks on Zaña in 1686, lured there by the promise of treasure beyond compare. Part of maintaining Zaña’s economic status involved the use of slaves, hailing from both indigenous Andean communities and African slaves imported to the continent expressly to work in the mines and protect the city’s wealth from being sacked. Though business was bustling for the Spanish in spite of random pirate attacks and increased instability in the region, it was Mother Nature’s intervention that dealt the fateful blow to Zaña’s overlords. In 1720, records show that El Niño caused the Zaña River to overflow its banks in an incredible way, destroying the city in a flood of biblical proportions. Nearly everything the masters had built was destroyed. What little remained, rose from the decimated remains of Zaña, husks of an imported faith. The most impressive of these ruins include the San Augustine Convent, built in 1586, whose bombed-out center is a favorite spot for modern visitors to the town, who pause to gape beneath the open-air nave and frescoes still readily visible on its walls. Sun-bleached cloisters dot the horizon, and arches from the colonial period rise from Zaña’s fields and central plazas to this day, contributing to the idea that the city is as abandoned as when the Spanish left it in 1720. Yet a crucial piece is missing from this picture: only the Spanish left, convinced that the slaves’ devotion to their old traditions had called down hellfire on their fair city. The fact that the Zaña’s surviving black population, now free from their enslavers, remained in the city is a story history has mostly forgotten. What resulted from this lack of storytelling is the present widespread misconception of Zaña as a “ghost town,” rather than a city full of remarkable ruins, the country’s only Afro-Peruvian museum, its own unique kind of candy, no vehicular traffic, and a heterogeneous population that’s 1,000 strong. Indeed, Zaña’s history and traditions have survived anything thrown their way better than most places in the world… it’s just that most outsiders don’t know it.",floods gold slavery mines colonialism ghost towns ruins

Known as Aramu Muru and located on lake Titicaca near the border with Bolivia, the flat stone is roughly 23-feet square, with a T-shaped alcove some 6 feet, 6 inches tall carved into it. What purpose the space once served is unknown, but the most likely explanation is that it was an abandoned Incan construction project. . Locals are said to call the doorway the “Puerta de Hayu Marca,” or “Gate of the Gods,” and local legends apparently speak of people disappearing through the doorway as well as of strange sights, such as “tall men accompanied by glowing balls of lights walking through the doorway.” But as much of this type of reporting comes back from those who believe the doorway to be some kind of portal—such as paranormal writer Jerry Willis, who claims to have traveled through the doorway—it is hard to know which “local legends” are legitimate. And photographs of people goofing off in and around the “multi-dimensional portal” do little to add to its mystique.

460,Tombs of Sipán,"Lambayeque, Peru",The shockingly unspoiled Peruvian tomb of the Lord of Sipan was once guarded by a footless warrior.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tombs-of-sipan,"The story of the discovery of Peru’s Tombs of Sipán reads like something out of an Indiana Jones script with looters, a heroic archeologist, and the bizarre ritual guardians of the past. The unfortunate truth of many major archaeological discoveries is that by the time they are discovered by those with intentions of preservation, they have already been picked over by those with dollar signs in their eyes. This was almost the case with the Tombs of Sipán, the excavation of which was instigated by some bumbling thieves. Ancient ritual holy sites are known as “huacas” can be found all across Peru in such abundance that looters of these sites are known as “huaqeros.” In 1987 a group of these looters attempted to rob a huaca in Sipán, but they began squabbling about their riches to the point that the authorities were called in to put a stop to them. Recognizing that the unexplored burial sites in Sipán were in immediate danger, archaeologist Walter Alva rushed to the site to both protect it and begin excavation. Initially, Alva faced opposition from both looters and locals who saw him as just another huaquero. He was forced to hide in the former robbers’ hidey-holes at night while he tried to sway the locals to his cause in the day. Eventually, he was able to rally a team and begin a proper exploration of the site, and what he found was beyond his wildest expectations. Exploring the first tomb, he found a large corpse that had buried in a sitting position, notably missing his feet. It was later determined that this figure was a guard that was hobbled so that he might eternally guard what lay beyond. The figure that the footless warrior was protecting was the ancient Lord of Sipán, who was put to rest adored in a mind-boggling assortment of gold and jewels, all of which were still in place when Alva discovered the tomb. Not bad for a dead guard with no feet. As the excavations continued, another 14 tombs were discovered, each containing a wealth of well-preserved riches. The amazing finds were moved to a pair of museums in the area, one of which is still overseen by Alva to this day. The actual huacas have been fitted with replicas of the original finds so that visitors to the site can still experience what it must have been like to unearth one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th century.  The Moche tombs at Huaca Rajada are located near the town of Sipán in the middle of the Lambayeque Valley. Sipán is in the Zaña district in the northern part of Peru. Close to the coast, it is about 20 miles east of the city of Chiclayo and about 30 miles away from Lambayeque.

461,Cerro Sechin,"Casma District, Peru",The depictions of slaughter are surprisingly detailed at this mysterious ancient site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cerro-sechin,"It is unclear who built Cerro Sechin, or how they built it, or what exactly its purpose was. One thing, however, is abundantly clear: they liked making carvings of mutilated bodies. Part of the larger Sechin Archaeological Complex that was apparently the capital of the ancient Casma/Sechin culture and contains what is currently the oldest known urban site in the Americas, Cerro Sechin is the most carefully studied component of the ancient population center and, unlike the other commercial and residential sites, seems to have been an administrative and ceremonial center that served political-religious purposes. Largely completed before 2000 BCE and in regular use until 1500 BCE, the ruins of Cerro Sechin consist of a stepped temple platform flanked by ancillary buildings. However, the site is best known for the wall encircling its perimeter, which bears an astounding number of sculptures depicting gruesome scenes of butchery. This retaining wall was added somewhat late in the site’s history, and is adorned with roughly 400 granite bas-relief sculptures that depict two types of characters: victorious warrior-priests marching triumphantly with swords, axes, and scepters; and their overwhelmingly tragic victims who lay eviscerated and dismembered around them. The carnage is represented in remarkably graphic fashion, including severed heads and limbs, eyeballs plucked from skulls and set upon skewers, scattered viscera, and disembodied bones left to bleach in the sun. With so little known about who built this wall, the meaning of the bellicose images is left to educated speculation. Some theorize that the sculptures commemorate the results of a great battle in which the Casma people were conquered; others think it might celebrate a popular rebellion crushed by the ruling elite. Perhaps it is simply a representation of warfare and raiding common in that time and place, or a portrayal of demigods and other mythical figures in legendary events. It is notable that the anatomical accuracy of the images (particularly of enucleated eyes, pelvis and sacrum bones, kidneys, stomach, esophagus, and both large and small intestines) have led some to suggest that the site was a lab for anatomical studies or, at the very least, shows that the culture that created them had a sophisticated knowledge of anatomy and dissection. Whatever the ceremonial purpose and whoever the inhabitants, Cerro Sechin was abandoned by 800 BCE and lay buried and forgotten until is was rediscovered by Peruvian archaeologists Julio C. Tello and Toribio Mejía Xesspe in 1937. Today, visitors can look upon these well-excavated carvings and marvel at their sophisticated representations of corporeal destruction. It's easier to hire a car and driver to get here. Note that Casma can be dangerous at night, with hotels often keeping their gated walls closed and employing guard dogs.",ancient sculptures ruins
462,Tambomachay,"Cusco, Peru","An Inca spa, military outpost or maybe… both?",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tambomachay,"Tambomachay is an Inca archaeological site located just outside Cusco. Its precise function is unknown, but it may have served as a ceremonial site, an Inca spa, or a military outpost—or perhaps a mix of all three. Tambomachay sits on a hill about 4 miles north of Cusco, at about 12,150 feet (3,700 meters) above sea level. The structure consists of three stepped terraces of precise Inca stonework, with trapezoidal niches built into some of the retaining walls. The whole thing is built over, or into, a natural spring, which continuously feeds a series of small aqueducts, canals, and waterfalls built into the terraces. The site is also known as El Baño del Inca, or the Bath of the Inca. This refers to one of the long-held theories about the site’s function: that it was a spa of sorts for the Inca ruler, and maybe for the wider Inca nobility. It’s a secluded and tranquil spot, and the constantly flowing water would certainly have provided for all the Inca’s spa-break needs. But there was probably more going on at Tambomachay than just high-altitude bathing. As is evident at numerous sites throughout the Sacred Valley, water— and the control of water—had a ceremonial function for the Incas. They were able to control the flow of water with great precision, often bringing the water from springs way up in the mountains via stone channels and aqueducts, and finally to fountains and waterfalls at important points within their religious sites. Considering the presence of precise water features at Tambomachay, and its construction on a natural spring, it’s likely that it served a ceremonial function connected with water. The trapezoidal niches could also have served a ceremonial purpose, perhaps to hold offerings (trapezoidal niches and openings are, however, ubiquitous in Inca architecture, from the finest temples to the most basic walls). It’s possible that all this could have been tied in with the notion of a spa: if the Inca ruler did come here to bathe and cleanse himself, that in itself could have been a ceremonial process. Other archaeologists, such as Federico Kauffmann Doig, have argued that the primary function of Tambomachay must have been military. Kauffmann Doig pointed to the terraced nature of the site as evidence for this, the terraces being similar to defensive terraces found at other sites. Tambomachay is also located in close proximity to Puka Pukara, about 680 yards to the southeast, which was almost certainly an Inca military site. As with so many Inca archaeological sites, there’s a strong possibility that Tambomachay served more than one purpose. It could well have been both a military outpost and a ceremonial center, and perhaps even a spa for overworked Inca rulers.  Tambomachay is located just off the Carretera 28G that winds its way out of Cusco and up towards a number of important archaeological sites including Saqsayhuaman, Q'enqo and Puka Pukara. It’s easy enough to take a bus from Cusco to Tambomachay; any bus going to Pisac can drop you off on the way. If you’re feeling energetic, it’s a nice walk from Tambomachay back down to Cusco (but best to do that before it gets dark). The site is open daily from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Entrance is included on the Boleto Turistico de Cusco (Cusco Tourist Ticket), which costs S/ 130 ($40 US) and allows entry to numerous sites in and around Cusco and the Sacred Valley.

463,Tres Chimbadas Lake,"Tambopata, Peru",This small oxbow lake has rare giant river otters and some Seussian-sounding birds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tres-chimbadas-lake,"Tres Chimbadas Lake in southeast Peru is about 30 miles from the border with Bolivia. It’s a small oxbow, a little over a mile long and less than 12 feet deep. The landscape of the lake is serene, but it’s mad with wildlife. Jungle photography and catch-and-release piranha fishing are two big draws for Tres Chimbadas, and many people come for the giant river otters. They are the longest of all weasels, stretching over five feet from their whiskered faces to their flippy flat tails. Unlike other otters, they are a social bunch, and otter families come to the lake year after year to build their dens, and occasionally check out the eco-tourists. Despite the otters’ gruff and determined faces (trust—they’re cut when they’re pups), they are fairly subdued, if a bit territorial. Most important to keep in mind as a visitor, they are extremely endangered. Luckily lake guides take great care and caution when in their frisky presence, steering clear of babies and keeping noise down to a whisper. The other main attraction is bird watching, and their names are just as apt to send you to Dr. Seuss as to your field guide. There’s the Wattled Jacana and Horned Screamer, a Rufescent Tiger Heron and White-cheeked Tody-tyrant, the sweetly shy Undulated Tinamou and the devoted Black-capped Donacobius.

464,Puquios,"Nazca, Peru",The sophisticated hydraulic system of the Nazca civilization.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/puquios,"The puquios are an old and extensive system of subterranean aqueducts, surface channels, reservoirs, and spiraling holes that allowed the Nazca civilization to distribute water in one of the most arid places in the world. In the deserts and valleys of Nazca, droughts can last for years, but the Nazca civilization was able to survive and flourish in this region. This was due in large part to their impressive use of hydraulic engineering, an achievement arguably greater than the creation of the Nazca Lines. The hydraulic system of the Nazca, known as the puquios, is a combination of underground tunnels, small reservoirs, and strange spiraling holes that lead from the surface to the water below. It was used to carry water to both agricultural lands and to populated areas to supply drinking water. The Nazca built the puquios to connect to subsurface water, with the source often many miles away from where it was needed. The water was then channeled both underground and along the surface, with some parts of the system having multiple branches. The open trenches tend to be shorter than the underground channels, and some have a gentle S-shaped curvature along their course to slow the flow of water. The subterranean aqueducts were dug out and then covered, and in some cases extended by tunneling. The sides of both the underground and surface channels were typically lined with river cobbles. Along the course of many of the underground channels are strange spiraling well-like constructions known as ojos (eyes). At the surface, these ojos are sometimes 50 feet wide, their sides corkscrewing inwards as they descend to the channels below, where the bottom of the well is about three to six feet wide. When the puquios were first studied, it was generally assumed that the spirals functioned as wells, while providing access to the underground channels for maintenance and cleaning. But in 2006, a new study by Rosa Lasaponara and her team from the Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis in Italy gave a whole new perspective on both the ojos and the wider system of puquios. Lasaponara and her team studied the system using satellite imaging. This gave a better understanding of how the puquios were distributed across the Nazca region, and showed where they ran in relation to nearby settlements. This, in turn, cleared up some issues regarding the actual age of the system, which some previously claimed had been built by the Spanish. As the puquios had been built from local materials, carbon dating techniques were limited, and the Nazca had no written record to prove that they had built the system, but by connecting images of the extensive puquios to various settlements, Lasaponara provided strong evidence that the Nazca did indeed build the puquios some 1,500 years ago, and that the system must have been much more developed then than it appears today. As for the ojos, it also became more apparent that they had a function beyond that of a typical well or access point. Looking at the distribution of the ojos, Lasaponara explained how the spiral-shaped holes helped to funnel wind into the underground canals. The wind helped to push the water through the system, the ojos serving like ancient pumps.  Today, there are 36 puquios still functioning in three valleys in the Nazca area. The most famous system is known as the Acueductos de Cantalloc (Cantalloc Aqueducts), located a few miles outside the city of Nazca, where you can see surface channels, underground aqueducts and ojos. You can get there by taxi for around S/ 5 ($1.50 US) or take a tour for between S/ 30 and S/ 40 ($9 to $12), which will likely include stops at a museum or two and maybe a ceramic workshop. The Cantalloc Aqueducts are open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily.

Sure, plenty of fortified archaeological sites. A palace or two. An occasional coastal fortress. But Italian-style medieval replica castles? In the high jungle? Nope, not many of them. Just one, in fact. In 2005, Nicola Felice, an Italian expat and businessman, started building a medieval-style castle in the middle of a small town in the San Martín Region of Peru. A few years later, this towering structure loomed over the town, an eyesore to some but widely welcomed by most of the locals. The Castillo de Lamas is a totally random but undeniably impressive sight. Kitschy, sure. Totally in contrast to the local history and culture? Certainly. But the locals seem to love it, so who cares? Lamas is considered the folkloric capital of the San Martín Region and one of the most culturally significant settlements in the entire Peruvian Amazon. Its history goes back to the 1430s and the time of the Inca Empire, when the Pocras and Hanan Chancas were defeated by the Incas and driven from their lands. Fleeing in the face of a potential total downfall, the tribes headed east and ended up on the hilltop where Lamas now stands. The Spanish conquistadors and their missionaries came later and supposedly made friends with the locals, who allowed them to occupy the top of the hill. That, however, is open to some debate. Fast forward to the 21st Century, and now an Italian has made an indelible mark on the town with his faux castillo: an ersatz castle, complete with mock turrets and fairytale battlements. You could call it a culture clash on an epic scale. But the clash never came. Rather, the locals quickly came to love it. The castle was built shortly after a traumatic local event: an earthquake in 2005 that killed five people and left hundreds homeless. The castle’s construction created some much-needed jobs. And now, it’s arguably the most famous attraction in the historic town, drawing in both foreign and Peruvian tourists visiting the nearby city of Tarapoto, just 25 minutes away. For a few soles, you can stroll through the castle’s occasionally tasteful but frequently cheesy interior. There’s a restaurant and a small pool and some reproductions of famous paintings.

The Great Inca Square that preceded Plaza de Armas was twice the size of the modern day plaza that occupies the land today and was home to regular meditation ceremonies that were performed by Inca nobility. These ceremonies typically ended in tears, giving the original square the name Huacaypata, which translates to “place of crying” in Quechua—the indigenous and primary language of the Inca. While the Spanish greatly transformed Huacaypata, destroying native temples and buildings and replacing them with churches and mansions, the site has remained an important hub of social, political, and religious life for the people of Cusco, particularly as they fought for freedom from their Spanish oppressors. The famed rebel leader Jose Gabriel Tupac Amaru, who piloted a late 18th-century uprising against the Spanish colonists, was executed by dismemberment in the plaza in 1781 as a violent and public warning to others that may have been inclined to follow in his footsteps. Today, the death and memory of Tupac Amaru—who became a mythical figure in the Peruvian struggle for independence—is honored with a statue in the center of the square. Beyond political importance, Plaza de Armas is anchored by two of the city’s most well-known religious buildings: the Church La Compañía de Jesús and the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin. The Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin, also known as the “Cathedral of Santo Domingo” or simply as “the cathedral” was the first cathedral built in the city. Construction started in 1559 on the grounds of the Inca’s Kiswarkancha temple and the Spaniards actually used stones from dismantled Inca temples that lined the square to build the church, which was finished in 1654. It’s especially famous for its one-of-a-kind depiction of The Last Supper, with Jesus and his disciples dining on a guinea pig, a traditional Peruvian dish.  Although much of the Great Inca Square has been lost to time, Plaza de Armas is still a perfect way to reflect on the history and former glory of the Inca Empire and gain a better, deeper appreciation for what makes modern-day Cusco so special.",

The various shapes and designs are highlighted with white mineral pigment, contrasting sharply with the grey rocks, dark soil, and vibrant green foliage. A “caretaker,” who sometimes appears drunk or wincingly hungover, might emerge from a nearby shack to provide some background details. Depending on his current condition, he’ll either read out some official theories about the site as provided by a local university, or he’ll start to freestyle. If it’s the former, you’ll learn that the strange white lines remain an archaeological mystery. Since their discovery in 1966, only a handful of archaeologists have taken anything more than a cursory look at the site. It’s possible the petroglyphs were created by the Chachapoyas culture as they explored further east from their territory surrounding the citadel of Kueláp some 100 miles to the west. Alternatively, and perhaps more probably, they were made by local indigenous tribes—the Pocras or Hanan Chancas—who inhabited the area. The largest and most complex of all the designs could be a map of the region showing rivers, settlements, and trails. In which case, it could shed significant light on this area of Peru and the local tribes—or perhaps contemporary indigenous explorers —who inhabited or passed through this region. Other petroglyphs are obvious representations of local fauna including snakes and birds. But many defy simple identification. Considering the historic as well as contemporary use of ayahuasca in the region, some symbols might have been inspired by ayahuasca-induced visions. And what if the bleary-eyed caretaker starts to wing it? Well, he might tell you the dog or monkey petroglyph is actually a dinosaur, which would complicate matters somewhat. And that those other designs represent extraterrestrial visitors. And that the rock over there was actually a sacrificial altar. And that… well, whatever comes to mind, really. The petroglyphs of Polish are located about 5 miles outside Tarapoto. You can get there independently by mototaxi (rickshaw).

469,Chucuito Temple of Fertility,"Chucuito Province, Peru",Ancient Peruvian fertility temple or modern money-making hoax? Either way these monoliths still look like penises.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chucuito,"Chucuito is one of the few ancient sites in the world that is likely to elicit a few giggles. In many ways, you’re supposed to giggle when you walk through the walled-off complex covered in row after row of stone phalluses. Especially considering that this supposed ancient fertility clinic may just be a hoax catering to the immaturity of tourists. For more than half a century, archeologists and anthropologists have studied Chucuito Temple of Fertility, and have decided, with some debate, that the stones were placed in this order more recently than they were quarried and cut. Scientists even discovered that many of the stones were not originally set straight up, indicating that a perverse opportunist may have had a hand in the temple’s creation. Yet the findings of the scientists mean little to locals who work day in and day out to dispel these claims by giving tours of the temple. Altogether, there are 86 phallic stones in the temple, and some even stretch to five feet. According to legend, and most tour guides in the city, this temple was frequented by women trying to get pregnant. Under the guidance of a spiritual leader, women would climb aboard the mushroom rocks and be doused in chicha, traditional Peruvian corn beer, which allegedly helped them become pregnant. Adding to the confusion created by this legend, the site, which is named Inca Uyo, can be translated two ways. In Quechua, it means field, a perfectly logical translation. But a more modern twist translates the word into penis, which unfortunately fits the other side of the debate similarly well. Although no definitive answer will ever be discovered, the rocks resemblance to male genitalia remains uncanny. The easiest way to get to Chucuito and the Temple is to take a public bus south from Puno towards Juli. The bus ride will cost a nominal sum and take 20 minutes along the western bank of Lake Titicaca. Locals in town can point you in the direction of the temple.",mushroom rocks phallic hoaxes and pseudoscience rites and rituals
470,Cumbe Mayo and Los Frailones,"Chamis, Peru",Pre-Incan aqueduct amidst a stone forest in Peru.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-forest-los-frailones,"11,000 feet above the sea in the Peruvian Highlands, a 3,500-year-old aqueduct cut out of volcanic rock snakes down hills and valleys toward the city of Cajamarca. Built by an advanced pre-Inca society around 1500 B.C.E, the Cumbe Mayo, which translates to thin river, is thought to be one of the oldest man-made structures in South America. It carefully follows the grade of the land, draining water from the hills’ melting snow, to the arid cities in the valleys below. As water was a scarcity, it was worshipped by the Cajamarca people thousands of years ago, and every drop was carefully collected. Besides the aqueduct, which is cut from the volcanic rock around it, a number of petroglyphs on the structures and in surrounding caves provide some insight into the culture that built the infrastructure. Towering above the Cumbe Mayo, are Los Frailones, the Stone Monks. Los Frailones are massive volcanic pillars, some stretching as high as 60 feet. The stone forests suddenly appear from the landscape, starkly contrasting the flat, tree-less plains around Cajamarca. Many of the pillars, carved by wind and rain have taken on new shapes, resembling hands and even animals, and allowing the mind to wander in the pristine Peruvian setting. Although the stone forests and ancient ruins of pre-Incan society give the area a beautiful and almost spiritual dimension, it is hard to overlook Cajamarca’s tragic history, as the location where Spanish forces slaughtered the Incas, thousands of years after Cumbe Mayo was constructed.

The fine textiles that come out of Taquile are renowned the world over and are even protected as a UNESCO world heritage subject. However unlike the often tragically traditional view of knitting and textile work as the demesne of women, it is the men of Taquile Island do much of the delicate thread work. The craftwork is divided between weaving and knitting; women do the weaving, while the knitting is man’s work. The tradition begins when they are young as boys on the island begin learning their trade at the tender age of 8. Chief among these crafts are the iconic chuyo hats that many of the locals wear. Women can also be found making yarn and other tasks surrounding the creation of the items. The 2,000-some residents of the island are well aware of the tourist appeal of their lovely island and its traditional Spanish garments. They have gone so far as to create a rather unique model for their visitor industry where the villagers act as a community to manage the comings and goings of tourists as well as the attractions they offer. This was in response to outside interests taking control of the island’s tourism when it initially began in the 1970s.

Housed in a colonial building in the city center, it contains everything from playful pre-Inca artifacts to nightmarish dolls. The museum was opened in 2001 under the guidance of Peruvian artist Gerardo Chávez, a successor of the Trujillo-centric Grupo Norte (North Group), a community of writers, artists, and intellectuals that emerged in northern Peru in 1915. The initial collection contained many toys Chávez had purchased during his travels in Europe. Later donations allowed it to expand. The oldest artifacts, displayed behind glass in a special room, date back to pre-Inca times. They represent civilizations such as the Chimú and Chancay. The oldest and most delicate piece is a toy whistle from the Virú civilization, which existed on the north coast of Peru in approximately 200 B.C. The rest of the museum contains a wide array of toys from humanity’s more recent history. There are hundreds of lead soldiers from Europe, old Meccano sets from the United Kingdom, wind-up toys, colorful Wild West stagecoaches, Andean dolls, London buses, and much, much more. And then there are the dolls. They form a nightmarish collection of frightful figures who stare with near-dead eyes, chilling the rational souls of even the most scientifically minded skeptics. It’s pediophobia, pure and simple: the fear of dolls, distilled. So when the old wooden floorboards start to creak, when the rocking horse starts to rock with no rider upon it, it might be time to check your six. One thing’s for sure: you wouldn’t want to spend the night at this particular museum. The Museo del Juguete is located at Independencia 705, two blocks from Trujillo’s Plaza de Armas (main square).

473,Pampa Galeras National Reserve,"Lucanas Province, Peru",This high-Andean reserve protects the graceful vicuña that was nearly hunted to extinction for its precious wool.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pampas-galeras-national-reserve,"Located high in the Andes in the Ayacucho region of Peru, the Pampas Galeras national reserve protects the high-altitude habitat of the threatened vicuña, the timid and elegant relative of the alpaca and llama. If you’re lucky enough to see one of these adorable, delicate creatures in the wild, it’s easy to understand why the Incas considered them sacred. Though there were some 2 million vicuña roaming in the mountains at the height of the Incan Empire, the cinnamon-colored animals were almost hunted to extinction after the arrival of the Spanish. The conquistadors were after their extremely valuable wool coat—the luxuriously soft and warm fleece of the vicuña is one of the finest and most expensive natural fibers in the world. During the Incan Empire it was forbidden to kill the vicuña, so the wool was gathered in a humane shearing ritual known as chaccu, and the silky fleece was only worn by nobility. Unfortunately, the Spanish conquistadors used guns to hunt the lucrative animals, a practice that lasted for centuries until the vicuña was designated an endangered species in the 1970s. Today, Pampas Galeras is one of the largest sanctuaries working to protect this lovely creature. About 5,000 vicuña live within the boundaries of the reserve at altitudes of over 10,000 feet. The national reserve also helps support the rural Andean communities that live in harmony with the regional wildlife. One successful conservation method has been to give the local villages a stake in the vicuñas’ protection by bringing back the centuries-old chaccu shearing ceremony. Each June, the villagers corral the vicuña, shear the wool without harming the animals, and release them back into the wild. The shearing is often followed by a traditional feast with music, drinking, and dancing. This ritual benefits the isolated mountain communities by giving them the right to sell the animals’ expensive fleece, with the added benefit of deterring would-be poachers. Thankfully, the vicuña population has rebounded, and the animals are once again thriving in the windy Andean plateau. With the largest vicuña population in the world, Pampas Galera is one of the best places to see these graceful animals, as well as other native high-altitude fauna such as the guanaco, Andean foxes, Pampas cats, and many others.  The Pampas Galeras National Reserve (Reserva Nacional Pampas Galeras), a national park of Peru, is about 56 miles east of Nazca heading toward Cuzco. Full-day tours to start from Nazca for about USD $30 or 110 Peruvian sol. A night stay is recommended for visitors to fully appreciate the high-altitude natural vistas and scenery. Temperatures are usually very cold, so prepare for freezing nights if you're staying overnight, and possible rain between November and March.",wool incas nature preserves rituals hunting conservation animals
474,Rumicolca,"Quispicanchi, Peru",The Incas turned this ancient Wari aqueduct into an imposing defensive gate.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rumicolca,"At first glance, Rumicolca appears to be an imposing stone “gate” controlling access to the main highway leading west to Cusco. But look closer and you’ll see signs of an earlier construction: a pre-Inca aqueduct built by the Wari civilization. About 17 miles east-southeast of Cusco lies the sprawling Wari archaeological site of Pikillaqta. The site is hard to date, but may have been occupied from 500 to 1000 AD. It likely served as a feasting and ceremonial center. Pikillaqta is a lesser-known archaeological site in the Cusco Region, but receives a steady stream of tourists thanks to its inclusion on the “Cusco Tourist Ticket,” which grants access to a number of sites in and around Cusco. One thing many tourists miss, however, is the nearby site of Rumicolca. It’s just a short walk along the main road leading up to the southeast of Pikillaqta. And while it can’t rival its neighbor in terms of acreage, it’s arguably more impressive. The most pervasive archaeological theories about the origins of Rumicolca tend to agree that it was first built by the Wari civilization as an aqueduct. Along the top of the wall-like structure, which is now a mix of Wari and Inca construction, runs a channel that likely brought water to the nearby center of Pikillaqta. It’s also possible that the Wari built the aqueduct to serve a secondary function as a gate or control point along this important route. A few centuries after the collapse of the Wari, the Incas expanded and fortified Rumicolca. It seems that these new empire builders were more interested in Rumicolca as a gate or control point. They reinforced sections with unmistakable Inca stonework: huge slabs of perfectly cut and perfectly joined andesite stone. It’s easy to see the difference between the Inca stonework and the far simpler Wari walls. At their highest, the walls of Rumicolca reach up to 39 feet. Openings within the walls allowed travelers to pass through when given permission, and perhaps after paying a toll to the Inca soldiers guarding the entrance. If enemy forces arrived along the highway, Rumicolca would have proven a tough barrier to breach, delaying any attempts to march on Cusco from this direction. Whether or not the Incas also used Rumicolca as an aqueduct is hard to confirm. But the water channel is still easy to see running along the top of the wall. Rumicolca is easy to reach from Pikillaqta, just walk up the main road leading roughly to the southeast. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes on foot. Entrance is free.",
475,Huaca de la Luna,"Moche, Peru",The outside of this exposed Moche pyramid is covered with striking colorful adobe friezes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/huaca-de-la-luna,"You might expect that an ancient pyramid built of adobe bricks wouldn’t hold up well over time, that wind and rain would erode it over the centuries. But excavators digging into the Huaca de la Luna (Temple of the Moon) in Moche, Peru, found that inside the pyramid’s deteriorated exterior was a series of earlier and smaller pyramids that had retained not only their stepped shape, but their colorful friezes as well. The northern Peruvian Moche Empire lasted from about 100 to 700 A.D. and was centered at a complex called Huacas del Moche, located about three miles from modern-day Trujillo near the mouth of the Moche River Valley. The bone-dry coast of Peru where the Moche farmed can be harsh and unforgiving, so the Moche did everything they could to help ensure the success of their crops of beans, corn, and potatoes. This included engineering a sophisticated system of irrigation canals and, to appease the gods that controlled the weather, huge temples and blood sacrifices. The priests oversaw ritual one-on-one battles between their warriors, then slit the throats and drank the blood of the losers. Warriors captured from battles with neighboring groups were similarly sacrificed. Graphic evidence of these sacrifices is recorded on enormous stretches of pyramid friezes and also on the masterfully crafted ceramics excavated from the Huaca de la Luna site. The friezes include representations of the creator god Ayapec, who sometimes resembles a half man-half jaguar and other times is depicted as a horrific spider-like creature frequently referred to as “The Decapitator.” It should be noted at this point that the priests ritually consumed San Pedro cactus, which contains the hallucinogenic drug mescaline. This may help explain the nightmarish nature and appetites of the deities they communed with as well as the intense palette of colors displayed on the pyramid’s facade. Sadly, all the sacrifices seemed to be for naught. Studies of ice cores drilled from Andean glaciers indicate that starting around 536, a super El Niño period caused 30 years of intense rain followed by 30 years of drought. The Moche eventually abandoned the site and resettled in the Lambayeque Valley to the north. Later the area was populated by the Chimu people and, in the 15th century, by the Inca civilization. The Spanish arrived on the scene in the 16th century, but only to rechannel the Moche River so they could blast open and loot the nearby and larger Huaca del Sol (Temple of the Sun). The site then was largely abandoned until professional archeologists began excavations in the 1990s. The Huacas del Moche site has only been open to tourists since 2011. Significant stabilization, excavation, and restoration efforts are ongoing.  A 10-minute walk from the site is the Museo Huacas de Moche, containing exhibits explaining the Moche culture. The nominal entrance fee includes an English- or Spanish-speaking guide. Visit the museum before heading over to the Tourist Reception Area for the Huacas del Moche site, where you can, and definitely should, hire a certified guide.",cultures pyramids cultures and civilizations indigenous temples ancient archaeology
476,Machu Picchu Discovery Plaques,"Aguas Calientes, Peru",It took 82 years and four different plaques to finally get the story right.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/machu-picchu-discovery-plaques,"Two plaques attached to a rock face near the entrance to Machu Picchu pay tribute to Hiram Bingham and his “discovery” of Machu Picchu. Another marker, erected later but of lesser quality, pays tribute to the often overlooked local people who helped Bingham, and who lived at the site at the time of his arrival. Up until 1993, visitors walking into Machu Picchu would see two bronze plaques paying tribute to Hiram Bingham, the U.S. academic and explorer credited with the scientific rediscovery of Machu Picchu. The first plaque was erected in October, 1948, by the Rotary Club of Cusco. It reads (in Spanish): “Cusco is grateful to Hiram Bingham, scientific discoverer of Machu Picchu in 1911.” The second was put in place in 1961. It reads (also in Spanish): “Tribute to Hiram Bingham on the 50th anniversary of the discovery of Machu Picchu.” A third bronze plaque marks the 75th anniversary of the “scientific discovery” of Machu Picchu. It doesn’t mention Hiram Bingham, nor does it mention anyone else, apart from a reference to the “sons of Inti” who built Machu Picchu (Inti being the Inca sun god). Finally, in 1993, Peru’s National Institute of Culture decided it was time to pay tribute to the locals who helped Hiram Bingham find his way to Machu Picchu. The sign reads: “The National Institute of Culture Cusco pays homage to Melchor Arteaga, Richarte and Álvarez who lived in Machu Picchu before Hiran [sic] Bingham.” These words are etched into a now weathered stone tablet that looks older and far less sophisticated than Bingham’s bronze tributes. It’s also not particularly easy to read. And whoever made it managed to spell Hiram Bingham’s name incorrectly (on purpose, one might mischievously surmise). So who were these men? Melchor Arteaga was instrumental in Bingham’s expedition to Machu Picchu. A local farmer living at Mandor Pampa near Aguas Calientes, Arteaga knew the location of Machu Picchu and showed Bingham the way. The other two names, Richarte and Álvarez, refer to two men and their families who lived up near Machu Picchu and still farmed on its lower terraces when Bingham arrived. Bingham and Arteaga met Toribio Richarte and Anacleto Álvarez on their tough trek up the steep, jungle covered mountain. It was Anacleto’s nine-year-old son, Pablo, who guided Bingham along the last leg of the trek, into the heart of Machu Picchu. While Hiram Bingham certainly deserves the credit for the scientific rediscovery of Machu Picchu, it’s good to see that these locals are at least mentioned at Machu Picchu. But why it took four plaques and 82 years to do so is anyone’s guess.",incas discovery plaques archaeology
477,The Paredones,"Nazca, Peru",These overlooked ruins give an intimate look at the Inca Empire's urban planning prowess.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-paredones-nasca-peru,"Many travelers arrive in Nazca thinking of the area’s namesake culture and its signature archaeological curiosity. But unknown to most, there’s a small site that preserves a trace of another fascinating civilization. The Paredones (“The Walls”) archaeological site, built just outside of modern-day Nazca, was an Inca administrative center built in the 1400s, likely as a link between the coastal and inland settlements. It’s a small site—by no means as awe-inspiring as the civilization’s most famous city—but it’s interesting nonetheless. The thick walls are essentially a set of compressed mud walls built atop a series of terraces. The ruins give visitors a glimpse of the Inca Empire’s highly organized expansion, which saw it establish amazing cities and administrative centers throughout western South America, all while imposing its language and traditions onto the conquered cultures. They’re evidence of the Inca Empire’s control over transportation and urban planning within their expanding realm. Unfortunately, whether due to the original construction materials—rectangular adobe bricks built up on a base of solid stone—or the environment, these ruins are crumbling in places. They haven’t been fully restored, but it also doesn’t take much imagination to envision their original form. A trail leads up and around a small hill past administrative buildings, warehouses, barracks, an observation tower, and a ceremonial area.  To get here you can join a tour, pay a taxi by the hour, or take a dusty walk. The site is at kilometer marker 1 of the Nasca-Puquio Highway (five minutes from Nazca).

478,Jicamarca Ionospheric Radio Observatory,"Lima, Peru",Enormous array of antennae fill a desert valley.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jicamarca-ionospheric-radio-observatory,"The primary instrument at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory is an incoherent scatter radar, a type of atmospheric probe of which there are only a handful in the world. While your ordinary radar system or radio telescope has an appearance similar to a gigantic TV dish, the instrument at Jicamarca takes the form of 18,432 dipole antennae spread over nearly 85,000 square meters of Peruvian desert. Located about 25 kilometers outside the capital city of Lima, the observatory was built from 1960-61 for the purpose of studying the furthest reaches of our planet’s atmosphere. The underlying concept of radar (radio detection and ranging) is simple: a radio wave is transmitted in the direction of a target and the reflection of that wave is analyzed. From the time delay between transmission and reception of the signal, the distance to the object can be determined. And from other characteristics of the reflected signal, various properties of the target itself may also be investigated. At Jicamarca, the target is the ionosphere, the uppermost part of the atmosphere located from about 100 kilometers above the Earth’s surface and beyond. Usually radar targets are discrete, solid objects such as planes or satellites. However, the ionosphere is a rather sparse layer of gas, where the density can drop to a mere 10,000 particles per cubic centimeter. For this reason, the radar at Jicamarca requires both an enormous power output and the utmost sensitivity to record the atmosphere’s weak reflections. While the power of the transmitted signal measures around two million watts (more power than 33,000 sixty watt light bulbs), the strength of the return signal is typically measured in only picowatts. To get an idea, a picowatt is one millionth of a microwatt, which is in turn one millionth of a watt. Put roughly, if the transmitted signal represented an entire beach, the returns would amount to only a few meager grains of sand. The reason why the atmospheric reflections are so weak has to do with the name of the instrument, “incoherent scatter radar.” Through a process known as Thomson scattering, the transmitted radio waves cause electrons in the ionosphere to oscillate and subsequently emit small amounts of energy of their own. This energy constitutes the return signal and the “incoherent” in the instrument’s name comes from the fact that scientists are observing the collective emissions from a group of electrons rather than the energy from one single particle. So, while an incoherent scatter radar might sound like a machine used to produce a random mess of stuff, it is in fact a precise scientific instrument! The Jicamarca observatory is operated by the Geophysical Institute of Peru. As one of the most sensitive atmospheric radars in the world, the Jicamarca instrument can probe the atmosphere up to altitudes of 5000 kilometers and higher. The observatory is about half an hour drive inland (east) from Lima and 10 kilometers from the Central Highway.",observatories retro-tech instruments of science inventions

Standing at three miles above sea level, the rocky path has been used as a highway for the ancient pre-colombian civilizations of Peru for hundreds of years. Miles above the Colca Canyon on the pass to Arequipa, are a series of cairns known as Apachetas. Roughly translated from Quechua, Apacheta means “the source where the flow begins,” and marks high points along the mountain path. However, the real value of Apachetas was spiritual, and the piles were used to commune with a higher power while miles above the sea in the mountains. The cairns were built up as more travelers passed the spot. The stones were picked up and carried along the trail, and then placed on an Apacheta as a sacrifice to the gods. Apachetas were seen as having supernatural powers, and connecting with them through a prayer was said to bring good luck and protection while on the trail. Prayers were often said to Pachamama, the god of the sky, soil and underworld. Those who did not have a rock to carry, often left other belongings behind as a sacrifice. These included coca leaves, shells and even alcohol and sweets. Hundreds of Apachetas were built, and served as altars to guide people along the path. Today, entire fields on the trail between Arequipa and Chivay are covered with the cairns, some stacked shoulder level and higher. Combined with the bizarre Yareta plants that grow along the arid rocks, the trail takes on a seriously martian landscape set to a dramatic background of volcanic mountains.

480,Puente Laguna Garzón,"Maldonado, Uruguay",Because sometimes the most efficient route from A to B isn't a straight line.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/puente-laguna-garzon,"When Uruguay’s Rocha and Maldonado counties sought to replace the tried-and-true way of crossing Laguna Garzón–by single-vehicle float rafts – they leapt straight for a plan that became one of the most immediately recognizable bridges in the world today. After six years of public hearings and negotiations with the local communities, Rafael Viñoly Architects (the same firm responsible for 432 Park Avenue’s delicate tower, the space-age Carrasco Airport, Princeton University’s athletics stadium, and more) found a way to meet the strict needs of the natural and cultural communities connected by the new bridge. The project’s success hinged upon its ability to incorporate the sensitive laws of the area, which, according to primary funder Eduardo Constantini, stipulate that just 35% of the stretch between the lagoons could be developed, while 50% must be devoted to green areas. These prolonged negotiations created a truly forward-thinking piece of engineering, opened to the public in September of 2015. The mile-long Laguna Garzón Bridge is among the most unusual in the world thanks to an empty, near-perfect circle at its center. Born equally of safety concerns – the road’s complementary one-way half-circles force motorists to slow down, thereby breaking up the mile-long stretch that otherwise might have been a tantalizing speedway – and of a need for amusement – it boasts an observation deck-and-fishing pier –  the bridge has already gained international acclaim for its design. Already crossed by more than 1,000 vehicles each day, the bridge is poised to become not only a significant upgrade from the lagoon’s floating predecessor, but is set to become a destination in its own right. Though it cost an estimated $11 million to complete, the bridge that created a “lagoon inside a lagoon” has since linked communities both locally and internationally, while responsibly creating an entry to the surrounding natural world where previously there had been none; in the modern world, where connectivity is everything and returns to nature are so rarely done, you decide whether a few million is a worthy price for such grace.",public works engineering roads infrastructure bridges architecture

Designed by the italian architect Mario Palanti, the building has everything you could imagine, from a cinema to a hotel. The palace was originally topped with a lighthouse with a parabolic mirror of 920mm, reaching approximately 100km, but the light was later removed in favor of an antenna that gave the 27-floor building its eventual height of 100 meters. With this addition it was once thought to be the tallest building in South America, but the antenna has since been removed, demoting it to simply a fantastic display of architecture. Originally intended as a luxury hotel, the palace never managed to fulfill that purpose, and acts instead as a very elaborate collection of private residences and offices. The vast number of rooms in the gothic palace vary in condition and are said to be inhabited by an equally varied clientele. While wandering around the building you can supposedly bump into a three-million-dollar music studio, a radio station, and ladies of the night briskly doing business. Palacio Salvo is like a living organism and a major attraction if you are visiting Montevideo.

The Real de San Carlos complex included not only the bull ring, but a hotel-casino, a ferry dock (for carrying tourists from nearby Buenos Aires), and a huge “pelote basque” building (“fronton”). The casino began operating after the bullfights were forbidden, and the whole complex only operated until 1917. Today only a racetrack from the complex is still in use. Technically, it is forbidden to enter the abandoned bull ring for safety reasons. Update as of December 2021: This location has been renovated and is partially open to the public.",abandoned ruins

Animals like deer, ducks, and capybaras are positioned alongside tools like knives, axes, and saws, all carved from wrought iron by local artist Martin Arregui. The “Zooilógico del Futuro” was inaugurated in 1991 as part of a campaign for the preservation of flora and fauna. The sculpture park, which includes 13 pieces, depicts the dangers of letting indiscriminate hunting and other practices that affect wildlife continue unchecked. The metal sculptures, which are about 10 to 12 feet tall, display various combinations of animals and hand tools, and look a little like a number of shadow puppets merged together. While each sculpture may have more than one animal, they seem to only have one hand tool per sculpture.

485,Teatro Solís,"Montevideo, Uruguay",This beautiful example of neoclassical architecture is one of Uruguay's most treasured cultural gems.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/teatro-solis,"In the early 19th century, the citizens of Montevideo wanted to create a public space to meet and express their social and political ideas. They envisioned a cultural hub unique to South America but rivaling the art and architecture of European city centers. And so the magnificent Teatro Solís was born. The theater was designed by the Italian architect Carlo Zucchi using timber and marble brought over from Europe and stored away while war raged in Uruguay. After years of delay, the theater finally opened in 1856 with a rendition of Verdi’s opera Ernani. Located in Montevideo’s Plaza Independencia, the building is a perfect example of neoclassical, Old World architectural splendor. The design—including the elegant façade (which has been completely restored), carved canopy and pillars, and elliptical interior—was heavily influenced by Italian architecture. The similarities can be seen in the Teatro Carlo in Genoa, the Milanese Teatro alla Scala, and most of all the Teatro Metastasio di Prato near Florence. As Uruguay’s oldest and most renowned cultural theater, Teatro Solís has launched the careers of many Uruguayan actors, singers, and musicians, as well as attracting famous performers from around the world. Headliners over the years include the actresses Sarah Bernhardt, Margarita Xirgú, and Vivien Leigh; tenors Francesco Tamagno and Enrico Caruso; Spanish classical guitarist Andrés Segovia; dancer Isadora Duncan; and pianist Arthur Rubinstein.  Teatro Solís is located on Buenos Aires street at the corner of Bartolome Mitre. The theater is open evenings from Tuesday through Sunday, and closed on Mondays. The venue currently hosts music, operas, plays, comedy, and other performances by Uruguayan and international artists. Guided tours of the theater are also available throughout the day.",performances theaters culture art history architecture
486,Fuente de los Candados,"Montevideo, Uruguay",Where sweethearts leave their love locks in the Uruguayan capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fuente-de-los-candados,"The Fuente de los Candados (Fountain of Locks) is a stone fountain on a street corner in Montevideo. It would be a fairly forgettable fountain under normal circumstances, were it not for the hundreds of padlocks attached to its surrounding railing. When the owners of Bar Facal, one of the most famous restaurants in the city, installed a stone fountain on their street corner, they had no idea it would become one of the city’s most enduring symbols of love. The owners had imported the small fountain, made from volcanic stone, from Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. It sat in storage for 15 years until they finally decided to install it outside the bar, right on the corner of Avenida 18 de Julio and Paseo Yi, a busy spot in the Uruguayan capital. To protect the fountain, a metal railing was erected all around it. And soon, something strange began to happen. Padlocks started to appear, attached to the railing and typically inscribed with the initials of two people. Initially, the owners of Bar Facal were baffled by this, but a bit of research revealed the cause: The fountain had contracted a serious case of the love locks. This international phenomenon had struck bridges, gates, fences and monuments across the globe—a symbol of love for sweethearts, but the bane of many a municipal authority. And now it had arrived in Montevideo. The owners of Bar Facal were happy to let people place locks on the fountain’s fence (it was good for business, after all), and soon it was covered in hundreds of padlocks left primarily by loved-up tourists who were familiar with the craze. After a while, the owners decided to put a plaque by the fountain, explaining, in Spanish and English, the “legend” of the “young fountain,” and how any lock placed here with the initials of the two lovers would ensure their love lasts forever.  The Fuente de los Candados is located on the corner of 18 de Julio and Paseo Yi in the Centro district of Montevideo, outside Bar Facal. If you want to buy a lock, ask in the nearby kiosk.",love locks love fountains shops
487,Fortaleza del Cerro,"Montevideo, Uruguay",This historic fort overlooks Montevideo and appears on Uruguay’s coat of arms.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortaleza-del-cerro,"Fortaleza del Cerro sits atop the highest hill in Montevideo. For more than a century, it has looked over the city and the bay, a witness to many of the events that have shaped the Uruguayan capital. In 1806, British forces began prowling the Río de la Plata, an estuary between Argentina and Uruguay controlled by the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty. The British invaded and occupied Buenos Aires in June of that year, captured the city of Montevideo in February 1807, and again invaded Buenos Aires a few months later. None of these attempts at taking permanent control of Spanish possessions along the Río de la Plata were ultimately successful, but they certainly made the Spanish rethink their defenses. In 1809, Francisco Javier de Elío, a Spanish soldier and then governor of Montevideo, ordered the construction of fortifications on top of Cerro de Montevideo. At 433 feet (132 meters) above sea level, the summit of Cerro de Montevideo offered a strategic vantage point above the city and overlooking the bay. It was also home to a lighthouse, built in 1802, which itself served an important role not only for navigation but for sending warning messages to ships out at sea using a system of flags. Initially, only a limited set of simple fortifications were to be built around the lighthouse. But the need to defend the bay required more than a lighthouse, and so the Spanish decided to build a fortress whose walls could accommodate larger artillery pieces. Construction of the fort began in 1809 and was finished in 1811. The first artillery test took place on February 25, 1811, with the new fortress firing its four cannons and two howitzers out into the bay. It was not long until the Fortaleza del Cerro became embroiled in the colonial struggles of the era. Cities and settlements along the Río de la Plata had been rising up against their colonial overloads since the May Revolution of 1810 in Buenos Aires. In 1814, patriot troops besieged Montevideo and took it from the Spanish loyalists, marking the end of the Spanish presence in Uruguay (and also making the Fortaleza del Cerro the last Spanish fort built in the country). But Uruguay’s fight for independence was far from over. In January 1817, the fortress was overwhelmed when a force of 10,000 Portuguese troops took Montevideo, and the Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil took control of Uruguay. The Brazilian Empire then became independent of Portugal in 1822, and the Brazilians found themselves in charge of Montevideo. Patriot forces again surrounded Montevideo in 1825, and took the fortress from the Brazilians on February 9, 1826. In 1828, Uruguay was officially recognized as an independent state. A year later it adopted a new coat of arms, with the Fortaleza del Cerro featured in its upper right quarter. Then came the Uruguayan Civil War, known as the Guerra Grande, which lasted from 1839 to 1851. The fort never fell during this period, but the lighthouse was damaged and later repaired. The next major event in this lengthy period of change and uncertainty came in 1870, when the fort was taken during the Revolución de las Lanzas (Revolution of the Lances), an armed movement led by Timoteo Aparicio, leader of the National Party of Uruguay. The taking of the fortress during this last conflict raised doubts as to its continued effectiveness in defense of the city. In 1885, Máximo Santos, then President of Uruguay, ordered a feigned attack on the fortress as a test of its abilities. Unfortunately, no one told the garrison about this, and the fortress opened up with live fire on what it assumed were hostile forces. Luckily for all involved, no one was killed in the messy incident. That was pretty much the end of the Fortaleza del Cerro’s role as a functioning military fortress. It served as a military prison from 1895 to 1907, and was declared a National Monument in 1931. A military museum was established inside the fort in 1939, and since then its primary role has been as a tourist attraction, a fittingly tranquil retirement for a fort with a long and turbulent history.  Fortaleza del Cerro, also known as Fortaleza General Artigas, is located on a hill just to the west of Montevideo and across the bay from Cuidad Vieja (the Old Town). You can get there by taking bus 124 or 125 from the city center, which will drop you off at the Terminal Cerro, from where you can take a taxi, take the 18L bus, or walk to the fort. The fort is open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the summer, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in winter. The entrance fee is 20 Uruguayan pesos, which is less than $1 US.",

The island is located along the outer limit of the Rio de la Plata estuary and belongs to a natural reserve with Gorriti Island. The island was known to the first Spanish explorers in the area around the 16th-century. In 1858, the Uruguayan government built the first lighthouse on the island, which was restored in 1906 and was turned into the country’s first automated lighthouse in 2001. Since 1992, the island has become part of the Coastal Islands National Park in order to protect the local fauna. The island is home to the largest colony of sea lions and fur seals in the southern and western hemispheres. In a 2005 census, over 1,500 sea lions and 250,000 fur seals were counted on Isla de Lobos. While these animals are clearly the main population of the area, other species visit the island as well such as elephant seals and various species of birds. In addition, the island is a whale-watching spot, as Southern right whales often pass by the area when wintering around the Uruguayan coast.

489,Grutas del Palacio,"Flores, Uruguay",This wonderful rock formation constitutes the first geopark in Uruguay.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grutas-del-palacio,"The Gruta del Palacio (“Palace Cave”) is an ancient rock formation located in Central Uruguay, near the small town of Trinidad. This wonderful geological feature is composed of sandstone and sedimentary rock. The natural wonder formed around 70 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period, later solidifying into its current appearance during the Paleocene. The peculiar cave is formed by an upper shell of sandstone sustained by multiple 6.5 feet (2-meters) tall natural columns that create a structure that resembles the porticoes of palaces, hence the name. These features create a large labyrinth of caves, of which only a small portion is accessible to the public. It has been suggested that the caves could have been inhabited by the indigenous population of the region during prehistoric times. Some local legends are linked to this rock formation, but no definitive proof of ancient human presence has been found. First studied in 1877, the caves were explored during the 20th-century, and in 2013, the site became the first geopark in Uruguay and the second in all of South America.

491,Estadio Centenario,"Montevideo, Uruguay",This historic stadium was built to host the first-ever FIFA World Cup.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/estadio-centenario,"Built to host the first-ever FIFA World Cup in 1930, Montevideo’s Estadio Centenario is today considered one of the most historic soccer stadiums in the world. When the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) announced plans to hold the first World Cup in 1930, six countries applied to host the event: Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Uruguay. Despite being the only non-European country to apply, Uruguay won the bid. At the time, the Uruguayan national team was a soccer powerhouse and the reigning Olympic champion. The country would also celebrate 100 years of independence in 1930, a historic landmark not lost on FIFA. But not everyone was keen on holding the inaugural World Cup in South America, especially the Europeans. Of the 13 nations that took part, nine were from the Americas. Many European nations rejected invitations because of the three-week voyage required to get to South America. And some were simply appalled that the inaugural event wasn’t being held in Europe. England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, meanwhile, had withdrawn from FIFA in 1928 due to a dispute over payments to amateur players, and so were ineligible (although six British born players did manage to get into the USA team). In the end, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, and Romania were the only Old World nations to attend. In 1929, while FIFA worked on the attendance issue, Uruguay had a pressing problem of its own: Where exactly was it going to host the event? A handful of small stadiums already existed in Montevideo, but something larger was required. And so, in 1929, workers, many of whom were immigrants, began construction on the 90,000-capacity Estadio Centenario, named in honor of the country’s 100 years of independence. It was completed in just nine months, but that was still five days too late. The rainy season and a hectic construction schedule had caused delays, and so the opening matches of the inaugural World Cup took place at Estadio Parque Central and Estadio Pocitos, which at the time had capacities of 20,000 and 1,000 respectively. After a frustrating few days, Estadio Centenario—at the time the largest football stadium outside the British Isles— finally hosted its first-ever match. It was a positive start, with Uruguay beating Peru 1-0. The stadium went on to host 10 of the 18 matches in the World Cup, including both semi-finals and the final. And on July 30, 1930, Uruguay won the first ever FIFA World Cup when they defeated Argentina 4-2 in the final. Estadio Centenario has remained the home ground of the Uruguayan national team ever since that triumphant beginning. It has also hosted the Copa América on four occasions. As the stadium is not owned by a club, other clubs can rent it for big games. As such, it often hosts high-profile national club matches and home-turf encounters in the Copa Libertadores. On July 18, 1983, FIFA declared the Estadio Centenario a “Historical Monument of World Football,” the only stadium in the world to hold this title. Since its inauguration in 1930, the stadium hasn’t changed all that much. The capacity has dropped to around 60,000 as standing areas have been replaced with seating, and the stadium now houses the Museo de Futbol, a museum dedicated to the history of Uruguayan football. Apart from that, it has largely remained the same. That, however, could change in the not too distant future. Uruguay wants to host the 2030 World Cup, 100 years after it hosted the inaugural event, so any bid it makes will have the weight of history behind it. But to strengthen the bid, Uruguay will need to invest in the national stadium. In April 2018, Uruguay’s sports secretary Fernando Caceres announced that six projects were being considered for a new stadium. In each of these proposals, the iconic 328-foot Tower of Tributes that rises up from the stadium’s Olympic Tribune stand will be preserved. Some of the proposals, however, require the demolition of the stadium to make room for a new one, an idea that hasn’t been ruled out by Caceres. Understandably, many Uruguayans are vehemently opposed to this idea.  Estadio Centenario is located in the Parque Batlle neighborhood in central Montevideo. You can get there by taking any bus to the Tres Cruces bus terminal, from where it’s a 10- to 15-minute walk to the stadium. From the historic center, you can catch bus 115 or 143 and get off at the corner of Av. Dr. Americo Ricaldoni and Av. Italia, right next to the stadium. Check local listings for events, including soccer matches and concerts. The Museo de Futbol is open Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.",world cup anniversary soccer sports history
492,Mausoleo de Artigas,"Montevideo, Uruguay",The remains of Uruguayan hero José Artigas lie beneath a monument in Montevideo’s main square.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mausoleo-de-artigas,"In the center of Montevideo’s main square stands an imposing statue of José Artigas, one of Uruguay’s most celebrated national heroes. And beneath this statue lies his mausoleum, dutifully protected by a guard of honor. At the center of Plaza Independencia, the most important square in the capital city, you’ll find a bronze equestrian statue of Artigas, the soldier and revolutionary leader who is regarded as the father of Uruguayan independence. The statue stands atop a large, grey granite base, the entire monument weighing 30 tons and reaching a height of 56 feet. You can’t miss it when you enter the plaza, but you might miss what’s hidden beneath it: the Mausoleo de Artigas, an underground chamber that holds the remains of the revolutionary leader. The mausoleum was inaugurated in 1977 during the de facto presidency of Aparicio Méndez, a non-democratically elected politician who rose to power during the civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay. Understandably, there was no shortage of irony when a political figure like Méndez inaugurated the mausoleum of a soldier who fought for freedom and democracy. And because the mausoleum was opened during a dictatorship, the tomb itself is conspicuously short of the quotes that Artigas was so famous for. The interior walls of the somber, dimly lit mausoleum are covered with inscriptions in reference to the events of Artigas’ life, but his actual words were deemed too inflammatory by the dictatorship, and so none appear in the mausoleum. At the heart of the mausoleum stands the urn containing the remains of Artigas, housed in glass and illuminated from above. Day and night, the remains are guarded by the Blandengues de Artigas, a military regiment named in honor of Artigas in 1910. Two Blandengues always stand on guard at either side of the urn, watching over the hallowed resting place of Uruguay’s national hero.  The Mausoleo de Artigas is located beneath the Artigas Monument at the center of Plaza Independencia, which lies between the Ciudad Vieja (Old City) and downtown Montevideo. Two black granite staircases lead down to the mausoleum on opposing sides of the monument. Visiting hours are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

Designed by soldiers, the project was placed on-hold due to the outbreak of civil war. Work wasn’t officially completed until 1857. Built-in 1690, the Convent of San Francisco Javier was close to the waterfront of this Portuguese settlement. The chapel’s tower served as an important landmark for boats navigating the Rio de la Plata. In 1705, the convent was destroyed by a fire, however, all was not lost. Eventually, the tower was reconstructed to create the lighthouse. The remaining convent walls added structural stability and are still visible today. The Rio de la Plata is actually an estuary formed by the confluence of the Paraná and Uruguay Rivers. Both are important trade routes connecting much of central South America to the outside world. Strong winds from the Atlantic have caused many shipwrecks, so many that the Rio de la Plata has been called “the hell of sailor’s” and is known as a naval graveyard.

495,The Drowned Church of Potosi,"Uribante, Venezuela",A town church once nearly submerged by the damming of a river is now hauntingly visible as the water recedes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drowned-church-potosi,"Between 1985 and 2008, fishermen and daytrippers traveling by boat along the lake formed by the Uribante Reservoir in Táchira, Venezuela would be presented with an unusual and eerie sight: a lone and mildewed cross rising crookedly out of the water, clearly attached to a foundation leading to something anchoring it – something big, deep beneath the surface. In 2008 however, the cross started to rise higher and higher out of the water, revealing more of the gothic structure below. The unsettling cross was literally just the tip of something much more massive. In reality, the structure was not rising out of the water, but rather the water of the reservoir was receding, revealing what the lake had concealed for more than two decades. By 2010, the water had receded almost entirely, revealing a large stretch of flat land, and a towering gothic church that was once nearly submerged. The church belonged to the city of Potosi, which in 1985 was purposefully flooded by the damming of a nearby river to create hydroelectric power. All of Potosi’s citizens had to be relocated, their homes and town abandoned, and for 20 years all that remained of their former life was the cross at the top of the church’s steeple, once reaching high into the sky, and then brought down to earth and nearly – but not completely – drowned. It’s not uncommon for a city to be flooded by the building of a dam. St. Thomas, Nevada now rests at the bottom of Lake Mead near Las Vegas. The same happened to Vilarinho das Furnas, a 2,000-year-old city in Portugal. Other times, it’s a natural disaster that dams a nearby river unexpectedly, as it did with the Thistle ghost town in Utah; or the ocean rises and simply never recedes, which caused sunken pirate city of Port Royal, Jamaica. Less common is the phenomenon of a building, in this case the steeple of a single church, remaining above the surface of the water. It has long been remarkable, and a powerful symbol for some, that the cross adorning the top of this structure remained proudly above the surface, marking the location of the former city. However, severe droughts and water shortages in Venezuela have resulted in the effective draining of the reservoir, revealing the church once again. Erosion and water damage makes it look ancient and wild, and although the impressive facade and steeple remain, the body of the church has been worn away, resulting in the haunting effect of seeing a church which appears to be whole and beautiful from the front, only to reveal that it is gutted and empty from the side. For years the cross emerging out of the water has been symbolic for the spirit of a town washed away, and now the revealed and hollowed church provides an eerie metaphor for a town that had its citizens removed.",flooded towers underwater week lost tribes cultures and civilizations subterranean sites sacred spaces ruins architectural oddities architecture
496,Relampago del Catatumbo,Venezuela,This everlasting lightning storm may be the world's largest generator of ozone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/relampago-del-catatumbo,"There’s something strange in the air where the Catatumbo River flows into Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela… For 140 to 160 nights out of the year, for 10 hours at a time, the sky above the river is pierced by almost constant lightning, producing as many as 280 strikes per hour. Known as the “Relámpago del Catatumbo,” (relámpago means lightning in Spanish) this lightning storm has been raging, on and off, for as long as people can remember. The area has been labeled as the most electric place on Earth and it even made it to the Guinness Book of World Records. It was first written about in the 1597 poem “The Dragontea” by Lope de Vega. De Vega tells of Sir Francis Drake’s 1595 attempt to take the city of Maracaibo by night, only to have his plans foiled when the lightning storm’s flashes gave away his position to the city’s defenders. This happened again on July 24, 1823, when, during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Spanish ships were revealed by the lightning and defeated by the Simón Bolívar’s upstart navy. In fact, the lightning, visible from 400 kilometers away, is so regular that it’s been used as a navigation aid by ships and is known among sailors as the “Maracaibo Beacon.” Interestingly, generally little to no sound accompanies this fantastic light show, as the lightning moves from cloud to cloud—far, far above the ground. For many years, it was unknown exactly why this area—and this area alone—should produce such regular lightning. One theory held that ionized methane gas rising from the Catatumbo bogs met with storm clouds coming down from the Andes, helping to create the perfect conditions for a lightning storm. Now, though, scientists attribute the lightning to a regular, low-lying air current coming from the Caribbean; they’ve set up an early warning system based on forecasts of when lightning storms will come. The highest concentration of lightning strikes can be usually observed in October, and the lowest in January and February. With a total of roughly 1.2 million lightning discharges per year, the Relampago del Catatumbo is thought to be the world’s greatest producer of ozone. As the lightning rips through the air, it produces nitrogen oxide, which is broken down by sunlight and converted into ozone. It is unclear, however, whether these molecules ever end up in the protective ozone layer high above the planet.",lightning weird weather phenomena electricity weather lakes

Mount Roraima is surrounded by three different countries (Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana) whose borderlines intersect on the massive shelf, with all four sides being sheer 400-meter high cliffs. While its cliff walls are only scalable by the most experienced of climbers, there is a path up the mountain’s natural ramp-like path (usually a two-day hike). However, the mountain is worth a visit for more reasons than its impressive cliffs. Mount Roraima, part of Venezuela’s 30000-square-kilometer Canaima National Park, is the site of the highest peak of the country of Guyana’s Highland Range. The mountains of this range, including Roraima, are considered to be some of the oldest geological formations known, some dating back to two billion years ago. Its near daily rains have also created a unique ecosystem which includes several endemic species, such as a unique carnivorous pitcher plant, and some of the highest waterfalls in the world. Culturally, the mountain has long held significance to the indigenous people of the area and features prominently in their myths and folklore.

499,Sarisarinama,"Sucre, Venezuela",Massive sinkholes on a mountain in one of the most remote places in Venezuela.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarisarinama,"Besides being one of the most remote locations in all of Venezuela, Sarisarinama is one of the most bizarre landscapes in the world. High in the clouds on a tepui, or tabletop mountain, are four giant sinkholes, each a near-perfect circle, cutting through the foliage-covered mountain. The largest of the sinkholes is 1150 feet wide and 1000 feet deep. Although the other three well-known holes are not quite as large, they are equally impressive and drop off in the midst of the primeval forest on top of the tepui. Adding to the mystery of the place is the local legend that gave the tepui its name. According to natives to the area, a flesh-eating evil spirit lived on the mountain, who made the sound Sari Sari when he was consuming human meat. Although there are not any actual person-eating spirits on the mountain, the desolation atop the mountain still adds a level of eeriness to the surroundings. Having only recently been introduced to the sinkholes on Sarisarinama, visitors to the area are often shocked at how the dense jungle pushes all the way to the edge of the sinkholes, making their presence more dramatic and even more unnerving. Since the holes were spotted in 1961, many expeditions into the jungle have occurred. Whether cursed by spirits or just unprepared for the harsh jungle landscape, many of these have ended in disaster, including one fateful mission in which a number of men became trapped after lowering themselves into one of the larger sinkholes. Considering the thickness of the jungle and the dangerous unknowns of Sarisarinama, forays into the area are not recommended without a guide, and a bit of luck to keep yourself from falling 1000 feet into one of the massive sinkholes.",martian landscapes subterranean sites caves ecosystems
500,Dr. Gottfried Knoche and his mummies,"Caracas, Venezuela",Ruins of the laboratory where a mysterious doctor invented an embalming fluid and stored his mummies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dr-gottfried-knoche-and-his-mummies,"Gottfried Knoche, born in Halberstadt , Germany in 1813, was a German surgeon famous for inventing an embalming fluid with which he created dozens of mummified bodies… including his own. Knoche emigrated from Germany to Venezuela in 1840 to settle in La Guaira. There he embedded himself in the coastal population and founded the San Juan de Dios Hospital sometime between 1854 and 1856. Once settled, Knoche brought his wife and began work in the city as a doctor. The doctor quickly gained a reputation as a charitable person by caring for poor patients without charge while tirelessly fighting against the cholera epidemic that afflicted the region in those years. Knoche’s fascination and persistence in avoiding the inexorable process of bodies decomposing after death, he began to experiment with unclaimed bodies from the federal war (not a terribly unusual practice for physicians of the time), returning them on horseback from San Juan de Dios hospital to his laboratory located in the Hacienda Buena Vista, at the Palmar del Picacho in Galipán. Over time Knoche created a liquid that could be injected into corpses that would keep the body pristine without necessitating the removal of their organs. In this fashion, the doctor kept several bodies mummified for study in his laboratory. Knoche had anticipated the arrival of his own death, and made sure that Amalie Weismann, his nurse in charge of administering the “mummification serum” (embalming fluid, as we know it today) to the bodies, had prepared doses for his own infinite preservation. He then apparently had Amalie inject it into his still living body before locking himself in a mausoleum for all eternity. Dr. Thomas Lander, a famous Venezuelan journalist and politician, and Francisco Linares Alcántara, president of Venezuela from 1878-1879 were both said to have been preserved by Knoche. The mummy of Landers theoretically sat in the entrance of the Landers house for some 40 years before he was buried. In 1929 an expedition to the Knoche family farm found that many of the mummies had been removed from their niches and were scattered on the ground. A picture was taken at the time prominently featuring one of these mummies. Amelie, the doctor’s faithful nurse and aide, followed Knoche to his grave in 1926. Ever since, the Knoche’s homestead has been slowly engulfed by vegetation and pillaged by vandals, looters and medical students either seeking the secret of the embalming fluid or attracted by the myth of this dark work. Some of the exterior walls, door frames of the main entrance, stables, a tank, the laboratory and oven are all that remain. To this day, the exact composition of the substance used by Knoche to preserve his corpses has never been discovered. The closest scientists have come to approximating the concoction has been a potent solution based on aluminum chloride.",mummies memento mori ruins

502,The Helix,"Caracas, Venezuela",This former shopping center now acts as the eccentric lair of the Venezuelan secret police and their shadow prison.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-helix-caracas-venezuela,"Rising up out of the Venezuelan slums, the eye-catching complex known as The Helix (El Helicoide) looks like something out of a super-villain’s dream and with its intelligence headquarters, mysterious prison, and general air of secrecy, it acts the part as well. Designed to be an ultra-modern retail destination, construction began on the Helix complex in 1956. The tiered shopping center was set to have a five-star hotel, a park, and floors of luxury shopping. The massive mall would have allowed people to drive their cars right into the complex and park right near the shops they wanted to visit. Built on a pre-existing hill in Caracas, the pyramid-like structure jutted impressively from the surrounding neighborhood. Unfortunately funding for the project ran dry in the 1960’s and work on the site slowed to a trickle despite the inclusion of a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome which was placed like a cap atop the hill. Eventually the Helix was completed as six concentric levels of the building were built onto the shelves carved out of the hill. With the dream of an easily accessible mecca of retail and luxury scuttled due to money woes, the Venezuelan state began using the space for a number of its agencies. This centralization of government power led to a damaging bombing in 1992. However the structure was rebuilt and the whole complex is now home to the Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services (DISIP). This secretive intelligence agency headquarters in the eccentric building and has also started a not-so-secret prison at the site. Like many such facilities, the prisoners are often held without charge and have reported myriad human rights abuses from within the iconic building. In the real world, most shady government agencies try to remain under the radar, but the shadow agents of The Helix seem to have taken a page from a different book.

503,Mount Roraima Tripoint Marker,"Santa Elena de Uairén, Venezuela","A pyramidal marker where the borders of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana meet on top of Mount Roraima.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-roraima-tripoint-marker,"Signs of human activity are hard to come by on the plateau of Mount Roraima, a sandstone tepui, or table-top mountain, that rises out of the jungle below. But on the mesa sits a small man-made marker that marks that spot at which the borders of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana meet. The 12-square-mile summit area of Mount Roraima was unexplored until 1884. What at first appeared to be a barren landscape above the teeming jungle was soon discovered to harbor many fascinating plants that had adapted to the environment, dotted with caves and canyons. One of the rare signs of a human activity on the tepui (meaning “house of the gods” in the native Pemon language) is a whitewashed stone pyramidal structure. About seven feet tall, the marker sits on the tripoint where the borders of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana all meet. The Mount Roraima tripoint marker was erected during a joint expedition between Venezuela, Brazil and British Guiana in 1931 (Guyana achieved its independence from the United Kingdom on May 26, 1966). One side of the marker is clearly marked with the word “Brasil” and the nation’s national shield, and the other with “Venezuela.” The Venezuelan side also bears a bronze plaque and the geographical marker “BV-0,” referring to the zero point between the two national boundaries (with no mention of Guyana). The Guyanese side, meanwhile, is almost blank save for some barely legible and crudely done lettering (you can see it in this 360-degree image). Even this isolated table-top mountain couldn’t escape political squabbling. Venezuela and Guyana have been engaged in a long-running border dispute stemming from Venezuela’s claims to the western portion of Guyana, which it claims as the Venezuelan region of Guayana Esequiba (and which, if recognized internationally, would push Guyana off the top of Mount Roraima and then some). Hence the “BV-0” and Venezuela’s stanch lack of recognition of Guyana’s place on the tripiont marker. But as things stand, any adventurous soul who manages to reach the summit area of Mount Roraima can wrap his or her arms around the tripoint marker and claim to be in three different countries at once.  The only non-technical route to the top of Mount Roraima is via the Paraitepui route from Venezuela. All other approaches involve climbing gear and a healthy dose of experience. Tour companies organize six-day guided hikes to the summit from the nearby town of Santa Elena de Uairen in Venezuela. If you hate trekking and have money to burn, it's possible to charter a helicopter up to the plateau.",
504,Tower of David,"Caracas, Venezuela",The world's tallest slum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tower-of-david,"At 45 stories, the Torre de David, or Tower of David, in Caracas, Venezuela is the world’s tallest slum. Officially called the Centro Financiero Confinanzas, the skyscraper was originally going to be a bank. Construction started in 1990, but with the Venezuelan banking crisis, as well as the unexpected death of developer J. David Brillembourg (whose name was taken to grace the building), the work stopped in 1994. After that, it was abandoned, until in 2007 when squatters moved in. While the Tower of David is often seen as a hotbed for crime, it is home for around 2,500 individuals. With a pooled rent, they’ve created their own electrical grid and aqueduct in a building that is still basically a concrete shell, and which was never intended for residential use. However, despite the community that was formed there in response to the ongoing housing crisis, there is always the danger of the towering height from the unfinished floors and walls that gape over the city. Update: In 2014, the inhabitants of the tower were evicted and moved to various government housings around the city.

505,Esfera Caracas,"Caracas, Venezuela",One of the most iconic sculptures in Caracas looks like a large orange ball suspended in the air.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/esfera-caracas,"The Esfera Caracas, or Caracas Sphere, is a kinetic sculpture made from a series of aluminum rods, which together form what looks like a large orange ball hanging in the air. In 1994, the acclaimed Venezuelan sculptor and painter Jesús Soto began making inquiries about one of his sculptures, which had seemingly disappeared. The piece—a kinetic sculpture resembling an orange sphere—had been commissioned by the Federal District Governor’s Office, but had never seen the light of day. With the help of some friends in high places, Soto, famous for his op art and kinetic works, began the hunt. At the time, Venezuela was going through a rough patch. Hugo Chávez was in prison after an unsuccessful coup d’état, and the collapse of Banco Latino had created a banking crisis. Finding a lost piece of art wasn’t a priority, but Soto and his friends eventually found it in a government storage space. The problem now was where to put it. In the end, it was the First Lady of Venezuela at the time, Alicia Pietri, who found a place for the sculpture. Pietri, a dedicated patron of the arts, childcare, and urban improvement, had found a spot along the Francisco Fajardo Highway, not far from La Casona (the official presidential residence) and a nearby airbase. And so the Esfera Caracas finally had a home. It was inaugurated in 1997 and soon became a cultural icon of Caracas. Like other works by Soto, the Esfera Caracas is a dynamic piece whose appearance differs depending on the viewer, as well as the elements. The sculpture is made from 1,800 three-quarter-inch hollow aluminum rods, suspended from a 39-foot-tall metal gantry on a concrete base. The suspended orange-colored rods create what appears to be a sphere suspended in the air, which seems to move or shimmer with changes in the light and the wind. For eight years, the Esfera Caracas stood along the highway, a famous landmark for people driving by. But in 2005, vandals began to destroy the piece. The lack of lighting at night, the absence of any watchmen or caretakers, and the ease of access to the sculpture made it an easy target, and soon the vandals had stripped away most of the aluminum rods. The frame stood all but bare, a sorry sight indeed. Soto had died earlier that same year, but the Soto Foundation, along with the cultural association PDVSA La Estancia, was determined to save the Esfera Caracas. Since much of the sculpture had been stolen, however, the only option was to go the Ship of Theseus route and rebuild the sculpture rod by rod. And while they were at it, the restoration team added new security features, a modern lighting system, and a new garden. Soto’s sphere had been reborn. In 2014, another problem arose. The widening of the Francisco Fajardo Highway and the construction of the new La Carlota Bridge meant that the Esfera Caracas had to be moved. So the whole thing was disassembled and reassembled 1,500 yards further along the highway, to a slightly higher location that offered better views of the sphere. And that’s where the Esfera Caracas stands today, its orange sphere shimmering by day and by night, one of the most iconic sculptures in Caracas and arguably the most famous work by the late Jesús Soto.  The Esfera Caracas is located along the Francisco Fajardo Highway, between Aeropuerto Francisco de Miranda and Generalísimo Francisco de Miranda Park. The sphere is actually in a space in the middle of the highway, so walking there isn’t ideal. You can, however, pull off the highway and park in the small parking lot near the sphere, after which you can explore and take photos at your leisure.",kinetics installations sculptures art

507,General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge,"Maracaibo, Venezuela","Once considered a marvel of engineering, there are now doubts about the structural integrity of this 5.4-mile cable-stayed bridge.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/general-rafael-urdaneta-bridge,"The General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge was considered a marvel of modern bridge design when it opened in 1962. A few years prior, the government of Venezuela held a competition calling for designs for a bridge across the Tablazo Strait of Lake Maracaibo. Twelve entries were submitted, but in the end it was the design of the innovative Italian civil engineer Riccardo Morandi that won the contract. Morandi was known for his use of reinforced and prestressed concrete, and his proposal was the only concrete design of the 12 entries. It was also the first of what would become his signature cable-stayed bridges. To the layperson, a cable-stayed bridge looks similar to a suspension bridge. But a cable-stayed bridge has cables (or stays) that run directly from the tower to the bridge deck, whereas a suspension bridge uses cables suspended vertically from a main cable to support the deck. To cross the Tablazo Strait, Morandi’s bridge would have to be exceptionally long. And, once completed, the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge had a total length of 5.4 miles, with five main spans supported from six 302-feet-tall towers, providing a clearance of 151 feet to the water below. That clearance, however, was not enough to prevent an oil tanker from crashing into the bridge just two years after its completion. On April 6, 1964, the supertanker Esso Maracaibo lost steering due to a major electrical failure, and minutes later crashed into the bridge. An 850-feet section of the bridge collapsed into the water along with four vehicles, killing seven people. It could have been an even greater tragedy had there been fires or explosions on the tanker. It was carrying 236,000 barrels of crude oil at the time, but no spill occurred. The bridge was repaired, with no damage done to the reputation of its designer, Morandi. It was still considered a marvelous design, and in 2001 the French structural engineer and bridge specialist Dr. Michel Virlogeux wrote that “the Lake Maracaibo Bridge [General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge] deserves to be part of the series of the most famous bridges over the world, with the Golden Gate Bridge, the bridge over the Firth of Forth, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Garabit Viaduct.” In recent years, however, concerns have been raised regarding the structural integrity of the aging bridge. One notable issue with the bridge is the weighing system, which according to some reports hasn’t worked for years, and as such is not calculating the weight of cargo vehicles—not a good situation for a bridge that carries around 40,000 vehicles a day. Then, on August 14, 2018, the Morandi Bridge in Genoa, Italy, collapsed, sending vehicles crashing to the ground 150 feet below and killing 43 people. The bridge had been designed by Riccardo Morandi, the same man behind the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge in Venezuela. And both were cable-stayed bridges made of prestressed concrete. Understandably, concerns surrounding Morandi’s Venezuelan bridge have since skyrocketed. The investigation into the collapse of the Morandi Bridge in Genoa is ongoing, and the bridge itself will be demolished rather than rebuilt. The future of the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge, meanwhile, remains very much in the balance, and its days may well be numbered. Plans are already underway for the construction of a second bridge across Lake Maracaibo.  The General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge crosses over the Tablazo Strait outlet of Lake Maracaibo in western Venezuela, connecting the city of Maracaibo with the major highways heading east to Barquisimeto and Caracas.",engineering bridges design
508,Monumento Manto de María,"Barquisimeto, Venezuela",This unique depiction of the Virgin Mary may be the tallest kinetic art sculpture in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monumento-manto-de-maria,"The Monumento Manto de María in Venezuela may be the tallest kinetic sculpture in the world, and also the tallest statue of the Virgin Mary. But like the work itself, it all depends on your point of view. In July 2014, a group of Venezuelan architects began work on the large monument in the city of Barquisimeto, some 160 miles west of Caracas. The artwork was to be a representation of the Divina Pastora (Divine Shepherdess), a religious icon of the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus, and the patron saint of the city. But rather than build a standard statue of stone or sheets of metal, the architects decided to utilize kinetic art, a sculptural style popular in Venezuela. Completed in 2016, the image of the Virgin Mary was created using 3,772 pieces of aluminum tubing, forming a total of 522 tubes that create the image itself. As you move around the monument—which is located on a 131-foot hill and is visible from miles away—the image falls in and out of focus, and can only be seen clearly from certain angles. The tubes that create the image are suspended from a massive concrete frame that surrounds the figure. The structure has a total height of 203 feet, while the image of the Virgin Mary reaches a height of 155 feet—and that’s enough to potentially put the Monumento Manto de María into the record books, twice. Not only does the monument have a claim to be the tallest kinetic art sculpture on the planet it might also be the world’s largest statue of the Virgin Mary. Singapore had previously laid claim to the world’s largest kinetic art sculpture, in the form of Kinetic Rain, an 810-square-foot sculpture found in Changi Airport. But the Monumento Manto de María dwarfs Kinetic Rain. As for being the world’s largest statue of the Virgin Mary, some might argue that the Monumento Manto de María isn’t really a statue in the traditional sense. But the people of Barquisimeto hardly care about that. For them, the monument is a source of great pride; one that can be seen from across the city and beyond.  The Monumento Manto de María is located on a hill just to the east of the city of Barquisimeto, which is the capital of the Lara state of Venezuela. Visitors can walk up the concrete towers at either side of the monument, scaling the 296 steps and stopping at four different mezzanines on the way up or down. From the top you’ll have impressive views across Barquisimeto and Cabudare just to the south. The monument is normally open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., but the hours have changed quite often since it was opened, so check before you go.

509,Flor de Venezuela,"Barquisimeto, Venezuela",This iconic pavilion in Barquisimeto has a roof made from 16 “petals” that open and close depending on the weather.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flor-de-venezuela,"When Venezuela went to the Expo 2000 World’s Fair in Hanover, it wanted to present the theme of “Venezuela! A Flower for the World.” Its pavilion, therefore, was designed to represent a flower with 16 huge petals that open and close. The Flor de Venezuela, also known as the Flor de Hanover, was designed by the acclaimed Venezuelan architect Fruto Vivas. Vivas took his inspiration from the tepuis, or table-top mountains, that rise up in the Gran Sabana, and more directly from the national flower of Venezuela, the orchid. The pavilion was designed and built for the Expo 2000, a World’s Fair held in Hanover, Germany, and its kinetic, naturalistic design certainly caught the attention of passersby. The roof of the glass building was made using 16 petals, each at least 33 feet (10 m) long, attached to a central mast in the glass-fronted building. A hydraulic system allows the petals of the artificial flower to open and close, a function that isn’t only aesthetic: when the weather turns, the flower can be closed to keep out the wind and rain. After the Expo 2000, the Flor de Venezuela was moved in stages to the city of Barquisimeto in the northwest of Venezuela, about 160 miles (260 km) west of Caracas. It took time, however, and the pavilion was finally inaugurated in its current location in 2008, under state ownership. The three exhibition levels of the 60-feet-high pavilion are accessed by a central spiral stairway (or elevator). Visitors walk up through the levels, where thousands of plants and numerous aquariums display the country’s biological diversity. There’s also a library and small amphitheater for shows and exhibitions. And at night, the whole building is illuminated, creating one of the most iconic landmarks in the city, and one officially recognized as part of the Cultural Patrimony of Venezuela.  The Flor de Venezuela is located at the intersection of Avenida Venezuela and Avenida Bracamonte, just to the east of downtown Barquisimeto. Entrance is free unless there’s a special event taking place. The pavilion is open Tuesday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.",
510,Embrace of Bolívar and Morillo,"Santa Ana, Venezuela",The monument marks where Simón Bolívar and his Spanish adversary Pablo Morillo met to have a drink together.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/embrace-of-bolivar-and-morillo,"This monument stands proudly within a small town in Venezuela. It honors an unlikely moment of peace between two political adversaries. On November 27, 1820, Simón Bolívar, who was at the time president of Gran Colombia, and Spanish general Pablo Morillo met to sign a temporary armistice. Until then, Bolívar had been operating under his Decree of War to the Death, which was a policy of no mercy toward Spaniards and Spanish loyalists in America. Morillo, the head Spanish forces in Venezuela, came to the table because of the effectiveness of Bolívar’s ferocious independence movement and because of the recent mutiny of officers back in Spain. The mutiny is an important background because it was a decisive move by liberals in the royal military that restored the fledgling Cadiz Constitution, which protected the rights of Spanish people under the monarchy. The armistice recognized Bolívar’s presidency and intended to set the country on a peaceful path to independence. The armistice did not last, even though Morillo would forfeit his command as a result of it, returning to Spain and defend the Cadiz Constitution. What’s especially notable about the meeting is how much both generals and their senior staff liked each other. Morillo wrote fondly of the meeting, saying that they planned to erect a monument and Bolívar, whose many talents included making friends in unlikely places, made reference to the many toasts that the group drank together. The monument that the men agreed to that evening was indeed erected, and stands to this day in the small town of Santa Ana.",war politics monuments military
