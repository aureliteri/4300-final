0,Murchison Falls,Uganda,Where the White Nile River dramatically cascades between Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert in Uganda.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/murchison-falls-kabalega-falls,"Also known as Kabalega Falls, Murchison Falls is a spectacular waterfall where the White Nile bursts through a narrow rocky gap and tumultuously tumbles some 140 feet into a pool known as “The Devil’s Cauldron” before flowing into the tranquil Lake Albert. English explorers Samuel and Florence Baker named Murchison Falls named after the president of the Royal Geographical Society, Roderick Murchison. The local name, Kabalega Falls, is a remnant of Ugandan military officer and former president Idi Amin’s regime. In the 1970s, Amin unofficially renamed Murchison Falls to Kabalega Falls in reference to Kabalega of Bunyoro, the late-19th-century king of Bunyoro, Uganda. Murchison Falls crown the magnificent surrounding region, which is subsequently known as Murchison Falls National Park. The park is sited in the Albertine Rift Valley’s picturesque northern end. The park was established as a game reserve in 1926, and today, it serves as the oldest and largest reserve of its kind in the nation. Comprised of the National Park, Bugungu Wildlife Reserve, and the Karuma Falls Wildlife Reserve, the Murchison Falls Conservation Area is home to more than 70 mammal species and 450 species of birds. The riverbanks are dotted with buffalo, hippos, and crocodiles, while elephants, lions, leopards, chimpanzees, and giraffes roam the forests and savannas. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited what is now the National Park in 1907, and notably remarked that the landscape reminded him of a wild Kew Gardens. Other visitors of historical significance include Ernest Hemingway, who supposedly crashed a plane near the falls in 1954,  and former United States President Theodore Roosevelt. The area also makes an appearance in the 1951 film, The African Queen.  Murchison Falls National Park is accessible by car and by plane. The National Park is a popular site for wildlife viewing, hiking, and bird watching. Hot air balloon rides are also offered for an aerial view of the landscape. The park is open year-round, but visits are particularly recommended between January and March, June and late September. Several options for safari are available to prospective visitors.",waterfalls national parks natural wonders water nature
1,Equator Line Restaurant,"Kayabwe, Uganda","This small roadside eatery exists in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, as the equator runs right through it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/equator-line-restaurant-uganda,"Order a coffee from a barista standing in another hemisphere at this photogenic geographical oddity. A yellow line is painted across a busy village road chock full of motorcycle taxis, thundering buses, and trucks. The line passes through a pair of bright white circular structures, bearing the words “Uganda Equator.” This simple stripe marks the globally significant parallel at 0 degrees latitude. The equator passes through the center of these large, selfie-hotspot hoops on either side of the busy thoroughfare and goes straight through the main entrance of the Equator Line Restaurant. Inside the eatery, the line of the equator crosses the cool tiled floor, passes a bar area, and continues as a yellow painted strip up the wall. Here, in this popular restaurant 6,025 miles from the North and South Poles, the division of Earth’s hemispheres is clearly marked for all to see. The equatorial establishment offers visitors the chance to undertake a series of “water experiments,” one in each hemisphere, and a third directly on the equator itself, after which they are awarded an “equatorial certificate.” In addition to all the the geographical fun to be had, visitors shouldn’t forget that the Equator Line Restaurant is also a place to dine. The eatery serves wonderfully aromatic, freshly ground Ugandan-grown coffee, and the rolex, a favorite Ugandan snack that’s a kind of mixed vegetable omelette wrapped in chapati bread. This local dish is complemented on the menu by a range of food and drink from all over the globe, upon whose principal dividing line the small eatery proudly sits.  The restaurant is in the village of Kayabwe, a little over halfway between the Ugandan capital, Kampala, and the busy city of Masaka. Many tours operating from Kampala or the lakeside resort of Entebbe, bound for the national parks of Bwindi, Queen Elizabeth, and Lake Mburo pass through Kayabwe, and most will stop at the equator line for an unmissable photo opportunity. Public transport is also available from Kampala in the form of regular buses bound for the west of the country and Rwanda.",geographic oddities geographic markers restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars
2,Bwindi Impenetrable Forest,"Kisoro, Uganda",The home of half the world's population of critically endangered mountain gorillas.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bwindi-impenetrable-forest,"It’s tough to describe the feeling of disbelief as you watch a wild gorilla happily devour the plant that, only five minutes prior, burned your skin due to slight contact with its unforgiving leaf. The stinging nettle plant is just one of the reasons for the area’s intimidating name, the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Located in the mountains of Uganda, this dense tangle of trees is home to many species, including about half of the world’s population of endangered mountain gorillas. It’s estimated that fewer than 900 mountain gorillas exist in the world. Catching a glimpse of these rare, beasts in their natural habitat is an awe-inspiring experience. There are several gorilla families that roam freely and peacefully around Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. This is to the credit of organizations like the Mgahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest Conservation Trust (MBIFCT). These organizations hire trained gorilla trackers to spend their days finding and staying with the gorilla families. In this way, the trackers are able to study the gorillas’ behavior, condition them to see humans as a non-threat, and protect them from poachers. Visitors have the opportunity to hike and explore the forest to spend some quality time with these smelly but beautiful creatures. Although the battle with the thick brush can last for several grueling hours, there’s no experience quite like this one. Walking and grunting among the gorillas is well worth the exhausting trek. All the profits from a gorilla trek go into further research and conservation efforts. Not only will you find yourself standing a few feet away from a wild gorilla, but you will witness the beauty that lives within the Ugandan villages surrounding them. And don’t worry, although the stinging nettle will inevitably get you, the forest is also home to the plant that contains the remedy.  Bwindi is the most popular place to trek for gorillas in Uganda. The park is located in the Southwestern part of the country and is one of the most diverse national parks in East Africa. Bwindi is divided into four regions: Buhoma region, Ruhija region, Rushaga region, and Nkuringo region. Gorilla permits are issued within one of these four areas for tourists. Within each region is a family or several that have been habituated to humans. To avoid rain, the best time to visit the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest Reserve is during the ""cold"" season in June through July. It is highly recommended to book your visit with a licensed gorilla trekking tour to ensure safety. The forest reserve is accessible by either airplane or car. For drivers, Bwindi is a two to three-hour drive from Kampala or can be reached via a daily bus service from Kampala to Butogota by way of Rukungiri and Kihiihi. By air, Bwindi is served by three airfields. Travelers can fly in from Kampala or Entebbe.",endangered animals forests ecosystems nature animals
3,Source of the Nile at Jinja,"Jinja, Uganda","A strangely forgotten claimant to the much contested title of ""Source of the Nile.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/source-of-the-nile-at-jinja,"On August 3, 1858, John Hanning Speke discovered the source of the Nile—in a sense. What remains unquestionable is the fact that this spot became the source of a historic feud between Speke and his expedition-mate, Richard Francis Burton, who were once united in a hellbent quest to pinpoint the same headwaters David Livingstone infamously failed to locate. This small spot along the shoreline in Jinja, Uganda, marks the place where Speke “discovered” the Nile’s headwaters at Lake Victoria while his partner, Burton, convalesced separately at Lake Tanganyika. When the two camps reunited, Burton rejected Speke’s claim in favor of his own idea that Tanganyika was the source of the Nile River. Burton refused to consider the matter anything but “unsettled” until Speke leveraged the British media to lay claim to the validity of his discovery. A vicious public battle ensued between the two men, and continued to spread throughout the contemporary scientific community. It took the Royal Geographic Society stepping in to send Speke back to Lake Victoria to substantiate his theory, which he did in a manner some saw questionable, before the matter of the Nile’s source was declared settled (for a time) in 1863. The rift between the two men, however, would never heal. Speke, now a hero of the Age of Explorers, published two books that made him look a braggart. Burton, meanwhile, refused to accept defeat. A public debate between the two men was scheduled to take place at the British Association to settle matters once and for all, but on the day before the debate, Speke suffered an accidental, fatal rifle shot to the head while hunting. Popular assumption became that Speke’s death was a well-disguised suicide, motivated by a fear of facing Burton in public. The source of all this tumult is marked by a modest sign that reads “The Source of R. Nile - Jinja - World’s Longest River” at Ripon Falls, a series of cataracts that are partially submerged due to dams constructed downriver. A small cafe and shops, as well as boat dock with tours for hire, are located adjacent to this monument.  The site is best accessed via boat, and boat trips to the marker are available. Camping and nature walks are available nearby. It's also a great area for birdwatching.",exploration rivers
4,Lake Mburo National Park,"Nyabushozi, Uganda",Uganda's smallest savannah park is home to over 350 species of birds and mammals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-mburo-national-park,"At 260 sq. km, Lake Mburo National Park is the smallest savannah national park in Uganda. The park is nestled among local Banyankole Bahima tribal land. Lake Mburo National Park is teeming with wildlife, with over 350 bird species and large animals like zebra, warthog, giraffe, hippopotamus, impala, buffalo and the elusive eland. The park works closely with the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) on wildlife conservation. This collaboration has focused on the reintroduction of lions, baboons, eland and other wildlife that were destroyed during political unrest in the past decades. Multiple attempts to eliminate tsetse fly infestations as well as poaching activities also resulted in wildlife loss. By working closely with UWA and tribal locals, the park is an example of how wildlife and locals can successfully co-exist. The park offers ranger-guided tours to watering holes for wildlife spotting in the park and birding trips near the lake. Facilities include multiple restaurants close to the lake and tent/accommodation facilities to stay in the park. Expect to go on boat safaris, horseback rides, and guided ranger tours if you stay in the park. This park is a birding paradise so take your binoculars and camera for a unique Ugandan experience.  The park restaurant near the lake has simple Ugandan food next to spectacular lake views and is highly recommended for the price, quality of food, and view. An alternate hotel/resort to stay would be at the Igongo Cultural Centre, which is a 45-60 minute drive away. Be aware of vervet monkeys near the park ranger station who are wily enough to enter any open vehicle in search of a quick snack.",
5,Aero Beach,"Entebbe, Uganda",An aeronautical-themed resort forged around rusty relics from the golden age of air travel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aero-beach,"Leaning into the soft lakeside soil, or sandwiched between buildings like a disaster movie set, the corroded hulks of antiquated aircraft are conserved on this lively beach by Lake Victoria. The unlikely attraction is a mere stone’s throw from the abandoned control tower of Entebbe’s old airport, the scene of the Operation Entebbe hostage liberation in 1976. This Israeli Defence Force mission followed the hijacking of an Air France airliner en route from Tel Aviv to Paris. Though a persistent local legend claims that one of Aero Beach’s corroded exhibits is the original hijacked plane, none of the planes here were actually involved in the incident. The particular Air France aircraft that was hijacked was spared a rusty retirement as a giant lakeside climbing frame, having been salvaged by its owners following the hostage liberation. The airplane graveyard, which also boasts a bar and restaurant complex famed for its freshly caught tilapia dishes, is made more surreal by its series of selfie-magnet statues representing famous figures like Nelson Mandela, Queen Elizabeth II, Barack Obama, and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. In recognition of the historic rescue mission, a statue of Commander Yonatan Netanyahu of the Israeli Defence Force (the brother of Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu), who was killed during the operation, has been recently added to the collection.  Aero Beach is easy to find, on the left side of Airport Road before the security check point for Entebbe International Airport. It is passed by almost everyone arriving into Uganda by air.

As the burial ground for the previous four Kabakas, therefore, the Kasubi Tombs are a place where the Kabaka and others in Buganda’s complex cultural hierarchy frequently carry out important centuries-old Ganda rituals. In 2010, the complex was struck by a devastating disaster. The mausoleum and largest grass-thatched hut in the world was gutted by fire on March 16, 2010, at about 8.30 p.m. local time. The cause of the fire is as yet unknown. Fortunately, not all of the structures were completely destroyed. In 2014, restoration efforts backed by the Japanese government began. As such, this is still an active spiritual site and is still open to tourists.  The tombs have yet to recover from the 2010 fire, though what remains is open to visitors.

Painted in red and black pigment on six granite rock shelters, estimates put the rock art anywhere between 3,000 and 12,000 years old. Researchers believe they may have been created by the Karamojong tribe, semi-nomadic animal herders native to this region of Uganda. Visitors will have to hike to see most of the paintings, exploring some wonderful landscapes and weird rock formations along the way, as well as people living the local way of life.  There are no tour buses are going here; you will have to hire a car and drive up yourself. A guided tour is mandatory, which will cost 30,000 UGX ($1 USD is equal to about 3,800 Ugandan Shillings).

11,Jinja War Cemetery,"Jinja, Uganda",The final resting place of soldiers who fell during the First and Second World Wars.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jinja-war-cemetery,"Jinja War Cemetery is a peaceful and well-kept graveyard where rows of white headstones mark the final resting places of both European and African soldiers who died during World War I and World War II. Today, the city of Jinja on the banks of Lake Victoria is best known for two things: It’s the historic source of the Nile River, and is now one of the main hubs in East Africa for outdoor activities like kayaking, mountain biking, and quad biking. But before all this, Jinja was the center for the King’s African Rifles (KAR) in Uganda during the Second World War. Established in 1902, the KAR was a multi-battalion British colonial regiment that served in East Africa. Its rank and file was formed mainly from African soldiers known as askaris, while most of the officers were from the British Army. Starting in the 1960s, as former African colonies began achieving independence, the regiment began to break apart. The Jinja War Cemetery was created as the last resting place for fallen soldiers of the KAR, the vast majority of whom died during World War II. According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the cemetery contains only one First World War burial and 179 burials and commemorations from the Second World War. Most of the graves are those of Ugandans who fought and died with the KAR. There are only a handful of British graves, the most notable being that of Sergeant V.L. Holloway, who died in 1944 while serving in Great Britain’s Royal Army Service Corps. His headstone bears a famous line from the poem “The Soldier” by Rupert Brooke: “There’s some corner of a foreign field that is for ever England.” Also within the cemetery is the Jinja Memorial, a wall that commemorates more than 120 men of the East African Forces who died while serving in World War II. These men were buried in other parts of Uganda, but their graves were later deemed unmaintainable.  Jinja War Cemetery is located not far from the center of Jinja, along Kiira Road and Rotary Road. The cemetery is open Monday to Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.",wwi world war i war memorial graveyards burial places military history world war ii memorials cemeteries military
12,Kigungu Missionary Landing Site,"Entebbe, Uganda",A monument marks the spot where the first Catholic missionaries arrived in Uganda.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kigungu-missionary-landing-site,"In 1879, two French missionaries crossed Lake Victoria and landed on the Kigungu Peninsular. They were the first Catholic missionaries to arrive in Uganda, and an annual pilgrimage still convenes at the site of their landing. Today, Christianity is the dominant religion in Uganda. The majority of the population (around 80 percent) is Christian, with almost 40 percent identifying as Roman Catholic. And it all began when two French missionaries landed on the northern shores of Lake Victoria. On April 22, 1878, the First Caravan of a Roman Catholic society known as the White Fathers left Marseilles for Africa. The missionaries landed on Zanzibar on June 17, before heading on foot into the African interior. It was a challenging journey through unknown territory, and when the caravan reached Lake Victoria, only two of the group decided to push on across the lake. These two men, Father Simeon Lourdel and Brother Amans, crossed the lake and arrived near Entebbe on the Kigungu Peninsular on February 17, 1879—a day known recognized as the arrival of Catholicism in Uganda. The two missionaries continued north, passing through Kisubi and Rubaga, by which time their arrival had been brought to the attention of Muteesa I, the Kabaka (King) of the Kingdom of Buganda (a subnational kingdom which still exists in Uganda today). Muteesa I ordered that the two French missionaries be taken to Kitebi, where they spent 15 days, both suffering from fever. It was a crucial time for the missionaries. Food was scarce, and without approval from the king, their fates were very much in the balance. But on February 23, as the two men battled their fevers, Muteesa I sanctioned their arrival and sent canoes across the lake to bring the rest of the caravan to Uganda. Not long after, the missionaries visited Muteesa I at his capital of Banda-Kampala. He gave them Lubya Hill on which to build churches, schools, and hospitals. The king, meanwhile, continued to court other new arrivals, including Arab traders and Muslim missionaries, while at the same time fathering 98 children with his 87 wives. He was, if nothing else, a very busy man. Today, a brick monument marks the spot on which the two missionaries first landed in Uganda. At either side of the monument are statues of the two men, both kneeling, one in prayer and the other with hands raised towards the heavens. A plaque on the monument reads: “On this spot landed the first Catholic missionaries of Uganda on the 17th day of February in the year of our Lord 1879; Reverend Simeon Lourdel and Brother Amans of the society of the White Fathers.” Since the 1960s, the site has become an increasingly important pilgrimage destination among Uganda’s Catholic population. Each year on February 17, hundreds of pilgrims travel to Kigungu to commemorate the arrival of Christianity in Uganda, and to pay their respects to Father Simeon Lourdel and Brother Amans.  The monument is located near the Kigungu Catholic Church in Kigungu. The village is about three miles from Entebbe, and right next to Entebbe International Airport.",pilgrimages catholic christianity religion monuments sacred spaces history

The springs have been well-managed for some time, and the grounds surely are a testament to the work put in over these many years. When you’re done soaking in the hot springs, you can explore all the scenic landscape has to offer. The grounds themselves are home to expansive gardens, as well as an expanding coffee plantation. The many paths are coated with an array of natural and exotic flora species, with descriptive markers on most of them.

With options to camp along the mighty river bank or cozy up in one of the chalets, the lodge has an array of activities that you could get lost in, such as white water rafting, hiking, and playing with puppies. Less than a mile down the road is an incredible scenic hike, allowing you to view deeply into the Shiwa valley. From Lusaka, take one of the larger bus companies (Juldan, Power Tools, or Likili) headed toward Kasama.

The museum is divided into sections: history, ethnography, art, the usual fare—but the fourth section is devoted to witchcraft. The witchcraft exhibit is a fascinating window into the traditional beliefs of Zambia, a blend of Christianity, superstition, and magic. Among the items on display are a snakeskin belt that helped a sorcerer sleep with another man’s wife while the husband was in the same bed, a collection of dolls responsible for all sorts of curses and maledictions, and a potion that allowed the wearer to magically steal crops from a neighbor’s fields. While many of the exhibits are relics of the past, there was a new addition to the museum in 2013 that involved a more contemporary, and cruel, form of witchcraft.  In June 2013, three brothers (Mika, Fabian, and Stephano) were killed by a coalition of the Zambian police and army.  The shootout was the culmination of a seven year search for the brothers who were responsible for murdering 12 people in cold blood. The Mailoni Brothers are well known in Southern Africa, and they have left Zambia with some disturbing, unanswered questions.  How could 3 illiterate brothers have avoided capture for seven years?  What drove them to murder?  Why were they carrying Christian iconography?  The answer, for many Zambians, is witchcraft. In July of that same year, the museum acquired the Mailoni brothers’ possessions: crude knives, spears, and a bow and arrow and added them to the witchcraft exhibit. In reality, the brothers represent a fundamental question that witchcraft, as well as all religions, attempt to answer—how can one protect themselves from the evil in this world?

The high number of pans, papyrus swamps, dambos, and floodplains makes Kasanka an especially good haunt for birders, with more than 400 avian species recorded in the park. What the park is most notable for, however, is the enormous annual bat migration. Between November and December each year, some 5 million to 10 million straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) descend on the park to feast on the area’s musuku, mufinsa, and other fruit trees. Scientists are not sure exactly where the bats spend the rest of the year, though they are known to come from deep in the Congo rainforest. Visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of this thrilling sight are led on guided tours to various tree hides in the park during the dawn and dusk hours when the nocturnal creatures are especially active. There are so many bats that they darken the sky. The sheer number of bats makes this tradition one of the largest annual mammal migrations on the planet.  The park is managed by a unique private-public partnership known as the Kasanka Trust. The Trust is responsible for running all aspects of park operations. Reservations can be made by calling or emailing the park through their website. Although the park offers wildlife viewing throughout the year, the bat migration occurs in November and December.",migrations fauna bats national parks birds nature animals

At that time, large coniferous trees thrived, such as Dadyoxlon sp. and Rhexoxylon africanum. When these trees died, they were eventually buried and turned to stone. The site today contains a large number of extremely well-preserved ancient trees, with features such as tree rings and bark still visible on the fossils. Many of the trees are lying in what appears to be the same location and position as when they fell during the Jurassic Period. The fossils are in a large array of sizes, from small fragments to complete logs up to 30 feet long. Scientists posit that 150 million years ago, what is today a desert region enjoyed a more temperate and wet climate, favorable to growing tall coniferous trees, but also prone to storms and floods. A giant flood may have felled the large trees in this ancient forest, which were then preserved in a layer of soil and petrified as the organic materials were replaced by minerals. In modern times, the unique Chirundu Fossilized Forest is a National Monument of Zambia.  The Fossilized Forest is designated by a small marker on the right side of the road as you head towards Kariba on the Lusaka-Kariba Road. There is an example log near the marker and paths that lead around the area, but many of the most impressive logs are actually across the road. The local villagers will lead you to the best specimens if you ask nicely. It is illegal to remove any fossils from the site.",prehistoric fossils forests trees ecosystems plants geology
18,Chishimba Falls,"Kasama, Zambia",Arrogance and quarreling are forbidden near these three sacred waterfalls.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chishimba-falls,"The spellbinding beauty of these waterfalls isn’t the only thing keeping visitors on their best behavior. According to the tradition of the Bemba people, the watery wonder is home to the nature spirit Chishimba, who lives in a cave behind the falls. Because of the spirit’s presence, bad behavior, including fights, insults, and arrogance, is not allowed in the vicinity of the falls. Chishimba Falls is actually a series of three waterfalls along the Luombe River. The individual falls are named Mutumuna, Kaela, and Chishimba, and are separated by a distance of fewer than 1,000 feet. Though the Bemba people arrived in this area in the 17th century, they weren’t the first to call this spectacular sliver of nature home. The land surrounding the falls is dotted with evidence of Iron Age activities, including kilns, smelting pipes, and iron ore deposits. The falls are stunning in their natural beauty, with water cascading year-round over wide granite cliff faces. The falls are surrounded by thick mist forests, which provide a home to many birds and other wildlife. Trails throughout the park and several gazebos offer excellent views of each of the falls and access to the entire site.  The falls are located approximately 22 miles west of Kasama along the Kasama-Mporokoso Road. The road to the falls is marked by signs. At the, park an entry fee is collected and a visitor's center provides information about the falls. The falls also includes camping and picnic areas.",waterfalls rivers water

Along the river is Kalambo Falls, a 725 foot (221 meters) high single-drop waterfall, making it the second-highest in Africa. Besides the stunning views, Kalambo Falls is an important archaeological site, with the earliest evidence of human habitation dating approximately 250,000 years ago until the present day. This makes Kalambo Falls one of the longest continuously inhabited areas in the world. From 1953 to 1963, archaeologist J.D. Clark made extensive excavations of the Kalambo Falls site. He found evidence of continuous habitation at the site dating to the early Stone Age. These finds included stone tools, hearths, and well-preserved organic objects. Kalambo Falls represents one of the strongest sites for evidence of early fire use by humans, with artifacts including charred logs, charcoal, and fire-hardened wooden implements dating to 60,000 years ago. Additional artifacts, such as heavy woodworking tools and burial sites, provide evidence of habitation in the region through the middle and late Stone Ages to the Iron Age, which saw the introduction of the Bantu people.  Kalambo Falls is located approximately 24 miles (40 kilometers) north of Mbala over dirt roads generally only accessible by 4x4s or skilled drivers. Taxi drivers in Mbala are willing to take visitors to the falls for 250-300 Zambian Kwatcha ($25-30 USD). Lake Chila Lodge in Mbala also organizes trips to the falls on Fridays and Saturdays. Once at the falls, there is an entry fee of seven Kwatcha for Zambian residents or $15 for visitors.

Excavations into its floor have revealed a long and detailed history of human habitation, dating to as far back as 15,000 to 20,000 years ago. In the pre-colonial era, the cave was also used by the Bisa and Lala people to hide from the Bemba and Ngoni raids. Archaeological digs have discovered evidence of three distinct Stone Age industries, dubbed Nachikufan I, II, and III. It’s the best such stone age sequence in Zambia, and does more than just hint at the area’s human history. In addition to the archaeological evidence, the cave contains several rock paintings, though many are unfortunately quite faded and difficult to see. There are three different types of paintings, including the only black rock paintings in Zambia. The earliest paintings include red, geometric paintings, and naturalistic paintings of elephants, antelope, and other animals done in a black silhouette. The most recent paintings are done in greasy white paints and depict tools and unidentified animals. The cave contains several small displays depicting enhanced pictures of the drawings in the cave, along with artifacts excavated in the cave. The displays explain the history of the site’s human habitation and are useful for explaining its archaeological history. In addition, viewpoints outside the cave provide excellent vantage points of the beautiful surrounding landscape.  The caretaker for the site lives just along the road on the way to the site, and will come to the cave when he sees cars or visitors passing by. The caretaker has the key to open the gate to the cave. If he doesn't arrive shortly after you park at the cave, his phone number is posted on the nearby sign.

It’s one of the largest collections of such paintings in all of Southern Africa. The rock outcroppings, which dominate the local landscape, contain numerous caves and were a natural gathering point for both animals and ancient humans. The majority of the paintings there are attributed to the Batwa. The paintings at the site, which covers an area of about 40 square miles, fall into two distinct categories. Some have a geometric or schematic style, while others follow a more realistic animal tradition. The geometric paintings include dots and lines arranged in squares, grids, circles, and ladders. Animals depicted in the paintings include elephants, elands, lions, bush pigs, and praying mantis. The paintings are thought to have either been guides to the animals that people hunted or used for ceremonies such as weather divination. Nearby archaeological digs have discovered Stone Age tools. These artifacts include blades, bored stones, dimpled anvils, grindstones, axes, and microliths. These tools, along with the rock painting, show that the area around modern Kasama has been continuously inhabited for thousands of years.  The site is located along the tarmac of the Mungwi road, heading east out of Kasama. Signs will point the way to the entrance. The site is open during daylight hours throughout the year, and a caretaker is present to collect the entry fee and provide a guided tour of the area. Many of the paintings are hidden or faint, so the guide is invaluable is spotting the paintings and providing a history of the area.

Missionaries first came to the region in the 1880s. The expansion of European empires heightened interest in mission societies, who saw opportunity in newly colonized territories and their native peoples. Inspired by the travels and writings of missionary explorer David Livingstone, several different missionary societies moved to establish missions in the central African regions he explored. The London Missionary Society, with which Livingstone first began his travels, was the first of these organizations to establish a mission in what would become Zambia. The mission’s lakeside location positioned it to readily welcome travelers arriving by boat, causing it to flourish. It did so well that between 1895 and 1896, the mission upgraded to a large stone church overlooking the lake. The church served as a place of worship continuously until 1908, when the mission moved inland to avoid the sleeping sickness carried by tsetse flies near the lake. The original church has been declared a national monument in Zambia. It’s the oldest surviving stone church in the country. Though its walls still stand, the roof is no more.  The churchyard is accessible 24/7 without an entry fee, though visitors are asked not to enter the church itself and only view it from the outside.",africa christianity colonialism churches monuments abandoned sacred spaces ruins

The gorge walls are lined with a series of caves formed from when the silica in the rock dissolved away as groundwater penetrated from above. Archaeological excavations of the caves revealed artifacts such as buried pots and stone tools—including awls and scrapers—that date back to the Stone Age. The different caves in the valley show different levels of habitation, from occasional use by hunters to long and continuous use revealed by artifacts throughout the strata of the cave floors. Unfortunately, the most recent archaeological work on the site was in the 1950s. A lack of funds or interest has prevented further excavations of the caves since then. In modern times, the gorge is still inhabited by farmers, and an old homestead can be found at the bottom of the gorge. Although game is rare in the area, the hills are easily accessible and offer stunning views of the plains to the west of the escarpment.  Although a good dirt road leads to the valley, the gorge and the caves are unmarked and there are no signs to guide the way. The best option for adventurous travelers is to use a map program and GPS to ensure you are going the right away. The turnoff to the gorge is located approximately four miles down the Nakonde road as you are coming from the turnoff to Mbala.

It may seem humble, but it’s actually the origin of a mighty waterway. The Zambezi is Zambia’s most important river. It gives the country its name, and it most famously flows over Victoria Falls. Along the Barotse floodplain, it’s the location of Zambia’s most famous cultural ceremony, the Kuomboka of the Litunga. It’s the fourth longest river in Africa, and it gets its start along its 1,677-mile (2,700-kilometer) journey to the Indian Ocean from a small spring in the Northwestern corner of Zambia. The Source of the Zambezi is located in a small protected forest. It’s surrounded by a rich Miombo woodland and a strip of Mushitu forest. The area is rich in biodiversity, with nearly 200 bird species and mammals including the Tree Pangolin, Long Footed Rat, Red-Tailed Monkey, and African Palm Civet. Within the protected forest, elevated wooden walkways lead to the source and follow the path of the river down the valley for some distance. The source itself is a small spring that bubbles beneath the bottom of a fallen tree. A visitor’s center explains the importance of the Zambezi River, and provides information on the forest environment. The site also includes a monument to mark the Independence of Zambia, unveiled on 24th October 1964.  The site is located approximately 34 miles (54 kilometers) from Mwinilunga along a dirt road that is in the process of being improved. The best way to reach the source would be to take a taxi from Mwinilunga, or to drive a private vehicle with four-wheel drive.

It’s a remnant of Fort Zombe, one of the area’s most significant fortifications built during World War I. During World War I, British forces in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) had to defend their border with Tanzania (then German East Africa). The fort was constructed between 1917 and 1918, when the war in Africa was intensifying. It was built to give the British troops the ability to keep an eye out for any German advances. The site itself its surrounded by an outside enclosure measuring just over one mile (approximately two kilometers) all around. Today, this outer stone wall has collapsed, but it was reported to be about 13 feet (four meters) high and very thick. Along the outside enclosure are small structures that appear to have been sniper points. Inside the outer wall are other structures, including those believed to have been bunkers, sleeping quarters, and storage spaces for food and weapons. Also the top of the hill, approximately 330 feet (about 100 meters) from inside fortifications, are the remains of a gravesite reported by the local villagers to have held the remains of the last soldier killed in Zambia during the war. The grave was reportedly exhumed by “foreigners” in the 1980s, and the modern remains include a concrete slab reading “erected by E P Chesnaye, est dist comm., Abercorn” (Abercorn was the colonial-era name of Mbala). At the foot of the hill is a Y-shaped trench that protects the water source for the fort. Throughout the site, it’s still possible to find artifacts of the occupation, including food tins and bottles. Besides the history of the site, the location provides beautiful views of the surrounding valleys and mountains into Tanzania.  To visit the site, it is necessary to ask permission from Chief Zombe. The Chief's palace is located in Zombe village, approximately nine miles (15 kilometers) north of Mbala along the Mbala-Kasesha road. Any of the villagers will be able to direct you to the palace. Once at the palace (a regular-sized house), you must then greet the Chief and ask permission to visit the fort. A small gift (50-100 Zambian Kwatcha) is appropriate. He will either take you to the fort himself or have someone bring you there. For information regarding the fort, it is best to visit the Moto Moto Museum in Mbala and ask one of the staff there to explain about the fort.",wwi world war i borders walls forts graves gravestones burial places

Today, the numerous copper mines in the region provide the region’s wealth. But in the past, a darker industry spurred the settlement. Still standing near the center of town, the Slave Tree was the central location where Swahili slave traders met to discuss their gruesome transactions. Under its shade, Swahili traders such as Chipembere, Mwalabu, and Chiwala held councils of war and sold enslaved people to the Mambundu from Angola. Much of central and southern Africa, including modern-day Zambia, was crisscrossed by slave traders transporting human captives to the Swahili coast to be sold to Arab slave traders. These traders would enslave people themselves or buy people who had been captured by warring local tribes. Slavery was abolished in Zambia early in the 1900s, when the British Colonial Administration was established. The town of Ndola itself was founded in 1904 after the discovery of copper at the Bwana Mkubwa mine at the site of the slave trading post. The Slave Tree was left standing as a monument to the lives lost to the slave trade.  The Slave Tree is near the center of Ndola along Makoli Avenue.

Unfortunately, German forces in East Africa, led by General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, did not get the news until three days later. Thus, a monument in Zambia marks the spot where the hostilities of the First World War finally ended, on November 14th. The German general had led a largely successful campaign in East Africa, using guerrilla attacks and keep British forces occupied and away from the fronts in Europe. At the end of the war, he had entered northern Rhodesia (modern-day Zambia) and was marching near the city of Kasama to avoid British forces concentrated near Abercorn (modern-day Mbala). German forces captured the city on November 13, two days after the armistice that formally ended the war. A day later, on the 14th, General von Lettow-Vorbeckwas handed a telegram by a citizen of Kasama, Hector Croad, informing the general of the end of the war. The spot is marked by the Chambeshi Monument, located just north of the Chambeshi River in Kasama. The memorial consists of a large concrete platform, on top of which sit a German cannon and a stone pillar with two plaques: one in English commemorating the event, and one in Bemba honoring the soldiers that fought in the war. After being notified of the armistice, General von Lettow-Vorbeck was ordered by British forces to march north to Abercorn to surrender his forces. A pillar there marks the formal surrender.

In 1873, while attempting to map the rivers flowing into and out of the Bangweulu wetlands, he contracted dysentery and eventually died at age 60 in the village of Chief Chitambo in Zambia. Death was not to be the end of the journey for Dr. Livingstone, however. His attendants, Chuma and Susi, wanted to return his body to his homeland in the United Kingdom. They removed his heart and viscera, smeared his body with salt, and allowed it to dry for 14 days in the sun. They then carried his body 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) to the coast, from it was transported back to England and eventually buried with national honors at Westminster Abbey in London. The spot where Dr. Livingstone’s heart and viscera were buried was originally marked by an inscription carved into a mvula tree. In 1899, the tree was cut down and the carving transported to the Royal Geographical Society in London. In 1902, a memorial was constructed on the burial site in the form of a stone obelisk with two brass plaques. The monument has been maintained throughout the years and the plaques have been replaced. A third plaque was added in 1973 to mark the centennial of Dr. Livingstone’s death. Next to the memorial is a mvula tree descended from the original tree that marked the spot.

There, etched into a rock shelter, are the marks of the people who called this land home thousands of years ago. The Kifubwa Stream Rock Shelters are located along a picturesque valley on the Kifubwa Stream. The most stunning feature of the rock shelters is a series of engravings underneath a series of rock overhangs. These engravings consist almost entirely of geometric line markings and “U” motifs. They were made using the “incision technique,” where the stone of the rock shelter was repeatedly rubbed or chipped away using harder stones. Unusual for Zambia, these engravings were combined with painting, as red pigment was used to color in the engravings. The Kifubwa Stream Rock Shelters were first discovered by Western scholars in 1928. Excavations of the floor of the rock shelters revealed evidence of Late Stone Age hunter-gather occupation, carbon dated to between 6,000 and 6,500 years ago. A the time, it was the first site to show a clear connection between local rock engravings and Late Stone Age communities.

On November 14th, German General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck was delivered a telegraph informing him of the end of hostilities, and was ordered by British forces to march north to the town of Abercorn to formally surrender his forces. A memorial in Abercorn, modern-day Mbala, marks the rough location where the German forces laid down their arms. The small monument, situated on a small grassy circle in the middle of a roundabout in the center of town, features two plaques commemorating the historic event. During the war, General von Lettow-Vorbeck had led an effective guerrilla campaign to keep British forces occupied and away from the front lines in Europe. At the end of the war, his forces entered the British colony of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and captured the town of Kasama. There, the general finally learned of the armistice that had been signed in Europe three days prior. This event is marked by the Chambeshi Monument in Kasama. The British command then ordered General von Lettow-Vorbeck to march his forces to Abercorn, approximately 155 miles to the north, near the border of German East Africa (modern-day Tanzania). On November 25, 1918, a formal surrender was held in Abercorn, marking the final end of the Great War in Africa. Following the surrender, the German forces were directed to throw their weapons into the nearby Lake Chila, and then returned to German East Africa. German weapons remain to this day at the bottom of the lake. Examples of some of the weaponry recovered from the lake can be seen in the nearby Moto Moto Museum.

He was flying, along with 18 other members of the UN staff and other international officials, to Ndola to meet with the prime minister of Katanga Province. As the plane was preparing to land in Ndola, it crashed, skimming the tops of the trees and finally hitting down near an anthill. A fireball was seen from Ndola, but rescue personnel were unable to reach the site until daybreak. Dag Hammarskjöld’s body was found in a seated position at the foot of the anthill, and the other passengers were people found closer to the wreckage. In the years since, there have been several investigations into the crash trying to determine whether the plane was sabotaged or shot down, but no conclusive evidence has ever been found. Today, an expansive memorial stands at the crash site. A plaque marks the exact spot at the foot of the anthill where the Secretary-General’s body was found, and a monument surrounded by quotes from Dag Hammarskjöld commemorates the mission of the plane’s passengers.

The artwork depicts a man breaking free from chains, representing the struggles Zambians faced while overthrowing the chains of colonialism. It’s now such a potent symbol of Zambia that it’s depicted on all denominations of the country’s currency, the Kwatcha. The statue was erected in 1974 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Zambia’s independence. Although the country had a relatively peaceful transition, winning independence without a civil war or armed revolution, the struggle toward freedom was still long. It also, unfortunately, involved occasional violent suppression from the colonial government. This symbolic monument honoring the freedom fighters who died during the conflicts was inspired by a real event. The man immortalized in the artwork is Zanco Mpundu Mutembo, a native to the Zambian town of Mbala. After a trial following his arrest for protesting, Mutembo was sent to Livingstone Prison, where he was held in chains. With 18 armed soldiers facing him, he was ordered to break free from his constraints or be shot instantly. Summoning great strength, he managed to break the chains. Today, the Freedom Statue is a popular gathering place on Africa Day (May 25). On Zambian Independence Day (October 24), a wreath is laid to honor the freedom fighters that lost their lives.

33,Hulk of the SS Good News,"Mpulungu, Zambia",The forgotten remains of the first steamship that launched on Lake Tanganyika.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hulk-of-the-ss-good-news,"Forgotten and mostly buried in Kituta Bay on Lake Tanganyika lay the remains of the first steamship that launched on these waters, in 1885. After being shelled by a German warship at the outbreak of World War II, the ship was left grounded for decades and all but disappeared into the overgrowth. By the early 1880s, the London Missionary Society was established in the lands surrounding Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa, one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world. Preaching Christianity from their bases at Niamkolo and Ujiji, the lake offered a vital thoroughfare for the society to bring people and supplies to their missions. Although they already had a sailing vessel on the lake that they had shipped overland from Dar Es Salaam, a donation allowed the society to purchase and a steam vessel and transport it to the lake via the newly created Stevenson Road. It was dubbed the SS Good News. The Good News was a sturdy and high-quality ship, built of mild steel with a deck and woodwork of Indian teak. In addition to its steam engine, it had sails to aid in propulsion. It was 54 feet long with a beam of 12 feet. It had been specially designed to be broken apart into relatively small pieces suitable for overland transport and reassembly on the lake. Building the Good News became the responsibility of Edward C. Hore, a master mariner after whom Hore Bay on Lake Tanganyika is now named. When he arrived, he found much of the local population devastated by recent raids by slave traders from Zanzibar. He therefore chose a relatively remote location on the Lofubu River to construct the ship. With the first parts of the Good News arriving in 1883, it took Mr. Hore and his team two years to complete construction. The ship was launched and sailed its first miles under steam in 1885. The SS Good News lead a relatively successful career helping the London Missionary Society supply its stations and maintain contact with the communities around Lake Tanganyika. But by the outbreak of World War I, it had been permanently beached on the shores of Kituta Bay. Nonetheless, at the start of hostilities, the hull was shelled by a German warship to prevent the British from re-floating and arming the ship. It remained upright and above ground on Kituta Bay until at least the 1960s. At some point, due to neglect, the ship has fallen, and it is now largely buried, though some easily distinguishable hull plates and other components of the ship can still be seen peeking out from the overgrowth.  The remains of the SS Good News can be found in Kituta Bay on Lake Tanganyika. Kituta Bay is accessible via a walking trail from Mpulungu, or via 4x4 along a road that passes through Isoko. Once in the bay it will be necessary to ask around in the local village for the exact location of the ship. As a favor, the local villagers can lead you to the spot. The hulk is technically under the responsibility of the Moto Moto Museum, found in Mbala. The propeller of the Good News has been well preserved, however, and is on display at the Tanganyika Victoria Memorial Institute (TVMI) in Mbala.",shipwrecks ships christianity lakes world war ii water military history
34,Mbala Pioneer Cemetery,"Mbala, Zambia",A small cemetery on a hill overlooking Mbala contains the history of the town's colonial past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mbala-pioneer-cemetery,"Due to its strategic location, Mbala was one of the first places that the British colonial administration established an outpost in Africa’s Great Lakes region. The outpost was located on the site of Chief Zombe’s village in 1893 and was dubbed Abercorn. This long colonial history is reflected in the graves found today at the Pioneer Cemetery on Cemetery Hill, across the Lucheche river and overlooking the town of Mbala. The oldest graves at the cemetery are those of the early colonial administrators. The most famous of these is the grave of Hector Croad, the District Commissioner for Kasama, who was tireless in mapping and exploring the region. The maps he made would prove vital during World War I, as they were often the only maps available for the area. Croad was later chosen to deliver a telegraph to the commander of the German forces in the area, General Von Lettow-Vorbeck, informing him that the war was over. The general, unbelieving that this could be true, asked to send a telegram to the Kaiser, to which Croad replied: “There is no Kaiser.” The bodies of the military personnel that died fighting in the area were originally buried in the Pioneer Cemetery. After the war, these bodies were exhumed and re-buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Ndola, Zambia. A plaque outside the cemetery describes the military service of the 29 service members originally buried at the cemetery. A more surprising set of graves are those of a number of Polish refugees. During and after the Second World War, a number of Polish refugees fleeing the Soviet Union were settled in various parts of Southern Africa. The last of these camps was located in Mbala from 1943 until 1948. The site was dubbed “Little Poland,” and housed approximately 600 Polish refugees. The camp is remembered by Little Poland Street in Mbala, and by 18 graves of Polish refugees in the Pioneer Cemetery. These graves were restored by the Polish Embassy in South Africa in 2015, and are marked with white gravestones and steel crosses. The Pioneer Cemetery still sees the occasional burial, though most burials now take place at the nearby Mutambilike Cemetery. The grounds become very overgrown in the rainy season, although occasional maintenance takes place.  The Pioneer Cemetery is located just outside town, on Cemetery Hill along the Kasesha Road. There is a plaque located at the entrance to the cemetery describing some of the history.

35,Zwangendaba's Gravesite,"Nteko, Zambia","A Zulu warrior is buried far from home, near the very northern border of Zambia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zwangendabas-gravesite,"In 1816, King Chaka established the Zulu nation with such force and violence that it drove many Zulu tribes out of South Africa in an event known as the Mfecane. One of these groups was the Jere clan, who under the leadership of King Zwangendaba, would spend the next 20 years on a trek through southern Africa. Zwangendaba and his clan first fled to Mozambique under General Shoshangane, where Shoshangane established the Shangaan chiefdom. There, Zwangendaba parted ways with General Shoshangane and continued north into Zimbabwe, where he clashed with the Ndebele, another displaced Zulu tribe. Zwangendaba and his clan traveled farther north, eventually crossing the Zambezi river into modern-day Zambia on November 19, 1835, a day marked as auspicious by a total eclipse of the sun. In Zambia, Zwangendaba continued to move north, using his warriors to raid local tribes for cattle. By 1845, they had reached modern-day Tanzania, where they fought the Ufipa people to establish a territory for themselves. During one of these battles, Zwangendaba was injured by a poisoned arrow, causing his warriors to retreat back south. They camped near Tongola Hill and used herbs to try to cure their leader, but Zwangendaba died. His grave was marked by large stones and logs, and today it has been reduced to a circular pile of stones marked by a modern-day sign. Southern Africa continues to feel the effects of the march of Zwangendaba and other Zulu tribes out of South Africa. After Zwangendaba’s death, the tribe split up under the leadership of his sons, Mpezeni, Mperembe, and Mbelwa, and continued their journeys. Mpezeni’s people traveled south again, settling near modern-day Chipata (in Zambia’s Eastern Province) and intermarrying with the Nsenga people. Every year at the end of February, the Ncwala festival takes place which re-enacts Zulu traditions with thousands of people dressed as warriors. The first fruits of the season are tasted, the Chief drinks sacred blood from a speared black cow, and a singer recites praises in the Zulu language, preserved in a royal court far from the Zulu homeland.  Zwangendaba's grave is located approximately 18.6 miles from Nakonde along the Nakonde-Mbala Road. Traveling from Nakonde, the turnoff is to the left just after the marker denoting 159 kilometers to Mbala, and just before the railroad crossing. Turn left and travel about 0.8 miles down the dirt road. At forks, stay on the largest road.

36,Zesco Cooling Tower,"Lusaka, Zambia",The abandoned tower is the last remnant of Lusaka's first major power plant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zesco-cooling-tower,"At first glance, many people assume the large cooling tower on the western side of the city is for a nuclear power plant. Although no longer operational, the cooling tower actually served a coal-fired power plant, and was the first major source of electrical power for the then-budding city of Lusaka, soon to be designated Zambia’s (then Northern Rhodesia’s) capital. The city of Lusaka was established in 1905 and named after the headman of the village where it was founded. By the early 1930s, the British authorities were looking to move the capital of Northern Rhodesia away from Livingstone, and Lusaka was a natural choice due to its central location and proximity to the railroads. Moving the capital to Lusaka meant the area needed a power station. The location of the power station was chosen for its easy access to the railroads (and therefore coal supply), the burgeoning industrial area, and the prevailing winds, which carried smoke and soot away from the plant. The power plant began operating in 1934. It was the first major power plant in Lusaka and the second in Zambia, after the power plant constructed in Ndola to support the copper mines. Today, over 90 percent of Zambia’s electricity is from hydroelectric power. The cooling tower and power plant ceased operation in 1970 and has not been used for power generation since. The cooling tower remains a looming landmark over the skyline of Lusaka, and stands as a representative of the engineering heritage in Zambia.  The cooling tower is located on the grounds of ZESCO's headquarters and cannot be accessed by the public. However, it can be seen from afar from a variety of locations. It stands directly behind the Levy Junction Shopping Mall.",coal energy power stations colonialism industrial abandoned
37,Stevenson Road,"Mbala, Zambia",This little-known colonial road helped determine the Zambia-Tanzania border.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stevenson-road,"In the early days of European exploration and colonization in Africa, the only way to reach Lake Tanganyika, one of the African Great Lakes, was via an overland route from Dar Es Salaam to Ujiji. This was the route many explorers took to the lake, including David Livingstone and Henry Morgan Stanley. However, this route was controlled by the Muslim traders who dominated what would become the country of Tanzania. The control of the overland route by the Muslim traders had several impacts on the Europeans in the area. For the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, it meant they could easily be cut off from their missions on Lake Tanganyika, such as the Niamkolo mission on the southern end of the lake. For traders and others with commercial interests, it meant that the Muslim traders dominated the trade in the region, including the lucrative ivory trade and the trade of enslaved people. Creating an alternative route to the lake was, therefore, a viable option for both European traders and missionaries alike. James Stevenson, a Glasgow manufacturer and ardent supporter of African missions, hatched a plan to construct a road between the northern end of Lake Malawi (then Nyasa) and the southern end of Lake Tanganyika. This route was attractive for several options. People traveling via ship up the Shire River, along the length of Lake Nyasa, over the proposed Stevenson Road, and along the length of Lake Tanganyika could penetrate 1,400 miles into the continent’s interior with only 275 miles of overland travel. The relatively high plateau between the lakes was believed to be fairly free of the tsetse fly, making the use of draft animals possible, and the route would be over entirely British-claimed territory. Construction on the road eventually began in 1881 after a donation by Stevenson to the London Missionary Society, and the Society’s agreement to ship a small steamship (The SS Good News, the first steamship on Lake Tanganyika) via the Stevenson Road. Unfortunately, due to the difficulties of the terrain and the death of Stevenson in 1885, the Stevenson Road was in many parts more theoretical than an actual road. That did not, however, diminish its impact. Several missions and towns were eventually set up along the path of the road, such as Mambwe Mission, which helped to monitor and counter the slave trade in Africa. Other towns, such as Mbala and Fife, would be important during World War I. And when the German and British representatives at the “Scramble for Africa” were dividing the borders between themselves, the line between the eventual countries of Zambia and Tanzania was drawn parallel to, but just short of, the Stevenson Road.  The Stevenson Road today has largely been either replaced with modern tarmac road or bypassed. Some of the easiest portions of the intact road to see are near the Zambian town of Mbala. Approximately half a mile north of Mbala, there are well-preserved portions leading up to Cemetery Hill, and the along East-West road north of Lake Chila. A dirt road leading west out of Mbala to Isoko and then to the road's terminus in Kituta Bay on Lake Tanganyika is part of the original Stevenson Road. Further information about the road can be found at the Moto Moto Museum, about a mile outside Mbala.",slavery roads infrastructure history
38,Mbala Old Prison,"Mbala, Zambia",This old brick building has held everyone from prisoners of war to freedom fighters during its turbulent history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mbala-old-prison,"This abandoned red-brick building, known as the Mbala Old Prison, was built in 1912 by the British colonial administration back when Mbala (known then as Abercorn) was the seat of the colonial presence in Northern Rhodesia. It is now maintained as a historic building and a Zambian National Monument due to its long and poignant history. When World War I broke out in 1914, the Mbala prison was turned into a defense post for the Northern Rhodesia Police, which was the colonial military. The site was well-suited to repel German attacks over the nearby border from German East Africa (modern-day Tanzania). As the fighting progressed, the Old Prison was used to house German prisoners of war. When the war ended in 1918, the prison was then used to accommodate German Askaris—Africans drafted as soldiers to fight for the colonial powers—until they could be repatriated to their homelands. Later, prominent freedom fighters such as Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe, Zambia’s first vice president, were imprisoned here. Today the building stands empty and disused, preserved as a national monument and one of the oldest prisons in Zambia. Its duties as a prison have been taken over by the new Mbala Prison, located next door.  The prison can be viewed from the street at all times.

Tom Zwigelaar was working in the Broken Hill mine in the modern-day city of Kabwe, when the country Zambia was still Northern Rhodesia. An English paleontologist, Arthur Smith Woodward, later assigned the skull as the type specimen for a new species of hominid he dubbed Homo rhodesiensis. This discovery established Broken Hill as an important center for the study of early humankind. In modern times, the skull has been dated to between 300,000 and 125,000 years old. The classification of the skull as Homo rhodesiensis has also largely been discarded, with the “Broken Hill Man,” as the remains became known, generally classified as Homo heidelbergensis. The skull itself currently resides in the Natural History Museum in London. Zambia, however, has made efforts to repatriate the fossil. In the meantime, a monument to the discovery of the Broken Hill Man has been erected on the grounds of the Civic Center in Kabwe. The plaque on the monument is written in both English and Bemba.  The monument is located on grounds of the Civic Center in Kabwe, Zambia. The Civic Center is on Freedom Way, east from the Big Tree and next to Tusker's.

40,Chilubula Mission,"Mporokoso, Zambia",The first Catholic Mission to the Bemba people of Zambia still stands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chilubula-mission,"Chilubula Mission was founded in 1899 by Father Joseph Dupont of the White Fathers Missionary Society. Prior to the arrival of Father Dupont, Paramount Chief Chitimukulu of the Bemba people of Northern Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) was violently opposed to any missionaries operating in his territory. Father Dupont had first arrived at Mambwe Mission, to the north of Bemba territory, and worked to learn a great deal about Bemba culture and tradition. He was nicknamed “Moto Moto” (Fire Fire in Bemba), apparently due to his fondness for smoking a pipe. Eventually, some of the other Bemba chiefs allowed Father Dupont to start a mission at Chilubula, nearby modern-day Kasama. The mission itself includes a very large church, erected between 1899-1909, with huge Roman influence demonstrated by many Roman semicircular arches. It has been compared to a citadel because of its strength, and during the First World War served as a refuge to people fleeing the fighting between German and British forces. The site celebrates its founding by Father Dupont, with a marker identifying the location where he first pitched his tent at Chilubula under a Musashi tree, along with his dedication of the site. The Mission continues to serve the local people with a clinic on the site and St. Teresa Girl’s Secondary School. Father Dupont left Chilubula Mission in 1911 and eventually died in Tunisia in 1930. In 2000, his remains were moved and re-interred at Chilubula Mission. His grave is located inside the church to the left of the Sanctuary. Besides his legacy at Chilubula Mission, Father Dupont is also the namesake of the Moto Moto Museum located in Mbala, Zambia, which houses a very large ethnographic collection of Bemba artifacts.  To reach the Mission, head west from Kasama along the Kasama-Luwingu Road. After approximately 23km, turn right onto D20 (Mporokoso Road). Follow signs towards St. Theresa Girl's Secondary School and Chishimba Falls. After another 6km, turn left onto a dirt road that will lead you the directly to the Mission. The grounds of the Mission are accessible at all times, and the grave of Father Dupont is located inside the church. Besides services on Sunday, workers at the Mission should be able to let you inside to view the grave if you ask politely.",
41,Great Zimbabwe,"Masvingo, Zimbabwe","The largest prehistoric ruins south of the Sahara, once a powerful center of international trade.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-zimbabwe,"The ruins of this once-magnificent city are rich in historical significance, architectural wonders, and unsolved mysteries. Until fairly recently, the origin of Great Zimbabwe was a contentious issue among Western archeologists, most of whom initially refused to believe such an impressive and complex structure could be the work of native Africans. When Portuguese traders first described the massive city in the 16th century, the site was popularly believed to be one of the fabled cities built by the Queen of Sheba. Nineteenth-century archeologists posited that the city was of Egyptian or Phoenician origin. With reasoning characteristic of the racial attitudes that defined the era of Western colonization of Africa, the presence of indigenous artifacts in the city was regarded as evidence not of the original builders, but of the subsequent occupation. Attempts by Westerners to establish a non-African race as the city’s original designers resulted in the removal and destruction of numerous original artifacts and a devastating loss of archeological evidence. Despite this loss, objective findings by 20th-century archeologists eventually led to the conclusion that the city was indeed of African origin, though such findings were later repressed in attempts to undermine the African Nationalist movement. Today the builders are widely recognized to be ancestors of the Shona tribe, one of the region’s Bantu-speaking groups. The name “Zimbabwe” is said to have come from the phrase “dzimba dza mabwe” in the Karanga dialect, meaning roughly “houses of stone”. Great Zimbabwe is estimated to have been built between 1100 and 1450 AD, and its ruins span roughly 1,800 acres. The city, which may have housed anywhere from 12,000 to 18,000 residents in its prime, is divided into three distinct architectural groups known as the Hill Complex, the Valley Complex, and the Great Enclosure. The Great Enclosure bears the distinction of being the largest sub-Saharan prehistoric structure and boasts an 800-foot-long outer wall. These walls, which reach heights of 32 feet, were constructed entirely without the use of mortar; the granite used in the walls’ construction was split into blocks that fit together evenly and did not require the use of any kind of binding substance. Great Zimbabwe was once believed to be a hub of international trade, and artifacts recovered from the site were brought from as far away as China. Indigenous artifacts include eight large Zimbabwe birds carved from soapstone, which were believed to originally stand in the Eastern Enclosure of the Hill Complex. Though the identity of the city’s builders is no longer debated, many questions remain. The site, though well-positioned for trade, was not suited for the large-scale farming necessary to support the city’s population, and it is speculated that the depletion of natural resources played a role in its eventual abandonment. Despite researchers’ best guesses, however, the motivation behind the city’s initial construction and its later abandonment by the original inhabitants remains a mystery. The purpose of some of the city’s more prominent structures, such as the Conical Tower, also remains unknown.  The site is approximately half an hour from Masvingo by road. Access is possible via local minibus, as well as scheduled and chartered bus services. Masvingo is approximately five hours from Harare and three from Bulawayo.",racism cities indigenous archaeology ruins history & culture
42,Chinhoyi Caves,"Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe",The stunningly blue waters of these beautiful caves also have a violent past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chinhoyi-caves,"Chinhoyi Caves National Park is a hidden gem not far from Zimbabwe’s capital Harare. Visitors to the park will find stunningly blue pools inside preserved limestone and dolomite caves. Inside the caves, the air becomes cool and damp and silence descends as one walks down to the water. Holes in the roof of the cave usher in sunlight that illuminates its depths. One of the best parts of visiting the caves is that you’re likely to have them to yourself to enjoy in subterranean silence. What visitors can see is only the tip of the iceberg. The caves continue incredibly far underground in a complex limestone formation. The water is so clear and constant in temperature that scuba teams have descended to depths of more than 300 feet (100 meters). They have discovered subterranean passages linking the various pools. How deep these caves venture is still a mystery. Although serene, there is a bit of violent history surrounding the caves. In the early 1800s, as the story goes, an aggressive tribe swept into the region and murdered many local people. Their bodies were then tossed into the cave. The traditional name of the caves, Chirorodziva or “Pool of the Fallen” commemorates this event.  Camping is possible in the small national park, but if you are a day visitor, note that you will only be allowed in during daylight hours (about 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). The entrance fee was about 8 U.S. dollars in 2018.

43,Balancing Rocks of the Zimbabwe Dollar,"Harare, Zimbabwe","These naturally balancing rocks were pictured on every Zimbabwean banknote, up to the 100 trillion-dollar note.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balancing-rocks-of-the-zimbabwe-dollar,"These three balancing rocks were once the main design motif of one of the highest of the high denomination currencies in the world, the Zimbabwean dollar. Every note issued by Zimbabwe’s Central Bank—from the one-dollar note issued after independence in 1980 to the 100 trillion-dollar banknote (100,000,000,000,000) issued in the hyper-inflationary zenith of 2008, has pictured these three stones. The image of the stones was chosen as a conjoined metaphor for development and environmental protection following the country’s independence from white-ruled Rhodesia. The rocks themselves can be found in a national park with an abandoned feel in Epworth, a suburb in the thinly signposted outskirts of Harare. The stones pictured on the banknotes are the most iconic example of this peculiar geological feature found in many places throughout Zimbabwe: rocks formations naturally situated in perfect balance. Matopos itself is well worth seeking out. Once inside, visitors can either walk or drive around the Stone Age rock formations with evocative names like the “Giant’s Playground” and “Flying Boat.” Even rocks with no honorific convey a silent magnitude. Outside the park, some enterprising residents have built their homes among the giant boulders that pock all of Epworth. The Zimbabwean dollar, however, is no more. The government effectively abandoned its currency and was de-monetised entirely in 2015. Now, the notes can be found on eBay, on the back of playing cards, in the hands of hawkers trying to sell the dead currency to tourists visiting Zimbabwe, or as props for cautionary tales of the dangers of runaway inflation, devaluations, and mercurial government economic policy. Nowadays, Zimbabwe has a multi-currency system. Money from almost every continent in the world is legal tender: the Aussie dollar, the British pound, the Botswanan pula, the Chinese Yuan, the Euro, the Indian Rupee, the Japanese yen, the South African rand. However, the most predominant note in circulation is the U.S. dollar in which prices are quoted in shops, restaurants, and, yes, even parks housing the iconic balancing stones. “Bond coins” of 1,2,5,10, 25 and 50 cent dominations are given out as small change. But the stones are making a making a comeback in the newest type of money in Zimbabwe’s bountiful currency basket. Last year, the Zimbabwean government introduced a “bond note” that is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is illustrated with those same rocks from the old Zimbabwean dollar. Only a 2 dollar bond note is in circulation currently, but the government plans to incrementally introduce 5, 10, 20 and 50 dollar values over the next few months. Having a local currency bound to another is unusual, but by no means unique. Bosnia-Herzegovina has convertible mark tied originally to the German Deutschmark and now to the euro. For 50 or so years, there was de facto parity between the pounds of Ireland and the United Kingdom. But there remains apprehensiveness among many Zimbabweans who remember the old Zimbabwe dollar days. They live in hope that their new money will be as solid, stable, and unwavering as these three majestic rocks themselves.

45,Blood Falls,Antarctica,Natural time capsule containing an alien ecosystem.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blood-falls,"This five-story, blood-red waterfall pours very slowly out of the Taylor Glacier in Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys. When geologists first discovered the frozen waterfall in 1911, they thought the red color came from algae, but its true nature turned out to be much more spectacular. Roughly two million years ago, the Taylor Glacier sealed beneath it a small body of water which contained an ancient community of microbes. Trapped below a thick layer of ice, they have remained there ever since, isolated inside a natural time capsule. Evolving independently of the rest of the living world, these microbes exist in a place with no light or free oxygen and little heat, and are essentially the definition of “primordial ooze.” The trapped lake has very high salinity and is rich in iron, which gives the waterfall its red color. A fissure in the glacier allows the subglacial lake to flow out, forming the falls without contaminating the ecosystem within. The existence of the Blood Falls ecosystem shows that life can exist in the most extreme conditions on Earth. Though tempting to make the connection, it does not prove, however, that life could exist on other planets with similar environments and similar bodies of frozen water—notably Mars and Jupiter’s moon Europa—as such life would have to arise from a completely different chain of events. Even if it doesn’t confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life, Antarctica’s Blood Falls is a wonder to behold both visually and scientifically.

The thing is, building and operating expensive equipment on an active volcano is risky business, even if the area is considered one of the safest harbors on the continent due to its large caldera, a famous refuge from storms and icebergs. While several countries were bickering over sovereign flags and attempting to occupy the lusted-after real estate in the 1960s, the island had apparently had enough and kicked everyone off. Erupting twice in two years, it demolished research centers and buried everything left behind in ash, including a cemetery occupied by 45 deceased whalers and a long-deserted aircraft hangar. The island’s use is now administered under the Antarctic Treaty System, and it is now a popular tourist attraction as well as a scientific outpost. The giant iron boilers and tanks of the long-gone whalers still stand, large holes cut in their sides as a deterrent to the Nazis, who were feared to have been planning to use them to store fuel. Chinstrap penguins roam around everywhere, as the west side is home to one of the world’s largest chinstrap rookeries. One of the more unusual things to indulge in while visiting the island is to take advantage of the natural hot springs. Due to its geological temperament, Deception Island has a number of microclimates, which means if you can get past the biting, freezing Antarctic winds and into a volcanic bath, you can enjoy this snowy martian landscape in your swimsuit.

48,Mt. Erebus,Antarctica,Fire meets ice at the southernmost volcano on Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mt-erebus,"Erebus. It’s a good name for the volcano. In Greek myth, Erebus was the son of the god Chaos, and his mother was Gaia or Earth. Erebus was made of darkness and shadow, and he filled the corners of the world with his darkness. Currently, the most active volcano in Antarctica and the southernmost active volcano on Earth, the Mt. Erebus volcano features a 1,700-degree Fahrenheit lava lake, a swirling pool of magma that may be many miles deep: one of only five such lava lakes that exist in the world. While the inside of Mt. Erebus may be extremely hot, outside of it, one would quickly freeze to death in the Antarctic temperatures. Riddling the side of the snow-covered volcano are ice caves, carved out by the escaping volcanic gases. Because of the gas, the ice caves stay a consistent 32 degrees, making them a likely spot for undiscovered extremophiles. The volcanic gases heat their way through these ice caves and escape into the air to form enormous 60-foot chimneys of ice, or “fumaroles” with deadly volcanic gases pouring out from their tips. Discovered in 1841 by polar explorer Sir James Clark Ross, it was easy to identify Mt. Erebus as a volcano as it was erupting at the time. (Ross Island, which Mt. Erebus is on, is named after him as is the Ross Ice Shelf.) Later, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton would make the first ascent of Mt. Erebus between 1907-1909 on the Nimrod Expedition. One of the things that makes Erebus significant - and the reason it is the location of the Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory, or “MEVO” - is that Erebus is one of only a few consistently active volcanos in the world. Rather than lying dormant and then spectacularly erupting once every few hundred years, though it does that on occasion too, Mt. Erebus is always on, bubbling, releasing gas and flinging ten feet wide “volcanic bombs” - hunks of molten rock which sometimes explode on landing - through the air. For a vulcanologist, Mt. Erebus is a dangerous but dreamy research site. Mt. Erebus is also the site of a famous and tragic air disaster. An Air New Zealand DC-10 airliner on a sightseeing flight became lost in a whiteout and crashed into the side of the volcano on 28 November 1979, killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew. Famed explorer Sir Edmund Hillary was supposed to have been on board but canceled at the last moment. Debris from the crash is still visible on the volcano, despite an extensive recovery and clean up the mission. The unclaimed remains of the crash victims are entombed at a memorial at the Waikumete Cemetery in West Aukland, New Zealand where every year a wreath is laid in memory. The massive polygenetic stratovolcano spews out an average of 80 grams of gold a day, all of it dissolved in the volcanic gases.",edmund hillary polar week fiery wonders martian landscapes volcanoes geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems geology nature
49,Antarctic Exploration Museum & Post Office,Antarctica,The best place to send your postcards home from Antarctica.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antarctic-exploration-museum-post-office,"Located on remote Goudier Island on the Antarctic Peninsula, a former British research base now operates as a modest museum, gift shop, and post office. The buildings first served as the base for the WWII “Operation Tabarin” in 1944, a British military mission to monitor enemy activities in the extreme south following Germany’s airdrop of swastika-decorated leaflets across Queen Maud Land. Researchers worked out of the base until 1962. They then sat abandoned from that time until restorations in 1996 under terms of the Antarctic Treaty, which declared the buildings Historic Monuments and required that they be renovated. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) undertook the restoration and then opened the site up to visitors during the Antarctic summer. Port Lockroy was first discovered in 1903 by Jean-Baptiste Charcot’s French Antarctic Expedition and was named for one of the expedition’s backers. Of the six British Historic Monuments on the peninsula (Damoy, Detaille Island, Horseshoe Island, Port Lockroy, Stonington Island, and Wordie House), Port Lockroy is the only one fully restored.

50,The Ceremonial South Pole,Antarctica,Naked scientists race around the pole in the frigid cold to try to join Antarctica's exclusive 300 Club.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ceremonial-south-pole-antarctica,"Membership to one of the most exclusive clubs in the world takes place around a short red and white striped pole in Antarctica. Only those who endure an atmospheric difference of 300 degrees Fahrenheit are granted entry. To join the elite 300 Club, residents at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, where on winter days the outside temperature dips below -100 degrees, must bare it all. It’s an odd tradition, one that comes with a high risk of frostbite in rather sensitive, traditionally clothed areas. To join the exclusive group, the scientists must first spend time in the station’s 200-degree sauna. Once they’re fully cooked, they dash outside (at a brisk walk, because running is dangerous) wearing nothing but shoes and an optional neck gaiter to circle the ceremonial South Pole marker, which is hundreds of feet from the station. They then get back into the steamy sauna, which helps thaw their outsides while a bit of alcohol warms them up inside. Those who complete the challenge even earn a commemorative patch. Though the thought of a naked scientist racing across the ice in dangerously cold temperatures to circle a pole may seem simply absurd, it’s actually a beloved ritual. The temperature only gets low enough a handful of days each year, giving the wacky tradition an almost ceremonial feel. Participants are usually cheered on by bystanders who use flashlights to guide them to the pole during the perpetual winter blackness. The marker isn’t even the true location of the South Pole. Antarctica is blanketed by massive chunks of moving ice sheets that move about 30 feet each year. The ice’s inability to sit still makes pinpointing the world’s most southern spot with permanent precision impossible. Finding and marking the accurate geographic South Pole is an annual (fully clothed) New Year’s Day tradition for those staying at the station. Every year since 1959, South Pole residents erect a new temporary marker at the spot and retire the old one into a display case inside the station. The ceremonial South Pole remains where it is, flanked by the flags, awaiting the next group of winter scientists hoping to join one of the world’s weirdest clubs.",antarctic clubs geographic markers rites and rituals monuments
51,IceCube Research Station,Antarctica,The world's largest neutrino telescope searches for secrets of the universe at the South Pole.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/icecube-research-station,"When your grade-school science teacher described the various methods one can use to construct a telescope, drilling countless holes a mile and a half deep into Antarctic ice probably wasn’t one of them. But that’s exactly how the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory works. Call it a telescope, call it a detector, or call it an observatory—it’s all the same to the University of Wisconsin  scientists at the IceCube, which is now the world’s largest neutrino research array. Constructed between 2005 and 2010, the IceCube array consists of 86 identical holes, drilled 1.5 miles deep, scattered throughout the ice and filled with extremely sensitive particle physics monitoring equipment. The IceCube is a tangential facility of the much larger Amundson-Scott South Pole Station, both of which are literally located at the South Pole in Antarctica, where temperatures are normally a deadly -75 degrees Fahrenheit. The research being done at the IceCube is obscure and esoteric, as they essentially search for signs of tiny subatomic particles called neutrinos as they streak through the crystal clear ice thousands of feet below the surface, but its impact could be profound. Neutrinos are one of the most mysterious building blocks of the universe, and while studying them is notoriously difficult, the more scientists understand about their behavior, the more they will be able to explain how the universe works. More heralded and easily understood than the science of the lab is remarkable engineering it took to create it. Beyond the extreme difficulties of travel and habitation at the South Pole, the drilling of the all-important holes used for the array’s sensors is an engineering marvel. Using highly advanced equipment, scientists bored into the earth with an ultra-high-pressure hot water drill, not unlike a massive power washer. Each tube took approximately 40 hours to drill in total. Antarctica seems like a long way to go to measure one tiny particle, but the darkness and purity of the subsurface ice at the South Pole creates a naturally ideal environment for detecting neutrinos, which almost never actually interact with matter, making them very hard to measure. In fact, it is only when one accidentally collides with another particle and creates a reaction that its presence can be examined, and that is difficult to create in a lab environment – it’s more likely to be seen by happenstance over a large area, such as the gigantic IceCube array, which might be the most artful application of a using desolate location for the advancement of science to date.",neutrino detectors telescopes observatories instruments of science inventions architectural oddities architecture
52,Trinity Church on King George Island,Antarctica,Russian Orthodox church built on an Antarctic island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trinity-church-on-king-george-island,"From the scorching deserts of Sinai to the frozen tundras of Siberia, Orthodox Christianity has a history of building its churches and monasteries in inhospitable places. But only a few can rival Trinity Church on King George Island. The southernmost Orthodox church in the world, Trinity was built near Bellingshausen Station, Russia’s permanent outpost in Antarctica. In the mid-1990s, Patriarch Alexius II of Moscow gave his blessing for this audacious project. The church was constructed in Russia and transported by a supply ship to its present location. One or two monks from Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, considered the most important Russian monastery as it is the spiritual center of the Russian Orthodox Church, volunteer to man the church year-round. While most of the buildings on this continent are built to hug the ground in order to reduce their exposure to the polar wind, this church proudly stands 15 meters tall. It is a wooden structure constructed from Siberian pine and carved in the traditional Russian style by master carpenters of Altay. The priests manning the church take care of the spiritual needs of the staff of nearby Russian, Chilean, Polish, and Korean research stations. Their obligations include praying for the souls of 64 Russians who lost their lives in various expeditions, and the very occasional, very chilly, baptism. The church is large enough to accommodate 30 visitors, but it is rarely filled to capacity. Recently, however, the church performed its first wedding — the first wedding ever celebrated in a church in Antarctica — between Chilean and Russian researchers. Several tourist agencies organize charter flights from Punta Arenas, Chile, or Ushuaia, Argentina, to King George Island.",islands churches sacred spaces
53,Leningradskaya,Antarctica,This abandoned Antarctic research station is a Soviet ghost frozen in time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leningradskaya-2,"Perched on a rocky outcropping in the Victoria Land region of Antarctica is the abandoned Soviet research station Leningradskaya, and while it has not been in use for decades, it still sits there like a ghost from the USSR. Built in 1971, the Leningradskaya station was created by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition as a year-long research base that could facilitate their studies. The base stayed in operation for a full 20 years, allowing the Russian science teams to study everything from meteorology to magnetism to oceanology. During its tenure, the base, which sits atop a tall cliff, was assailed by extreme winds and storms that made base life a harrowing affair. Finally, in 1991, the station was evacuated after the Soviet Union fell and funding for the base was discontinued. In the time since the base was abandoned, the various huts have simply sat vacant, collecting ice. Most of the old huts were left just as they were with supplies and equipment intact, the idea being that one day, researchers might return and pick up where they left off. Most of the huts are squat square buildings that look a bit unremarkable and rusty, although one of the buildings does feature a minaret-like globe perched on the roof. Over the years, the newly christened Russian Antarctic Expedition has discussed intentions to reopen the base, but nothing has ever materialized. Russia has sent icebreakers to the site which may signal some renewed interest in reopening the base, but as of yet, nothing has happened.",abandoned research stations abandoned
54,Point Nemo,Antarctica,"At the point of oceanic inaccessibility, you can't get farther from dry land without leaving the planet.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/point-nemo,"Sometimes you just wish you could get the hell away from everyone and everything, and there may be no more effective spot to do so on the entire planet than Point Nemo, the spot that is farther from a landmass than any other spot in the seas. Technically, the spot, which is located far out into the Pacific Ocean, is known as the “Oceanic Point of Inaccessibility.” Its nickname is taken from the Jules Verne character Captain Nemo, a Latin name which itself translates to “no one.” The far-flung oceanic spot can be found over 1,450 nautical miles from the nearest landfall, which is one of three spots. Since the Earth is spherical, deciding on the most remote oceanic location required three equidistant points of measurement. They are Ducie Island, which is itself a barren and incredibly remote atoll belonging to the Pitcairn Island chain; the rocky Motu Nui of Chile; and Antarctica’s Maher Island, which is so small and remote it wasn’t even discovered until the 1940s. Point Nemo was first discovered in 1992 thanks to the use of geotargeting software. There are no commercial ways to access the most remote point in the ocean, and with good reason. There is nothing there. No beacon or anchored marker. Just vast expanses of open ocean. The only thing a visitor will find at Point Nemo is the honor of being harder to reach than just about anyone else on the planet.",cartography geographic oddities geographic markers maps water
55,Pegasus Wreck,Antarctica,"The remains of a doomed Antarctic plane, buried beneath layers of ice and snow, await those willing to do a bit of digging.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pegasus-wreck,"On October 8, 1970, the pilots of the Pegasus, a C-121 Lockheed Constellation plane, knew they had a problem. A fierce storm was ravaging the air above Antarctica. But they were forced to fly onward, a lack of fuel making it impossible for them to boomerang back to New Zealand. A slurry of snow and ice whipped through the air, erasing any and all visibility. The wind caused the aircraft to thrash around and beat the plane so hard it ripped off pieces of its exterior. Soon, the Pegasus was dropping toward the frozen desert below. It crashed atop the ground and skid along the ice before finally drawing to a halt. Miraculously, the 80 people aboard the plane survived the crash with no major injuries. They were all rescued and able to carry on with their Antarctic research largely unharmed, though likely a bit rattled. Now, anyone who happens to find themselves near the McMurdo Station can try to take a trip to the crash site. The Pegasus is still there, resting beneath a blanket of snow. Most of the plane is usually covered by layers of ice and snow, though people do like to unbury it to take photographs or carve their names onto its exterior. The crash even inspired researchers to rename the ice runway and airfield after the wrecked aircraft. However, Pegasus Field closed in December of 2014 because of excess summer melt.",wreck crash site snow aircraft airplanes
56,McMurdo Station,"McMurdo Station, Antarctica","Antarctica's bustling metropolis, originally established by Richard E. Byrd.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mcmurdo-station,"Located on volcanic rock marking the southernmost solid ground accessible by ship, McMurdo Station is the gateway of most all scientific, private, and touristic jaunts into the Antarctic. During the interminably sunny summer months, McMurdo’s population booms to over a thousand, comprised of scientists from both private and public spheres, supported by a whole cadre of seemingly-average Joes who keep the mini-city bustling. Grocers procure international comfort food, carpenters, and construction workers maintain the place, bus drivers transport passengers and goods via the infamous “Ivan the Terra Bus,” gardeners tend greenhouses - and everyone eats soft-serve ice cream from McMurdo’s cafeteria. One thing is for certain, individuals who choose to call McMurdo home, even for part of the year, can be as unusual as the climate at their doorsteps. Werner Herzog’s 2007 documentary “Encounters at the End of the World” admirably and lovingly demonstrated this point. And of course, when secluded in such extreme conditions, outlets for personal entertainment are of utmost import: a curling rink recently replaced the station’s bowling alley, there’s a weekly news publication, cable television, and personal Internet access to keep everyone sane. Though officially “founded” in 1956 as a base for scientists venturing to the south pole and other remote research facilities scattered about the continent, just a stone’s throw from modern-day McMurdo lies the spot on Hut Point marked by said-hut which was left stocked with provisions in 1904 by Robert F. Scott on his polar expedition. Thanks to the hut’s frigid (but dry!) climate and generally low-traffic location, the original pantry, laboratory and sleeping quarters of the men remain pristine and virtually untouched from their original condition. There are even the remains of seal butchered by the expedition for food. The hut is basically a time capsule of early Antarctic exploration. Obscura Day location: April 9, 2011. Access to McMurdo station is extremely limited outside of approved scientific purposes, your best bet is to volunteer for an internship or apply for a position in the base support staff (fire department, galley staff, etc).

57,Shackleton's Antarctic Hut,Antarctica,"Nimrod Polar Expedition base, and home to hundred-year-old frozen whisky.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shackleton-s-antarctic-hut,"Ernest Shackleton’s stash of hundred-year-old booze was discovered buried in the ice under the explorer’s Antarctic base camp. In January 2010 workers from the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust successfully extracted the cases from the ice and now one of them is being slowly thawed to see if the whisky can be saved. The hut served as the base of operations for the British 1907-1909 Nimrod Expedition, an early attempt in the race to the geographic South Pole led by a young Ernest Shackleton. The expedition set out from McMurdo Sound. Shackleton had taken part in Robert Scott’s earlier Discovery Expedition, from which he was sent home, most likely suffering from scurvy. It had originally been his plan to launch his expedition from Scott’s Discovery Hut on Hut Point, but after being specifically asked not to do so, Shackleton’s crew erected their own pre-fabricated hut at Cape Royds, just 23 miles from the original structure. The simple structure is 33 feet long by 19 feet wide, with separate lodging for the expedition’s ponies, dogs, and the first motorcar on the continent, a 12-15 horsepower Arrol Johnston specially retrofitted for the expedition. The expedition was plagued by the types of problems that would become the familiar hallmarks of polar exploration. An early sidetrip nearly killed six members of the expedition on the first ascent of Mt. Erebus which left them trapped on the side of the volcano in blizzard conditions. Later, the first attempt on the pole broke down in personality conflicts and equipment failures and was forced to turn back within 100 miles of the goal. Inadequate food supplies and the death of the expedition’s ponies on the return trip led Shackleton to complain, “We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow.” Some success was achieved by the separate northern expedition party who made it to the magnetic South Pole (a moving target, several miles from the geographic South Pole), which was enough to consider the overall effort a success. Upon leaving Antarctica to go back home, Shackleton wrote: “We all turned out to give three cheers and to take a last look at the place where we had spent so many happy days. The hut was not exactly a palatial residence … but, on the other hand, it had been our home for a year that would always live in our memories…. We watched the little hut fade away in the distance with feelings almost of sadness, and there were few men aboard who did not cherish a hope that some day they would once more live strenuous days under the shadow of mighty Erebus.” Shackleton was knighted upon his return to England. Five years later he made his most famous attempt at the pole. The Endurance Expedition, in which his ship became trapped and sunk in ice, was another technical failure, but an epic success story of survival against all odds. The Cape Royds Hut was restored between 2004 and 2008 as part of the Ross Sea Heritage Restoration Project, which is looking after the four Antarctic expedition huts. The building has been left almost exactly as it was at the turn of the last century. Workers hoped to uncover two crates of whisky rumored to be located at the hut, but were surprised to find five crates of whisky and brandy, intact and full, in 2006. They were carefully removed from the ice four years later. One crate of the whiskey has been carefully exported to New Zealand, where conservators are attempting to slowly thaw the bottles. The company Whyte and Mackay, the original supplier of the whisky is still in business, and now involved with the Canterbury Museum in New Zealand, where they are attempting to safely thaw some of the whisky so that a sample can be taken, and, hopefully, a recipe re-created. Once the experiment is completed, the crate will be returned to its home at the hut.

Spanish for “Stars Town”, Villa Las Estrellas is a civilian settlement located in the unforgiving terrain of Antarctica, only one of two on the entire continent.

Nearby Bellingshausen offers opportunities to learn about polar auroras and glaciology. The town has a radio station, TV reception, and yes, even internet access, although it’s reserved for the school’s three computers.

59,Erebus Ice Tongue Caves,"McMurdo Station, Antarctica",Southern Ocean waters and glacial forces transform the Antarctic ice into these stunning bridges and caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erebus-ice-tongue-caves,"Living in Antarctica? Tired of the ice-core-collecting grind? Then head on over to the Erebus Ice Tongue, where you can see some of the most spectacular ice formations on Earth. An ice tongue is a unique glacial formation created by an ice stream that flows faster than the surrounding ice and thus pushes out to sea ahead of the glacier’s edge. Moreover, this activity needs to take place in a protected harbor so that the ice tongue remains intact, rather than being broken up by strong currents or collisions with icebergs. It’s a fairly specific formula, and it can be found on the west coast of Ross Island, where Mt. Erebus — the world’s southernmost active volcano — feeds a valley glacier that flows ahead of the surrounding ice into a protected portion of McMurdo Sound. The resulting Erebus Ice Tongue is a slender peninsula protruding 11 kilometers from the coastline, where waves, tidal activity and internal stresses carve the glacier into these stunning ice caves. The strange serrated bird’s-eye appearance of the ice tongue gives some hint about the intricacy of the forces at work. Small holes on the surface of the ice open up into soaring, majestic spaces within the glacier’s interior. The flowing shapes and elaborate features — including “ice stalactites”, hanging ice bridges, and intricate, unusually large crystalline structures — are illuminated by a diffuse blue light filtering in from the cold Antarctic sun. The caves are a popular attraction for the residents of nearby research bases McMurdo Station and Scott Base, who come to marvel at the cold, quiet beauty of the place. Additionally, Weddell seals have been observed visiting the underwater caves of Erebus Ice Tongue — less to take pictures, more to avoid getting devoured by orcas and leopard seals. When visiting, humans are asked to please not pee in the ice caves; seals, being beyond the reach of human rules, can do whatever they like. Located inside the Erebus Ice Tongue, the ice caves are a protected place and can only be visited from McMurdo Station when accompanied by US Antarctic Program mountaineers. Getting there requires travel across the sea ice from McMurdo, so the site is only accessible for brief periods each year.",ice caves glaciers

Located at the furthest point from the Southern Ocean, the Pole has a year round average temperature of -58.2°C (-72°F). Due to its remoteness - the South Pole is 878 km away and the nearest city, Cape Town in South Africa, is 5631 km distant - the Pole doesn’t see visitors very often. A Soviet expedition led by Yevgeny Tolstikov reached the Pole of Inaccessibility for the first time in 1958. The group left a small research base, also called Pole of Inaccessibility, topped off with a bust of Vladimir Lenin that faces Moscow. The station was in operation from December 14th to 26th, 1958. Since then, at least two more expeditions have reached the Pole. An American expedition arrived in 1965 and in 2007 a British/Canadian expedition became the first to arrive on foot, where they discovered the research station completely covered in snow. Therefore, they were unable to get inside the building to sign the golden visitors’ book that the Soviets had left nearly fifty years before.

Ice and snow-free due to unique conditions, these valleys have intrigued researchers as the landscape on Earth that’s as close to Mars as we can currently get. With 98% of its surface being covered in a mile-deep sheet of ice, Antarctica is the epitome of an unforgiving environment. Life is a rare occurrence in this severe climate, which is considered the driest, coldest, and windiest desert on planet Earth - but life has been found, in the most unlikely of places, and that unlikely place is the alien terrain of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Despite having no actual human population to speak of and only a smattering of wildlife, Antarctica is not a hopelessly barren wasteland. Between 1,000 to 5,000 people, mostly researchers and scientists, brave the hostile continent every year, inhabiting the unique “town” of McMurdo Station. From this central hub, researchers have made groundbreaking discoveries in and around the valleys. From water samples of Blood Falls revealing microbes with metabolic processes never before witnessed to bacteria hiding from the dry winds in the interior of rocks, the valleys have changed our notion of what it takes to sustain life. While life does indeed thrive in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, don’t mistake them for a gentle oasis on the tundra. The lack of snow is not a sign of softness, but the result of 200 mph katabatic winds sucked down into the valleys by gravity and heating up as they pound toward the ground, evaporating any moisture in their wake. The mountains surrounding are high enough to prevent the ice sheet from covering the area, leaving naked, unyielding bedrock, scattered with loose gravel and the occasional ice wedge. This terrain full of mystery and surprises truly represents the tenacity of life and the possibility that it extends beyond the barriers we’ve assigned it.

62,South Pole Ice Tunnels,Antarctica,These passages carved from the Antarctic ice hold strange shrines to the harsh southernmost climes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/south-pole-ice-tunnels,"Deep below one of the world’s most remote outposts, a network of tunnels cut into the ice has come to house “shrines” dedicated to both the odd and the profound. Founded as a small research base at the South Pole in 1956, Amundsen-Scott Station has developed into a thriving research hub sometimes housing hundreds of science and support personnel at a time. What originally began as a cluster of wooden buildings has progressed into a state-of-the-art network of facilities designed to support scientific operations while mitigating the effects of the harsh Antarctic environment on its inhabitants. What many do not know, however, is that beneath the expanse of high-tech buildings, communications facilities, and even an airport complete with an ice runway, there lies a complex web of tunnels carved out of the ice itself. Completed in 2002, these tunnels were created to convey fresh water and effluent to and from the new “elevated station” buildings. Since that time, adventurous station personnel have descended into the tunnels (the temperature of which hovers just below -60°F/-51°C) to create personal memorials to a wide array of Antarctic experiences. Some of these shrines commemorate specific Antarctic seasons or completed work projects, and some are just silly. One of the strangest of these monuments consists of the body of an atrophied White Sturgeon and a handwritten account of its journey. The fish had arrived in 1992 at McMurdo Station (a US base located at the edge of Antarctica and the Ross Sea) and had been destined for a remote Russian station called Vostok. However, the Russians gifted the sturgeon to American scientists who later discarded it after it had languished uneaten in a freezer for several months. It was from the trash dump that a garbage processing crew reclaimed the sturgeon, and it then made its way from location to location across Antarctica. It finally became enshrined in the tunnels beneath the South Pole where it greets visitors from a ledge chiseled in the ice. With permission from COMMS, go to the bottom of the ""beer can"" that is attached to the elevated station and head down the tunnel towards the fuel arch.

Since then it has sat abandoned, but not neglected. The small base was first established by the BAS in 1956. Consisting of one long building and a pair of smaller outer structures, like a dog pen, the outpost was small, but the interests of its researchers were varied, ranging from conducting meteorological studies to gathering geological data to simply mapping the area. In theory, the team would travel by dogsled across the frozen sea ice between the island and the Antarctic mainland where they would conduct their tests, but it was not long before this proved to be an issue as the ice around the island was unstable and dangerous to traverse. In fact, Base W was only in use for two short years before it had to be abandoned. In the winter of 1958, the yearly freeze blocked the team’s supply vessel from reaching them. A pair of American icebreakers even came to help, but it was no use. Thus the decision was made to cut their losses and vacate the base before things got any worse. The entire team packed up their essential gear, locked down the huts, and trekked across 25 miles of treacherous sea ice to reach the waiting ship. The base was officially abandoned in 1959, but its story was not yet over. Members of the BAS returned to Base W in the 1996/97 season to find that the site had become a perfectly preserved snapshot of 1950s Antarctic life. The old Hoover washer was still there along with all the old log books, leftover supplies, and other everyday items that had to be left behind in the scramble to the boat. Leaving everything in place, they cleaned and winterized the site before returning home. In 2009 the base was officially named a historic landmark that is now kept up by the BAS, and while there is no one in permanent residence, anyone who manages to make the trip is free to explore the old base so long as they don’t disturb the historic site. The doors are left unlocked and there is even a guest book and a little cleaning kit, to both make your mark on the site and erase it.

64,Discovery Hut,"McMurdo Station, Antarctica",Wooden hut from the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/discovery-hut,"The time between 1897 and 1922 is known as the Heroic Age of Polar Exploration, a time when both northern and southern polar regions of the globe were visited by humans for the first time. The United Kingdom, the superpower of the age, envisioned itself as the natural leader in this endeavor. The Discovery Hut stands as a monument to one of their less successful endeavors. This humble wooden building was erected in 1902 at Hut Point on Ross Island near McMurdo Sound in Antarctica. The British, who had charged its best scientific minds with the task of designing a habitat and storage facility suitable for Antarctic climatic conditions, intended to use the base for the Discovery Expedition lead by Sir Robert Falcon Scott. Unfortunately, the best minds of Britain had never set foot in Canada or Scandinavia, much less the Antarctic. As an Antarctic habitat, the Discovery Hut proved to be an utter failure. The hut was prefabricated in Australia at a cost of £360 and transported in pieces by ship to be assembled on the spot. A square structure, it had useless verandas on the three sides, which served only as snow traps. The insulation provided by a relatively thin layer of felt stuck between two layers of wooden planks turned out to be extremely insufficient. The hut was unbearably cold and windy, so much so that the crew refused to use it and continued sleeping on the ship. The pyramidal roof was not slanted enough to permit the sliding off of snow, but at least it made the profile of the building low enough to avoid the most brutal whips of wind. However, this too proved useless as the hut was oriented with the entrance on the windward southern side. The hut was visited again by Ernest Shackleton’s expedition in February 1908. Shackleton found the main door ripped off the hinges by a gust of wind and the entrance blocked completely by accumulated snow. Shackleton’s men had to enter the building via the window on the leeward side. The lessons learned from Discovery Hut’s inadequacies were used in the design of the base for Terra Nova expedition, Scott’s next attempt to reach the South Pole. However, this was not enough to save the lives of Scott and his crew in this ill-fated effort. Some of the provisions left by expeditions of the early 1900s are still present in the hut. A few of the items are in relatively good condition thanks to constant subzero temperatures.

Antarctic scientists have proposed the dark stripes that streak the nearby cliffs came from some sort of downward flowing brine. As Mars boasts similar sets of recurring slope lineage, scientists use Don Juan Pond as a terrestrial base for studying water on the Red Planet.",mars antarctic salt martian landscapes deserts lakes geological oddities ecosystems water geology
66,Volcano Sponge of McMurdo Sound,Antarctica,"These giant volcano sponges in Antarctica are thought to be the world's oldest living animal, at 15,000 years old.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/volcano-sponge-mcmurdo-sound,"The quest to delay aging and look younger is as old as civilization itself. Who better to get some tips from than the oldest living animal: the volcano sponge Anoxycalyx joubini, found off the McMurdo shelf in Antarctica, thought to be nearly 15,000 years old. The sponge’s secret? Living in extremely cold conditions deep under the ocean. This type of volcano sponge is one of the largest and can be up to 6.5 feet in height and 4.5 feet in diameter. It is also one of the most difficult to study and understand, given that it can be found at a depth of anywhere between 49 and 472 feet. A lot of what is known about this organism is based on early studies conducted in the McMurdo Sound region. It was named after  Louis Joubin, a professor at France’s National Museum of Natural History in Paris. The pear-shaped sponge is usually white or pale-yellow and its interiors are often home to a number of smaller creatures like amphipods, isopods, and polychaete worms. Research has found that the sponges grow at a minuscule rate, which is nearly unobservable. The extremity of the cold habitat slows down all biological processes, leading to increased longevity. Anoxycalyx Joubini didn’t survive nearly 15000 years without some attacks from predators, the most of common of which is the seastar Acodontaster conspicuus, which accumulate in bunches on the sponge and slowly kill it. The sponge and its characteristics are studied with the help of a SCINI ROV—a Submersible Capable of under Ice Navigation and Imaging Remotely Operated Vehicle. The coordinates listed lead to the McMurdo research station, where studies of the sponge and other underwater fauna are carried out. The sponges themselves are located all across McMurdo Sound.",world's oldest natural history oceans animals
67,Lake Vostok,Antarctica,Largest sub-glacial lake ever discovered.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-vostok,"In 1996, Russian scientists were drilling ice core samples at Vostok Station in Antarctica. When they reached 3,623 meters (11,886 feet), they stopped because they couldn’t figure out why the ice at such an extreme depth was so clean. After a series of tests using radar and seismic waves, it turned out that this ice was actually the uppermost region of the world’s largest warm-water sub-glacial lake - a lake roughly the size of Lake Ontario. The lake is composed of fresh water and has been isolated beneath the glacier for somewhere between half a million and one million years. Naturally, the first thing that came to the scientists’ minds was that this lake could possibly be the most pristine liquid environment on Earth and could be full of living creatures and organisms that, due to isolation and adaptation, live nowhere else. Researchers tested the core samples taken close to the water and indeed found microbes that have never been found elsewhere. But when the question of how to explore the lake came up, not long after its discovery, the Vostok scientists faced a serious dilemma. The lake is under immense pressure, and to breach the ice would have devastating consequences. Secondly, anything sent into this pristine environment would have to be as sterile as possible to avoid contamination. In 1999, NASA approved funding for the development of a torpedo-like probe dubbed “Cryobot.” Equipped with a heated tip, the probe was designed to slowly melt its way down through the glacier, unwinding communication cables as it went. As Cryobot ventured down, the water would refreeze behind and above it. Then, before it breached the ceiling of the lake, the probe was to decontaminate itself with a hydrogen peroxide bath. Once inside, Cryobot would release the remote-controlled “Hydro boat,” a specially designed submersible vehicle equipped with a camera and other instruments, to explore the interior of the lake. Despite promising tests, funding for the project was cut in 2003. One hope, however, is that due to the discovery that Mars also has sub-glacial lakes and that Jupiter’s moon Europa may have them as well, the Cryobot project will be re-opened soon in order to test technology for future space missions. UPDATE: As of February 2012 Russian scientists report that they have successfully drilled to the surface of the lake and pierced the ice sheet, however, many in the scientific world are concerned about their method, which entails using kerosene to keep the borehole open. The fear is that only taking samples from the top of the lake will be insufficient for proper analysis, making the possible contamination a large risk with little benefit. The concern is that a mere surface sample will tell scientists nothing regarding the depth of the lake, or anything about the sediment, which could hold vital information, and that the kerosene could compromise the samples and skew data. Regardless, the lake has been reached, and the unconfirmed word is that there is a possibility of a “fundamental scientific development”. The Russian team is battling intense weather conditions, and communication is inconsistent and unpredictable, so the scientific community and the rest of the world can do nothing but wait until contact is reestablished to find out what, after 20 years of drilling, lies beneath the ice.",strange science martian landscapes intriguing environs geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems water geology nature
68,Marie Byrd Land,Antarctica,The largest piece of no man's land left on Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marie-byrd-land,"While much of Antarctica has been claimed by various nations, this large swath of uninhabitable territory goes unspoken for. The snowy expanse of Marie Byrd Land is the largest no man’s land on Earth. This uninhabitable Antarctic tundra was named by an explorer for his wife, and because no one else has claimed it, the name stuck. The area was christened by Admiral Richard E. Byrd, who led the first exploratory flight over the area in 1929. He named the area after his wife, Marie. The previously unresearched region was so inhospitable the crew was unable to camp there, and instead set up on the neighboring Ross Ice Shelf. Little has changed in the years since Byrd’s exploration. Marie Byrd Land remains one of the harshest climates on the planet, so inaccessible and rough that no sovereign nation has laid claim to it. Some expeditions have forged further into the area, but the only way explorers have been able to map out Marie Byrd Land in the years since has been from the air. Aerial photography has revealed a great deal about the region. Although it borders Antarctica’s highest point, Vinson Massif mountain, Marie Byrd Land is mostly made up of the Bentley Subglacial Trench, the lowest point on the continent. While no nations are fighting over this antarctic tundra, one man has attempted to claim Marie Byrd Land for himself. Supposedly through a loophole in the Antarctic Treaty—the document that dictates international relations regarding Antarctica—Travis McHenry laid claim to the region, named it the Protectorate of Westarctic, and sent letters to various countries informing them of his claim. McHenry hoped to create his own currency for his micro-nation, but thus far none of the nations he contacted have replied to him and his claim goes unrecognized.",surveyors antarctic micro-nations snow borders exploration deserts
69,Esperanza Base,Antarctica,The birthplace of the very first human resident born in Antarctica.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/esperanza-base,"This Argentinian colony made up of a mere 55 residents in the winter months is only one of two civilian settlements on the great white continent of Antarctica. Along with Villa las Estrellas, a Chilean colony with twice as many people, Esperanza is one of the rare examples of a community that chose to inhabit the desolate winds and snowy tundras down south—the other settlements are all military or scientific bases. A treaty established in 1959 bars member nations from establishing territorial claims, but both Esperanza and Villa Las Estrellas were established before the treaty, and therefore immune. Despite being a simple, civilian town that serves as home to only 10 families, Esperanza takes on an appearance similar to the serious military bases strewn about the snow. A smattering of bland, military-esque buildings (43 in all) are scattered around the settlement, no sign of outside activity seen, and with only one month out of the year delivering temperatures below freezing, none should be expected. It is here in Esperanza that Antarctica welcomed its very first official native in 1978, when a baby named Emilio Palma came into the cold, cold world—the son of a naval officer and his wife, Palma was the first human life to begin in a brutal corner of the world that has ended more than its share. A local cemetery houses the remains of several of the explorers who perished nearby. While considered a domestic community it still serves a research base, housing the facilities to support studies of limnology, glaciology, seismology, and oceanography, along with some of the more general sciences. To power these facilities, the colony burns through 4,800 US gallons of fuel per year.",cultures and civilizations
70,The Snow Tomb of Captain Robert Falcon Scott,Antarctica,The bodies of some early polar pioneers are still buried beneath the harsh snows of the Antarctic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-snow-tomb-of-captain-robert-falcon-scott-antarctica,"While Sir Ernest Shackleton is often heralded as the hero of polar exploration, he had many contemporaries, among them British naval captain Robert Falcon Scott, who along with four of his men is still buried under the snows of the Antarctic. In November 1912, on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica, the surviving members of Scott’s Terra Nova expedition were searching for their leader. Scott and his party had vanished into the snows the previous year - never returning from their quest for the South Pole. On November 12th, one of the group, physicist Charles Wright, saw “a small object projecting above the surface” of the snow. It was part of a tent. They had discovered the final resting place of Scott and two of his men, Henry “Birdie” Bowers and Edward Wilson. Scott lay between them, his diary recording their final days: “It seems a pity, but I do not think I can write more,” the last entry ran, “For God’s sake look after our people.” In his final starved, frostbitten days, Scott worried about the financial burden on the families he and his men had left behind. Edgar “Taff” Evans and Lawrence “Titus” Oates had died earlier on the return journey from the Pole, where the party of five had found to their dismay that they had been bested by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. Discouraged, they trudged back toward the coast, Evans dying on the descent of the Beardmore Glacier and Oates freezing to death on the Ross Ice Shelf. Oates, wounded and thus concerned he was a burden to the others, limped out of the tent into a blizzard on March 17th and was never seen again. But his noble suicide would not save Scott, Wilson, and Bowers, who by March 29th were all dead in the tent. They had died just 11 miles short of a food depot, but 11 miles in an Antarctic blizzard with -60˚ Celsius temperatures was close to an eternity. Why it was that Scott and his men perished has been debated ever since the discovery of their bodies, with most scholars pinning at least part of the blame on Scott’s decision-making, while others point to a series of random misfortunes, coupled with atrocious March weather. Only one other expedition had experienced similarly impossible conditions, a three-man team of Wilson, Bowers and Apsley Cherry-Garrard setting off in the Antarctic winter on a quest for Emperor penguin eggs. The three were extraordinarily lucky to have survived; Cherry-Garrard recalled his teeth chattering so violently that they shattered. The bodies of Scott and his men were not brought back to Britain. Instead, wrote Cherry-Garrard, who had been part of the search party, “We never moved them. We took the bamboos of the tent away and the tent itself covered them. Over them we built the cairn.” This cairn of snow, topped with a solitary cross, was all that marked the remote spot in the Antarctic emptiness which has not been seen for over 100 years. The grave site was quickly buried in drifting snow, while the tent and bodies have been migrating downward into the ice under the weight of accumulating snow and seaward with the ice shelf toward the Ross Sea. A more permanent monument to Scott and his men was erected on Observation Hill near McMurdo Station, but given time, it is likely that, encased deep within an iceberg, the bodies of Scott, Bowers, and Wilson will slowly drift away out to sea.",polar week exploration tombs graves gravestones

The inspiration for the garden was the oldest sculpture in the collection, “Man Sculpted by Antarctica,” known locally under the nickname “Fred the Head.” This work was sculpted by a plumber on the base named Hans in 1977, and thus pre-dates the sculpture garden.

72,Mawson's Huts,Antarctica,These abandoned huts still hold the remains of an early 20th century Australian researcher's work.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mawsons-huts,"Sitting on the edge of Cape Denison in Antarctica is a small group of huts that were built by Australian antarctic explorer Douglas Mawson in the early 20th century. However, they have been abandoned for decades, preserving much of the effects and decor of the original expedition. Constructed between 1911-1914, the small research station is now known simply as the Mawson Huts. It stands as one of the last outposts left from the so-called Heroic Era of Antarctic Exploration, and the only one created by Australians. Mawson and his team of 17 men, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, travelled to Commonwealth Bay to conduct experiments on a variety of subjects including continental drift, local wildlife, and glaciation. Given the harsh climate, life in the huts was miserable. Blizzards and hurricane force winds were the norm, and communication was difficult despite a radio relay that was set up on a nearby island. Mawson would later write of the experience, saying, “Temperatures as low as -28 degrees F. (60 degrees below freezing-point) were experienced in hurricane winds, which blew at a velocity occasionally exceeding one hundred miles per hour. Still, air and low temperatures, or high winds and moderate temperatures, are well enough; but the combination of high winds and low temperatures is difficult to bear.” When the expedition left the site, they left their huts in place and headed out. The site simply sat in the cold and wind for two decades. They were briefly used in the 1930s, then abandoned once again. A number of the huts succumbed to the harsh winter conditions, but the main hut and the adjoining magnetograph house are still intact, retaining some of the original equipment such as the iron stove. While reaching Mawson’s Huts is not exactly easy, they remain there for any enterprising explorer interested in paying a visit. They are a protected historic site, so if the weather doesn’t destroy them, they should be there for some time to come.",abandoned research stations science abandoned
73,Chapel of the Snows,"McMurdo Station, Antarctica","The place of worship erected not once, but three times in one of the most desolate places on Earth.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapel-of-the-snows,"Chapel of the Snows, not originally planned for McMurdo Station, was built as a non-denominational Christian church by the seasonal residents of the station, and is the southernmost religious building in the world. The desolate McMurdo Science Station, while home to a mere 200 humans during the winter months, can get up to a bustling population of 1,000 during Antarctica’s version of summer. A modest chapel that can hold up to 63 souls at a time, Chapel of Snows does its best to accommodate the spiritual needs of all who brave the brutal environment to work in one of the harshest science centers on earth. Holding regular Catholic and Protestant services, the chapel also provides a place for Buddhists, Latter Day Saints, and followers of Baha’i to meet, and serves as a gathering place for Alcoholics Anonymous. While designed to be a place of solace, the chapel has had its share of trials. In 1978, the church was devastated by a fire that started in the rear heater room, and despite the valiant efforts of the fire crew and volunteers throwing snow on the smoldering building, it was a total loss. Mourning the loss of historic memorabilia from winter crews past, but counting their blessings that no one was injured, volunteers pulled together scrap materials and built a temporary replacement. A refurbishing of McMurdo Station was planned by the National Science Foundation, and a new chapel was included in the design. The new, 2,016-square-ft structure was dedicated in March of 1989 in an hour-long ceremony that attracted an overflowing crowd. The temporary chapel built by the community was left abandoned until it too, suffered a fiery demise during a Condition 1 storm in 1991.",polar week architectural oddities architecture

Named and mapped by New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE), 1958–59, because it was on this feature that Dr. Edward A. Wilson and his party built a stone shelter during Robert Falcon Scott’s British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13 - Scott and Wilson’s last. Ed Wilson, Birdie Bowers, and Apsley Cherry-Garrard set out from Cape Evans in the middle of the Antarctic winter on foot and sledge, a 70-mile journey. They endured extreme cold, frostbite, starvation, and near-death so they could be the first to collect emperor penguin eggs from the colony at Cape Crozier. The party ran into foul weather, lost a tent, and built a makeshift shelter out of rocks where they lay face down for three days waiting for the weather to clear. Their incredible journey is chronicled in Cherry-Garrard’s “The Worst Journey in the World.” The “igloo” now looks like a ring of rocks filled with the tatters of the nearly failed expedition: penguin parts, shreds of canvas, wind-worn wool clothing, a test tube, rope, and rusted tin cans, all perfectly preserved by the Antarctic cold.

75,East Base,Antarctica,One of America's oldest Antarctic research bases is abandoned but still just waiting for visiting explorers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/east-base,"Getting things built in Antarctica is no easy feat and getting rid of them isn’t much easier, which probably explains the number of research bases that were simply abandoned on the ice. In fact, one of America’s earliest outposts on the continent, East Base on Stonington Island, is still just sitting there waiting for anyone bold enough to visit. First built in 1939 by the United States Antarctic Service, East Base was commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, along with a sister base at another location. A team of researchers wintered at the base testing just about anything they could think of including seismic readings, aurora activity, tidal patterns, and the magnetic fields. The Americans evacuated the base in 1941, leaving behind most of the equipment in the hopes that they could return at a later date and continue the work. While the government never ended up sending another group to the station, a private expedition made use of the base in 1947-48, although when they evacuated, they too simply abandoned the huts. After the private researchers left the base was simply left to freeze, along with the hundreds of pieces of equipment that were left behind on the site, creating a perfect time capsule of the research of the time. There was another base nearby that was established by the United Kingdom (Base E) that was in use for decades longer, but the American base simply sat. Today, the remains of the base are still there and are designated as a historic site. It’s not easy to get there of course, but anyone willing to make the trip can check out the huts and see one of the rarest pieces of U.S. history.",abandoned research stations abandoned
76,Allan Hills,Antarctica,An ice field known for harboring an infamous Martian meteorite turned out to contain the oldest air on Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/allan-hills,"On December 27, 1984, a meteorite was found in the ice field near Allan Hills, a rocky outcrop that protrudes from the blue ice in Victoria Land, East Antarctica. Cosmo-chemical analyses back in the lab revealed a Martian origin. Years later, this meteorite, known as ALH84001, gained popularity as an article published in the journal Science reported structures in the rock and interpreted them as fossilized lifeforms, which, if true, would be the first definitive sign of extraterrestrial life. A media storm ensued, followed by a televised statement by then-President Bill Clinton. The scientific community never fully accepted the claim, however. One concern was the contamination by terrestrial materials. Another is the speculative nature of morphology-based inferences and the lack of more conclusive evidence. The proponents of the extraterrestrial-life hypothesis did not back down. The original paper from 1996 has been cited more than 2,000 times, and to this day, research into ALH84001 is still ongoing. In light of the media attention it receives, ALH84001 is arguably the most well-known meteorite of any kind. Decades later, another discovery from Allan Hills made headlines as a team of scientists found air trapped in the ice buried near Allan Hills that could be up to 2.7 million years old. Yet, according to the paper published on journal Nature in 2019, it appears that the chemical composition of certain pockets of air had been modified by microbial activities, resulting in elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide and a 50 percent depletion of molecular oxygen. Thus, the oldest “pristine” air without any biological perturbation is more likely to be 2 million years old. While the new record was pushed back by some 700,000 years, it still more than doubled the previous “oldest air” record of approximately 800,000 years. The composition of the 2-million-year-old air does not differ much from that of the air we breathe today, other than the air inside that ice having 30 percent less carbon dioxide than modern air. (This excess of carbon is due to man-made emissions from fossil fuel burning.) If one were able to breathe the trapped air, it would not be possible to tell the difference, at least in theory. According to the driller who drilled the ice in the field, the “drinks tasted so good with this old ice” although no scientific evidence has been provided in support of this claim. The presence of meteorites and very old ice near Allan Hills is linked to the same glaciological principle. Near Allan Hills, ice flows along with a rising bedrock topography towards the surface, where ferocious katabatic winds (winds produced by the flow of cold dense air down a slope under the force of gravity) blow the ice away through ablation, leaving the meteorites trapped in the ice behind. This dynamic feature exhumes crystalline glacial ice that is otherwise buried deep in the ice sheets. However, where the 2-million-year-old ice was originally deposited remains unclear. All that is known is that the ice must be brought to Allan Hills from somewhere else.  No one can predict the age limit of the oldest ice near Allan Hills or knows if even older ice would emerge in other places with similar glaciological features.  As every site in Antarctica, Allan Hills is difficult to access. The ""easiest"" approach by far is to submit a scientific proposal and (hopefully) get funded. If you do, you will likely head to McMurdo Station first to receive proper training before being transported to this remote field site by a fixed-wing aircraft. Alternatively, it may be possible to traverse over the ice to reach this location in a motorized convoy, but cautions must always be taken in Antarctica.",meteorites aliens ice fossils

Massive active glaciers cover the main island, which stretches nearly 100 miles long and reaches 6,445 feet at its highest peak.

The isles are inhospitable; the rocky lands constantly battered by some of the harshest winds on Earth. Despite the unforgiving climate, the Bossière brothers sent a couple shepherds and their families to an isolated peninsula within the archipelago, where they were meant to experiment with keeping sheep on such unwelcoming lands. The shepherds settled within Port Couvreux, but their tenure on the island was short-lived. Many of the sheep died during transport, and the rabbits brought over as a food source ran wild and wreaked havoc on the environment. As the dawn of World War I approached, the settlers left their isolated outpost to return to France. This failed endeavor didn’t put an to the Bossière brothers’ plans to populate the islands. In 1920, they once again shipped more shepherds and sheep off to the faraway archipelago. The settlers built houses and a small farm, attempting to turn Port Couvreux into a successful colony. But again, the livestock couldn’t survive in such a cold, barren climate. Even the people began to perish, some dying in the cold while foraging for food while others succumbed to illness. The last survivors were evacuated in 1931. Scattered ruins and a little cemetery are all that remain of their time in Port Couvreux. There is also another tomb near Port Couvreux, at Bassin de la Gazelle, of a German marine soldier who died accidentally in 1940.",colonialism islands abandoned

Back in 1761 a French ship was ferrying around 160 enslaved men and women out of Madagascar, bound for French plantations. While slavery was legal at the time, the captain was not approved as a slaver and so was likely trying to finish his illicit deal quickly. It’s possible that this haste contributed to the wreck of his ship, but either way, not long into their voyage, they ran into the reef surrounding Tromelin Island while trying to navigate it in the dark. The hull was destroyed and water rushed into the cargo hold drowning the majority of the poor souls below deck, however some 60 of the captives were able to swim to safety. Using the wrecked debris from the ship, two camps were made, one for the crew and one for the people they had enslaved. Eventually, the crew men were able to create a new boat out of the debris of the old, but it only had room for the crew. The crew sailed back to Madagascar, vowing to return for the enslaved people, but they must have gotten side-tracked as no one returned for 15 years. The shipwreck survivors kept themselves alive by eating turtles and crabs that came to the island to nest. They built simple shelters by digging rooms into the ground and fortifying them with rocks. They used remaining debris from the ship to fashion small tools, and bowls. It is reported that a group was eventually even able to create a raft that was powered by a sail made of feathers, although its passengers are thought to have died at sea. When a rescue boat was finally sent to the island all those years later, only seven women and child less than a year old remained. The tragic events of Tromelin Island are not remembered by any marker, and the remains of the ship have all but been swept away by the tides, but the remains of the castaways’ shelters and artifacts can still be found on the island.

The doves flock on the trees, the roof, and the sidewalks. Legend has it the mosque is so sacred that any dove with a speck of color on its feathers will instantly become pure white after entering the mosque’s vicinity. According to legend, a Middle Eastern mullah (scholar of Islam) had a dream that Ali bin Abi Talib, the son-in-law and cousin of the prophet Muhammad, had his bones resting in what is now northwestern Afghanistan. Captivated by his story, Ahmad Sanjar, who was the Sultan of the Seljuq Empire from 1118 to 1157, constructed the Shrine of Ali in northwestern Afghanistan. He even constructed a city around the shrine, called Mazar-i-Sharif, to which thousands of religious Muslims migrated. Unfortunately, a century after the shrine was built, Genghis Khan made his westward push. When he reached Mazar-i-Sharif, Khan completely destroyed the shrine. But it wasn’t gone for long. In 1481, Sultan Husayn Mizra rebuilt the Shrine of Ali in an even grander fashion, in the form of a giant blue mosque which still exists to this day. When you look at it, the structure appears to be floating, a trick of Islamic architecture, which uses intricately painted clay tiles. The tiles constantly need to be replaced — two square feet every day — from exposure to the natural elements and because the corners of certain tiles are often stolen by pilgrims as religious mementos. The Blue Mosque offers a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of Mazar-i-Sharif’s streets and bazaars. It is consistently quiet, except for when the muezzin makes one of the daily calls for prayer.",mosques islam temples birds religion sacred spaces animals history
81,Site of the Bamiyan Buddhas,"Bamyan, Afghanistan","Once an impressive link to Afghanistan’s Buddhist past, now a sad reminder of intolerance towards other cultures.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/site-bamiyan-buddhas,"Few man-made destructions of cultural heritage have been blatant as the bombing of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban in 2001. Prior to the destruction, the Giant Buddhas had already been worn down from decades of war and neglect, but it only took a few minutes to wipe out the remnants of Afghanistan’s most majestic pre-Islamic site. Since their creation in the 6th century, the Bamiyan Buddhas have been the largest Buddha statues west of China, and rose majestically out of the otherwise featureless plains of Central Afghanistan. There were two main statues, 53 and 35 meters high respectively, that portrayed a Vairocana Buddha and a Shakyamuni Buddha. A number of smaller Buddha statues adorned the surrounding area. Surrounding the statues were also several undecorated monastic cells, which had been, just as the Giant Buddhas, hewn into the cliffs. Immediately after the hottest stage of the war against the Taliban in 2002, first steps of reconstructing the Buddhas were made, and the entire area has been thoroughly researched, tagged and mapped for the reconstruction. During this process a number of brightly painted Buddhist caves were rediscovered. In 2008, a previously unknown 19 meter long statue of a Reclining Buddha was uncovered during the search for a semi-mythological 300 meter long Reclining Giant Buddha that is reputedly hidden in the region. The 300 meter long Buddha was mentioned by a Chinese monk in the 7th century, and given his detailed description of the two standing Buddhas, historians did not entirely dismiss his remarks on the third. If this statue truly existed and was rediscovered, it would be by far the largest Buddha statue in the world. When the Taliban decided to destroy the Buddhas, it caused an outcry from the international community. Several countries tried to prevent the Taliban from destroying the Buddhas by various offerings, such as buying the statues and relocating them to another country. But since the Taliban were not willing to consider these propositions, the world had to helplessly witness the bombardment of the ancient colossals. Given the worsening of the security situation in the country within the last few years, it does not seem likely that the Giant Buddhas are to be rebuilt anytime soon. Even UNESCO shattered hopes that the reconstruction of the once world-famous World Heritage Site would take place in the near future, stating that it would likely be a long-term project. Thus, the bare rock niches, which once held the Giant Buddhas, will for now continue to serve as a stark reminder of the ignorance toward other cultures and the loss of an important survivor of Afghanistan’s pre-Islamic history.",giant buddhas lost tribes sacred spaces ruins
82,Stupa of Takht-e Rostam,"Aybak, Afghanistan",Highly unusual subterranean stupa and adjacent cave monastery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stupa-takhte-rostam,"There are places in the world so strongly devoted to a particular religion that it is incredibly hard to believe that they have been shaped by any other faith. Afghanistan is one of those places, a country so devoutly Islamic that it seems that Islam has been around since the beginning of time - However before the advent of Islam, Afghanistan was an important center of Buddhist teaching. To find remnants of this Buddhist past, one has to search extremely thoroughly. The once rich excavation sites have turned to rubble after decades of war and neglect, the museum collections have been looted or irreparably damaged, and the Bamiyan Buddhas – once the country’s strongest reminder of its Buddhist past – were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. Since the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas, the Stupa of Takht-e Rostam in Samangan Province is arguably Afghanistan’s most impressive pre-Islamic site. Unlike other stupas, the one of Takht-e Rostam has not been mounted above ground, but it has been carved into the ground, in a style that resembles the monolithic churches of Ethiopia. At the top of the stupa is a stone-carved Harmika building, which once held relics of the Buddha. The trench surrounding the stupa is around eight meters deep. A path leads down to the bottom of the trench, where Buddhist monks once clockwise circumnavigated the stupa. Carved inside the outer walls of the trench is a Buddhist monastery with five individual caves and several monastic cells for meditation. Small holes in the roofs allow a little daylight to enter the caves, creating a peaceful atmosphere of twilight. The cave monastery is lacking any decorative elements, but is impressive for its sheer engineering feat. Historians have proposed two possible reasons, as to why the stupa has been carved in the ground, instead of being built above ground. One explanation is that it could have been done for the purpose of camouflage to protect the monastery from invaders. Another much more mundane explanation states that it has simply been done to escape the excessive climate extremes of Afghanistan. The Afghan name Takht-e Rostam (Throne of Rostam) refers to a legendary figure in Persian culture. After the Islamization of Afghanistan, when the knowledge of the original purpose of the stupa became lost, the site became known as the place where Rostam supposedly married his bride Tahmina. The ruins are located up the hill 3 km southwest above the town of Samangan.",lost tribes cultures and civilizations subterranean sites monuments sacred spaces ruins architectural oddities architecture
83,Band-e Amir Lakes,"Yakawlang, Afghanistan",Splashes of blue in an otherwise monotonous lunar landscape.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/band-e-amir-lakes,"The lakes of Band-e Amir are an incredibly stunning sight. Six deep blue lakes suddenly appear like sparkling jewels in the middle of the barren grey wasteland of Central Afghanistan that stretches as far the eye can see. The lakes’ waters are composed of a high mineral content, which is responsible for the deep blue colour of the lakes. Travertine walls between and around the lakes have created natural dams, that store the rainwater, which flows from the cracks and fissures of the surrounding rocks. Around the shore of the lake Band-e Haibat the travertine walls reach a height of twelve meters, creating an otherworldy effect of some sort of natural infinity pool. The overspilling water of the lake creates small waterfalls along the outer rim of the travertine walls. According to local legend, the lakes were formed as the result of a series of miracles performed by Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed, which left the local king so amazed that he immediately decided to convert to Islam. A shrine to Ali to honour his miraculous works stands on the shore of one of the lakes. If one day the tourism industry in Afghanistan gets going, the Band-e Amir lakes are likely to become the country’s prime tourist attraction. Even today, the lakes are a favorite destination for day trips, and they exude an often joyful and almost festive atmosphere – a rarity in Afghanistan, which makes the lakes popular among locals and expats alike. This atmosphere at the lakes is a unique reminder of the days when Afghanistan was firmly placed on the tourist map, as the country was part of the famous Hippie Trail from Istanbul to Northern India. In 2009, the country’s first national park was created around the vicinity of the lakes. While still open to visitors, there is harsh terrain, mined unpaved roads, and no real basic facilities. Only a thin track of road is safe to travel on, so adventure wisely.",martian landscapes geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems water geology nature
84,Herat National Museum,"Herat, Afghanistan","Despite a history of destruction, this former citadel survives to document Afghanistan's oft overlooked history.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/herat-national-museum,"No one knows Herat’s exact age, but it was most likely founded as an outpost of the Achaemenid Empire (550-330BC) and named Aria. Alexander the Great’s army overran the Persians, and changed the name to Alexandria-of-the-Arians. On a strategic hill in the center of town sits the restored ruins of Qala Iktyaruddin (Persian: قلعه اختیارالدین‎): the Citadel of Herat (Persian: ارگ هرات‎, Pashto: سکندرۍ کلا). In 330 BCE it was also known as the Citadel of Alexander, and it is quite likely the oldest building in the city. It was destroyed by Genghis Khan’s Mongol army in 1221 CE, and then rebuilt in its present form by the Kart Governor Malik Fakhruddin in 1305 CE, only to be destroyed again by Tamerlane in 1380 CE. Tamerlane’s son, Shah Rukh, used 7,000 men to embellish the walls and repair the damage wrought by his father. It then became the heart of the Timurid Empire (1405-1506). In more recent times it has served as a military garrison and prison for various dynasties and regimes and was thus closed to visitors from the outside world until 2005 when the Afghan Army presented it to the Ministry of Information, Culture, and Tourism. Between 2006 and 2011 the Aga Khan Trust, with grants from the USA and Germany, completely restored the structure. The National Museum of Herat is housed in the lower Citadel. The Museum of Islamic Art in Berlin worked with the German Archaeological Institute to document and restore artifacts and prepare them for display. The museum was opened to the public in October of 2011. There are about 1,100 items from the Herat region in the museum, of which there are about 250 on display. Most are from the 10th to 13th centuries when Herat was at the height of its political and cultural significance. There is pottery, metal work, the tombstone of Behzad, the famous painter of Persian miniatures, old manuscripts and books and a cenotaph adorned with tiles that date from 1378. The collection includes old muskets and cannon, and very curious three-dimensional replicas of some of Behzad’s most famous miniatures. The museum has long, well-lit, archways and arcades of brown brick. Though smaller than the Kabul Museum, the setting feels more architecturally unique, and it is in keeping with the restoration of the Citadel as a whole. Even though Herat is one of the safest cities in Afghanistan, it is still probably not advisable for the average Central Asian tourist to include it on their itinerary. Only those already well experienced with the delicate intricacies of Afghan travel should even attempt a visit until the tourism infrastructure has been somewhat restored. The Citadel of Herat sits on a quite visible hill within the walls of the old city.",unesco fortresses museums
85,OMAR Mine Museum,"Kabul, Afghanistan",A sobering museum dedicated to landmines and the personnel working to remove them from Afghanistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/omar-mine-museum,"The OMAR Mine Museum in Kabul displays 51 of the 53 types of landmines used in Afghanistan. It also houses a variety of other military hardware from wars fought in the country in recent decades. Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Most of the mines’ victims are innocent civilians. Tragically, the buried weapons claim the lives of far too many curious children. The Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation (OMAR) was formed in 1990 to help combat the issue. Its team of about 500 people performs the rather stressful job of removing landmines from the earth within Afghanistan. A plain white brick building in Kabul houses their findings. Besides landmines, the museum also holds cluster bombs, rockets, unexploded ordnance, and airdrop bombs. There are even Russian “butterfly” mines, which children often mistook for plastic toys because they were made in a wide range of vibrant colors. The grounds surrounding the museum contain an interesting collection of rockets, surface-to air-missiles, and aircraft including helicopter gunships and an MiG fighter. If the museum isn’t a sobering enough experience, a memorial plaque inside honors the bravery of those who’ve died removing landmines in the area. Due to security reasons you cannot visit this museum without an appointment but this can be arranged through the main OMAR office in Kabul. There is a hefty charge of around $20 for photography but presumably it helps toward landmine clearance.",bombs weapons war history collections military museums and collections museums

Amanullah Khan, ruler of Afghanistan between 1919 and 1929, ordered the construction of the impressive structure, intending the palace to be the centerpiece of a new capital city in the country.  The city was to be a gleaming, European-style settlement, rising up from the plains with the palace as the crown jewel. Needless to say, the city was never built and the palace never came into its own. The conservative rulers who deposed Amanullah Khan scorned his plans and his reforms, leaving Darul Aman to rot. Set on fire in the 1970’s, shelled by mujahideen in the 1990’s, and targeted by the Taliban in 2012, the palace, once a symbol of optimism and change, was repeatedly brutalized. Still standing today, Darul Aman is now a crumbling ruin. A plan to restore it has so far come to nothing but its walls still contain the last century of Afghan history: the grandeur of its ambitions, the depth of its bloodshed and violence, an ultimately a monument to the improbable resilience of hope.",palaces abandoned ruins
87,Chilzina and the Forty Steps of Kandahar,"Kandahar, Afghanistan","Rock-cut chamber at top of an outcroup, reached by a mountain stairway of forty steps.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/forty-steps-kandahar-chilzina,"Sometimes, simplicity speaks volumes. A short tower can seem imposing on a featureless plain. A tiny word can say a lot if it’s on a blank wall. And 40 simple steps can tell a complex story of perseverance and dominance, if they’re carved into the mountainside leading to its peak. That’s the scene at Chilzina, otherwise known as the “Forty Steps of Kandahar.” Carved into a mountain peak at the western boundary of what was “Old Kandahar” (conveniently located in the same place as the current Kandahar), this monument was an imposing symbol etched upon the natural defense formed by Kandahar’s western mountains. And the man who put them there knew exactly what he was doing. Babur was the first emperor of the Mughal Empire, and he did not come by that title lightly. He literally bent the world before him to his will, conquering much of central Asia and the Indian subcontinent to form his empire and expand the influence of his Persian culture. A descendant of both Timur and Ghenghis Khan, Babur wanted people to know his name as well. Thus at Chilzina, he carved a staircase into a mountain and hollowed out an enclave for recording his history. Into the wall of that enclave, Babur carved the story of his conquests in the Mughal Empire in Persian for all to see. He then carved statues of two lions, chained, at the top of the stairs, guarding the entrance to the enclave. While the staircase is impressive indeed and the inscription is the point of it all, the lions remain the best example of his legacy. Because they were chained, even these guardians, shaped purposefully and painstakingly out of bare stone, signified his power and control over them, there at his service, just as he saw the world around him.",subterranean sites caves ecosystems monuments
88,Marjan the Lion Memorial,"Kabul, Afghanistan",This monument honors the life of a long-suffering lion whose story captivated the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marjan-the-lion-memorial,"Before the mid-1990s civil war in Afghanistan, the Kabul Zoo housed many exotic animals. Unfortunately, most were killed or escaped during the fighting. But some remained in captivity, in dire conditions, throughout the surrounding conflicts. The zoo’s most celebrated former resident was Marjan the lion (“marjan” means “coral” in Persian). There are multiple claims about his age—some say he was born in the ‘60s, other reports claim the ‘70s. The Cologne Zoo donated him to the Kabul Zoo, the kingdom he shared for the majority of his life with a lioness named Chucha. Marjan’s story is not a happy one. In 1995, a man (some say a guerilla soldier) either attempting to prove his bravery or for a bet, climbed into Marjan’s enclosure. Although Chucha permitted the man to stroke her, Marjan was not so tolerant of the intrusion and pounced upon the man, subsequently mauling him to death. The following day, the brother of the dead man exacted his revenge by throwing hand grenades at Marjan, who instinctively jumped on one of them. The resulting blast left the lion lame, blind, deaf, and with half his teeth blown out. Despite his injuries, the cat survived and lived for another seven years—unlike the grenade-thrower, who was attacked and killed for his actions a week later. Marjan’s story captivated animal lovers around the world. Even as the warfare drove most people from Kabul and brought peril to every day within the city, dedicated caretakers did all they could to ensure the lion remained fed and comfortable until he died of old age in 2002. Marjan is buried in Kabul Zoo, where a bronze memorial statue of him has been placed at the entrance. The lion has come to symbolize Afghanistan’s survival throughout its decades of hardships. An inscription on the memorial reads “Here lies Marjan, who was about 23. He was the most famous lion in the world.”",zoos cats death memorials monuments animals
89,Minaret of Jam,"Shahrak, Afghanistan",200-foot-high minaret and only remnant of Afghanistan's lost city of the Turquoise Mountain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lonely-minarete-of-jam,"For the last three decades, almost constant conflict has colored the world’s perceptions of Afghanistan, and an inhospitable climate and frightening political instability have left Afghanistan on few traveler’s itineraries. But before the war-torn reality of the country today, societies flourished, and left behind traces of their greatness. The minaret of Jam is one of these legacies. Built in the late 12th century, the minaret was once connected to a great mosque along the riverbank, and evidence of the building and a massive courtyard have also been found near the site. Some scholars have suggested that the minaret is the only remaining structure from the lost city of the Turquoise Mountain, one of the greatest urban civilizations of its time, and a bastion of tolerance, where all religions were accepted. The rest of the lost city perished during Mongol invasions in the 1220s possibly leaving behind only the minaret. Besides the semi-miracle of its survival, the minaret is an incredible work of architecture. Extending 213 feet into the air, the minaret is made completely of tan baked bricks and is intricately carved with Koranic inscriptions of multiple colors. In 2002, the minaret was nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, one of only two in all of Afghanistan. After staying intact for 1000 years, the minaret still faces threats from war, and the harsh climate of Afghanistan. The minaret of Jam is also currently listed as a site in danger, and many fear that another harsh winter, or earthquake could topple the only legacy of the city of Turquoise Mountain.",ruins
90,Tajbeg Palace,"Kabul, Afghanistan",The abandoned palace stands as a wounded but proud beacon of Afghan hope.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tajbeg-palace,"Tajbeg Palace stands atop a knoll dominating Kabul as a concrete allegory to Afghanistan’s recent past. Rusting wheels that once supported the manually-operated cable car that transported Queen Soraya to her husband in the nearby Darul Aman Palace share faded opulence with ornate architraves, hacked marble, and grammatically incorrect Taliban graffiti. Tajbeg Palace, which was designed in the 1920s by European architects, was the idea of Afghan leader Amanullah Khan as part of his modernization program. Informally known as the “Queen’s Palace,” Tajbeg was the home of Queen Soraya Tarzi, herself a modernist and instrumental in Afghan women’s rights until Amanullah’s untimely abdication in the face of increasing religious upheaval. In subsequent years, Tajbeg Palace was used as a military command headquarters and, as such, was a strategic target for belligerents in ensuing regime changes. Whoever sat in Tajbeg held symbolic control of the land around it. On December 27, 1979, Soviet Special Forces, as part of Operation Storm-333, attacked the palace and assassinated President Hafizullah Amin as a precursor to the 10-year Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Tajbeg became home to the Soviet Army 40th Division, then the following communist government, until Mujahideen factions, upon their taking of Kabul in 1992, used Tajbeg as their spiritual home. When the Taliban installed itself as the ruling party they used Tajbeg’s ornate windows and balconies as public execution posts. The Afghan government is once again in control of the battered palace. But due to insufficient funding, its plans to restore the building to its former glory have yet to come to fruition. Today, it’s the palace’s pockmarked exterior where poignancy now reigns. Even after suffering generations of instability and violence the building stands wounded, but proud, as a beacon of Afghan hope.  Access is dependent on current custodians.

91,Site of Alexandria on the Caucasus,"Bagram, Afghanistan",The West's first incursion into the Afghan world lies buried beneath a military base.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/site-of-alexandria-on-the-caucasus-afghanistan,"The Western world has had a number of troubles with the Afghan world in recent history, but one of the earliest attempts at colonization of the area has been all but forgotten to time. In 329 BC, Alexander the Great founded a city on what was, for him, the edge of the known world. Called Alexandria on the Caucasus, the city was established at the crossroads of ancient trade routes in the land which was to become modern-day Afghanistan. After the initial conquest, 3,000 veterans of his army remained behind to settle there while Alexander marched east to India. Many cities were founded by Alexander in his brief years of conquest and exploration, most famously Alexandria in Egypt, but Alexandria on the Caucasus has remained one of the most elusive to historians. A few years after founding this city, Alexander himself was dead in Babylon. His control of Afghanistan had always been fleeting at best and after his death the empire he had ruled over was fragmented. With the fallout of his death Alexandria on the Caucasus was swiftly forgotten by his successors in Babylon, Egypt, and Macedonia. Ancient accounts of this part of the world paint a picture of a wondrous, magical land: where a city founded by the god of wine himself lay nearby, there were men with no heads, and naked philosophers imparted wisdom. However the Alexandrian Caucasus empire gradually retreated into legend and speculation. The site of Alexandria on the Caucasus lay undisturbed for centuries, until it was rediscovered in July, 1833 by Charles Masson. Masson was an extraordinary character. A deserter from the British army and virtuoso con-artist, he wandered nineteenth-century Afghanistan in a succession of disguises: a faquir, a Frenchman, a spy, a Haji, an American, a healer. Masson recovered thousands of coins and artifacts from the site, many of which are now in the British Museum. Today there is little to be seen of Alexandria on the Caucasus, its remains mostly buried underneath Bagram Airbase, 65km north of Kabul. Despite its historic importance, there is almost nothing left to mark the site of the West’s first brief adventure in Afghanistan.",dead explorers cultures and civilizations politics ruins
92,Ishkashim Border Market,"Ishkashim, Afghanistan",A strip of neutral ground where the people of Tajikistan and Afghanistan come together to trade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ishkashim-market,"Crossing the border from Tajikistan to Afghanistan is often dangerous or outright impossible. But in Afghanistan’s panhandle-shaped Wakhan Corridor, anyone can freely cross the border—even those without a visa. Welcome to the Ishkashim Market, a strip of no man’s land where locals from both countries meet to buy and sell each other’s crafts. The mountainous Panj River is the dividing line between Ishkashim, Tajikistan, and the Afghan town of the same name on the other side. The river is a neutral ground between the two countries, meaning any structure in the center of the river is easily accessible for both Afghans and Tajiks so long as they return to their respective countries after visiting. The Ishkashim Market, located in the center of the Panj River, is exactly that. The border bazaar is accessible to locals from both sides, and occasionally foreign tourists in Tajikistan who have visiting Afghanistan on their bucket list drop by, too. To enter the market, no long immigration process is required; an armed guard will take your passport (preventing you from passing on to the Afghan side) and instruct you to cross a bridge to the market. Inside the Ishkashim Market, you can haggle for delicious food, Afghan trinkets, pakol hats, and Tajik souvenirs. In addition to handcrafted goods, foreign products can also be found, including cheap clothing and household items from China, and more disconcertingly, World Food Programme aid packages for sale. The market is also an optimal spot for people watching. The Ishkashim Market is open every Saturday, unless violence or disease are present in the area. Whenever it’s open, it’s a remarkable display that friendship and commerce can cross both rivers and borders.  Travel through Afghanistan is, of course, dangerous. But Ishkashim is at the base of the Wakhan Corridor, which is generally safe, as is the Pamir region of Tajikistan. You can obtain a tourist visa when you enter Tajikistan at the Dushanbe airport. You will then need to get a GBAO permit to travel to Khorog, the capital of the Pamir region. From there you can catch a bus to Ishkashim on the Tajik side.",borders markets immigration

That all changed in 1951, when the government of Afghanistan allowed all Afghani Jews to emigrate from the country without having to revoke citizenship, and in 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Because of factors like these, by 1996 the population of Jews in Afghanistan had dwindled down from over 5,000 to a meager 10. By the 21st Century, there was only one running synagogue in all of Afghanistan. In 2001 this synagogue, located on Flower Street in Kabul, was home to the last two remaining Jews in the entire country - Zablon Simintov and Ishaq Levin. They were famous for being arch-rivals, and repeatedly turned each other into the Taliban. This feud was the plotline for a New York City play entitled “The Last Two Jews of Kabul.” In 2005, the feud ended when Levin died of natural causes, leaving Simintov as the only remaining Jew in all of Afghanistan. Despite living in complete religious isolation, Simintov has remained in the country for the sake of identity and employment, even though his wife and two daughters live without him in Israel. The difficulties for Simintov’s day to day life are definitely prevalent. When it comes to food, for example, he has had to receive special permission from the nearest rabbi (who lives in Tashkent, Uzbekistan) to slaughter his own meat and call it kosher. Simintov’s Torah was stolen by the Taliban in the early 2000s. He has since focused his efforts towards tracing the stolen Torah to Guantanamo Bay, where he believes the thief is in US custody. Despite the day-to-day cultural awkwardness of living there, he has not budged from his home - he gets funds and care packages from international Jews and sympathetic Afghani Muslims, keeps the synagogue intact, and runs a kebab restaurant with all-Muslim chefs. Recently, his restaurant has been failing, which he blames on the US military’s withdrawal from the area.",afghanistan synagogue middle east synagogues jewish

Khan, along with many others in Herat, the city where the Soviets were defeated in the 1980s, believed the museum was necessary to educate a generation without a frame of reference about the uprising against the Soviet Union. Ostensibly, education is the goal of the museum. However, shock value seems to better sum up the collections and displays in the museum. Constructed in 2010, the museum is filled with paraphernalia from the insurrection and more notably, shocking dioramas depicting the violence. One model even shows and glorifies Soviets being executed in the dirt from point blank range. Another paint and model display shows Soviet soldiers splayed across tanks while being beaten to death with shovels. Along with the grisly dioramas, the museum also hosts a collection of weapons from the era. Russian uniforms are scattered about along with old AK-47s and allegedly, active land mines. Outside of the museum, the collection also has Russian helicopters and fighter jets, surrounded by a well kept garden on the grounds. Although a great deal of the museum seems intended to shock with gratuitous violence, there are some less graphic depictions of the Afghans’ struggle.

But when Australian skateboarders Oliver Percovich and Sharna Nolan arrived in Kabul in 2007, they could scarcely have foreseen the amount of interest their activities would generate. Everywhere that Percovich and Nolan went, they were surrounded by boys and girls of all ages, who wanted to learn how to skate. Despite having just three decks between them, they were able to open a rudimentary skateboarding school. Their success encouraged them to think bigger, and in October 2009 Skateistan, Afghanistan’s first skateboarding school, was opened. The school is built on land donated by the Afghan National Olympic Committee and caters to over 300 students, around half of whom are girls. Most Afghan sports, such as football and kite flying, are generally seen as male activities, but skateboarding is viewed by Afghans as a suitable activity for girls. The school also provides lessons to disabled children and offers classes in art, crafts, and multimedia. In 2011, a documentary about the school was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. Aside from functioning as a skateboarding school, Skateistan was officially registered as an Afghan NGO in July 2009. It works in collaboration with other charity organizations, where it “engage[s] Afghan children through skateboarding and provide[s] them with greater access to education, healthcare and cultural opportunities.” The park is located in the Afghan National Olympic Committee compound.",architectural oddities architecture

One place this increase in surveillance exists is hovering thousands of feet above Kabul, Afghanistan’s largest city. Imagine a giant floating eye 117 feet long and equipped with infrared and color eyesight. An eye which can watch over an entire city’s civilians 24 hours every day without sleeping or even blinking. This is Kabul’s giant blimp. Floating high in the Kabul skies, not disguised or hidden in any way, is a huge white blimp. Nicknamed “the dirigible,” this blimp belongs to the Americans, and it is tethered to the NATO Headquarters in Kabul. An average Kabul resident will see it every time he looks up, no matter what time. It’s always there, in plain sight for millions of people to see. There have been several positive effects that have come from the implementation of the blimp. For instance, on one occasion, the US military used the blimp’s cameras to find a car that was being packed with explosives, and fortunately, they were able to diffuse it in time. That said, many residents live in a state of fear. Mohammadullah, a resident of Kabul, was quoted in the New York Times saying “whenever we want to say ‘hi’ to our wife when we sleep on rooftops, we feel someone is watching us.” When the blimps are brought down due to bad weather, the military often finds hundreds of bulletholes in them, showing that the presence of the blimp is a cause of real resentment in the area. Some US Army leaders have even gone as far as saying that the blimps are ineffective at protecting American lives. The blimp did leave the skies for a short while. In October of 2015, a British military helicopter accidentally collided with one of the blimp’s tethers and crashed, killing five people, including two US soldiers. The blimp became deflated, and it couldn’t be used again. However that wasn’t enough to keep the zeppelin out of the skies. In January 2016, Truthout reported that a new blimp was up there, watching the city streets of Kabul just as it had in the past - business as usual.

These fires gave Azerbaijan the moniker “Land of Fire.” Even five centuries after Marco Polo, French writer Alexandre Dumas witnessed natural flames in a mysterious fire temple. One can easily understand how these natural flames must have amazed and terrified people in history, and it doesn’t come as a surprise that the natural fires of Azerbaijan are considered to have played a crucial part in the creation of Zoroastrianism — a mystical faith, centered around ceremonial fire cults, which appeared in the region around 2,000 years ago. The natural flames of Azerbaijan can be attributed to its enormous gas reserves. When exploitation of these reserves began, most of the natural fires burned out, due to a reduction in underground pressure. Of the natural fires that burn today in Azerbaijan, Yanar Dağ is arguably the most impressive. A 10m long wall of fire, that never extinguishes, is burning continuously alongside the edge of the hill, which naturally is at its most spectacular at night, when tourists and locals alike view the fire from a nearby teahouse.

Fire rituals at the peninsula’s numerous natural gas vents date back to at least the 10th century, although the current temple structure was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. The structure is similar to the caravanserais (travellers’ inns) of the region with pentagonal walls surrounding a courtyard. However, in the middle of this courtyard sits an altar, the centerpiece of the temple complex where fire rituals were observed. The altar is situated right a natural gas vent, igniting a large flame in the middle and four smaller flames on the rooftop corners of the pavilion. Surrounding the temple altar are a number of small cells which held the ascetic worshippers and pilgrims. Debate continues as to whether this temple was founded as a Zoroastrian or a Hindu place of worship, since the structure incorporates architectural elements from both faiths, without wholly adhering to either. The most established theory places the temple in the Zoroastrian tradition, but that it has evolved into a predominantly Hindu place of worship over time. In the late 19th century, the place was abandoned, most likely as a result of the dwindling Indian population in Azerbaijan. Heavy exploitation of the natural gas reserves on the peninsula resulted in the exhaustion of the flame in 1969. The flames seen today are fed by Baku’s main gas supply. In 1975, the complex was turned into a museum, and in 1998, it was nominated as an UNESCO World Heritage Site.",fiery wonders hinduism fires rites and rituals temples sacred spaces

The village provided flour to the fortress city of Shushi for over a century until it was abandoned in 1930. But the ruins remain: Twelve of the Hunot flour mills are preserved along the river in the now state-protected canyon. The walls of the gorge are more than 800 feet high, and from the highest point, known as the Jdrdyuz Plateau, visitors can enjoy the breathtaking view of the gorge before following one of several trails down into it. Stone Age caves and historic bridges (one of which, built in 1720, is still used) add to the beauty of the heavily forested canyon. At the bottom of the gorge, overlooking a natural swimming pool, is the base of a waterfall known as Mamrot Kar, which means “Umbrella,” in reference to the shapes of the moss-covered rocks the water falls over. This waterfall is the entrance to a grotto beneath the “umbrellas,” and simple bridges made of logs and large sticks allow access to the grotto from across the river.  The trail through the canyon and past the waterfall is marked, since it is part of the Janapar Trail—a two-week walk across the disputed territory of the Republic of Artsakh.

Called We Are Our Mountains, the looming faces of an old man and woman represent the mountain people of Artsakh and their Armenian heritage. The Republic of Artsakh (previously known as Nagorno-Karabakh) is a disputed territory in a landlocked region within Azerbaijan. Although internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan, it’s governed as a de facto independent state by its Armenian ethnic majority. Its original name, Nagorno-Karabakh, means “mountainous black garden.” We Are Our Mountains is an iconic monument within the unrecognized republic. The image of the monument caused controversy at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, initially due to its appearance in the semi-final introduction and subsequently because it was repeatedly shown by an Armenian spokesperson during the vote following an Azeri request that it be removed. Its image also features heavily in Artsakh’s coat of arms. Locals sometimes refer to it as “tatik-papik” (“grandma and grandpa”) for its two elderly faces. The sculpture, which was installed in 1967, is made from volcanic tufa.  The monument is a short and easy drive from Stepanakert. Visas are no longer required in advance for the Republic of Artsakh and are available upon arrival and registering in Stepanakert. Be aware, however, that these should be issued on a separate piece of paper rather than in your passport as any sign of having been to the region will deny any possibility of entering Azerbaijan or obtaining an Azeri visa.",territorial dispute micro-nations competitions borders politics monuments
101,Mud Volcanoes of Azerbaijan,"Baku, Azerbaijan","Home to nearly a third of the world's mud volcanoes, Azerbaijan is home to a messy, bubbling, and sometimes explosive landscape.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mud-volcanoes-of-azerbaijan,"In 2001, in Azerbaijan, something unexpected happened. The ground began to move in an unusual way… “It looked as though an animal was trying to get out of the ground […] There was a big explosion, and a huge flame started coming from the hillside […] The flame was unbelievably big, about three hundred meters high. It was surrounded by dense, black smoke, and lots of mud was being thrown into the air,” recounted a local. Visible from 15 kilometers (nine miles) away, three days later the flames were still burning. What had taken place was an eruption, not one of magma, but of mud. Known as “mud volcanoes,” they form in places where pockets of underground gas have found a weak spot in the earth where they can force their way to the surface. Because they are not caused by magma, the mud volcanoes, rather than being hot, can be very cold indeed, often just above freezing. Over a thousand mud volcanoes are known to exist in the world, and some 400 of those are in the coastal area of Azerbaijan. While mud volcanoes (also known as “sedimentary volcanoes”) never grow to the size of a normal volcano, topping out at around 10 km in diameter and 700 meters in height, (among the largest mud volcanoes in the world are Boyuk Khanizadagh and Turaghai, both in Azerbaijan) they do occasionally get the chance to show off, as happened in 2001. Every 20 years or so, one of these mud/gas volcanoes will ignite deep below the surface and create a massive explosion. While generally not dangerous to people, as they are far outside of most city centers, it is believed that six shepherds and over 2,000 sheep were killed by a mud volcano in Bozdagh, Azerbaijan. There is a silver lining to having a country covered in mud volcanoes. Mud volcanoes are closely associated with hydrocarbon and petrochemical stores underground, hence the gas trying to escape to the surface. A few of these gas leaks are constantly on fire, shooting small perpetual flames into the air and some believe that these perpetual flames are strongly connected to the appearance of the Zoroastrian religion in Azerbaijan some 2,000 years ago.",fiery wonders martian landscapes volcanoes geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems geology nature

The tiny library of books ins the museum is the result of the private collection of Zarifa Salahova, and has been amassed over the period of more than 30 years. In 2002, when she opened the museum, she finally shared her collection with the public. A large portion of the books also stem from the donation of a Ukrainian collector, who presented his petite books to Salahova in 2001. The museum has several thousands of the fairy-sized books, including miniature editions of works of Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Gogol, and Chukovsky. The books originate from around the world, and are written in numerous languages, including Azeri, Russian, English, and German. The oldest book in the museum is a miniature copy of the Quran, dating to the 17th century, while the smallest tome (6mm x 9mm) is the Russian book “The Most Miraculous Thing,” which can only be read by using a magnifying glass. Salahova, herself a dedicated bibliophile, opened the museum to motivate the next generation of readers to engage with reading and literature.

Collecting is one. People the world over pick a subject they like, start saving tokens they particularly like, and before long they have an array worthy of showing off. Construction is another. Instead of collecting objects, they build them, paint them, or cobble them together. These two hobbies don’t intersect often, but when they do, it’s always impressive. The Bottle House, a local icon in Ganja, Azerbaijan is a perfect example of this synthesis. An entire house ostensibly constructed entirely out of glass bottles, this abode is unlike any most will ever see. Mottled with shimmering colors, translucent in the summer sun, the Bottle House reflects and refracts light that passes through its walls like a prism in a window. The thousands of bottles that cover its walls are delicately placed to create works of art – mosaics that form portraits, words, and designs on every square inch of the building. The Bottle House is a private residence – there are no fees to take a look, but also no hours or official guided tours. That doesn’t stop numerous visitors and passers-by from coming to marvel at the feat of both engineering and creativity that were used to create it. Call it a collection, or call it a work of art, but the closest description of this house is that it’s both. Visitors can support the maintenance costs of the house by shopping at the homemade souvenir stand under the porch whenever open.

104,Candy Cane Mountains,"Siyazan, Azerbaijan",Swirling layers of white and red rock earned these mountains their festive nickname.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/candy-cane-mountains,"On the highway between Baku and Quba in Azerbaijan, a series of red-and-white striped peaks emerge suddenly from the surrounding landscape. Part of the Greater Caucasus mountain range, the Candy Cane Mountains earned their nickname thanks to their striking resemblance to the classic Christmas treat. The color of these rocks is a product of the area’s unique geology. The Candy Cane Mountains are made of shale, a type of sedimentary rock made up of many thin layers stacked on top of each other. Long ago, before the rock was formed, changes in the environment led to differing mineral composition as the layers of sediment were deposited. As the shale came in contact with water, layers that contained iron oxidized and turned red, while layers without iron remained shades of white and gray. Over time, tectonic movement and erosion have exposed these sedimentary layers into a visual representation of geologic history. The Candy Cane Mountains also contain many belemnites, fossils of an extinct order of squid-like creatures from the Cretaceous period.  The Candy Cane Mountains are located about 50 miles from Baku on E119. You can drive to the area or take a guided tour. The main area is located just off the road and there are a few small trails through the hills.

More than four hundred mud volcanoes are found within the area – half of all mud volcanoes in the world. Additionally, there are bizarre rock formations, burning gas vents, prehistoric petroglyphs – and the large musical stone, called Gaval Dash (Qavaldaş). Two meters long, the stone resonates a tambourine-like sound when it is “played” by hitting it with smaller stones. It is assumed to have been used since ancient times to play ritual melodies, used for the archaic Yallı chain-dance, which is portrayed at some of the petroglyphs at Gobustan – and which is still performed in Azerbaijan to this day. Other rocks in the Gobustan area have proven to have similar capabilities, which are thought to be the result of a combination of the unique climate and the effect of the natural gas within the region. A number of Azeri musicians have used the hypnotic sound of the rock to create pieces of music, partly in combination with other instruments, or chanting.

So naturally, the country is home to a museum dedicated to carpets and rugs—at the time of its establishment, the only one of its kind. The museum was founded in 1967 and originally housed in the Juma Mosque in the Old City district of Baku. In 1991 it was relocated to the former Lenin Museum on Neftchilar Avenue, and in 2014 it moved again to a new building in the seaside park. The current museum building, designed by the Austrian architect Franz Janz, is intended to resemble a massive rolled carpet. The Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum is home to the largest collection of Azerbaijani carpets in the world, some dating back to the 17th century, as well as archaeological artifacts and folk crafts, including ceramics, oil lamps, embroidery and jewelry. It also serves as a research site, where the art of traditional carpet weaving and its modern legacy are studied and discussed. On the first floor of the museum, visitors can walk through a timeline of Azerbaijani carpet weaving, from simple woven mats made from reed or cane to more complex woven forms. There are also weaving tools on display like looms, wool, ropes, and carpet bags. The second floor is filled with pile carpets, divided into distinct groups. Displays show information about common motifs found in Azerbaijani folk art, such as buta, dragons, the tree of life, different styles of crosses, and Islamic symbols. A 17th-century carpet called “Ajdahali,” the oldest carpet in the museum’s collection, is also on display here. The third floor focuses on modern carpeting, and how the art has developed through the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Among the artists featured is Latif Karimov, a prominent carpet designer and scientist who played a role in the establishment of the museum.  Entry is 7 AZN for adults, 3 AZN for students and free for children under 6. The museum is open every day except Mondays, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and to 8 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.",textiles crafts museums and collections museums

The phenomenon starts simply enough. Water comes gurgling from a metal stand-pipe inside a small pavilion, not looking particularly unusual. But when a lighter or another ignition source is touched to the water, the liquid itself will be set ablaze. This unique and entertaining property of the water is due to its uniquely high methane content.. Despite the methane in the water, water from the spring is said by locals to have remedial properties. People come from all over the region to collect water from the spring. Similarly, for tourists it has become almost a rite of passage to take a mouthful of the water while the top of the pipe is being set ablaze. The fire spring is but one of many weird sites in Azerbaijan that can be attributed to the country’s high gas and oil reserves. Aside from being a quirky attraction, the fire spring also evokes the spririt of Zoroastrianism, a religion in which fire and water are considered agents of ritual purity. Today, Zoroastrianism no longer exists in the country, but it was in this region that the religion was founded 2,000 years ago.

From the rubble of the fallen Russian behemoth, an Armenian autonomous nation called the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic arose in the nation of Azerbaijan, causing a vicious war that eventually left the town of Ağdam in ruins, completely abandoned and falling apart. Shells bombarded the town of 40,000, reducing many of the buildings to crumbling and smoldering remains. As the invasion raged through 1993, every resident was forced to flee the area. Once the town was abandoned, the Armenian military spitefully destroyed most of the remains of the town, so it could never fall into Azerbaijani hands again. Today, only the bombed-out skeletons of buildings remain, along with the former town’s mosque, which is badly damaged and was being used to house Armenian livestock. Although the area is no longer embroiled in conflict, Ağdam is a ghost town and is used as a buffer zone by the Armenian military.

Gorgeous but tiny, it was built as a prayer that the world’s revolutions would pass by the Caucasus. Unfortunately for the Shaki Khans, they didn’t. The Shaki Khans’ summer palace is located a few hours from Baku, an ancient city that today is rapidly replacing its stone buildings with glass skyscrapers. Perched high in the Caucasus mountains, the palace itself looks like the setting for a Wes Anderson movie. It is painstakingly symmetrical and more cosmopolitan than one might think for a mountain refuge. French stained glass, Russian wood, Ottoman ceramics, and Iranian mirrorwork decorate all of the facets. One can easily imagine the early 1800s, when the Shaki princes sat in its now-quiet halls, speaking of their grandeur. Those same princes spent their nights fearing what would happen when the world’s warlords would finally discover their corner of the mountains. Surrounded as it is by mile-high peaks, there is no good reason for Shaki to be targeted by an invading army. The town is located in what is now Azerbaijan, but for thousands of years, it remained a forgotten front as wars between the Ottoman, Russian, and Persian empires raged on all sides. Shaki’s rulers (called “khans”) were quite happy with this arrangement. They were free to sell their silk to the world, free from the greater region’s rampaging hordes. Today, visitors can march through the palace like the Russian army eventually did in 1819. You can gape at the tile work, which depicts the bearded Shaki cavalry bearing pikes topped with mustachioed heads, or squint at the sun setting into mirrors carved like a Tsarina’s ring. While getting lost in the delicate finery of the palace’s details, one finds the mind wandering into territory involving the intricacies of maintaining the daily rituals of a fantasy kingdom in the Caucasus, and what the invading army might have felt when they burst the Shaki’s bubble.",wes anderson stained-glass windows palaces architecture

Its odd design stands in stark contrast to the Soviet Modernist styles typically found throughout Baku. Inside, the building offers a tranquil environment full of white space and curved lines. The center contains a museum, gallery hall, and auditorium. Its fluid, folding walls are symbolic of its relationship with the physical and cultural landscape of the city. The entire design is meant to represent Azerbaijan’s dedication to blending its past with its future, as evidenced by the building’s slogan of, “To the future with values!” However, the center’s unconventional architecture and groundbreaking design weren’t the only things to put it on the world map.

No one is entirely sure when it was built, or for what purpose, or even the origins of the name. Yet this mysterious and curious tower is a symbol of Azerbaijan’s capital city and even appears on the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat. Many experts believe the tower was completed in the 12th century, along with most of the medieval walled city. But the different appearance of the stones that form the foundation and the first three stories suggests the original structure may date as far back as 600 BC. As this predates the arrival of the Islamic religion, it’s possible the building began as a Zoroastrian temple. It’s also been suggested that the tower could have been used as an astronomical observatory, speculation corroborated by the correlation between stone protrusions at the upper and lower levels and the lunar cycle. The Maiden Tower is 97 feet tall and 54 feet in diameter at the base, which narrows gradually moving upward. The truncated cone shape, thickness of the walls, and deep foundations are likely responsible for the longevity of the tower. Baku’s enigmatic tower has certainly taken hold of local folklore, being the stage where many popular legends unfold. The most famous of these tales tells the story of a king’s daughter who took her own life by jumping off the top of the tower to escape from a marriage of strategic convenience. According to the legend, this is how the tower acquired its name. Several variations of this story exist and have been expressed in the form of poems, plays, fairytales, and a famous ballet.  Inside the Maiden Tower is a museum dedicated to the history of the city of Baku.

More than two centuries prior to World War II, what were formally known as the Highland Jews in Azerbaijan lived in fear of their own neighbors and members of competing religious factions. Unable to gain a foothold in any majorly settled area, the Highland Jews found themselves unsupported and disproportionally scattered throughout the region. A decision was made to form a purpose-built settlement across the river from the region of Quba, where the strength of community and larger numbers might protect the Jews from undue hardships. Not long after the settlement began, an official status was formally proposed as the state of Yevreiskaya Sloboda, or Jewish Town, and the Khan of Quba granted the town protected status, allowing the continued organization and settlement of Jewish citizens in large numbers without fear of discrimination, retribution, or clashes with neighboring towns and states. The ensuing history of the town would closely follow the major events of Eastern Europe as a whole, with citizens once again fearing for the worst as renewed fighting and waves of persecution swept through the Jewish communities of the continent at large. At the outset of World War II, the Jews of Yevreiskaya Sloboda were relatively shielded from the horrors of Nazi-occupied Europe due to the town’s location inside the newly-formed Soviet Union. To reflect that association, the town’s name was officially changed to Krasnaya Sloboda, or Red Town. Today, Yevreiskaya Sloboda faces the new and daunting challenge of a dwindling population, as a majority of its citizens have left for Israel or other now-safe locations in Europe or North America. At its height, nearly 18,000 Jews inhabited Yevreiskaya Sloboda, but the town’s numbers now barely surpass 3,500.

In Azerbaijan, a country whose wealth has been built around its vast oil and gas reserves, and has been known since ancient times as the “Land of Fire,” people seem to be less concerned about the health risks of crude oil. On the contrary, in the small town of Naftalan, local oil is even regarded as having beneficial therapeutic effects, and people are happy to bathe in it. Naftalan, as local scientists eagerly point out, is the only place in the world in which oil has (allegedly) thermal qualities. Naftalan (literally translated as “taking the oils”) is thus the only spa town in the world where treatments do not involve water, but oil. Astonishingly, the first accounts of the healing oil of Azerbaijan were made by Marco Polo in the 13th century. He had never visited Naftalan, but noted in his travel accounts stories of magical therapeutic oil springs he had heard about in the area of today’s Azerbaijan. At the end of the 19th century, a German chemist began to export bottled oil from Naftalan, which soon became extremely popular in Russia and neigboring countries. The spa is not one of those contemporary ethereal beauty temples, but rather a clinical Soviet sanatorium-style affair. A number of treatments are offered, but the most popular is to simply bathe in the black stuff, which after a bathing session, is thoroughly scrubbed down the body. During the Soviet Union, when the spa town had its heyday, Naftalan was one of the most important spa towns in the Caucasus region, and received up to 75,000 visitors annually. Immediately after Azerbaijan’s independence, when relations with Russia notably cooled down and the Caucasus fell into a number of violent conflicts, Naftalan received very few guests. Back then, a number of the sanatoria had been turned into refugee camps for IDPs, who fled the horrors of the Armenia-Azerbaijan war. In recent years, the local government is working hard to restore Naftalan to its former glory, and hopes to attract Western tourists in the near future. The oil of Naftalan is claimed to be especially beneficial against psoriasis, arthritis and rheumatism.",strange science shops

Estimated at over 2,030 years old the tree has grown massive, with a circumference reaching almost 90 feet and a height of over 170 feet. The hollow trunk is reportedly big enough for more than 100 people to fit inside. Some suggest that Tnjri, which in the Karabakh dialect means plane-tree, is the largest plane-tree (Platanus orientalis L.) in the world. According to lore of the local Armenian population, the tree was said to have been visited by many Armenian greats, including the inventor of the Armenian alphabet, Mesrop Mashtots, in the 5th century; Armenia’s first historian, Movses Khorenatsi also in the 5th century; and the musician and poet Sayat-Nova in the 18th century. The size and age of the tree has also garnered the plant a spiritual significance among the local people, many of whom see the tree as sacred. There is even a legend that states that anyone who burns it down will die within seven days. This likely arose as a manner of protecting the ancient arbor since it has survived multiple close calls with arsonists trying to set it ablaze over the years. At one point the problem was so bad a full time guard had to be posted under the tree. Despite the many attempts at its life, Tnjri has survived through long eras and regimes. When the country was under Soviet control, Tnjri was said to be the tallest tree in Russia. However through it all Tnjri has remained an important shrine to the local people and a popular site for visitors looking a see a physical symbol of Armenia’s history.  By foot from Karmir Shuka (Red Market), visitors can follow the Janapar Trail up the hill to Tnjri. Blue markers (some with a yellow foot) denote the trail.

The first oil platform in Azerbaijan, Neft Daşları was also the first operating offshore oil platform in the world. What began as a single path out over the water in 1959 slowly grew into a full city over the years as paths and platforms were built on the back of ships that were submerged into the sea to serve as a foundation for the expanding structure. With a population of about 5,000 today, Neft Daşları is constructed on top of landfill, dirt, and other industrial detritus tossed out into the water. After two years of construction, in 1951, Neft Daşları was ready for production. Oil tanks were installed and drilling platforms erected and the city’s first oil was tanked out that same year. The city expanded so quickly in the first decade of operation that nine-story hotels, cultural palaces, bakeries, and other sites were built up by 1958. Two decades later another boom (1976-1978) saw the construction of a five-story dormitory and two oil-gas compressor stations. Those years also brought residents a drinking water facility, two underwater pipelines, and a flyover for vehicular traffic. When the 60th anniversary of Neft Daşları was celebrated in November 2009, it was announced that the city had produced, since its founding, more than 170 million tons of oil and plenty of natural gas. It’s unclear what will happen to the city and its residents when the oil reserves buried deep under the sea run dry. It is estimated that the reserves could hold only 30 million more tons.",natural wonders nature architectural oddities architecture

The hustle and bustle of Sadarghat can be overwhelming, with boats carrying produce, laborers unloading boxes, and a wild variety of vehicles transporting the goods to their next destination. The streets are packed, the smells pungent, the colors vivid, and the sounds disorienting. In the mayhem that is Sadarghat, the Ahsan Manzil compound is a fenced-off oasis of unexpected peace and quiet. Built between 1859 and 1872, Ahsan Manzil served as the residence of the Nawab of Dhaka. These days, the palace is a reminder of Bangladesh’s colonial past. Its ostentatious Western architecture incorporates elements of Mughal design, a popular trend among the affluent and aristocratic elite of Dhaka in the 18th and 19th centuries. After being largely abandoned upon the Newab’s death, Ahsan Manzil was restored and turned into a museum in 1985. The building is dominated by a large dome that caps an octagonal room, and a wide staircase leading to an arched portal. Along the façade of the building are porticoes that offer expansive views of the Buringa River. Apart from its architecture, Ahsan Manzil is famous for its bright pink color.  Ahsan Manzil is located on the north bank of the Buringa River, about 650 feet east of Babubazar bridge, along Gabtoli Road.",pink domes palaces museums history architecture
120,Lakkatura Tea Garden,"Sylhet, Bangladesh",One of the largest and most scenic of Bangladesh's tea gardens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lakkatura-tea-garden,"Sylhet, in the northeast of Bangladesh, is renowned for the beauty of its tea gardens, and among the lot, Lakkatura is considered the most scenic. It is also one of the largest tea gardens in the country, covering a total of 3,200 acres. This estate was officially established in 1875, and it now produces an astounding 550 tons of tea each year. A number of dirt roads intersect the garden, some purpose-built to transport tea across and beyond the grounds. Others are simply part of a larger network of roads cutting through Lakkatura, taking visitors through hills of neatly manicured rows of tea plants. Following the latter set of roads takes you to several rural villages in and around Lakkatura estate, including makeshift villages where migrant workers live during the harvest. The British East India Company first introduced tea cultivation in Bangladesh in 1840, but it was only in 1857 that tea became a commercial occupation. In 2012, Bangladesh produced more than 70,000 tons of tea. In spite of its small size, the South Asian country is the 12th-largest tea producer in the world, employing more than 300,000 people. The industry is supervised by the Bangladesh Tea Board and the Bangladesh Tea Research Institute.  Lakkatura Tea Garden is a few minutes from the center of Sylhet. The easiest way to get to the estate is by CNG (a kind of autorickshaw used all over Bangladesh). Upon arrival at Lakkatura, you can either report to the main office, where you can hire a guide or listen to a lecture about the Lakkatura Tea Garden, or you can wander around the garden by yourself. It is not rare to come across newlyweds having their wedding pictures taken at the picturesque tea garden.",tea landscapes agriculture farms gardens plants
121,Lala Khal,"Lala Khal, Bangladesh",A beautiful stretch of Bangladeshi river known for its high quality sand is possibly more remarkable for its color changing water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lala-khal,"In the northeast corner of Bangladesh, at the border with India, the Himalayas stop. The Himalayas (Sanskrit for “abode of the snow”) dissolve into gentle slopes blanketed in shrubs of tea, and the snow, melted, flows into Bangladesh in the Shari-Goyain River. Just on the Bangladesh side, on the banks of the blue river, is an area called Lala Khal. Lala Khal is about 26 miles from Sylhet, the micropolitan capital of Sylhet Division, Bangladesh’s tea production epicenter. The locals have only recently started calling Sylhet a city; before, it was just a town. From there, the best way to get to Lala Khal is on a public bus. For 60 taka each (78 US cents), a bus destined for Jaflong drops off passengers all along the way, including at Sarighat, the gateway to Lala Khal. On the way, locals point out the growing hills: “India.” At Sarighat, between the highway and the river, stalls sell everything: biscuits, toothpaste, potato chips, and cigarettes. Lighters dangle from strings tied to the ceilings. In the early summer, pyramids of watermelons line the road, and red, juicy slices sit perched atop the piles, beckoning flies and buyers. Below, on the river, men sit smoking among summer fruits piled high in small boats. A few steps away from the bus stop, a concrete staircase descends to the riverbank, where a row of colorful boats, called “nokas” in Bengali, wait for visitors. The boat operators, called “nokawallahs,” flock to tourists and demand prices three times what might be considered fair. For a foreigner, an hour ride on a private boat, all the way to the border, should cost between 800 and 1000 taka (around 10 USD). The nokawallah starts the engine with oil from a water bottle, and the boat cruises past hearts carved into rocks and women doing laundry. Swimming boys splash and wave. After a while, the boat stops at the Lala Khal Tea Estate, where tea grows in winding rows and the laborers and their families live in a self-contained village. On the slope rising from the river, a sign warns against crossing into India. Several feet beyond, the India Border Guard keeps watch. Later in the year, at the height of monsoon season, the river will rise several feet. The riverbanks will become unrecognizable, and the water will turn murky and brown. But in the brutally hot early summer, the water is still cool and crystal blue. Floating there in the South Asian summer, it’s possible to forget fear and worry: on the way back to Sarighat, sitting on top of a noka canopy, the most beautiful setting sun in Bangladesh will dry your wet clothes.",rivers natural wonders water nature
122,Panam Nagar,"Sonargaon, Bangladesh",This historic textile city was abandoned after being ravaged by fire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/panam-nagar,"In its heyday, Panam Nagar was home to a prosperous community of Hindu merchants that turned the medieval Bengali capital into a thriving textile trading hub in the 19th century. It’s no coincidence that the East India Company set up its permanent offices in Panam Nagar (Panam City), which was then the Bengali capital. Yet if textiles brought wealth to the town, they likely contributed to its downfall as well. Uncertainty surrounds the origins of the fire that razed much of the historic city to the ground, but the fact that such a large number of textiles were stored in the buildings here made the area a huge fire hazard. It is also not clear whether the Hindu community abandoned Panam Nagar before or after the rumor that the town was haunted began. What is known is that what’s left of Panam Nagar has been left derelict for decades, and locals have nicknamed it “Ghost City” and “City of the Dead.” Only 52 of the city’s original buildings are still standing. Most are two-story structures, standing one attached to the other along the main thoroughfare. The oldest of these buildings is said to date back to the 15th century, but most are from the 19th century. It is obvious that these were buildings made for affluent residents, judging from the colonial architecture, the thickness of the walls, and their endurance in spite of decades of neglect.  Panam Nagar is in Sonargaon, about 18 miles (30 km) southeast of Dhaka, along the Meghna River. It can be reached by bus from Gulistan Station in Dhaka, but this may take an inordinate amount of time due to traffic and frequent stops. Should you decide to take this option, the bus stop for Panam Nagar is Magrapara Crossing, from which a rickshaw can take you to Panam Nagar. The other option is to take a taxi from Dhaka to Panam Nagar and back. Depending on your negotiating skills, the whole affair can be very affordable. Due to the level of disrepair, it is ill-advised to enter some of the abandoned houses in Panam Nagar.",textiles fires industrial ghost towns abandoned history
123,Cox's Bazar Beach,"Cox's Bazar District, Bangladesh",One of the longest natural sand beaches in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/coxs-bazar-beach,"Stretching a remarkable 75 miles in length, Cox’s Bazar Beach is one of the longest uninterrupted natural sand beaches in all of Bangladesh. Most of Cox’s Bazar is 660 feet wide at high tide, and 1,300 feet wide at low tide. This Bay of Bengal beach is quite unknown to the international beach-loving crowd. But Cox’s Bazar is one of the most visited destinations in Bangladesh. Along its 75 miles, different sections of Cox’s Bazar Beach have distinct names, usually referring to the flora and fauna in the area. Among the most popular sections are Laboni Beach, Humchari Beach, and Inani Beach, all doable on one-day trips from the town of Cox’s Bazar, where most accommodation is located. Further south is Teknaf Beach. In general, the further south you go, the bluer the ocean, and the smaller the crowd. If you stay near Cox’s Bazar town, brace yourself for throngs of people. This can be frustrating if you were expecting a deserted tropical beach, but it can a great opportunity to get closer to the Bangladeshi notion of a beach holiday. Founded in 1869, Cox’s Bazar is named after Captain Hiram Cox, superintendent of the British East India Company, which was stationed in Palongkee (the town’s former name). This is an anomaly in the subcontinent, where most colonial place names have been changed, and it is probably due to the positive effect of Captain Cox’s rehabilitation work with the Arakanese refugees.  The easiest and fastest of getting to Cox’s Bazar is by plane. There are daily flights to Dhaka and Chittagong. For those not afraid of sitting in the traffic for hours, buses are also available. There is not a huge supply of accommodation, but in and near Cox’s Bazar town there are both high-end and budget options, including a handful of eco-lodges. A couple of warnings. This is not Cancun or Pattaya. Local people are extremely friendly, but you have to remember that Bangladesh is a conservative Muslim country. The attire for both men and women should be modest, even while swimming. Once you go beyond Cox’s Bazar town, you will find few (if any) facilities. If venturing south, you should plan on being self-reliant. Be careful with quicksand, especially during low tide.",world's longest beaches natural wonders nature
124,National Assembly of Bangladesh,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",Ancient and modern architecture are joined in Louis Kahn's monument to democracy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-assembly-of-bangladesh,"The masterpiece of American architect Louis Kahn, the National Assembly of Bangladesh (Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban) is both graceful and monumental in its union of modern design with ancient references. Construction started in 1961, but it wasn’t completed until nine years after Kahn’s death in 1983. The project was interrupted by the country’s liberation war from Pakistan, which also transformed Kahn’s vision from an imposing government headquarters to a tribute to the proud new democracy of Bangladesh. It was built with concrete inlaid with white marble, giving it a simplicity that relates to the other buildings in the city and makes it resistant to the extreme Bengali desert climate. Private offices overlook the water and a man-made moat ripples between the main building and the rest of the complex. Kahn’s love of rationalism through geometry is everywhere, from the shapes and lines structuring the exterior to the interior corridors circling the main hall. The rooms glow with natural light let in by the geometric shapes, which also contribute to a natural interior environmental control system. The High Court of Bangladesh recently passed a decision to secure the preservation of Kahn’s original vision from any future alterations.",architectural oddities architecture
125,Star Mosque,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",A tiny mosque decorated with mosaics using an early form of recycling.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/star-mosque,"When the Star Mosque (or Tara Masjid in Bengali) in Dhaka was first built in the first half of the 19th century, the original Mughal design included a large dome in the center and two smaller ones on each side. Through the years, additions were built and the interior was decorated—changes that were met with criticism, as they subverted the architectural sensibilities of the Mughal style. Today, with the old design all but gone, the main appeal of the mosque is the striking mosaics decorating it. The artisans who created these patterns used a technique called Chinitikri, which uses broken shards of China porcelain as mosaic pieces. (Pieces of broken bottles were also used at times because colored ceramics were costly.) The size of the pieces varied from half an inch to 2.5 inches, and the preferred shapes were rhomboid and triangular. The mosque is now one of the few extant examples of an architectural work decorated with Chinitikri-style mosaics. Most notable is the Chinitikri blue star motif that gives the structure its popular name, Star Mosque. Hundreds of blue-colored stars adorn the white marble domes, and this star theme is echoed by the mosaics of flowers and rosettes found on the façade and the interior of the mosque.  As with most places in Dhaka, ask a CNG driver to take you there. The mosque is located in the Armanitola area of Old Dhaka.",recycling mosques mosaics art history architecture
126,Lalbagh Fort,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",The untimely death of a dignitary's daughter led to this fort being abandoned before it was ever finished.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lalbagh-fort,"During the height of the Mughal Empire, in 1677, Prince Muhammad Azam commissioned the construction of Lalbagh Fort, but the project was never completed. Soon after construction began, Prince Muhammad Azam left Dhaka to join his father, Emperor Aurangzeb, in Delhi. He passed the job to complete the fort down to Shaista Khan, who continued to build it until his beloved daughter Pari Bibi died there in 1684. Shaista Khan, believing the fort was cursed, halted construction immediately, and it remains in its unfinished state today. The discontinuation of the project met with no objection from Prince Muhammad Azam who was, at the time, engaged to Pari Bibi. Three main sections of the fort are complete, namely the Mausoleum of Pari Bibi, Diwan-i-Aam (the Hall of Audience), and Quilla Mosque. The Mausoleum of Pari Bibi consists of a white marble room with the tomb in the center. Access to the room is restricted. The Hall of Audience, which used to be the residence of the Mughal governor, is a two-story building that now houses a museum showcasing Mughal items such as coins, paintings, carpets, and weapons. Quilla Mosque is a relatively small mosque with three elegant domes. These three structures are surrounded by manicured gardens, which also contain a bathing tank overgrown with vegetation. An intricate web of underground tunnels was also finished below Lalbagh Fort. In an episode of the Sepoy Revolution, in 1857, it is said that soldiers on both sides ventured into the tunnels and never resurfaced, adding to the mystery and intrigue that envelops the fort. To this day, rumors circulate that Lalbagh Fort is haunted.  Roads around Old Dhaka can be confusing. Narrow alleys and newly built multi-lane roads are equally congested, making navigation challenging. As there is no shortage of rickshaws in the area, this is the best way to reach Lalbagh Fort.",cursed places haunted forts abandoned architecture
127,Curzon Hall,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",The fight to make Bengali an official language started in this stunning university hall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/curzon-hall,"In 1948, when Pakistan and Bangladesh were one country, the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan chose Urdu and English to be its official languages. This event occurred within the walls of this impressive Bangladesh university building and sparked the Bengali Language Movement, which advocated the use of Bengali as an official language. Because the government feared retaliation from the Bengali-speaking population, it banned public meetings and rallies. This didn’t stop students and activists at the University of Dhaka from organizing. In 1952, police killed a number of students demonstrating their support for the movement, which prompted countrywide unrest that subsequently claimed thousands of lives. Bengali was eventually granted the status of official language in 1956. Imbued in the Bengali Language Movement were the seeds of independence, which led to the Bangladesh Liberation War and the establishment of Bangladesh as an independent country in 1971. February 21 is now International Mother Language Day, a national holiday. Now, history and everyday life rub shoulders at Curzon Hall. Though originally built to house a town hall, it’s currently home to the Faculty of Science at the University of Dhaka. As in other universities, throngs of students hurry in and out of the building, while others chat in on its arched balconies. The building was named after Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, who laid its foundations in 1904. Curzon Hall is an exquisite blend of European and Mughal architectural traditions and stands as one of the most beautiful buildings in Dhaka. There is free access to the garden in which Curzon Hall is located.

128,Columbo Sahib’s Tomb,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",Hidden under the thick tropical vegetation of a cemetery is the tomb of Columbo Sahib.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/columbo-sahib-s-tomb,"This tomb consists of a square base surmounted by an octagonal structure. Including the cupola, the structure is about three-stories tall. Inside the square base are three off-center tombs. Although there are no epitaphs, it can be assumed they belonged to members of Columbo Sahib’s immediate family. It’s unclear where Columbo Sahib (aka Colombo Saheb) is buried. The tomb is a composite of different architectural styles. The lower structure resembles a Mughal mosque, with four openings, one on each side. The beautifully elaborate upper section exhibits gothic features, and the upper cupola has a baroque flavor. These different styles blend seamlessly and are further enhanced by the overgrown vegetation that has become an integral part of the structure. Although this interplay produces a romantic sense of decay and slow disintegration, the tomb has become structurally unstable. The beauty of this tomb did not escape Johan Zoffany’s eye. The German artist captured a snapshot of 18th-century Dhaka in the painting “Nagapan Ghat,” where Columbo Sahib’s Tomb is easily recognizable on the banks of a river. Of all the tombs in Dhaka Christian Cemetery, that of Columbo Sahib is by far the largest and most striking. It is therefore all the more puzzling that little is known about Columbo Sahib. Bishop Reginald Heber (1783-1826) attempted to uncover the identity of Columbo Sahib, but only managed to discover that this mysterious person worked for “Company ka nuokur.” Information that Heber never managed to confirm. The first record of Dhaka Christian Cemetery comes from 16th-century documents. It was first established for European traders, soldiers, and administrators in Dhaka. So, it’s not surprising that many tombs belong to prominent members of the East India Company.  Dhaka Christian Cemetery can be easily found along Narinda Road by the banner on its main gate, which is usually locked. A firm knock on the gate will usually attract the attention of the guardian, who will grant visitors access to the burial grounds.",tombs burial places cemeteries history & culture

It’s a piece of India that until very recently was completely surrounded by a piece of Bangladesh, which itself was completely surrounded by India, which was again completely surrounded by Bangladesh. An enclave is a piece of one country’s territory which is entirely surrounded by another country’s territory, and the India-Bangladesh border was filled with them before 2015, when they were eliminated by a treaty between the two countries. A second-order enclave is an enclave inside an enclave, and the world has a handful of them. But in the history of the world there has only been one third-order enclave, an enclave inside of an enclave inside of an enclave. This is Dahala Khagrabari (#51), located in the Cooch Behar district of West Bengal, the border between India and Bangladesh. Just 2 acres in size, nobody ever lived inside this unique enclave, but it was owned by a Bangladeshi jute farmer who every morning, woke up in Bangladesh, walked over to India to farm his land, and returned home to Bangladesh at the end of the day. While some of the world’s most developed countries have at least one enclave and still function normally, the enclave situation of the India-Bangladesh border before 2015 was distinctly different. The border contained a whopping 198 enclaves, with over 50,000 people living in them. Since almost all of these enclaves were made up of farmland (and not cities), it can be inferred that tens of thousands of Indians and Bangladeshis had to regularly cross international borders just to acquire food, supplies and health care. But crossing one border is nothing compared to crossing two or three. If that same Bangladeshi jute farmer was working on the farm one day and wanted to walk to the nearest bus stop a half mile away, he would have to cross from his Indian farm into Bangladeshi territory, then cross back into India, and at last arrive back in another part of Bangladesh to reach the stop. That’s three border crossings in a half mile, just to board the bus in his home country. In an effort to fix this messy result of political border disputes, a July 2015 treaty eliminated all enclaves in India and Bangladesh by simply “erasing” all enclave border lines. Unfortunately, in many ways the border situation is just as chaotic as ever. Imagine living in an Indian enclave in Bangladesh, and suddenly hearing that, because of the treaty, you’re suddenly not living in India anymore, you’re living in Bangladesh. Right now many of the Indians and Bangladeshis who were previously living in enclaves are finding themselves in the wrong country. Update: This is no longer an enclave but part of Bangladesh since the 2015 treaty.",enclaves recursive places territorial dispute border crossings geographic oddities borders

While it is not the largest shipyard in the country (that honor belongs to the Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard), the Dhaka yard in the town of Keraniganj shares the seeming disregard for worker safety that can be found in simialr industrial sites around the country. The facilities, which employ around 15,000 workers at around $5 a day, work to both break down massive shipping vessels as well as create new ships from the parts. Workers can be seen torches and welding equipment to tears huge pieces of metal from the vessels, sans eye, hand, or face protection. Other workers will be found scaling the tall ships on ramshackle ladders or strolling along the high edges of the ship decks, the only thing to keep them from falling is their own balance. Injuries are common on the site, but the buzz of activity doesn’t stop. The ships being worked on are propped up on crude chalks creating the appearance that the river simply receded and left these hulks stranded on dry land. The space is tight so many of the boats are right up to small homes and other structures. This is clearly a worksite that is dangerous to its employees, and even more so to careless visitors.

Unbeknownst to many, there was a thriving Armenian population in Dhaka during the 17th and 18th centuries, and this 200-year-old church is all that’s left of that community. There is no record of when the first Armenians moved to Dhaka, but it was likely in the early 17th century, soon after the Persian Shāh Abbās conquered Armenia and deported 40,000 of its traders to Persia. Following this mass deportation, records of Armenian communities began appearing throughout the region. The move from Persia to Dhaka is not implausible considering that Persian was the official language in the Mughal Empire at the time. The textile business was booming and Armenians traded in jute, leather, and silk. Thanks to this industry, the community grew wealthy and in 1781 it commissioned the construction of a Catholic church, the Armenian Church of the Holy Resurrection. Measuring 75 feet in length, the white and yellow-trimmed church is rather small; the main hall can accommodate about 80 people. A fine painting depicting the Last Supper hangs on the wall, and a wooden spiral stair leads to the upstairs balcony, where another 20 or 30 people can find room. From there, two low, narrow openings give access to the roof. The lot on which the church was built was previously used as a cemetery by the Armenian community, and the churchyard is still an old burial ground where Armenian script is clearly visible on headstones. On one of the oldest graves is a skull and crossbones carving, indicating that the person was killed by pirates, in 1783. Service is no longer held on a regular basis, but on special occasions, such as Easter, a group of Catholic expats organizes a service in the historic church.  The gates to the Armenian church are usually closed, but knock or wait around a while, and someone will open them.

Hundreds of meters long, ferrying millions of tons of goods across the globe, the sheer size of these immense vessels is awe inspiring. Construction of one such behemoth is a fascinating feat of engineering. However, the destruction and final resting place of these steel giants is even more intriguing. Even when such a ship is not seaworthy anymore, and repairs are not economically viable, the raw material it is constructed from has some value. Nowadays ship-breaking yards tend to be located in third world countries, places far out of sight of the consumers whose supermarkets they helped supply, and where labor is cheap and environmental protection laws are lax. There ships are chipped down bit by bit, usually by hand, and stripped of every last bit of value. Fauzdarhat, 20 kilometers northwest of Chittagong in Bangladesh, is where many of the world’s ships go to die. Over twenty ship-breaking yards dot the 16 miles of coastline. It is an industrial wasteland of epic proportions, where thousands of workers are forced to scratch their meager existence out of these hulking steel ruins, working with rudimentary protection, risking injury and illness, poisoned by toxic fumes and exposure to asbestos and other hazardous materials. Chittagong is but one of many such places. Gadani in Pakistan is perhaps even larger. Alang in Gujarat in India is another. Environmental groups such as Greenpeace have tried to raise awareness of the threat that these ship-breaking yards pose to both the people employed in them and to the environment.

133,Paro Taktsang,"Paro, Bhutan",The small cliffside monastery known as the Tiger's Nest is said to be the meditation site of an eighth-century Buddhist master.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paro-taktsang-tigers-nest-monastery,"This temple complex hangs far up on a cliff overlooking the Paro valley in Bhutan. It is one of 13 small monasteries, or “tiger lairs” where the Buddhist master Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rinpoche, is said to have meditated in the 8th century. Padmasambava, which translates as “he who came into being in a lotus,” was a Brahmin royal who spread Tantric Buddhism through Bhutan and Tibet in the 700s, and is seen in those areas as nearly as holy as the Buddha himself. As legend has it, Padmasambava landed at Paro Taktsang to meditate when he brought Buddhism to Bhutan in the 8th century. He is said to have arrived on a flying tiger which had recently been his Tibetan concubine. He then meditated in a cave high on the mountain for four months after which he subdued the local ‘demons’ and began the conversion of the Bhutanese to Buddhism. For those without flying tiger concubines, getting to the Tiger’s Nest is significantly more difficult. There is a two hour climb from the valley floor, which is already quite high at 7,000 feet, to the Tiger’s Nest 3,000 feet above— 10,000 feet above sea level. As one climbs the well-maintained but very steep trail over ever more vertical switchbacks, the monastery seems to appear and disappear in and out of the trees and the mists. After two hours of a long slow climb—going slow is recommended to help manage the pace of the altitude—one arrives at the only beginning of the entrance to the Tiger’s Nest, a rock outcropping overlooking a vast chasm, with the monastery on the other side. Beneath the promontory of rock, and across the chasm from the monastery, the cliff drops a couple of thousand feet to the gorge below. Carved into the exposed cliff face are stone steps; handrails have only recently been added. This is the way to the Tiger’s Nest monastery. Despite reservations that visitors may have about navigating the intimidating steps, it’s common to see Bhutanese locals, including mothers carrying small babies, walking up the steps with ease. The steps lead down into the gorge, which provides the separation and isolation the Tiger’s Nest has enjoyed for all these centuries. As one climbs into the canyon, a 100-meter high waterfall at the deep end of the canyon appears immediately in front, with the path traversing directly across its base.

134,Dochula Pass Meditation Caves,"Dochula, Bhutan",The small sanctuaries lie just off the beaten path near one of Bhutan's most famous attractions.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dochula-pass-meditation-caves,"Dochula Pass is one of Bhutan’s most famous sites, perched at an altitude of 10,200 feet and located along the road from the country’s current capital of Thimphu to its former capital Punakha. A hidden surprise awaits the few who take the time to venture away from the touristy hub. These curious visitors will discover the meditation caves tucked into the hills just above the pass. At first resembling Hobbit homes, these tiny, open-faced caverns are built from stone and painted in colorful detail with Buddhist symbolism. The druk, or dragon—Bhutan’s long-time national symbol and spirit animal—stretches over the cave entrance, bringing good luck and good tidings. Meditation is a critical exercise for serious practitioners of Buddhism. To achieve enlightenment, monks and nuns will stay in one location, such as a meditation cave, for three days, three months, and three years. Each period is a trial for the next—if one can manage three days, one proceeds to three months. During this time, one may not speak with or cast eyes on another person. If you make it through three months, it’s time to take on three years. While you may not have three years to spare while visiting these caves, you’d be missing a hidden gem of Dochula Pass if you didn’t take the extra 10-minute climb into the forest to explore these carefully constructed meditative retreats that nearly blend into the hills. The short trek to the caves is a respite from the famous pass, which is home to 108 memorial chortens, or stupas, built in 2004 in honor of fallen Bhutanese soldiers killed in the battle against insurgents from India’s Assam region in 2003. Most visitors come to the pass for the magnificent views. On a clear day (which you’re lucky if you catch), you can take in Himalayan peaks including Mount Masanggang and Mount Gangkar Puensum, both over 22,000 feet tall. There is a cafe just up the hill from the chortens. Head this way and continue upwards, following paths built from oval-shaped stone steps. As long as you continue following any of these paths, you'll soon encounter the meditation caves. If you continue farther, you'll discover an area strung with hundreds of worn prayer flags, and then a gate locked and decorated with barbed wire. Suffice it to say, time to turn back if you've made it this far.",meditation buddhism caves religion ecosystems sacred spaces

The hoofed beasts, which look like a mishmash of cows and goats, are held in extremely high esteem. The takin is a rare type of goat-antelope living in the Eastern Himalayas. The four subspecies of the takin live in high altitudes throughout Bhutan, Northeast India, Northwest Myanmar, and the Chinese section of the Himalaya. The odd-looking animals are the national animal of Bhutan. According to local legend, a 15th-century saint concocted the curious creature after he agreed to conjure up a miracle in exchange for lunch. He then slapped the head of a goat atop a cow’s skeleton and brought this new animal to life. In reality, the takin is the result of convergent evolution. The animals’ protracted noses, large heads, and sturdy torsos give them a distinctive look. Taxonomists, biologists, and zoologists are all keen to study the creature because though it resembles a muskox, it’s actually more genetically similar to sheep. The takin found at the Motithang Takin Preserve were once part of a small zoo. But when the King of Bhutan declared it was improper for Buddhist country to keep animals in such confinement, the big beasts were set free. Yet they didn’t wander far. The freed takin, which at this point were used to humans, preferred to converge within Thimphu. The Motithang Takin Preserve was created to provide shelter to the capital city’s four-legged residents. Now, the takin live within 8.4 acres of carefully managed forest. The Bhutanese authorities are particularly attentive to the health and wellbeing of the takin due to its status as the national animal. Other takin roam in the Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve in India. Surprisingly, you can also spot an actively breeding herd in Cumberland, Ohio, which was planted there as part of a Species Survival Plan.",evolution wildlife sanctuaries legends animals
136,Buddha Dordenma Statue,"Thimphu, Bhutan","This giant Buddha statue has 125,000 smaller Buddhas hidden inside it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buddha-dordenma,"Atop a hill in Thimphu, the capital and largest city of Bhutan, is a massive, golden Buddha sitting atop a gilded meditation hall. But the monument holds an invisible secret: Unbeknownst to many people viewing the statue, they aren’t actually looking at one Buddha, they’re looking at 125,000 of them. Inside of Thimphu’s 169 foot Buddha Dordenma statue, there are 125,000 miniature Buddhas encapsulated inside of its enlightened bronze chest, ranging from 8 to 12 inches tall. This means that in Thimphu, which has a population of around 100,000, there are more Buddhas than there are human beings. Like the large Buddha, these thousands of miniature Buddhas are also gilded and made of bronze, a major reason that the statue cost almost $100 million to build when it was constructed in 2015 to honor the 60th birthday of Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the fourth king of Bhutan. The statue also fulfils two prophecies. The first, foreseen by yogi Sonam Sangpo, is that a Buddhist statue would be built in the region to “bestow blessings, peace, and happiness to the whole world.” In addition, the statue is said to have been mentioned by Guru Padmasambhava, widely referred to as the “second Buddha,” in the eighth century.

Phalluses are not an uncommon sight in Bhutan. The symbol is meant to bring good luck, promote fertility and harmony, and ward off evil spirits. They’re painted in and on buildings, displayed on the headgear of Atsaras (masked clowns), and even used as scarecrows. A traditional housewarming ritual involves hoisting a basket of wooden phalluses onto the roof on the new home. The symbols date back to the 15th century, when the eccentric Buddhist teacher Drukpa Kunley, known as the “Divine Madman,” popularized the symbol when he brought Buddhism to Bhutan (showcased by his “penis-focused monastery,” Chimi Lhakhang). The Garden of Phallus is found in Simply Bhutan, a museum, restaurant, and photography studio built to resemble a Bhutanese village. Larger-than-life phallus statues mingle with plants in front of a mural which features several hanging smiling faces whose noses look an awful lot like, well, we’ll let you guess what they look like.

138,Punakha Suspension Bridge,"Punakha, Bhutan",This colorful overpass is one of Bhutan's longest suspension bridges.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/punakha-suspension-bridge,"The high mountains and deep gorges of Bhutan lend themselves to suspension bridges. Punakha Suspension Bridge, which is always adorned with colorful prayer flags, is the perfect example of this. Linking Punakha Dzong to Shengana, Samdingkha, and Wangkha villages across the Tsang Chu River (aka Po Chu), this is one of the longest suspension bridges in Bhutan. Yet, for a roughly 520-foot-long suspension bridge, it’s surprisingly stable. The bridge offers a spectacular view of the river and valley, and the east bank is a good starting point for multi-day treks in the nearby mountains. Traditional Bhutanese bridges make use of cantilevers, beams anchored to one bank and projecting horizontally to reach the other bank. This simple but effective structure can be upgraded by using interlocking beams. A prime example of this is the bridge in front of Punakha Dzong. Unlike these bridges, the one in Punakha relies on cables anchored to massive cement blocks on the banks. Being suspended, the bridge does have some inbuilt flexibility that makes it swing in strong winds, but not as much as you may expect. This is due to the stabilizing cables that taper off on both ends of the bridge. The deck is made of solid planks of wood nested in the deck truss.  Punakha Bridge is only about half a mile from Punakha Dzong, but it can easily be missed, as it’s not on the main road. To find it, head north from the dzong past the cremation grounds, following the Puna Tsang Chu River, either via rural roads on the west bank or via Trashigang-Semtokha Highway.",engineering infrastructure bridges

The structure is strategically located on a steep slope commanding an extraordinary view of the Mangde River, approximately in the middle of the Kingdom of Bhutan. Narrow stone stairs, alleys, and corridors connect the buildings at all levels of the fortress, creating a veritable labyrinth on the slope. Within the walls of the dzong are 25 temples dedicated to Tantric deities, a watchtower (Ta Dzong) dating back to 1652, a printing shop producing religious texts following an ancient tradition, and a museum honoring the Wangchuck dynasty. In addition to its military importance, Trongsa Dzong was a major administrative and religious centre, still housing around 200 monks during the winter months. The historic fortress was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1897, and eventually restored in 1927 and 1999. It now annually hosts Trongsa Tsechu, a 5-day religious festival where traditional costumes and masks are deployed for the dances.

140,Chimi Lhakhang,"Punakha, Bhutan","This penis-focused monastery is dedicated to Buddhism's ""Divine Madman.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chimi-lhakhang,"In general Buddhism is associated with serenity, peace, and beauty, and Bhutan’s Chimi Lhakhang monastery is no different, it just has a lot more penises. Also known as the “Fertility Temple,” the single building site was originally built in 1499 on a short hill that had been blessed by rogue Buddhist leader Drukpa Kunley, known as the “Divine Madman.” Drupa Kunley, also known as “The Saint of 5,000 Women” worked overtime to spread enlightenment through an active sex life. He was known to live a truly bacchanal lifestyle full of wine, women, and poetry. He is also credited with bringing Buddhism to Bhutan, hence the common phallic imagery found throughout the country. The phallus became Drupa Kunley’s symbol, signaling both fertility and the power to bring enlightenment to those who… learned from its teachings. Because of this, his penis as a symbol is sometimes known as the “Thunderbolt of Flaming Wisdom.” Drupa Kunley’s mad antics were a statement on the stuffiness of the Buddhist leaders at the time, but his exploits seemed to strike a chord with the locals, and illustrations of penises became a more common sight, said to be able to ward off evil spirits. This came from the legends that Drupa Kunley could bop demons on the head with his thunderbolt and turn them into protective spirits. In modern Bhutan, use of the penis as a symbol is frowned upon, as it might be any place in the world where wearing pants is the norm. But at Chimi Lhakang, the penises still adorn the walls of the nearby buildings, and wooden phalluses are still kept by the monks, used to bless women that seek to be blessed with children. Visitors from all over the world still travel to the monastery for a blessing of fertility.",buddhism temples
141,The Burning Lake,Bhutan,Legend has it a sacred treasure hidden by an ancient guru was revealed with a burning butter lamp from these waters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-burning-lake,"Though it’s known as Mebar Tsho, or “the Burning Lake,” this sacred site is not quite a lake at all, but rather a pool along a river in the Tang Valley. Local legend says that the water contained a hidden holy treasure uncovered through divination by one of Bhutan’s most important religious figures, Terton Pema Lingpa, in the late 1400s. Terton Pema Lingpa is thought to have been the reincarnation of Padmasambhava, an ancient guru also known as the Second Buddha. According to religious tradition, in the 8th century Padmasambhava hid secret teachings containing Buddhist wisdom for terton, treasure revealers like Pema Lingpa, to unearth in the future so his principles could live on. In the 15th century, Pema Lingpa had a vision that treasure was hidden in a pool where the Tang Chhu River widens. When the locals questioned the validity of his prediction, he submerged himself in the water holding a lit butter lamp, and resurfaced with a chest and a scroll, the lamp still aflame. Until that point, the pool had been referred to as Nya Ring Brag, translating to “Long-Nosed Cliff” for the cliff faces that surround the area. But from then on, this body of water assumed the name Mebar Tsho, or the Burning Lake. A conflicting hypothesis presents the slightly different narrative that the name Mebar Tscho actually references another treasure revealer by the name of Terton Sherab Mebar, who is also said to have uncovered treasure teachings from the lake. Still, the Burning Lake remains one of the region’s most sacred places and a pilgrimage site for many Bhutanese people. Colorful prayer flags fly around an altar dedicated to Terton Pema Lingpa, and butter lamps can be found scattered on the riverbanks as tribute.  The Burning Lake is a 30-minute drive from Chamkhar Town, located along the road to Ura or the Tang village in central Bhutan's Tang Valley. It takes about five minutes to walk from the road to the lake.

142,Gangteng Gompa,Bhutan,This 17th-century Bhutanese monastery is ensconced in Buddhist legend.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gangteng-gompa,"Gangteng Gompa is a historic monastery in the Black Mountain region of Bhutan. Built in the early 17th century, the monastery was established by Gyalse Rigdzin Pema Thinley, the grandson of the canonized Bhutanese “treasure revealer,” Pema Lingpa. Today, Gangteng Gompa is the largest Nyingmapa monastery in Western Bhutan. Buddhist mythology recalls the narrative of an ancient guru who hid terma (sacred treasures of Buddhist wisdom) for select terton (treasure finders) to reveal in the future when the time was right. The terma were hidden for their protection so that the terton could transmit Buddha’s teachings through the generations should his knowledge ever be lost or destroyed. Pema Lingpa, the grandfather of the monastery’s founder, was understood as an incarnation of that ancient guru. Following a series of revelations, he astoundingly unearthed over 100 terma across Bhutan in the mid-1470s. Rendered “King Terton,” Pema Lingpa made a pilgrimage to the imposing Black Mountain range, where he envisaged one of his descendants would build a monastery. Gangteng Gompa was established in 1613 by Pema Lingpa’s grandson on a spur in the Black Mountains called the Gangteng Sang Nga Chöling, which translates to “summit for the teaching of the dharma.” Local timber was used for the temple’s beams, doors, pillars, and windows. Delep, a guardian deity, supposedly created a landslide in the mountains for better access to stones. A team of community artisans embellished the space with exquisite technicolor detail. The monastery was restored between 2002 and 2008. Conservators worked to preserve the temple’s original detail with the addition of over 100 new pillars. Upon the temple’s completion, it was re-presented as Gangteng Sangngak Chöling, and consecrated by the ninth Gangteng Trulku, who is considered the current incarnation of Pema Lingpa.  On November 12 of each year, Gangteng Gompa hosts a Crane Festival to mark the annual arrival of black-necked cranes from the Tibetan plateau. Hundreds of cranes, which are sacred in the region, return to the monastery to roost, thought to bless the space by circling it three times.",buddhism monasteries
143,Kyichu Lhakhang Temple,Bhutan,One of Bhutan's oldest temples was purportedly built to halt a giant female ogre from preventing the spread of Buddhism across Tibet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyichu-lhakhang-temple,"Kyichu Lhakhang (also called Lho Kyerchu and Kyerchu) is a majestic seventh-century temple revered as one of the most magnificent sites of worship in Bhutan. Located in the town of Paro, some sources reference the temple as one of the oldest in the nation; others name it the oldest. The original temple is said to have been built overnight on the left foot of a colossal ogress—otherwise referred to as a demoness—who intercepted the spread of Buddhism as she lay across the land. It’s thought to be one of over 100 temples established to overpower her so Buddhism could flourish far and wide. Kyichu Lhakhang is believed to have been a smaller structure when the Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo erected this sacred building in the year 659, but a number of Buddhist saints and gurus added to the site until it became the spectacular temple it is today. Legend has it that the Second Buddha, Padmasambhava, was one of the important historical figures who paid pilgrimage to Kyichu Lhakhang in the eighth century, and that he hid treasure teachings around the temple. The building underwent a round of renovations in the 1830s, and in 1968, the Royal Queen Mother Ashi Kezang Choden Wangchuck ordered its expansion in the way of Guru Lhakhang: a neighboring chapel that houses statues of Padmasambhava and Kurukulla, a female lotus deity, clutching a bow and an arrow made of flowers. Beyond the exquisite gilded door to the main temple of Jowo Lhakhang is an original statue of Jowo Jamba (also Jowo Shakyamuni or Jowo Rinpoche) forged in the seventh century. His likeness constitutes the most sacred sculpture in the region, and the wooden planks on the floor in front of him manifest the wear and tear of centuries of worship at his feet. Nearby, a statue of Chenrezig, an all-knowing deity said to embody the compassion of all the Buddhas, bears 11 heads and 1,000 arms. The cloisters that fortify the temple foster a contemplative space populated by fruit trees and prayer wheels, which monks spin quietly as they circulate the space. The inner courtyard conceals a mural portraying King Gesar of Ling, a warrior who is said to have conjured the longest poem in history.  Kyichu Lhakhang is a 10-minute drive from Paro proper.

144,Drukgyel Dzong,"Paro, Bhutan",The ruins of an abandoned 17th-century fort that was almost completely destroyed by a fire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drukgyel-dzong,"For much of human history, the land that makes up modern Bhutan was recognized as the territory of Tibet. It was not until the early-to-mid-17th century, when Bhutan and Tibet went to war and Drukgyel Dzong was built, that things began to change. In 1634, a Tibetan refugee by the name of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal rose to power in Bhutan and led an army to victory over Tibet in the Battle of Five Lamas. Through this war the Bhutanese state was effectively born, and Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal became its first ruler. The fighting did not stop there, however, as waves of Tibetan or Mongol-Tibetan invasions continued in the following decades, trying to regain control of the Bhutanese land. It was during these tumultuous times that the dzong (fortresses) were being strategically placed along the main routes linking Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, to the villages of Bhutan. Drukgyel Dzong was built in 1649 near Paro, in Bhutan, to repel the Tibetan invasions. The name Drukgyel refers to “Druk,” the royal dynasty at the time and the name of the country in its local vernacular, and “gyel,” meaning “victory” or “victorious.” When the invasions finally ended, Drukgyel Dzong became an important stop for traders. Rice was the main export to Tibet, and salt and tea were the main goods imported from Tibet, and caravans would stop by Drukgyel Dzong before tackling the Tremo La pass. The Drukgyel Dzong structure consists of a tall central building and an adjacent courtyard surrounded by lower buildings. The fort takes full advantage of the terrain. It’s located on top of a hill with steep cliffs on three sides, leaving only one side of the structure vulnerable to attack. A fortified wall with several derelict watchtowers surrounds it. There used to be tunnels connecting the dzong with the river to decrease the risk of fetching water during battle, but these tunnels are now sealed. In 1951, Drukgyel Dzong was almost completely destroyed by a fire, and what remained was left to the elements until restoration work began in 2016.  It's located on the upper the Paro Valley, about 8.7 miles from Paro, and is easily accessible by car.",forts politics abandoned

It was built with a specific function in mind: to ward off evil spirits in Bhutan and across the world, and to bring peace and harmony to all living things. Despite its relatively recent construction, Khamsum Yulley Namgyal was built in strict accordance with traditional teachings. It took Bhutanese carpenters, painters and sculptors nine years to build the four-story, pagoda-style stupa, as well as the various smaller pagodas surrounding it, some of which contain prayer wheels. Khamsum Yulley Namgyal was built with a very specific intention in mind. Rather than being a place of communal worship, a monastic retreat or a place of education, it was built to provide spiritual protection, peace and harmony. As such, the chorten is largely focused on wrathful deities, a concept that may seem counterintuitive. As you walk in to the main room on the first floor of Khamsum Yulley Namgyal, for example, you’ll come face to face with a 15-feet-tall statue of Vajrakilaya, one of the eight deities of Kagyé. And while considered a powerful and wrathful deity, Vajrakilaya’s fury is directed at destroying forces hostile to compassion, purifying their power to do damage. Statues and shrines to these wrathful deities are also found on the second and third floors, each offering protection against the forces of evil in the world. And to balance the wrathful force of these deities are a series of yab-yum figures on the walls. Each of these figures depicts a male deity in union with his female consort, representing the union of wisdom and compassion. Finally, as you reach the final rooftop floor, you’ll see a golden statue of Sakyamuni Buddha in his classic pose. The serene statue looks to the south, surveying the spectacular view out across the Punakha Valley.  Khamsum Yulley Namgyal is located in the Punakha District of Bhutan, about 17 miles northeast (as the crow flies) of Thimphu, the largest city and capital of Bhutan. From the town of Punakha, it’s about a one-hour hike along a trail that crosses a suspension bridge and then goes up the hill to the chorten. Khamsum Yulley Namgyal is open to visitors every day of the year, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.",

147,Ogyen Choling Palace and Museum,"Tang Valley, Bhutan",This Bhutanese site is one of eight sacred locales established by a revered 14th-century Buddhist master.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ogyen-choling-palace-and-museum,"Crowned by a 19th-century manor house, Ogyen Choling is the former residence of a ruling family descended from a 14th-century Buddhist teacher. The building, which has since been converted into a museum to promote its conservation and to drive tourism to the village, was largely destroyed following an earthquake in the late 1800s. The residential quarters, the main temple, and the tower were all rebuilt, and the site continues to beckon visitors and religious pilgrims alike. The origins of Ogyen Choling began with a visit to the remote Tang Valley by the illustrious philosopher of ancient Nyingmapa Buddhism, Longchen Rabjam (1308-1363), some seven centuries ago. He allegedly chose the site for the elephant’s head-shaped vista created by the Tang valley and the neighboring Kanyai mountain. In Buddhist mythology, the elephant symbolizes longevity. According to legend, a cave located towards the top of the elephant’s head served as Longchen Rabjam’s place of meditation, and so Ogyen Choling assumed sacred connotations. The site would subsequently attract a legendary terton (a Buddhist treasure seeker endowed with the ability to reveal Buddhist revelations in the way of ancient texts or religious objects that manifest when the need arises) by the name of Dorji Lingpa (1346-1405), who was also an esteemed master of the Nyingmapa school of Buddhism. Throughout the years, Ogyen Choling maintained a strong connection to Dorji Lingpa’s presence there—notably through Tsokye Dorji, the 15th descendant of Dorji Lingpa, who built the palace where Dorji Lingpa’s monastery was in the mid-19th century. According to Kuensel Online, the community surrounding Ogyen Choling was once expected to contribute to the palace’s upkeep by the law of former Bhutanese social order, but come the 1950s when serfdom dissolved, the family had to maintain the rapidly crumbling palace on their own. In an effort to save it and generate revenue for the surrounding village, the house was converted into Bhutan’s first private museum in 2001, which is now completely owned and overseen by the Ogyen Choling Foundation. The palace remains a sacred point of interest for Tibetan Buddhists, but under the Ogyen Choling Foundation’s care, the building also provides a fascinating insight into historical Bhutanese life. Parts of the house have been recreated to give visitors a clear sense of how they would have looked over the last 200 years, and artworks and artifacts have been conserved for their exhibition. While the innermost rooms are lit with electricity, the Foundation’s aim is to present the building as accurately as possible. The main temple was reconstructed from 1898 to 1899 after a destructive earthquake disrupted the grounds in 1897. On-site shrines honor sacred Buddhist figures including Dorji Lingpa, who founded the Ogyen Choling line, and Mahakala, a deity enlisted to protect the village. Note that the Mahakala shrine is reserved exclusively for locals, and visitors are strictly prohibited from entering. That said, some 20 exhibitions illuminating Bhutanese art and traditional craft, a way of life, ritual performances, and more are sure to keep tourists busy.  Visitors are advised to tour the museum between 9 am and 2 pm when the natural light is at its brightest. In 2016, the Ogyen Choling Heritage House opened as a guest house component for overnight stays. The Heritage House offers 14 guest rooms across three buildings, each individually designed to stay true to the aesthetic origins of the site.

Unusually for Bhutan, this chorten—a shrine to an important Buddhist monk—is styled after Bouddhanath Stupa in Nepal, including the signature eyes looking at the four cardinal points. Fitting with the tradition, there is a relic inside the chorten. In this case, it is the skull of Tenzin Lekpai Dhundrup, a powerful figure believed to be the reincarnated guardian of Tibetan Buddhist teachings. Next to the chorten is a long prayer wall adorned with holy Buddhist scriptures. Chendebji Chorten attracts a large number of pilgrims during Sambha Lhundrup Molam Chenmo, a festival held during the ninth month of the Bhutanese calendar, during which devout Buddhists make their wish prayers. Several legends surround Chendebji Chorten. One of these is that the chorten was laid on top of an evil spirit in the form of a giant snake, which was squashed and defeated. Another legend maintains the monument was placed in the exact spot where the three edges of the sky meet. Yet another claims the chorten was built to subdue a demoness that used to torment the area.

Supposedly one of a series of temples built to tame a demoness, today it hosts the Jambay Lhakhang Drup festival, during which the sacred Tercham, or Naked Dance, takes place. In 659 AD, the Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo had a serious problem in his realm. A supine demoness lay across the Himalayas, causing the region to pour forth savagery and malign forces. The king’s attempts to introduce Buddhism to the country were sure to fail should this demoness remain, and the very prospect of civilization in Tibet was under threat. To combat this evil, Songtsen Gampo built a series of temples throughout the Himalayas, each one helping to pin down the demoness. Four were built to pin down her shoulders and hips; four more on the elbows and knees; and four to hold down her hands and feet. Later histories expand this already colorful legend even further, telling of how the king built 108 temples to defeat the demoness, all of which were built in a single day. According to these legends, the temple of Jambay Lhakhang in the Bumthang District of Bhutan was built to pin down the left knee of the demoness. And with Jambay Lhakhang and the other temples in place, the demoness was pinned to the earth forever, allowing the king to rid the land of evil and introduce Buddhism to Tibet. Of the 108 temples supposedly built to defeat the demoness, only a handful remain. These include Jambay Lhakhang, one of the oldest and most sacred temples in the Kingdom of Bhutan. Today, the one-story temple complex, which sits on a plateau by the Bumthang Chhu River, is just as famous for its fanciful history as it is for its annual festival. The Jambay Lhakhang Drup festival is held each year to commemorate the building of the temple and to honor Guru Rimpoche (Padmasambhava), an 8th-century Buddhist master who consecrated the Jambay Lhakhang temple. The four-day festival features many different dances, but two are considered particularly sacred. The first is the Mewang, or Fire Dance, which is held in the evening to bless infertile women in the hope that they may later bear children. The second is the Tercham, or Naked Dance, during which sixteen men dance around the temple, all completely naked, on the stroke of midnight. Why? Well, it apparently dates back to the 8th century, when a band of devils was causing havoc in the area. To distract the devils, the local men performed a naked dance, their unclothed antics leaving the devils spellbound and rendering them harmless. Far less messy than an exorcism.  Jambay Lhakhang is located in Bumthang (also known as Jakar) in the central-eastern region of Bhutan, about 68 miles east of the capital Thimphu. You can visit the temple any time of the year. The Jambay Lhakhang Drup festival takes place every year, but the date varies. In 2018 it began on October 24, and is set to start on November 13 in 2019. And no, you’re not allowed to take photos of the naked dancers.",
150,Gangkhar Puensum,"Gangkhar Puensum, Bhutan",The tallest unclimbed mountain in the world remains poorly charted out of respect for local spirits.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gangkhar-puensum,"While the distinction is a contentious one for a number of reasons (what is the “top” of a mountain, what constitutes a mountain), the honor of world’s highest unclimbed peak is generally agreed to belong to Bhutan’s Gangkhar Puensum, where climbing is actually prohibited. In the Syfy original film, Killer Mountain, Gangkhar Puensum and its mysterious peak hide a murderous alien presence, which, while fantastical, is not far from the actual reason the mountain remains unexplored. Ever since 1994, Bhutan has expressly prohibited climbing on the mountain due not only to the lack of available rescue services in the area, but mainly because of a local custom which held the peaks sacred as they were the homes of holy spirits. At almost 10,000 feet tall from base to summit, Gangkhar Puensum is the highest mountain in Bhutan where the bulk of the prominence rests. However some of the mountain extends into Chinese territory which led to the only attempted climb to the summit. In 1998, a Japanese climbing team set out to explore the uncharted mountain from the Chinese side, but were stopped by political outrage from Bhutan. To this day, Gangkhar Puensum has yet to be successfully mounted and remains one of the precious unexplored areas in an increasingly filled in map of the world. Its a great reminder that there are still countless places of mystery in the world.",exploration mountains
151,Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan,"Thimphu, Bhutan",The nation’s first institution dedicated to the conservation of Bhutanese textiles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/royal-textile-academy-of-bhutan,"The Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan is one of the nation’s first institutions dedicated to the conservation and exhibition of textiles, and the various international techniques used to create them. Weaving is a fundamental component of Bhutanese culture, thus the Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan was established at the behest of Her Majesty Gyalyum (Queen Mother) Sangay Choden Wangchuck as a nonprofit institution in 2005. The academy serves as an educational space by which trainees learn weaving traditions and techniques, how to dye their yarn, and basic business practices such as bookkeeping. It’s also a conservation center used to restore precious artifacts from monasteries all over Bhutan, and a museum that hosts a rotating program of exhibitions relating to the textile arts. Since its inception, the Royal Textile Academy has since expanded to include offices and partnered with the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage to further the organization’s mission to preserve this vital element of Bhutanese art and history.  The Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan is open from 9am-4pm, Monday through Saturday.",bhutan textiles
152,Kampong Ayer,"Kampung Lupak Luas, Brunei","Ferdinand Magellan dubbed the world's largest water village the ""Venice of the East.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kampong-ayer-bandar-seri-begawan-brunei,"For 1,300 years, people have inhabited the stilted water village of Kampong Ayer. Since that time, it has been dubbed the “Venice of the East,” but in many ways, its bizarre water structures are in a league of their own. Today, Kampong Ayer is not only still standing, it is blossoming. More than 30,000 people live in the city, bringing the total population to 10 percent of the entire country of Brunei. Although it’s classified as one village, it’s actually a cluster of 42 smaller villages, interconnected by 18 miles of footbridges. The buildings sit atop stilts on the water’s surface, and the village has electricity and even air conditioning. Kampong Ayer connects Brunei to its past, as people in the area have been living on and off the water throughout its history. According to many accounts, Magellan visited the village in the 16th century, and is credited with coining the phrase “Venice of the East.” Even though many of the structures seem small, the village is also equipped with hospitals, schools, shops, and restaurants.  Wooden speedboat water taxis ferry passengers between distant points across the village. The water taxis often depart in front of the Yayasan Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah in Bandar Seri Begawan.",eccentric homes homes architectural oddities architecture
153,Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei",A symbol of Islam in oil-rich Brunei.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sultan-omar-ali-saifuddin-mosque,"Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque is a an exclamation point above the Brunei River, and the so-called village in the water, Kampong Ayer. Built on an artificial lagoon on the banks of the river, the mosque initially seems more attraction than place of worship. However, this could not be farthest from the truth, and the grandiose mosque was in fact designed solely for prayer to Allah. From around Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei, the golden topped dome of the mosque shines in the night sky. Although its population is only 400,000, 2/3 of the population of Brunei adhere to Islam, laws are based on Sharia. The country is extremely proud of its Muslim population, and the golden mosque was built to honor this section of the country. At a cost of around 5 million USD, the Bruneian Sultan spared no expense: imported Italian marble pillars and floor, granite from Shanghai, crystal chandeliers from England, ornate carpets from Saudi Arabia and a main dome of pure gold. Although the flashy exterior of the mosque and the ceremonial boat in its personal lagoon appear almost gimmicky in their seeming desire to draw in tourists, the mosque’s true purpose becomes clear when visitors realize they cannot enter the mosque, except in prayer. Despite the bar to entry for non-Muslims, the mosque is still one of the most beautiful structures in the country and declared by most to be the most beautiful and fantastic mosque in Southeast Asia.",outsider architecture sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
154,Sumbiling Eco Village,"Batang Duri, Brunei",A remote lodge nestled among some of the world's best-preserved rainforests.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sumbiling-eco-village,"Making up only 1 percent of the island of Borneo and with less than 500,000 residents, Brunei is often overshadowed by its much larger island neighbors, Malaysia and Indonesia. Ignoring tiny Brunei comes at a cost, however, as the slim nation contains some of the world’s oldest rainforests. The rainforests of Brunei have been largely preserved thanks to a strict “no cut” policy the government implemented in the 1990s to combat deforestation. As a result, ancient tropical rainforests span more than 70 percent of Brunei’s terrain, and ecotourism has become a new focus for the nation as it attempts to diversify its extremely oil-dependent economy. Just minutes from Ulu Temburong National Park—the country’s first national park, regularly referred to as the “Green Jewel of Brunei”—the Sumbiling Eco Village capitalizes on these long-term preservation efforts and has become one of the country’s premier eco-destinations. Sumbiling is managed in conjunction with the local Iban community, located on the banks of the Sungai Temburong River. It allows visitors a chance to explore the lush, green jungles that have come to define life in this wildly untouched slice of Borneo.  Sumbling Eco Village is located in Brunei's Temburong District, an exclave separated by Malaysia and Brunei Bay. As a result, the best way to reach the district (and avoid four overland immigration checkpoints) is by taking the speed boat from Bandar Seri Begawan and Bangar, which makes the run regularly from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. One way fares are $6 and the journey takes 45 minutes.",rainforest resorts ecology preservation national parks places to stay nature
155,Istana Nurul Iman,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei",1800 rooms of single-family residence in Brunei.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/istana-nurul-iman,"Named the Palace of the Faith Light, this $1.4 billion home in Brunei seems to display more opulence than spirituality. Completed in 1984, the extravagant Istana Nurul Iman is the largest palace in the world, and is occupied by only one family. Dripping in oil wealth, the palace was commissioned by the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, and every detail of the place is grandiose and over-the-top. Covering 2,000,000 square feet, the palace features everything one would expect; 1,800 rooms, a 110 car garage, and of course, an air-conditioned stable for the Sultan’s horses. So as not to get too far from the idea of Faith Light, the palace also includes its own mosque that can accommodate 1,500 worshippers. Besides being the sultan’s home, he also entertains foreign dignitaries at the palace, and several government offices are also on site. Despite these practical uses, the palace is still very much a home for the sultan and houses part of his 5,000 car collection including custom made Bentleys and hundreds of Ferraris and Rolls Royces. Although it is a private residence, the sultan invites the masses in for three days a year during Hari Raya Aidilfitri. An estimated 110,000 come every year to gawk at the riches of the sultan, and receive a gift from his eminence; small packets containing money.",eccentric homes homes sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
156,The Royal Regalia Museum,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei",A well kept and well documented look at the Bruneian Sultan's life and successes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/royal-regalia-museum-bandar-seri-begawan,"Sitting just up the street from Bandar Seri Begawan’s main intersection sits the Royal Regalia Building, a building which in its splendor lies a vast collection of discarded relics and monuments to the current Sultan of Brunei, His Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu‘izzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan dan Yang Di-Pertuan Negara Brunei Darussalam. In true cult of personality style, the building – truthfully, more of a museum – houses exhibits to illustrate the important up bringing, education, marriage, travels, coronation and subsequent rule of the current Bruneian head of state. Entrance to the museum is, quite enticingly free of charge. Inside, all belongings, including cameras must be left at the counter in order to enter and enjoy the chronology of the Sultan’s life. There are replicas of His throne, various crowns, gowns, weapons and splendid examples of tributes offered to the Sultan. Gifts of elaborate crystal, jade, ivory, and silver, to name a few, serve to remind visitors of the Sultan’s inscrutable wealth. It leaves one to wonder: if such precious offerings do not even make it on a shelf of his palace, the largest personal residence in the world, how rich is this man? The most interesting sections are the life sized replica of the Sultan’s silver jubilee in 1992 and a small room which houses the many decorations to his military service. His silver jubilee is documented with a to scale model of his parade float with scores of uniformed mannequins encompassing it to represent his honour guard In another room, well over twenty different countries’ military honors and decorations exemplify the Sultan’s apparent military prowess. As one of Bandar Seri Segawan’s main attractions, the museum usually pulls in most visitors to the city. With scarce else to do in an astonishingly quiet capital city, if one is in Brunei, a stop at the Royal Regalia Building is necessary to comprehend the absolute monarchy that rules in the tiny sultanate (if not only to beat the oppressive heat). If you find Jalan Sultan (Sultan Street) you'll find the Museum. Head in the direction away from the water.",repositories of knowledge collections museums and collections museums
157,Billionth Barrel Monument,"Seria, Brunei",A monument built to commemorate the billionth barrel of oil extracted from the Seria oil field in Brunei.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/billionth-barrel-monument,"The Billionth Barrel Monument was commissioned by the Brunei Shell Petroleum Company in 1991. As the name suggests, it commemorates the billionth barrel of crude oil produced at the Seria field. The monument was erected close to the site of the first well discovered in Brunei in 1929. Its six arches, which join at the top, represent both the flow of oil from beneath the ground to the surface, as well as the number of decades of oil exploration and production that led to the billionth barrel. Atop the monument sits the national emblem of Brunei, representing the prosperity of the nation and its people. Leading up to the monument is a series of copper panels depicting various scenes from Brunei’s oil industry. And once you’ve had a look at these and the monument itself, you can take a stroll along the nearby beach. From here, you can look out to sea to the oil rigs in the distance, working tirelessly to produce the Sultan’s next billion barrels. The Billionth Barrel Monument was unveiled on July 18, 1991, by Hassanal Bolkiah, the 29th and current Sultan (and Prime Minister) of Brunei. The Sultan, whose full name is—wait for it —Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien Sultan and Yang di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, is also one of the world’s few remaining absolute monarchs. Thanks in large part to the highly productive Seria field, Hassanal Bolkiah also ranks among the wealthiest individuals in the world. You may have heard about him in the news in 2019, after he spearheaded legislation to make homosexuality and adultery punishable by death by stoning.  The Billionth Barrel Monument is located along the beach and just off Jln Tengah Street in the town of Seria on the coast of Brunei. From Bandar Seri Begawan (the capital of Brunei), you can take a bus to Seria and then a taxi to the monument, or rent a car in the capital and drive. The monument is always open, and sunset is the most popular time for visiting. Entrance is free.",oil industrial monuments
