0,Topi of Boma National Park,South Sudan,"Every October, one of the largest migration of mammals in the world thunders through Boma National Park.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/topi-antelope-boma-national-park,"Every fall the plains of South Sudan, normally pale yellow and brown, turn a vibrant viridescent shade. This explosion of greenery helps spur on one of the largest mammal migration in the world. Every October, at least a million antelope thunder across the plains towards the vast lowlands around the White Nile. An estimated 125,000 of the migration’s participants are the spectacularly weird topi. With an estimated 300,000 spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the topi migrating through South Sudan number a little less than half the entire population. These medium-sized antelopes are a deep, burnish brown with black splashes across their foreheads, thighs, and hips. They also sport light tan “socks” allowing their legs to blend into the tall grassy plains they call home. Topi are an extroverted species that have been known to socialize with animals beyond their own species, like wildebeests, zebras, and even ostriches. They are notoriously picky eaters: the topi only graze on grass and can go without water for long periods, so long as the grass is fresh and well-hydrated. Perhaps weirdest of all, female topis can actually delay birth if they sense they’re in danger. The Sudd wetland, through which the topi migrate every year, is currently on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Sudan. It’s a move that has brought more attention to the region and its animals as South Sudan’s bloody seven-year civil war came to a close in 2018. However, there are real concerns around the rise in poaching, the unregulated extraction of natural resources, and human encroachment in the Sudd. While the civil war ended in 2018, violence between armed communities has continued in South Sudan over land disputes and post-war grievances straining conservation efforts in the region. Throughout all the violence though, the topi migration has continued undeterred. Paul Elkan, head of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s South Sudan program, said in an interview, “the country’s wildlife is one of those special features of South Sudan which still arouses some hope.”",The migration occurs every October following South Sudan’s rainy season.
1,Sudd Wetland,South Sudan,The inhabitants of the world’s largest wetland have learned to navigate its dramatic seasonal changes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sudd-wetland-south-sudan,"South Sudan’s Sudd Wetland, also known as Al-Sudd, is one of the world’s largest wetlands, covering more than 35,000 square miles in the north-central part of the country. The White Nile, its many tributaries, and seasonal rainfall sustain the vast wetland. Currently being considered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Sudd is home to a vast array of flora and fauna, including endangered African elephants, an endangered antelope known as the Nile lechwe, and the critically endangered (and highly photogenic) shoebill. The Sudd is also the site of a huge antelope migration every October, including the spectacularly weird Topi. Approximately 1 million people live in the Sudd Wetland, many of whom come from Indigenous tribes that have inhabited the area for thousands of years. There are the Nuer and Dinka, two pastoralist peoples that make up the largest ethnic groups in South Sudan. Raising cattle is the primary livelihood for both of these groups, and many social rituals incorporate the animals. Husbands-to-be give cattle to family members of the bride, and Nuer priests often settle feuds through the exchange of cattle. In a centuries-old ritual, Dinka boys transition into manhood when they stop milking cows. Another group, the Shilluk, are primarily sedentary farmers. According to tradition, the physical and spiritual well-being of their chosen leader was tied to the overall prosperity of the land. The Anuak people are also farmers and maintain herds of cattle, sheep, and goats. Like many others, they also fish in the wetlands and set up seasonal fishing villages. The Neur, Dinka, Shilluk, and Anuak have all adapted to the seasonal changes of the Sudd. The Sudd’s dry season, between December to February, often sees nomadic communities move deeper into the wetland to graze their herds and hunt the Sudd’s plentiful fish. Communities, especially the Dinka, will build seasonal, circular homes on naturally-occurring islands in the wetland during the dry season. During the Sudd’s wet season, between March to August, many move back out of the Sudd to settlements near water deposits in the savanna. After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan descended into a violent civil war. During the peak of the fighting, the United Nations estimates that 65,000 to 100,000 people escaped into the Sudd, reported National Geographic. For centuries the Sudd, which literally translates to “barrier,” has been a sanctuary for people fleeing violence, slavery, and oppression. But the recent influx of so many people has meant more competition for resources in the Sudd. Foreign oil companies have also secured contracts to mine the Sudd’s naturally-occurring oil deposits, posing yet another risk to the wetland. Initial oil surveying has already polluted the delicate ecosystem. Many hope that if the Sudd does become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the international status would protect one of South Sudan’s most precious natural wonders.",Most of these communities are extremely private and are not visited by outsiders.
2,Meroe Pyramids,"Shendi, Sudan","These Nubian pyramids are strange and unique, even by pyramid standards.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/meroe-pyramids,"Slowly being reclaimed by the sands of time (literally), the pyramids of Meroë hold the fragile footprints of a mysterious and long-forgotten civilization in Sudan. Meroë was an ancient city in the Kushite Kingdom, and the sheer number of its still-standing pyramids indicate that it was a massive city, once bustling with traders and everyday inhabitants. (And, most obviously, a booming tradition of masonry.) Archaeologists have identified that the numerous pyramid structures are very clearly in the Nubian style. The structures’ sharp angles and relatively narrow footprints carry all the hallmarks of the former Kushite Kingdom, meaning Meroë was a pinnacle location in one of history’s greatest and least-understood civilizations. The kingdom stretched throughout this region in ancient times. But now, little more than the dusty pyramids standing solemnly in the desert remain of the city and, by proxy, of the Kushites it belonged to. But with more than 200 of them to mark the location, they are quite enough to astound visitors and historians alike.",
3,Suakin Island Ruins,"Suakin, Sudan",Remains of an abandoned coral city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/suakin,"For 3000 years, the port on the island of Suakin was strategically crucial to powerful empires. Located on the Red Sea in Northern Sudan, the former port of Suakin is now a crumbled relic of the wealth that passed through its coral walls from around the world. Ramses III initially developed the port of Suakin during the 10th century B.C.E. At the time, Suakin offered an outlet to the Red Sea for trade and exploration. 1000 years later, as Islam gained followers and spread from the Hijaz region of modern day Saudi Arabia, the port took on new importance and became an outlet for Africans on pilgrimage to Mecca. While Suakin constantly evolved, it remained prosperous throughout its existence, bringing great riches to the shores of Sudan. Local legend tells of a king who operated out of the old city and had 360 wives and lavish quarters in the old city. Stemming from its great wealth, Suakin developed into a rich, gated island port. Every building was made out of stunning coral and the walls were decorated in detailed wood and stone coverings. Suakin was the height of medieval luxury on the Red Sea. During the 19th century, Suakin evolved for the last time, becoming a hub for the slave trade from Eastern Africa. As the slave trade diminished, the port became increasingly unnecessary. By the 1920s, Suakin was falling into complete disrepair. Shallow waters and rough coral had pushed most trade North to Port Sudan and the coral buildings that were once the crown jewel of the port were not maintained and disintegrating. Only ruins of the once great coral city still exist and are carefully guarded as part of the tourism industry. Besides being a tourist destination, the port still serves ferries to the Saudi coast and provides access between the continents for thousands of pilgrims completing the Haj every year.",Accessible by mini-bus from the modern port
4,Précontinent II,Sudan,"All that remains of Jacques Cousteau's 1960s underwater ""village.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/precontinent-ii,"Précontinent II is the last visible reminder of a series of three French underwater habitats built between 1962 and 1965. Developed by the world-famous oceanography pioneer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the underwater “village” was supposed to be proof that it’s possible for humans to live underwater without interruption for extended periods of time, at increasing depths. The habitats were also built to explore the underwater world and conduct research for the petrol industry which financed the project. The project was named précontinent for the French word for continental shelf, the edges of a continent that are covered by ocean. Précontinent I was the word’s first underwater habitat, located in the Balearic Sea off coast from Marseille. It was completed in September 1962, two years before the American Sealab project. Two aquanauts, Albert Falco and Claude Wesly, lived in the habitat, a five-meter steel cylinder known as “Diogenes.” The habitat was fixed 11 meters under the surface of the water and fed with compressed air. Hot water came through a plastic pipe from a ship, and food in waterproofed containers. Other  “furnishings” included infrared lamps used as heaters, a record player, a radio, three telephones, a video surveillance system, a library, a TV and a bed. In the bottom of the habitat was an airlock, which allowed the two men to exit into the ocean, where they built compounds for fish and studied their behavior, and took measurements for topographical underwater maps. A year later, Précontinent II was launched about 35 km northeast, near the Sha’ab Rumi (Arabian for “Roman Reef”), off the coast of Port Sudan. The so-called Starfish House lasted for four weeks, housing a group of oceanographers as well as Madame Cousteau and the parrot Claude, who was supposed to warn the aquanauts of possible danger in the air. A second Précontinent II habitat, the “Deep Cabin”—a smaller version of the one used in Précontinent I—was installed even deeper into the sea, at 27 meters under the surface. Other structures were built including a tool shed and an air-filled hangar containing the Hydrojet Saucer DS-2, a small submarine for two people, which was equipped with three movable outside lamps, two cameras, a radio, a tape recorder and a movable grappler. The mission was to observe and collect fish and other organisms for exhibition and studies at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco. Jacques-Yves Cousteau also wanted to prove that it would be more practical to anchor offshore drilling rigs at the bottom of the ocean than to place them above water, as well as prove the existence of a richness of minerals around continental shelfs. Précontinent III was supposed to start on September 17, 1965. This time the habitat was a dome constructed on a platform, with much-improved technology, and housed several aquanauts including Jacques-Yves Cousteau. However, the launch hit a snag. The habitat had already been brought to the diving place, sealed and put under pressure when the weather turned bad. It was brought back to the harbor where the aquanauts stayed in the habitat and under pressure, waited for the weather to change. Four days later the project was launched in earnest and the habitat anchored 100 meters below the surface, off the coast of Monaco near the Cap Ferrat lighthouse. The project lasted 22 days and its mission was mainly related to oil production—for example, how to assemble a drill head under water. This was the last mission of the Précontinent series, even though six missions in total were planned. Jacques-Yves Cousteau changed his mind and decided he didn’t want to be a part of research for the petrol industry anymore. Instead he dedicated his career to the exploration and protection of the world’s oceans from then on. From the three Précontinent missions only part of Précontinent II remains underwater, and has become the site of many diving tours from Sudan and Egypt. At the anchor place of the habitat you can find the remains of the tool shed, crusted with coral growth, and the fish cages, covered with sponges. A few meters deeper are the shark cages, covered with coral and crustacean, and the hangar, which still stands anchored in the bottom of the ocean, still filled with air and possible to enter.",Diving tours can be booked through various sites on the internet.
5,Jebel Barkal,"Marawi, Sudan",Crumbling pyramids and temple ruins stand within the shadow of this sacred butte.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jebel-barkal,"Weathered pyramids spike upward amid sweeping stretches of golden desert sand. They stand in the shadow of Jebel Barkal, a small butte that was considered sacred thousands of years ago. The Egyptians, then later the Kushites, transformed the 322-foot-tall sandstone monolith into a trove of architectural treasures. Roughly a dozen pyramids are scattered around the base of the mountain, as are the ruins of temples, statues, and hieroglyphics. One of the temples was dedicated to the god Amun, who was believed to live atop the butte. The Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III first extended his empire to include Jebel Barkal around 1450 BC. Later pharaohs and Kush rulers oversaw the construction of the many pyramids that still stand around the landmark. The Kushites restored the neglected temples and continued building more structures around the base of the butte. But in the many centuries since the Kushites ruled the land, the stately pyramids have fallen into disrepair. The temples are little more than fragmented ruins, partially buried beneath the sand. The structures at Jebel Barkal are among the many pyramids that dot the Sudanese landscape, as the country has more than twice the amount of pyramids as Egypt. However, many of these sites are far off the typical tourist track, meaning those who take a trip to Sudan will likely have these monuments all to themselves.",The pyramids of Jebel Barkal are within walking distance from Karima city center.
6,Sheikh Hamad-al Nil Tomb,"Omdurman, Sudan","Every Friday, Sufi dervishes whirl around the tomb in a trance-like state as part of a sacred ritual called dhikr.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sheikh-hamadal-nil-tomb,"Every Friday evening, Sufi dervishes perform a ritual called dhikr at the tomb of Sheikh Hamad-al Nil, a 19th-century Sufi leader. The devotees dance and work themselves into a frenzy while reciting Allah’s name, helping to create a state of ecstatic abandon that supposedly allows their hearts to communicate directly with God. The ceremony begins when the dervishes make their entrance to the cemetery dressed in colorful patchwork robes with bright beads draped around their necks. They then proceed to a patch of cleared ground in front of the mosque while banging drums and chanting while a man attempts to enforce the perimeter boundary. Although he carries a large club, he still struggles to maintain order as the crowd is, by now, wild with excitement. Fights break out among the more belligerent adherents who appear to taunt each other (quickly dealt with by the club-wielding man). Wild-eyed priests dance around the perimeter and blow incense into the faces peering out from the mass of spectators. The proceedings become more electric as the evening wears on. The rhythmic chants of “La Illaha Illallah” (there is no god but Allah) become hypnotic. Every so often a devotee breaks off from the main group, spinning in a blur of arms and legs. With eyes rolling, the dancer seems to enter into a trance-like state before collapsing onto the ground. The ceremony begins around 4:30. Visitors are treated with respect despite the fighting and theatrical bad tempers among devotees. It’s hard not to be swept along with the ritual. When it ends, you almost feel as if you’ve suddenly snapped out of your own trance.",It is better to have a local guide to help experience this ceremony. They know the best place to be positioned to get a good view and can match the belligerence of the locals to get you there (in a way which would probably best not be attempted by a tourist!).
7,Western Deffufa of Kerma,"Kerma Albeled, Sudan",The best-preserved example of a unique structure in Nubian architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/western-deffufa-kerma,"The word defuffa is thought to derive from either the Nubian word for a mud-brick building or the Arabic word daffa, meaning “pile.” There are only three deffufa remaining in the world, all of which are located at the former site of the Nubian Kingdom of Kerma, which existed between 2500 and 1500 B.C. The remains of the walled city of Kerma is one of the largest archaeological sites in ancient Nubia. Archaeologists have identified a system of roads and well-differentiated neighborhoods. It is likely that this metropolis was reserved for members of the royal elite and the ruling class. Though Nubian rulers maintained the kingdom’s independence for nearly a thousand years, the kingdom of Kerma ended around 1450 B.C. with the conquest of Kush by Egypt. Even today, the Western Deffufa dominates the ruins of Kerma. It measures 18 meters (59 feet) tall, with columned rooms, passageways, paintings, and a shrine. It is the best-preserved example of this structure in Nubian architecture. The deffufa once functioned as a temple and the religious center of the city. It has multiple levels, with an interior staircase connecting the floors and leading up to a rooftop platform. Additional chambers underground were accessible through galleries. Evidence of a limestone altar, built for animal sacrifice, was also found. Though the precise functions of the deffufa are not fully known, it is believed they were connected to religious and burial practices. About two kilometers (1.2 miles) away lie the remains of the Eastern Deffufa, which is believed to be a funerary chapel and burial ground. Excavations at Kerma started with an Egyptian and Sudanese survey made by American archaeologist George A. Reisner in the early 20th century. Following up on that work, Swiss archaeologist Charles Bonnet led a series of excavations at the site from 1977 to 2003. It was this work that helped uncover evidence of Kerma as a large, independent urban settlement, rather than an Egyptian satellite as initially thought.",Kerma is located in central Sudan and is easily reached by public transport from either Khartoum or Karima.
8,Church Pillars of Sai Island,"Wadi Halfa, Sudan",These pillars are one of the few remnants from the mysterious lost empire of Makuria.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sai-island,"Sai Island is a tiny island in the Nile stretching just five kilometers across and 12 kilometers long, but it contains ruins spanning thousands of years and several empires. Though Sudan is now primarily an Islamic country, a medieval Christian empire known as Makuria flourished in Sudan between the 7th and 14th centuries. Despite the length of its existence, there are still many unanswered questions about Makuria and its people. Sai Island was once a bishop’s see (residence). The last remnants of the church of Sai Island can be seen as a few lonely pillars surrounded by pottery and masonry remnants. Old Dongola, to the south of Sai Island, is the only other archaeological site surviving from the Makurian empire. Sadly, when Lake Nasser was created much of what was northern Makuria was flooded including one of its main religious centers, the site of the Cathedral of Faras. There are other ruins on Sai Island, including the foundations of an Egyptian town and temple that date back to 1500 B.C., with the ruins of an Ottoman fort built on the site of the town. There are also Islamic cemeteries on the island with their characteristic dome-shaped tombs.","Sai Island is about four kilometers south of the town of Abri. Opposite the northern tip of the island from the banks of the Nile, a ferry operates to and from Sai Island. There is a fee for visiting the island which is generally payable in U.S. currency. Be aware that there is no set place to pay, and therefore it is reliant on the official making contact with you during your trip."
9,Battle of Abu Klea Memorial,"Al Matammah, Sudan",A remote monument to one of the fiercest battles fought by the Victorian British Army.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/battle-of-abu-klea-memorial,"Far out in the Bayuda desert, seven hours’ drive north of Khartoum, lies an almost forgotten memorial to a very famous battle, Abu Klea. On the 17th of January, 1885, a British column of approximately 1,400 men on its way to relieve the besieged General Gordon in Khartoum was attacked by 13,000 Mahdist forces. Even though the action didn’t last that long (about 15 minutes), Abu Klea has become infamous as one of the hardest battles ever fought by the British Army. In that brief period, extreme violence occurred that turned “the sand of the desert sodden red” with the blood of over 1,000 Dervish and 81 British troops killed. It was also one of the few occasions a British square had been broken by “native” troops, as immortalized in Rudyard Kipling’s poem “Fuzzy Wuzzy.” A memorial stone erected shortly after the battle names the British dead and marks the spot where the front left of the square was approximately positioned. The battle site is in a remote area not easily reached and therefore rarely visited, but for those who make the journey little has changed in 132 years. A lunar landscape added to the ferocious heat and stinging wind make for a hostile environment, walking on the ironstone surface makes matters even jollier as electric shocks are created with virtually anything subsequently touched. It really doesn’t take much imagination to picture the fierce fighting which took place there under such harsh conditions. Graves of British soldiers dot the surrounding area; they are marked with stones and their bones are, according to local tribesmen, occasionally uncovered due to the relentless wind. Those same locals appear to treat the site with a wary respect and claim the place is visited by spirits of the dead. If there was one truly haunted place on Earth then surely there could not be many better contenders than this.","The only practical way to reach Abu Klea is with the help of local people, it is mostly off-road driving across the Bayuda desert and involves at least a one night stay in a local village, there is no village close to the site itself. Travel Agents in Khartoum are willing to arrange the trip for a reasonable sum, including an overnight village stay. Be prepared for most of the village residents deciding to come along for the ride as “advisors”!"
10,Goz Abu Goma Bridge,"Kosti, Sudan",One of the largest early 20th-century bridges in Sudan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goz-abu-goma-bridge,"Stretching across the White Nile in southern Sudan, near the city of Kosti, the Goz Abu Goma Bridge is almost exactly a third of a mile long. Walkways line both sides of the railroad tracks that traverse the teal, truss bridge, which is the largest of its kind in Sudan. The Goz Abu Goma Bridge is a swing bridge, which can open at its center like a door, allowing large boat traffic to safely pass by on the White Nile below. When it was in operation, the railway linked Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, to southern cities like El Obeid. However, the southern parts of the railroad have been little used since the South Sudan Civil War broke out in 2013. The Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company, a company based in Darlington, England, built the bridge between 1909 and 1910. It was one of the most ambitious building projects the company took on in the early 20th century. The far-reaching Cleveland Company built bridges across the world in many countries either part of the British empire or where England held significant sway. Before 1925, the company constructed bridges in Shanghai, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, and the Isle of Man. The Sudanese Goz Abu Goma Bridge was the last they completed before World War I enveloped the globe. The British colonial administration of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan had commissioned the massive bridge, which stretched 500 feet longer than any other bridge the company had previously built.",The bridge is best seen from either side of the White Nile. Please get permission before attempting to cross the bridge.
11,Lake Natron,"Monduli, Tanzania",A salty red wasteland in Tanzania is a breeding spot for endangered flamingos.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-natron,"Don’t let the ring of salty marshes along the edge of Lake Natron fool you. This body of water is one of the most inhospitable areas on Earth. Colored a deep red from salt-loving organisms and algae, the lake reaches hellish temperatures and is nearly as basic as ammonia. Although most human settlements throughout history have formed around lakes and rivers, the barren landscape around Lake Natron tells a clear story of a place no one ever wanted to live. Africa’s Great Rift Valley is known for some of its environmentally extreme regions such as the Erta Ale and Dallol. The saline environment of Lake Natron certainly qualifies. Water is supposed to give life, yet this salty world seems content to make life almost impossible… almost. Although most species cannot handle the 120-degree lake water, cyanobacteria have made Natron their home and turned the lake its trademark reds and oranges. This algae growth has also fostered the developments of Lesser Flamingo nests. Amazingly, 2.5 million flamingos make Lake Natron their home and it is considered one of their only breeding grounds, making preservation of the lake an environmental concern. In fact, bringing in fresh water would greatly upset the ecological balance of the lake and many in Tanzania have actively fought against bringing in water from the Ewaso Ng’iro River. If the salinity of the lake decreases, the cyanobacteria will also decrease and cause a loss of habitat for the endangered flamingos. Besides losing a bird habitat, the world would also lose a beautiful and salty natural wonder if too much water is diverted south to Natron.",
12,The Rock,"Michamvi, Tanzania","Sitting atop a rock on Michamvi Pingwe beach, this restaurant becomes its own island at high tide.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-rock-zanzibar,"Once the site of a fisherman’s post, The Rock restaurant sits perched atop a rock off the eastern coast of Unguja Island in the Zanzibar archipelago. The establishment is on what’s known as a “tidal island”—it rises above the sand on Michamvi Pingwe beach at low tide, but becomes an island at high tide. Depending on the time of day, voyagers arrive on foot or by boat. After climbing a wooden staircase to reach the entrance, diners enjoy unobstructed views of the Indian Ocean from one of 12 cozy tables beneath a Makuti palm tree roof. Patrons sip cocktails out on the back patio, which—at certain hours—is surrounded by turquoise water on three sides. The restaurant serves both lunch and dinner, so parties can time their meal reservations to match the desired tide level. The menu, which is largely European-inspired, highlights local seafood and house-made pasta. The Rock’s chefs offer guests a selection of globally-recognizable options, but they also aim to impart the flavors of Zanzibar and the surrounding region in every dish. The fish carpaccio is served with coconut, lime, and chili pepper. Most desserts (which range from chocolate salami to pineapple flambé) come topped with “Zanzibar spices” ice cream. Their beef, spices, and vegetables are all farmed nearby. While dining at The Rock is exponentially more expensive than dining elsewhere in Zanzibar, the restaurant, which opened in 2010, sponsors the Kichanga Foundation. Established in 2005, this organization teaches community members how to swim and focuses on a number of sustainability programs, including waste sorting and recycling.","The Rock offers two lunch seatings (at noon or 2pm), and two dinner seatings (at 4pm or 6pm), both by reservation only."
13,Kilwa Kisiwani Ruins,"Kilwa Masoko, Tanzania",Stunning ruins of what was once the center of one of the greatest empires in East Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kilwa-kisiwani-ruins,"Situated off the coast of Tanzania, the island of Kilwa Kisiwani (“isle of the fish”) was once the center of one of the greatest empires in East Africa. From the 9th century all the way up until the 19th century, Kilwa Kisiwani was a wealthy and powerful port, reaching its peak around the late-Middle Ages. At its height, the empire stretched from Kenya to Mozambique, and Kilwa Kisiwani’s prosperity was crucial to the development of Swahili civilization. During this time great structures were built that are now stunning ruins, all that’s left of the late empire. One of the most impressive of the ruins is the Great Mosque, the oldest standing mosque on the East African coast, which has 16 domes supported by many arches and pillars. Another amazing site is the Palace of Husuni Kubwa, which overlooks the island from on high and was once the largest building in sub-Saharan Africa. According to legend, the empire was established on the island by a Persian prince who bought Kilwa Kisiwani from an indigenous king for enough cloth to circle the island. The prince then destroyed a bridge that connected the island to mainland Tanzania. Kilwa Kisiwani grew rich and powerful because it was well placed on trading routes between Africa, China, India, and Arabia. Gold, porcelain, quartz, ivory, and other valuable treasures all passed through the island. Among the island’s own exports were spices, tortoiseshell, and slaves.  The start of its decline came in the 16th century, when the Portuguese completed their own fort on the island and came to dominate trade in the region.","You have to register for a permit to visit the island at the local antiquities office, it's simple admin, no one had visited for 2 weeks when we arrived. You must take a local dhow (traditional sail boat) out to the island"
14,Zanzibar's Night Market,"Zanzibar, Tanzania",After sunset the heart of Zanzibar's historic Stone Town neighborhood transforms into a culinary playground.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zanzibars-night-market,"By day, life around Zanzibar’s Forodhani Gardens moves at a leisurely pace: tourists and locals stroll down the seawalk, either sidestepping the eager advances of the city’s ravenous stray cats and taking in the views of an impossibly crystalline Indian Ocean. On the outskirts of Zanzibar’s historical Stone Town, this small park awaits the lucky travelers that manage to navigate their way through the heart of this historical neighborhood’s labyrinth of narrow streets. After sunset, this quiet corner of Stone Town is almost unrecognizable. The once calm Seawalk is rapidly filled with chefs, clad in white hats, setting up gas lamps, grills and rotisseries, spreading out their wares across rows of tables. The Night Market is a culinary playground for all—visitors and locals pour in, families gather with small children, and of course, the tenacious stray cats hunker down and wait for scraps. The chefs are a blur of motion, excitedly pointing to their culinary creations, cooing and coaxing until even the most hesitant eater gives in to their expertly spun sales pitches. The Night Market perhaps best represents Zanzibar’s wonderful amalgamation of cultures and cuisines. Zanzibar was once a trading center, at the intersection of the spice trade, the slave trade and the ivory trade. Arab, Persian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Indian, and Chinese merchants passed through or migrated to the island, leaving a lasting impact on Swahili culture. The vestiges of Zanzibar’s often tragic history linger in many ways; most noticeably in the unique blend of cultures on the Market’s signature white cardboard plates. Dishes vary widely, from Zanzibari pizza, falafel as big as your face, sugar cane juice, enormous samosas, coconut bread, seafood skewers (although debate persists pertaining to the actual freshness of the market’s pescetarian offerings), and crepes dripping with ribbons of chocolate syrup. For the culinary curious and history buffs alike, Stone Town is a magical little corner of Zanzibar, and the Night Market offers a glimpse at an expansive (and appetizing) history and culture—even if it means fighting with a covetous cat over that last morsel of crepe.",Make sure you bring Tanzanian shillings with you and be prepared to barter if you want to avoid overpaying for your culinary exploration. The Old Fort and the House of Wonders are adjacent to Forodhani Gardens and may provide a nice pre-sunset excursion while you wait for the Night Market to open.

In reality each corner is tethered to the ocean floor, so have no fear about floating adrift at sea. Guests are anchored in place, but they have submarine views of the ocean life around them. A little wooden structure, serenely set atop the turquoise ocean waters. Guests can swim (obviously), sunbathe and stargaze on the suite’s deck; pristine views of the Milky Way are visible due to Pemba’s physical isolation. But of course the Underwater Room’s real appeal lies, well, underwater. Beneath the wooden deck is a cozy bedroom containing just one neat little bed, but beyond the windows on all four sides is the blue wonderland of the Indian Ocean. Entire schools of fish eddy past, and curious angelfish may peer in to see what you’re up to.",
16,Kuza Cave,"Kusini, Tanzania","This sacred, circular cave is lined with pools so clear and still that it's hard to tell where the water begins.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuza-cave,"Remarkably pristine pools, some more than eight feet deep, line the cave’s perimeter. The stillness of the water reflects a backdrop of stalagmites and stalactites, making it difficult to discern where the water ends and the cave wall begins. Once the eye has adjusted, it’s possible to spot several openings that lead deeper underground. To date, these subterranean portals have yet to be explored. Kuza Cave is a geological formation with a long, fascinating history. The Jambiani area, where the cave is located, was and still is characterized by countless underground rivers that snake beneath a relatively flat landscape. Some 250,000 years ago, the constant erosion of these underground rivers flowing between two hard layers of limestone caused the upper layer to weaken and buckle. From this collapse, Kuza Cave was born. The new access to the revealed river created an easily accessible source of fresh water, which attracted animals and humans alike. Bones found strewn about the cave and surrounding area prove that giraffes, zebras, and waterbuck frequented it. And the marks on the bones, inflicted by sharp tools, indicate humans were present, too. The cave has long been a sacred space for the local people. For thousands of years, they’ve journeyed to this spot within the Earth’s underbelly to hold ceremonies and pray. It’s still a place of religious worship, and is closed to the public when ceremonies are in progress. When the cave is open (which it usually is), it offers a surreal, peaceful glimpse into a wondrous underground world.","Kuza Cave has been the site of ancestor worship for thousands of years. It is, therefore, possible that access to it may be restricted due to a ceremony that’s only open to locals. However, these ceremonies are rare. On a regular basis, visitors can report to the Kuza Cave Culture Centre, which will provide a guide to the cave and a short but informative lecture on the cave. Half of the proceeds fund educational programs in the village."
17,Ol Doinyo Lengai,"Ngorongoro, Tanzania",This rare volcano spews the strangest and (literally) coolest lava in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ol-doinyo-lengai,"Along the East Africa Ridge in Tanzania emerges a volcano known as Ol Doinyo Lengai, translating from Maasai to “Mountain of God.” Such a name would signify a volcano of immense power, but the defining feature of Ol Doinyo Lengai is something else entirely. The Tanzanian volcano, sprouting over 10,000 feet tall in the middle of a plain, is the only active volcano on Earth spewing carbonatite lava instead of silica, a rare chemical makeup that yields some bizarre results. The lava that flows from Ol Doinyo Lengai is uniquely cool: At “only” up to 950 degrees Fahrenheit, it is nearly twice as cold as silicate magma. This relatively cool temperature colors the lava black and grey in daylight, instead of glowing the quintessential red (except sometimes at night). When the lava is hardened, it solidifies as a unique shade of white. And since the magma can cool and harden in seconds once it makes contact with this atmosphere, it sometimes shatters in mid-air and sprinkles down the slopes. Unlike the silicate magma of most volcanoes, composed mainly of silica and oxygen, the carbonatite lava emitted by Ol Doinyo Lengai contains alkali elements such as calcium, sodium, and potassium (this lava is so sodium rich that it’s a “natrocarbonatite”). Aside from the unique temperature and color this yields, the lava emitted by Ol Doinyo Lengai is also known to be the least viscous and most “runny” in the world. The lava is not just spouted from the main crater either; little peaks on the volcano’s surface called “hornitos” spew the wacky stuff as well. For all these reasons, the volcano is a favorite among scientists, as it’s easier to study than its dangerously hot counterparts—in fact, it’s sometimes called a “toy volcano.” It’s so relatively safe that reportedly a hiker once fell into the volcano once, and while burned, managed to survive.",
18,Selous Game Preserve,"Liwale, Tanzania",The largest game reserve in Africa is home to thousands of species but refuses to house humans.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/selous-game-preserve,"Watching a lioness devour her fresh kill in the Selous Game Preserve has a tendency to remind visitors in their open air trucks that the nearest village is two days drive in any direction. Officially established as a protected area in 1896 when Tanzania was still a British colony, the Selous Game Preserve is located in the south of Tanzania, and is comprised of over 21,000 square miles of remote swamps, hills and grasslands. Unlike a lot of the more touristy safari spots on the Serengeti where competing guides jockey for position, the Selous Preserve feels incredibly remote thanks to the provision that prohibits any permanent habitation within the preserve’s boundaries. It’s possible to book a tour on this sprawling grassland and not see another soul the entire time. The Selous area is home to a staggering number of wildlife species, so much so that the location was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unspoiled beauty. The area has populations of vultures, crocodiles, lions, cape buffalo, hippos, and literally thousands of other species of plants and animals, all virtually undisturbed by human interaction. Hyenas stalk and kill their prey. Elephants lazily graze in the sun. Even rhinos can be found on the grounds, although sightings are rare, a sad testament to that animals’ continuing endangered status. The park also contains the gravesite of its namesake Frederick Selous, the British explorer and conservationist who was killed battling with German troops in the area during World War I. Selous knew the beauty and tranquility of this remote corner of the country, and thanks to his effort and foresight visitors to the preserve can continue to experience that beauty for themselves.",
19,Mercury House,"Zanzibar, Tanzania",Freddie Mercury's childhood home is now a monument to the iconic Queen rockstar.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mercury-house,"While walking around the island of Zanzibar, you’ll come across an unexpected place: a monument to Freddie Mercury, the famous vocalist and songwriter for the rock band Queen. On a small road in Stone Town, the historic center of Zanzibar, stands what’s dubbed the Mercury House. Mercury spent parts of his childhood within this house. He was born in Zanzibar, as his parents were living there so that his father, Bomi Bulsara, could continue working with the British Colonial Office as a cashier. Although some dispute the history, many historians believe that as a child, Mercury spent his holidays at this home in Zanzibar and his school years attending class in India. When living in Stone Town, Mercury and his parents would regularly attend the nearby Zoroastrian temple. Although Mercury returned to Zanzibar at age 18 to live with his parents, he fled to England the next year to escape the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution, which overthrew the Sultan and killed thousands of Arabs and Indians. There, he would form Queen and spend the rest of his years. The facade of the house features a small monument with pictures of Mercury throughout his childhood and life.","The Mercury House is located on Kenyatta Road in the heart of Stone Town, Zanzibar."
20,Laetoli Footprints,"Ngorongoro, Tanzania",Human ancestor’s 3.6 million year-old footprints.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laetoli-footprints,"Roughly 3.6 millions years ago the Sadiman Volcano erupted covering the surrounding ground in ash; rain soon followed making a soft and muddy ground over which prehistoric animals trekked. More ash then erupted from the volcano covering and, in effect, preserving the prehistoric tracks. Forward to 1978, when a group of researchers (led by paleoanthropologist Mary Leakey) discovered the preserved tracks, within which were the oldest known footprints of human ancestors. From the prehistoric footprint’s shape, length, and toes it was evident that these hominids were bipedal and were walking upright on two legs, before even the use of stone tools. The prints were left by two or three hominids (one or two adults and a child) and show that these early humans walked in a very similar manner as modern humans. Today, the actual footprints have been covered up in hopes of protecting them, but due to fear of erosion they are planned to be uncovered again. Whether the prints remain at their discovered location (with a possible museum built over them) or are to be cut-out and moved entirely is currently under debate. For now visitors can visit the covered up site of discovery and the nearby Olduvai Gorge Museum, which features casts of the prints and related artifacts.",
21,Shifting Sand Dunes,"Ngorongoro, Tanzania",These strange piles of magnetized volcanic ash travel across the desert about 50 feet per year.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shifting-sand-dunes-olduvai-gorge,"Lost in a nondescript part of the savannah, near the Olduvai Gorge on the road to the Serengeti, are two crescent-shaped sand dunes. The sand is remarkably dark, especially in comparison with the soil surrounding the dunes. This is because it is highly magnetized volcanic ash, which explains why the particles tend to falls back on the dunes instead of being blown away by the wind. In fact, it is possible to throw a handful of sand in the air and see how it clamps together and re-joins the dunes.  However, when strong winds blow, these sand dunes, also known as barkan, begin to move. Slowly but surely, they travel through the desert, at an average of 55 feet (17 meters) a year. It’s estimated that these shifting sand dunes have been wandering the savannah for 3 million years. Although this phenomenon is rare, it is not completely unique, and its origins have been ascertained. If volcanic ash is rich in iron, it can become magnetized, and when it is blown by the winds, it may start collecting around a rock. Given a sufficient amount of time, this little mound can become a dune. The local Maasai people believe the shifting sand dunes have come from the nearby sacred mountain Ol Doinyo Lengai, loosely translated as the Mountain of God (where God resides). As a consequence, these dunes are also considered sacred by the Maasai, who convene by the dunes in cases of prolonged draught. On these occasions, a goat is sacrificed to the gods so that rain may come soon. Understandably, climbing the sand dunes is inappropriate.","The dunes are located near Olduvai Gorge within Ngorongoro Conservation Area, along the road to Serengeti National Park.The trails leading to the area where the shifting sand dunes roam require a 4x4 vehicle in the dry season, and visiting the dunes shortly after a rainfall is not recommended, as the trails can turn into impassable mud pits."
22,Shop #47 at Mwenge Woodcarvers Market,"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",An exquisite and eclectic selection of African masks stands out within a massive woodcarving marketplace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shop-47-at-mwenge-woodcarvers-market,"Seen from the main road, Mwenge Woodcarvers Market could hardly be more nondescript, but enter through the opening in the center and you’ll find yourself standing in the middle of around 100 stores displaying a wide array of wonderful woodwork. Most of the woodcarvings in the stores are neatly polished and displayed in orderly fashion. You can find most imaginative reinventions of everyday objects, various ornaments that range in size from miniature figurines to life-size statues of humans and animals. One special feature of this market is that you can actually see the artists working on the sculptures. Shop #47 stands out at Mwenge Woodcarvers Market for its huge collection of ceremonial masks collected from all over Africa. The shopkeeper can provide information regarding the masks’ countries of origin, approximate age, and use. As the masks come from different regions of Africa, they were carved out of different kinds of wood, which is evident in the rainbow of grains and colors. Most masks are colorfully painted—red, black, orange, brown, and white are the most common—and some are adorned with ornamental items including seashells, metal, pottery, horns, teeth, straw, fabric, and hair. The quality and complexity of the mask reflects the importance of the ritual it was used in. In religious rituals, masks can symbolize a specific spiritual being, and as a rule of thumb, the more important the divinity, the more elaborate the mask. While some masks resemble an abstract version of a human face, others portray animals’ muzzles with different degrees of anthropomorphism. In the latter case, the mask wearer inhabits the intermediate world between human and animal, and as such he or she can communicate with both. A legitimate question to ask is whether these masks were produced for the market or for ceremonies. This is a question that not even the most expert in the field can answer with certainty, especially if considering that a woodcarver may well produce a number of masks with comparable quality and artistry, some of which may find their way to the market, while others may be selected for specific rituals.",
23,The House of Wonders,"Zanzibar, Tanzania","In Zanzibar, a historic 19th-century palace is a reminder of the world's shortest war.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-wonders,"In the center of Stone Town, the most historic part of Zanzibar City, is a 19th-century palace that was part of the shortest war in history. The House of Wonders was constructed in 1883 by Barghash bin Said, the second Sultan of Zanzibar, as a ceremonial palace. Barghash made the door extra wide so he could enter the house on the back of an elephant, and the building’s large pillars and two-story clock tower were covered in white paint. From the get-go, the house was adorned with electricity and a working elevator, the first in all of East Africa to do so. The House of Wonders was thriving until 1896 when Khalid bin Barghash seized the throne after his cousin—the ruling Sultan at the time—passed away. This angered British forces in the area, who launched a naval bombardment of Stone Town for just 38 minutes in what’s known as the shortest war in world history. Although the attack damaged the House of Wonders, the building’s upper floor was still used as the home of the succeeding Sultan (who was sympathetic to the British). The brilliant white palace was used as a government facility for decades until 1990, when it became abandoned and began to crumble. Fortunately, due to the building’s fantastic history and cultural significance, large efforts were made to preserve it and turn it into a museum. The House of Wonders is now open to the public, allowing visitors to walk through the corridors and rooms of the house and see a 56-foot mtepe ship, bronze cannons from the 1500s, and track from the now-defunct Zanzibar Railroad. The museum displays the blend of Portuguese, English, Omani, and Swahili culture that can be found in Zanzibar through its traditional Swahili garments, David Livingstone’s medical chest, and carved wooden doors inscribed with phrases from the Quran. The House of Wonders proves that beyond Zanzibar’s white sand beaches rests a fascinating history and culture. Update as of January 2021: It appears the building has collapsed.","As of August 2018, the House of Wonders is under renovation. You can see the exterior by venturing to the center of Stone Town and finding the corner of Sokoku Street and Mizingani Street, next to the Old Fort, and you can visit the interior once it reopens."
24,Engaruka Ruins,"Monduli, Tanzania",The culture that built these Tanzanian ruins displayed advanced knowledge of irrigation technology before mysteriously disappearing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/engaruka-ruins,"The history of Africa, and the Rift Valley in particular, is not a static one. Throughout history, the movement of different groups of people - hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, agriculturalists - have created one of the most unique and complex landscapes on the planet. The archaeological remains of this part of the world thus remain enigmatic, with few links between the people who created them and those who inhabit the area in the present day. So it is with the Engaruka ruins, which today overlook a dusty arm of the Rift Valley in north-western Tanzania. The story, as told by the archaeology, is vague. Sometime in the 15th century, locals began experimenting with the small-scale cultivation of indigenous African crops such as millet and sorghum. Over the next three centuries, however, their success in these small-scale endeavors led to a vast expansion in the farming system and a significant increase in population. A huge amount of labour was invested over this time in building furrows to canalize the Engaruka River and redistribute water to the fields, which sprawled at the foot of the Rift escarpment. Large terraces were constructed, repaired, and reconstructed such that over time, they reached a cumulative height of over 3 meters in places. On the slopes overlooking these fields, villages expanded to incorporate a burgeoning population, which at its height may have included over 8000 men, women, and children. Visiting the site today, its location does nothing to betray its prominent history. What once may have been one of the biggest inland centers in eastern Africa is now a quiet corner of Tanzania, on the edge of the much more popular and touristic Ngorogoro Conservation Area. The road to get here is long and unpaved. You must either catch the bus that runs twice a day from Mto wa Mbu on the shore of Lake Manyara, or else risk life and limb on a one-and-a-half-hour dirt bike (‘Piki-Piki’) ride through the bush. Either way, you are not likely to encounter any of the safari traffic of Ngorogoro, but instead the rush-hour gridlock of dozens of Maasai pastoralists herding their goats in the middle of the road. Once here, the climb up the Rift escarpment to the location of the village can be brutal in the midday 40°C heat. You may wonder, among the other unsolved mysteries of the site, why in God’s name the inhabitants of Engaruka chose to build on a slope like this. Then, looking back over the abandoned field system stretched out below, you may begin to realize what a huge project the building of this site was, and what a significant place it must have been. Tally this with how little is known about the site, and the questions multiply. For all its “natural” wonders, the human agency that created the landscape of eastern Africa is often overlooked. In fact, much of what is considered ‘natural’ about the east Africa landscape is the product of thousands of years of human interaction with and within the environment. The Serengeti plains, for instance, are a carefully managed anthropogenic landscape that has been shaped through the sustained grazing of pastoralist herds for the past two thousand years. This makes Engaruka even more important as a site: for standing out as a testament to the rich human history of an area of the world whose human history is often forgotten. Sometime in the 18th century, the villages of Engaruka were abandoned and the fields at the foot of the Rift escarpment ceased to be cultivated. On par with the rest of what is known about the site, the reasons for this sudden desertion are unexplained. Nowadays, locals at the modern village of Engaruka, about four kilometers from the ancient site, have their own theories about who lived here 500 years ago, while archaeologists return again and again with ever more elaborate equipment to answer ever more elaborate questions. The answers to these questions, however, will necessarily rely in part on mere speculation.","Local buses run twice a day in the afternoon from Mto wa Mbu to Engaruka, journey time about 1.5 hours. Alternatively, local motorbike taxis ('Piki-Pikis') can be hired to make journeys out to Engaruka village."
25,Slave Market Memorial,"Zanzibar, Tanzania",This monument is a stark reminder of the horrors of the Zanzibar slave trade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/slave-market-memorial,"In 1873 the world’s last open slave market closed. The last vestige of this horrific institution was located in Stone Town, Zanzibar. Enslaved people were transported to Zanzibar via overcrowded dhows. With little food, rampant disease, and appalling conditions, not all of the captives survived long enough to reach Zanzibar. Those who didn’t were thrown overboard. For those that did make it, another ordeal awaited, as they were sold at this site and then were likely shipped off to various Arab countries. Zanzibar was home to one of the largest slave markets in the world.  Although the slave trade took place all over the island, three major markets saw the bulk of these inhumane transactions. The market in Stone Town was infamous for being the most brutal. The pit and the Slave Market Memorial is in the same location where enslaved people were gathered to be brought and sold.  This memorial was created in 1998 by Clara Sornas of Scandinavia. On one side of the memorial is a mansion housing the slave cellar, one of fifteen low-ceiling chambers. Dim, suffocating, and with no toilets, these chambers were crammed with enslaved people, where they awaited the auction block. Captives were summoned to the yard and marched to the pit. There, they would be inspected by potential buyers. On the other side of the memorial is an Anglican church, from which you can see a mosque. A circle of white stones at the altar marks the place where the whipping post once stood  The value of enslaved people on Zanzibar was often based on how much pain they could endure at this post. An outer circle of red stones represents the bloodshed that took place. Unveiled in 1998, the Slave Market Memorial is a reminder of the sordid history of this island.",
26,Tippu Tip's House,"Zanzibar, Tanzania",This slowly crumbling mansion was home to one of East Africa's richest and most powerful slave traders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tippu-tips-house,"Stroll down Suicide Alley south from Kelele Square and you’ll pass a short flight of marble steps leading up to a heavy wooden door, its elaborate but weathered carvings hinting at the home’s former glory. This was the residence of Tippu Tip, a slave trader, ivory merchant, and plantation owner who was once a mighty figure in Zanzibar and a force to be reckoned with on the African continent. The story of Tippu Tip, whose real name was Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi, is straight out of the adventure books of old. Born in 1832 to a family of some standing, he left for Central Africa at an early age in search of ivory and enslaved people. His quest was fruitful, and he returned to Zanzibar with the spoils of his plundering. Tippu Tip then went on to build himself a vast trading empire, his ruthlessness and financial acumen turning him into one of the region’s leading merchants. Along the way, he encountered explorers such as David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley. He claimed the Eastern Congo for the Sultan of Zanzibar, and was made governor of the Stanley Falls District in the Congo Free State. He led troops in the Congo Arab War, and all the while maintained control of his extensive assets. By his mid-50s, Tippu Tip realized that the growing European influence in Africa was changing the trading dynamic on the continent. His influence in the Congo was also diminishing rapidly with the rise of Belgian colonization. After carefully considering his options, he returned to Zanzibar where he used his fortune to develop seven valuable clove plantations, and to manage his enslaved workers, who now numbered close to 10,000. Back in Zanzibar, Tippu Tip had a mansion built in the historic Stone Town area of the city. With its elegant balconies and carved wooden fittings, the large townhouse was befitting of the status of a man like Tippu Tip, who retired here as a wealthy and highly respected upper-class gentleman of Swahili society. After his death in 1905, the house remained a private residence until the Zanzibar Revolution in 1964. Then began its slow decline. It was converted into a block of flats, and is now occupied by various families of modest means. Today, its arched doorways are crisscrossed with laundry lines, its wide wooden stairways rickety and close to collapse, and the once elegant carved wooden screens stand chipped and peeling in the rays of the Zanzibar sun.","Tippu Tip's house is not officially open to the public. Intrigued visitors often pass by the front door and may get a glimpse of the courtyard within. If you're lucky, however, residents of the building might invite you in for an informal tour. A tip is appreciated and typically expected."
27,Unguja Ukuu,"Unguja Ukuu, Tanzania",A remote island settlement off the coast of Tanzania is a storied archaeological site with an ancient past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/unguja-ukuu,"Located on Unguja, the largest of two principal islands that constitute the Zanzibar Archipelago, Unguja Ukuu is a far-flung village off the East African coast boasting quiet beaches and idyllic forests. Bantu for “Central Place,” the name Unguja Ukuu is in keeping with the extensive Asian, Middle Eastern, and European artifacts uncovered in the region. Archaeological evidence suggests that Unguja Ukuu was once a crossroads of international mercantilism, long predating Zanzibar’s neighboring Stone Town, a better-known 19th-century Swahili trading port-turned-World Heritage Site, though it’s believed that a smaller, peripheral village existed where Stone Town was built from the 11th century onward. Unearthed pottery, glassware, currency, and jewelry from India to the Roman Empire indicate that Unguja Ukuu was a notable and prosperous point on a global network of trading routes. An excavation carried out in the 1920s uncovered the ruins of a mosque, demonstrating an Islamic presence in the area, as well as Iranian coins minted in Baghdad between the late 8th and 10th centuries. A later archaeological sweep in 1966 yielded fragments of Chinese stoneware and Islamic pottery with origins somewhere between the 8th and 9th centuries. At the time, the height of Unguja Ukuu society was subsequently dated between the 8th century up until the 1500s. It wasn’t until 1991 that a deeper dig uncovered early 6th-century pottery from Egypt and the Roman Empire, revealing an even older history than anthropologists had previously accounted for. Today, Unguja Ukuu is one of the least-visited parts of Tanzania, offering pristine vistas for travelers in search of a truly undisturbed getaway.","Multiple tour companies offer private day trips to Unguja Ukuu by boat. Most tours offer transportation to and from Unguja Ukuu, lunch, and the opportunity to snorkel, sail, and explore."
28,Changuu (Prison Island),Tanzania,"Over the course of its history, this tiny island has held enslaved people in transit and served as a quarantine zone. Today, it's a giant tortoise sanctuary.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/changuu-prison-island,"Changuu Island lies just off the coast of Zanzibar, about 25 minutes from Stone Town by a small-engined boat. Though it only measures about 800 meters long and 230 meters wide, this narrow spit of land holds a lot of history. The tiny island was uninhabited until the mid-1860s, when Majid bin Salid, the first Sultan of Zanzibar, sold it to several Arab slave traders using it to hold enslaved people in transit to Stone Town or beyond. After Zanzibar and Tanzania were deemed as British protectorates in the late 19th century, the island was bought by the colonial governor with the intention of building an isolated prison, giving it the nickname “Prison Island.” After the institution’s construction, however, its facilities were only used for quarantining visitors going between Zanzibar and the mainland, mostly holding people suspected of yellow fever. Today, the island is owned by the government and acts primarily as an endangered giant tortoise sanctuary. After a 1919 gift of four tortoises to Changuu by Seychelles reproduced to more than 200 by the 1950s, the famed reptiles quickly outnumbered the human population of the island. These giant Aldabra tortoises could once be found across the Indian Ocean, but are now relegated to fewer and fewer conservation zones. The open-air sanctuary allows for supervised breeding of the tortoises and continued monitoring of the population. These massive creatures are thought to be among the longest-lived animals on earth. (But it is difficult to verify the ages of many tortoises who have outlived the scientists studying them.) Currently, the oldest tortoise on Changuu Island is estimated to be 196 years old, predating the colonial occupation of Zanzibar and Tanzania by 65 years.","Tourists to the island should expect to spend about $30-$40 for a roundtrip boat ride from Stone Town that can seat about 10 people, and bring cash to tip the sanctuary guides. It’s best to visit Changuu between June and November to avoid the rainy season, but the sanctuary is open year-round. Visitors coming from the mainland should arrange in advance to take the transit ferry from Dar Es Salaam to Zanzibar, and then take a smaller boat from Stone Town. A small resort on the island is available for those looking for a longer-term stay."
29,Akodessewa Fetish Market,"Lome, Togo",The Voodoo Superstore of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/akodessewa-fetish-market,"Deep in the heart of West Africa, Vodou (Togo); Vodoun (Benin), or more familiarly, Voodoo (Haiti) is not only alive and well, but it is thriving. Togo’s capital city of Lomé is the birthplace of the largest Voodoo market in the world – a kind of super supply store for fetishes, charms and anything else one might need for a ritual. The Akodessewa Fetish Market, or Marche des Feticheurs, is a place where you can find anything from leopard heads and human skulls to Vodou (voodoo) priests who bless and create fetishes or predict the future and make medicines to heal whatever ails you. Though many people think of Haiti as Voodoo’s biggest stronghold, the religion originated in West Africa. Vodoun is the official religion of neighboring Benin and is still the largest religion in the area, which is obvious given that the outdoor market’s location is in the heart of Togo’s capital. Although the market is owned and run by Beninese. The Akodessewa Fetish Market is a mecca to local practitioners and they travel there from all over the African continent.  Many believers view the Marche des Feticheurs as a kind of hospital or pharmacy – it is the place you go when you either cannot afford traditional treatment or traditional treatment has failed you. Here you can find talismans and charms good for treating everything from the flu or infertility to removing the blackest of curses. In the practice of Voodoo every single creature is potent and divine, whether alive or dead, and in the Akodessewa Fetish Market you may find them all – monkeys, alligators, goats, leopards, gazelles, and many, many more – in various stages of decay and stacked up in macabre piles for blocks. The outdoor location doesn’t quite suppress the stench but at least the huge market is in the open air. It is a jarring place for tourists who are not used to the idea of animal sacrifice as part of worship or using pieces of the dead as talismans, but for locals who practice the religion, it is a treasure and a necessity.","Open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Four kilometres from the centre, it can be accessed by taxi or taxi-moto. There is a fee for taking photos."
30,Nok Caves,"Tandjouare, Togo",Hidden dwellings in the cliffsides of North Togo used by local Moba tribes to evade 18th-century slave traders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nok-caves,"The Moba people in north Togo lived off the land in the Savanes region. During the 18th and 19th centuries, a neighboring ethnic group, the Tchokossi, would attack the Moba and kidnap their people to trade to European slave traders for guns and horses. The Moba took to the precarious cliffs of the area to build defensive dwellings hidden in the red rocks. Lookouts would use fire signals or the sound of cow horns to alert others that the Tchokossi were coming. They would then climb down overhanging vines to caves hidden beneath the cliffs. Within the cracks of the rock face, a mini fortress grew from large cylindrical structures filled with handmade clay jars to store grains and livestock. Nearby, springs brought water that was treated with local plants, making it possible to hide for days. The Moba used offensive tactics as well. Young warriors would attack with arrows poisoned from the same local plant used to treat the water. Legend holds that other warriors would lure the Tchokossi to their doom on the cliffs. As the Tchokossi chased the warriors on their horses, the warriors would run in the direction of the edge of the cliffs and quickly dive into nearby cracks in the rocks and the Tchokossi, unable to stop their horses quick enough, would fly right off the edge. Nok translated in Moba means “hidden” which still describes this incredible site where visitors can explore and interact with the rich, somewhat unknown history of the ethnic groups of northern Togo. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, the Nok Caves still exist today accessible by a metal ladder constructed for tourists. The structures continue to extend right out of the narrow rocks. Though most of the area was looted, arrows and quivers can still be seen amongst the broken pottery. Over 150 jars are still intact which were used to store millet and sorghum. In the middle of the area is a long, angled rock where the leaders would sit to weave tales of the bravery of their people in evading slave traders.","The caves can be accessed through the village Nagou where visitors can try the locally brewed alcoholic drink, Tchokpa. Though travelers can take a road to the plateau, it is also possible to climb up the rock face to achieve an intimate engagement with the landscape. The start of the trail is marked by a water tower near the village of Djabire at the base of the mountain."
31,Koutammakou,"Dissani, Togo",The unique building practices of the Batammariba reflect the community's deep reverence for and connection to the earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koutammakou-batammariba,"The traditional building practices of the Batammariba people are featured center stage at Koutammakou, a mountainous region bordering Togo and Benin that UNESCO calls “a living cultural landscape.” These earth-tower houses, called takienta, are a national symbol of Togo, and are steeped in a strong cultural identity once threatened by other ethnic groups. Batammariba roughly translates to “those who are the real architects of earth,” demonstrating how central the construction of these community dwellings has been to the Batammariba identity. Over the years, the takienta’s walls are reinforced by additional layers of mud and plaster, and when one is retired from use, its earthen core is incorporated into a new structure. Straw roofs usually top takienta structures, which are built to keep inhabitants and foodstuff cool under the hot Koutammakou sun. About eight takienta make up a collective sikien, a full home of dedicated structures. One takienta might be used as a kitchen, others as bedrooms, and still others as food and livestock storage. Ancestral spirits are said to inhabit these dwellings and protect their living descendants. Takienta are now mostly used for storage and worship purposes, but are still used as primary dwellings in some areas of Koutammakou. The Batammariba people have a rich animist religion that recognizes both family and tribal deities and shows great reverence to nature. These beliefs are also manifested in elements of takienta construction, like the requirement that a dwelling’s main door always face westward to represent the sunset of the winter solstice. The Batammariba people have been present in the Koutammakou region for hundreds of years, which was considered as one united area before colonial powers divided Togo and Benin through the mountains. The Togolese side is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but the Benin side has no official protection.","Visitors should plan to visit the Togolese side of the Koutammakou, and can arrange trips on their own or through tour companies. Budget 1,500 CFA per person, and 10,000 CFA for an UNESCO guide. Transport will vary on your departure and if you travel with a tour or solo, but a common route will take you to Kara from Lome, and onward to Koutammakou (a roundtrip taxi is 20,000 - 30,000 CFA for the day). Others elect to stay in tents overnight closer to the villages. You can buy souvenirs from Batammariba artisans, and should plan to visit the sacred community Baobab tree."
32,Leftover Star Wars Sets,"Tozeur, Tunisia",Buildings from the fictional planet of Tatooine still litter the Tunisian desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leftover-star-wars-sets,"While much of George Lucas’ mythic “Star Wars” films were filmed in studio lots or in preexisting structures, a number of their exterior sets, especially for the desert planet Tatooine, were purpose built for the films and simply abandoned to the sands and the fans when filming was over. While the most famous leftover Star Wars set may be the Hotel Sidi Driss, a Tunisian hotel which was used as the interior of the Lars moisture farm, Luke Skywalker’s teenage home, many more structures were built just for the production such as the Lars farm exterior and most of the city of Mos Espa. In Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace the spaceport of Mos Espa is shown as a bustling frontier town where young Anakin Skywalker lives and works as a slave. Many of the bulbous structures were filled in using CGI, but much of the first stories of the buildings were built practically and still stand as a squat beige town square that looks as though it was shaved cleanly off at the top. The facades are not actually buildings, but fronts built for filming, yet visitors can still mill about the exteriors as though they were on that far flung desert planet. There are also some iconic “moisture vaperators” also left on the site. The single-domed building that was built to represent the outside of the Lars Homestead where Luke Skywalker grew up, unaware of his cosmically significant heritage, was used originally in Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope, and then shot again for the prequel films. This little building was built in the middle of nowhere for the very first film in the series and was abandoned after shooting wrapped. Left to the elements, it deteriorated but was actually refurbished when the later prequels once again had use for it. After the prequels finished shooting the fake home was once again abandoned and began to fall apart again. However a group of dedicated fans have actually taken to restoring the hut so that it can last for future fans of the franchise. Unfortunately rampant desertification has threatened both the Mos Espa and Lars farm sets as the unstoppable desert sands are beginning to bury the science fiction meccas. The country of Tunisia has even recently sought international support to save the Mos Espa set which is a huge source of tourism revenue for the country.",
33,Hotel Sidi Driss,"Matmatat-Al-Qadimal, Tunisia","The original film set of Luke Skywalker's Tatooine home from the ""Star Wars"" trilogy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-sidi-driss,"Hotel Sidi Driss should be on the map for every hardcore “Star Wars” fan. It is the place where many of the most memorable scenes of the saga were filmed, and fans will no doubt recognize Luke Skywalker’s childhood home on the planet of Tatooine. Of course, for anyone who grew up around the Sidi Driss hotel and Berber architecture, Tatooine looks less like an alien planet and more like the old neighborhood. The hotel is situated in village of Matmâta and the whole village itself is a prime example of traditional Berber architecture such as the adobe caverns dug into the sandstone. While the exact history of the settlement is unknown, local legend claims that they date back at least to the times of Punic wars in from 264 to 146 BC. The whole region was virtually unknown to the outsiders until 1967, when severe flooding prompted locals to seek out aid from central Tunisian government. It was only 10 years later that George Lucas selected Hotel Sidi Driss as one of the locations for filming his movie A New Hope. In following years the hotel fell back in relative obscurity, and most of the decorations used in the movie were removed by the owners. In 1995 a French Star Wars fan by the name of Philip Vanni restored the frescoes in one of the rooms. The Star Wars decorations were fully restored in 2000 for filming of Attack of the Clones, one of the prequels of the original trilogy. With the popularity that Star Wars universe now enjoys it is unlikely that movie decorations will be removed anytime soon. The hotel is open all year round and offers affordable accommodation. It can accommodate the maximum of 145 guests in 20 rooms, grouped in four separate caverns. The fifth pit is a hotel restaurant.",Regular daytime service by louage (share taxi) or bus (8 daily) from Gabes (40 km).

34,Lars Homestead,"Nefta, Tunisia","The original movie set for the home of ""Star Wars"" hero Luke Skywalker.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lars-homestead,"Lars Homestead is one in a series of Tunisian relics from a galaxy far, far away. The unassuming structure is the original movie-set for the home of hero Luke Skywalker, the main protagonist in both the original Star Wars movie trilogy and later episodes of the popular series. Located just outside the town of Naftah (Nefta) in the Eastern part of the country, the small dome represents the entrance to a below-ground-level home. First constructed in 1976 when the film crew for Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope arrived in Tunisia, after serving its purpose Lars Homestead was left to decay in the middle of the desert. Just like the Star Wars movies, the saga of Lars Homestead seems to never end. In the year 2000, after decades of abandonment, the iconic home was reconstructed for the latest installment of series, Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones. After filming concluded, once again the homestead was left to the whims of this unforgiving environment. Several years later, the dome was given an unexpected new lease on life and sympathetically restored, this time by a dedicated group of international Star Wars movie enthusiasts. It’s incredible that a relatively flimsy film set from 1976 has lasted this long, especially here. After all, Lars Homestead was created to be a temporary set, and permanence was not part of the original design brief. However, although Lars Homestead may be extant, it continues to suffer from both the unrelenting Saharan climate, and due to the remote location, neglect. Unknown to many fans of the Star Wars series, the movie directors must plead guilty to deceiving the movie-goers. Most would naturally assume that both the entrance to Lars Homestead and the internal below-ground courtyard of the same house, are one structure. In reality, with the help of a little Hollywood magic, the inner courtyard of Lars Homestead was created and filmed around 160 miles away from this domed entrance, inside what is now the real-life Hotel Sidi Idris.","Lars Homestead is located in a fairly remote part of the world, in a pretty harsh environment, and it’s recommended to have a guide and/or a 4x4 vehicle. Exit the town of Naftah in the direction of Algerian border, head down the main road for about six miles (10 kilometers), and at some point of your choosing, you will need to travel off-road and into the desert (heading approximately southeast from the road). Just a little farther away, but not quite in another galaxy, is another must-see for both Star Wars buffs and Tunisia explorers in general: the abandoned space-port named Mos Espa. Bring plenty of water inside a sturdy four-wheel drive, head across the Sahara desert, and you’re there."
35,Ksar Ouled Soltane,"Tataouine, Tunisia","15th century granary, or futuristic slave quarters in Tataouine.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ksar-ouleds,"Atop a gentle, dry and sandy hill is the oval fortification of Ksar Ouled Soltane. Rounded, protected structures built completely of cracked, dry mud face the center of the castle-like granary, while steep outdoor staircases give the area the appearance of another world entirely. Ksar Ouled Soltane looks so otherworldly, George Lucas choose Southern Tunisia for filming four of the six Star Wars films. Fans will undoubtably recognize Ksar Ouled as the slave quarters where Anakin and his mother lived in the Phantom Menace. Even more surprising for fans of Lucas’ films, is that the area of Tunisia is actually called Tataouine, styled as Tatooine for the films. Before Star Wars put Ksar Ouled Soltane on the tourist map in North Africa, the windswept buildings stood in relative isolation. Constructed by Berber people, the ghorfas, or stacked grain-holding buildings have survived the hot climate since the 15th century. Although they have now been abandoned for many years, the Ksar was built for protection from raids, and designed to remain cool during arid weather near the Sahara Desert. The entire complex can be toured and explored on a visit to Tataouine, and for the nerdier of visitor, complete Star Wars tours of Southern Tunisia are offered by many locals.",Accessible from Tataouine by taxi
36,Matmata Underground Houses,"Matmatat-Al-Qadimal, Tunisia","Made famous by ""Star Wars,"" these troglodyte homes face an uncertain future.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/matmata-underground-houses,"The Berber underground homes of Matmata lie in an arid, pockmarked landscape in the parched valleys of southern Tunisia’s Djebel Dahar region. Made famous by Star Wars, these traditional structures are now threatened as residents move away to live in towns and villages. Every Star Wars fan worth their salt knows a little about the location of Luke Skywalker’s house: not Tatooine, but the actual filming location in Tunisia. Or, to be more precise, the Hotel Sidi Driss in Matmata, chosen as the set for Luke’s family home thanks to its otherworldly underground construction. But the Hotel Sidi Driss isn’t the only underground building of its type. Similar structures dot the landscape around Matmata, a pitted land of palm trees and olive groves. It’s an open question as to when nomadic tribes decided to settle here in their underground houses, and the entire area was largely unknown to the outside world until the 1960s, when severe flooding brought it to the attention of the Tunisian government. The houses themselves are built by first digging a deep circular pit into the sandstone, which is soft enough to work with simple hand tools. Caves are then dug out around the edges of the pit, forming the underground rooms and leaving the main pit as a courtyard. Once finished, the troglodyte construction offers a fine escape from the heat of the day, and a sturdy home that could survive for many years. Unless, of course, heavy rains like those of the 1960s lead to flooding, damage and in some cases the destruction of the underground dwellings. Periods of extreme drought can also damage the homes. Since the last major flooding, and despite the tourism generated by Star Wars, another threat to the homes has arisen: rural depopulation. Locals had already begun moving out of their traditional homes during the 1960s and 1970s, when President Habib Bourguiba was trying to modernize the country and many Berbers moved to the towns. More have since left, slowly trickling away with the decline of tourism. Tunisia’s tourism industry has been struggling ever since the country’s 2011 Arab Spring uprising, and was further damaged following the 2015 attacks in Tunis and Sousse, which directly targeted tourists. Some locals have remained, however, living with their families in their underground households, working their olive farms and occasionally accepting tips from tourists who want a tour of their home. And today, only a handful of men still know how to dig and maintain these special Berber dwellings.",
37,El Jem Amphitheatre,"El Jem, Tunisia","The largest and best-preserved Roman amphitheater in Africa was designed to seat 35,000 people.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-jem-amphitheatre,"The Amphitheatre of El Jem is one of the largest Roman amphitheaters ever built. Indeed (depending on how you measure it) El Jem may be considered to be the third-largest ever, after the Colosseum in Rome and the destroyed amphitheater in Capua. Designed to seat a whopping crowd of 35,000 people, today El Jem is both the largest and the best-preserved Roman amphitheater in Africa. Located in the city of El Jem (or El Djem), which was known back in Roman times as Thysdrus, El Jem Amphitheatre was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage in 1979. Hence, if you make it to the town of El Jem, you’re probably not going to miss this dramatic attraction. Although far from secret, the backstory of the construction, and the modern-day misconceptions of El Jem Ampitheatre, are little known. The precise construction date is debated, but most historians believe the building of El Jem Ampitheatre began in the year 238. Not exactly an auspicious year for the Roman Empire, 238 came to be known historically as the “Year of the Six Emperors.” In just one year, six different people were proclaimed Emperors of Rome. Locally, the year 238 was particularly tumultuous, as it included a revolt by the population of Thysdrus (El Jem), who opposed the enormous taxation amounts being levied by the Emperor Maximinius’s local procurator. As with all good taxation revolts, riots ensued, and the procurator was assassinated. However, even the assassination wasn’t enough to satisfy the locals, and they pleaded for a new ruler of the Roman Empire. Soon after the North African uprising, Goridan the First was appointed Emperor, along with Goridan the Second, his son, to co-serve as Roman leaders. Although their rule was brief—they only ruled for about 20 days—it was long enough to start the construction of the imposing amphitheater in El Jem. In more contemporary times, perhaps it’s the enormous size and uniqueness of the El Jem Amiptheatre that leads to many misattributions (on behalf of both movie fans and local guides). Some people say the Oscar-winning movie Gladiator was filmed here (it wasn’t, a fake “Colosseum” was built on the relatively nearby island nation of Malta). There are also many attributions to the Monty Python film Life of Brian being filmed at this location. But though Monty Python did film in Tunisia, they used the Roman theater in Carthage near the capital city of Tunis.","The El Jem Amphitheatre is located in the middle of the city of El Jem, and is difficult to miss. However, a nice approach is from the southeast corner, via Rue Ali Belhareth. Stop for a tea or coffee across the street, and marvel at the exterior before venturing inside."
38,Mos Espa,Tunisia,"An abandoned film set location for a remote spaceport in a galaxy far, far away hides in the Tunisian desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mos-espa-abandoned-star-wars-film-set,"Sitting in the sands that separate two salt lakes, the enormous Chott El Djerid and smaller Chott El Gharsa, Mos Espa is an abandoned film set created as the location of a remote spaceport in a galaxy far, far away. The surreal setting and dramatic otherworldly structures make Mos Espa a “must-see” if you’re a Star Wars fan. However, it’s a great visit even if you’re not a fan of the films. Being one of Star Wars’s major spaceports, Mos Epsa is shown in the movies as a town bustling with the daily life of different aliens from around the galaxy. Home to hero Anakin Skywalker from Episodes I, II, and III, we are told the location is on a remote planet known as Tatooine—named after the very real nearby Tunisian town, Tataouine. Here, Anakin and his mother live as slaves, and the foundations for all the vast storylines of the older Star Wars movies are laid. Although some of the Mos Espa townsite was added in post-production using CGI, here on the edge of the Sahara, all of the major buildings from the movies are extant. Tens of structures line the main city streets, including many “Moisture Vaporators”— in Star Wars, these devices were used to harvest atmospheric humidity and obtain much-treasured water. Currently, Mos Espa is being slowly engulfed by the sand that comes with each passing dust-storm. Over the years, the harsh Sahara climate, moving sand dunes, and a trickle of tourists have started to take their toll. Unlike the other more traditional Star Wars filming locations, Mos Espa town was built in the middle of nowhere. Although nothing here was designed for permanence, thanks to the work of enthusiasts both local and foreign, you can still walk the streets that Qui-Gon Jinn walked to meet Anakin.","Mos Espa's location is remote, and in the desert. Bring a substantial amount of water (especially during summer). The easiest way to Mos Espa is via the newly reconstructed road—leaving the town of Naftah northward, pick the road that goes slightly left, and head north all the way till you reach the end (Mos Espa will be right in front of you). There is another way, which is much more entertaining, but requires a knowledgeable guide and reliable 4x4 vehicle: go in a straight line from wherever you are, across the desert sands and dry salt-lake bed."
39,Tophet at Carthage,"Carthage, Tunisia",An ancient burial ground believed to have been used for ritual sacrifice.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tophet-at-carthage,"Tophets are at the center of one of the most contentious archaeological debates surrounding the region of northern Africa that was once part of the ancient Carthaginian Empire. The enigmatic ancient cemeteries are believed to have been used for the ritual sacrifice of children and animals. The burial site at Carthage in Tunisia, as well as others in the region, was discovered in the 20th century. It, along with the others, contained funerary urns stuffed with the cremated ashes and bone fragments of young children. Over 20,000 urns buried under stelae (stone slabs with inscriptions) were found at the tophet in Carthage, which is one of the largest cemeteries from the Phoenician period. These findings and subsequent research, which included referencing accounts in ancient texts, propelled the theory that infants were sacrificed and cremated as part of a ritual to give thanks for favors from deities, mainly the goddess Tanit and the god Baal. For many years, the rumors that the ancient Carthaginians had sacrificed their own young was considered to be propaganda spread by the Greeks and Romans, who disliked them and the wider Phoenician civilization. Over the decades, several groups of historians have debated the subject, but they have yet to reach a concrete answer. Most recently, a team led by an Oxford historian ruled there was strong evidence that ritual sacrifices did, in fact, take place. It wasn’t an isolated incident either—it happened over several centuries. Today, the tombstones and ritual altars form part of a historical site outside the capital city of Tunis, which was granted World Heritage status in 1979. The cemetery, a hybrid of a sanctuary and a necropolis, forms a striking picture. When it was at its largest, it was over 64,000 square feet and spanned nine different levels. The word “tophet” comes from a place described in Hebrew scripture, where people who were influenced by an ancient Canaanite religion burned and sacrificed children to their gods. It’s also another term for hell.","The Archeological site of Carthage is 1,600 feet (500 meters) from Carthage Salammbo Station."
40,Tunis Medina,"Tunis, Tunisia",The ancient heart of Tunis is an enormous maze of narrow streets and alleyways.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tunis-medina,"For over 1,300 years, Tunis Medina has remained bustling, but mostly unknown. Certainly, this is one of the busiest locations in the whole country. Every day, thousands of people go about their shopping, pray at one of the many mosques hidden deep within, and down strong shots of Tunisian espresso (or tiny cups of sugary mint tea). But, apart from a small handful of well-trodden lane-ways, the majority of the Tunis Medina remains mysterious and rarely visited by outsiders. Medina of Tunis (“medina” meaning “town” in Arabic) was founded during the seventh century around the site of enormous Al-Zaytuna Mosque. This is the second oldest mosque in Tunisia, constructed during the earliest days of Islam, and the Zaytuna Mosque defined the Medina area as an important cultural center, school, and university. Slowly, organically, over many centuries, the town around Zaytuna grew and expanded to become the Medina of Tunis. A UNESCO World Heritage site, and well-known due to the central location, to this day the Medina of Tunis remains genuinely a city-within-a-city. It’s not only a place for shopping and eating—it’s a neighborhood home for many residents. The internal Medina streets may be difficult to navigate, but having “outsiders” wandering through is part and parcel of living here. This is a neighborhood that’s used to living close to the action. You’re most likely to enter Tunis Medina by moving through the Place de la Victoire, an open square dotted with fountains, restaurants, cafes, and the Bab el Bhar gate (do check out the small “sea-level” marker on the side of the gate). Within moments, the “European” styled city ends abruptly, and you’re in another world filed narrow alleys, twisting, turning, and undulating, mostly covered but not always. During the day, Medina is truly a sight to behold. Thousands of shops line streets dedicated to selling specific items—jewelry street, wedding gifts street, woodworkers street, there’s even a covered alley with vendors specializing in making only chechias, burgundy-red cylindrical felt hats. In between, there’s restaurants, street-food, offices, apartments, a hotel or two, and countless paths you could take to see it all. As the sun sets, a new reality sets in. Every evening, like clockwork, most of the Medina is abandoned. It’s dark (there’s a near-total lack of lighting), and nearly impossible to navigate for anyone other than those most familiar with the layout. Most of the locals leave, or move to the wider open areas of Medina. The keen remainders catch up with friends, chat, drink coffee and tea, and smoke hookah before heading home and doing it all again the next day.","Tunis Medina is a can’t-miss place in both the literal and figurative sense. Sitting in the middle of the city, all visitors to Tunis are certain to come across the Medina soon enough. However, consider setting aside a few hours to truly explore one of the world’s oldest Medina’s. Move off the main drag, and wander through with no particular destination in mind. Indeed, it’s going to take time, and a little luck, to uncovering your unknown corner of this unique maze—but this is the true can't-miss side of the Tunis Medina. The location is given for Bab el Bhar, the ""sea gate"" that separates Tunis Medina and the European-styled central city. From there, it’s easy to spot the main entrance of the Medina—just walk on in. Keep in mind, it’s very difficult to navigate within the Median using GPS, due to the narrow and covered streets. For the best shopping and eating, visit before sunset."
41,Dougga,"Teboursouk, Tunisia",The best-preserved Roman small town in North Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dougga,"Some call it Dougga, some call it Thugga. Either way, its pristine preservation has earned it World Heritage Site status from the UNESCO. It sits on a craggy hillside, perched above fertile hills of groves in central Tunisia. Despite its status as a preserved Roman town, the settlement is actually quite a bit older than that: The discovery of dolmens (Bronze Age burial structures) within the city limits indicates a human presence since at least 2000 BCE. Though most of what remains of the city is from the Roman era, there are several significant Numidian structures, including the Punic-Libyan Mausoleum. It was during this time that the site was known as Thugga. The site owes its state of preservation to remoteness and lack of modern encroachment. Among its structures is a theater that could seat practically the entire population of the town—around 3,500. There is also a circus for chariot racing, a large villa, several baths dating from 300 CE, and two triumphal arches. The site contained a large number of elaborate mosaic floors. (Some are in situ but most are housed in the Bardo Museum in Tunis.) Most notable of all, however, are the twenty temples found, a truly disproportionate number of temples for the size of the population. At first it was thought that Dougga was a major religious site, but it has since been decided that the temples were erected by wealthy residents as tribute for their good fortune. The most famous and most photographed of these temples is the Capitol, built in the 2nd century CE. It’s dedicated to Rome’s protective triad: Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. The capitol is exceptionally well preserved, owing to its inclusion within a later Byzantine fortification. Visitors to the site can wander through the hilly, cobblestoned streets and take in the serene atmosphere. Aside from the major sites, there is an interesting group latrine (the more, the merrier!).",
42,Dar El Annabi,"Carthage, Tunisia",This museum in the famously blue neighborhood of Sidi Bou Saïd showcases a traditional Tunisian lifestyle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dar-el-annabi,"Approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Tunis, the town of Sidi Bou Saïd sits atop a cliff overlooking Carthage and the Gulf of Tunis. A residential suburbs with about 6,000 inhabitants, it is a fairly popular tourist spot in Tunisia. But unlike other destinations like the Antonine Baths or the Medina, Sidi Bou Saïd’s main attraction lies not in its history or the lively Middle Eastern atmosphere, but simply in its gorgeous appearance. Many of the houses in Sidi Bou Saïd are adorned with blue-and-white walls and doors with Islamic decorative patterns. These residences, some of which date back to the 18th century, are nestled among Mediterranean cafes, market squares, narrow alleys, and flight after flight of steps. One of the elegant houses, Dar El Annabi, has been turned into a museum where visitors can see a slice of life in Sidi Bou Saïd. Dar El Annabi  was originally built near the end of the 18th century. In the 20th century, it was redeveloped as a summer resort for Taib El Annabi, son of Mufti Mohamed Annabi. It is now a museum showing the typical Islamic architecture on the outside and the atmosphere and lifestyle of a traditional Tunisian family on the inside. Visitors can go inside and explore the private library, prayer hall, lounges, bedrooms, the Andalusian garden, and terraces that offer a view of the surrounding terraces. Since the 19th century, Sidi Bou Saïd has attracted a number of artists, musicians, writers and philosophers, including Michel Foucault, Alphonse de Lamartine, François-René de Chateaubriand, Gustave Flaubert, Andre Gide, Simone de Beauvoir, Colette, and even the infamous occultist Aleister Crowley. The history of Sidi Bou Saïd goes back to the ancient times, when the Carthaginians and Romans used the cliff to establish a watchtower. The 11th-century Almoravids used the site for the same purpose, calling it Djebel al-Manar, or “the Mountain of Fire.” A couple of centuries later, the town welcomed Sunni saint Abu Said ibn Khalef ibn Yahia Al-Tamimi Al-Baji, more commonly Sidi Bou Saïd, who taught Sufism on a nearby hill. After his death, his name was given to the settlement.","There is an entrance fee to visit the museum. In addition to being a museum, Dar El Annabi can be rented for use as an event space."

The canyon takes its name from a nearby marabout (a shrine built to honor a holy man) of the same name, although it is more commonly known as the “Star Wars Canyon.” The shady divide acted as a number of locations in Star Wars: A New Hope during scenes on the desert planet of Tatooine. The kidnapping of R2-D2 and the rescue of Luke Skywalker by Obi-Wan Kenobi were all shot at the bottom of the stony ravine. In addition to Star Wars, the location was also featured in other films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The English Patient, but most of the visitors to the site are simply looking to make a pilgrimage to a galaxy far, far away.","From Tozeur, travel east towards Chott el Jerid. Right before you reach the chott, turn left (the sign says towards ""DGHOUMES""). Continue on this road for 2.1 km, and then left on a dirt road. The canyon is at the foot of Sidi Bouhlel, just 1.6 km down this road. Sidi Bouhlel is a well-known marabout in the area. Be sure to lock your car door when you park."
44,Hotel du Lac,"Tunis, Tunisia",Some believe this abandoned Brutalist masterpiece inspired George Lucas's Sandcrawler.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-du-lac,"Envisaged and designed by the Italian architect Raffaele Contigiani, Hotel Du Lac was constructed between 1970 and 1973 for the Tunisian government during the middle of the reign of Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia’s first president. The structure is not only an icon of Tunis city, as it is well-known among lovers of Brutalist architecture around the world. With its sharp geometry and imposing inverted pyramid shape, the abandoned hotel dominates the ville nouvelle area of Tunis. A contemporary architectural icon of North Africa (with much more than a pinch of raw-concrete Brutalism), Hotel Du Lac is not just your usual 10-floor/416-room hotel. The mind-bending, uniquely cantilevered design results in a top floor that’s double the length of the ground floor. Fans of the Star Wars movie franchise will certainly find some familiarity with the silhouette of the hotel. Indeed, the first movie in the series was filmed nearby in Tunisia during 1976 (Episode IV - A New Hope). Perhaps it’s just mere coincidence that the “Sandcrawler,” a huge mobile fortress in the movie, is designed with a near-identical shape to the extraordinary Hotel Du Lac? Or, that the Sandcrawler slowly makes its way through the sandy dunes of a remote planet called “Tatooine” (while back in real life, a nearby area of Tunisia is named “Tataouine”)? Either way, fans continue to debate whether or not Hotel du Lac was actually an inspiration for the Sandcrawler design. Notably, various members of the crew who worked on the original Star Wars film in 1975 through 1976 have made contradicting statements on the matter. So, let’s put Star Wars fans aside, as lovers of all things Brutalist firmly agree that Hotel du Lac is one of the most important (and coolest) examples of the Brutalistalism anywhere on the planet. Unfortunately, Hotel du Lac fell into disrepair and closed in the year 2000. Since 2002, it’s been completely abandoned. More recently, the hotel was sold to Libyan investors. As of summer 2019, the combination of its prime central location, growing levels of tourist numbers, the enormous cost of renovation, and the need to recoup the huge investment means that Hotel du Lac seemingly faces destruction. The future may be uncertain, but Hotel du Lac remains extant, either as a symbol of a new independent Tunisia or one of the last marks of the colonial age. That’s probably up to each observer to decide for themselves.",
45,Great Mosque of Kairouan,"Kairouan, Tunisia","Founded in 670, this ancient mosque is an architectural time portal.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-mosque-of-kairouan,"As you wander the grounds of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia you are treading across over a millennia of history. The magnificent structure — the oldest Muslim place of worship in Africa, founded in the year 670 — illustrates the mixed influences of pre-Islamic, Roman, and Byzantine architecture. The city of Kairouan, Tunisia, has long been the Maghreb’s most ancient and holy city, a key gathering place for Arabo-Muslim civilization. The Great Mosque, also known as the Uqba Mosque, is at the heart of the city’s heritage. Standing at the nexus of 15 different thoroughfares, in the center of the country between the mountains and the sea, it is considered the fourth holiest site in Islam after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. The structure is part of an expansive complex, the mosque itself covering 10,800 square meters (115,660 square feet). Within, there is a prayer room with 17 naves supported by carved columns, as well as the finely decorated mihrab, a special niche indicating the direction of mecca, outfitted in marble panels and luster tiles covered in floral patterns. There is also a pool, known as the Old Cistern (Al-Majal al-Qadim), and what is said to be the oldest surviving minbar—a finely carved wooden pulpit of Asian teak. Outside, there is a decorated flagstone courtyard and towering, three-story minaret, reminiscent of Roman lighthouses. At 32 meters (104 feet), it remains one of the city’s highest structures. The mosque’s architecture reflects features of pre-Islamic and Eastern Islamic art, as well as later Roman and Byzantine influences. The design has served as a model for many other Maghreb mosques. The mosque was originally constructed by a general named Uqba ibn Nafi (also written as Sidi Okba) as a Friday Mosque (masjid-i jami` or jami`), used for communal prayers on the Muslim holy day. Though the structure built by Uqba no longer exists, the mosque we see today is sometimes still called “Mosque of Sidi Uqba” or simply, Uqba Mosque. The mosque was rebuilt at least twice in the 8th century, and then again in the 9th century, when Prince Ziyadat Allah I, the Aghlabid governor, demolished most of the existing structure and rebuilt the mosque in sturdier materials of stone, brick, and wood. The surviving version includes a dome—borrowed from Roman and Byzantine architecture—and supporting buttresses, added in the 13th century. The mosque sits between the city’s Rue de la Kasbah and the Rue el Farabi, in the historic walled district of the Medina. The holy structure is beautiful both during the day and at night, when the minaret is aglow with lights.","Opening hours are 8am-2pm Saturday-Thursday, and 8am-noon on Friday. Non-Muslims are not allowed in the prayer room, but the door is left open if you'd like to look inside."
46,Byrsa Hill,"Carthage, Tunisia","An ancient Phoenician citadel once stood at the site where Queen Dido first landed, according to legend.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/byrsa-hill,"According to Virgil’s The Aeneid, the ancient Phoenician city of Carthage was founded by the Tyrian princess Elissa, better known as Dido. After her brother, King Pygmalion, exiled her from her homeland, Dido sailed westward with her loyal vassals. She arrived at the North African coast and encamped on a hill overlooking what would become Carthage. The hill, which came to be known as Byrsa, was the site of a walled citadel that was the center of Carthage’s military power. As the story goes, after Dido arrived the local Berber chieftain came to her offering as much land as a single oxhide could cover. The clever princess cut the oxhide into tiny strips and placed them on the ground end to end, encircling the entire hill. Apocryphally, this is said to be the origin of  the name Byrsa, which sounds similar to a Greek word meaning “oxhide.” In reality, the story of Carthage is older than its association with the Hellenistic world. The city was founded around 814 B.C. in what is now Tunisia. As for the naming of Byrsa, there are theories more plausible than the version told in The Aeneid. The name may be a corruption of Phoenician barsat, which means “stronghold,” or it could be related to the Semitic word bostra (cliff) or Akkadian birtu (fortress). The citadel on Byrsa Hill dominated the city below, and was the keystone of its military and defense. During the Third Punic War (149–146 B.C.), the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus Africanus besieged the hill and defeated Carthage. For some time afterwards, the Roman Empire occupied the Byrsa citadel as the seat of proconsul of Africa. Carthage was then invaded and taken possession of by the 5th-century barbarian king Geiseric, who established the Vandal Kingdom’s capital on Byrsa Hill; the Vandals were defeated a century later by the Byzantine emperor Justinian. In 1884, Saint Louis Cathedral was constructed atop the ruins of an ancient temple dedicated to Eshmun, the Punic god of healing, on the peak of Byrsa Hill. A Roman Catholic church built in Byzantine-Moorish style, its usage as a place of worship was discontinued in 1964. Today it is known as the Acropolium, where public events and concerts of traditional Tunisian music are held from time to time. The Carthage National Museum, which was founded in 1875, is also located on top of Byrsa Hill. It is home to a large collection of Punic and Roman artifacts from Carthage’s bygone days.",
47,Chott el Djerid,"Tozeur, Tunisia",The largest salt lake in the Sahara is mysteriously alluring.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chott-el-djerid,"Chott el Djerid (also known as Chott El-Jerid, and several other variations of spelling) is a great salt lake located in the Tunisian part of the Sahara desert. It’s known to be the largest salt lake in the Sahara, and depending on your sources, it’s also the largest salt lake on the African continent. With a surface area of more than 2,700 square miles, Chott el Djerid is over 1.5 times larger than the Great Salt Lake of Utah. The name of this lake consists of two parts: in Northern Africa, chott describes a lake that dries out in summer and usually has at least some water in it in colder seasons; el djerid is an Arabic word meaning “palm leaf” (the nearby el Djerid region in South Western Tunisia  holds 15 times more date palm trees than its human population). Chott el Djerid is (mostly) an enormous plain with a harsh desert climate and almost total lack of natural resources—including fresh water. It’s a difficult place to live, but traveling though is a different story. The barrenness could be safely described as mysteriously alluring, even beautiful. Driving across the main road that runs from the southern rim to point north-west, it’s impossible not to stop and admire the rainbow-colored salt deposits and small lakes that have water even in the driest summer days. Unexpectedly, the salty water varies in color from light green to gentle pink and vibrant orange. At the end of the lake, you will end up at a location holding many date palm oases. Chott el Djerid is situated near to the city of Douz, dubbed the “gateway to the Sahara.” A naturally spectacular back-drop, the salt lake has been used (alongside with the surrounding canyons and dunes) as a filming location for a range of movies. The Lars Family Homestead from the Star Wars series is located on the northwestern tip of the lake, right next to the town of Nafta, and Mos Espa from the same movie saga is less than 10 miles north from there. Very much pre-dating modern film-lore, Chott el Djerid is considered to be the most viable candidate for the ancient lake Tritonis mentioned in Greek mythology. Tritonis is the birthplace of the goddess named Athena, and somewhat ironically, the name Tritonis was given after another Greek god, Triton, known as the Greek god of the sea.","As Chott el Djerid is an enormous salt lake in the middle of an extremely unforgiving desert, navigating through it should be approached with some care. Make sure you have a full tank of gas, and bring more than enough drinking water with you. Going off-road here is dangerous at any time of the year, as even the hardiest four-wheel-drive vehicles may get stuck. Best to stick to the P16 road going between Douz and Tozeur, or C103 if you’re headed to or from Gafsa. Even better, look into a local guide who knows the place well."
48,Monument to Mohamed Bouazizi,"Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia",A tribute to the man who lit himself on fire and ushered in the Tunisian Revolution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-mohamed-bouazizi,"On the main stretch of road running through Sidi Bouzid, a dusty interior town in Tunisia, sits an unusual statue: a concrete handcart, with an overlarge silhouette in panels across the facade of the building just behind it. The face on the building is both indistinct — derived from a small, blurry scrap of a photo, but also the only one the man’s family had left. It’s Mohamed Bouazizi, a young man who, on December 17, 2010, lit himself on fire, sparking the Tunisian revolution and what would later become the Arab Spring. Bouazizi was living on the economic margins in 2010, like many of his fellow Tunisians. The country was languishing under dictator Zine el Abedin Ben Ali, who not only controlled speech and expression, but also held an iron grip on the business sector, funneling jobs and contracts to a corrupt circle close to his presidency. Bouazizi, the eldest son of a widowed mother, didn’t even have the right connections to get a stall in the Central Market of his town to sell fruits and vegetables. He built his own handcart instead and sold his wares on a busy street corner along the main drag. He often faced harassment from the police and paid bribes to stay in business. But on December 17, 2010, a policewoman stopped him, and, instead of taking his fruit as a fine, took his scales — the one thing he needed to do business. An argument ensued, and then, she slapped Bouazizi. He was humiliated, and furious. He went to the police station across the street to hold the policewoman responsible and get his scales back. They sent him away and so did the receptionist at the mayor’s office. He finally went to the governor’s office, which was across the street from his cart. The guards wouldn’t allow him to enter. In a fit of desperation and anger, Bouazizi poured lighter fluid all over himself and then flicked the wheel of his lighter. He wouldn’t survive to see what his desperate action started—protests that grew from the interior to the coast and in 28 days, led to the ousting of Ben Ali after 23 years of dictatorship. The monument in Sidi Bouzid was hastily built and is already deteriorating a bit, primarily because it has become the rallying point for any kind of political activity in the town. People often climb atop it to address crowds, and the cart is starting to wear down. But if you find yourself in this corner of Tunisia, take a moment to stand at this monument and look up at the hazy face of the young man who reshaped his country and the world.","The monument is spread across the block just past the main roundabout in the town when you are heading southwest. The Walea, the municipal building where Bouazizi set himself on fire, is the pink building on the right-hand side of the street as you're moving through the town from Kairouan."
49,Aghlabid Basins,"Kairouan, Tunisia",This grand hydraulic installation has provided water for townspeople since the Middle Ages.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aghlabid-basins,"The ancient town of Kairouan, Tunisia is located within a semi-arid region, prone to drought, without any nearby rivers or natural water sources. Water supply and storage has been a problem for more than a thousand years. The solution took the form of the majestic Aghlabid Basins, a huge and highly advanced work of engineering during the Middle Ages. The hydraulic ensemble, built in the 9th century by the Aghlabid Dynasty, has provided water for townspeople in Kairouan for more than a millennium. The Aghlabid Basins are composed of two connected cisterns which together form an open-air reservoir, fed by a 36-mile aqueduct that sources water from the hills beyond town. Water flowed into the smaller pool, which serves as a sort of filter, collecting stray sediments before the water is transferred to the larger basin, which is an impressive 16 feet deep and 420 feet in diameter. The basins would fill up with rainwater, which would be used for washing or for emergency hydration, though contamination always posed a major risk. Still, the system is remarkably sophisticated engineering feat for its time, and considered the largest hydraulic installation of the Middle Ages. Originally, there were 16 of these pools, though just the two remain today. Though the pools appear circular, they are in fact 17-sided polygons. The basins are named for the the Arab-Muslim dynasty for which Kairouan served as the capital city: The Aghlabids ruled the region known as Ifrīqīyah (Tunisia and eastern Algeria) from 800 to 909. The basins were built under the instruction of Prince Abū Ibrāhim Aḥmad, one of the 11 Aghlabid emirs, who was known for commissioning many public works—water works being perhaps the most crucial among them. Today, if you are in Kairouan, you can visit the now completely excavated basins. The area has been established for visitors, though the water is still not recommended for drinking.",
