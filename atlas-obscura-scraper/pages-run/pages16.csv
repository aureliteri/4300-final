0,Kaindy Lake,"Saty, Kazakhstan",Submerged trees jut ghost-like out of an idyllic turquoise mountain lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaindy-lake,"Kaindy Lake is an idyllic mountain lake in Kazakhstan’s portion of the Tian Shan Mountains, close to the country’s largest city, Almaty. The lake was formed after an earthquake in 1911, which caused a major landslide, effectively creating a natural dam. Successively, rainwater filled the valley and created the lake. The lake is famous for the number of dead and bleached spruce trees that stick out of the water – remnants of the trees that were flooded when the lake was formed. The trees, together with the improbable turquoise water of the lake, make an incredibly scenic sight. Underwater, the imagery is even more stunning, as the trees have not decomposed and create the surreal vision of an underwater forest. Surprisingly, the lake sees few visitors, partly because Kaindy Lake is overshadowed by the more famous Bolshoe Almatinskoe Lake and the Kolsay Lakes, all of which are close by, but far easier to reach from Almaty. Thus, despite its proximity to a city with a population of more than one million, the lake retains a peaceful atmosphere.","This lake is located in the canyon to the east of the Kolsay Lakes. Drive up to Zhalanash, the Regional Center, to the east of Almaty (turn to the right off the Narynkol highway just before reaching the Charyn River). Head from Zhalanash up to the Saty settlement in the west. This settlement is located 320km from Almaty. Turn left on the dirt road one kilometer before the village, by a cemetery. This road brings you up to the lake, but only a vehicle built for rougher terrain will make it. The lake is located in forested country."
1,The Last Wild Apple Forests,"Almaty, Kazakhstan","Granny Smiths and Fujis can both be traced back to Kazakhstan, where apples still grow wild.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-wild-apple-forests-almaty-kazakhstan,"It might seem strange to think that the common apple was not originally a universal fruit, but in fact it has its roots in one specific region of the world. The ancestor of the domestic apple is the Malus sieversii, which grows wild in the Tian Shan mountains of Kazakhstan. In the early 20th century, biologist Nikolai Vavilov first traced the apple genome back to a grove near Almaty, a small town whose wild apples are nearly indistinguishable from the Golden Deliciouses found at grocery stores today. Vavilov visited Almaty and was astounded to find apple trees growing wild, densely entangled and unevenly spaced, a phenomenon found nowhere else in the world. Scientists believe the Tian Shan apple seeds were first transported out of Kazakhstan by birds and bears long before humans ever cultivated them. By the time humans did begin to grow and trade apples, the Malus sieversii had already taken root in Syria. The Romans discovered it there, and dispersed the fruit even further around the world. When modern genome sequencing projects affirmatively linked domestic apples to Malus sieversii, Almaty and its surrounding land were officially recognized as the origin of all apples. Almaty’s former name, Alma-Ata,  means “father of apples,” and the town touts its heritage proudly. A fountain in the center of town is apple-shaped, and vendors come out each week to sell their many varieties of domesticated apples at market. Apples weren’t always a precious fruit in Almaty though. They used to be commonplace, and during Soviet development many of the trees were cut down for their wood. Up to 80 percent of the wild apple forests were destroyed. Today, reserves throughout the Tian Shan mountain range keep the last wild apple forests growing safely—except from foraging bears, who don’t care at all about botanical history. Pomologists report that the wild apples have a variety of flavors, depending on how the bees pollinate the blossoms. There are honey- and berry-flavored apples, sour crabapples, apples that taste like licorice, and a few strains that would be good enough for a supermarket’s produce section.","The apple forests only exist in patches along the Tian Shan mountain range now. There are various protected sections in the Ile-Alatau National Park, but hiring a guide to take you there is recommended as they are difficult to find."
2,Aral Sea,"Aralsk, Kazakhstan",Rusting ships sit in a desert where a sea used to be.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aral-sea,"A man made environmental disaster has left a once-great sea dry, the land polluted, and the locals inundated with disease. The destruction of the Aral Sea is a strange legacy of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union sought to increase its production of cotton. The decision was made in 1960 to irrigate land in the recently assimilated central Asian countries and develop their own cotton industry. At the time, the Aral Sea was the world’s fourth largest inland sea. By 1937, the area had successfully become a major exporter of cotton with little impact on the natural environment. But starting in the 1950s, aggressive Soviet irrigation projects stemming from the Aral Sea started to have an adverse impact. Between 1960 and 1980, the water level dropped by 20 meters, exposing sea beds, and increasing the salinity levels of the lake until the fish population died off. Today, the sea is nearly dry and has separated into two much smaller seas. Fishing boats sit aground, rusting in a vast contaminated desert wasteland. To make what is an already horrific situation worse, on the island of Vozrozhdeniye, in the center of the former Aral Sea are the remains of the Soviet Union’s extensive bio-warfare experimentation. Experiments with anthrax, plague and smallpox were conducted here in open air tests in the 1950s. The base was hastily abandoned in the 1990s following the breakup of the Soviet Union, the canisters of disease agents buried, and the land coated with bleach. In the years since the abandonment, the island has slowly become part of the mainland. A US anti-terrorist team visited the remains of the island in 2001, in theory to clean up any remaining bio-warfare agents, but a visit by author Nick Middleton in 2005 showed signs that there is still plenty to be worried about. He found the island crawling with local looters, disturbing old buildings, and wearing no protection. Test tubes and feeding troughs for test animals were still in place. Although some diseases like smallpox can be virtually eliminated by exposure to UV over time, the same can not be said for Anthrax which has a very long and stubborn lifespan, and once inhaled, has a mortality rate of 90%. The local population suffers from abnormally high cancer rates, tuberculosis, and anemia, made worse by the poverty caused from the death of the formerly lucrative local fishing industry. The causes for the diseases are being traced back to the pesticides used on the cotton crops to the south. In 2000, UNESCO developed a rescue plan for the area which attempts to reclaim water for the sea by 2025, but it is regarded as unrealistic by many. The people with most ability to directly impact this is the government of Uzbekistan, where the cotton fields are, but they are reluctant to make any changes as their country’s delicate economy hinges on the success of the cotton crop. The World Bank funded a small dam that has protected and even raised water levels in the northern portion of the sea, but most agree that the rest could disappear completely within 15 years. The remains of the sea are remote, reachable after a day’s drive through the desert. Update November 2017: The local Mayor ordered the removal and scrapping of all rusting Aral ships; the only example now remaining is at the Aralsk Port Museum.","The old fishing town of Aralsk at the north of the Aral Sea is on the Northern Kazakhstan train line, but is difficult to get to as it is between stops, and is a 36 hour train ride from Almaty."
3,Baikonur Cosmodrome,"Baikonur, Kazakhstan","World's oldest and largest space launch facility, once a secret missile testing site.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baikonur-cosmodrome,"“Dear friends, known and unknown to me, my dear compatriots and all people of the world! Within minutes from now, a mighty Soviet rocket will boost my ship into the vastness of outer space. What I want to tell you is this. My whole life is now before me as a single breathtaking moment. I feel I can muster up my strength for successfully carrying out what is expected of me.” Those were the words of Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961, minutes before the cosmonaut lifted off in the Vostok 1 spacecraft, becoming the first human to reach outer space and enter orbit around the Earth. His journey began at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the world’s oldest and largest space launch facility, set in the desolate desert steppe of Kazakhstan. The Cosmodrome was built in the 1950s as a secret missile testing site and as the base of operations for the Soviet space program. Using the name and coordinates of the small mining town of Baikonur, about 200 miles northeast of the actual launch complex, the former Soviet Union deliberately attempted to mislead the West about the facility’s true location. No amount of obfuscation could hide the Cosmodrome from America’s famous U-2 spy planes, however. One of the high-altitude reconnaissance jets spotted the complex in the summer of 1957, around the same time that the facility was testing the first intercontinental ballistic missiles and just months before Sputnik 1, the first man-made satellite put into space, was launched from its pads. In fact, as the most active spaceport in the world, the Baikonur Cosmodrome has a long list of achievements, some of which tend to be overshadowed by Gagarin’s famed flight. And occasionally, as in the case of Sputnik 2, an accomplishment is marred by a tragic back story. Laika, a stray mutt with astronomically bad luck, was taken from the streets of Moscow to Baikonur only to undergo months of training for a certain-death mission that saw her become the first animal to reach space. It was not until 2002, over forty years after the mission, that a former Sputnik scientist finally came clean about the details of the dog’s death, which had been caused by heat exhaustion only five to seven hours after the launch. Today, the Cosmodrome is a far less secretive place, and visitors can learn about the history of the Soviet and Russian space programs at the museum in the city of Baikonur just outside the complex. And for more explosive thrills, tours offered by private companies offer the public a chance to witness the launches of manned and unmanned space missions from the Cosmodrome facilities.","The closest train stop to the Baikonur Cosmodrome is the Tyuratam station. The city's two airports, Krainiy and Yubileyniy serve only semi-regular chartered flights from Almaty and Moscow. The nearest town with scheduled service is Kzyl-Orda, which has scheduled daily flights to Almaty and Astana on Air Astana."
4,Big Almaty Lake,"Almaty, Kazakhstan",A brilliant turquoise lake in the mountains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/big-almaty-lake,"Joining the ranks of brilliant blue lakes like Kaindy Lake and Issyk Lake, is Big Almaty Lake, which is situated outside Kazakhstan’s largest city. This alpine lake’s unusual teal hue and surrounding nature make it one of the most beautifully surreal sites in the country. Big Almaty Lake is a natural reservoir perched high in the Ili Alatau mountains, more than 8,000 feet above sea level, backdropped by three peaks that rise above the canyon. The color varies depending on the time of the year, but expect the brightest and most beautiful turquoise during September and early October. The lake takes on a more milky blue hue during spring due to the melting snow. One of the things that make Big Almaty Lake unique is that it is forbidden to swim in the lake, as it is the main water source for the residents of Almaty. Pipes carry the water from the reservoir down the mountains to the city. There are several guards walking around to ensure that no one oversteps the boundaries and goes down to the lake’s shore. Hiking opportunities are in abundance at the lake, as it’s located within Ili-Alatau National Park, and the famous Big Almaty Peak is in the vicinity. Do be careful where you hike and walk, however. Many routes are closed off because they lead to the Kyrgyzstan border, which has been closed since the collapse of the Soviet Union.","The lake is located very close to the city of Almaty, and can easily be visited as a half-day trip from the city. The easiest way to get there is by taxi. The fare there and back should be around 6000 KZT. If you order a taxi on a phone app, have it wait for you if you're not planning to be there all day. It won't be that much extra. You can also have your taxi stop up or down the way on the mountain to get photos on the gorgeous drive. Another option for getting to and from Big Almaty Lake is to hitchhike, although this should be done at your own risk. Visiting the lake itself is free of charge, but you must pay a fee to enter the Ili-Alatau park at the bottom of the mountain. The fee is a little over $1 USD."
5,Issyk Lake,"Enbekshikazakh District, Kazakhstan","The lovely lake that was naturally dammed, then naturally destroyed, then unnaturally saved.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/issyk-lake,"A 20-minute drive from the town of Issyk, Kazakhstan rests a stunning lake, its turquoise-blue-green waters contrasted against the shades of the surrounding flowers and trees. But it is the lake that almost wasn’t. The lake was originally formed around 8,000 years ago when a rockslide clogged up the gorge into which the water used to flow. For thousands of years, the picturesque turquoise waters sat, relatively unknown and unremarked upon other than by locals or explorers. In the 1930s, the region around the lake finally saw some development intended to bring tourism to the lovely body of water. In the late 1950s, the USSR established the area as a park and built a hotel and restaurant inside it. Issyk Lake was placed on the Almaty-visit list and itinerary for Moscow’s elite when they came for visits. It’s rumored that Nikita Khrushchev enjoyed coming to the lake. A picture of Lenin was carved into the rocks in the park and is still present today. The burgeoning tourism industry was dealt a major blow in the 1960s when a massive mudslide wiped out much of the infrastructure that was being built, as well as the natural dam that had clogged the gorge for thousands of years. It was reported that more than a hundred people were killed in the tragedy, but officials now say the number was closer to 2,000 or 3,000 lives lost, and the lake flooded out down the gorge. The dam was eventually rebuilt in the 1990s, and the lake restored, but this new humanmade body of water ended up being almost twice as small as the previous lake. Nature tourists have since returned to the site, but many of the locals who remember the tragedy know it doesn’t look the same. This being said, the waters of Issyk Lake, while smaller, still range into all kinds of stunning blues. The town of Issyk is around a one-hour bus ride from Almaty, Kazakhstan’s most cosmopolitan city. There are some small markets, mosques, and churches to poke around while in town. From anywhere in Issyk, the snowy Tianshan Mountains can be seen posing in the distance.",
6,Bayzhansay Ghost Town,"Almaly, Kazakhstan",An abandoned Soviet-era mining town in the mountains of South Kazakhstan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bayzhansay,"These deserted stone buildings in the Karatau mountain range were once the envy of nearby Soviet towns. The abandoned mining town in South Kazakhstan was once a bustling place. With subsidized support from Moscow and highly profitable ore mining, many people came for food and clothing during the Soviet era. The shops were always full, and the miners’ salaries were much higher than in many of the surrounding areas. Polymetal ore with very high lead content was shipped from the mines about 90 miles to a plant in Shymkent. According to legend, one out of every seven bullets fired during the Great Patriotic War was cast from Bayzhansay lead. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, ore mining stopped, and the town all but emptied out. The houses where miners once lived, as well as schools, baths, and administrative buildings are almost completely destroyed now. Among the dilapidated stone buildings, there’s a mosque that gets a new coat of paint every once in awhile, and a few families live in the area during the summers. Winter would leave anyone stranded.","It takes about 3.5 hours to reach the city from Shymkent. Most of the drive is paved, but once you must turn off the main roads you will take a single-lane dirt road which follows a river, on which you can only go about 30 km/h due to conditions."
7,Zharkent Mosque,"Zharkent, Kazakhstan",This unique wooden mosque resembling a Chinese pagoda was said to be built without the use of nails.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zharkent-mosque,"Visitors could be forgiven for assuming they’d accidentally crossed the border from Kazakhstan into nearby China when they come across this unique former mosque, current museum. The Zharkent mosque dates to around 1886, not long after the town was officially settled as a far-flung outpost of Tsarist Russia. Zharkent was a small Uighur settlement prior to official Russian township status and the mosque was sponsored by a wealthy local Uighur merchant, Valiakhun Yuldashev. Yuldashev needed an architect who would comply with his demands to create a mosque and madrasa built entirely out of wood, using no nails. He chose Chinese architect Hong Pik. According to one local rumor, Hong Pik had created such astounding buildings in China that his life was threatened by customers who didn’t want anyone else to have what they had. Rather than forfeit his life or his livelihood, Hong Pik fled to Zharkent, the farthest place he could find a new customer. A competing legend claims that when Hong Pik finished his work and returned to China, he was executed for giving away Chinese architectural secrets. No one really knows what happened to the architect, but his creation still stands, built with wood from fir trees in the nearby Tien Shan mountains. The complex includes a madrassa and a mosque. According to the local tour guide, while classrooms were segregated by gender, instruction was available to both girls and boys. The mihrab (prayer niche) and original main entrance to the mosque are similar in style to Central Asian Islamic architecture found throughout Central Asia. But the minaret, mosque exterior, and minbar (pulpit) are more like  Chinese pagodas in design and decoration. Many of those decorations feature plants and flowers, contravening Muslim rules that limit depictions of living things in religious buildings. It can hold some 1,000 worshipers, with women using the top floor gallery and men on the main floor. During Soviet times, when religious observances were discouraged and even banned, the mosque was re-purposed for various uses including a store, a cinema and even stables. Eventually they turned it into a museum, which it remains today. The mosque has undergone repairs over the years to repair damage from wear and tear and several earthquakes. While it may have originally been constructed without nails, they have been added in various stages of repair and restoration. Inside the old classrooms are additional exhibits of local art and artifacts from the Kazakh and Uighur people who lived in the area before the Russians.","In the Latin alphabet Zharkent is alternately spelled Djarkent and Jarkent, and during Soviet times was renamed Panfilov, after a World War II war hero. It reverted to Zharkent in 1991. Depending on your map, you may find the town under any of these names. The museum is open most days from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. for guided tours, but hours posted on the door may reflect changes. While guided tours seem to be required, your guide may only speak Russian and/or Kazakh. The entrance fee is 300 Tenge per person, with another 500 Tenge requested if you want to take pictures inside the mosque. Although the “per person” or “per group” rules on the latter fee seem to be negotiable."
8,Valley of Balls,"Shetpe, Kazakhstan",Mysterious spherical rocks in the semi-desert of western Kazakhstan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/valley-balls-rocks,"Close to the town of Shetpe in Western Kazakhstan lies the Valley of Balls – or Torysh, as it is known in Kazakh. It consists of numerous ball-like rock formations strewn across a wide range of steppe land. The balls range in size from tiny marble-like rocks to huge boulders the size of a car. The phenomenon is poorly researched, but there could be a number of geological explanations from megaspherulites - crystalline balls formed in volcanic ash and then revealed by weathering - to cannonball concretions - a process where sediment accumulates around a harder core - to spherical weathering wherein the conditions are just right to erode rocks into spherical form. In this case due to the range of sizes the most likely explanation is that of spherulite formation. Visible from the Valley is Sherkala (Lion Rock), a stunning 332m white and ochre chalk outcrop with numerous fissures along its rim and even more rock formations at its foot. Close by are also the scant ruins of the Silk Road town Kyzylkala.",
9,Palace of Peace and Reconciliation,"Astana, Kazakhstan",Iconic pyramid from famed British architect Norman Foster designed to represent all of the world's religious faiths.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palace-of-peace-and-reconciliation,"Built between 2004 and 2006 in Kazakhstan’s capital city of Astana, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation (also known as the Palace of Peace and Accord) is one of the world’s most impressive pyramid designs - second, maybe, to the Great Pyramids of Egypt, but that’s an argument to be had between fanatics of modern architecture and ancient construction. Representing all of the world’s religious faiths, the Palace houses educational facilities, a national center for Kazakhstan’s various geographical and ethnic groups, and a 1,500-seat opera house. The diversity is represented in the design of the entire building, which clearly resembles a massive triangle, 62 meters tall with a base that is 62 meters by 62 meters square. The lower portions of the triangle are clad in pale granite while the upper portions feature stained glass featuring doves designed by Brian Clarke. Because of the extreme environment in which the pyramid sits, engineers had to design a steel and concrete skeleton that is able to withstand the expansions and contractions brought on by temperatures that vary from -40 to 40 degrees Celsius.","51.122826,71.46546"
10,Charyn Canyon,"Raiymbek District, Kazakhstan","Nicknamed Kazakhstan's Grand Canyon, this natural wonder lies east of Almaty near the Chinese border.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/charyn-canyon,"Charyn Canyon (also spelled Sharyn) is a great place for a little afternoon adventure. Nicknamed Kazakhstan’s Grand Canyon, the destination is part of a national park and the Charyn River valley, fed by the local Tianshan Mountains. There’s a gravel road running along the canyon bottom, and smaller footpaths wind up and around the many formations and columns. The sedimentary red sandstone varies in shade from deep orange to light brown, shaped by millions of years of erosion. The multicolored rock layers are the product of different stages of sediment deposits, and are often crumbly to the touch The Valley of Castles is the canyon’s most well-known spot, with particularly eye-catching structures of a bright red hue. It’s about one or two kilometers long and 100 meters in depth, and can really scorch in the summer. If you need to cool off, it’s possible to swim in the river—or even kayak, raft, or fish; the local fish is called the osman. The entire canyon is a total of about 80 kilometers (50 miles) long. Charyn Canyon sits within the Uygur District, Raiymbek District and Enbekshikazakh District of the Almaty Province. It’s about a two-hour drive from Almaty; you can take a tour bus, hire a taxi, or rent a car. It’s become more of a destination over recent years, which means weekend crowds and scattered trash. Still, you’ll need to pack your own lunch and bring a bottle or two of water, since you’ll find no food stands or convenience stores. If you find yourself hungry or thirsty, kind Kazakh tourists will likely offer to share their food with you—an interaction that might just turn out to be the best part of your visit to Charyn.",
11,Semipalatinsk Polygon,"Semey, Kazakhstan",One of the most horrible legacies of the Cold War is a site where the Soviet Union tested nuclear bombs on civilians.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/semipalatinsk-polygon,"Prior to 1990, Semipalatinsk (today known as Semey) was one of the numerous closed cities of the Soviet Union. Only high-ranking officials of the politburo knew about the going-ons within these cities. Nobody except those few with clearance were allowed to enter or leave these areas, and these closed cities did not even appear on maps or road signs. When the Cold War ended, most of these closed cities were abolished, and the secrets they concealed became known to the public. While most of these places were only strategical military locations or sensitive mining areas, some of these places truly hid incredible secrets – like the formerly closed city of Semipalatinsk. The Polygon was the primary nuclear test site of the Soviet Union. In total, 456 nuclear tests have been conducted between 1949 and 1989 at Semipalatinsk, including 340 underground and 116 atmospheric explosions. Altogether, the number of nuclear explosions at Semipalatinsk equals more than 2,500 Hiroshima bombs. A huge number of craters, partly filled with water, testify to these experiments. It was not the only nuclear test site of the Soviet Union, but it was the only one close to major settlements. The Soviet Union conducted these nuclear tests without regard to the health effects on the 200,000 residents of the Semipalatinsk area, who weren’t evacuated or warned during the actual explosions. Local residents soon became aware of what was going on, and witnessed health problems soon after the first tests. Cancer rates in the Polygon area skyrocketed and a couple of years following the first tests, a disturbingly high number of children with genetic defects were born. There was nothing the people could do about it, since they were not allowed to leave the boundary of the closed city area. Finally, in 1989, an anti-nuclear movement called “Nevada Semipalatinsk“ was formed, that forced the weak and crumbling Soviet Union to refrain from further nuclear tests and to close the site. Following the independence of Kazakhstan, the closed city status was abolished. The site may have been closed and the tests may have stopped, but the legacy of the nuclear tests lingers on. An area of more than 18,000 square kilometers is heavily contaminated and seemingly as many as 1.5 million people – a tenth of the total population of the country – have been diagnosed with health problems that can be attributed directly or indirectly to the nuclear tests. Even today, people continue to live in the Polygon area. Since this is one of the poorer regions of Kazakhstan, few people have been able to move away. Those who stayed continue to rely on contaminated local crops and water, and even dismantle structures of the Polygon to obtain scrap metal they can sell. Cancer rates, including leukemia, are still as extraordinarily high as they were decades ago, as are infertility and depression. Still, one in twenty children are born with severe birth defects – and almost none of the other nineteen are born healthy. The disturbing 2010 documentary film “After the Apocalypse“ describes the current situation of the site.",The place can be visited with a permit. Therefore you need to buy a tour of one or two days.
12,Soyuz 11 Memorial,"Zhanaarka District, Kazakhstan","The remains of a monument in the remote Kazakhstani desert dedicated to the only men to die in outer space, the crew of the Soyuz 11 rocket.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soyuz-memorial,"Located in the center of Kazakhstan, 16 miles of desert away from the nearest road, lies a giant, black monument that only a small handful of people have ever laid their eyes on. This is the Soyuz 11 Memorial. Every man who has ever lived was born on Earth — a record that it’s estimated won’t be broken until 2050. But there have been men — three, to be exact — who died far outside of Earth’s atmosphere. Of the 439 people ever sent into space, only 18 never made it back, and of these 18, only the three-man crew of the Soyuz 11 died in “outer space”, defined by the U.S. government as at least 50 miles away from the surface of the Earth. The Soyuz 11, a Russian rocket which launched in June of 1971, was the only manned mission to ever board the world’s first space station, Salyut 1. There, the crew set the world record for the longest amount of time spent in space, at 22 days, which was broken by the American “Skylab 2” two years later. Despite a fire on day 11 and the fact that the entire spaceship vibrated when the treadmill was turned on, the mission went well. That is, until it was time to go home. Just after leaving the space station, the three crew members died of asphyxiation. This was caused by a minor technical mistake when the two bolts linking the orbital module and the descent module were popped open simultaneously (as opposed to sequentially). This doubled the exerted force, rupturing the valve that automatically stabilized the spacecraft’s pressure. The pressure inside the spacecraft dropped to zero in three and a half minutes. The rocket landed in rural Kazakhstan hours later, where a rescue crew went to retrieve the bodies. According to the chair of the Russian State Commission, the crew found that the bodies of the three men were “motionless, with dark-blue patches on their faces and trails of blood from their noses and ears.” To honor their memory, at the exact location that the Soyuz 11 landed in the middle of nowhere, the Russian government built a large black monument with three sides, each engraved with the face of one of the three crew members. Constructed in 1973, it was hardly ever visited due to its remote location, but it paid due respect to those who lost their lives for the Space Race. Unfortunately, it only lasted 39 years. In 2012, a group of visitors found that the monument had been vandalized. Only metal bars and scattered ruins remain. As of 2016 a new, smaller monument has been installed reading, “the feat of the crew ‘Soyuz-11’ will always be stored in the memory of grateful descendants. Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsaev proved the possibility of a prolonged stay of man is of the earth, laying the foundation for future space projects.” Perhaps the best way for the legacy of the crew of the Soyuz 11 to live on is in the hearts and minds of all who remember their sacrifice on our continuing journey into space.",
13,Ascension Cathedral,"Almaty, Kazakhstan","In Kazakhstan, a colorful cathedral with many lives once survived the most powerful earthquake in the region.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ascension-cathedral,"The eye-catching golden domes and kaleidoscopic color scheme of the Ascension Cathedral in Almaty, Kazakhstan, draw visitors to the city’s Panfilov Park, but the building’s genius architecture and complex history demand just as much attention. After nearly 40 years of deliberations, construction of Almaty’s Ascension Cathedral began in 1904, according to architect Constantin Arkadyevich Borisoglebsky’s design. However, as Borisoglebsky had left the city in 1902, it was regional engineer Andrei Pavlovich Zenkov who made addendums to Borisoglebsky’s plans and oversaw construction. As such, it’s commonly called the Zenkov Cathedral. Construction was completed in 1907. In addition to the church’s striking beauty, the architecture and engineering command respect; at a height of 56 meters, the Ascension Cathedral is one of the tallest wooden constructions in the world. It’s widely believed that the church was built entirely without metal. However, while the vast majority of the structure is made of Tien-Shan spruce, there are a small number of nails, bolts, and other metal pieces. The church’s interior came from artistic workshops in Moscow and Kyiv, while the icons were painted by local artist and ethnographer, Nikolay Gavrilovich Khludov. The Orthodox community attended services there until 1927 when they were banned by the Soviet regime. The Cathedral was subsequently vandalized and looted. Over the ensuing decades, it served a variety of public functions, including an exhibition center, concert hall, and the first Central Museum of Kazakhstan. The Cathedral’s bell tower was also the site of Kazakhstan’s first radio transmission center, placed there in the early 1930s. Extensive renovations took place in 1976, and the cathedral was finally returned to the Orthodox church in 1995. The massive earthquake that destroyed most of the buildings in Almaty—then known as Verniy—in 1887 must have left an impression because Borisoglebsky’s design was meant to be earthquake-proof. He included what he called a “seismic basket,” fitting the building’s wooden beams with metal braces and brackets that allowed them to sway with the motion of an earthquake if another one struck, which it did in 1911, laying waste to most of the surrounding buildings. The cathedral’s survival contrasted so sharply with the surrounding ruin that local bishops called it an act of God. Zenkov’s response to that, if he had one, was not recorded, but he was certainly proud of his engineering.

This two-story green market, in business since 1875, puts most farmers’ markets to shame, with its wide array of Kazakh delights, ranging from fizzy, alcoholic milk to horse sausage. Rows of vendors sell meticulously arranged baskets of kurt, smooth balls of a dry, salty cheese made from fermented mare’s or sheep’s milk. The cheesemongers also sell kumis, a lightly alcoholic beverage made with fermented mare’s milk, which they ladle out of buckets into small soup bowls. Dried apricots, raisins, figs, and other fruit and nuts lie like little jewels on trays, next to fresh fruit being pressed on hand-cranked juicers. The smell of freshly cut flowers, spices, and produce lingers as one walks through the bazaar. From salty camel’s milk to fish roe to horseradish condiments, customers are encouraged to have a taste as they peruse the stalls. The meat selection at the bazaar is extensive, including an entire section dedicated to horsemeat. Here, beneath slabs of hanging meat, butchers prepare and sell varieties of horsemeat sausages, including shuzhuk and qazı, a spicy, garlicky sausage made from horsemeat ribs seasoned and stuffed inside a horse intestine. Sheep’s heads, considered a delicacy, are sold too. On festive occasions, koy bas, a boiled sheep’s head preparation (served cold, with a garnish of onions) is a typical accompaniment to beshbarmak, the popular Kazakh meat-and-noodles dish. The first iteration of the bazaar was built in 1875, as a stopping point for traveling merchants. Though its newer modern building bears few similarities to the original, the market still serves as a place where cultures and cuisines can mingle. Rows of vendors sell spices, nuts, and dried fruit from across Central Asia, as well as honey and fresh breads. There are even stalls selling kimchi. If you’re still hungry after the generously proffered tasting samples, stop over for tea and noodles at one of the food stalls lining the perimeter. And if you must be a tourist, embroidered Kazakh hats, jackets, and intricately woven slippers are some of the beautiful souvenirs on display.",The market is open every day except Monday. The market closes at 7 p.m.
15,Cosmonaut Grove,"Baikonur, Kazakhstan",Avenue of trees planted by cosmonauts before their space departures.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cosmonaut-grove,"In a tradition that goes back to Yuri Gagarin and the Soviet space program, each cosmonaut crew member has planted a tree before their departure at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The trees are located behind the Cosmonaut Hotel, which was designed for cosmonauts to rest before their space travels. The grove lines the Avenue of the Cosmonauts, as it’s called, and each is designated with a plaque with the crew member’s name and the year. Gagarin’s tree stands the tallest, while recent Soyuz crews have smaller saplings growing from the soil. A planting traditionally takes place the day before a voyage, although it can also be the week before, and it’s accompanied by a walk in the grove to remember the intrepid cosmonauts who came before through the trees that flourish in their absence.",
16,Khan Shatyr,"Astana, Kazakhstan",An entertainment center in a huge transparent tent.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khan-shatyr,"The new Kazakh capital city of Astana is dotted with remarkable pieces of modern architecture, of which Khan Shatyr is the crowning jewel. A huge transparent tent, 150 m high and covering 140,000 m², which has been purposefully built to give the population of Astana a relief from the harsh winter climate of Northern Kazakhstan. Khan Shatyr was designed by British architect Norman Foster, who is also responsible for the pyramidal Palace of Peace and Reconciliation – another one of Astana’s architectural marvels. Inside the huge structure of Khan Shatyr are a number of entertainment options, such as a park, a boating river, a minigolf course, a shopping centre and even an indoor beach resort. Regardless of the outside temperature extremes, the internal temperature is moderate year-round, varying between 15 and 30° C, which is achieved by the use of the infiltrated sunlight, as well as air heating and cooling systems. Khan Shatyr was unveiled by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2006 and was opened in 2010, on the 70th birthday of Nazarbayev. Almost a contained city to itself, Khan Shatyr provides a near-vacation destination in the center of Astana.","Astana, 37 Turan Ave"
17,Bayterek Tower,"Astana, Kazakhstan","A modern tower, symbolizing the legend of a golden egg on top of the tree of life.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bayterek-tower,"The Kazakh word “bayterek” translates literally to mean “tall poplar,” as in the tree. That’s what makes Bayterek Tower such a fitting name for a national monument steeped in symbolism and meaning, connecting the old world to the modern in a celebration of progress. Located in Astana, Kazakhstan, every element of Bayterek Tower was designed with the intention of imparting meaning to visitors and citizens alike, right down to the height of the tower, which stands 97 meters tall to represent 1997, the year in which Astana was named the capital of Kazakhstan. The unusual construction of the tower is more than just a unique artistic flourish. The golden sphere that rests atop the many pointed spires of the tower is meant to symbolize an egg nestled amongst tree limbs – a nod to an age-old local folktale about happiness and beginnings, focusing on a bird who laid its egg in the sacred tree of life. This combination of the old and the new is intriguing and inspiring to both Kazakhs and visitors, who are invited to travel to the top of the tower and see views of the city from an observation deck inside its golden dome. Not only does this provide a unique tourist attraction, but also yet another means of symbolism, as visitors travel inside the “egg” of happiness and beginnings, able to see the modern world from a place of history and legend.",
18,Beatles Statue of Almaty,"Almaty, Kazakhstan",Beatlemania is still going strong... at least in Kazakhstan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beatles-statue-almaty,"Bronzing items which one finds important, and well worth saving, isn’t a rare practice. Attics and closets across the world are filled with bronze baby shoes, bronze hand prints and, less commonly, the occasional bronze tail. So it makes sense that somewhere in the world there would be at least one place to find The Beatles in bronze. Luckily, this shiny piece of pop culture on the side of the well-traveled tourist locale of Kok Tobe mountain in Almaty, Kazakhstan isn’t the actual Beatles dipped in bronze (so far as anyone can tell)—just a whimsical sculpture. The youthful, cartoonish representation of the worldwide musical sensation was created in 2007 by artist Eduard Kazaryan as an homage to the popularity and universal appeal of the group, and as another piece of artistic flair to go along with the existing attractions in Kazakhstan’s largest city. The statue stands near the artistic Almaty Tower on the popular mountain, which it seems is starting to be a rallying point for artists and tourists alike due to the attractive scenic vistas and popular activities the mountain provides visitors to the area.",

Just behind the Semipalatinsk Hotel are several sculptures featuring the Soviet leader, Vladimir Lenin. There are other statues around the park of other Soviet-era figures, but none stand out more prominently than a giant statue of Lenin. The largest of all the relics, Lenin towers over the surrounding trees, a reminder of the power and magnitude of the former Soviet Union.","The statues are located directly behind the Semipalatinsk Hotel, which is next to Victory Park. Walk across the street from the park toward the hotel and walk one block. Turn right after the old-Russian-style log building, and you can see Lenin above the trees."
20,Ruins of Sauran,"Sauran, Kazakhstan","This was once the largest city in Kazakhstan, and a major stop on the Silk Road.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-of-sauran,"Located in what is now South Kazakhstan, Sauran may have been originally settled as early as the seventh century. By the 10th century it was a flourishing metropolis, described by the medieval geographer Al-Maqdisi as a “large city surrounded by seven walls.” Archeologists were puzzled when they failed to find the seven walls in these ruins, until they found another nearby site and realized that the city moved sometime in the 12th or 13th century. No one knows why the city was moved. Some believe that the original city was abandoned because of the presence of bubonic plague, likely brought from traders traveling the Silk Road. Others believe it was abandoned after it was conquered by Genghis Khan. However, it served as the capital for the Mongol White Horde through the time of Tamerlane, but it seems that as the empire declined, so did the fortunes of Sauran. By the 14th century, Sauran was undergoing a resurgence, and was rebuilt on its current site. During its heyday, the poet Wāṣefi described it in the 16th century as “cheerful and bright, with soft invigorating air” and containing “all sorts of beautiful trees.” Sauran remained a key city in Central Asia until the 18th century, when the nearby city of Turkistan, 35 kilometers (22 miles) to the southeast, began to dominate the region. The secret to Sauran’s centuries of prosperity in the desert is its extensive arrangement of underground irrigation canals. Known as a kyariz system, it used horizontal tunnels to take advantage of the natural flow from mountain aquifers and the confluence of three small rivers: Tastaksay, Aksay and Maydantal. Vertical wells were dug every 50 meters (164 feet) along the tunnels which allowed access to water and served as air vents for the slaves who dug the canals. Bellows were also used to pump fresh air underground for the diggers, who wore flotation devices made from pumpkin skins to protect against drowning during flash flooding. The city was more recognizable for what was above ground, which included two towering minarets with unique construction. Made from brick with internal spiral staircases, they were made to sway, or at least appear to sway. Early written accounts suggest they were designed to amaze visitors and enhance the reputation of the city as a center of the Islamic world. Sadly, the towers collapsed in the late 19th century. Rumors abound that J.R.R. Tolkien named the character Sauron in The Lord of the Rings after this ancient city with two towers, but in fact, “Sauron” is derived from Old Norse meaning “abominable.” Regardless, the ruins and history of Sauran stimulate the imagination as much as any fantasy story.","The ruins of Sauran should not be confused with the Village of Sauran, although they are cosily proximate.   The ruins can be easily reached from Turkistan by driving northwest along the Turkistan–Kyzylorda highway (M32) for about 46 km.  The ruins are about 12 km beyond the village and the road to them is paved."
21,Medeu,"Almaty, Kazakhstan",This Soviet-era athletic and recreation facility is the highest ice skating rink in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/medeu,"Nestled in a wooded mountain valley just outside of Almaty, Kazakhstan, Medeu is an outdoor skating rink notable not only for its breathtakingly beautiful location, but also for its distinction as the highest Olympic-sized skating rink in the world. Sitting 1,691 meters (5,548 feet) above sea level, Medeu was originally built in 1949 and serves as an illustrative example of the scope, ambition, and slightly odd superlative aims of Soviet-era construction projects. Consisting of 10,500 square meters (over 110,000 square feet) of ice, it was one of the top speed skating venues in the world from its opening in 1951 right up until the disintegration of the USSR. During that period, some 120 world records were set at Medeu. Additionally, the site served as the home rink for the Almaty bandy team Dynamo Alma-Ata, and also hosted several international bandy games. Bandy is basically hockey — in actual fact it predates hockey — played with a ball instead of a puck. In 1972, Medeu transitioned from natural ice to artificial ice, and its unique artificial ice freezing system is still in use to this day. The facility fell into disrepair after the fall of the Soviet Union, but has been revived in the past decade, being used as a centerpiece for (unsuccessful) bids by Almaty to host the Winter Olympics, and serving as center ice for bandy matches in both the 2011 Asian Winter Games and the 2012 Bandy World Championship. Visitors who are neither Olympians nor professional bandy players can nevertheless enjoy a recreational skate on Medeu’s storied ice, or take a panoramic climb to the top of the dam south of Medeu, which protects the valley from mud flows. One Medeu enthusiast states that the rink’s “unique location makes its ice superglidey,” which is a rather dubious claim (although the Wikipedia entry for the Utah Olympic Oval — elevation 4,675 feet — claims that “low air resistance” at that elevation led to the extraordinary number of records set at the 2002 Winter Olympics, so maybe there’s something to it). However, the same enthusiast goes on to say that skating at Medeu, “surrounded by mountains and fir trees, spurred on by Russian pop music: it doesn’t get any better.” Now THAT sounds right on the money.",
22,Kieli Agash (Sacred Tree) of Auliyeagash,"Auliyeagash, Kazakhstan",Local lore says this 700-year-old tree has sacred and medicinal properties.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacred-tree-of-auliyeagash,"The Zharkent area of Kazakhstan doesn’t get a lot of tourists, so if you do happen to find yourself there, locals are likely to highlight one of the most important sights in their neighborhood: the Holy Elm Tree of Auliyeagash. Auliyeagash, a village about 17 miles from Zharkent, is home to Kieli Agash, a holy tree (“Agash” means “tree” in Kazakh) rumored to be at least 700 years old. The number seven is key to the tree’s power. You may hear that the tree is 700 years old, that it sprang from seven roots, and that it takes seven people joining hands to encircle the tree. Legends about the tree abound. According to one tale, a Muslim pilgrim once went to sleep under a dead, brown tree but when he awoke, the plant was alive and green. Other stories state that water springing from the roots of the tree is healing, that a visit to the tree cures infertility, and that somehow the tree saved people from invading troops led by Genghis Khan. If you are able to ask locals about these legends, you absolutely should—just don’t expect the stories to be totally consistent. The approach to the tree is from the entrance arch, via a wooden walkway through a small park full of other, much younger, trees. Those trees are all bent over, many seemingly bending towards the main tree. Believers say this is because the smaller trees are all bowing to the older tree. Nearing the tree you will see handkerchiefs and scraps of fabric tied to branches in tribute. At the bottom of the trunk, which may be swaddled in white fabric, is a hole filled with purported holy water, which people drink either for their physical or spiritual health. The main attraction has undergone some rather severe trimming in recent years, in an effort to keep the rest of the tree alive and healthy. But even if the tree itself is a bit smaller than it once was, the park is quite peaceful and beautiful and the importance of the tree to the local community is very touching.","The village of Auliyeagash can be found by heading west from Zharkent towards Almaty and then turning right at Koktal, which takes you north towards Auliyeagash. Not far past the village you can find the entrance to the park marked with some metal railings and a small entrance arch. Colored pieces of fabric are tied to the gate, left by past pilgrims.  Frankly, even with the best directions and great GPS, this might be a little hard to find without some help from locals. Fortunately, literally everyone in the area knows about the holy tree. Work out how to pronounce Auliyeagash and, as a back up, how to say tree in Russian (“derevo”). Then find a local to ask any time you worry you’ve lost your way or just want to check that you’re still headed in the right direction."
23,ALZHIR,"Malinovka, Kazakhstan",A Stalinist prison camp for the wives and children of men accused of betraying the Soviet state is now a memorial museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alzhir,"In the midst of Kazakhstan’s steppe is a former Stalinist prison camp, where a memorial complex and museum now candidly pay respect to those who suffered at the hands of the totalitarian Soviet state—in particular, the wives of the men who were accused of betraying the motherland. Visitors to Kazakhstan’s capital city, Astana, will revel in the Vegas-like atmosphere of gleaming new buildings dominated by shimmering gold and blue glass and metal. Sightseers might marvel at the height and design of the Emerald Towers, gazing at the impossibly futuristic skyline along the way to visit the top of the iconic Baiterek Tower and take in an unlikely panorama of the Central Asian steppe. Astana also has a much darker history lurking on the fringes of the affluent power hub. In the 1930s in the town of Akmol, about 20 miles west of Astana, Joseph Stalin established a special gulag named the “Akmola Labor Camp for the Wives of the Betrayers of the Homeland,” more commonly known by its Russian acronym, ALZHIR. The camp imprisoned women and children whose only crime was to be related to a man who had been denounced by the state, often for no discernible reason. In this Kafkaesque setting, the prisoners toiled at producing clothes and materials for soldiers fighting in World War II. Summers here experience temperatures approaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit while in winter, the mercury can sag to less than 40 below, and camp conditions were hardly sufficient to accommodate the climate. Remarkably, Kazakhstan’s officials do not attempt to obscure this dismal heritage, but rather have built and promoted a museum to commemorate those who suffered and died at ALZHIR.  A historic rail transport, reconstructed guard tower, and multiple sculptures surround the uniquely designed museum, which contains numerous relics and related stories that recount the painful details of prison life.  The biographies of those who survived are a true testament to the strength of the human spirit.  Sadly, as the exhibits demonstrate, too many women’s stories ended in tragedy.",The museum is about 20 miles southwest of Astana and is largely accommodating for English only speakers.
24,Lisakovsk Pentagram,"Denisov District, Kazakhstan","An abandoned Soviet-era park that, when viewed from the air, looks like a pentagram.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lisakovsk-pentagram,"Viewed from above, this Soviet-era park appears like a satanic sign. However, the pentagram was popular symbol with the Soviets, and is an ancient symbol with many associations over time, not just those that are devilish. Yet it does seem like an eerie place, all windswept and isolated out along a peninsula into the Upper Tobol Reservoir of Kazakhstan. The nearest city is Lisakovsk, 12 miles to the east. Until 1991 with its dissolution, Kazakhstan was part of the Soviet Union and the pentagram is likely the beginnings of a summer camp, although they only ever got to the now overgrown, ominous roads that remained etched in the earth, visible on Google Earth to the curious armchair traveler on the watch for conspiracy.",
25,KarLag Memorial Museum,"Dolinka, Kazakhstan",A sober museum housed in the original administrative building of one of Stalin's largest gulags.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karlag-memorial-museum,"In the village of Dolinka, outside of the large Kazakh city of Karaganda, is the former administrative headquarters of KarLag, short for the Karaganda Corrective Labor Camp, one of Stalin’s largest gulags. The attractive architecture belies the dark history of the building, which now houses a museum memorializing the victims of political repression all over, and the Soviet gulag system particular. In its nearly three decades of operation between 1931 and 1959, the administrative center at KarLag processed as many as one million prisoners. Soviet policy was to send people convicted of crimes (real or imagined) out of their home regions where they might generate sympathy among locals. So most of the prisoners housed in KarLag were not Kazakhs. In the years of World War II and immediately after, the Soviet labor camps were filled with either prisoners of war or simply people of German and, to a lesser extent, Japanese ethnicity who were rounded up and imprisoned. Consequently, the local population of the city of Karaganda was largely ethnically German until the late 20th century. While the vast Kazakh steppe provided a prison with little need for walls or fences (you can’t escape if there’s nowhere to escape to) the main reason for situating the Karaganda Corrective Labor Camp in this district was the need for cheap labor for local coal mines. This was especially crucial during wartime. Over time the labor performed here expanded from coal mining to agriculture, railroad engineering, and various scientific work. Famous residents included aircraft designer Andrey Tuplev and scientist Alexander Chizhevsky, who were expected to continue their work within the confines of prison. The administrative building includes two floors and a basement. In the basement are recreations of rooms that did not exist in this specific building, but did exist elsewhere in the gulag system: prison cells, medical clinics, torture rooms, and barracks. In the upper floors are themed rooms featuring artifacts and dioramas that tell the stories of life in the camps. Standout features include the many Soviet propaganda posters and the small gallery of art created by prisoners. Unsurprisingly, the subjects deemed appropriate for artistic expression are limited, and feature a lot of images of Vladimir Lenin. Most of the camp’s records were deliberately or “accidentally” destroyed, but a local university continues to work on piecing together the history of the prison. A ledger is provided for visitors to add their contact information and any information they have about relatives who might have been imprisoned here. If the research team finds any information about the prisoner, they will reach out.","Budget and hour or two to see the full museum. Many of the exhibits are labeled in Russian, Kazakh, and English, but if you hire a guide you are likely to get more out of the visit as they can share additional stories and context. Tours often leave from Karaganda and include transport, admission, and a guide. If you prefer to go solo, you can negotiate with a taxi driver for round trip driving and wait time while you tour the museum. A fair price is between 5,000-10,000 tenge. Those interested in even more history of the gulag system should visit ALZhIR, just outside the capital city of Astana (now renamed Nur-Sultan)."
26,Statue of Panfilov's 28 Guardsmen,"Almaty, Kazakhstan",This Soviet statue is based on a piece of propaganda that's been elevated to national myth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/statue-of-panfilovs-28-guardsmen,"Almaty’s Panfilov Park is named for the Panfilov division, a group of World War II heroes who gave their lives in the defense of Moscow. Inside the park, there’s a memorial to fallen Soviet soldiers that’s based on that famous (if not entirely truthful) story of heroic sacrifice. At one end of a long black plinth is an eternal flame dedicated to fallen soldiers of the Russian Civil War and World War II. At the other end is a black stone memorial, with the stoic faces of soldiers from all 15 Soviet Republics. Emerging at the front of the statue is a single soldier with arms spread up and out as if in flight, one hand wielding a fist full of grenades. According to official Soviet history, on November 16, 1941, the Red Army’s 316th Rifle division took a heroic last stand on the road to Moscow. The 28 infantrymen, named the “Panfilov” division after their commander, held their ground and destroyed 18 German tanks, buying precious time for the defenders of Moscow to get into position. As the Nazis rolled closer, company political officer V.G. Klochkov called to his comrades, “Russia is a great land, but there is nowhere to retreat—Moscow is behind us!” and hurled himself under an oncoming tank with an armful of grenades. All 28 men died, the last in a military hospital, where he recounted the details of the battle before succumbing to his wounds. A journalist for the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper put the story on the front page and it took hold across the Soviet Union, inspiring patriotic songs and poems. However, the military prosecutor’s office was forced to open a special investigation after two of the martyrs were discovered to still be alive. The investigation found that the entirety of the Krasnaya Zvezda’s story had been fabricated. There had been no last stand and the dramatic quotes were invented. However, the 1948 memo was not released to the general public until 2015, and by then the story was well entrenched as a national myth. Even in the wake of the memo disproving the story, a movie based on the story came out in 2016—and the man in charge of the national archives, which released the memo, was fired. Reactions to the story are split. After the 2015 release of the document disproving the story, the minister of culture denounced the head archivist for reinterpreting history. While some deride the story’s mythological place in Russian culture, others defend it as a parable about the sacrifices of the Red Army during World War II. Regardless - the statue is a monument to the heroism of the Red Army in one of the Soviet Union’s darkest hours. The statue is located in Panfilov Park, on Gogol Street, in central Almaty. It’s close to the beautiful Ascension Cathedral and the Kazakh Museum of Folk Musical Instruments. It is easily accessible on foot or by public transport.",The statue is located east of the  Zenkov Cathedral in Panfilov Park. The public park is open 24/7. There are several other monuments and sculptures to explore within the park.

They are, after all, the gateway to the sky. But the Atyrau Airport in Kazakhstan is a bit different, as its low elevation is what sets it apart from the rest. The international airport, located 72 feet below sea level, is the lowest commercial airport in the world. It’s located on the grassy, flat stretches of land that surround the city of Atyrau. Atyrau Airport is one of five international airports in all of Kazakhstan. It’s near the Caspian Sea, which is the planet’s largest enclosed inland lake and contains a robust amount of oil beneath the seafloor. The airport plays a vital role in the local economy because it’s close to some of the country’s major sites for oil exploration. An oil company called KazMunayGas primarily uses the airport, though it still serves commercial traffic. The city of Atyrau is home to a high density of oil and construction companies.

28,Balbals of Oskemen,"Ust'-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan",Stelae-eyed stones greet visitors to a corner of Kirov Park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balbals-of-oskemen,"The vast Eurasian steppe is peppered with collections of anthropomorphic stone memorials to ancestors, and some prime examples are tucked next to the Regional Museum of History and Folklore in Oskemen, Kazakhstan. These stone stelae carved with human faces, called balbals, have been produced since the Bronze Age, dating back some 5,000 years. They were used, in various forms, by many cultures including Scythian, Turkic, Mongolian, and Kazakh. Those found in Kazakhstan are not necessarily associated with burial sites (unlike the similar kurgan stelae), and although they are typically found facing westward, they have been discovered in a variety of contexts, presumably as symbols of veneration. The style of balbals altered with time and gradually became more detailed in the depiction of human faces and sartorial accoutrement, although their precise purpose remains a mystery. Scholars believe they may honor tribal leaders, lead the deceased to the upper world, or depict vanquished enemies. Some Kazakhstan locals believe the balbals have magical properties and still leave offerings for them. With the rise of Islam in Central Asia, the creation of balbals declined, as the religion has proscriptions against human representations. But examples still abound, projecting Kazakhstan’s ancient origins with stony silence.",The Regional Museum of History and Folklore is located within Kirov Park in the city of Oskemen (or Ust-Kamenogorsk in Russian).
29,Filles Dansantes,"Ridder, Kazakhstan",A statue of traditional Kazakh dancers adds some beauty to this Soviet-era mining city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/filles-dansantes,"Driving into the remote city of Ridder, it is easy to be distracted from the beautiful surrounding scenery of the Altai Mountains by the prolific decaying detritus from the city’s industrial history. But as the Soviet-era mining influences fade, public works of art, like the Filles Dansantes (Dancing Girls), mark a gradual rebirth. This statue depicting three traditional dancers represents the essentials of Kazakh culture. They wear traditional dress including the distinctive saukele, tall hats with a name that translates to “sunny head.” They caper beneath a shanyrak, an iconic national Kazakh symbol. The shanyrak is the cross-section found at the top of yurts (the traditional Kazakh dwelling) and represents family, home, strength, and well being. The three dancers pay homage to Kazakh numerology, in which three indicates completeness and engenders a host of respected trinities including the Three Virtues, Three Kinds of Happiness, and Three Inescapable Truths. The sculpture is also a reminder that traditional Kazakh dance has experienced a resurgence since independence in 1991. The Kara Zhorga (“black horse”) dance in particular has become popular. Although originally a dance for men that derived many movements from the art of riding horses, and deliberately employed farcical gyrations, women often perform this dance, but with distinctly more elegant choreography. The statue’s grace belies Ridder’s rougher founding by a Russian-German military officer in 1786. When Philip Ridder stumbled upon rich mineral deposits, the new settlement was named “Riddersky Pit.” World famous for its metallurgy in the 19th century, the city was rebranded by the Soviets as Leninogorsk in 1941. Mining interests plumbed the nearby depths for lead, which was found in such abundance that more than 50 percent of the USSR’s supply came from Leninogorsk. Today, zinc rather than lead galvanizes the city’s economy. The city was renamed Ridder in 2002, and a short distance from Filles Dansantes is another monument with a lump of ore sitting atop a plinth bearing Philip Ridder’s likeness in honor of this event.","Driving into Ridder is perhaps the best way to reach this city, located approximately 70 kilometers from the Russian frontier. Isolated as it may seem, it is the terminus of the E40, Europe’s longest motorway route."
30,Ust-Kamenogorsk Lock,"Ust'-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan",Tucked away along a riverbend in an area known for its uranium mines is one of the world's tallest locks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ustkamenogorsk-lock,"An enormous dam may disrupt the river, but it doesn’t stop boats from sticking to their course. The world’s tallest regularly working lock sends vessels plunging 131 feet downward, letting them complete their journeys. Ust-Kamenogorsk (Oskemen in Kazakh), capital city of East Kazakhstan, lies at the confluence of the Irtysh and Ulba rivers in a region that borders Russia, Mongolia, and China. An industrious mining city, it’s known for being the Soviet Union’s primary ammunition production site and for its significant uranium output. The more than 300,000 people who live in the area, along with massive industrial enterprises, rely on power generated from a hydroelectric station on the Irtysh that’s home to the world’s tallest regularly used lock. Carrying voyagers around the power plant, the lock drops an impressive 131 feet. Keen observers will note the Three Gorges Dam in China has a lock with the same height; however, whereas Ust-Kamenogorsk regularly uses its lock, the Three Gorges only employs its lock in extreme circumstances, giving Ust-Kamenogorsk preeminence in the record books. The facility gained worldwide notoriety when Georgy Malenkov, temporary successor to Joseph Stalin as head of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party, arrived to take over management of the dam. This followed his exile to Kazakhstan by Nikita Khrushchev, who was irked by Malenkov’s attempted coup in 1957. In 1994, following Kazakhstan’s independence in 1991, the United States military conducted Project Sapphire here to liberate more than 1,300 pounds of enriched uranium after Kazakhstan volunteered to give up its nuclear stockpile. Tourists looking for souvenirs may prefer to seek out samples of the local honey, the famous regional delicacy, which does not require a military convoy to take home.","The lock and hydroelectric dam are not equipped for visitors, and although it can be easily reached along the Ostrovskogo Road, there are no facilities for parking or other conveniences. Locals can be seen crossing the property over concrete barriers and through holes in fences to gain access to dachas on the opposite side, and no one seems bothered by the occasional curious sightseer wandering about."
31,Stronger Than Death Monument,"Semey, Kazakhstan",This 100-foot tall tombstone memorializes victims of 40 years of nuclear testing in Kazakhstan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stronger-than-death-monument,"Designed by Shota Valikhanov and erected on an island in the Irtysh River 2002, the “Stronger than Death” monument recalls Kazakhstan’s history as the fourth largest nuclear power by capacity and its leaders’ astonishing willingness to eventually give up that massive power. From 1949 to 1989, nearly 500 nuclear tests were conducted at the Semey site known as “The Polygon,” but following independence in 1991, the first President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, decided to end the nation’s nuclear programs by signing the START I treaty.  Unfortunately, the fallout from such extensive testing continues to this day as attested by this giant monument. The terror of the monument’s mushroom cloud silhouette is punctuated by the marble centerpiece of a mother protecting her child while overhead, a giant atomic model hangs like a sword of Damocles. The true number of nuclear testing victims can never be known since elevated radiation has been recorded throughout Kazakhstan and its neighbors, but at least one million people in the Semipalatinsk region have been affected. The tragedy of Kazakhstan’s nuclear history is perhaps mitigated somewhat by its advocacy for nuclear disarmament. The first major anti-testing campaign, known as Nevada Semipalatinsk, was popularly organized in 1989 and led directly to the shutdown on the Polygon. Nazarbayev followed this with the establishment of the ATOM project (“Abolish Testing Our Mission”) in 2012, which organized an international coalition to combat nuclear proliferation. Today, the honorary ambassador for this program is Karipbek Kuyukov, an award-winning Kazakh painter born without arms as a result of exposure to radiation from the Semey site.",
32,Tash Rabat,"At-Bashi District, Kyrgyzstan",Extremely isolated Silk Road caravanserai in the middle of nowhere.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tash-rabat,"Today, we picture the caravans traveling along the Silk Road from China to the Middle East as a rather romantic image. This romanticized portrayal conceals the real dangers that the journey included, since the Silk Road crossed some of the most inhospitable regions imaginable, and many travelers died en route. Unlike its name suggests, the Silk Road was not a single route, but a connection of several established tracks, each with its own fair share of threats. Caravanserais were an extensive network of traveler’s inns along old caravan roads, either located at cities along the way or as outposts of civilization in isolated regions, providing shelter from the hostile natural environment and from bandits. Travelers who reached Tash Rabat have already crossed the dangerous Torugart Pass, giving them the chance to recharge their energy for the next leg of the journey through the Tian Shan Mountains, to pray for a safe passage and to restock on food and water. Some historians argue that Tash Rabat may have been a Christian or Buddhist monastery before it was turned into a caravanserai, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The legend says that it was built by father and son. As they were building cupola on the roof, the son heard a caravan coming from afar. The father asked him to stay so they could finish the work. But the son went to greet the caravan and fell in love with traveling girl. He left his father, who was so sad that he didn’t finish the cupola and left few holes in it. Inside the caravanserai there is little to experience except wandering aimlessly through the dark corridors which are lit only by small openings in the roofs. These damp corridors and rooms, which include a well, a dungeon and a mosque, are extremely atmospheric, especially since it is not unlikely that the few visitors to the site may have the place entirely to themselves. Silk Road caravanserais can still be found all along the former Silk Road from Central China to the Mediterranean Coast. What makes Tash Rabat stand out among the myriad of caravanserais, is its isolated location in a meditative landscape, which gives a good sense about how difficult and dangerous travel along the remote parts of the Silk Road must have been. Even today, with modern 4WD vehicles and navigation systems, venturing out here is anything but straightforward. Snow blocks the road, which connects it with the nearest settlement, At-Bashy, for up to eight months a year. Even without snow blocking the road, constant landslides and avalanches, not to mention regular earthquakes and floodings often turn the road into a mere suggestion. Therefore, the road leading to Tash Rabat should under no circumstances be tackled without a local driver. Altitude sickness is another threat, which should not be taken lightly, since the caravanserai is located at a height of 3,500 meters. If a sudden change in road conditions make a return journey impossible, yurt camps in the vicinity of Tash Rabat can provide shelter. To the East, the road continues to the Torugart Pass border post with China, one of the most notoriously unpredictable borders in Asia, which is reputedly more often closed than it is opened, and where crossing the border can include several days of wait.",
33,Muzey Sulayman Too,"Osh, Kyrgyzstan",An outstanding piece of retro Sci-Fi architecture built into a sacred mountain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/muzey-sulayman-too,"With a bonnet-like facade protruding from the face of a cliff along a sacred mountain, this location would have been the perfect setting for a Bond villain, if Soviet movie makers had made the Russian equivalent of Bond movies, or perhaps a settlement on a newly discovered planet in the Star Trek series. Muzey Sulayman Too (also spelled Sulaiman-Too) is housed within a combination of natural and human-made caves that accommodate a total of 13 exhibition rooms. The museum is unique in that the building is just as—if not more—interesting than the exhibits in it. On display are a mismatch of natural and archaeological items, along with a handful of religious artifacts that border on new-age spirituality. Ancient pots, a modern statue of the Buddha, stuffed animals, plastic figures of a prehistoric human, black and white pictures from the Soviet era, and a chamber for spiritual healing sit incongruously (yet intriguingly) side by side. An overwhelming number of plastic chandeliers light the way for the visitors. Muzey Sulayman Too is actually the most recent evolution of this location, which was first used in 1949 to house the Museum of Local Lore. The museum in its current form opened in 2004, but the building as can be seen today was completed in 1978 to celebrate Osh’s 3,000th anniversary.",The museum is open from 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The museum offers great views of the city.
34,Dungan Family Restaurant,"Yrdyk, Kyrgyzstan","On the shores of Kyrgyzstan's Issyk-Kul Lake, a family cooks a feast that tells the sad tale of a people's exile.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dungan-family-restaurant,"In the small village of Yrdyk in the far east of Kyrgyzstan, a Dungan family prepares a traditional Dungan Feast in their home restaurant for inquisitive travelers who not only enjoy good food, but a good history lesson, too. In the late 19th century, thousands of Chinese-Muslims fled across the Tien Shan Mountains to Central Asia after their failed rebellion against the ruling Qing Dynasty led to their exile. The arduous journey brought many to Karakol, then a wild frontier town of the Russian czar’s vast empire. Their descendants would become known as Dungans—“the people from the east”—and their cooking would become legendary. The mass exodus would leave the Dungan people in a state of permanent exile, but while they might have lost their homes, they never forgot their culinary traditions. Mamieva Hamida, the mother and head chef leads the preparation of Dungan dishes in her family home in Yrdyk, a center of Dungan culture on the outskirts of Karakol. She even shows guests how to prepare the most popular Dungan dish, ashlan fu. This cold-yet-spicy and revitalizing noodle soup survived war, exile, and the repression of the Soviet era to become a firm favorite in Kyrgyzstan. But before delving into the culinary world of the Dungans, guests are first taken to the local history museum in Yrdyk. Here they learn from enthusiastic amateur historians and storytellers the legends and myths of the Dungan people, and the dramatic story of their exile from China to Kyrgyzstan. The family then serves up a feast for their hungry guests in their living room. A long table is set in the middle of the wide room, and the smell of home cooking wafts through from the adjacent kitchen. Chopsticks are placed alongside knives, forks, and spoons, as a family member pours out steaming hot tea as the food begins to be served. A Dungan Feast comprises at least eight different dishes, and it’s a delectable fusion of cuisines. There are Central Asian–style manti dumplings, Chinese-inspired sweet-and-sour dishes, and bowls of pelmeni that would be more at home in a Russian canteen than in a Dungan family home. The fusion of all these flavors, spices, and styles demonstrates more than anything the tale of Dungan exile from China, and the establishment and integration of their communities in Central Asia.","The Dungan Family Restaurant of Mamieva Hamida is located in the village of Yrdyk, a short drive from the city of Karakol. It's right around the corner from the village history museum. If you're hungry for history and Dungan food, then you'll need to book a spot in advance through the local tourism office."
35,Monument to Yuri Gagarin,"Barskoon, Kyrgyzstan",A boulder carved into the shape of the cosmonaut's head.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-yuri-gagarin,"On the south shores of lake Issyk-Kul in Barskoon, in the northeastern corner of Kyrgyzstan, is a giant face carved directly into a massive rock. Specifically, it is the giant head of cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. While the giant face of the first man to journey into outer space, complete with cosmonaut helmet, is carved directly from solid rock, the story behind its creation is less certain. It seems that Yuri visited the area just shortly after his historic spaceflight. He may have even stood on this very rock. At which point, everyone was so psyched about the whole first man in space thing, the boulder was promptly carved into his likeness. Later, in a meta tribute to the first monument, a second more standard bust was erected. A local rumor has an more whimsical version of the rock’s origin. The rumor says that this was in fact where Yuri touched down, a fact which was covered up by the USSR because it was nowhere near the intended landing spot. While almost certainly untrue (Yuri did eject from his capsule landing near the village of Smelovka, in the Ternovsky District) it makes for a wonderful origin story.","While unconfirmed this may in fact be a recreation of the first big Yuri rock head, which is said to have been broken up and smeared with concrete after the fall of the Soviet Union. This newer restoration is said to have been paid for by Moscow.The monument can be found driving up the gorge from Barskoon into the mountains."
36,National Museum of Kyrgyzstan,"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan","Time capsule of a museum, in which the Soviet Union remains alive and kicking.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-museum-kyrgyzstan,"Kyrgyzstan’s National Museum harbors numerous interesting exhibitions, ranging from excavation finds to fascinating ethnographical collections, partly housed in dusty cabinets. But for the few Western visitors that make it to Bishkek, the real draw is the weird Soviet memorabilia. Lenin is omnipresent in the shrine-like room of the Kyrgyz Soviet Revolution on the upper floor, where his conterfeit – alongside Mikhail Frunze, Kyrgyzstan’s own leading communist – can be seen on porcelain vases and on traditional Kyrgyz rugs. Soviet flags adorn the ceiling and the walls of the hall, and the Hammer and Sickle symbol can be found anywhere. Then there are the highly bizarre murals – rather unusual depictions of Soviet propaganda, since they were not created during the heyday of Soviet propaganda displays, but only shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The style is unique, since it forms a transition from typical Soviet propaganda to modern art. Arguably, the most grotesque mural depicts former US President Ronald Reagan, riding Dr. Strangelove-style on a Pershing, wearing a mask of a grinning skull, while being surrounded by people demanding “No more Hiroshimas“. Additional bronze murals depict key events in communist and Soviet history, among others, Marx and Engels speaking to the people, Lenin inspiring the masses, the October Revolution and the burning tsarist palaces. Sooner or later, the Soviet pieces will likely be removed from the museum, but for now they still remain in place. Update February 2021: The museum is currently being renovated and is closed to the public. The murals have been removed.","As of November 2015, the museum is undergoing a renovation, which may very well include painting over these amazing murals. No amount of begging or attempted bribery will gain one access. A giant Lenin statue dwells behind the museum however, if that's any consolation. Also, beware roaming dogs nearby... they do indeed bite."
37,Merzbacher Lake,"Ak-Su, Kyrgyzstan",Glacial lake that mysteriously empties itself every year.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/merzbacher-lake,"A strenuous multi-day trek is necessary to reach Merzbacher Lake, a lake so far away from anything, that even the label “remote” would be an understatement. The lake is located at the confluence of the Inylchek Glacier in one of the most inaccessible regions of the Tian Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan. Even in a country like Kyrgyzstan, so blessed with stunning natural scenery, Merzbacher Lake is truly outstanding. Every spring, when the frozen lake melts, the lake’s waters lap at the tongue of the glacier and successively breaks off chunks of ice. The lake filled with drifting icebergs is a spectacular sight, but that is not all there is to Merzbacher Lake. The lake constitutes a phenomenon known as a proglacial lake, a lake dammed by a glacier. Proglacial lakes are found in various locations all over the world, but usually they enlarge until the glacier retreats, or are short-lived in their existence. Merzbacher Lake however, is highly exceptional since the lake repeatedly gets emptied, just to get refilled soon after. The process, still not fully understood by geologists, can be described like this: the melt water fills up the lake in the summer months at a rate of up to two meters per day. When the lake is filled, it bursts out and completely empties itself within just three days. The release of the water occurrs when the dam of ice buoys upwards and opens up a number of glacial channels in the damming glacier. The water then discharges through the glacier into the valley on the other side of the ice, where it flows into the Inylchek River. When the lake has emptied, the ice dam lowers, thereby blocking the glacial channels. As a result, the lake begins to fill up again. The cycle of the emptying and subsequent refilling of the lake occurrs at least once per year, in some years even twice. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to estimate the timing when the emptying begins. It usually takes place in August, but in some years it has occurred as early as Mid-July. Because of the difficult estimate to reach the lake at the right time, so far only very few people have witnessed the phenomenon.",
38,Bishkek Circus,"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan","This retro, UFO-like structure is a remnant of the Soviet-era circus.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bishkek-circus,"Designed in 1976, this UFO-shaped structure was built to welcome circus acts from around the world—or, more likely, from around the USSR. Unlike many structures of its kind, the Bishkek Circus still functions as an actual circus to this day. In fact, this architectural gem is a testimony to the role that the circus played in the Soviet Union. Due to the lack of official records, it is all but impossible to pinpoint when the first circus appeared. Itinerant acts consisting of proto-clowns and musicians called skomorokhy wandered the Russian land in the 11th century, and they used to combine music, magic performance, dancing, and slapstick humor. They were more akin to street performers than to the circus, but the seeds were planted, and very soon, show booths began appearing where the audience was treated to trapeze and gymnastic stunts. The year 1877 saw the opening of the first stationary circus, in St. Petersburg. The target audience was the Russian aristocracy, which did not fail to embrace the daredevils that performed at the circus. After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the aristocracy was abolished and the circus was nationalized and transformed into a high art form comparable to ballet and opera. Under the aegis of the Soviet regime, circus acts like The Moscow Circus gained global recognition. Stationary structures purpose-built for the circus became common in all major Soviet cities, including Bishkek.",
39,Dungan Mosque,"Karakol, Kyrgyzstan","Built entirely of interlocking pieces, construction of this Chinese Muslim house of worship required zero nails.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dungan-mosque,"Built by Dungans—Chinese Muslims who fled persecution in the 1800s—this stunning mosque is an architectural wonder that uses no nails whatsoever. Karakol is a town located on the South-Eastern shore of Issyk-Kul Lake in Kyrgyzstan. Founded in 1869 as a Russian military station, the town grew over time to become the fourth largest city in the country. Karakol soon became a popular year-round destination because of its ski slopes in winter and beautiful lakeshore and hikes available in the summer. In the 1800s, a group of Chinese Muslims—known as Dungans—fled political unrest in China and arrived at Karakol. The arrival of the Dungans diversified the Karakol community and injected the culture with elements of Chinese tradition and architecture. In 1904, a Dungan man named Ibrahim Aji commissioned the building of the mosque that was eventually named after the Dungan ethnic group. Ibrahim Aji conscripted Chou Seu, an architect based in Beijing, and twenty master carvers to build a mosque following two principal guidelines: the design had to conform to the Chinese architectural tradition, and it had to be built with no nails. These requirements resulted in a mosque that exhibits ingenious ways of carving and assembling each component of the building. It took six years to construct the mosque, which is held up by 42 main pillars topped by a three-tiered wooden frame. The result is a mosque that looks remarkably like a Chinese Buddhist temple, which testifies to the pre-Islamic history of the Dungan community. The color blue prevails, but yellow and red elements also stand out.  These colors are highly symbolic in the Dungan tradition. All along the perimeter of Dungan Mosque, the beams are decorated with colorful images of plants and fruit. Dungan Mosque was spared by Soviet purges, which destroyed the other eight mosques in Karakol, but the building was repurposed as a storehouse between 1929 and 1947. Following the end of WWII, Dungan Mosque was handed back to the Dungan community, which ensured the upkeep of the building to this day. Dungan Mosque is now the only example of Chinese architecture in Karakol and it is a registered historical building protected by Kyrgyz law.","The entrance to the mosque on on Bektenova street, a fairly short walk from the center of Karakol. Women can get robes at the entrance to the mosque, so they can dress casually throughout the rest of the day. A common and affordable way to travel around Kyrgyzstan is by public transportation, known locally as marshrutkas. Much like a standard bus, marshrutkas have designated routes that pick up and drop off passengers along the way. Karakol can best be reached from the capital city of Bishkek by either marshrutkas (five to six hours travel time) or by flight. The closest airport is Tamchy (IKU) near Lake Issyk-Kul. Once in Karakol, the Dungan Mosque is a short six-minute walk from the city center on Bektenova str."

Balasagun, established by the Karakhanids in the 9th century, has virtually disappeared. Only a few mausolea remains, some remnants of a fortification and this half minaret are still visible from Balasagun. Numerous earthquakes have destroyed the rest of the city, with fragments reused for newer buildings. Earthquakes have also taken its toll on the minaret, and the top half toppled after a major earthquake in the 15th century. The fall reduced its height from 45 to 25 meters. In the 1970s, the minaret was renovated. Centuries of repeated earthquakes in one of the most seismically-active regions in the world had severely damaged the minaret, and it was in danger of collapse. Strangely, the entrance to the minaret is not on ground level, but a couple of meters above via a metal staircase. Inside the minaret a steep spiral staircase runs to the top of a the final remaining structure of a lost city.

It is located 20 kilometers from Karakol, in the mountains at an altitude of more than 3,500 meters above sea level. The glacial lake surrounded by high rocks has an unreal blue hue. The lake was formed by tectonic movements. The ascent to Ala Kul is quite difficult. And it is easier, and best done in mid-summer in July or August. The trail is rocky and steep all the time. Because of the altitude, the weather is quite variable. But it is most beautiful on a bright, sunny day. At the top of the Ala kul pass is the best panoramic view. To spend the night on the shore of the lake is a separate pleasure. A lucky traveler may meet a flock of wild goats.",Do not take overly heavy things and equipment to hike to Ala kul. Do not forget that the climate here is quite cold. Before climbing is desirable to undergo acclimatization. Get relevant information before you visit.

This is Aalam Ordo, a failed project initiated under a president long gone. Constructed in 2009, Aalam Ordo was supposed to be a center for culture, science and spirituality. The vision behind the project was grand. This would be a place where the Kyrgyz youth would meet elders to exchange ideas and learn without lectures, curriculum, or lessons. The community would live in 365 yurts, 36 of which were designated for the elders. The hope was that this would foster and develop a new generation whose ideas could reach faraway countries and bring a Nobel Prize to Kyrgyzstan. Unfortunately, Aalam Ordo never became the renowned cultural center it was intended to become. In 2010, then-president Kurmanbek Bakiyev was removed from power in the Second Kyrgyz Revolution. The project was never completed, and the complex sits empty now, a mysterious ruin slowly being taken over by nature. Colorful murals and statues can be found throughout the complex. The art features traditional Kyrgyz motives like eagles and hawks, and also events from recent history. One of the murals depicts a dragon terrorizing a village, stealing all its riches. One by one the men in the village go to fight the dragon and finally one of them succeeds; but instead of returning to the village with all his riches, he himself turns into a dragon that continues to terrorize the village. This symbolizes the cycle of corruption in Kyrgyzstan, and how those fighting it have become just as corrupt once they were part of the system. The mural even features the parliament building in Bishkek with snipers on its roof, a clear symbol of the political unrest at the time.",Aalam Ordo is located along the road on the southern shore of lake Issyk-Kul a few kilometers east of Kaji-Say.
43,Kojomkul Memorial,"Kojomkul, Kyrgyzstan",An unusual monument to a gentle giant who became a Kyrgyz hero.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kojomkul-memorial,"Kojomkul was a seven-and-a-half-foot tall Kyrgyz giant who weighed over 350 pounds and was reportedly able to lift and carry a full-grown horse. In another demonstration of his incredible strength, he reputedly once lifted a 1,500-pound boulder. Born in 1889 in a small village called Suusamyr, he became a sensation of his time by winning each and every wrestling and strength competition along the Silk Road. Feats of strength aside, Kojomkul’s many good deeds earned him a “gentle giant” reputation. He gained widespread respect for donating sheep and horses won in competitions to villagers in need, which would explain why after his death in 1955, the village was eventually named after him. A small museum in town houses a collection of Kojomkul’s belongings and some pictures of him lifting heavy weights. At the outskirts of Kojomkul village is an unusual monument dedicated to the memory of Kojomkul the hero. It consists of a mud building in the shape of a yurt covered by a rickety wooden shelter. Sightings of these wooden shelters are not uncommon, but they are usually no bigger than an average umbrella and are fixed in tombstones, whereas the one in Kojomkul is much larger, and it encompasses the whole mud-yurt. Along one of the poles radiating from the sustaining pillar, people have tied several cloths as a tribute to Kojomkul’s superhuman strength.","The memorial is located just beyond the village on the road to Kyzyl-Oi. There is also a statue and museum honoring the local hero within the village itself. A wooden pillar set in the center of the yurt sustains the whole structure, but huge cracks in the upper sections of the yurt suggests that sooner or later, the ceiling will cave in if structural reinforcement is not put in place."
44,Min Kush,"Ming-Kush, Kyrgyzstan","This village was once a thriving Soviet uranium mining center, but is now semi-abandoned and desolate.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/min-kush,"Min Kush, which means “a thousand birds” in Kyrgyz, was formally established in 1955 as an industrial town built around a uranium mine. At its peak, the population reached around 20,000. After the fall of the Soviet Union and closure of the mine, it dropped to just 2,000. Today the impoverished village is deteriorating; many buildings are empty and boarded up, and radiation levels can reach 10 times higher the norm. While some coal mines are still active, the majority of residents are unemployed, living on small pensions leftover from the town’s glory days. While houses in most villages are usually built for a single family and rarely surpass two floors, the buildings in Min Kush are at least three or four times bigger. Some were actually flat-blocks, while others were probably used for administration. Now, they look rundown, but once upon a time they must have been stunning. Some of these buildings were completely abandoned, and are crumbling and overgrown with vegetation. Further uphill is a mining center. It is cordoned off, but it is obvious that someone is using these facilities as animal shelters, and sections of the surrounding land were actually cultivated. A semi-buried building bears the date 1955 on its facade. Another building has huge, deep holes in its floor. Other buildings are simply locked. Beyond the boundaries on the town, there are four radioactive mill piles. The biggest pile, Tuyuk-Suu, is located in a valley, and two canals were built to divert a stream running in the middle to avoid contamination. Lack of maintenance has led to water trickling over the canals, making the whole area unsafe. The other three piles are also in dire need of maintenance. Cows, sheep and goats graze freely in the meadows surrounding the piles.","Min Kush is potentially dangerous to visit. Certain areas are marked with red warning signs depicting radiation, a skull, and (curiously) a human figure running. Other areas are cordoned off. Set deep in the Min Kush Valley, along the Min Kush River, the road to the village is bumpy, muddy, and dangerous, and with very little traffic. Although there is public transport, it is not obvious how often and when it comes by. A safer option to reach Min Kush is by a 4x4 vehicle.

In the Kyrgyz language, Saimaluu-Tash means “patterned/embroidered stone.” These works of rock art date back as far as 4,000 years ago, and were carved over time by a number of different groups. There are two areas with carved rocks. The longest one is more than three kilometers long and between the two there is a pond. The large galleries of petroglyphs appear to show scenes of hunting, shamanic rituals, and sexual intercourse, with a mystic meaning or for votive reasons. The oldest pieces are thought to date to the second or third century B.C., and new art was added into the Middle Ages. Archaeologists have found evidence of a settlement at the site from the eighth century B.C. to first century A.D. The Saka priests are believed to have used the site for sacrificial rites. The site was sacred to the people of Tien Shan and Pre Ferghana, and is even now sacred to the modern generation of Kyrgizians for spiritual and healing qualities. The area is reachable only in August by foot (six to eight hours of hard trekking) or horse (three to four hours) passing through fields of grass, woads, on the top of a glaciers in a constant ascent usually in a very small pathway.","To reach the area there is a ticket to buy in Kazarman, where is possible to arrange guides, a Jeep to reach the base where to start the climb, and horses."

The building is covered with images of common workers revolting against the privileged classes, Soviet soldiers, and the sickle and hammer symbol of Soviet Russia. The museum is dedicated to and named for a local hero of Bishkek, Mikhail Frunze. He was a leader during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, who later became a Major Red Army Commander. Although Frunze was not of Kyrgyz ethnicity, he was born in Bishkek to Russian and Romanian parents. He spent 10 years in a prison in Siberia, from which he escaped, and is most famous for the key role he played in the defeat of Baron Wrangel in Crimea in 1920. The building where the Frunze Museum is located was built after Frunze’s death, around the cottage where the revolutionary was born and raised. The museum’s three floors display all sorts of items from Frunze’s life: his uniforms and weapons, books he read, books he wrote, black-and-white pictures of Frunze with various Soviet figures and with his family, newspaper cut-outs reporting his military successes, and so on. Of note, there are several documents of Soviet propaganda, a large painting of Frunze with Lenin discussing military plans, a horse-drawn cart with a machine gun mounted on it, and a larger-than-life bronze statue of the Bolshevik leader.","The house is locked, but the museum staff will open it for visitors. It is fully furnished and the rooms are carefully cordoned off, but it is possible to walk through the corridor and take photos. Most of the informative signs are only  in Kyrgyz and Russian, but there is still plenty to see, making the museum a worthwhile visit for English speakers as well."
47,Jeti-Ögüz Rocks,Kyrgyzstan,"According to myth, there's a bloody explanation for the beautiful bright red color of this rock formation set amidst alpine vegetation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jeti-oguz-rocks,"Jeti-Ögüz is a bright red rock formation that lends its name to a nearby resort, a village, and a whole Kyrgyz district. To differentiate it from these other entities, the formation is sometimes referred to as Jeti-Ögüz Rocks or Jeti-Ögüz Canyon. The name of this protected natural monument in Kyrgyzstan translates as “Seven Bulls,” a reference a mythological dispute between two rival khans. The wife of one of the khans betrayed her husband to join the second khan. Conspiracies and subterfuges ensued, and the climax of the legend coincides with the slaughtering of seven bulls during a party in which the betrayed khan stabbed his wife to death. This caused a deluge of blood that covered the seven bulls, the khan, his servants and the surrounding mountains. Hence the bright red rock formation. For those unsatisfied with the mythological explanation for nature of the formation, these rocks consist of conglomerate of fragments of geological detritus. The oblique layering of these rocky protrusions is due to millions of years of sedimentation. In fact, these layers are more reminiscent of a dragon’s scales rather than bulls, and this resemblance probably did not go unnoticed, as the adjacent valley is called Ushchelie Drakanov (Valley of Dragons).

48,Eki-Naryn Forest Swastika,"Tash-Bashat, Kyrgyzstan",The origin of this sinisterly shaped forest is rooted in mystery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ekinaryn-forest-swastika,"On the hillside outside of the village of Tash-Bashat grows a forest obviously shaped by a human hand. Even though it’s mirrored and some of the arms are incomplete, it’s still an unmistakable symbol. The origins of this forest swastika, which measures nearly 600 feet across, are unclear. As such, legends about its creation abound. One theory is that German prisoners of war planted the trees while in captivity after World War II. However, there’s no evidence to support this, despite the fact that 1.3 million German soldiers went missing within the Soviet Union and were forced to do labor. Locals living in the area claim that only Kyrgyz planters worked there and that the forest was planted in the ‘40s or ‘50s. Another theory is that the trees were planted in the 1940s by Kyrgyz workers under the instruction of a German Nazi sympathizer who had been exiled to Kyrgyzstan during the war. Others say that the trees were planted right after Stalin’s death in 1953, and still more claim they were planted in the ‘30s to symbolize the Soviet-German friendship at the time. There are even those claiming that the symbol is completely unrelated to World War II. This theory says the forest takes the shape of an ancient Hindu symbol used long before the Nazis came into power. But this proposal is clearly flawed, as the trees were planted sometime in the mid-20th century after the Nazis had already corrupted the symbol’s meaning within popular culture. Whatever the background of the Eki-Naryn forest swastika is, it keeps reminding people of the horrors of the 20th century and probably will as long as it exists.","The Eki-Naryn Forest Swastika is located outside of the village of Tash-Bashat in Kyrgyzstan. The nearest bigger city is Naryn, which is roughly 50 minutes away by car."

The largest of them is located in the center of the valley, and shares a name with a nearby mountain pass. Known as San Tash, it is a four-meter-high mound with a diameter of 56 meters. The name San Tash means “counted stones.” The site is associated with the great commander and conqueror known as Tamerlane (sometimes called Timur). Legend holds that Tamerlane asked each of his soldiers to take a stone and drop it in that place, so he would have an idea of the size of his army. After the battle, he asked the soldiers to take back their stone to have an idea of the war casualties. The remaining pile of stones represented how many soldiers had died during battle. Tamerlane ordered the mounds be left as a monument to the fallen soldiers and as a reminder of the hardships and stages of wars.",

52,Kuang Si Waterfalls,Laos,This tiered waterfall is so pretty it may cause visitors to cry tears of their own.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuang-si-waterfalls,"Nestled in the Laos jungle near the Tat Kuang Si Bear Rescue Centre, the cascading tiers of the Kuang Si Waterfalls draw gawking onlookers seeking a little bit of serene beauty in the midst of the jungle’s cacophony. The vibrant blue waters that flow down the falls travel down through a series of pools before rejoining the flow of the jungle river. After ages of flowing over the rocks, the falls have etched deep lines into the stone creating a beautiful travertine pattern. The pools are smaller near the top of the falls, but tend to widen out nearer to the bottom eventually becoming big enough to swim in should the tropical heat inspire someone to jump in as it often does. The locals (who charge a small fee to visitors to the falls) have built out a wooden platform that visitors can take in the rushing waters from, or even dive off of in some places. Reaching the Kuang Si Falls is a bit tricky as they are pretty far off the beaten path and require a willing driver or rental. However the ubiquitous tuk-tuk drivers in the nearby town of Lunag Prabang are generally willing to take anyone interested in traveling to the falls for a nominal (if negotiable) fee. It’s well worth it to haggle your way into a ride to the falls not just to escape the heat by swimming in the pools, but also to soak in some natural beauty found few other places in the world.",
53,Kong Lor Cave,Laos,"A boat ride through utter darkness, lit only by headlamps, reveals an emerald green pool locals believe is sacred.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kong-lor-cave,"Most visitors to Laos tend to focus on the north, but there are many reasons for venturing a bit farther south. Kong Lor Cave, considered to be one of South Asia’s geological wonders, is definitely one of them. Karst limestone caves are particularly appealing due to their unusual rock formations, but Kong Lor is no ordinary limestone cave. In fact, it was formed by the Nam Hin Bun River running through an entire mountain, sculpting the rock along its way. Inside, there’s a pool of water with an emerald-tinted glow that locals believe is sacred. Visitors can hire a wooden boat and an experienced boatman who will negotiate the sprawling caverns. They’ll take you through massive passages with majestic stalactites and towering stalagmites. There are also narrow passages that require skills and intimate familiarity with the cave, the depth of the river, the strength of the currents, and, of course, the itinerary. Navigating the cave is usually performed in utter blackness, aided by only the feeble, flickering lights of headlamps. Kong Lor Cave is still used by villagers to transport goods and, if visited at the time of harvest, tobacco as well. Located in Khammouane Province, in the geographical heart of Laos,  it can be reached by following a rural road from Ban Khoun Kham or by taking a boat from Ban Naphouak.",There are several accommodation options in the area catering for all budgets.
54,Plain of Jars,"Phonsavan, Laos","Believed to have once stored either human remains or rice wine, thousands of mysterious stone jars lie in ruin.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plain-of-jars,"The Plain of Jars is a collection of large stone jars interspersed throughout the Xieng Khouang plain in the Lao Highlands. The stone structures are mostly made of sedimentary rock and, ranging from 3 to 10 feet in height (1 to 3 meters), each can weigh up to 14 tons. To date, the origin of the jars is unknown, though archaeologists believe that they were originally used between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. Many researchers have theorized that the jars may have once served as funerals urns or food storage. As local Laotian legend would have it, the jars were created by Khun Cheung, an ancient king of giants who lived in the highlands. It is said that Cheung, after fighting a long and victorious battle, created the jars in order to brew huge amounts of celebratory lao lao rice wine. The Plain of Jars received relatively little Western attention until the 1930s, when French archaeologist Madeleine Colani began surveying the area. Though previous reports of the jars had cited the existence of goods such as carnelian beads, jewelry, and axes, the site was mostly looted by the time Colani arrived. Despite this, Colani discovered a nearby cave housing human remains, such as burned bones and ash, leading her to believe that the jars were funeral urns for chieftains. Colani excavated the artifacts, some of which dated to between 500 BC and 800 AD, and published her findings in The Megaliths of Upper Laos. Though the Xieng Khouang plain remains the central site of the jars, similar clusters can be connected to form a linear path all the way to northern India. The existence of similar jar clusters in other parts of Asia also led to the belief that the jars were part of a large trade route. Some researchers believe that the jars collected monsoon rainwater for caravan travelers to use during dry season. Travelers would use the water and then leave behind prayer beads or offerings in the jars, thus explaining previous sightings of jewelry and assorted goods. Though the caretakers for the Plain of Jars are applying for status as a UNESCO World Heritage site, the area still remains one of the most dangerous archaeological sites in the world. Thousands of unexploded bombs remain from the Secret War of the 1960s, and some of these arms still cause injuries to this day. As such, only Sites 1, 2, 3 and the Quarry are open to visitors, while a number of organizations work to remove explosives and apply for more funding. Any visit to the jar sites takes one past numerous large bomb craters and crater clusters. Further adding to the area’s mystique, the many varied casings of these American bombs are used extensively to decorate houses and roadsides in nearby of Phonsavan, the provincial capital. Scrap metal collection is one of the major economic activities here. Researchers have traced the jars back to a quarry a few miles outside of Phonsavan.  The area was also used extensively during the war by the Pathet Laos (Lao Nation, the communist political movement) who hid in natural and human-made caves here in the quarry.","Many visitors fly to Phonsavan from Luang Prabang on one of the national airlines' small, propeller-driver passenger planes. The fare is cheap. Buses run daily from Vietiane, Vang Vieng, and Luang Prabang to Phonsavan; there used to be a local bus service, but it has ceased service and now the only shared motor transit out of Phonsavan are the 9AM minivans.The three main jar sites can be visited by jeep/taxi arranged through one of the guesthouses or tour companies, or by motorcycles, which are easy to rent in town. Note that of the 3 most commonly visited Jar Sites (named Site 1, 2, and 3, although there are over 40 Jar Sites in total) Site 1 is by far the busiest and most touristy, being closest to the city and containing a small museum; Laotians and foreign tourists alike can frequently be seen taking pictures or Facetiming friends and relatives while sitting on the jars. By contrast, one might very well pass half a day at Sites 2 & 3 without seeing anyone besides farmers and cows. If you hire a walking guide, they can take you on a hike of around 1 hour between Sites 2 & 3; this hike should not be attempted without a guide as it goes through the private yards and houses of local farmers. From Site 2 there is a lovely hiking trail through a pine forest- cleared of UXOs, though the trail is not always maintained- to a viewpoint on a hill."
55,Xieng Khuan (Buddha Park),"Vientiane, Laos",More than 200 statues filled with cryptic symbols give this park spot an aura of horror vacui fantasy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/xieng-khuan-park-0,"The park has something distinctly ancient looking about it. Giant Buddhas lounge as Vishnu looks on, and Shiva menaces both with eight arms full of weaponry. In fact, the Xieng Khuan, or “Spirit City” park was built in 1958 by Luang Pu (translated as Venerable Grandfather) Bunleua Sulilat. Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat was a priest-shaman, myth-maker, mystic and sculpture artist with a large following in Laos and later in Thailand. Born into a family of eight children in Thailand Sulilat was supposedly mentored by a hermit named Keoku whom he met after falling in cave. Sulilat’s particular brand of mysticism integrated Hinduism and Buddhism and united the Thai and Laotian peoples. Later Sulilat was forced to flee from Laos to Thailand after the revolution in 1975. There, he built another sculpture park, Sala Keoku in Nong Khai. Xieng Khuan park was Sulilat’s first sculpture park and was built by the side of the Mekong River, about 25 kilometers from Vientiane. Said to have been built by himself and his students – all non-trained artists – the park is an astounding display of outsider artistry. The iconography is reflective of the imaginative the philosophy of this man, and closely resembles a south-east Asian interpretation of the mannerist gardens of 1600s Europe such as the Monsters of Bomazaro park, in Italy. The more than 200 statues, filled with cryptic symbols, concentrated in a small area give the Xieng Khuan park spot an aura of horror vacui fantasy. Among these ferro-concrete sculptures are skeleton thin Buddhas, a giant pumpkin with with a demon head for an opening and three floors representing Heaven, Hell and Earth as well as a gigantic 40 meter long reclining Buddha. Sadly, the place is about to fall into ruins because of floods from the Mekong River and a general lack of conservation. If it is now already a place of surreal lore that looks of ancient ruins, it will surely transform into something even stranger when it actually becomes ruins.","To get there, you can take a bus (Bus #14 from Vientianes main bus station) which run about every 40 minutes. Be careful with hiring a tuk-tuk though; more than likely you will be charged an exorbitant amount to get there and back.There are sometimes food carts about that serve food and beer, as well as a nearby riverside restaurant.The entrance fee is 15000 kip for foreigners."

Among this multitude, two stand apart, renowned for their beautifully imperfect contents. Primarily a religious site, the Pak Ou Buddha Caves are located inside a steep rock face that droops over the sacred site like tobacco-stained teeth. Accessed by a brilliant white-washed, zigzagging staircase, the boats dock at the bottom and allow for pilgrims and tourists alike to ascend into the upper and lower caves for exploration. Once inside, visitors are met with thousands of statues of the Buddha. Ranging in size, quality, and material, the only factor uniting these effigies are their minor imperfections. Roam long enough, and you can spot each; some are missing hands and or have chipped faces, while others list to the side or were replaced by newer versions less love-worn from ages of devotion. Before their discovery by outsiders, the perfectly imperfect contents at Pak Ou’s caves were only considered on an annual basis; during the Laotian New Year, practitioners of the faith would come to bathe in the caves in hopes of receiving boons in the coming year. Now that the caves have become a semi-known tourist destination, boat operators hired to take visitors to the cave often make a detour on the way home for the Lao Lao “whiskey village.” Here visitors are offered the opportunity to sample the townsfolk’s famously potent home-brewed potables before continuing the ferry ride back to Luang Prabang, which doesn’t sound like such a bad idea since there’s a man paid to get you all home in one piece. By the end of your journey to Pak Ou, visitors will have washed back ashore in Luang Prabang having touched on every single holy facet of ancient and modern life in a single afternoon – beginning with a watery trek into a world populated with misfit deities made more holy for their outcast nature, only to then chase the experience with a physical and spiritual reunion with the living, all while being shuttled to and fro atop one of the most revered rivers in the world.",Purchase ticket at Luang Prabang long boat office.

Operated by Free the Bears, a fund set up to save imperiled ursines across the globe, the Tat Kuang Si Bear Rescue Centre caters specifically to the Asian black bear. The bile from the black bear’s gall bladder is a common component in traditional Chinese medicine, and unfortunately a brutal black market has sprung up around milking the animals for their vital juices. Kept in inhumane conditions, the illegally trapped bears would be repeatedly harvested so long as they could survive in their tiny cages. In addition, the animals are often poached to be used as food or even pets. Tragic origins aside, the bears at the rescue center lead a fulfilling life in the open enclosures that provide enough space and stimulation to keep the animals happy and healthy. Visitors to the refuge can stroll along the wooden paths and view the adorable (if grizzly) beasts as they lounge, play and generally look more cuddly than killer. There are also informative signs that inform guests of the plight of the Asian black bear, but even the sad facts can’t keep the rescued bears from being utterly heartwarming.","30km southwest of Luang Prabang, the Centre is located at the foot of the trail to Tat Kuang Si Waterfall"

Apparently, today only a solitary monk by the name of Soubane inhabits the area. This plateau is also home to the jungle temple, Wat Dane Soung. The Wat Dane Soung is believed to have been built in the first millennium by the Mon, and features a number of Dvaravati-style Buddha images carved into the rock. Many of these images have been painted gold. In 1986 construction of a new temple began, but was never completed due to lack of funds. A few years later, in the early 1990’s, the Lane Xang Hotel built a restaurant on site in hopes of encouraging tourism. As local legend has it, the necessary ceremonies for appeasing the spirits were not performed, resulting in a fire that burned down the new building.

Yet, if you take your time to stop by the bridge over the Namkading River and look around, you may be able to spot some missile-like boats in the river. They are not missiles, but their shape is no coincidence, for they used to be fuel tanks on U.S. B-52 bombers, which dropped a massive amount of ordnance all over the region in the 1960s and ’70s, at the height of the Vietnam War. The high quality of this wartime scrap metal didn’t go unnoticed, and Tha Bak villagers started turning the spherical debris into boats—very, very durable boats. It is possible to pay to take a spin in one of these so-called bomb boats. Of note, northwest of Tha Bak is Nam Kading National Diversity Park, and Nam Kading River is a major entry point.  Bomb boats will probably be unable to go past the rapids, but up to that point, it can be an interesting ride.",The bomb boats are easily visible from the high bridge along Route 8 at Tha Bak.

60,Patuxai,"Vientiane, Laos","When the USA donated cement and funds to expand the airport in Laos, the Laotians built a massive monument instead.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/patuxai,"Patuxai is a massive war monument and triumphal arch in the center of Vientiane, Laos. It was completed in 1968, using funds donated by the United States – funds that were meant to be used for the construction of an airport. Patuxai, meaning Victory Gate in English (and variously written as Patuxay, Patousai and Patusai), was built between 1957 and 1968 in memory of the Laotian soldiers who died during World War II and the war of independence from France in 1949. It’s also known as the Arc de Triomphe of Vientiane due to its resemblance to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Patuxai, however, is slightly taller than its Parisian counterpart, has four gates rather than two, and is covered in distinctly Laotian designs. The exterior of the monument is decorated with traditional Laotian motifs, including Buddhist symbols, Hindu deities and female spirits of the clouds and waters known as apsaras. The ceilings beneath the four arches are decorated with further depictions of Hindu gods, such as Brahma and Vishnu, and mythological creatures like the mythical bird-woman Kinnaree and the three-headed elephant Erawan. On top of Patuxai, meanwhile, sit five towers, again built in the traditional Laotian style. Four of these are located on each corner of the monument, while a fifth rises up from the center, higher than the rest. These five towers are decorated with flower motifs and each is topped with a golden finial. Needless to say, the construction of the Patuxai monument was a costly project. The Laotian government, however, managed to fund the bulk of the effort with money donated from the United States – despite that money having been donated for an entirely different project. In the 1950s, the United States provided Laos with funds and a huge amount of concrete for the expansion of the city’s airport, which could then serve as a base for US fighter jets during the Vietnam War. But the funds and concrete arrived before any contract had been signed, so the Royal Laotian Government decided to build a massive triumphal arch, rather than an airport serving foreign interests. For this reason, locals jokingly refer to Patuxai by another name: the Vertical Runway. No mention of this is made on the sign attached to Patuxai. But the sign is strangely honest in other ways, stating that the monument was never actually completed due to the country’s turbulent history, and that “From a closer distance, it [Patuxai] appears even less impressive, like a monster of concrete.” Not a glowing appraisal, but refreshingly frank.","Patuxai is located along Lane Xang Avenue, within easy walking distance from downtown Vientiane (where most tourists stay). Visitors can climb the stairs that lead up through the seven stories inside the monument, passing through souvenir shops, a small museum and all the way to the top where the main viewing platform is located. Patuxai is open Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the weekend. The entrance is 3,000 kips (about $0.35 US)."

Tham Piew was a vast cave that served as a shelter for the local community seeking refuge from the bombing campaigns that were designed to contain the Marxist Pathet Lao. Today, Tham Piew is open to the public as both a memorial and a testament to a harrowing era in Laos history. There is a small interpretive center at the base of the mountain near the parking area that explains the significance of the site from a Laotian perspective. A visit to Tham Piew isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s a journey that should be undertaken with the utmost respect for the local community and the deceased buried in marked graves along the walkway to the cave. Visitors can also leave an offering with a Buddhist monk at the base of the steps to the cave in memory of the victims.","Just north of Muang Kham, follow the signs labeled Tham Piew."
62,Crocodile Stone,"Champasak, Laos",This mysteriously shaped boulder may have been used for human sacrifice in ancient times.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crocodile-stone,"In the Phou Khao Mountains of southern Laos lie the ancient ruins of Wat Phu, a Hindu temple of Khmer origins. Among the temple remains is a boulder with a very curious carving. The deep impression in the stone vaguely resembles a crocodile, but it could also easily accommodate a human body. It has been speculated that this stone may have been used as an altar to perform an annual human sacrifice in pre-Angkhor times. While most of the ruins of Wat Phu date to between the 11th century and 13th century, there is archaeological evidence that a temple existed at the site as early as the 5th century.  If human sacrifices were performed, they would date back to these earlier times, when southern Laos was ruled by the Chenla Empire. Oral tradition has it that once a year, when the frangipani petals started falling, the Chenla king would sit on the main causeway of Wat Phu. The king would pray to the spirits of the mountains and offer rice wine to two girls selected for their beauty. The girls would then be sacrificed to propitiate the gods’ favors for the coming year. To corroborate the veracity of this story, there is mention in the 6th-century History of the Sui that human sacrifice was performed annually in the Chenla culture, and the description of the ceremony matches the version in the local folklore. It may simply be a retelling of the description in the ancient text, but the fact that rural communities retained that specific tale through the centuries is significant. What is not known, however, is the role the Crocodile Rock played in this ceremony, if any. The uniqueness of carving makes it even more mysterious. Over the whole of Laos and Cambodia, nothing even remotely resembling the Crocodile Stone can be found in ruins from before, during, or after the Chenla Empire. Curiouser still, crocodiles did (and still do) exist in the area, but they didn’t have a religious significance. If the Crocodile Stone was not used for human sacrifice, the mystery remains: What was it for?","Wat Phou is about 6 miles (10 km) southwest of Champasak, the main town in the area.

It does nothing to convey the hidden marvel it leads to. Secluded within the woods is a group of Buddha sculptures carved into the rock. Its name translates to “Elephant Palace” and references an elephant graveyard supposedly once discovered nearby. No one knows for sure when the mysterious sculptures were created, and guesses range from the 10th century to the 16th century. The biggest statues are about 10 feet high, but some smaller statues can be found in the surrounding area. If you look closely at the rocks, you’ll also notice less ornate carvings of Buddha practically hidden behind the greenery. Overgrown with vegetation, the whole shrine feels abandoned and forgotten, like it could be lost to time at any moment. The centuries-old figures are pale, their gold paint peeling and faded. The Buddhas all have peaceful, serene expressions that mirror the quiet, undisturbed atmosphere of the shrine.","Heading North on Road no. 13, is a sign saying Van Xang.

There is everything on the menu, ranging from Asian specialties to American standbys like steak and pizza. Overall, Craters is not that remarkable as a restaurant. However, Craters is immediately set apart from other cheap eateries by the giant bomb shells flanking the patio seating. For those who visit without any knowledge of history, the decor seems a bit off-putting, but with a little background, begins to make sense. The city of Phonsavan was absolutely pummeled during the Vietnam War. The American military was convinced Vietcong were escaping the country into Laos through Phonsavan. In response, American forces dropped 500,000 missiles onto the surrounding area, making it one of the most bombed places in the world. In the aftermath of the war, people moved back to Phonsavan and began rebuilding, often using the remnants of bombs in their construction. Craters opened up, ironically to serve Western backpackers from the very country that left Phonsavan in ruins. Essentially, Craters is a kitschy exploitation restaurant, playing on the war-torn past of the city to either deliver a socially-conscious message, or bring in tourists desiring to be photographed in front of the restaurant.",

Between 1964 and 1973, the U.S. dropped two million tons of explosives on Laos, and the effect can still be felt today. Unexploded ordnance (UXO) riddle the landscape, and cluster bombs in particular continue to injure and kill many people in rural areas. The problem is so prevalent, an organization called COPE—short for the Cooperative Orthotic & Prosthetic Enterprise—was created to help with the recovery of the victims of bombs, by providing custom prosthetics, rehabilitative services, and education to rural communities affected by the bombs to attempt to prevent future accidents. To foreign visitors, particularly Americans, the COPE Visitor Centre is jarring and incredibly informative. The shadow war in Laos is clearly presented, complete with a sculpture of a dangling UXO right at the entrance. The “COPE” sign on the side of the building is created from used prosthetic feet.

It highlights how families are utilizing bomb materials while not understanding the danger they can cause. Pictures and stories accompany the displays, putting names and faces to the many thousands of victims of the military campaign in Laos. If there is one place for foreigners to visit in Vientiane, this may be it.","From their website: The Visitor Centre is located in Vientiane, Laos, in the grounds of the Centre for Medical Rehabilitation (CMR), on Khouvieng Road, across the street from the Green Park Hotel.

Then head straight towards the white building at the end of the road with “COPE Visitor Centre” painted on it."
67,Wat Phia Wat,"Muang Khoun, Laos",This ruined temple's giant Buddha statue bears the scars of the Second Indochina War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phia-wat,"It is difficult to imagine that the diminutive village where Wat Phia Wat is located, Muang Khoun, used to be the capital of the Phuan Kingdom in the 14th century. Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese armies and looters ransacked Muang Khoun for centuries before the Second Indochina War broke out and the town was heavily bombed by the U.S. Air Force. Entire swathes of the town were razed to the ground, including a number of religious sites. Wat Phia Wat collapsed but, against all odds, the large Buddha statue sitting in the temple survived. What is now referred to as Wat Phia Wat is the compound enclosing both the new temple and the remains of the old one. The new temple is a modern run-of-the-mill Lao temple, and not much of the old temple has stood the test of time, with the notable exception of a Buddha statue. Of the old temple building, only the brick foundation and some pillars remain standing. This may not be the most beautiful Buddha statue in the country, and the bombing certainly did not help; the right cheek and lips are scarred, and one eye is missing. Yet, this statue mirrors the resilience that the local people demonstrated in the face of almost complete annihilation. Perhaps this is the reason why it is revered by worshippers, that can often be seen praying at the feet of the statue, burning incense and making offerings. A ceremonial sash drapes from the Buddha’s left shoulder to the opposing hip, and in its lap are several Buddha statuettes.","Muang Khoun is located about 18 miles (30 km) southeast of Phonsavan. The main road goes by Wat Phia Wat. If you’re coming from Phonsavan, you’ll see the ruins of a French colonial building upon entering the village. Wat Phia Wat is about 200 yards further along the main road."
68,Bamboo Bridges of Luang Prabang,"Luang Prabang, Laos",These bamboo and rope bridges cross the Nam Khan River for six months every year.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bamboo-bridges-of-luang-prabang,"Luang Prabang was named a UNESCO world heritage site for its well-preserved French colonial architecture, but its true charms spring from the Lao culture. The streets are filled with Saffron-robed monks, local handicrafts, Buddhist temples, and hawker stalls selling river fish and sticky rice. Visitors flock to the old town’s famous Sai Bat almsgiving—a daily tradition unbroken for hundreds of years, but those who go wandering after the ceremony might discover a new tradition a short walk away—the seasonal bamboo bridges across the Nam Khan River. The Nam Khan winds through Luang Prabang before joining the wide Mekong, and during the rainy season residents and visitors use shuttle boats or the Old French Bridge to cross the swollen river. But when the dry season comes along, quicker and more charming options arise—two narrow bamboo bridges. In 2006, a local family erected the twin bridges for the first time and they’ve kept the practice going every November since. Although the bridges are designed primarily for tourist use, the construction is very traditional. Each bridge is made entirely of bamboo and rope (except for the lights), and though they might look (and feel) wobbly, they’re actually quite strong. They rely on bamboo’s natural strength and building techniques employed by Laos for generations. The bridges span the Nam Kahn until rainy season, when they are dismantled until the next year. The larger bridge, set at the picturesque bend of the Nam Khan just as it reaches the Mekong, connects Luang Prabang with two villages noted for their artisans—the weaver’s village of Ban Xieng Lek and the paper-making village of Ban Xiang Khong. The smaller bridge is slightly upstream and connects the old city to the newer side of town, as well as to restaurants and craft shops overlooking the river. This side arguably has the best view; visitors who take the bridge to the Dyen Sabai restaurant at sunset are in for a beautiful view of the fleeting bamboo structure.","The larger bridge can be found at the bottom of the path starting below the Riverpoint Cafe on Khem Khong road. The smaller bridge extends from the old steps leading down from Wat Siphoutthabath on Kingkitsarath Road. Make sure you check with a hotel or tour guide if planning a visit to include the bridges; their presence follows the whims of the river. Note that traversing the bridges is not free. Tickets are sold at small booths on the old town side of each bridge. Passage costs 10,000 Kip (about sixty cents U.S.) for a round trip ticket. It’s a pittance well-spent — the money goes to the families who build and maintain the bridges."
69,Muang Ngoi Neua,"Muang Ngoy, Laos",A quaint village where bomb casings from the Second Indochina War have been repurposed into mundane objects.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/muang-ngoi-neua,"Sitting on the banks of Ou River, Muang Ngoi Neua is an idyllic village. Only reachable via boat until 2013, this village has witnessed some rapid development due to the influx of tourism, but it has retained its rural quaintness. With the majestic karst limestone mountains as the backdrop, the feel is as rustic and remote as ever. Muang Ngoi Neua has a documented history that goes back to the 15th century, but it was events in the 2oth century that radically changed the lives of its people. During the Second Indochina War (1955-1975), forces of the Pathet Lao (Lao Communist Party) took shelter in the caves near the village. Being sympathetic to the North Vietnamese Communist Regime, Pathet Lao attracted much attention. During this period of time, the United States and U.S.-backed forces dropped over two million tons of cluster bombs over Laos, targeting North Vietnamese forces along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and Lao sympathizers. Cluster bombs were dropped in casings, which would open and scatter bombs over a large area. An estimated 30 percent of these bombs failed to explode on impact. Since the end of the war, more than 20,000 Lao people have been killed or maimed because they accidentally stepped on or hit unexploded ordnance. Alongside the bombs, however, bomb casings also fell on the ground. These casings were made of high-quality, durable metal. In the village of Tha Bak, people made boats out of them. In Muang Ngoi Neua, people repurposed them as flower pots, water troughs, fence poles, and steps, all of which can be seen around the village. Although a bridge connects Muang Ngoi Neua to the main road boats are still running south to Nong Khiaw, and north all the way to Phongsaly.",
70,Lao National Museum,"Vientiane, Laos","American bombs, morbid memorabilia, and graphic photographs tell the story of the CIA-led “Secret War” from the Pathet Lao perspective.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lao-national-revolutionary-museum,"Laos is known for its UNESCO-landmarked temples in Luang Prabang and the lush jungles located just across the Mekong from Thailand. Few realize it’s also the most heavily bombed country per capita in the world. Between 1964 and 1973, the United States army dropped 2 million tons of cluster bombs over Laos in a covert attempt by the CIA to wrest power from the Pathet Lao party aligned with the Viet Cong. That’s the equivalent a planeload of bombs dropped every 8 minutes, around the clock for nine years. The Pathet Lao won anyway, and this museum is dedicated to telling the story of that improbable victory. Visitors to the Lao National Museum, housed in the former French governor’s mansion, are quickly hurtled through the early history of Laos via a small exhibit of dinosaur bones and a St. Patrick’s Day green diorama of the Plain of Jars to arrive at the museum’s true focus: the Lao Revolution of the 1970s. You’ll see photos of entire classrooms of children being taught in underground caves to avoid the bombs, though there are photos of broken children and broken buddhas, too. Many Americans are familiar with photos of college students in the 1970s protesting the draft. Here, you’ll see arresting images of Lao holding “U.S., go home” signs and burning effigies of Henry Kissinger; not the type of thing you find in most American history books. Central to the museum’s narrative is the larger-than-life Comrade Kaysone Phomvihane, the revolutionary leader of the Pathet Lao and first prime minister of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. You’ll find “the gun used by Comrade Kaysone Phomvihane to protect himself during the fighting against the U.S. imperialists,” enclosed alongside “the briefcase for comrade Kaysone Phomvihane’s documents during the fighting against U.S. imperialists,” his tea kettle (you get the picture), and even a sort of bicep curl contraption used by the Comrade himself. The permanent exhibit ends with a display of unexploded American bombs and prosthetic limbs used by those unlucky enough to have come across one. About 50 people a year still die from the estimated 18 million bombs still buried beneath the soil. If you look close enough, you can make out the inscription on one of them: “Front toward enemy.” Update March 2019: The museum is no longer open. The nice rustic colonial building is still there and you can take photos outside of the territory. A new museum is under construction.","Note that the museum was formerly called the Lao Revolutionary Museum. Down the road from the museum is the visitor center for COPE, an organization that helps bomb victims with their recovery. It displays prosthetics as well as other artifacts and photographs telling the story of the war."
71,Spoon Village,"Ban Napia, Laos","Heavily bombed during the Vietnam War, this small town turns unexploded munitions into utensils.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ban-napia-unexploded-bomb-spoons-village,"The United States never formally declared war on Laos, but they still dropped more than 270 million cluster bombs on the country during the Vietnam War era. It is estimated that one-third of these did not explode. Nearly 50 years later, people in Laos are still killed or maimed when they encounter unexploded bombs or “ordnance” (UXO). These munitions also keep much of Laos in poverty because clearing land for agriculture or development is hazardous. Children are killed or injured when they mistake UXO for toys. Even the simple act of lighting a fire to cook a meal can set off a weapon buried underneath. The northeastern province of Xieng-Khouang was one of the most heavily bombed areas of Laos, and it is littered with unexploded munitions. Some residents in the village of Ban Napia have turned this problem into a curious and hazardous occupation: They collect UXO, melt it down in a kiln, and fashion it into spoons and other household items using wooden molds. Villagers in Ban Napia, also known as “Spoon Village,” have made the utensils across decades and generations. The work has not been without its hazards, though: People have been killed collecting and processing the UXO. But for many, the reward is worth the risk, as the trade brings much-needed income to the impoverished region.",Most day tours to Xieng-Khouang's Plain of Jars archaeological site include a stop at the Spoon Village.
72,Ash Jesus and Ash Buddha,Macau,Sculptures of religious figures made from the ashes of pilgrims' incense.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ash-jesus,"Using the resurrected ashes from temple incense in Shanghai, Chinese artist Zhang Huan created the torsos of two of the most prominent religious figures in the world. Standing over 8 feet tall, Ash Jesus and Ash Buddha were recently displayed in Macau. In a kind of religious showdown, the figures were installed facing each other; Jesus with hands outstretched, and Buddha sitting cross-legged, the perfect embodiment of tranquility. These massive sculptures are two of many impressive works of art by Huan that incorporate the ashes of incense carried by pilgrims. Using steel, and wood as a frame, the sculptures were layered in ash, giving them a deathly and eerie look and adding further complexity and symbolism. Huan hoped the figures would show similarities between the Eastern and Western religions, and the two ash deities were shown in as a part of a larger exhibition entitled “East Wind, West Wind.”","This exhibit was a temporary exhibit sponsored by Louis Vuitton at their Flagship store at One Central Mall, NAPE, Macau. - The exhibition ran from April to June 2011 in their special art exhibit, ESpace.

73,Old Protestant Cemetery,Macau,The final resting place of 19th-century sailors previously banned from being buried within Portuguese Macau.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-protestant-cemetery,"Macau, a small peninsula southwest of Hong Kong, is mainly known for its flashy casinos. Dig a bit deeper, and you’ll find a trove of historical treasures hiding among the luxurious hotels and glitzy attractions. For several hundred years, Macau was a colony of Portugal, which left behind distinctive historical and cultural sites. But the Old Protestant Cemetery is unique among Macau’s graveyards, as most of those interred there are neither Portuguese nor Chinese. The Portuguese colonists viewed the peninsula as sacred Roman Catholic ground. As such, they prohibited any Protestants from being buried within the city limits. And on the outside of the city walls, the Chinese refused to allow any foreigners to be laid to rest within the land. This left Protestant sailors and merchants—many from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Northern Europe—in a tough situation. They were forced to bury their dead secretly at night, risking dangerous confrontations with the Chinese officials and left to do nothing but hope that the unsanctioned graves they dug wouldn’t be defaced or destroyed as punishment. In 1821, the non-Catholic, non-local merchants finally gained access to their own burial grounds, thanks to the British East India Company’s decision to buy a plot of land to use as a graveyard. People originally buried outside the city limits were exhumed and reburied at the cemetery. By 1858, the graveyard had already filled. The cemetery closed and a new one was opened, earning this one the title of the Old Protestant Cemetery. You’ll find some interesting graves within the cemetery, including those of the artist George Chinnery and missionary Robert Morrison. You’ll also spot the resting places of many fascinating seamen, including a cabin boy who died of “a fall into the hold.” Keep a particular eye out for the grave that says “Secret to the memory” instead of “Sacred to the memory.”","The cemetery is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. It's located just off the entrance to the lovely Luis de Camões Park, which is also well worth a visit."

The Taipa Houses were built in 1921, to serve as the residences of senior civil servants when the island was a colony of Portugal. (Macau was a Portuguese colony from 1557 until 1999, when the rule was transferred to the People’s Republic of China.) In 1992, the regional government renovated the houses and turned them into a museum. In 2016, the houses became home to the Macanese Living Museum, which includes artistic and cultural artifacts as well as recreations of what these houses looked like when they were initially built.",
75,Batu Caves,"Batu Caves, Malaysia","Holy Hindu shrine in an enormous, monkey-filled limestone cavern.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/batu-caves,"During Thaipusam, an annual celebration of the triumph of good over evil, hundreds of thousands of spiritual pilgrims climb the 272 stairs up into the Batu Caves carrying kavadis, symbolic burdens which include elaborate body piercings. This is the Malaysian version of a Hindu festival celebrated among the Tamil community in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Thaipusam comes from the junction of two words, the Tamil month called “Thai” and a star, named “Pusam.” Observed each year in January or February according to the Tamil calendar, the festival of Thaipusam honors the Hindu god Murugam and his victory over the demon Surapadman with his vel, or lance. Festivalgoers wearing yellow or orange observe traditions including shaving of the head, and carry kavadis representing the fulfillment of vows to Murugam, thanking him for favors done or in advance for future favors sought. The most common kavadis are fruit, flowers, or a pail of milk, but others are as elaborate as heavy peacock-feather covered shrines carried on the head, representing the defeated demon who was transformed into a peacock. The most famous images of the festival are of devotees with cheeks and tongues pierced with ceremonial lances, and others hauling large kavadis with hooks in their backs. The piercings, along with fasting and ritual, induce a trance-like state intended to focus thoughts inward. At the caves a swami removes the piercings, lifting the spiritual burden. Located seven miles north of Kuala Lumpur, the caves were made famous in 1878 by zoologist William Temple Hornaday, better known for the time he put a Pygmy tribesman on display in the monkey house at New York’s Zoological Park. During Malaysia’s colonial heyday, the caves were a popular site for picnicking British couples. The stairs were added in more recent times. The gallery of the main Temple Cave at the top of the stairs is 300 feet high and 1200 feet long, with small openings letting in natural light. A smaller gallery is up another fight of stairs, mostly open to the sky. Two other smaller caves are also at the site. In 2006, a 140-foot tall concrete statue of Murugan was added at the foot of the stairs in the weeks preceding Thaipusam, a giant chrysanthemum garland draped around his shoulders by construction crane. The caves are home to colonies of long tailed-macaque monkeys which roam the stairs and the caves, and have been known to swipe sunglasses, cameras, and snacks from tourists. In 2009, more than a million people visited the caves during Thaipusam.","From Kuala Lumpur, take the KTM commuter train from KL Sentral station to the Batu Caves Station. Batu Caves station is the eighth (8th) station from KL Sentral. You can also take the public bus (11 and 11d). The public buses can be boarded at the Pudu Raya Bus Terminal in Kuala Lumpur. If you're two or more people traveling together, and it isn't a rush hour yet, think of taking Grab taxi, called also ""Asia's Uber.” When looking for something more adventurous make sure to check out tours offered by ""Dark Cave Malaysia"" company, operating on the grounds of the Batu Caves. During these tours you'll have a chance to enter part of the Batu Caves seen only by relatively few. If you are hungry, don't head straight back to the city center. Instead, try South Indian traditional Dhosa at one of the Indian restaurants situated right next to the caves. You can't miss them, since there are always people dining."

Tens of thousands of fireflies will blink in perfect unison for minutes, sometimes hours, at a time. Known as “sychronicity,” it is a somewhat mysterious phenomenon. Even though each firefly flashes according to its own natural rhythm, it also receives feedback from flashing lights nearby. This feedback loop, an example of the mathematical concept known as coupled oscillation, eventually leads to a humongous mass of simultaneously blinking fireflies. One of the best places in the world to see this magnificent display is in Kampung Kuantan, Malaysia. Sadly, over the last ten years the beetle has been disappearing from the region due to poorly managed tourism and river pollution. All is not lost, however. Thriving colonies can still be found in the Bagan Krian mangrove tracts, the Tanjung Piai mangrove regions, and the Cherating and Kemaman shorelines, among other places.",

The climb to the Pinnacle of Gunung Mulu is gruelling and dangerous, so much so that the national park is sometimes used by the Malaysian Army for training. However, those who are daring enough to make the trek to the top of the mountain will be rewarded with one of the most unique and stunning vistas in the world. The tall stone spikes known as the Pinnacles of Gunung Mulu are stark karst formations that were created as the soft limestone eroded away across millennia. Hidden so far up the mountain, the formations are relatively untouched by humankind and the only people to be seen for miles are other pilgrims to the bizarre bit of topography.","It usually takes a couple of days to reach the rock outcropping that serves as a viewing platform for the Pinnacles. Along the way, hikers encounter pitcher plants and toucans along with the grueling terrain. However, ladders and railings have been installed to help with the trek as much as they can. The park at large is also home to a number of large caves that make an excellent accompaniment to a visit to the Pinnacles."

They also contain some of the earliest human remains ever found in Malaysia. The initial excavations into the Niah caves began in 1950s and ’60s when evidence of human habitation in the caves was found, including cave paintings and remains. The remains were found to be a staggering 40,000 years old, meaning the natural caves have been fascinating homo sapiens from cavemen to the camera-happy tourists of today. The cave paintings were found to only be around 1,200 years old, making them nonetheless interesting, but paling in comparison to the ancient bones. Today, the caves are a popular tourist site owing to their awe-inspiring size and natural beauty. The entrance to the main “Great Cave” alone is dozens of meters tall, inviting metaphorical measures such as how many churches or other huge structures could fit in it. No matter how you describe the caves, it is likely that it will be tinged with a sense of wonder.","Before entering the caves, you need to visit the Niah National Park office to purchase a ticket. The caves are about a 40-minute walk from the office. Because the caves are dark and slippery, bring a flashlight and sensible walking shoes."

Constructed in 2005, the steel skybridge is a pedestrian thoroughfare that allowed visitors to take a scenic stroll high above the lush forests of the Gunung Mat Chinchang mountain. After a tram ride to the foot of the bridge, the walkway winds almost leisurely around the very tips of a trio of mountains. The path is suspended over 2,000 feet above sea level by a single massive pylon that trails thick steel cables down to the bridge. The pieces of the over 400-foot bridge were lifted onto the mountain via helicopter and constructed at elevation. It looks both futuristic and almost frighteningly precarious. And as it turns out, these fears might be justified. After being open for a scant few years, it closed in 2012 for renovations and repairs. It partially reopened in February 2015 and is now fully accessible. Hikers can head to the nearby Seven Wells waterfall and hike to the summit of Gunung Mat Chinchang. It’s a tough, but easy to follow trek, that will take you between 1-3 hours one way, depending on your fitness level. The views are totally worth the struggle.","There is no public transport in Langkawi and the place is quite far away (6+ miles) from the most popular areas of the island - Cenang and Kuah.

It has expanded from a small tract of land in Habu to acres of tea-growing sites in Cameron Highlands. The cool climate and the rich soil of this province provide a fertile ground for cultivating tea. The name BOH comes from “Bohea”, the hills in Fujian Province where tea was originally thought to have been discovered. During World War II, the estate was occupied by the Japanese and largely abandoned. After Malaysia declared independence from the British Empire in 1957, many British planters left the country. But the Russels remained in Malaysia, and the company grew as they acquired several other tea farming operations. Today, at over 8,000 acres, the BOH tea plantation is the largest in Southeast Asia.

The playhouse has also been used as an event space for performances and exhibitions. The design also features raised square platforms set at various levels to create different dimensions across the open structure. Jamil took her inspiration from traditional structures called wakafs, which serve as resting places for village communities in Malaysia. Contemporary architectural designs made of bamboo are a rare sight in Malaysia, but the playhouse is a creative example of how the sustainable material can be used in fun new ways for other structures.

It’s home to some of the city’s biggest and most expensive shopping malls and restaurants as well as the street food mecca of Jalan Alor. Jalan Alor is one of the best-known jalans, or roads, of the district. Some of these were known for the same unsavory characteristics many major city back alleys throughout the world are known for. But in the late 2010s, Kuala Lumpur City Hall decided to transform these streets into art projects. Most of the murals that now decorate Bukit Bintang’s most infamous jalans were started in mid-2018 and completed in December of that year. A majority of the artwork in these central alleys dividing Bukit Bintang’s major city blocks comes in the form of painted murals with bright colors and natural imagery like rivers, rainforests, and tropical Southeast Asian fauna. A more novelty art type on display here are neon sculptures of cartoony cloud silhouettes that float above the street and light up at nighttime. One of the most notable natural inspirations to this arts district is the water stream painted on the floor, following the path of an actual stream that once flowed through Jalan Alor. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like Kuala Lumpur’s City Hall has released the names of the artists that designed and/or worked on this transformation. Perhaps this was not an oversight but rather by design, to emphasize the anonymous, self-less ideal of projects meant for the greater good.","While the jalans have been beautified, they are still back alleys in a major city’s tourist district, so take the usual caution when wandering through them, especially at night. The most-decorated alleyways are Jalans Alor, Berangan, Changkat, Rembia and Tengkat Tong Shin, but many other murals can be found in Bukit Bintang."
86,Kuching Cat Museum,"Kuching, Malaysia","Two thousand feline artifacts fill Malaysia's ""Cat City.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuching-cat-museum,"Tracing the history of cats back 5,000 years, the Kuching Cat Museum houses 2,000 different artifacts, ranging from a mummified Egyptian cat to strange cat headstones. Although the Cat Museum is a mix of serious historical exhibits along with kitsch you might find in a cheap Chinatown bodega, it takes its work analyzing the history of cats very seriously. For centuries, Southeast Asia has had a history with cats, documented in great detail at the Cat Museum. Interestingly enough, Kuching actually means cat, making the location of the museum all the more apt. Besides stuffed cats, porcelain cats, and gigantic fang doorways, the museum also recounts bizarre superstitions around the animal, like nearly drowning a cat in order to bring rain. Outside of superstitious near-cat abuse, cat lovers should take solace in some of the more approachable exhibits, like Felis Badia, the rarest cat in the world, of which the museum is in possession of the only stuffed specimen.","The museum is open Monday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. To get there, either take CityLink Bus no.

87,Snake Island of Borneo,"Kuala Penyu, Malaysia",This tiny island in the South China Sea is crawling with venomous sea snakes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snake-island-of-borneo,"Pulau Tiga Park encompasses 158 square kilometers of open ocean containing three islands that were formed by mud volcano eruptions in the late 19th century. While the largest island (Tiga) is known for its natural volcanic mud baths, the smallest island (Kalampunian Damit) boasts an attraction that is far less relaxing but perhaps a bit more fascinating: lots and lots of deadly snakes. An isolated rock covered with tall silver Pisonia trees, the calm pale surroundings of Kalampunian Damit — also known as Snake Island — stand in stark contrast to the community of wild serpents that call the island home. Known as yellow-lipped sea kraits or banded sea kraits, the venomous sea snakes spend their nights hunting deep waters for eels and small fish, returning to land by day to digest and get some sleep. Individual kraits tend to have one specific home island to which they return, forming a constant and fairly stable population. They also use their home base as a breeding ground, meaning Kalampunian Damit tends to be particularly snakey during mating season. While banded sea kraits are considerably more poisonous than cobras, they are also fairly reclusive and non-aggressive and bite humans only in rare occasions where they are harassed or trod upon — which can admittedly be easy to do on a tiny island full of snakes, but as long as visitors watch their step they are in little danger. Being somewhat off the beaten path, Pulau Tiga Park sees few visitors, and is most famous for being the shooting location of the first season of Survivor.","Getting to the island is easy and just requires a booking set with an agent who will take you to Kuala Penyu Town, where a direct boat will leave from the jetty."

89,Snake Temple,"Bayan Lepas, Malaysia","Come in, light some incense, and ignore the live snakes around you.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/penang-snake-temple,"Worshippers regularly visit this beautiful temple, located just under two miles away from Penang Island’s airport. However, the gorgeous place of worship has a unique catch: It’s filled with live pit vipers. The Snake Temple (officially known as Hock Hin Keong or Cheng Hoon Giam) was built in the mid-19th century to honor Chor Soo Kong, also known as Qingshui, a Buddhist monk and healer born in China during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The legend holds that during his lifetime, Chor Soo Kong sometimes offered shelter to local jungle snakes. After the temple was erected in his honor, it’s said snakes began showing up there of their own accord. Snakes aside, the temple is a beautiful piece of architecture. In its earliest years it was a simple attap structure, a traditional housing style found in the rural villages of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. But after decades of improvements and several major renovations, it has blossomed into a magnificent structure, featuring intricate detailing on the doors and rafter beams. The main temple opens into a courtyard, where the Shrine Hall of Kuan Yin is located, allowing visitors to marvel at the beautiful plants that populate the garden. Follow the pathway and you will arrive at the “snake pool,” where snakes recline on trees among leafy green branches, either basking in the sun or taking refuge in the shade. The snakes are thought to be kept docile thanks to incense being constantly burned. Locals will also tell you that many of the snakes in question, which are Wagler’s pit vipers and green tree snakes, have been de-venomed. Still, you’ll want keep your hands and feet to yourself at all times, and look around before you sit. It’s not recommended to bring small children, but the temple is a tranquil spot and they claim that no one has ever been bitten.","The temple is located about a 25-minute drive from downtown Penang, so either get a taxi, or catch the free shuttle bus. There is not much else around the temple, so consider trying to fit this in before or after the airport. On your way to the courtyard, you can also visit the exhibition next to the temple, which includes pythons and cobras. While entry to the temple is free, you do have to pay for a photo opportunity with these snakes. This is completely optional."

92,Nepenthes Rajah: The King of the Pitcher Plants,"Kota Belud, Malaysia",These rat eating Giant Malaysian Pitcher Plants may have evolved to eat shrew poop.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nepenthes-rajah-the-king-of-the-pitcher-plants,"When pitcher plants were first seen by botanist and explorer Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1859, he described them as “one of the most striking vegetable productions hither-to discovered,” but it wasn’t until 1862 that someone first noticed just how unusual these plants really were. Nepenthes rajah is the largest of the pitcher plants, and it’s also the largest carnivorous plant in the world, sometimes referred to as the “king of the pitcher plants.” It is essentially a trap filled with up to three and half liters of water and two and a half liters of digestive fluid. It is evolved to lure insects to it, and when the insects fall in they are unable to escape and are digested by the plant. While insects, particularly ants, are by far the main staple of the Giant Malaysian Pitcher Plant (aka the Rajah Brooke’s Pitcher Plant, aka the King of Nepenthes, aka Nepenthes rajah), occasionally the large plants catch bigger prey. On a number of occasions rats have been found half-digested inside the pitchers, and other small vertebrates such as small birds, lizards, and frogs occasionally fall victim to the plants as well. This and one other pitcher plant, the N. rafflesiana, are the only plants known to catch mammalian prey. Among other unusual traits of the plant is a peculiar relationship with local shrews, one that may in fact be the origin of their large size. The plants have evolved to entice and attract tree shrews. The shape and size of the pitcher plants forces the shrews — who want to mark their feeding territory — to defecate directly into the plants’ cups, providing them with valuable nitrogen. And while it is rare for the plants to catch rats and mice, shrews poop in them all the time. This beneficial relationship between the pitcher plants and small mammals depositing feces into them may in fact be a driving factor behind the evolution of these the largest pitcher plants.",

97,B-24 Liberator Wreck at Gunung Telapak Buruk,"Kuala Klawang, Malaysia","The remains of this RAF plane and its crew were lost for decades, nearly engulfed by the Malaysian jungle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/b24-liberator-wreck-gunung-telapak-buruk,"On a rainforested mountaintop in Malaysia, not far from Kuala Lumpur, lies the wreckage of a Royal Air Force B-24 Liberator. World War II had ended only a few days before the British aircraft disappeared, lost while dropping supplies for resistance fighters in the remote jungles of Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. It was more than a thousand miles from its base in the Cocos Islands. Less than a week after the surrender of Japan, a crew of eight was sent on a mission to the Malay Peninsula to drop supplies, search for POW camps, and perhaps to even drop leaflets announcing the end of the War. There was no distress signal, no indication of trouble—but the plane disappeared, thought to have gone down in the ocean. Forty six years later, a remote wreckage site was reported by local Orang Asli tribesmen. The wreck may have first been spotted in the 1950s, but those reports are sketchy and, if true, were never acted on. (At the time, fear of an ambush by Communist insurgents may have been a factor.) When the locals came to the authorities in 1991, it was thought the plane might be the missing RAF tail# KL654/R, but expeditions to examine the site didn’t begin until 2006. In 2009, British and Malaysian volunteers excavated the area, uncovering the remains and some personal effects of the eight-man crew. In 2012 they were laid to rest at a special ceremony at the Cheras War Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur. The wreck, while spread over a large area, is well preserved, including sections of the wings, the fuselage, the engine, and even some faint markings. Although located in thick virgin jungle, it’s a popular destination for hiking groups. There is abundant wildlife, including siamang gibbons, and—although the species has been declared extinct on the Peninsula—Sumatran rhinos have been rumored to check the site out too.","The wreck is located on the mountain called Gunung Telapak Buruk, about an hour’s drive south of Kuala Lumpur. There are two hiking routes to the wreck, the northern route is shorter, but requires a four wheel drive to get to the trail head (this is the position marked here). The southern route is longer and more challenging – about a 20 kilometre round trip through rugged terrain crossing Gunung Berembun, and the trail starts near the village of Kampung Pantai Baharu. There are several hiking groups that arrange visits to the site, and the trail itself, once located, is well marked and regularly used."
98,Cheong Fatt Tze's Blue Mansion,"George Town, Malaysia","Once the private home of China’s most legendary tycoon, getting inside this stunning mansion no longer requires an elite pedigree or acts of daring.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cheong-fatt-tze-blue-mansion,"In the 1880s, with a career in full ascent, diplomat and merchant Cheong Fatt Tze (aka “the Rockefeller of the East”) took a political appointment in Penang and built a home that continues to put all others in George Town to shame. The “Blue Mansion,” as it’s known today, has 38 rooms, hundreds of windows, seven staircases (one imported from Scotland), five courtyards, porches lined with cast iron detailing so fine that it resembles lace, and gables inlaid with bright porcelain mosaics. Its architecture is most unique for the period, in that it bucked the trend of looking to the Anglo-Indian style, looking to the Southern Chinese courtyard homes of the Su Chow dynasty as touchstones instead. Again, in choosing a color to diffuse Penang’s soporific heat, Cheong Fatt Tze picked his heritage over what was popular at the time; blue prevailed, as white is traditionally the color of death in Chinese culture. Cheong Fatt Tze lived in the house when business kept him in Penang, though he was often called away. The Blue Mansion became more of a family property, and it was noted that his seventh wife was particularly fond of the home. Regardless, when Cheong passed away in 1916, his will specified that the home remain a family property, and a sum of money was set aside to maintain it in perpetuity. It took very little time before these funds were mismanaged. The building fell quickly into disrepair, leading to squatters taking up residencies in some of the mansion’s more remote, disused wings. With the death of Cheong Fatt Tze’s last son in 1989, the crumbling property was put on the market. A group of well-intentioned locals beat out bigger development firms to secure its purchase and restoration on the building began shortly thereafter. Today the mansion, restored to its former glory, has been reborn as a UNESCO-recognized hybrid museum-bed and breakfast. 16 rooms are available to stay in overnight, while historical tours of the manor are offered to guests and the general public alike three times daily, making a magnate’s opulence accessible to all.",
99,National Textile Museum,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",An exploration of Malaysian heritage through the lens of traditional textiles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-textile-museum,"Housed within a striking landmark building designed in the Indo-Saracenic Revival style, the National Textile Museum in Kuala Lumpur is dedicated to the very fabric of Malaysian culture. Behind the pink-striped exterior of the former Federated Malay States Railways building, the museum is comprised of four galleries spread across two floors. They trace the history and significance of Malaysian textiles through the exhibition of traditional modes of dress, and by charting the evolution of textile-producing technology. The Pohon Budi or “Tree of Life” gallery introduces visitors to the ancient origins of textile production and trade. This gallery spotlights prominent Malaysian textiles such as the songket (a silk sarong interwoven with gilded thread), keringkam (a kind of gold embroidery typically seen in headscarves worn by women in the Malaysian state of Sarawak), pua kumbu (a colorful, patterned cloth reserved for Iban ceremonies), and linangkit (a kind of decorative embroidery that adorns the skirts of Lotud women). The gallery also maps out the tools and techniques used to create these textiles. The Pelangi Gallery is named after a multicolored cloth worn by various ethnic groups across Malaysia. This rainbow fabric is said to symbolize Malaysia’s colorful heritage, and showcases the ways in which different communities style and adorn this national textile. The Teluk Berantai Gallery refers to the floral motif featured in Malaysian songkets. The pattern is associated with Malaysian unity, though different groups have cultivated their own aesthetic versions of it; from tekatan (embroidered gold on raised velvet) to kain limar (a silk panel draped over the songket). Lastly, the Ratna Sari Gallery focuses on the exquisite finishing touches that complement Malaysian costumes: jewels and accessories made from gems, metals, and gold. The term Ratna Sari refers specifically to the traditional jewelry crafted by Malaysian artisans of yore, and which incorporates Chinese, Indian, and Malay details.",The National Textile Museum is open every day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is 5 Malaysian ringgits (about $1.20) for foreigners. The museum is about a 15-minute walk from the Masjid Jamek station in Kuala Lumpur.
100,Penang Jewish Cemetery,"George Town, Malaysia",The oldest Jewish cemetery in Southeast Asia is a monument to a disappearing community.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/penang-jewish-cemetery,"Tucked away behind high, unkempt walls on the side of a busy road that feels worlds away from the charming shophouse streets of tourist-friendly George Town, it’s easy to miss the Jewish Cemetery (despite the name printed in English on its gates). If the gates appear locked, a visitor need only knock or shout; the proprietor will soon be out to open them, and give you a brief tour, from the oldest grave, erected in 1835, to the newest, erected in 2011. Upon first entering the cemetery, the graves—formed of long, low triangles or domes similar to ossuaries found in the Middle East—appear to be unmarked. But if you walk around to the other side you can find inscriptions. Most are in Hebrew, a few accompanied by English translations. Nearly all are hidden in small alcoves on the side of the casket-like grave stones, facing away from the entrance. A few small glass pebbles and several stones mark the graves, demonstrating that the memory of those interred here lives on, despite the fact that (according to the proprietor) the last ethnic Jew on the island of Penang is already lying here, a man who died in 2011. When asked if there were still any jews living in Penang, he replies laconically, “There used to be many—but now there are none at all.” The absence may be keenly felt by the traveller to this lonely alcove. Checking the guestbook, it seems that the cemetery often goes days or weeks without a single guest. Those that have made the pilgrimage leave names and countries from all over the world. There are even a few entires in Hebrew. Sadly, Penang’s only synagogue, dating back to 1929, was unable to support a minyan (a group of 10 or more adult Jews, traditionally men), and closed down in 1976, leaving the Jewish Cemetery as the last trace of the community. Even the street it stands next to, once called Yahudi Road, or “Jewish Street,” has since been renamed Jalan Zainal Abidin.","The only entrance is via the gate on the main, northern stretch of Jalan Zainal Abidin road. The parts that border the alleyway of the same name to the south are made inaccessible by high stone walls."
101,Sarawak Museum,"Kuching, Malaysia",The oldest museum in Borneo is a cornucopia of rare taxidermy and human skulls.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarawak-museum,"Contained in Borneo’s oldest museum is not only some rare historical taxidermy, but also an exhibit that remembers the historic (if barbaric) culture of headhunting. In 1891, the second White Rajah of Sarawak, Charles Brooke began construction works on what would be the oldest museum in Borneo. This plan came after some nudging from his friend and famous British naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, who had been exploring the Malay Archipelago, collecting specimens for study at the time. The Victorian period architecture, designed after a Normandy town hall, survived through the Japanese Occupation in Malaya (1941 – 1945) during World War II. It had the good fortune to fall under the protection of a Japanese officer, which is why the museum suffered very little damage and looting. A lucky thing too because the natural history collection housed in this museum is regarded as one of the finest in Southeast Asia, which dates back to the dynastic English monarchy of the Brooke family (1841 – 1946). On the ground floor of the Sarawak Museum, you’ll find taxidermied exhibits frozen in time in their wood and glass display case, ever watchful of the many visitors who had walked through the Natural History gallery for decades. They had seen the world changed, although the exhibits themselves remained the same, if not somewhat disintegrating a little as time goes by. A great deal of the collection comes from the Brooke Era, where the taxidermy procedures had been done not in Sarawak, but all the way in Britain. This preservation took place in the 1800s, so delivery by sea took about three months each way yet the fragile shipments remarkably managed to arrive at their destinations without harm. Case in point would be the Orangutan exhibit. As the story goes, the first Rajah of Sarawak, James Brooke, shot two Orangutans during a hunt. He had both packed in ice, shipped to Britain to be taxidermied and mounted, and later shipped back to the Sarawak Museum. Today, this exhibit, along with others from that era have remained as they were in the Natural History gallery. This gallery is home to various taxidermied specimens including primates, avians, felines, and rodents found in Borneo. The natural history collection is not the sole appeal of the Sarawak Museum however. The first floor features ethnographical artifacts of indigenous peoples of Sarawak, including a wide collection of traditional ceremonial masks from different tribal groups. Among the local culture, carved wooden masks are worn by the spirit doctors of a tribe and different masks serve different ritualistic purposes. They can be used to celebrate a good harvest or for spiritual ceremonies like exorcising evil spirits from a victim’s body. The museum’s collection contains mainly masks from the Iban, a tribal subgroup of the Dayak people of Sarawak. Ceremonial masks come with varied expressions, and some are even implanted with actual human hair as facial hair. Also on the first floor is a model longhouse built to depict the traditional living spaces of the historic Dayak people. In previous eras, the Dayaks practiced headhunting, and human skulls would be preserved and installed in longhouses, believing that the trophies would bring a good harvest and fertility to the community. The replica community hut is adorned with its own human skulls. Of course, the practice of headhunting has long been eradicated since the days of the White Rajahs. No need to lose your head worrying over it when visiting Sarawak today. However, maintenance of the heads is not to be taken lightly, even to this day, for as long as human skulls are present in a longhouse there are rules and rituals to follow. The heads need regular food offerings and a constant fire lit beneath them. Failure to do so would anger the spirits of the heads, and this only spells bad omens to the inhabitants of the longhouse. Just to be safe, don’t mess with the heads. Update as of February 2020: The museum is closed for renovations, but there are plans for it to reopen sometime in 2020.",

The Peranakan, also known as the Baba Nyonya in Penang, are largely the descendants of Chinese men who came to the Malay archipelago centuries ago and married local Malay women. During the colonial era, they mainly engaged in trade and business, making them extremely wealthy in both currency and exposure to other cultures. Their opulent homes speak to the wealth and high status they enjoyed. The Pinang Peranakan Mansion is a particularly exquisite example of their culture, which has begun to decline in Malaysia and Singapore. The Pinang Peranakan Mansion belonged to Chung Keng Quee, who was among the wealthiest residents of Penang in the late 1800s. His fortune was derived mainly from his businesses in mining. His mansion was built in a style unique within this part of the world, as it’s an eclectic mix of Chinese and European design elements. Today, it serves as a museum dedicated to Peranakan culture. Inside, a large collection of furniture, silverware, dresses, decorations, collectibles, and appliances is kept on display.

104,Kundasang War Memorial,"Ranau, Malaysia",Four distinctly unique gardens commemorate the POWs who lost their lives during the Sandakan Death Marches of 1945.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kundasang-war-memorial,"“I’m dreaming of Australia, the land we left behind…” These are the despairing words carved into black stone at the Kundasang War Memorial and Gardens, one of the first memorials created to remember the victims of the Sandakan Death Marches of 1945. Over 1,000 Australian and British Prisoners of War perished in Sandakan, Malaysia during the three death marches from the Sandakan POW Camp to Ranau, Malaysia during World War II. A mere 6 men survived, all of them Australian soldiers who had escaped. The memorial was built to commemorate both the victims of the marches themselves and the people of North Borneo who risked or lost their lives to help the POWs by hiding escapees from the Japanese and feeding them until the war ended. The death marches are considered to be the single most atrocious calamity to ever be endured by Australian servicemen during the World War, and three Japanese commanders were eventually tried and put to death for the war crimes. In 1962 the memorial was erected, and it’s a calm and peaceful place to visit despite being located behind a bustling farmers’ market. The gardens are made up of four sections, one for each distinctly different homeland and culture of those who lost their lives, and one for contemplation. There is an Australian Garden, an English Garden, a Borneo Garden, and a Contemplation Garden and Pool. If you visit the memorial you are welcome to watch a video and learn more about the death marches, but if you don’t have the stomach for it you can simply smell the roses of the English Garden, admire the orchids of Borneo, run your fingers across the smooth white pebbles of Kundasang in the Australian Garden, or go to the pool and contemplate the sacrifices, sadness, and all-too-human fallacies of war.","Kundasang is located 90 km, approximately 2 hours by automobile, from the capital of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu.

105,Wat Chaiya Mangkalaram,"George Town, Malaysia",Giant relaxing Buddha in Malaysia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-chaiya-mangalaram-buddhist-temple-penang-malaysia,"When enlightenment is reached, the feeling is completely sublime and without trouble. Worries simply drift away into a calmer state of being. This Buddhist ethos is perfectly portrayed in Wat Chaiya Mangkalaram, a temple with a giant reclining Buddha. Unlike monuments to other spiritual figures, the Buddha is not supposed to create feelings of sadness or loss. Instead, the 100-foot-long golden Buddha is meant to inspire, showing all of those who follow in his path the supreme happiness achieved from nirvana. Sprawled across the entire temple, the Buddha is slightly smiling and natural light shimmers off of his gold and white finish. Wat Chaiya Mangkalaram is actually a Thai temple, and is not directly connected to Malaysia in origin. The temple was built in 1845 by a Thai monk, and has been a location of serious Buddhist devotion since. Many of the most devoted to the temple have had their ashes placed in niches behind the massive Buddha statue. There they rest and accompany the smiling and tranquil Buddha after their death.",

108,Bukit Cina (Chinese Hill),"Malacca, Malaysia",The largest Chinese cemetery in the world outside of China dates back to the 15th century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bukit-cina-chinese-hill,"In the midst of urban Malacca, a 820,000 square foot (250,000-square-metre) hill provides a verdant, peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. This entire hillside is a Chinese graveyard, allegedly the largest outside of China, with over 12,000 graves, some of which date to the Middle Ages. In the mid-15th century, Hang Li Po, daughter of the Chinese Ming Emperor, was sent to be married to the sultan of Malacca, Mansur Shah. The couple established their residence on the hillside, later dubbed Bukit Cina, or Chinese Hill. Though there were Malaysian elements to the estate, it was overrun by the princess and her 500-person entourage, so its culture and design were overwhelmingly Chinese. After Mansur Shah’s reign ended, the forested Bukit Cina was razed by Portuguese missionaries, who established a monastery atop the hill in 1581. It was officially designated a Chinese cemetery by the Kapitan Cina (a Dutch-appointed colonial official charged with governing the Chinese population) in 1685. There were some previous burials, including members of Hang Li Po’s party and a prominent warrior who died during conflict between the Portuguese and Indonesian Acehnese invaders. Thousands of Chinese who died in Malaysia would join them in the centuries to come. By the 20th century, the cemetery had fallen out of use and had become overgrown. In 1984, when local government announced it would be developing housing and commercial property on Bukit Cina, it was met with public outcry. Hundreds of Chinese Malaysians came out to protect their ancestral history, and the cemetery was left alone. Today, Bukit Cina is open to the public as a park. Its forested paths have become a popular spot for walks and jogs among the medieval graves. A Chinese World War II memorial can be found on the property, as well as temples and wells built by Sultan Mansur Shah. The best-known is the Hang Li Po Well, built specifically for the princess but used by the public, which is now treated as a wishing well.",Bukit Cina can be accessed by foot from many points within downtown Malacca.

Located within Gomantong Hill, the cave system is made up of two primary chambers, the Black Cave and the White Cave. A number of species live within the large, 300-foot-tall caverns including swiftlets, whose highly valued nests (bird’s nest soup, anyone?) are collected by locals via precarious bamboo ladders and poles. There are also hundreds of thousands of Wrinkle Lipped Free-tailed bats living in the upper reaches of the cave. Their nightly exodus from the cave mouth is a popular site for visitors. What is less popular, at least for those looking for unvarnished rain forest beauty, is the hundred foot tall pile of guano that has developed inside the cave. The giant pile of sh… uprisingly lively dung has attracted a teeming population of cockroaches and parasites. There are so many roaches in the caves that they can be seen climbing the walls in droves, making the cave a truly creepy dive. The cave can be accessed by a wooden walkway that leads visitors down into the bat-and-roach-infested wonderland. The question is, do you have the stomach for it?",

111,Antong Coffee Mill,"Taiping, Malaysia",Malaysia's oldest coffee roaster is also a historical landmark.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antong-coffee-mill,"You might put sugar in your coffee. In Malaysia, though, the beans for a traditional cup are roasted with not just sugar but margarine as well, before they’re ground-up and brewed. The result is a strong, caramelly cup of coffee. Despite the global trend of chrome-plated cafés and high-tech coffee roasters, there’s still lots of demand for old-school kopi. Perhaps that’s why Antong Coffee Mill, Malaysia’s oldest roaster, is still in business. Not only does the mill make the old-fashioned coffee, it makes it the old-fashioned way, over wood-fired stoves. It’s an unusual enough sight in this day and age that the factory has become a tourist destination, with curious onlookers coming to see the traditional way of making their favorite coffee. The mill is open for visitors everyday, and many come to buy different roasts or to sip a coffee sample or two. Some visitors, though, don’t come for coffee at all. The mill operates out of the historical home of Chen Cuifen, a “forgotten revolutionary.” Chen was the lover of Sun Yat Sen, the leader who ushered China into its brief period of democracy in the early 1900s. Sen is considered a heroic figure across the Chinese diaspora, and he’s said to have stayed with Chen here on occasion. There’s even a statue of him out front. When Chen moved back to China, she rented and then sold the property to Tiah Ee Mooi, the founder of the mill. The mill contains many artifacts of its coffee-making history, as well as objects and information about the life of Chen Cuifen.","The shop and mill typically both open at 8:30 every day, though tours through the mill stop at 12:30."
112,Royal Malaysian Police Museum,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",This surprising museum tells the story of modern Malaysia through the history of its law enforcement.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/royal-malaysian-police-museum,"It’s fair to say that most travelers don’t get too excited when they see a police museum; it’s kind of a niche thing. But if you’re in Kuala Lumpur, it’s worth paying a visit to the Royal Malaysian Police Museum, arguably one of the best small museums in the Malaysian capital. As the name suggests, the museum tells the history of the Malaysian police, from pre-colonial times through British rule and up to the present day. But rather than presenting a staid, celebratory history of its police force, the museum uses the history of the country’s law enforcement agencies—and those they fought against—to tell the colorful story of Malaysia itself. The museum is divided into three spaces. Gallery A takes us back to pre-colonial times, where paintings and weapons tell the story of the Malacca Sultanate and its downfall. Then we have the Temenggong—the sultan’s personal bodyguard—who was also in charge of the state police. It then moves on to the British colonial era and the very earliest forms of the modern police force, with uniforms and traditional weaponry on display, including the asymmetrical kris dagger. Gallery B shows the development of the modern police force, mainly through the tools and everyday items used by the evolving Royal Malaysia Police (RMP). Artifacts include old police typewriters, helmets, notebooks, and buttons. There are also models of police vehicles, and an armory filled with official police firearms, including revolvers, rifles, automatic weapons and grenades. And some of the most colorful items come from the bad guys: knuckledusters and knives used by criminal clans, and swords and sticks used by the triads. Gallery C deals with more recent emergencies faced by Malaysia and the RMP. These include the Bukit Kepong incident of 1950, an armed encounter between police and gunmen of the Malayan Communist Party during the Malayan Emergency. Fourteen officers were killed, along with 40 Communist gunmen. The museum’s largest exhibits, meanwhile, are located outside. Here you’ll find various police vehicles, including a Sankey AT-105 armored car, a Shorland armored patrol vehicle, a GMC armored personnel carrier, and a patrol boat. And for train fans there’s an armored Wickham trolley, a railway personnel carrier converted to hold five police personnel to guard the railway tracks between 1953 and 1960.","The Royal Malaysian Police Museum is located about a 5-minute walk from the Kuala Lumpur train station, not far from the Planetarium Negara, the Islamic Arts Museum, and the Masjid Negara. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (but closes on Fridays between 12.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. for Friday prayers). Entrance is free."
113,A Famosa,"Malacca, Malaysia","Built by the Portuguese colonists in the early 16th century, this fort is one of the oldest European structure in Asia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/a-famosa,"The city of Malacca was conquered by the Portuguese in 1511. To suppress the attacks of the Malacca Sultanate, they immediately started the constructions of temporary camps, as well as the main stronghold called the Fortaleza de Malaca, now better known as A Famosa. The Portuguese took around five months to complete the buildings. Many of the laborers died from the scorching heat and shortage of food. For a little more than a century afterwards, the Portuguese controlled the port city and its spice trade from A Famosa. The Dutch East India Company, desiring power in the East, sought to destroy Portuguese colonies in the early 17th century. Following a series of small incursions and skirmishes, the Dutch conquered Malacca in 1641 with the help of local allies. By this time, the invasion had caused more than 7,000 casualties. The Dutch rule lasted for 183 years, during which the city saw relative peace thanks to the treaty between them and the Sultanate of Johor. When Napoleon’s army invaded Holland in 1795, the Dutch allowed the British to take control of Malacca without any battle. The British had little interest in keeping it, however, and they destroyed the A Famosa fortress in 1807 along with most of the city. It is partially preserved today, including the gate, sewage system and defensive walls, as well as a reconstruction of its watchtower. Its name, which means “famous” in Portuguese, is often mispronounced even by local Malaysians. The misinterpretation is that it is pronounced as /ei/ Famosa, as if the Portuguese word a is the same as the letter A in English, but its more accurate pronunciation is /a/ Famosa, almost like, “uh!”",

Sentul Depot initially started off as an engineering workshop in the early 1900s, where around 5,000 engineers would come for work each day. When World War II began, Sentul was one of the last towns in the country to be bombed by the Allied Forces. Though initially partially rebuilt thereafter and resumed as a workshop by KTM (Keretapi Tanah Melayu, or Malaysia’s local rail services provider), Sentul Depot never regained its former charms and glory, before eventually settling down as a shelter for decommissioned locomotives. Fast forward to today, the once-dilapidated historical site has since been rejuvenated as one of the top spots for the city’s ever-evolving modern lifestyle destinations. Sentul Depot is now home to plenty of rustic-yet-refreshing architecture, food and drink booths offering local delicacies with slight twists, as well as a substantial event space showcasing occasional local performances and bazaars.",
115,Hang Jebat Mausoleum,"Malacca, Malaysia",A mausoleum dedicated to a warrior felled by misplaced loyalty and tragic circumstances.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hang-jebat-mausoleum,"Visitors strolling down a residential street off Malacca’s bustling historical downtown will notice a quiet graveyard tucked among the houses. The graveyard is small and unassuming, save for a few informational signs toward the back. These grounds hold the tomb of Hang Jebat, one of Malacca’s most infamous characters, whose undying loyalty to the wrong person was his downfall. According to several sources of literature, Hang Jebat began his career as one of Malacca’s most legendary warriors. Hang Jebat was part of a group of five established fighters, along with his best friends Hang Tuah, Hang Kasturi, Hang Lekir, and Hang Lekiu. Hang Tuah in particular was famed throughout the region for his martial skills as a silat master, and earned many accolades and titles in service of Sultan Mansur Shah during the 15th century. Hang Tuah’s meteoric rise to fame earned him his fair share of jealous rivals, with one rival eventually conspiring to bring the famed fighter down. Rumors circulated around the palace that Hang Tuah had indulged in adultery with one of the sultan’s court stewardesses, an illegal act that would have dire consequences. Furious, the sultan sentenced Hang Tuah to death without ordering a proper trial. But unbeknownst to anyone, not even Hang Tuah’s closest friends, the bendahara (chief minister) Tun Perak decided not to carry out the death sentence. Fearing the wrath of the people, the bendahara spirited Hang Tuah away to a cave, where the legendary warrior would be safe from further plotting. Out of grief for his friend, and in retaliation for what he considered an unjust murder, Hang Jebat rebelled by running amok in the villages. Sources differ on what exactly happened, but the stories all agree that Hang Jebat’s revenge led him to injure and kill scores of people, with the sultan’s forces unable to restrain him. The sultan came to regret Hang Tuah’s death sentence, and upon his lament, the loyal Tun Perak immediately revealed Hang Tuah’s survival. It was a widespread belief that only Hang Tuah could stop his friend from hurting more people, so he was immediately recalled and given full amnesty for his supposed crime. The price for the pardon: He had to kill his best friend Hang Jebat. When confronted by his friend, Hang Jebat explained that he had rebelled to demonstrate his loyalty to Hang Tuah and express his anger at the sultan’s unjust sentence, but the damage was done. Hang Tuah could not accept this explanation, as Hang Jebat’s actions had put him in direct revolt, and above all, Hang Tuah was unquestionably loyal to his sultan. Legend has it that the two skilled warriors fought for seven days, with Hang Tuah eventually gaining the upper hand and slaying his closest companion. Today, Hang Jebat’s mausoleum is tucked away among sleepy shophouses and located at the back of the small cemetery. Make your journey to the end of the street, where you can peek into the almost-forgotten graveyard, the final resting place of one of Malacca’s finest warriors, doomed forever to play the role of the villain.",

From the tip of the plaza, there is an excellent view of the Kuha bay. Dataran Lang is decorated with miniature fountains, terraces, and bridges, making it the ideal spot to take a couple of photos. The eagle was constructed to serve as a symbol for the island. According to local legends, the name of the island came from two Malay words – helang (Eagle) and kawi (reddish-brown), hence the name lang-kawi. The island is the largest of those that make up the Langkawi archipelago and is situated less than 20 miles from the coast of Malaysia, very near its border with Thailand.

In order to tie everything together properly, huge, sophisticated devices for converting AC into DC and back again were necessary. Typically, these machines are installed in a large hall with the appearance of other electrical equipment facilities, which is to say, those that are not very opulent or eye-catching. The hall of Gurun, which sites at the end of the Malaysian powerline, is designed like a Chinese temple, and is an exception to the rule. If it weren’t surrounded by high-voltage electrical equipment and powerlines, you would think that the hall of Gurun served as a place for prayer. The hall - and the powerlines it ties together - went into service in June 2002. The HVDC connection is a monopolar overhead line with a maximum transmission rate of 300 megawatts. Thailand and Malaysia have long enjoyed close cooperation, particularly in the energy sector, which has significantly contributed to the enjoy security and development of both nations. Among those cooporative efforts is the interconnection of transmission networks. The interconnection, which represents the first cross-border DC link in the ASEAN region is an important steppingstone to the realization of the ASEAN power grid which will significantly enhance the greater energy security and economic integration of the region.",

Upon returning from battle, Wan Darus accused Mahsuri of infidelity, something she vehemently denied. Mahsuri was tied to a tree for days while maintaining her innocence, but none of the islanders believed her. On the day of her execution, they tried many ways of killing her but nothing would puncture her skin. She finally told them to kill her with her father’s ceremonial keris, a type of dagger. When they stabbed her, white blood flowed from Mahsuri’s wound, signifying her innocence. With her final dying breath, Mahsuri cursed the island of Langkawi for seven generations.

Originally built by the British colonial government, the prison was notorious for its harsh environment, only equipped with small cells and a contaminated water supply system drawn from an old well in a cemetery, which caused a cholera outbreak in 1895. During the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945, the prison was used to incarcerate Allied POWs. After the war, it housed many death-row prisoners and drug offenders, who were often caned and executed. In 1984, an inmate created what would be recognized by the Guinness World Records as the world’s longest mural at the time, depicting a rainforest scene. Eventually, the prison’s facilities became outdated and plans were made to demolish it in phases to make space for redevelopment. The project was finally initiated in 2009, demolishing all of the prison complexes by 2012. Almost all of it, that is. For a long time, there was a debate about whether the prison should be preserved as a heritage site or not, considering its nature. In the end, it was settled that only its gate should remain, and it continues to stand there, even after everything else has changed.

Now known as Perigi Raja, the King’s Well, or Hang Li Poh’s Well, this well became a significant source of water for the city-state and it is said that it has never dried up even during the worst droughts. Legend has it that whoever throws coins into the well is destined to return to Malacca. After conquering the city in 1511, the Portuguese took control of the well. In silent resistance, warriors of the Sultan of Malacca poisoned the well and succeeded in covertly killing some 200 Portuguese colonizers. The Dutch and later the Acehnese, an Indigenous people from Indonesia, also poisoned the well in 1606 and between 1628 and 1629 respectively. During Dutch control of the region, a wall was built around the well to protect it, forming a small fort complete with cannons and a guardhouse. In 1795, a high-ranking Chinese colonial official, Kapitan Cina Chua Su Cheong (Tsai Shih-chang), founded the Taoist temple of Poh San Teng dedicating it to the Peranakan deity Tua Pek Kong. Its entrance is adjacent to the fort. Following the British occupation and colonization of Malacca, the well soon fell into disuse and disrepair.
