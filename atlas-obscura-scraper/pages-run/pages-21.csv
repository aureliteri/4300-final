In its aquariums are around 6,000 species of sea creatures, and it also holds an incredible array of specimens collected during 20th century exploration. In 2011, the museum commissioned artist Mark Dion to create a new arrangement of the collection in the tradition of a cabinet of curiosity. Drawing from the archives, Dion resurrected many forgotten pieces of the vast collection founded by Prince Albert the 1st, thematically arranged in a 10-foot-high display. Between the polar bear, the antique diving suit, and the giant corals, Mark Dion’s marine wunderkammer is spectacular  in size and variety, a breathtaking display that will arouse your thirst for science.",wonder cabinets natural history animals
1,Juan Manuel Fangio Statue,"Monaco, Monaco",This statue of the great Argentinian car driver is located near a famous curve of the Monaco Grand Prix.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/juan-manuel-fangio-statue,"The Principality of Monaco paid tribute to the memory of Juan Manuel Fangio, a five-time Formula One world champion, with a life-sized bronze statue of the Argentine driver. It was at this location that he won races in 1950 and 1957. Fangio, also known as El Chueco, was considered one of the best Formula One car drivers in the world. The statue of the famed driver was dedicated by Prince Albert of Monaco. The event was attended by other car drivers like Emerson Fittipaldi and Niki Lauda. The artwork was crafted by Spanish sculptor Joaquim Ros Sabaté and is located near the entrance to the city of Monaco. There are five other sculptures by Ros Sabaté located around the world of the driver. However, this one in particular stands out because it’s located right on the Rascasse curve of the Monaco street circuit. The sculpture depicts Fangio leaning on his Mercedes Benz W196 which earned him one of his victories at the Monaco Grand Prix.",cars sports statues history & culture
2,Automatons and Dolls of Yesteryear,"Monaco, Monaco",Thousands of costumed dolls fill one of the world's creepiest museums.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-museum-of-automatons-and-dolls-of-yesteryear,"Organized by Madeleine de Galea during the 19th century, the Automatons and Dolls of Yesteryear collection at the Monaco National Museum has been called one of the creepiest in the world. Exhibits inside of the Charles Garnier-designed villa include a seemingly endless display of costumed characters in beautiful clothes displayed alongside miniature household items. Originally stored in de Galea’s personal mansion, the collection grew so fast she was forced to purchase the house next-door for extra storage space. In addition to the thousands of period dolls, the museum houses a large collection of automatons. You can see the intricate wind-up creations at any time during the museum’s regular hours, but if you sign up for a tour, the guide will likely activate many of the pieces. Some of the dolls double as automatons, breathing, sighing and playing the piano. Outside of the museum, visitors can enjoy a rose and sculpture garden.

3,Cats Museum,"Kotor, Montenegro",A curious little museum dedicated to the furry feline in the cat haven that is Old Town Kotor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cats-museum,"For cat lovers, there is no place like the medieval town of Kotor, Montenegro. The town, which was founded by the Romans in 168 BC, has a noticeably high cat population. For centuries, Kotor served as a trading port for ships from all over the world, and many of the cats who were on the ships were left behind, ultimately populating the small town with a diverse array of felines. The cats are a part of daily life in Kotor, acting as a symbol for the entire town. In fact, Kotor even has a museum dedicated to their furry residents. Tucked into an unassuming building in the heart of Old Town, the Cats Museum (Museo del Gatto di Cattaro) is a charming sight to be seen for cat lovers and loathers alike.Visitors who find their way into the tiny museum are granted access to an unusual collection of cat works from writings, coins, lithographs and much more. For those with a certain niche humor, the collection of postcards featuring cats doing human things is a must-see, while the more historically inclined will surely appreciate the pieces dating back a few centuries. In fact, an entire section of the museum is dedicated to cat artifacts dated before and during the First World War. These range from war propaganda to postcards sent from soldiers, and the care taken to preserve these strange treasures is evident. Despite its small size (just two little rooms connected by a hallway), the Cats Museum has an impressive list of registered members—all of whom have four legs. For those with only two legs, the museum does come at a cost. The admission fee, just 1 euro, does more than keep the glass cases clean; the museum also supports the local feline community through the money earned. A gift shop sells cat memorabilia alongside small bags of food to feed the many cats of Kotor who are, of course, always welcome.",cats collections museums and collections animals museums
4,Fortifications of Kotor,"Kotor, Montenegro","These historic defenses ensured the city within would survive hundreds of years of occupations, sieges, and invasions.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortifications-of-kotor,"Located on the Bay of Kotor (Boka kotorska in Montenegrin), a natural fjord near the coast of the Adriatic Sea, the city of Kotor is the oldest town in Montenegro with its roots in the ancient world. Archaeologists aren’t exactly sure, but it may have been built on top of another city as far back as 700 to 400 BCE. While the very earliest history may not be clear, the consensus is that the Greeks colonized the city starting around the 3rd century BCE. The natural steps and slopes of the hills were used as coveted protection by the ancients, but it’s also the structured walls that are striking, the majority of them are known as defensive Venetian in design and construction. The city is ancient, but the fortifications are mostly medieval. The list of attackers, occupiers, and invaders of Kotor is long, including (not in exact order) Illyrians, Romans, Byzantines, Venetians, Ottomans and Austrians. Even, at certain times, Russians, Serbians, British and Hungarians. And if invasions and attacks weren’t enough, there have been earthquakes to contend with – a major quake damaged the site as recently as 1979. Navigating the crags of the hills and walls must have proven challenging to invaders, as they tried to find their way through the jumbled warren of Kotor’s streets and walls. But they built the city this way on purpose, to keep those invaders from figuring out exactly where they were. And jutting so dramatically straight up out of the fjord, it’s easy to see why everyone wanted a piece of it. There are three gates into the Old Town to choose from",walls castles medieval ancient ruins
5,Ostrog Monastery,Montenegro,A curious cave church carved into the face of a cliff.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ostrog-monastery,"The 1600s were a turbulent time in the Balkans. The small Principality of Montenegro was fighting for survival against the mighty Ottoman Empire. Threatened by Ottoman raiders, many Orthodox Christians took to the mountains. Ostrog monastery was carved out of a vertical mountainside of of Ostroška Greda. Founded by Vasilije, the Bishop of Herzegovina and later known as St. Vasilije of Ostrog, his body is enshrined in a reliquary kept within the cool dark walls of the cave-church. Word spread quickly of the supposed miraculous healing powers of his mortal remains, and the monastery become a center of pilgrimage not only for Orthodox Christians but Catholics and Muslims as well. The tradition of pilgrimage continues to this day, with Ostrog still receiving visitors from far and wide of varying faiths, with an especially large celebration taking place on Pentecost. Much of the present look of the cave monastery complex dates from a 1923-1926 renovation after a fire. The monastery was seriously damaged in the blaze, but luckily two of the original cave chapels were spared and remain in their original condition. St. Vasilije of Ostrog is still there as well, though, over the years he has lost some of his “original condition.” From Podgorica take the road to Niksic. Some 15km after Danilovgrad you arrive in the village of Bogatic. At Bogatic you take the right turn and leave the main road. Ostrog is 8km uphill.",caves ecosystems churches sacred spaces
6,Our Lady of the Rocks,Montenegro,A tiny church on a man-made island in the Adriatic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/our-lady-of-the-rocks,"Gospa od Skrpjela (Our Lady of the Rocks) is the name of one of two tiny islands located in the inner part of Boka Kotorska bay, near the old town or Perast. The peculiar fact about these island is that they are almost completely man made. The island began as a pile of rocks, and according to legend, on 22nd of July 1452, two fishermen, brothers Moršić discovered an image of Virgin Mary there. A tiny Orthodox chapel was built on the site. In the 1600s Venetians took over the region of Boka and the city of Perast. In 1630 they built a Catholic chapel on the place of original orthodox one. They decided to further expand the island by piling rocks from the mainland and by sinking the old ships. The custom remains to this day. Every 22nd of July at sunset citizens of Perast take their boats and throw rocks into the sea. The custom is known as fašinada. The church visible today dates from 1722. It houses a venerable 15th century icon of Virgin Mary, the work of Lovro Dobričević, now know as Our Lady of the Rocks, and an altar made of Carrara marble is a work of Genovese sculptor Antonio Capelano. Behind the church there is a small museum dedicated to history of Perast. The courtyard in front is known as “Place of Reconciliation.” Today the small island church acts as a sort of cultural center of Catholics of Boka. It has served for public gatherings and as a place where local disputes were settled, most importantly blood feuds between the catholic families of Boka, preventing many vendettas.  Ferry connection available from most towns in Boka Kotorska. Quickest and cheapest from Perast. Utilizing the local public bus (€1), it took a half-hour to get from Kotor to Perast, where you are dropped off on the main square that fronts the water.  So different from the walled city of Kotor, Perast has an air of a posh waterfront town, yet the feel of a fishing village. Alternatively, there are a couple of private taxi boats, that charge €10 for the return trip as of April. 2022.",islands sacred spaces

8,Sveti Stefan,"Sveti Stefan, Montenegro",This exclusive resort has completely covered a tiny Balkan island in a 5-star warren of guest rooms.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sveti-stefan,"The Sveti Stefan resort is crammed on a tiny little offshore speck of land that once held an itty-bitty village, having converted the cram of historic buildings into exclusive lodging for its guests. The little island off of the Montenegro coast is only a little over a mile around making space on the isle a hot commodity. Originally a coastal defense was established on the land which eventually grew into a small village that was home to around 400 citizens, who built houses on every available inch of the island making it look as though they might fall right off the edge into the Adriatic. When the country came under communist rule plans were made to turn the area into a tourist spot and the villagers were relocated to the mainland by the government in order to make room for the new resort. A thin isthmus was built to connect the island to the mainland and all of the old houses were converted into singular lodgings, and the Sveti Stefan (which is the name of the resort, not the island) was born. The vacation spot had its ups and downs over the years, losing much of its luster during the 1990s in the face of government turmoil. However by the 2000s it was refurbished and once again brought up to an exclusive 5-star standard by the Aman hotel group. Today the resort is a beautiful little secret island that is off limits to anyone who is not a guest. It may have been converted into a place of leisure, but the Sveti Stefan is still a fortress of sorts, only now it simply protects elitism.  While traveling North/South through Croatia, this island sits at the end of a road cutting through Croatia, giving Bosnia access to the coast. One may not disembark a vehicle and set foot on land here as it is not Croatia but a foreign country.",places to stay hotels islands
9,Fortress Gorazda,"Škaljari, Montenegro",This World War I fortress is the perfect place to catch a Montenegrin sunset.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortress-gorazda,"This Austro-Hungarian fortress was used by the Austrians during World War I, as they traded artillery shells with Montenegrin forces. It was originally constructed around 1884-1886. Although the turret guns are long gone, the fortress and all its glory still remain. The fortress was later used as a prison during the mid-20th century. Now, it sits completely abandoned on top of a mountain overlooking both the bay of Kotor and Tivat. Although it’s now now covered in graffiti, it remains an amazing place to explore. It’s also an excellent spot to watch the sunset. The views are probably among the best in the entire region.  Getting there can be a challenge. You need a car and there are several sharp turns on the way up. There are also no street lights on the way back down after sunset.

10,Mamula Island,Montenegro,"Former military fort and site of untold horrors during WWII, this island may become the Adriatic's next luxury resort.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mamula-island,"The government of Montenegro has big plans for this haunting, uninhabited islet in the Adriatic Sea. Built in 1853, the first life of the island of Malma was that of an Austro-Hungarian military fort. The island, however, became most notorious during World War II for the isolated concentration camp built atop the footprint of the former’s ramparts. From May 30, 1942 until the end of the war, Benito Mussolini’s forces used Mamula Island to house thousands of individuals against their will. Though specific record-keeping practices wasn’t a forte of the regime, Mamula was known for being a den of cruelty and torture. At least 130 deaths were associated with the place, most of which resulted from starvation. After the closure of the concentration camp, Mamula and the rest of the buildings were left to moulder. No one has lived on the island since. Though the island is situated at an ideal distance from shore for that remote feel, paired with easy access, no efforts to redevelop the land or the buildings — including hundreds of cells once used to hold prisoners — until now. Montenegro’s officials have a plan to refurbish the crumbling fort. In this bold vision, Mamula would be scrubbed of its darkness to the point of being unrecognizable: the former concentration camp would become a modern, upscale beachside resort. Spa? Check. Infinity pool? Check. VIP nightclub? But of course. The price tag of this venture is an estimated 15 million Euro, and was pitched as an excellent way to create jobs for locals while capitalizing on the region’s booming tourism scene. As of January 2016, a Swiss investment firm has taken the bait. Orascom Development Holding AG signed a 49-year lease to make this nightmare-turned-dream into a reality. Now if only these hypothetical future tourists will remain ignorant of where they’re sleeping…",resorts hotels death world war ii islands military

12,Mausoleum of Petar II Petrovic-Njegos,"Njeguši, Montenegro",A beautiful mountaintop mausoleum devoted to a Montenegrin icon can't seem to make everyone happy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mausoleum-of-petar-ii-petrovic-njegos,"High atop an otherwise untouched mountaintop in the European country of Montenegro, the Mausoleum of Petar II Petrović-Njegoš remembers one of the region’s beloved leaders with a contest-designed tomb that still could not please many critics. Petar II Petrović Njegoš was more than just the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro. He was a philosopher and a poet, and beyond that he was a beloved political and cultural leader. Njegoš requested to be buried at a tiny chapel he had built before his death in 1851. After he passed, his body was indeed interred in the humble chapel, but it was not to rest there indefinitely. Unfortunately the small chapel was badly damaged during a war and his body was moved to its current mountaintop home. More than a hundred years later in 1974, Montenegrin authorities replaced Njegoš’ burial chapel with an impressive mausoleum designed by someone who had never been to the mountain, inciting protests among a number of citizens. Located within Lovćen National Park, the newly built mausoleum is perched atop one of Mount Lovćen’s two peaks. The dramatic building is reached after taking a long road that winds up the mountain, followed by a hike up 461 steps on foot. Inside the mausoleum is a large granite statue of Njegoš, a darkened room that contains his tomb, and a 360-degree stone viewing circle. One can see more than half of the tiny country from the summit, from the Bay of Kotor to Lake Skadar to Podgorica. On a clear day, even Albania and Croatia are visible. Despite the protests, few can claim that the Mausoleum of Petar II Petrovic-Njegos is not beautiful enough for a national hero.",tombs politics
13,Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ,"Podgorica, Montenegro","Its frescoes depict the likeness of Marshal Tito, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels burning in hell.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-of-the-resurrection-of-christ,"A universe of icons, golden backgrounds, and paintings fills the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Podgorica. Among these overflowing ornaments, as is typical of Orthodox churches, there is a fresco that aroused controversy when the church was consecrated in 2013. Near the vaults toward the top left of the altar, you’ll discover an apocalyptic scene that, at first glance, doesn’t seem extraordinary A frightening creature swims in a burning sea and swallows people in religious garments. Look closer, though, and you’ll spot that among the same eternal flames where Adam and Eve burn are three men who many have identified as Marshal Tito, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels. The three men portrayed in the fresco are the personification of a regime that persecuted the believers and the clergy. Even today, the Montenegrin population is divided between those who miss the “good old days” and those who see in communism a plague that ravaged this region for many years. For some people, watching Tito, Marx, and Engels burning in hell is an emancipation from the oppression they suffered in the past. But some say that the resemblance to the three historical figures is rather vague and unintentional. Although it is unusual for orthodox frescoes to depict contemporary themes, the three men are not the only politicians portrayed in the cathedral. The artist could have assumed no one would ever notice those controversial figures among the excess of decorations. Or he may have predicted the controversies his work would trigger, and this is the reason why he preferred to remain anonymous.  The fresco is hidden in the upper area of the basilica. Locating the three figures is not easy, but it can be an exciting treasure hunt.",communism paintings churches sacred spaces art
14,Brutalist Church of Podgorica,"Podgorica, Montenegro",This virtually windowless mass of smooth concrete is the only Catholic church in the city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brutalist-church-of-podgorica,"A short walk from the main shopping boulevard of Podgorica reveals an interesting architectural specimen, the Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus, the only Catholic temple in this otherwise largely Orthodox capital city. This surprising sight looms slightly ominously against the backdrop of rocky hills (one of which gives Podgorica its name). In a way, it honors its surrounds—the slick, concrete façade is austere and overwhelmingly stone grey. The church was built in 1969, at the height of Yugoslavia’s “golden age” of prosperity. It is a fine example of brutalist architecture, which was still very much in fashion at the time. However not many religious buildings were constructed in the style, making this Podgorica temple quite unique. The lines of the structure are straight and clean, the concrete smooth and shiny, and the windows notably absent. The church boasts an imposing 130-foot-tall bell tower and is nicely shaded by surrounding conifers. Yes, it might look a little like a bunker at first sight, but it’s an interesting and oddly calming monument that’s worth a short visit. Even though the place is situated right by a super-busy main road, there is definitely no unnecessary noise here, and it feels like a modern oasis of peace. The interior of the church is kept similarly simple and quiet. Interestingly, the exposed concrete walls do not feel as oppressive as one might imagine. Although the building has virtually no windows, there is a cleverly designed skylight above the altar, giving the main part of the church a halo of sunlight. There are also simple but futuristic lights along the walls, reminiscent of a spaceship. The central feature is an impressive backlit cross, which gives a somewhat otherworldly glow. This church is an intriguing sight, both from the inside and the outside, and not just for architecture lovers. It’s a strangely calming and completely unique place.  The church is a 15-minute walk from the Kraljev Park (King’s Park) in Nova Varoš, downtown. Follow Bulevar Svetog Petra Cetinjskog southeast. The boulevard will change its name to Pete Proleterske Brigade at some point. It will take you over one small bridge and under one railway viaduct.

15,Grahovo Memorial Park,"Grahovo, Montenegro",This memorial to local World War II heroes is slowly being reclaimed by nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grahovo-memorial-park,"An almost deserted town in rural Montenegro has a small but proud moment in World War II history. But unless you grew up there, you would probably never know it exists. Grahovo, about nine miles from the much more popular Bay of Kotor, was viciously attacked by Austro-German forces during the early stages of the war and effectively burned to the ground. However, on July 13, 1941, a group of locals, led by future national hero Savo Kovačević, successfully attacked and disarmed a group of occupying enemy soldiers. In 1977, as a monument to the indefatigable spirit of the local resistors, a seven-foot-tall bronze statue, was erected on a hill in the center of the town surrounded by 272 concrete squares, each one bearing the name of one of the locals killed during the conflict. Sadly, just two years later, a devastating earthquake shook Montenegro and devastated Grahovo, barely leaving any buildings standing. Due to the poor infrastructure and economic instability of the area, most locals picked up and moved to the larger cities, such as Niksic or the capital, Podgorica, leaving the monument, and the town itself, to slowly decay. Today, only a handful of residents remain in the town and the memorial park is rapidly losing a battle against the invading foliage of the surrounding park. With Montenegrin authorities showing little or no interest in reviving the area anytime soon, Grahovo remains a disappearing monument to resistance awaiting its next hero.  From Kotor Bay, head north on the P11 highway for about nine miles. There is a sign for the one and only road in and out of Grahovo on the left. The monument is about a five-minute drive from the turn off straight down the main street.

16,Risan Roman Mosaics,"Risan, Montenegro","The only known mosaic depicting the Greek god of sleep, Hypnos.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/risan-roman-mosaics,"Risan is an unassuming village lying on the northernmost shore of the Bay of Kotor. New structures built to welcome tourists mix freely with larger blocks built during the Yugoslavia era, but hidden behind and beneath these, there are remains of older, much older settlements. In fact, Risan is the oldest settlement on the Bay of Kotor. As far back as the 4th century B.C., an ancient manuscript called Pseudo-Scylax mentions Rhizon (modern day Risan) when describing a merchant route around the Mediterranean Sea. During the 1st and 2nd centuries, Risan eventually grew to the apogee of its affluence and importance as part of the Ancient Roman Empire. In the early 20th century, the remains of a noble’s dwelling called Villa Urbana (aka Villa Romana) were accidentally discovered by a team of workers tasked with paving a road. In the year 1930, some cursory excavations were done, but the modest exterior of the Villa Urbana and several layers of debris covering the mosaics convinced the experts that it was not worth continuing. The full extent and importance of this finding was not determined until 1957, when excavations were resumed. After three years of work, five mosaics were placed on display for everyone to see. In total, there are seven rooms in Villa Urbana and they are demarcated by what is left of the original walls, which is to say nothing more than one foot in height. Of these rooms, only five are open to the public, as the restoration work on the remaining two is yet to be completed. In addition, there is a cell with several columns that belonged to the villa, and jars encrusted with mollusk shells that were rescued from the Bay of Kotor. Tiles of three colors were deployed in most of the Risan Roman Mosaics. White tiles are made of material commonly found in the area, the black and blue-grey tiles were imported. The mosaics exhibit different patterns, according to what each room was used for. For example, in the war room, the mosaic depicts a number of double-headed axes and a rosetta, which signified power in Ancient Roman times. A similar theme can be found in the reception room, but instead of a rosetta, at the center of the room is the sun, symbolizing the Roman Empire.  Befittingly, squid and wine can clearly be recognized in the dining room, while the mosaics in the room designated for resting consist of a black and white checkerboard.  However, the masterpiece of these mosaics is in the primary bedroom, where the god of sleep, Hypnos is portrayed reclining on cushions. This is the only image of the Risan Roman Mosaics that deploys tiles of more than three colors. To date, this is the only mosaic in the world that depicts Hypnos. Adjacent to the room with the portrait of Hypnos is the entrance to an underground chamber whose purpose has puzzled archaeologists for decades.",gods mosaics mythology archaeology

The memorial sculpture on Obad’s Hill (Obadov Brijeg) commemorates the 6th Montenegrin Strike Brigade, a group of more than 500 anti-fascist fighters who defended the hill. In the late 1970s, local government and SUBNOR veterans committees in Nikšić and Danilovgrad began to organize the creation of a modest monument complex to commemorate the military victory by the 6th Montenegrin Brigade at Obad’s Hill. The memorial sculpture was designed by the Modernist architect Slobodan Vukajlović. It was completed in 1974 and inaugurated on the 30th anniversary of the defense of Obad’s Hill. Its minimalistic style is interesting in several respects in relation to its shape and form, as it bears a similarity to a swan-like bird.

Electric Ladyland is the world’s first (and seemingly only) museum focusing solely on the magic of fluorescent light. On entering the basement exhibit visitors are surrounded by bulbous, otherworldly shapes creating a fully-immersive environment straight out of a Love Generation fever dream. When the black light comes on, the home-made shapes spring to life as every surface glows with a neon phosphorescence. Patrons are encouraged to explore the psychedelic space at their own pace, taking part in what the owners call “participatory art”. While the main attraction is the experiential room, the museum also features a large collection of rocks and other elements that naturally react to UV light. The glass case full of dull gray stones explodes with flecks of electric color under the black light. The collection also contains various ephemera related to fluorescence such as vintage black light play-sets and informational displays.

De Poezenboot is an animal sanctuary floating on a canal in Amsterdam. It was founded by Henriette van Weelde in 1966 as a home for stray, sick, and abandoned felines, and has since grown into an official charity.

Many come to choose a cat for adoption, but tourists are also welcome to drop in and scratch a kitty behind the ears. As it is a charity, the boat sanctuary stays afloat thanks to donations left by visitors. All the money raised goes toward helping as many Amsterdam cats as possible. The Cat Boat Foundation pays for neutering of cats whose owners cannot afford veterinary care, as well as strays. Volunteers take care of the cats, some of whom are adopted by visitors.

22,Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam,"Amsterdam, Netherlands","Established in 1638 to battle the Black Death, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam is a treasure trove of rare flora.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hortus-botanicus-amsterdam,"It was the 1600s, and a plague had fallen upon the Netherlands. The recent influx of residents in Amsterdam had chased off the herb-tending monasteries and gobbled up land. Frantic doctors desperately needed a solution for propagating medicines as thousands of people succumbed to the ruthless Black Death. The answer—Hortus Botanicus. Established in 1638, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam ranks as one of the earliest botanical gardens still in existence, although the lofty title of “oldest” is split between the Botanical Garden of Pisa, (est. 1544) and the Botanical Garden of Padua, (est. 1545). Technically, its not even the oldest in the Netherlands, that distinction goes to the nearby Hortus Botanicus Leiden. Despite being fairly far down the list in this category, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam has other merits that your average tourist may not find impressive, but plant nerds get absolutely giddy about. Originally known as Hortus Medicus, the garden grew medicinal herbs and by 1682 the Dutch East India Company had stocked it full of rare and exotic plants never before seen in this part of the world. Their spectacular cycad collection in the Palm House is home to one of the most fascinating plants in “captivity”, offsets from Wood’s Cycad. Other famous residents include a 2,000-year old agave cactus that dates back to the Roman era, and Victoria amazonica, a lovely water lily whose 150th birthday has come and gone. Every night at dusk during bloom season, Victoria opens up the petals of her white flower, decade after decade. The garden’s coffee plants, Coffea Arabica, are considered the “parents” of 74% of the  coffee plants in the Americas. Curving paths and a hexagonal pavilion are just a few of the features that lend this unique botanical treasure its beauty—a rest from the busy streets of Amsterdam, and a place of pilgrimage for plant enthusiasts from all over the world.",cycads botanical gardens flora gardens plants
23,KattenKabinet,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Cat art as far as the eye can see.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kattenkabinet,"The death of a pet can inspire a number of reactions, but rarely has anyone taken their grief and started a museum, as was the case with The Netherlands’ KattenKabinet. The KattenKabinet, or “Cat Cabinet,” was founded by Bob Meijer in 1990 as an act of remembrance for his own departed cat, John Pierpont Morgan. Throughout J.P. Morgan’s nine lives, the feline received birthday gifts from Meijer’s friends such as paintings, a bronze cat statue, and even a recreated American dollar bill with Morgan in place of Washington, and the coda, “We Trust No Dog.” With these pieces already in hand, Meijer began the museum in the bottom floors of his historic 1667 townhouse. While Meijer and his family still live in the upper floors of the old patrician merchant’s house, the public museum rooms display cats of all species and hue, depicted in a variety of mediums from paintings and sculptures to posters and books. While a cheeky collection such as this could be presented as gaudy or tacky, the KattenKabinet is decorated and the artworks displayed in the baroque style of a stuffy classical museum. The classy cat collection has even partnered with such austere establishments as the Museum Van Gogh, Amsterdam to present works of both artistic and feline importance. And like any true collection of art, the KattenKabinet released a catalogue of their works called the “Cat-a-Logue.” Of course the KattenKabinet would be nothing without some live specimens to wander the stoic halls and fill the space with a unique feline aroma. To that end Meijer owns no less than five cats that roam the museum and greet visitors. This museum is more fascinating than a ball of string covered in catnip.",cats paintings memorials collections sculptures animals museums

Both were professors of anatomy at the Athenaeum Illustre, the predecessor of the University of Amsterdam. Willem wrote extensively on deformities, including cyclopia, the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies, and conjoined twins. His personal collection of specimens built onto that of his father, resulting in several thousand items left behind at his death. The collection was purchased by the city of Amsterdam in 1869 and eventually found its home at the university. Other anatomical collections have been added to the museum over the years, including a collection of bone pathology, a dental collection, and other teratological specimens. There are also a number of animal specimens in the collection. The oldest specimens are from the 16th century; the newest specimens were added to the collection around 1950. Since 2011, over 2,000 historical specimens have been on display in Museum Vrolik. The complete collection, of which about 10% is exhibited, consists of 20,000 objects.  Open Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The entrance fee is €10 for adults and €5 for children. Guided tour for a group of up to 15 visitors is possible and costs €35 plus €10 per person. Tours (in Dutch or English) can be requested on Museum Vrolik's website, at least two weeks in advance. How to get there: Museum Vrolik is located in the Academic Medical Centre in J0 (J-zero).

Opened in 2014 with a personal visit by the Queen Máxima of the Netherlands— showing that she is not afraid to get her hands dirty—the zoo of tiny things sets out to show how interesting and beautiful the invisible world all around us can be. Sitting in the heart of Amsterdam, the facility features exhibits such as petri dishes filled with artfully grown cultures that show the naturally occurring designs they create, and a “scanner” that shows exactly what is growing on people, and where. The only light in the exhibition comes from the displays themselves. The result is a space that feels clean, but almost dank. There is also a microbiology lab on site that grows and cares for the microbes on display. The lab technicians act as both zookeepers and docents, ready to answer any questions that aren’t answered by the big screen microscopes that show what the little things look like up close. When kids come home from the zoo, they are usually prone to shrieking ad nauseam about their favorite animal. It’s about time they came home screaming the names of bacteria.",zoos animals

If you enter Oudemanhuispoort through the Oudezijds Achterburgwal side, you will get one allusion to this passage’s past. Overhead, chiseled into a pediment, is a set of spectacles referring to old age. Indeed, “Old Man’s House Passage” once acted as part of the Netherlands’ first senior citizen home back in the 18th century. Now part of the University of Amsterdam, it actually has a 400-year-old history that has seen it be home to a convent, a hospital for cholera victims, an arts academy, and a museum that formed the basis for the Rijksmuseum and its famous collection of Rembrandts and Vermeers. Since 1886, the stalls of this covered walkway have been selling second hand prints, sheet music, and books. The stalls are currently run by an older generation of fellows—many with spectacles—who are only too willing to share their knowledge. Perhaps some even have secondhand stories about Vincent van Gogh browsing here for inspiration. For example, it’s been said that it was here that everyone’s favorite earless genius found the Japanese prints that he found so inspiring, changing the course of Western art.

28,In't Aepjen,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",This historic Amsterdam bar used to accept sailor's monkeys as payment.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/in-t-aepjen,"After Amsterdam was destroyed by fire in 1452, the old city was rebuilt using brick. Of all the old wooden buildings that had made up the historic city, only two survived. One of these premises was an inn, located on the corner of the old Zeedijk (sea dike), near the infamous red light district. Called “In’t Aepjen,” it has provided ales, jenever, food, and lodgings since 1519, and is one of Amsterdam’s oldest bars. “In’t Aepjen” literally means “In the Monkeys,” and refers to a time in the golden age of the Dutch Empire, when sailors returning from such distant colonies as Indonesia, and finding themselves short of guilders, would offer up their newly acquired pets as payment, often literally paying their bills in monkeys. Soon the In’t Aepjen was overrun with so many monkeys that customers began to complain of the fleas. The monkeys were given to a regular customer at the tavern, Gerard Westerman, who kept them in his large garden in the east of the city. Westerman’s animal garden would eventually become Amsterdam’s Artis Zoo, one of Europe’s oldest. Today the venerable old tavern is decorated with monkeys everywhere you look; carved statues, vintage posters, and oil portraits hanging from the bar. You may no longer be able to pay your bar tab with one, but one of the oldest buildings in Amsterdam is still very much “In the Monkeys.”",monkeys bars shops animals

31,Our Lord in the Attic,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",The attic of a four-century-old canal house hides a clandestine church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/our-lord-in-the-attic,"The canal house at Number 40, Oudezijds Voorburgwal, Amsterdam, looks much like the other Queen Anne-style homes that the old city is famous for. Built as a residential home in 1630, in the heart of the oldest part of Amsterdam and bordering the infamous red light district, this particular steep-gabled building holds a remarkable secret. Making your way through the nearly 400-year-old corridors, kitchens, and bedrooms, there is a narrow and steep staircase that leads to the upper floors. Where, hidden away in the attic, is a magnificently miniature, fully-appointed Catholic church. The clandestine church, known in Dutch as a “schuilkerk,” was secreted away in the attic on purpose due to the persecution of Catholicism in Holland in the 17th century. Unable to hold mass in public, Jan Hartmann converted the attic of his home to a church in 1663. Entrance to the church, known as Our Dear Lord in the Attic or “Ons’ Lieve Heer op Solder,” was gained through a fake door hidden in the living room. This led onto a tiny spiral staircase that would take the faithful Papists into the top reaches of the attic. Whilst nothing on the outside of the home suggests what is hidden inside, the miniature church is an exquisitely appointed place of worship. With seating for about 150 worshippers in narrow gallery seating, the secret church is beautifully decorated in the Dutch classicist style. The marble and gilt altar is lavishly decorated with a painting of the Baptism of Christ by Jacob de Wit, surrounded by pillars made from more marble. The secret church was turned into a museum in 1888, making it the second oldest museum in the city. But this unique treasure is still in use today, with regular services held in the attic, just as they have been for the past 400 years.",secret hidden churches sacred spaces

Images associated with the Dutch city’s iconic waterways fill the approximately 4,840-square-foot glass mosaic, and there are also Art deco mirrors and chandeliers made from recycled bicycle parts. The floors, which were made with traditional Italian Terrazzo, were designed with patterns that mimic those typically found at archaeological excavations.

33,Café Papeneiland,"Amsterdam, Netherlands","Famed for its pie, this eatery has a hidden tunnel that allowed Catholics to secretly walk to church during the Reformation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cafe-papeneiland,"On its surface, Cafe Papeneiland is the perfect example of  the gezelligheid, or “coziness,” for which Dutch “brown cafes” are renowned. With its brown walls, chandeliers emitting soft light, and display of beautiful Delft plates and tiles, the eatery offers a warm, welcoming place for a hot drink or stellar slice of apple pie. But beneath its comfy exterior lurks a hidden history of religious resistance. During the Dutch Protestant Reformation of the 16th and 17th centuries, the government outlawed Catholicism. As a result, Catholics had to worship in secret. This led to the establishment of hidden churches, some of which still exist today. Our Lord in the Attic, for example, is a beautiful, 150-seat chapel, complete with pillars, a giant painting of Christ’s baptism, and a marble-and-gilt altar, all tucked away in (you guessed it) an attic. In Amsterdam’s Jordaan neighborhood, worshippers once secretly entered a church through a tunnel that ran beneath the canal. That tunnel opened at the building that houses Cafe Papeneiland, and it can still be seen today. The cafe’s very name is a nod to this history: Papeneiland means “papists’ island,” referencing how the building was a sanctuary for Roman Catholics, who were also known as “papists” due to their allegiance to the Pope. Today, the cafe is most well-known for its apple pie (or “tart,” depending on where you’re from). The fame is  deserved: The pie has a flaky crust, the perfect balance of tart-sweet apples and cinnamon spice, and a light-yet-rich tuft of whipped cream on the side. Order a slice, then ask your server to point you in the direction of the tunnel’s entrance. It’s behind a green-barred gate along the stairs to the basement. Sometimes obscured by brooms and other cleaning supplies, this doorway to the past can be easy to miss.

Looking like nothing more than Venice as designed by hobbits, this idyllic locale was actually founded by outlaws and mercenaries. Around 1230 CE a group of fugitives from the Mediterranean region founded the small hamlet, but it wasn’t until later that a group of monks dug the iconic canals in order to transport peat through the area. Due to this, the canals are only about a meter deep. The town survived down the centuries and is now home to just under 3,000 people. Most of the homes in Giethoorn sit on small private islands that are only connected by the more than 100 wooden bridges that criss-cross the landscape. All told, there are over four miles of canals separating the various islets. Travel among the islands is only possible via small boats, including gondolas, rowboats, and ships called “whisper boats” which have tiny, silent engines to keep from breaking the quaint atmosphere. Giethoorn may not be Venice, but it makes Italy’s river city look like a crass metropolis. Yearly 1 million people visit this small village.

This picturesque region happens to be home to the oldest Jewish cemetery in the Netherlands, Beth Haim. Beth Haim means “House of Life,” and as you will see, it is indeed full of life. The cemetery is like a lush and peaceful secret garden. Most of the tombstones are hidden in the midst of tall grass and wild bushes. The grave markers depict detailed scenes from the past that tell the stories of the people who are buried here, of their lives, their values, and their beliefs. There are about 28,000 graves at Beth Haim, many of which belong to the Sephardi Jews, whose ancestors came from Spain and Portugal. The cemetery was purchased by the Jewish community of Amsterdam in 1614 and almost reached full capacity in 1923. Many famous Jewish rabbis, diplomats, and scientists are buried here, such as the parents of the Dutch philosopher Spinoza. The tombstones have inscriptions in Dutch, Portuguese, and Hebrew, and are carved with elaborate scenes containing many beautiful mystic symbols. The Rodeamentos House is where the funeral ceremonies take place. It was built in 1705 and divides the old part of the cemetery with historical monumental tombstones from the section containing relatively new graves.

The Netherlands boasts many varieties named for the regions where they’re produced. But when it comes to the country’s most famous cheese, Gouda, there is no geographical limitation to where it can be made. This might raise the question of what makes a Gouda a Gouda. The Amsterdam cheese museum is here answer that, as well as other FAQs about Dutch dairy. The top floor of the museum is a specialty cheese shop with most well-known Dutch brands and many smaller, more specialized varieties, including Twentse bunker cheese, truffle cheese, and even cheese with saffron. Most of the cheese is available on sample platters, and the staff will happily tell you about its origin. In the basement, there is a small museum that shows the process of making Gouda cheese, from the cow all the way to the market. You’ll also find examples of old instruments such as cheese-curd cutters, a milk machine, and even a specialized cheese scale.

If you look up between the branches of a large tree across the Leidsekade from the American Hotel, you may spot a very industrious, very small man. A bronze statue wearing work gear leans over intently, using both of his tiny hands to saw away at the branch below him. The 50-centimeter-tall woodcutter appeared on his branch on January 30th, 1989. The timing, the day before former Queen Beatrix’s birthday, has led some locals to conclude that the piece was either commissioned or created by Beatrix herself, a known lover of the arts. The same mysterious sculptor has placed other works around the city - among them a musician in the Town Hall and several small men climbing the wall in the Anjelierstraat. This piece, hidden in the foliage, is probably the most difficult to spot, and thus the most sought-after. Since the statue’s installation several decades ago, the tree has grown up and around him, swallowing his shoes and part of his saw blade. Whether or not his maker eventually chooses to reveal their identity, all signs point to that the industrious woodcutter will remain hard at work. This little fellow also has been made subject of modern treasure hunters, since it is a main feature in a Geocache. Update as of November 2019: The woodcutter is no longer on his normal perch due to a strong wind, it’s unknown when the figure will be replaced. Update as of January 2022: The woodcutter is now placed in another tree at the same park right above the path towards the north.",mystery hidden trees sculptures plants

Founded in 1985, it has grown into a popular and idyllic meeting spot for visitors and locals alike. At a time when craft breweries were hard to come by in the Netherlands, founder Kasper Peterson was inspired by his experience with Belgian beer styles and, as his brewery has grown, so has its offerings and experimental nature. The ostrich-and-egg logo was also Peterson’s brainchild, as he had a particular fondness for the oversized avian species (which is fitting in respect to the brewery’s proximity to Amsterdam’s Royal Artis Zoo). The brewery’s offerings include Belgian styles such as dubbels and tripels as well as a pilsner and IPAs. As if enjoying a beer beside a windmill wasn’t enough to entice customers, the Brouwerij’t IJ also serves up puns on the sly. For most unsuspecting and uninitiated tourists, it’s easy for the wordplay to go right over your head since it delightfully deals with the letters i and j. In Dutch, IJ is the name of the river that the brewery sits on. Pronounced “eye,” this could also be used for the Dutch word for “egg,” which is actually spelled ei. Some beers on tap include the IJ Wit (or “Egg White”), the Paas IJ (“Easter Egg”), the IJndejaars (“One Year Old”), and the IJbok (“Egg Buck,” whatever that is), in addition to more standard and less playfully named brews. Continuing with its theme of avian appreciation, the brewery adopted one of the ostriches at the Artis zoo and named her Esasa, Zulu for “be happy.”  There is another bar situated just before you get to the Brouwerij't IJ, profiting from the brewery's popularity and unsuspecting tourists. Don't be fooled: Keep walking through until you get to the brewery.",windmills bath house breweries beer
43,Oudekerksplein,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",This city square is home to Amsterdam's oldest church and a statue honoring Dutch sex workers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oudekerksplein,"Amsterdam is one of the oldest and most beautiful cities in Europe. It is also a self-proclaimed experiment in freedom, which has led to many of the city’s historic buildings and districts housing sex shops and coffeeshops selling marijuana. Oude Kerk (Old Church) is the oldest church in Amsterdam, constructed in 1306. Its towering arches and floor constructed of gravestones makes it a unique and sacred site in the city. But as is so common in Amsterdam, the church has become a place where the sacred and the profane meet. Situated on Old Church Square, the church now shares real estate with the a heavily trafficked zone of De Wallen, or the Red Light District. Although some raised eyebrows at the collision of the two worlds, the city seems to have embraced the dichotomy. Proudly standing in front of the church doors, a bronze statue entitled “Belle” was erected in 2007 as a monument to the sex workers of the world. Old Church Square also boasts a metal relief in the cobblestones of a hand caressing a woman’s breast, another reference to Amsterdam’s lively participation in the world’s oldest profession.",sex churches monuments sacred spaces statues
44,Labyrint Drielandenpunt,"Vaals, Netherlands",A beautiful maze marks where three countries meet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/labyrint-drielandenpunt,"The Drielanden Labyrinth (or Three Country Labyrinth) is Europe’s largest outdoor shrub maze. It was built by British landscape artist Adrian Fisher who used 17,000 hornbeam shrubs to constitute the maze. Not only is the maze the most southeasterly place in the Netherlands, but it is also the highest. The most exciting aspect of the Drielandaen Labyrinth, however, is, as its namesake suggests, that it is located where the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany all meet. In the middle of the maze, which is said to take up to an hour to complete, is a platform allowing visitors to look off into any of the three countries as well as at their fellow maze travelers as they struggle in the network of hornbeams below. In addition to the unique entrance building with a roof in the shape of a gigantic butterfly, a water playground has been created with dozens of fountains. Surrounding the labyrinth are a handful of other recreational activities for visitors to enjoy. There is a playground for the younger crowd and clay shooting and archery for the older crowd. Fittingly enough, there are also smuggling games for visitors to play, where they reenact the once frequent passage of smugglers looking to save their money by jumping borders. And finally, the Border Stone Tavern is located conveniently across the boardwalk from an inn, for those travelers who are looking to spend the night.",hedge mazes mazes borders plants
45,Red Light Secrets,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",This museum housed in a former brothel explores the past and present of sex work in Amsterdam.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/red-light-secrets,"Amsterdam is filled with beautiful architecture, long twisting canals, and a rich history. While many tourists come for these draws, some are more interested in the Red Light District and the legal marijuana. The Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution tackles the former, and informs visitors about the lives of sex workers and the history of the district. Known to locals as De Wallen, the Red Light District is Amsterdam’s oldest district, built around 1385. The district has gained notoriety for its many brothels, and has been controversial as the legality of sex work has ebbed and flowed over time. As of 2000, brothels are legal in the Netherlands and require a permit to do business. Red Light Secrets is located in a building that was once a brothel. Most of the interior structure has been kept as it was, with some extra rooms added to show various types of accommodations. In the two-story building, there are rooms that explore different types of sex work and an audio tour from a Russian woman named Inga, who worked in Amsterdam’s sex industry for 15 years, however, she saw herself more as a sex therapist. The museum’s mission is to educate people about sex work in Amsterdam, including the measures that have been taken to prevent human trafficking. It is filled with stories from sex workers about their lives and how they got into the industry. Their goal is to help demystify sex work, and show that sex workers are people who should be treated with dignity and respect.  You need to be 16+ to enter this museum. While most of the images are PG and you won't see anything beyond the occasional pair of breasts, the audio tour does include some relatively graphic descriptions. A ticket to the museum is €14.50 for adults and €12.50 for students. Open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight, and the last admission is 30 minutes before closing time.",prostitution brothels sex museums

Mosey up to the tall window of Pizzeria San Marco, and drop anchor for a uniquely enjoyable slice of pizza, prepared as you relax amidships with a beer. San Marco is housed within a brown-hued former watchtower on the canal bridge. But its main draw is the pizza window, located on the water, where boats can haul up and place orders. It isn’t unusual on a sunny afternoon to see a hungry boatman guardedly balancing on the bow to clamber up to the window and holler for a Margherita. San Marco’s menu mirrors that of the average neighborhood pizza place. There’s an assortment of pizzas, pastas, salads and antipasti, and a sparse beverage list with sodas, beer, and one option each for white and red wine. Enjoy a slice in view of the flowerbeds adorning the nearby bridge, as cyclists jingle along, and tourists and pedestrians linger on to marvel at the magnificent Amstel River. Take in the mellow ripple of an oar splashing into the water, as the symphony of a vibrant city plays above. It all adds up to a rather memorable way to enjoy a pizza pie.

Only this time, the pink triangle serves as a memorial to the homosexuals that have been persecuted through the years. The monument was designed in 1980, commissioned after gay activists were arrested in 1970 for placing a lavender wreath on Amsterdam’s National War Memorial in Dam Square. It consists of three triangles connected by lines to form one larger triangle. The memorial was built by the canal with the triangles strategically positioned: one points to the memorial in Dam Square, another to the headquarters of COC Nederland, the oldest continuously operating gay rights organization in the world, dating back to 1946. The third triangle points to Anne Frank’s house, and includes an inscription from a poem by a gay Jewish poet: “Naar Vriendschap Zulk een Mateloos Verlangen” (“Such an endless desire for friendship”). The Homomonument was finally unveiled in 1987, and has since inspired similar monuments in other cities, including some based on the Homomonument’s design.

It’s housed in a 19th-century former foreman’s home in De Nieuwe Ooster, Amsterdam’s largest cemetery. The museum explores the multicultural nature of funeral practices in the country, as well as the funeral traditions of various religions. Rather than the usual death museum fare of true crime or medical specimens, Tot Zover focuses on the culture and conversation around death and the funeral industry. Its collections include books of post-mortem photography, early-20th-century hearses, Victorian hair keepsakes, and handmade urns for pets. Past exhibitions have examined Italian coffin marketing—calendars with scantily clad women posing both on and in the merchandise—and the use of smartphones as records of the device’s owner’s death in the Middle East. The museum also hosts regular Dutch-language “mourning cafes” for locals, with guest speakers giving lectures and guiding discussions.  The museum is easily accessed by metro from the city center to Amstelstation. Most exhibition texts are in both English and Dutch.",funeral death cemeteries collections museums and collections museums

They just aren’t usually stacked 11 stories high to make one gigantic hotel that many have deemed an architectural monstrosity. Inspired by the small cottages of the region and Claude Monet’s painting of the blue house of Zaandam, architect Wilfried van Winden set about creating a hotel that was both futuristic and retro simultaneously. Complete with 160 rooms, Turkish baths, a bar, and a swimming pool, Winden’s masterpiece has all the regular amenities of a hotel. Yet its design manages to allude to the idea that there is no place like home. Altogether, the exterior features nearly 70 cottage facades, each with a varied shade of green and different window layout. Topped off with a red-orange roof, the stacked-cottage Inntel Hotel is one of the first parts of a revitalization campaign in the city, aimed at restoring its buildings without losing the charm of the town’s trademark architecture.",places to stay hotels shops
50,Bloemen Route,"Haarlem, Netherlands","The Bloemen Route, or “Flower Route”, stretches 25 miles through prime Dutch tulip country as a result of “tulip mania,” the world’s first economic bubble.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bloemen-route,"Floral cultivation, also known as floriculture, began in the Netherlands in 1593, when the first tulip was planted on Dutch soil. Since then, the flower business has boomed, albeit in bizarre fashion. In the 1600s, merchants from Amsterdam began to travel to the East Indies, and when they returned with remarkable profit, they built large estates surrounded by tulips. Suddenly, tulips became a status symbol in the Netherlands, and everyone wanted one. As demand for tulips grew, a phenomenon referred to as “tulip mania,” the vendors of the flowers steadily raised their prices, and in 1634, speculators were introduced into the tulip market. A futures market was created, where vendors sold contracts which allowed buyers to purchase bulbs in the future, at the very end of the growing season. By the winter of 1636-37, many of the bulb futures were changing hands a whopping ten times a day, and one singular bulb cost a ridiculous sum, equivalent to ten times the annual salary of a skilled craftsman. This market for tulips is often referred to as the world’s first economic bubble. Then, as the Bubonic Plague spread throughout the Netherlands, consumers stopped showing up to tulip markets, and the bubble burst. It sent the country into complete economic collapse, which had reverberations all across Europe. Despite the economic collapse of the tulip market, tulip mania left its mark. Without tulip mania, the Netherlands wouldn’t have the floral patchwork it has today. The biggest Dutch flower auctions bring in five billion dollars each year. The country is filled with flowers, so many that the road going through the largest cluster is 25 miles long. This route is called the Bloemen Route, and it winds through a rainbow of colors, all Dutch tulips, fields of different pigments arranged next to each other like a floral quilt. So beautiful are some of these tulips that you might just want to spend ten times your annual salary to buy one. The Bloemen Route starts in Haarlem and ends in Leiden. The famous town of Lisse, home to the world-renowned Keukenhof Gardens, is located at the heart of it. Instead of driving the route, you can rent a bike to enjoy the floral beauty to the fullest. There’s a yearly Flower Parade, featuring dozens of tulip-decorated floats, that largely follows this same route. It’s called the Bloemencorso Bollenstreek and takes place around mid-April.  Peak-blooming season for the tulips is the second half of April.",horticulture flowers roads roadside attractions plants history

The king of elevators in those days was the paternoster lift, an ever-moving chain of elevator cabins that didn’t stop or slow down. Invented in the 1860s by Peter Ellis, paternoster lifts were revolutionary for their time, as they drastically reduced the travel time between offices and departments scattered across various levels. The lifts were mainly popular in Europe, though today, very few still exist. The lift in Amsterdam’s Grand Hotel Amrâth was installed in the 1910s when the building was built. The building was symbolically built on the spot where Cornelis de Houtman first sailed to the East Indies, which is fitting given the structure’s intended purpose. The building was originally constructed as an international office for a group of shipping companies, including the famous VOC. It was meant as a place to buy tickets for crossings, order or sell cargo, and for sailors to collect their wages. Therefore, it was prudent to have a fast way to traverse the floors. Today, the lift is still in motion, but all doors are sealed off with glass. There are two elevators back to back in the building.  The lift is still in motion, but all doors are sealed off with glass. It is not possible to enter it but you can look at it. Access to the hotel is free, and the reception will usually let you in to take a look if there is not a big banquet or something happening. There are also weekly tours provided by the hotel that go past the elevator.",elevators technology hotels architectural oddities architecture
52,REM Eiland,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",This pirate-broadcasting-tower-turned-restaurant played a rebellious role in the history of Dutch television.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rem-eiland-radio-television-tower-restaurant,"The restaurant known as REM Eiland wasn’t always an architectural oddity in the Amsterdam port of Houthaven. The 80-foot-tall, red-and-white tower was originally a pirate radio and TV station in the North Sea, and it gave Dutch viewers their first taste of commercial television. It was 1964, and up to that point, there’d only been state-sponsored television. From the tower, a channel called TV Noordzee broadcast shows such as Zorro, Rin-Tin-Tin, and Mr. Ed, along with commercials. While viewers were entertained, the government was not: The tower’s location in international waters allowed TV Noordzee to circumvent Dutch laws. But this rebellion was short-lived: Four months after TV Noordzee launched, the government found a way to use the 1958 Geneva Convention to justify restructuring offshore territorial boundaries. And with that, REM Eiland fell under Dutch control. On December 17, 1964, marines raided the tower and shut down operations. The government used the tower as a site for measuring ocean temperatures and salt levels before dismantling it and bringing it ashore in 2006. But just when REM Eiland seemed like it might disappear for good, new owners purchased it and started renovations (including adding another floor and losing the helipad) to turn it into the restaurant it is today. Now, diners can ascend the tower’s zigzagging stairs to reach the bar and dining area. The menu features tournedos (tiny, round cuts of beef), sea bass, and sandwiches with fillings ranging from steamed mackerel to eggs with aged gouda. REM Eiland’s most spectacular offering, however, is the view of the IJ river and surrounding city. Order a beer from nearby Brouwerij ‘t IJ or a cocktail at the bar, and raise a glass to the era of offshore pirate broadcasting.  The tower is also home to an office, so just follow the signs to make sure you’re heading to the restaurant.",radio rivers restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars architectural oddities architecture

As it’s a prime location for real estate development, it seems like a miracle that the graveyard still exists. The land has a long human history. Huis te Vraag, which means House for Inquiry in Dutch, allegedly got its name because in 1489, Austrian emperor Maximilian I asked for directions to Amsterdam at the inn that was once located there. The inn and the mansion later built atop the land disappeared, but the name stuck. In 1891, the place reopened as a private gravesite for the Dutch Reformed Church, thanks to the efforts of a local carpenter who had bought the land. At least 16,000 bodies were then buried there. Some of the anonymously interred were those whose bodies were found in the area during and after World War II. Nowadays, the cemetery is maintained to preserve a precarious balance between the gray of the graves and the green of the foliage. It’s a peaceful, quiet place. Though it’s closed to the dead—the last burial took place in the 1960s—the cemetery is still open to the living.  Huis te Vraag is open for visitors during slightly erratic opening hours. As of October 2018, the cemetery can be visited Tuesday to Thursday from 11:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m., but this is subject to change.",graveyards graves gravestones burial places cemeteries
54,Kleine Trippenhuis,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",One of Amsterdam's narrowest houses is located right across the canal from its widest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kleine-trippenhuis-little-trip-house,"With real estate in high demand, capital cities are often crowded with tightly packed homes, and Amsterdam takes this to the extreme with its long blocks of tall and narrow houses. The reasons behind the different shapes of the rowhouses vary, but the Kleine Trippenhuis, or “Little Trip House,” is especially unique. The Trippenhuis, or “Trip House,” is Amsterdam’s widest home, spanning an enormous 72 feet (22 meters). It was built in 1666 as the double-house residence of the two Trip brothers and their families, who had made a fortune in the arms trade. (Evidence of their profession can be seen in various features of the mansion, such as the canons engraved on the facade and the mortar-shaped chimneys.) Across the street is the little, white Kleine Trippenhuis, which measures a mere 8 feet wide (2.44 meters) in stark contrast to its larger namesake. As the story goes, the diminutive dwelling was built by the brothers Trip for their carriage driver, who was overheard saying that he would be the happiest man in the world if he could only have a house as wide as his master’s front door. In reality, this is likely just a myth. The skinny house was built some 60 years after the Trip mansion, after both of the brothers were dead, most likely in order to squeeze a domicile into what was previously a tiny alleyway. Were it true, the carriage driver’s wish would have been realized, as the Trippenhuis door is just a wee bit thinner than the little house.  The bottom of the house is a shop so you can go in and see how small it is. The top floors are inhabited and not open for exploring. The Trippenhuis mansion across the way now houses the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

56,Biblioteca Ets Haim,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",The world's oldest Jewish library was founded by Sephardic Jews in 17th century Amsterdam.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/biblioteca-ets-haim,"In the late 1500s and early 1600s, as Sephardic Jews were establishing a community in Amsterdam, they founded a school for themselves that would become the oldest continuously operating Jewish library in the world. Having been forced to live as Christians in their home countries, Spain and Portugal, Sephardic Jews arrived in Amsterdam with the promise of religious freedom. The school/library, Ets Haim (Hebrew for “Tree of Life”), was founded in 1616 to help the newcomers start living publicly as Jews again. Many had continued to practice their true religion in secret while living outwardly as Christians. Amassing the library allowed them to debate among themselves, after so long, what being Jewish meant. In 1675, the library moved to the Esnoga, the Portuguese Synagogue complex. Since it was dangerous to have open flames in a library, skylights and octagonal openings between the two floors were incorporated into the design to let in natural light for reading. Today, electric lights, including chandeliers, light the rooms, and the bookshelves are floor to ceiling. A wooden spiral staircase connects the floors. The library holds, in total, nearly 30,000 printed works dating back to 1484 and more than 500 manuscripts dating back to 1282. The documents not only represent centuries of Jewish thought and scholarship, but also the community’s everyday life. They paint a picture of Sephardic Culture going back to its roots in the Iberian Peninsula. In 1889, David Montezinos, the librarian at the time, donated his substantial private library (20,000 books, pamphlets, manuscripts, and illustrations) to Ets Haim after his wife died. It has since been known as Ets Haim/Livraria Montezinos. Over the past few years, in collaboration with the National Library of Israel and the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, Ets Haim has been digitizing its manuscripts so they can be easily accessed by people around the world. It is also expected that, with the imaging technology available for the process, scholars will be able to examine the digitized documents more thoroughly than they would in person with the naked eye. Ets Haim is one of the Dutch Department of Culture’s National Cultural Heritage sites, and part of UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register. The library is inside the synagogue complex.

There are urinals scattered throughout the city’s streets. Some look like strange silver structures; others resemble large green garbage bins. But only one esteemed urinal has been granted national monument status. This toilet overlooks the canal outside the building that once housed the new wing of City Hall. Though the urinal was built in 1926, it wasn’t deemed a national monument until the 21st century. It’s a rather pretty structure, befitting of the City Hall users it was built for. Its brick and stone base make it blend in with the nearby architecture. A stone statue rests atop its roof, overlooking its entrance. When viewed from the outside, there’s little indication that the interior air is saturated with the scent of pee. The urinal is one of the 35 comfort stations available to male pedestrians with full bladders. In contrast, there are only three public bathrooms available for women.

58,Pianola Museum,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",A unique collection of gilded age mechanical pianos.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pianola-museum,"In a city chock-a-block with museums, one of the smallest and most delightfully eccentric is home to about 50 mechanical player pianos and almost 20,000 punched rolls of music. Volunteers are on-hand to give you a personalised tour. The player piano was a very popular American invention of the late 1800s. The latest evolution of musical automata, these self-playing pianos began to emerge along with mechanical adaptations for standard pianos in the 1870s. Most of them required a human user to use the foot pedal bellows to run machinery that pulled scrolls of pre-programmed music past the mechanical parts, which then activated the keys of the piano. The name Pianola was a trademark of the The Aeolian Corporation of New York in the 1890s, but the name was broadly applied to all player pianos. Export to Europe began in 1899 where these expensive machines quickly gained popularity in the posher homes and music halls. The program scrolls were made of normal paper, punched with holes or slits to correspond to notes, much like early computer punch cards. Some composers took advantage of the new technology to design songs that could not be played with a mere ten fingers, creating unique pieces exclusive to the machine’s inexhaustible supply of virtual fingers. Sadly, most of these compositions are rather unlistenable. The wonderfully scenic Jordaan neighbourhood where this museum is located has long been gentrified (though you can still witness its roots during the Monday Morning Flea Market on Noordermarkt). But in the heyday of the pianola, it was still distinctly working class and could not afford such fancy technology. However, the district did have a roll-making factory. When this business went bankrupt, the factory was taken over by a certain Otto Frank who moved in with his family to set up a business—the building is indeed now known as the Anne Frank House. (As an odd parallel, an IBM punch card system similar to that of the pianola was used by the Nazis to help facilitate the streamlining of mass genocide.) By the end of WWII, the pianola market had dried out: radio and vinyl record players had completely taken over. And while vinyl records are currently enjoying a renaissance, it’s not likely the same will happen for the pianola. As of 2018, the museum has also faced the danger of an impending sale of its building. So support this wonderful hands-on museum while you still can! By tram: 3, 10 (stop Marnixbad).

59,Celestial Vault,"The Hague, Netherlands",Hidden within a Netherlands crater is a stone bed that lets those who lie in it see the sky as a curved surface.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/celestial-vault,"The astronomical optical illusion/art installation in the Hague known as the Celestial Vault is a curious location that is equal parts Druidic stone altar and stark modern landscaping which allows those willing to interact with it a chance to see the heavens in a new way. Built in 1996 by artist James Turrell, the Celestial Vault is a monumental earthwork built up to resemble a large crater. After entering the crater via a curved tunnel that runs through one side, visitors will find nothing but a lush, grassy interior and an odd stone bench in the very center. The stone is flat on top and slightly peaked so that there are two identical sloping planes. The idea is for visitors to lie on the slabs with their heads towards the lower ends of the slopes which will allow them to see the edge of the crater but mainly the open sky. With the curved edge as a reference point the sky appears to be a curved dome (which it sort of is). This optical illusion was inspired by the findings of a Belgian astronomer who noted how light affects our perception, and now anyone in the area can find out how true that is for themselves. Today the work is not as sharply manicured as it was in the late 90s with overgrown foliage and other blemishes marking the crater slopes, yet the immovable bench remains in perfect working order, just waiting for people to expand their minds.

The museum began as the “Cabinet of Curiosities” of Pieter Teyler van der Hulst, and remains housed in his former home. Opened to the public in 1784, it is still lit only by daylight. Items are displayed in beautiful glass cases and bell jars. Teyler was an influential merchant and academic in Haarlem, Netherlands. His society had separate groups for the study of religion, science and art, each of which had five “caretakers” in charge of that department. The museum continued to attract influential caretakers through the early 1900s and Hendrik Lorenz, a famous theoretical physicist, was the director of research from 1910 til 1928. From fossils to coins, the museum boasts a broad collection of “naturalia and artificialia, fossils and telescopes, optical toys and comparative telegraph cables, automata and minerals, models and bird eggs, paintings and scientific glassware-all housed beneath lofty sculpted and glass-vaulted ceilings.” Started as a Cabinet of Curiosities, the museum today continues to delight and bring out the curiosity in its modern day visitors. The Teylers Museum also collaborates with the Guislain Museum in Gent, Belgium, on rotating exhibitions. Currently, the Teylers Museum hosts a exhibit exploring the tension between faith and science, and the influence of Darwin.

Occupying 15th-century hunting grounds with the eponymous 17th-century country house-turned-castle, the old Keukenhof gardens had long provided cooking herbs for the manor, hence the name referencing “kitchen” (“keuken” in Dutch). Keukenhof’s modern gardens were designed in 1949 by father and son landscape architects Louis Paul and Jan Davis Zocher to act as a showcase for growers of The Netherland’s main export: flowers. With a vast, exciting assortment of hybrid blooms hitting the market for the first time, the idea for Keukenhof Gardens was born. A father and son design team of Louis Paul and Jan Davis Zocher united several gardens in varying styles to display the vast, exciting assortment of Holland’s new hybrid blooms set to flood markets for the first time. Ever since, from March through May, beds of tulips, crocuses, hyacinths, daffodils, and more have run like rivers beneath its trees. Each of the bulb flower varieties that paint the Keukenhof landscape has its own peak blooming time: crocuses are the first ones to appear, followed by vibrant daffodils, fragrant hyacinths and finally, the tulips which are at their best around mid-April. Like many of the world’s horticultural giants, visitors return year after year to see Keukenhof’s annual theme executed in living blooms; others return for perennial joys like the floating nature garden, the country Japanese garden, or the enclosed historical garden that displays the blooms of rare, heirloom cultivars. Each of the six glass pavilions that dot the park hosts a show that revolves around one flower variety. The whisper boat, which is berthed near the historic mill, takes visitors on a tour around the bulb fields that frame the Keukenhof Gardens.",horticulture landscapes flora plants
62,De Waag,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Amsterdam's former hotspot for public executions and dissections.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/de-waag,"Once a hotspot for public executions and dissections during the Golden Age, the medieval and castle-like “Weigh House” is now a global center for bio-hacking. Once upon a time in 1488, De Waag was built as one of Amsterdam’s main city gates—which closed every night exactly at 9:30 p.m. to keep out the bandits, the poor, and the desperately diseased. By the 17th century, when the city expanded due to its foreign fields of trade (and plunder), the building was rebranded as a weighing house for incoming products: tobacco, ropes, spices, artillery, slave chains etc. Towers were built to accommodate various municipal militias and guilds, including one for the masons who did all the evocative decorations over the various entrances. Another tower housed the Surgeons’ Guild and its Theatrum Anatomicum (Anatomy Theater) that hosted public dissections (mostly of criminals who had just been executed outside) and formed the setting for Rembrandt’s famed The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp. So it’s squishingly fitting that this tower is now home to Fablab and its famed Bio-hacking Academy and Wetlab (open to the public on Thursdays between 4 and 8 p.m.). At one time during WWII, the whole square was barb-wired off to enclose Jews awaiting transport to concentration camps. Now it’s transformed into an upscale restaurant in the middle of a square at Nieuwmarkt.",

Sitting in the middle of the historic town of Maastricht in the Netherlands, the church has been a place for both pilgrimage and storage down the centuries. When it was active as a Catholic church the ornate naves and intricate stonework must have served as a glorious backdrop to masses. Unfortunately during Napoleon Bonaparte’s invasion in 1794 he saw the tall arched ceiling and grand, open chapel as a terrific storage solution. The leader used the church to house equipment and personnel during his campaign and simply abandoned the space when he was finished. After the diminutive dictator’s deconsecration of the space it went on to act as a warehouse, an archival space, and more contemporarily, a place to keep bikes. It was not until 2005 that a team of modern architects renovated the space, adding a massive three-story central shelving island among other commercial enhancements, transforming the cavernous space into the Selexyz Dominicanen bookstore that stands today. The store continues to operate today despite the biblical friction concerning commerce in churches, holding a large selection of books on its black steel shelves and incorporating elements of the historic church such as a large cross-shaped table.",napoleon bonaparte bookstores books churches sacred spaces
64,Windmills of Kinderdijk,"Kinderdijk, Netherlands","Birthplace of the ""Cat in the Cradle"" and a cluster of iconic, original windmills that let the Dutch tame the seas.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/windmills-of-kinderdijk,"Think “Holland” and you’ve probably already conjured the iconic images of tulips and windmills. More precisely, the very specific windmills you’re envisioning right now are that of Kinderdijk. Though it may sound odd for how technical and pragmatic the region proved to be, the name Kinderdijk translates in Dutch to mean “children’s dike.” According to local legend, after a particularly terrible flood in the 15th century, a lone basket was left floating in an inundated canal. Upon closer inspection, a cat was found bounding from one side of the basket to the other in an effort to keep it balanced, for inside rested an orphaned baby. The cat had kept the babe afloat, safe and sound during its journey… Thus giving the world the folktale “The Cat and the Cradle” in addition to the village of Kinderdijk its name. Back in the modern day, visitors will find 19 historically authentic windmills scattered across Kinderdijk’s canal-riddled landscape. With their sails raised to the skies (coming to rest in formations that communicate across the bogs in a language of semafors), one could be forgiven for believing these are creatures beholden to the air. What history reveals, in fact, is that the Netherlands’ famous windmills are well-disguised creatures of the sea, without which the nation’s famously innovative water management system would not have been possible. Sometime in the 13th century, Zuid-Holland’s peat rivers ceased to drain as they had been, creating a pattern of flooding that devastated the beautiful landscape at Alblasserwaard, which already existed below sea level. Berms were built to prevent flooding, but pumping stations needed to be constructed to continue water flow from low to high areas; hence, the 19th windmills still seen today. Nowhere else in the world offers a complete portrait of early water management like that of Kinderdijk, which accounts for UNESCO’s inclusion of the site among its World Heritage as of 1997 for its “unique character.” Thanks to its truly groundbreaking unification of sea and sky, plus the added bonus of a world-renowned folktale, a visit to Kinderdijk is the sort of treasure that offers something for dreamers and pragmatists alike.",folktales windmills unesco engineering
65,Mozesbrug (Moses Bridge),"Halsteren, Netherlands","Invisible bridge parts the waters, invoking biblical images and preserving the ominous feel of an ancient moat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moses-bridge-moat-fortress,"Once an active defense-line dating back to the 17th century, the West Brabant Line is made up of fortresses and cities with an inundation zone to the north, used as moats deep enough to dissuade marauders on foot, but too shallow to allow for boats. The line fell into disrepair in the 19th century, but a recent restoration program has been in motion, which led to this peculiar “invisible” bridge. Fort de Roovere is the largest fort on the line, and particular attention has been paid to transform it into a recreational area for cycling and hiking. Not wanting to disrupt the appearance of the moat by adding an obviously ill-advised bridge, but needing a bridge for access regardless of a yearning for historical accuracy the Moses Bridge was the miracle solution. The bridge, made completely out of waterproof wood, lies like a trench and disappears into the landscape, but from the vantage point of above or either end, the bridge parts the waters, reminiscent of the prophet it named after. In the case that you are lacking the faith to walk down into and under the water line, the RO&AD architects who designed the bridge assure that flooding would not be an issue. The height of the water is controlled by adjustable dams at both sides of the moat, ensuring that when the water rises, it reaches the dams before the bridge, which also includes a pump just in case the dams overflow. The discreet entry to the fort makes it possible to enjoy the area without ruining the moat’s presence, and gives you the powerful impression that the waters have parted, just for you.",outsider architecture architectural oddities architecture
66,Cube Houses,"Rotterdam, Netherlands",These slanted cubic abodes are a creative if odd solution to a zoning pickle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cube-house,"Straddled above roads and intertwined amongst themselves, Rotterdam’s string of cube houses, each tilted at an abnormal angle of 55 degrees, have stunned every commuter to ever exit the adjacent Blaak Train Station. In the 1970s, the city planners of Rotterdam in the Netherlands had a problem. Small pieces of land on both the northwest and southeast sides of Blaak Street were zoned as residential, but they had to be somehow connected. Thinking on its feet, the city consulted architect Piet Blom to devise a way to build a housing complex as a bridge over a road. Blom’s answer was the Cube House. With 38 regular cube houses and two “super-cubes”, each slanted cubic residence is held up by a hexagonal pillar, some of which are located atop a pedestrian bridge spanning the four-lane Blaak Street. While it solved the urban planning problem, it also created some highly interesting residences in the process. Living in the cube house is much like an experience on a sailboat. Each cube house contains about 1,080 square feet of floor space. After entering on the ground level, a staircase (which can vary from one flight to three flights, depending on the location of the cube) to reach the first floor, a triangle-shaped room that features a living room, dining area, bathroom, a space often used as an office and a kitchen. A flight of stairs up are two bedrooms and a bathroom, and the top floor is a loft area. Most of the cubes have doors on the second floor that connect to one or two other cubes via a small “terrace”. Designer Piet Blom created the cube houses as an urban forest, known as the “Blaakse Bos” (the forest on Blaak), with each cube house and it’s pillar forming one “tree”. The homes as a whole are a registered monument of the City of Rotterdam and an unmistakable landmark that represents the more modern spirit of the city itself. The cubes are privately owned by a small and active group of homeowners from the Netherlands as well as Peru, France, the United States and China.  In recognition of its unique and eye-catching architecture, one of the cube houses has been converted into a museum, which, for a small fee, is open to the public every day from 11am to 5pm.",gardens houses homes plants architecture
67,Amsterdam Tulip Museum,"Amsterdam, Netherlands","Tucked in the back of a flower shop, its collection details the fascinating history of the Netherlands's iconic symbol.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amsterdam-tulip-museum,"This is no ordinary flower shop or tourist stop. Tucked in the back of the flower store is a small museum that details the history of the Netherlands’s iconic symbol. The tulip has a strong association with the Netherlands, as it’s the country’s national symbol. People come from around the world to see the country’s massive tulip fields. But many are unaware that the tulip isn’t even native to the Netherlands—they’re originally from the Himalayas. The Ottomans were filling gardens with tulips by the 15th century. The plant made its way to the Netherlands around the 16th century, where its popularity flourished. Seen as a symbol for the rich, the beautiful flowers would sometimes sell for prices significantly higher than the average person’s annual average salary. Of course, this was not sustainable, and the tulip market soon crashed. It took about 200 years for the tulip market to recover, and recover it did. The Dutch began cultivating tulips in great numbers, and continue to do so to this day. All this and much more can be learned at the Amsterdam Tulip Museum, which is housed in the back of a tulip shop in central Amsterdam.  The flower shop itself is free to enter, and sells various rare kinds of bulbs and souvenirs, sometimes even edible bulbs. The museum entrance is in the back of the shop.

Walking through the exhibits halls filled with artifacts from the anatomical, medical, and scientific history of the Netherlands, visitors are reminded that they are mere mortals—literally. Latin phrases meant to inspire contemplation of one’s own mortality are held up by a series of articulated skeletons: We are but dust and shadow. Life is short. Remember you must die. The museum, which is named for Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738), a Dutch physician and botanist, displays over 400 years of advances in knowledge in a building that dates back to the 1500s. Originally the St. Caecilia nunnery, then a “plague hospital and madhouse,” the historic building was converted to a university hospital in 1653. In 1720, Herman Boerhaave gave a famous series of lectures known as the “sickbed lessons,” marking the beginning of clinical teaching and of the academic hospital in its modern form. In 1991, the St. Caecilia nunnery took its current form as a museum, where displays of human pathology bring to mind a different sort of “life after death”—that of the medical specimen. The museum also contains a wonderful collection of antique scientific instruments, natural history displays, and an old operating theater.",two headed animals anatomical theaters pharmacy museums insane asylums anatomy museums wonder cabinets strange science medical museums instruments of science collections museums
69,Fort Bourtange,"Bourtange, Netherlands",This beautifully designed star-shaped fort was the premier defense system of the late 1500s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-bourtange,"Star forts, five-sided forts designed to give guards a panoramic view of any potential attackers, originated in Italy in the 15th century. Providing the optimal structure for protection from threats, star forts were used in Italian warfare for years and eventually diffused to the Groningen region of the Netherlands, where the Bourtange star fort was constructed in 1593. The star fort was a premier defense system throughout the Netherlands and the perfect force for Fort Bourtange. The fort remains perfectly preserved, with historic churches, cobblestone streets, wooden windmills, marvelous bridges, and old military barracks strewn across the 11-acre pentagon. Originally constructed by William the Silent to aid the Dutch in the Eighty Years’ War, Bourtange was strategically surrounded by a marshy moat and complete with sturdy fortifications for defense against the Spaniards. Years later, when the German army of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster attacked in 1672, the army was crippled by the impassable swamp that surrounded the fort. Fort Bourtange was a military success for years, until agricultural practices dried up the fort’s protective swamp. In response, Bourtange converted itself into a non-military residential town by 1851, where life flourished for nearly 100 years. By the 1950s and ’60s, however, Bourtange saw a second wave of troubles as job growth began to stagnate, forcing the local government to declare Bourtange an open-air historical area by 1960. Among the fort’s three historical rooms and museums is a 19th-century synagogue that was the place of worship for Bourtange’s Jews before Adolf Hitler’s invasion of the region. Historical reenactments are common; every June, the Battle of Bourtange is recreated at the fort, the largest reenactment in the Netherlands. Torture devices can also be found throughout Bourtange, including the Wooden Horse, in which a prisoner would sit atop the back of a manmade horse and have weights tied to their feet. Today, Bourtange is one of the Netherland’s most fascinating and unique historical areas, a moat-surrounded village where you can literally walk atop a star.",preservation forts military history war history military architectural oddities architecture

The tall, stark house in the canal belt, a UNESCO World Heritage site, was originally built in the early 1670s for soap manufacturer and businessman, Gijsbert Dumber, although the original owner is hardly remembered today. Although it is sometime known as the Gijsbert Dumber Huis, it is far better known as the “The House with The Blood Stains” thanks to one Coenraad van Beuningen. Van Beuningen was a six-time mayor of Amsterdam and a successful ambassador by the time he moved into Amstel 216. Unfortunately, despite all of his political achievements and social status, van Beuningen’s mind began to falter in his final years. It’s said that van Beuningen may have suffered from bipolar disorder, but the cause is unclear. At the height of this illness, van Beuningen began painting arcane Kabbalistic signs on the lined gray facade of his building. The rumor was that he was painting them in his own blood. The marks are much faded but can still be seen on the outside of the private residence by eagle-eyed visitors. It is only rumored that the paint was van Beuningen’s actual blood, but whether or not this is true, it certainly looks like it. This building is private property so please be respectful.

The Speelklok (which translates to “musical clock”) has been around since 1958, spawned from an exhibition of self-playing musical contraptions just a couple of years previous. Originally the dinging, clicking, melody-making collection was presented in a portion of a church, but thanks to a group known (awesomely) as the “Friends of the Mechanical Organ” the permanent exhibition was grown and eventually relocated to its current location in a medieval building in 1984. Across the sprawling collection of self-playing instruments are massive mechanical boxes with moving figures to accompany the tunes, intricate clockwork inventions that can play a violin buried in its innards, and a number of iconic Dutch “street organs” that use a forest of pipes to delight and entertain. There are also a number of smaller musical oddities such as music boxes, pianolas, and self-ringing carillons rounding out the delightful collection. In addition to the whimsical devices on display in the museum, the center is the world leader in repair and restoration of historic musical automata.

73,Six Collection,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",A rare tour of an aristocrat's private home reveals valuable 17th-century paintings from artists like Rembrandt.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/six-collection,"The city of Amsterdam is not wanting for art museums or valuable collections. Sure, you can visit renowned sites like Rembrandt’s House, Our Lord in the Attic, or the Rijksmuseum. But the Six Collection has something these other popular spots lack: Its rare paintings are held within a house with real people still living in it. During the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th century, collecting art became a fashionable activity. Famous artists like Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Steen flourished during this era, and their masterpieces were hot commodities. It was during this time that Jan Six, a member of a particularly wealthy Amsterdam family, began amassing a collection of valuable work still coveted to this day. His stock of paintings, drawings, and other artistic artifacts was passed down throughout the generations, eventually growing to become the Six Collection as it appears today. To get an idea of the magnitude of the family’s wealth and influence, you have to keep in mind that some of the paintings are portraits of the Six family done by Rembrandt himself. But apparently, the family wasn’t sitting atop an unlimited fortune. Due to the increasing costs of maintaining their enormous collection, the Six family eventually had to ask for financial help from the Dutch government. In exchange for the subsidy they were granted, the family was asked to open their lavish home to visitors who wanted to see the artwork. Visiting the collection is a bit of a strange experience. As it’s still held within a private home, it’s possible to bump into a resident—typically a descendant of Jan Six himself—in the middle of their breakfast or just after they’ve woken up. Entering the house to view the artwork offers a fascinating glimpse of how the Netherlands’ wealthy, aristocratic families live. Snagging a reservation to visit is a rare treat, making this collection one of the city’s best-guarded treasures. Update: Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Six Collection is not accepting appointment requests until 2022.  Remember to book several months in advance. It is only possible to visit the house during weekdays in the morning. Even if you can't snag a spot, you can try to see some of the most famous pieces during the months they're lent to the Rijksmuseum.",wealth art history places to stay houses homes collections art

Known as Kasteelruine Fluweelengrot, in English it translates roughly to the Castle Ruins and the Velvet Cave. The history of the castle at Valkenburg began centuries before it was reduced to ruins, back in 1115.  The castle is unique for the Netherlands in that it sits on a hill, and although it was a strategic choice of location, the original fortification was destroyed soon after it was built. So it was rebuilt – and destroyed again. The current castle dates to the 14th century, and almost made it intact. It suffered its ruination in the late 16th and early 17th centuries during the Eighty Years War with Spain. By 1672 it was a shambles, attacked one last time at the outset of the Franco-Dutch War. In order to keep it out of the hands of the French, the Dutch Republic finished the demolition job themselves, leaving the castle in about the same condition seen today. Underneath the Kasteelruine is a series of tunnels, corridors and passageways dating back to the earliest fortification of the hill. Known as the Velvet Cave (Fluweelengrot in Dutch), it was started by masons and miners cutting out blocks of marlstone for constructing the castle and other buildings in Valkenburg. Over time the labyrinth grew, with tunnels used as secret passages for the castle up above. Serving as both hiding places and escape routes during various attacks and occupations, many of the tunnels weren’t discovered until 1937. In 1944 the Velvet Cave served as a refuge to hundreds of citizens of Valkenburg during World War II, as American troops dislodged German occupiers from the region. These American soldiers etched their names, hometowns and doodles on the soft walls of the cave, still visible today. Also adorning the walls of the cave are drawings and carvings, many of them celebrating old legends and stories of Valkenburg and Limburg, evoking long-forgotten secrets that naturally haunt a ruined castle built atop a maze of secret passages. The ruins and cave are open to the public from April 1 through December 31. The hours for the ruins are generally 10am to 5:30pm, and the cave is by guided tour only, generally running from 11am to 4pm. Some dates have different open times, so check the website to be sure.

The reference point, called Amsterdam Ordnance Datum (which translates to Normaal Amsterdams Peil, or NAP), is the heart of the European network of national leveling networks. In other words, the NAP is the prime meridian of elevation. Though you wouldn’t know it while walking around the city, much of Amsterdam lies below sea level. In the 17th century the city of Amsterdam was built on wooden piles on soft peat ground on sand. In 1953, flooding in the western Province of Zeeland reached nearly 15 feet above the NAP. Measurements for the NAP were first taken in 1683 and 1684, and the point was originally indicated by a series of marker stones in various dikes and sluices in Amsterdam.

The remnants of the church, such as the astronomical clock and the intricate wooden podium, are now surrounded by armored fish ridden by peasants, bizarre flying creatures hanging in midair, and strange beasts placed down among the pews. The walls are also covered in tapestries and recreations of Bosch’s work. The rest of the church continues to delve into Bosch’s legacy. In the basement of the church there is a recreation of the painter’s studio. The tall church tower now houses a glass elevator that carries visitors up through levels of gallery space featuring more prints of Bosch’s work as well as work that was inspired by his sinister creations. While the center does not hold any of Bosch’s original works, it may be unrivaled in allowing people to truly inhabit his terrible visions of the afterlife.",monsters paintings churches sacred spaces art
81,The Resistance Museum,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",A poignant museum dedicated to the history of the Dutch resistance against Nazi occupation,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dutch-resistance-museum,"In the Plantage neighborhood of Amsterdam stands a museum that chronicles one of the darkest episodes of modern Dutch history; the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands and the heroic resistance that fought against it. The Dutch resistance to the Nazi occupation was largely a non-violent resistance movement that manifested in acts such as strikes, sabotage, the dissemination of clandestine anti-Nazi propaganda and literature, and protests. It was notable for the formation of the most successful organized networks in occupied Europe, which worked tirelessly and under great danger to provide safe houses to shelter and protect Jewish families from deportation to the concentration camps. The museum showcases these heroic efforts and the artifacts relating to the resistance movement. On display are printing presses to print posters and literature, equipment for forging official documents, satirical cartoons poking fun at the Nazi occupiers, labor/union strike propaganda, underground newspapers and literature, a stolen and vandalized bust of Hitler, and displays relating to the networks that hid and protected Jews from deportation to the concentration camps. However, there were several resistance groups in the Netherlands that, like those in France, Italy, and Greece, waged an active violent resistance against the Nazi occupiers (with allied logistical support). The museum showcases several clandestine radios used for communication between resistance groups and allied forces, which include both the larger variety of radio sets and smaller examples that are hidden in tobacco tins and matchboxes. On display are the weapons used by such resistance fighters in operations to assassinate German troops and Nazi officers such as pistols, grenades, and Sten machine guns, as well as weapons used in hand-to-hand combat such as commando and stiletto knives. Here too can be seen the ingenious methods used by the resistance to conceal weapons such as prams with false bottoms used to stash pistols and grenades and even books and chocolate boxes with secret compartments that conceal pistols with silencers. For the heroic individuals involved in the resistance in the Netherlands, the risks were huge and the dangers posed by the counter-intelligence of the Gestapo and the SS were enormous. It is estimated that approximately 2,000 members of the resistance were to be killed by the German occupiers or sent to their deaths in the concentration camps and the museum does an excellent job of revealing the tragic stories of those who were caught by the Nazis.  The museum is open on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. The entrance fee costs €13.00.",propaganda holocaust protest nazis military history world war ii museums and collections
82,Witches' Weigh House,"Oudewater, Netherlands",The giant scales in this museum can still tell if someone is one of the devil's brides just by weight.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/witches-weigh-house,"In the small Netherlands town of Oudewater there is a historic weigh house not unlike a number of similar buildings around the Netherlands, except this one is known primarily for weighing witches. A weigh house was a common feature of medieval townships, used as a central site where people could come to weigh their crops and livestock. They were generally publicly run, used to levy tax amounts on goods as well. As witch hunts became a popular hysteria, they also became the perfect spots to subject the accused to a witchcraft test. Witches were thought to be light enough to float on water, and a common test of, uh, witchitude, was to put the accused on the weigh house scale and see the results. They were generally rigged and countless innocents burned or drowned thanks to the superstitious test. The weigh house in Oudewater was a bit different, as it was said to have been approved as a fair weighing site by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Thanks to the this, no one is thought to have gone to the stake from its scales. They were originally built in 1482, and the witch weights didn’t begin being tabulated until the 16th century. Today the weigh house is a museum devoted to the site’s history. Known as the Museum de Heksenwaag, visitors can come and weigh themselves, receiving certificates that prove they are not witches. If only so many of history’s weigh houses could have had such fun programs.

Sitting on a two-story platform beside an eleven story glass building, this towering orange man welcomes you to the Corpus Museum, the world’s first museum to take visitors through the entire anatomy of the human body. The giant orange body at the Corpus Museum is cut in its center by the glass walls of the building, making it appear to be a silhouette. In reality, the orange man is a full body resting half inside and half outside of the museum. The sculpture immediately catches the eye of cars passing down Leiden’s A44 Highway, beckoning them to the unusual museum. The Corpus Museum’s hour-long tour begins with an escalator ride up the leg to the knee, where visitors will step inside an open wound. Next comes the genital area, where visitors will put on 3D glasses to witness a sperm cell fertilizing an egg. Farther up the giant body come the intestines, where you can witness the digestion of a cheese sandwich before your eyes. After passing through the ventricles of the human heart, visitors reach the head. Here, adults can observe pulsing neurons in the brain, while children can jump atop a giant tongue as a burping sound erupts from a speaker system. The museum’s upper floor features multiple interactive activities and a cafeteria.

Famous for its flora and animals, the Wadden Sea is an animal lover’s paradise. Home to thousands of birds, harbor seals, dolphins, and whales, it’s said that some regionally extinct species can still be found in the waters. Formed back in the 14th and 15th centuries by storms, the Wadden Sea landscape is the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world, according to the Unesco World Heritage. In fact, Wadden is derived from the Dutch word ‘wad,’ which translates to mud flats. As part of the landscape, the Wadden Sea is host to a series of islands known collectively as the Frisian Islands or the Wadden Islands. In the Netherlands, there are five islands—Texel, Terschelling, Vlieland, Ameland, and Schiermonnikoog—to visit. Today, the islands are popular for “wadlopen” or mud flat walking. At low tide, nature-lovers can literally walk on the Wadden Sea, between islands, spotting lazy grey seals en route. A veritable mecca for nature, this area offers hiking and cycling trails, dunes, beaches, and ample wildlife.  During the warmer months, island hopping is available via boats and tours. Easy ferry connections between the five main islands of Texel, Terschelling, Vlieland, Ameland, and Schiermonnikoog make it easy to explore each island's distinct personality and offerings. While some of the islands are largely uninhabited, some are home to small towns. Den Burg is the largest town on the island of Texel, with available accommodations, including Hotel Texel in the center of town.

While it is built to make you lose your orientation, it also fulfills you with the immense joy of discovering something new. Entering the Meta Maze, you will find a sheer multitude of surreal rooms where you can dive through dream-like landscapes, profoundly strange spaces, and flabbergasting art pieces, all integrated into one big opus. It’s sometimes dark, but never made to frighten the visitor, but rather encourage them to pause and marvel. Some visitors say they even found themselves in this surreal labyrinth. And yes, there is an exit, too, but take your time, as there’s surely enough to discover inside. Words cannot do it justice; it’s something you need to see with your own eyes. The Meta Maze was created by the Berlin-based artist platform Karmanoia. This walkthrough installation comes on the heels of the group’s previous maze, “Peristal Singum,” which was a popular and true underground place in Berlin. The Meta Maze is nested into a larger event space called Doloris. On the rooftop, there is a bar and restaurant serving splendid street food and providing a fabulous scenic view over the city of Tilburg.  Inside, phones and cameras are strictly not admitted—they will remain in a lockable pouch or locker. This is a wise decision. It gives you the opportunity to go on this adventure more consciously and take a closer look at the art. The maze is not suitable for small children and people with difficulties to climb, crouch or be in small spaces. You can find the Meta Maze at Doloris right by Tilburg's central train station, which makes it easy to get there from other places in the Netherlands.",labyrinths mazes art
86,Kremlin of the Netherlands,"Winkel, Netherlands",This miniature take on the Kremlin is one Dutch man's retirement project.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kremlin-of-the-netherlands,"What is the Kremlin doing in a Dutch town of less than 3,000 people? Only one man really knows, but he’ll be happy to show you around. Ger Leegwater, a retired sheet metal worker, began building this colorful installation in 1990, just outside the town of Winkel in the Dutch province of North Holland. Leegwater is not an architect, he’s just an enthusiast. While the bulbous domes and bright colors of his project invite comparison to the Russian Kremlin, this is not quite a replica. Instead, inspired by classical and Russian Orthodox architecture, Leegwater began using his newly-acquired free time to coax sheet metal and recycled materials into something he was excited about. Looking like something out of a Russian fairy tale, complete with towers, gates and arches, the project includes several freestanding pieces. The central tower-like structure of the complex measures a full 45 feet wide, 52 feet long, and 33 feet high. There’s also a small chapel, which is available for marriage ceremonies. Leegwater is apparently not one to skimp on detail, and he has gone the whole nine yards with decorative elements - each onion-like dome is crowned by a emblem, be it a star, a cross, or a sickle and hammer. Later additions to what has become known as the “Kremlin of the Netherlands” include sculptures of mythical and religious figures, from Saint George and the Dragon to Orpheus. The site is open for visitors by appointment, or anytime that Leegwater has placed the “open” sign on the front gate.",mythology outsider architecture outsider art

Keep a sharp eye out for the intriguing images, and you’ll learn more about the various homes and business they adorn than you ever would from merely reading a house number or address. These gable stones (gevelstenen in Dutch) originally served a practical purpose. In the days before houses were numbered and the general population could read, the signs used images to represent the name of a homeowner or purpose of a business. The colorful plaques had a range of styles. Some were rather straightforward; for example, one gable stone depicting a man reaching a hand into another person’s mouth marked the location of a dentist. Others were more whimsical and, at times, even punny. Quite a few of the stones had pious undertones, with religious images denoting the homeowner’s faith. After houses became numbered in the 19th century, the gable stones lost their practical purposes. But still, the tradition of these artistic signs continues to this day, as they’re still celebrated decorations. There are still hundreds of these plaques throughout Amsterdam and new ones are still being commissioned, creating a wonderful blend of new and old signs sprinkled around the city.  The signs are spread throughout the city.

The museum was founded in 1975 and resides in the Cromhaut houses, two canal-side buildings with a history of their own. The museum’s collection has a rich history, making a visit enjoyable for anyone, regardless of religious belief. The museum contains an impressive collection of Bibles, including the oldest Bible printed in the Netherlands as well as the first edition of the 1637 Dutch Authorized Version. One can also find an exact copy of a Dead Sea Scroll that contains the Book of Isaiah. There is also a fair share of archaeological objects too, including oil lamps, coins, pottery, tablets and pottery shards from ancient Egypt. Visitors will also find old models of religious temples as well as a 19th-century model of the Tabernacle, a reconstruction of a sacred shrine mentioned in the Bible. The Cromhaut houses themselves were built in 1662 by a renowned architect by the name of Philips Vingboons. The architecture is rich and radiates with history.

91,Efteling Sprookjesbos,"Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands",This fairy tale forest hides scenes from some of the more obscure and bizarre Western nursery stories.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/efetling-sprookjesbos,"While Sprookjesbos has grown to be simply a part of the Netherlands’ largest theme park (and one of the oldest in the world), the scenes from fairytales both classic and obscure still remain to delight and unsettle visitors. Long before it evolved into the sprawling Efteling theme park that now surrounds it, the fairy tale forest attraction was just a collection of dummies and mannequins posed in fantasy scenes from popular fables. Opened in 1952 the ten original scenes were sculpted and modeled after the illustrations of Dutch artist Anton Pieck, whose fanciful works notably contained a certain darkness akin to that found in many European fairytales. The displays managed to translate that darkness well, providing a slightly sinister, lost-in-the-dark-woods feel. The original set of tableaus contained scenes from such popular stories as Snow White and Sleeping Beauty as well as lesser known tales such as Mother Hulda’s Well and The Frog King. Some of the figures in the scenes were animated with early mechanical effects, and each scene had a voice-box or book that would tell the story associated with it. Since its inception the collection of scenes continued to grow, building moments from stories ranging from Little Red Riding Hood to The Indian Water Lillies. Each new scene maintained Pieck’s signature style, even as the technology evolved, and even as older fairytale scenes were updated and replaced. Today there are a total 28 scenes, each culled from the fairy tale greats such as Hans Christian Anderson and The Brothers Grimm. And just like the original stories, they continue to prove just a little creepy.  From Amsterdam/Utrecht: take the train to ’s-Hertogenbosch, where bus connections are available to Efteling. From Breda: take the train to Tilburg, where bus connections are available to Efteling (300, 301, 800, 801). Currently, ticket prices range from €25/$30 (evening ticket) to €45/$53 (all-year-round). These tickets allow access to the entire park. It is possible to stay overnight at the Efteling Hotel, or one of its resorts Bosrijk and Loonse Land.",fairytales amusement parks
92,Pyramid of Austerlitz,"Woudenberg, Netherlands",A grassy pyramid named after a French battle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-of-austerlitz,"Built by the French army in 1804, this landmark in the heart of the Netherlands is modeled after the Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt.  Just a few years after its construction, the name was changed to commemorate Napoleon’s victory in the 1806 Battle of Austerlitz. The original pyramid, which was made of earth and sand terraces in just 27 days, didn’t survive very long, quickly eroded by unforgiving weather conditions. The original needle atop the hill was made of wood, but met the same end as the original earthen construction, strong winds and rain quickly demolishing the obelisk. Finally, a stone spire was constructed,  but initial efforts to keep the man-made hill in good repair were met with continual setbacks, and the pyramid fell into disrepair for much of the 20th century. Luckily, in the early 2000’s restoration of the monument began, and the current pyramid is composed of lush grass-covered steps leading up to the crowning obelisk. While the structure is still quite delicate, thanks to the placement of a metal framework visitors can actually climb the central staircase up to the obelisk. The Pyramid of Austerlitz is currently a popular tourist attraction surrounded by a fun fair, cafe and other modern amenities.  The pyramid is easily reached by car.

It is a model of a Dutch town on a 1:25 scale, composed of typical Dutch buildings and landmarks, as are found at various locations in the country. This major Dutch tourist attraction was built in 1952 and has been visited by tens of millions of visitors since then. The miniature city was named after George Maduro, a law student from Curaçao who fought the Nazi occupation forces as a member of the Dutch resistance and died at Dachau concentration camp in 1945. In 1946 Maduro was posthumously granted the honor of Knight 4th-class of the Military Order of William, the highest and oldest honor in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, because he had distinguished himself in the Battle of the Netherlands against German troops. His parents donated the money to start the Madurodam project. On July 2, 1952, a teenaged princess named Beatrix was appointed mayor of tiny Madurodam, after which she was given a tour of her town, which only took a few minutes. While she started small, Beatrix went on to big things and became the Queen Regnant of the Netherlands in 1980. When Beatrix became Queen of the Netherlands, she relinquished her function as mayor of Madurodam. Today, the mayor of Madurodam is elected by a youth municipal council consisting of 25 pupils from schools in the region.",small worlds and model towns

This is why most airports are full of clocks everywhere, helping to guide harried travelers. Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands is no exception, but it offers a twist: a giant clock that appears as if a man is busy painting it real time, minute by minute. The painter is actually a 12-hour-long recording, that gives a convincing illusion that a human is standing inside the translucent clock, busy at work as the hands go around. This creative timepiece is the latest work of Maarten Baas, a well-known Dutch artist and designer that has a series of similar live clock recordings. The Schiphol Airport clock was created by Baas in 2016. The man inside the clock is wearing blue overalls and has a yellow rag in his pocket. This, together with his red bucket, is meant to be an homage to the famous Dutch artist Mondrian. The clock can be seen in the airport’s International terminal, so it is only visible to people leaving the European Union via Schiphol, and not, unfortunately, for travelers simply hopping between cities.

Eventually, nearby cities began opening their own fancy science centers, and attendance at Evoluon started to consistently decline year after year. In 1989, the spaceship-shaped, museum closed its doors, but fortunately that was not the end of its story. You can’t just let a good UFO building go to waste.

The story of Apenheul started back in the late 1960s when Rotterdam-based photographer Wim Mager gave up his profession in favor of developing a more human living concept for his two pet tamarins. At the time, owning primates was still legal and purchasing the animals was common in local pet stores. But it occured to Mager that a happier, more natural environment for the animals would return in the form of a happier exprience for all who encountered them. What resulted from this epiphany became the totally revolutionary Apenheul Primate Park still in operation today. It started simply: Apenheul would be a zoo without bars, beginning with a few smaller species including spider monkeys and woolly monkeys. Throughout the following decades, the reserve’s inhabitants have expanded to more than 70 species of monkeys (more than 30 of which are primates) including howler monkeys, orangutans, gorillas, and marmosets to name just a few. Though Mager’s initial revelation may seem obvious to us today, without the work of Mager and his contemporaries it’s unlikely this would seem so. Strolling through this totally unique park, rubbing shoulders with our furry little cousins, provides an excellent reminder of just how far we’ve come – and how far we have yet to go – in understanding human-animal relationships in so short a time.",monkeys zoos animals

What many people don’t realize is that their narrowness is a 17th-century form of tax evasion. During the Dutch Golden Age, there was an arms race of sorts among the rich merchants of Amsterdam. They were buying land in the city and constructing houses that demonstrated their wealth. The city took notice and capitalized by establishing a new tax based on the facade of houses. The broader the facade, the higher the tax. However, what the government didn’t expect was for its citizens to get creative. Many quickly realized that a narrow house with more depth was much cheaper. One merchant took this process to the extreme, constructing a house with a facade of just over two meters, barely wider than a standard door. One would think this leaves very little space for anything, however once inside, the house actually broadens, and is about five meters deep. The house is now known across the globe as the house with the narrowest facade.  The house is occupied and is best viewed from a public location.",taxes buildings architectural oddities

In honor of the uprising, a bizarre space-age monument and memorial complex was constructed 70 years later. If the artist and the surrounding memorial park didn’t state explicitly that the building was in honor of the Ilinden Uprising, it stands to reason that no one would ever make the connection. The Makedonium almost looks like a heart valve, except it’s white and has around 10 massive stained-glass skylights poking out from its circular base. In North Macedonia, it has become a symbol of statehood, even making it onto the national currency on the 10,000 Denari bill. It overlooks the town of Kruševo from over 4,000 feet, which makes it fairly prominent, but that’s where the symbolism ends. There are no statues of soldiers holding a flag or grand statements of statehood. There is only a weird African-cucumber shaped modernist expression of freedom. Maybe that’s the point of the monument, it is looking toward the future, where free expression meets innovation without the stifling influence of a crumbling Turkish empire. There are probably no right answers, but a trip to the Makedonium will at the very least allow visitors to overlook a beautiful and well-preserved medieval town while they scratch their heads in confusion.

99,Kokino Observatory,North Macedonia,"This 3,800-year-old site contains markers used to study the movement of the sun and moon and create a lunar calendar.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kokino-observatory,"The science of observing the sky and measuring time based on its changes is almost as old as civilization itself. Many early  societies had their own calendars, and archaeologists continue to find evidence of this at various sites. In 2001, the ruins of a Bronze Age settlement were found outside the small North Macedonian village of Kokino. Amid the signs of occupation like pieces of vessels and weapons, researchers also discovered giant stones arranged in puzzling patterns, at an elevation of over 3,300 feet. With further study, they identified these as stone markers used to track the patterns of the sun and the moon, making the site an ancient megalithic observatory, dating back nearly 3,800 years. Two platforms, separated by a height of around 62 feet, are located at the center of the observatory’s remains. Four massive stone thrones, facing the direction of the east, make up the lower platform. The higher platform consists of markers carved into malleable andesite rocks, that indicated significant astronomical events like the summer and winter solstices, as well as the spring and autumn equinoxes. While seated on the thrones, particularly the second one, the exact movement of light during these days could be seen. The most powerful member of the community usually took his place on this special seat, and observed the light that streamed through the carved markers, and soaked in the energy of the sun. Rituals based on these solar changes were held at the observatory. Information about the change in seasons was conveyed through a huge fire, visible to people living in surrounding areas. The appearance of this blaze told people when it was time to start planting, ploughing, or harvesting, allowing them to plan their agricultural calendar. Their lunar calendars followed a 19-year cycle, where, for the first 12 years, each year had 12 months—6 summer months, and 6 winter months. The remaining 7 years were divided into 13 months each. Kokino, with its dual function as a scientific and ritual site, is of great interest to archaeoastronomy researchers, who study the sky-based rituals of ancient societies through the lens of anthropology and modern astronomy.",ancient technology bronze age observatories astronomy science history

The SIZ would decide how they want to channel the money they obtained (mostly through collective work efforts and direct donations from its members). Often the money would be used to fund something useful for the whole community. Many hotels, summer camps, and holiday resorts were built through the SIZ system. The Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia alone, while being one of the smaller Yugoslav republics, had five resorts dedicated to children’s activities. Tito’s Pioneers, named for Josip Broz Tito, a communist revolutionary and later president of Yugoslavia, was the largest among them. It covered an area of almost four square miles on the shore of Dojran Lake, near Николиќ (Nikolikj), a small village right next to Greece (without an official border crossing). The main town of Дојран (Dojran) is about 15 kilometers away, so Nikolikj stays relatively calm and unfrequented. Children from all over Yugoslavia were given the chance to stay for free in the avant-garde buildings of the idyllic resort. The complex rises out of the uncontaminated nature with harsh lines and raw material design typical for the architecture of that period. The facade clearly reveals the functions of the interior space, alternating between solid and transparent surfaces. The only decorations are the concrete monocle-shaped windows that offer each room a slightly different view from the round frames. Five identical arrow-shaped buildings that almost touch each other comprise the compound. Each unit has two wings of rooms and a central communal area. The camp was abandoned in the 1990s during the wars in Yugoslavia, but the locals of Nikolikj village still remember the period they call the “golden era,” when more than 300 locals were employed by the camp. Today it sits in ruins, nature slowly covering the place up. The complex is not guarded or secured in any way, so it is free and easy to access, but also potentially dangerous. Most of the windows are broken, which gives entrance to explore the interior. Everything that could be taken is already gone, with only the basic structure remaining. The Republic of Macedonia tried to auction off all the SIZ resorts in 2015, but the Little Pioneers Youth Camp didn’t have any takers.  It's completely abandoned and Nikolich is a very small village literally on the end of the road. The best option is to rent a car. Hitch-hiking might be an alternative because it's not far away from the Star Dojran, the main town on the lake.",resorts communism history
102,Skopje Hydrometeorological Service Building,"Skopje, North Macedonia",A solar-powered primary school inspires hope and experimentation in a country ripe for energy innovation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skopje-hydrometeorological-institute,"As debate and concern over carbon emissions increases around the world, it may in fact be smaller nations who are in the best position to transition from burning fossil fuels to alternative energy sources. Countries like North Macedonia are experimenting with widely distributed solar power, and initiating robust tax and economic incentives to support these efforts. At the Hydrometeorological Service Institute, part of a primary school in Skopje, North Macedonia, the roof is covered with solar panels in one of the first efforts to create a large-scale building with complex needs completely self-sufficient when it comes to energy. Massive government programs aren’t the goal of this experiment and others like it in North Macedonia. Rather, they, combined with hearty tax breaks for those who follow suit, are meant to be a proof of concept for individualized sustainability efforts on the small-scale. Homeowners all over the country struggle with obtaining heat and electricity, and using solar panels to supply part or all of that electricity would be a huge benefit to the individuals living there leading to a more sustainable North Macedonia overall. That’s a lot of hope to pin on one instance of solar-powered innovation, but if the Hydrometeorological Service is right about the impact of their program, it could eventually take North Macedonia past the wealthiest of nations in terms of per-capita sustainability.",inventions
103,Skopje Fortress,"Skopje, North Macedonia",This fortress dates back to the 6th century and is also the site of a controversial abandoned restoration project.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skopje-fortress,"Different iterations of the Skopje Kale (Kale being the Turkish word for fortress) have existed on this site since the 6th century. The fortress is located at the highest point of the city, overlooking the still waters of the Vardar River. The first fortress is thought to have been constructed during the reign of Emperor Justinian I. It was built from materials taken from the Roman city of Skupi after the city was destroyed by a massive earthquake in 518. However, very little is known about the early life of the fortress or what life was like inside the fortress or its garrison. Construction work continued on the fortress throughout the 10th and 11th centuries over the Byzantine remains. In 1346, while at the fortress Stefan Dušan crowned himself emperor, and appointed Skopje as the new capital of the Serbian Empire. Sometime during Ottoman rule, the fort fell into a state of neglect and was left completely empty. During the 19th century, warehouses, arsenals, a military hospital, and prison were discovered inside the fortress. The fortress was greatly damaged during another earthquake in 1963, which left most of the defensive towers and buildings in rubbles. In September 2010, the southwestern wall was restored. The completion of this work coincided with Macedonia’s Independence Day. During an excavation of the fortress, the foundation of a 13th-century church was discovered within the fortress. A project was announced to restore the ruins as a church/museum. Albanian groups belonging to the Democratic Union for Integration claimed that the site contained artifacts relating to their Illyrian ancestry, leading to a dispute over rights to the area and violent outbreaks. The project was eventually abandoned. Today many unfinished, now almost ruinous, building projects can be seen scattered across the fortress complex.  The fortress is located up a steep incline. There are many steps and areas of uneven ground throughout the complex.",fortresses roman castles architecture
104,Abandoned Hotel Evropa,"Oteshevo, North Macedonia",It's unclear what caused the fire that led to this opulent hotel's demise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-hotel-evropa,"Although Lake Ohrid receives the lion’s share of tourists in North Macedonia, Lake Prespa is a stone’s throw away, and it packs some historical sites for those who are willing to go off the beaten path. Marshal Tito was quite fond of Prespa Lake, which was the place where the borders of Southeast Europe were drawn in the aftermath of World War II. These were the borders that remained in place until the end of the Cold War. If those spomenik monuments scattered throughout the Balkans can be read as a sign of unrelenting optimism, Hotel Evropa can be seen as their post-communist counterpart. Following the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the pacification of the newly-born countries (circa 1992), optimism was in the air. It was a time of new opportunities and hope for a prosperous future. The sheer size and architectural boldness of Hotel Evropa epitomize this sense of rebirth. Its location further corroborates this idea: far from the touristy route and back to where history was made. The two angular arms forming the gate to the hotel epitomize the communist minimalism characteristic of spomenik monuments. The two arms are joined by a banner that still reads, ever so faintly, “Hotel Evropa.” Vegetation encroaches on the short road leading from the gate to the hotel, which has been neglected for years. There are uncertainties around the events that led to the hotel’s abandonment in 2005. What is certain is that a massive fire broke out in the kitchen. What is not clear is what caused the fire. Three hypotheses exist: Frying pans got overheated and caught fire; The electrical circuitry failed and a spark started the fire; The fire was started deliberately in order to defraud the insurance company. No one hypothesis is more credible than the others. Shortly after the fire, the hotel was abandoned and has been vandalized since then. Shattered glass and graffiti are ubiquitous. On the ground floor is the ballroom, which is easily recognizable by the number of smashed mirrors mounted on walls and pillars. A derelict bowling alley can be found in the basement. The upper floors can be reached through the main staircase, which is still in good shape. The upper rooms definitely commanded the best view of the lake, and they still do, but nowadays, what is really striking is the view of vegetation slowly but surely taking over the balconies on the lower floors. There are rumors that developers are set to demolish the hotel to make room for something snazzier, but in the meantime, Hotel Evropa is still there for those who are willing to dare to visit it.",hotels abandoned ruins

106,St Nicholas Church - Mavrovo,"Mavrovo, North Macedonia","Depending on the region's rainfall, this church may be partially submerged.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-nicholas-church-mavrovo,"Saying that St Nicholas Church (aka St. Nikolas) is located in Mavrovo is correct, but it may be confusing since Mavrovo can refer to a village, a lake, a valley, and a national park. Fortunately, the church is located in all of these entities. Movrovo village is on the shore of Movrovo Lake, along Mavrovo Valley, which is part of Mavrovo National Park. Mavrovo village is perched on the slopes of the Bistra Mountains overlooking Mavrovo Lake, an artificial body of water that was created in 1947 by damming the Mavrovo River. Once water filled the basin, some buildings were submerged. Only one of these buildings is still standing: St Nicholas Church. Although it’s roofless, the sturdy stone walls of St Nicholas Church have withstood the test of time. A solitary image of St Nicholas sits in the middle of the iconostasis behind the altar table. Two stands for votive candles are placed in front of the altar, and a couple of columns rest obliquely against the walls. The floor has significant dips and swells caused by years of flooding and exposure to the elements. There are no other items to speak of inside the church, except some random construction tools. A note to the hopefuls: the church is not always submerged. It depends on the amount of rainfall. In fact, the church has remained above the water level from 2019 to the present day. Even though it is not as scenic, an advantage of visiting the site when the church is not submerged is that one can enter the premise. The re-emergence of St. Nicholas Church after the flooding is seen by some believers as a sign that God is protecting the site.",churches history & culture architecture
107,Toše Proeski Memorial House,"Krusheva, North Macedonia",The cross-shaped memorial is filled with kitschy tributes to the late pop star.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tose-proeski-memorial-house,"If there’s one thing the Albanians, Macedonians, Roma, Aromanians, and other citizens of North Macedonia share, it’s the admiration they have for Toše Proeski, or at the very least, the sorrow caused by his early tragic death. Proeski, born 1981 in Krushevo to Aromanian parents, was a talented singer who enjoyed considerable success and fame across the Balkans with his numerous pop music hits. But the attention given to him skyrocketed after his untimely death in a car accident. Since he died, a sort of a Proeski-cult was created across the former Yugoslavia, celebrating not only his singing skills, but also his benevolent personality. It is no exaggeration to say that the Toše Proeski Memorial House in Kruševo is the epicenter of this “cult.” If Tošeism was a religion, this would be its cathedral. The building is appropriately shaped like a cross, inspired by the fact that Proeski was a believer. The shape of the building, however, is the least peculiar thing about it. The lonely guard, ticket vendor, and bartender give the whole place a Lynchesque vibe, but what really makes this place worth the visit is the collection. Somebody somehow managed to collect everything and anything related to Proeski’s life and put it all in one place in his hometown. And that means literally everything—cheap China-produced memorabilia, all of his medals and awards, all of his school diplomas, tons of fan mail, a lot of the objects he used to own (including a synthesizer, a motorbike, and a bicycle), and a huge number of photos of him. You’ll also spot several life-sized wax statues of questionable quality and his most famous quote (“I love you all”) printed in relief all over the walls of the memorial.  Free parking is available.

109,Xhamia e Larme,"Tetovo, North Macedonia",Artists made this mosque into a marvel of Ottoman baroque architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/xhamia-e-larme,"The exterior of Xhamia e Larme (Painted Mosque) mosque is adorned with illustrated, colorful rectangles that look like giant, artisanal playing cards, and the interior is no less intricate. According to an inscription above the main entrance to the mosque, the original Xhamia e Larme mosque was built in 1485, but it was destroyed in 1689 by a fire during a battle with Austrian forces. A newer version of Xhamia e Larme was built in 1833 under the aegis of Abdurrahman Pasha. Pasha expanded the mosque into a 10 meter-by-10 meter square. Out of respect for the minaret’s original orientation, builders placed the tower halfway through one of the structure’s side walls, rather than in the corner of the building as is custom. Thirty stained glass windows ring the mosque in an almost-symmetrical formation, letting colorful sunlight into the room and projecting patterns on the interior walls. To make the mosque appear symmetrical, artists painted a window on the wall where the minaret interrupts the place of an actual window. Given its age and architecture, Xhamia e Larme would have been remarkable in its own right, but the decorations make it a place of immense cultural and artistic value. Abdurrahman Pasha called on artists from Debar (Dibra in Albanian) to decorate both the interior and the exterior of the mosque. On the exterior walls between the wooden windows, they tastefully inserted intricate floral and geometric patterns divided into panes. A large six-point star stands out on the ceiling of the porch. The interior decorations are simply stunning. Floral and geometric motifs dominate, but the corbeled dome and the upper section of the walls also boast depictions of famous urban landscapes and twelve medallions with the exquisite, calligraphic names of twelve prophets.  Each front-facing upper window has an internal semi-circular balcony whose design is enhanced by rich and colorful decorations. At the back of Xhamia e Larme is a graveyard with ancient tombs.  The oldest ones date back to the 16th century, and they belong to Hurshide and Mensure, daughters of an Anatolian Pasha.",art history mosques islam paintings art history
110,Memorial House of Mother Teresa,"Skopje, North Macedonia","In the hometown of the Catholic saint and Nobel Peace Prize winner, a memorial dedicated to her legacy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memorial-house-of-mother-teresa,"Born in Skopje in 1910, Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu—who would go on to become Mother Teresa—became part of the Sisters of Loreto when she was 18 years old. Soon after joining this order, she was sent to India, where she took the vows as a nun in 1931. During this time, she was teaching geography and history at St. Mary’s High School in Calcutta. Visits to the slums made an impact on her, and in 1948, Mother Teresa received permission to start working with the most indigent people in Calcutta. The nature of the organization that Mother Teresa headed underwent different changes through the years, but the latest and most well-known is the Missionaries of Charity.  For the work she did, she won international recognition including the Noble Peace Prize in 1979.  Mother Teresa died in Calcutta in 1997, and the Holy See made her a saint in 2017 (following a process not entirely devoid of controversy). Skopje municipality decided to pay homage to Mother Teresa, and in January 2009, it unveiled the Memorial House of Mother Teresa. This remarkable structure was not built where Mother Teresa was born or lived, but at the location where she was baptized. The design of the house is credited to a well-known architect by the name of Vangel Božinovski, and it is said to have been inspired by Mother Teresa’s birthplace with, understandably, a great deal of artistic liberty. The memorial house consists of an amphitheater in the basement, a museum on the first floor, and a chapel on the top floor. The amphitheater is equipped with multimedia devices and it is used for special events. Among other articles, the museum on the first floor displays handwritten and printed documents signed by Mother Teresa, a number of objects that pinpoint different times of her eventful life, photographs of Mother Teresa with prominent figures, and life-size statues of her likeness. The mortal remains of Mother Teresa are also kept in this location.  The chapel is enclosed by glass panes framed by metal filigree.  It incorporates elements of Macedonian traditional craftsmanship but with a distinctive futuristic flare. The portrait of Mother Teresa dominates the altar. Honorary masses are held to commemorate the life and work of Mother Teresa. This memorial house has been controversial on several accounts. It is hard, for example, to justify spending 2 million Euros to build a memorial to someone who preached poverty all her life. The design of the building is also questionable, as it bears no correlation with the life of Mother Teresa. Finally, there are more basic questions regarding the very existence of a memorial to immortalize Mother Teresa, a figure that is not appreciated universally. It can be argued that her insistence on poverty and suffering has impacted negatively on hospitals following her approach, leading to deficiency in hygiene and parsimonious use of medicines, especially analgesics.",nuns saints memorials

It consists of a concrete monument inspired by an upside-down poppy flower. Half of this structure is indoors, and it houses a series of mosaics and smaller monuments. Underneath the monument is a crypt with the remains of 87 partisans. The credits for the design of this ossuary monument go to Ljubomir Denkoviḱ and Savo Subotin. Its construction began in 1976 and continued for three years, and the monument was eventually unveiled on 11 October 1979. As a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, this structure suffered years of neglect and vandalism. The bronze plaques that adorned the open-air section of the monument were stolen, and graffiti started appearing. Fortunately, the indoor section was not broken into, and the mosaics and the smaller statue survived unscathed. The situation started improving in the 2010s, when funds were allocated to the renovation of the ossuary monument. As of 2022, four of the six original bronze plaques have been recovered and returned to their rightful place.

112,Freedom Monument,"Kočani, North Macedonia",A mosaic monument that commemorates the historical struggles of the people of North Macedonia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/freedom-monument-north-macedonia,"Whenever a monument is dedicated to freedom, this term has to be unpacked.  Without delving too deep into semantics, freedom can personal or collective, and it can be intended as freedom to do something, or freedom from something undesirable.  The Freedom Monument in Kočani refers to the struggle of the local people against outside aggressors, focussing specifically on the tumultuous events that took place during the 20th century. During the early 1970s, the people of Kočani started collecting funds for the construction of a spomenik (monument or memorial).  Following a public contest, a design created by Gligor Čemerski and Radovan Rađenović was selected. Construction began in 1975 and lasted two years, but the official unveiling of the spomenik did not happen until 1981, coinciding with the anniversary of the foundation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Built on top of a hill overlooking the whole of Kočani and beyond, the Freedom Monument consists of several irregular concrete panes forming an amphitheater. It showcases mosaics recalling key historical events underlining the struggle that Macedonians faced in claiming sovereignty and independence. The first event that the Freedom Monument immortalizes is the 1903 Ilinden Uprising against the Ottoman Empire. This is recalled through the image of an insurgent flying high the rebel flag that reads “Freedom or Death” in Cyrillic characters. The most prominent mosaic stands high at the center of the panes, and it depicts the “Lady of Freedom,” a female figure holding red and blue ribbons.  Most panes are placed horizontally, with the exception of two mounted on pillars. The style of the mosaics is abstract, calling to mind the cubist paintings of Pablo Picasso. Since its unveiling, Freedom Monument has been an important point of reference for the people of Kočani. However, the demise of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia translated into years of neglect for the Freedom Monument. As of 2022, visiting the monument felt like visiting an abandoned public space: the tiles of the mosaics were damaged, unsightly graffiti covered sections of the monument, and the concrete panes were crumbling.",public art politics monuments

The fittingly named “Troll’s Tongue” sticks out of a vertical mountainside above a 700 meter (about 2,300 feet) drop. The scenic cliff offers a magnificent view of lake Ringedalsvatnet in Skjeggedal. It was made thousands of years ago by water from a glacier freezing off part of the rock. Keep an eye on your feet as there’s no safety rail here. You can take a funicular up part of the way, though it isn’t always functioning. Otherwise, it is roughly an 8 to 10-hour hike roundtrip through mountains and waterfalls to the ledge. In recent years, this spot has become more popular with travelers looking for that perfect Instagram shot. If waiting in line to take a photo isn’t to your liking, this might no longer be a good destination for you.  You can also get to Skjeggedal by public transport: take bus #995 from Odda.

The curvy road dips and arches over the brutal waves of the Norwegian Sea that often crash over the pavement during storms, and was subjected to 12 hurricanes during construction. A 5.2-mile (8,274-meter long) segment of County Road 64 in Norway, it consists of several causeways, seven bridges, and four viewpoints to take in the scenic views. The road winds over an entire archipelago in the Norwegian Sea, linking the tiny islands and connecting the communes of Eide and Averoy in the county of Møre og Romsdal. Along with the practical reason for the road (to unify Norway) the swooping stretch is also a popular fishing spot; one of the bridges is specifically designed for it. Tourists and locals alike can go cod fishing on the designated side of the highway. In the 20th Century, the route was originally envisioned as a railway, but the plans never managed to materialize. Schematics and planning for a road began developing in the 1970s, but construction didn’t start until August 1, 1983. After being hit by one hurricane after another (for a total of 12!) and costing 122 million Norwegian Krone, the bridge was finally opened on July 7, 1989. Even though it costed a fortune, now the road is toll free. Driving along the Atlantic Road is like teetering on the edge of the sea.

Kjeragbolten is a boulder wedged in a mountain crevasse by the edge of the Kjerag mountain in Lysefjord, near Stavanger. You might have seen it in one of the “Where the Hell is Matt” videos, which feature a man doing a crazy dance in dozens of locations around the world. The boulder itself is a five-cubic-meter large block of stone suspended above 984-meter deep abyss. Despite its impressive appearance, it is easily accessible on foot without any special equipment. The whole of Kjerag mountain is a popular hiking area, and Kjeragbolten is a favorite photo spot. Apparently, for some the thrill of standing on a boulder suspended between two cliffs isn’t quite enough, as Kjeragbolten has become a very popular spot for base jumpers to use when launching themselves into the air. The hike up can be somewhat challenging for non-experienced hikers. It is not appropriate for small children. Good hiking shoes/boots are recommended. Also, bring plenty of water and sunscreen, as there are no trees to shelter under on the mountains.  Take E39 out of Stavanger and head for Ålgård. After passing Ålgård turn left to Sirdalen via Oltedal, Dirdal and Byrkjedal (route 45). At the toll station at Øvstabø turn left for Sinnes, pass Fidjeland and turn left again for Lysebotn.

117,Viking Ship Museum,"Oslo, Norway",Home to three historic ships from the age of Vikings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viking-ship-museum,"In 1903 a farmer named Knut Rom made an extraordinary discovery on his property: a complete ship from the Viking era, along with two skeletons and a treasure trove of grave goods. The ship Rom discovered became known as the Oseberg Ship, and it is the centerpiece of the Viking Museum in Oslo. The Oseberg Ship is 21.5 meter long oak “karv” type ship, a slightly smaller than average, early ship style. The bow and stern are richly decorated with carvings of interlocking beasts. Almost as exciting as the discovery of such a complete and beautiful ship, the grave goods contained some very mysterious items. The so-called “Buddha Bucket” is the most famous mystery. Decorating the base of the handles on this otherwise unremarkable bucket, two small brass figures seated in the Lotus position look like nothing more than tiny, completely out of place, Buddhas. Although it is possible that Vikings did have contact with Asian cultures (and in fact another Buddha figure is on display at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm) researchers consider it more likely a result of coincidental hodge-podge of styles from their many Northern European contacts. In 1904, at the time of the excavation of this remarkable find, there was no room to house it in the existing historical museum. In fact, two other ships, the Tune Ship and the Gokstad Ship, were also in need of a home. The first designs for the Viking Museum were drawn up in 1914, but it was not until 1957 that it finally opened its doors. The Oseberg, Tune, and Gokstad Ships are all now housed inside the museum. All of the ships were built between the years 800 and 900, the height of the Viking Age. The first ship discovered was the Tune Ship in 1867, but it is not in as good condition as the Oseberg or the Gokstad. The Gokstad Ship was discovered in 1880 in a burial mound along with two male skeletons, and is displayed with a reconstructed burial chamber. The Gokstad has also had new life in the form of replicas, one of which successfully crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1893 to be exhibited at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. There is another Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark. Update as of January 2022: The museum is currently closed for renovations. Update as of June 2022: Their website states that they will reopen as the Museum of the Viking Age in 2026.",vikings collections statues

Though this building has stood since around the year 1130, archaeological excavations indicate there were at least three buildings there before the church that stands today. Scholars believe church ground has been a site of Christian worship at least since the early 11th century. The church boasts an artistic style unique to Scandinavia in the 11th and 12th centuries. The so-called “Urnes style” incorporates animal figures into the delicate, winding lines of traditional Viking carving. This is no museum piece though. The church has been in use from the time it was built, with architectural updates along the centuries. It has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The carvings on the church lend insight to the cosmology of medieval Scandinavian Christians, who combined Norse and Christian mythology. The most notable and mysterious carving in the church is on the northern wall. It depicts a snake-like creature being eaten by a four-footed animal.

Sixteen feet below sea level, diners can enjoy local delicacies while watching fish swim on the other side of a panoramic window. It’s not the first time Snøhetta, the architecture firm behind Under, has created something spectacular. They also designed the iconic Oslo Opera House. But constructing a restaurant that could be submerged in the sea posed new challenges. One of the most time-consuming parts of the process was ensuring the building could withstand its harsh ocean environment. The restaurant would need to brave waves, storms, and, of course, constant water pressure. From the outside, Under looks like a container that fell off a truck and slid into the water. But after visitors walk inside and descend the stairs, they’ll enter a whole new world. In addition to the underwater view, there is a fixed seasonal tasting menu that features foods from the surrounding area, including fish, seabirds, wild sheep, and plants such as sea kale and arrowgrass.  Be warned: There is a long waiting list to dine at Under.

This unusually shaped, massive rectangular cliff rises 604m above Lysefjorden. The name Preikestolen translates to Preacher’s Pulpit or Pulpit Rock. It is situated almost at exactly the opposite side of the fjord from another well known natural oddity Kjeragbolten rock, and in close proximity to the city of Stavanger. The top of the cliff is almost a perfect square, 25m by 25m wide, and nearly flat, which makes it a perfect platform for BASE jumping. In ancient times the cliff might have been used in pagan religious ceremonies, perhaps as a place of sacrifice. Preikestolen is also a favorite hiking destination. The hiking trip from the closest parking place takes about two hours. The trail starts at 270 meters above sea level and climbs to 604 meters. The total elevation difference of only 334m is a bit misleading as the path climbs up and descends numerous ridges. Still, it is comfortable hiking experience not requiring any special skills and preparations. With almost 300,000 visitors each year it can become a bit too crowded at times. There is a ferry from Stavanger to Tau and then a bus from Tau to the Preikestolen operated by Tide Reiser. You can get the ferry ticket on the pier and bus once you crossed the lake, but it's highly recommend to book everything in advance. The hike can be done the during the whole year, but it’s advised to do from April to October. The best time is during the summer though.",long now locations geological oddities geology
121,Nigardsbreen Ice Cave,"Luster, Norway",A stunning silver lining to global warming's gloomy cloud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nigardsbreen-ice-cave,"Though the Jostedal glacier had bucked the trend by advancing throughout much of the last decade, the glacier’s winning streak came to an end in 2006 when it began retreating alongside its icy brethren. Soon after, in the autumn of 2007, researchers discovered a spectacularly large, pristine ice cave beneath the Nigardsbreen region of Norway’s Jostedal Glacier National Park. What they found when crawling through the cave’s five-meter opening was so magnificent that one scientist went so far as to beatify the grotto by calling it an “ice cathedral.” Once inside, the cavernous dome measures up to eight meters in height, 30 meters deep and 20 meters wide. Its water and ice formations appear in deep crystalline blues, while the ceiling is punctuated by large icicles. Due to the literally fluid nature of the ice, the cave’s appearance is constantly changing. Experts have attributed its unparalleled formation as an bi-product of glacial melting resulting from a steadily warming climate. Huge amounts of water melting from the glacier continue to erode the its innermost surfaces. The lagoon within the grotto simultaneously accumulates the runoff, while encouraging further melting as it ever-so-slightly warms the air trapped within the cave. Despite its location on one of the most easily accessible glaciers on Earth, the Nigardsbreen grotto is not to be entered by the general public without a guide. This is particularly the case throughout the summer months when warm temperatures and an active melting cycle dramatically increase the likelihood of the cave’s collapse. There are access roads to the park from many of the surrounding valleys, including Jostedalen, Veitastrond, Fjærland, Stardalen, Oldedalen and Lodalen. Exit Rv55 Sognefjellet Road at Gaupne and go north on Rv604. From late June to early September, No 160 (Jostedalsbrebussen) runs between Sogndal and the base of Nigardsbreen glacier. Check schedule for departure and arrival times. A ferry shuttles visitors across the lagoon to the glacier face from mid-June to August. Accommodation can be found at camp sites, guest houses and hotels in the valleys outside the park. Cabins within the park are accessed by foot (a few hours hike) from the main roads.",ice caves glaciers caves natural wonders ecosystems water nature

Although the darkness is correct, the temperatures in the Lofoten Islands of Norway defy convention. Despite their location, the Lofoten Islands, tucked inside the Arctic Circle, rarely dip below freezing. Due to a convergence of the Gulf Stream with two underwater currents, the North Atlantic Current and the Norwegian Current, the weather in Lofoten remains anomalously warm. Two cities in Lofoten, Røst and Værøy, have average temperatures above freezing for the entire year.

123,Vigeland Sculpture Park,"Oslo, Norway","One man's exploration of the human form, including the bizarre and delightful ""Man Attacked by Babies.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vigeland-sculpture-park,"The human form is deeply embedded into the natural pattern-recognition mechanism of our brains. We have an instinctual knowledge of body and face proportions and, as a consequence, human forms remain deeply ingrained in our art and sense of aesthetics. Vigeland Sculpture Park is a result of one man’s artistic obsession and a lifetime of work dedicated to exactly that: the human form. The park contains 212 bronze and granite sculptures created by Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland. He worked over a period of almost 20 years, from 1924 to 1943, and donated his sculptures to the city of Oslo. The sculptures range in topic from representation of humans in everyday situations, such as walking, sitting, holding hands, to more symbolic subjects such as “Man Attacked by Babies,” to highly abstract works, which represent the centerpiece of the complex. Among the highlights of the park are “The Fountain,” which was originally designed to stand in front of the Norwegian Parliament. This location, however, proved controversial. The sculpture consists of 60 individual bronze reliefs representing the circle of life, with sculptures of children, teenagers, old men, and skeletons. “The Monolith” is the focal point of the park. It is a 14.12-meter high, highly symbolic sculpture consisting of 121 intertwined human figures, meant to represent the human desire to reach out to the divine. The carving of this monolith took over 14 years and involved work by the artist himself as well as 3 other stone carvers. In addition, 36 sculptural groups reside on the plateau around the monolith. “The Wheel of Life” is a sundial positioned at the very end of an 850-meter axis. Thematically, it continues the journey-of-life motive prevalent in the rest of the park. It is represents eternity, with four human figures and a baby locked in a circle, floating in harmony. Vigeland continued to work on the park until the end of his life. Since its opening to the public in 1940, the park has become a favorite picnic area for the citizens of Oslo.

124,Fantoft Stave Church,"Bergen, Norway",The burning of this 12th-century church kicked off a campaign of Norwegian Black Metal terror.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fantoft-stave-church,"Located in the Fana borough in Bergen, Norway, is a blackened stave church that is nearly a millennium old. Or it would be nearly that age today if it hadn’t been destroyed (most likely) by Black Metal musician and arsonist, Varg Vikernes, in 1992. The original Fantoft Stave Church was built around 1150 in Fortun, a small village about 183 miles northeast of Bergen. Like other stave churches with their characteristic soaring vertical design, its fully wooden construction was supported only by a foundation made of stones. The structure’s planks, columns, and supports were dovetailed or pegged together—no glue or nails necessary. Hundreds of these peculiarly Norwegian stave churches were built in the 12th and 13th centuries, but by the 19th century there were only a few dozen left.  Though Fantoft Stave Church was one of the lucky few left standing, the hard economic conditions in Norway had left the church in disrepair. Local villagers began to remove salvageable pieces for their farms — including the baptismal font, which was repurposed as a trough for livestock. The structure was slated for demolition until a Bergen businessman, Fredrik Georg Gade, bought it and had it moved piece by piece to Fantoft, where it was reconstructed. Eventually, the church was listed as a historic site. That is, of course, until it was burned to the ground in 1992, the first in a spate of church fires set by Norway’s emerging Black Metal scene that ultimately consumed 22 stave churches. Vikernes, AKA Count Grishnackh, was later convicted of burning four churches, but was found not guilty in the case of the Fantoft Stave Church. Suspicion continued to swirl around Vikernes, however, as he had bragged to a journalist in 1993 that the Fantoft fire was the work of the Black Metal community, rather than lightning or electrical failure (as had initially been believed), and had used a photograph of the burnt church on his 1993 EP release, Aske (Norwegian for ashes), for his one-man band, Burzum. Vikernes stated that the church-burning campaign was part of a war Black Metal was waging on Christianity and Norwegian society. The reconstruction that stands in its place today was completed in 1997 and includes the original crucifix, which survived the fire. While it is no longer a designated historical building, it is a faithful representation of this unique, centuries-old church style built during the overlap of traditional Norse mythology and new-fangled Christianity in Norway. Update as of July 2021: The church is closed for the 2021 summer season.",stave churches fires music churches sacred spaces architecture
125,Flåmsbana (Flåm Railway),"Flåm, Norway","One of the most breathtaking railways in Europe also takes one of the steepest climbs, from fjord to mountain plateau.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flamsbana-flam-railway,"Europe’s steepest non-funicular railway is in southern Norway, covering 10 miles from the high plateau of Myrdal to the tiny fjord-side town of Flåm. The historic Flåm Railway (Flåmsbana in Norwegian) passes through wide valley vistas and alongside dramatic waterfalls, and chugs at a leisurely pace through 20 tunnels, some with “windows” carved in the side so passengers don’t miss a beat. Starting construction in 1924 after decades of planning, it took more than 15 years to complete the short line, including the steepest grade of any European railway that runs on standard gauge track. Funiculars and miniature railways may rise at more of a slant, but the Flåm line’s five and a half percent grade is hard work for a locomotive, and the payoff is some of the most beautiful fjord landscape in Scandinavia. With a grade on this much of a slope, keeping control of the train’s speed is crucial, both going up and coming down. The engine averages around 19 mph (30 km/h) on the downhill trek to Flåm, and tops out at 25 miles an hour (40 km/h) on the way up to Myrdal. You can almost hear the train whispering “I think I can, I think I can…” Flåm is in southern Norway, at the bottom end of Aurlands Fjord. You can get your tickets at the station, or on-line through the Norwegian National Railroad website (https://www.nsb.no/en/frontpage). It can be crowded during cruise ship season, and a seat is not guaranteed (or reserved). You can go round trip or one way (one way is about an hour). A popular alternative is to take the train from Flam to Myrdal and rent bikes to ride back down to Flam on the nearby paved road.",fjords funicular waterfalls tunnels railroads mountains subterranean sites water

At night, the water is illuminated with purple and blue floodlights. Steinsdalsfossen is 50 meters high, is located 2 kilometers east of Norheimsund, and belongs to Fosselva river. It has been a popular destination for generations. For 25 years straight, missing only two seasons, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany made a trip to visit Steinsdalsfossen every summer. He only stopped at the outbreak of World War I. The falls are active almost all year, but are most spectacular when the snow melts in May and June. Its unique location allows for tourists to take a look behind the waterfall as well, there is a small steep path leading up behind the fall. The powers of the water has been an inspiration for many plays and concerts during summer season. In the melting period the waterfall will grow twice as big, and adds to an even more spectacular sight. Feeling a bit hungry? There is a small kiosk with outdoor table and chair right next to the waterfall. Here you can find everything from souvenirs to ice cream.

127,Svalbard Seed Bank,Norway,Cold storage for agricultural biodiversity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/svalbard-seed-bank,"Your grandma is right. The bananas that you can buy today in your local supermarket are not as sweet as the ones that she ate in her childhood. There are many types or “cultivars” of any given fruit – a cultivar is a cultivated plant which is chosen and given a special name because of its desired characteristics – and various types of cultivars (for example in apples, the Red Delicious in the 1870s) come in and out of favor over the years. In the middle of 20th century the dominant banana cultivar exported to North America and Europe was the Gros Michel. However, sometime around 1950, it become virtually extinct due to the rapid spread of the so called “Panama Disease,” a fungal infection that attacks the roots of the banana plant. The Gros Michel was replaced with more resilient but notably less tasty Cavendish cultivar. Modern agriculture is generally focused on maximizing profit by extracting maximal possible yield of crop. A small number of specially selected cultivars of any given crop are planted throughout the world, displacing in the process numerous other local varieties. This approach guarantees consistently high yields under normal conditions but it also harbors a hidden danger. Essentially, every single commercially grown plant is a clone of one of only a few specially selected strains of genetic material. Diversity of genetic material is thus reduced to a bare minimum, leaving crop species exposed to any disease which can exploit that single strain. With corn, wheat, and rice being grown world wide in such a fashion, there is a concern that a newly mutated strain of fungus could wipe out an entire world crop in matter of months, and cause massive food shortages. In order to preserve gene diversity of major food crops, international institutions have established a series of green gene banks, which store samples of genetic material of various strains of each plant species. Svalbard Seed Bank is meant as a sort of safety net, a reserve of last resort and the vault functions like a genetic safety deposit box. It stores duplicate specimens from genebanks worldwide and while the Svalbard seed bank owns the building, the individual depositor owns the contents of his or her box and the access to individual specimens is regulated by their respective depositors. The facility currently has a capacity to conserve 4.5 million seed samples. With approximately 1.5 million distinct seed samples of agricultural crops thought to exist, the Svalbard Seed Bank can store roughly three of each sample. Under the current temperature conditions in the vault (temperatures similar to those in a kitchen freezer) the seed samples can remain viable to begin new crops for anywhere from 2000 to 20,000 years. The seed bank is located in an old copper mine on remote northern island of Spitsbergen, Norway. The main storage is 120m inside a sandstone mountain, on a tectonically dead island. The bank employs a number of robust security and preservation systems. Seeds are packaged in special four-ply packets and heat sealed to exclude moisture. A local coal mine and powerplant supplies the electricity for refrigeration control. The remote northern location also serves as a natural fridge. In the case of complete power failure at least several weeks will elapse before the temperature rises to the ?3 °C of the surrounding sandstone bedrock. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault opened for deposits officially on February 26, 2008 with the construction of the vault financed entirely by Norwegian Government. The operational cost is currently shared by Norway and the Global Crop Diversity Trust.  The Svalbard Seed Bank is situated near the town of Longyearbyen, the biggest settlement on Svalbard.Svalbard Airport Longyear (LYR) is services daily Scandinavian Airlines (SAS Braathens) flights to Tromsø all year around, and there are additional flights as well as twice-weekly services direct to Oslo in the summer high season.

The Battle of Hafrsfjord in 872 is widely regarded as the conflict that finally achieved unity amongst the warring factions of western Norway. In reality, the process of unification likely took hundreds of years, but the popular legend is that it was this one battle that achieved peace. The decisive battle was thought to have taken place between King Harald Fair Hair and two lesser forces. King Harald finally trounced the opposing forces and Norway was brought under his rule. So popular was this battle that there are actually a couple of monuments honoring it. The Sverd i fjell monument certainly seems to be honoring the legend over the reality with its fantastical giants’ swords.

It’s pretty, that’s for sure, but for six months of the year Rjukan is cast into shadow, the rays of the sun lingering temptingly on the mountain sides but never reaching the town. But that all changed when one resident decided to illuminate the town square using three giant mountaintop mirrors. For six months each year, the rays of the sun, blocked by the surrounding mountains, never reach the small town of Rjukan directly. From late September to mid-March, only a gloomy half-light lies over the town during daylight hours. Except, that is, for a strange pool of light on the town square, a spotlight-like circle of sunlight spilling over some 600 square meters and a semi-circle of wooden benches. This is all thanks to the Solspeilet, or sun mirror, a computer-controlled array of three giant mirrors that direct sunlight down from the mountaintop. Located 1,476 feet above the town, the mirrors are programmed to move with the sun, readjusting every 10 seconds to keep a constant beam of light reflecting down upon Rjukan. Installed in 2013, the Solspeilet was the idea of Martin Andersen, an artist who had moved to Rjukan in 2002, but soon found the lack of sunlight depressing. He managed to convince local authorities that this pool of pure sunlight was necessary for the townspeople, an idea that wasn’t actually new. About one hundred years earlier, Sam Eyde, the town’s founder and local leader of industry, also had plans for a sun mirror. Eyde, however, lacked the technology to implement his plan. Instead, he built the Krossobanen, an aerial tramway that could take the residents of Rjukan, most of whom were employees of his Norsk Hydro company, from the town up into the sunlight on the mountains. Thanks to the sun mirror, however, locals no longer need to ride the Krossobanen 2,670 feet up the mountain to get a dose of sunlight, although the cable car system does still function and remains popular. At first, not all residents were convinced that the sun mirrors were worth the money. The investment cost five million NOK at the time (about $778,000), money that many thought could have been better spent. It was nothing more than a gimmick, some argued, a lot of cash for a little slice of sun. But many of these critics soon came around when the mirrors helped put Rjukan on the map. The international attention helped provoke a new wave of tourism, and people still visit Rjukan to stand in the light of the Solspeilet.",weather inventions technology

133,Kon-Tiki Museum,"Oslo, Norway","Across the Pacific in a raft, a museum dedicated to Thor Heyerdahl's now legendary expedition.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kon-tiki-museum,"In 1947 Thor Heyerdahl and a crew of five others sailed 4300 miles, from Peru to the Pacific islands, in a raft they had constructed from balsa wood. Many people thought it was a suicide mission, but on August 7, 1947 after 101 days in the open ocean the Kon-Tiki (the name given to the raft) crashed onto a reef on the Raroia island. The men had successfully rafted 8000 kms or 1/5th of the way around the earths circumference. At the time of the expedition one of great unsolved ethnographic mysteries was how the original inhabitants of Polynesian islands were able to navigate the thousands of miles of open ocean and populate distant scattered islands with stone age technology. One of proposed theories was that the Polynesian people started their migration from South America in pre-Columbian times, and used prevailing westward winds to carry their rafts across the ocean. Heyerdahl intention was to prove this theory was valid by doing it himself. Peru was chosen as a starting point of the expedition. The Kon-Tiki raft was constructed out of balsa wood, bamboo and ropes, using only technology available to people of pre-Columbian America. The crew quickly found that the ocean current pushed them at a steady pace of 1.5 knots and they were able to steer using a system of a lashed outrigger and sideboards that stuck into the water at varying depths. The crew had little trouble with food and though they were provided with MRI’s, flying fish constantly flopped on-board (going so far as to occasionally provide a wet slap in the face to one of the crew as they sailed through the air) and these, along with shark, dolphin, squid and a soup made of plankton constituted their meals. All of which helped prove that there was no technical obstacle for ancient Peruvian people to explore the Pacific. Unfortunately for Heyerdahl, subsequent linguistic and genetic research has proven that the origin of Polynesian peoples lies in Asia and that their migration had an eastward direction. Heyerdahl believed it impossible that the ancient explorers would set sail against the prevailing winds. In reality it was exactly the fact that they could rely on the westward wind to safely return them home in case of unsuccessful expedition, that encouraged these ancient navigators to sail ever more to the east. Proceedings from the documentary movie and the book about his first expedition provided Heyerdahl with the money to fund several more trips including a 1955-1956 expedition to Rapa Nui, a 1969 and 1970 cross-Atlantic expeditions from Morocco to America in reed rafts Ra and Ra II, and a 1978 expedition in reed raft Tigris across Indian ocean. The original Kon-Tiki raft is at the display in the museum.

The 14-foot-wide wooden platform spans 110 horizontal feet from the treetops before dramatically plunging downwards, giving visitors the illusion of falling into the landscape. Thankfully, a thin pane of glass prevents visitors from slipping off the edge, as well as provides them with a breathtaking view while suspended over the mountainside. Due to its abrupt “drop,” the lookout has earned nicknames such as “ski jump” and “diving board.” But offering reassurance, architect Wilhelmsen writes: “It is meant to be scary, but the structure and glass are very safe.”",natural wonders nature architectural oddities architecture

More importantly, the mythical creature is said to brew the best beer in the Nine Worlds. And that’s why they named this microbrewery and pub in Flåm for him. When you go to the center of Flåm, the first thing you may notice is a white, leafless tree. On closer inspection, you’ll see the tree is carved with faces of characters from Norse mythology and ravens. A path leads off from the tree to what looks like a large stave-church. This is the Ægir brewery. Inside the big, red double-doors is a spacious room with a bar at the back, where you can order beer, aquavit, or mead from the barkeep, who will pour the drinks from taps with antlers for levers. You can then enjoy your drink around a large fireplace at the tables and chairs made from driftwood, or on stone benches covered with sheepskin, while Nordic folk music plays in the background.

That is because many visitors do not take the time to explore the natural wonders it has to offer, such as the Red Beach at Mjelle, which is said to take its color from jewel dust. About a 15-minute drive out of the city, Mjelle Beach is a popular swimming spot in the summer, but its colors are what make it a real attraction. The beach is made up of both red and white sand, so the hues along the shore vary depending on how recent winds and tides have changed the ratio of the grains. The red sands seem to be heavier, so it’s likely that they will be more exposed after a strong storm. On some days, the beach becomes such a deep red that it is almost purple. While there is no clear explanation for the vibrant coloration, the locals say that the sand gets its color from garnet particles. It could be a number of minerals that give the beach its iconic character, but regardless of the true culprit, it is nice to think of an entire beach laced with vaporized gemstones.

Indeed, the trees that will be used to make the printing paper have already been planted. These saplings were planted for the Future Library, a forward-looking art project that’s one part literary time capsule, one part environmental statement. The project, launched in 2014, plans to commission one book from a different author each year for 100 years, none of which will be published until 2114. The stories will be printed on paper made from the 1,000 trees planted in Nordmarka, a forest just north of Oslo. Until then, the manuscripts will be kept on the top floor of the Deichman Library in Oslo, in a space called the “Silent Room.” They will be on display but not made available to read for generations to come, meaning most of us won’t ever get the chance. The Silent Room, set to open in 2019, will be made from the wood that was cleared from the Nordmarka forest to make room for the new trees. The room will only be big enough for a few visitors at a time, and will offer a view of the growing forest off in the distance. Scottish artist Katie Paterson, who conceived of the Future Library project, often uses time and nature for her art. Past projects include mapping dead stars, sending a meteorite back into space, and live broadcasting sounds made by a melting glacier. Paterson knows she will probably not see the finished product of her century-long project, however she plans to attend the Handover Ceremony as long as she can. At the ceremony, held each spring, the author selected for that year’s text holds a reading in the future forest before delivering the manuscript. The first author to participate was, perhaps fittingly, the popular dystopian fiction author Margaret Atwood. Her 2014 novel, Scribbler Moon, has never been read.

(There are a few research bases further north.) The former coal mining town is now the cultural and commercial center of the Svalbard Islands, featuring the northernmost ATM, church, museum, radio station, airport, and university in the world. Due to the town’s precarious latitude—at 78 degrees North—there are a few strange practices that all people living in Longyearbyen must abide by. The most bizarre may be that it is illegal to be buried here. The permafrost and sub-zero temperatures in Longyearbyen make it so that any dead bodies lying six feet under are perfectly preserved, as if mummified. Therefore, the government of Svalbard requires that any dead bodies must be flown by plane or shipped by boat to mainland Norway for burial. This law has been in effect since 1950. The freezing temperature also requires that all houses must be built on stilts, so that when the island’s layer of topsoil melts in the summer houses don’t sink and slide away. Cats are banned from the city, in order to protect endangered Arctic birds. And due to the impending threat of polar bear attacks in the frigid Arctic Circle, residents are encouraged by the government to carry a firearm for protection when traveling outside the settlement (loaded firearms within the town are prohibited however). Every year, on March 8 at 12:15 p.m., the people of Longyearbyen celebrate “Solfestuka,” a holiday honoring the town’s first glimpse of the sun in over four months. With a complete absence of the sun for a third of every year, it’s always certain to be a long year in Longyearbyen.",arctic circle snow ice burial places

You are still in Norway, but standing at the gateway to the Arctic. North Cape, or Nordkapp, is on the northernmost Norwegian island of Magerøya. The dramatic landscape, with giant cliffs jutting straight up out of the frigid waters, fits perfectly when you consider North Cape’s home at the handshake of two seas (the Barents and the Norwegian), and the bumping of two oceans (the North Atlantic and the Arctic). For hundreds of years, travelers scaled or sailed around these rocky cliffs, some looking for the Northeast Passage, like English explorers Richard Chancellor and Steven Borough, who coined the name North Cape in 1553. Others were looking for knowledge or solace, or both like Franciscan priest Francesco Negri, who made it there in 1664 and is widely considered to be its first “tourist.” And still others were simply showing off their power and wealth—Emperor Wilhelm of Germany, King Louis XVIII of France, King Oscar of Norway and Sweden, and even King Rama of then-Siam all made pilgrimages to the end of Europe. The trip was rough and usually required both perseverance or money. You no longer need to have the wealth of monarchs or the stoicism of a Franciscan monk to make it there. Modern roads and transportation have made it much easier than trying to find the Northwest Passage. Once there, the clifftop Globe Monument has become the meeting place of travelers who still want to see the jumping-off point of Europe into the Arctic (please don’t jump—the water is very cold).

Throughout the 1900s, everyone had their hands in Pyramiden at one point or another… until suddenly no one did. Founded by Swedes on a Norwegian island chain in the Arctic Ocean in 1910, the terrain was sold to the Soviet Union in 1927. For the next 70 years, a hearty band of Soviets mined the remote settlement on behalf of Trust Arktikugol for its coal deposits, until word was passed down in 1998 that the operation was to be shuttered. Then, in a matter of mere months, the place was unceremoniously abandoned. In the years since, little has changed in the former Soviet mining camp except for the demographics of Pyramiden’s residents. At present the island inhabited solely by wildlife, including seabirds, seals, the occasional polar bear, and roaming bands of explorers. The village is home to the ghostly remains of a lost Soviet industrial way of life, literally frozen in time. According to an episode of the television series Life After People, it is estimated that Pyramiden will stand as it is for 500 years or more thanks to the extreme arctic climate  – longer than any other modern human settlement on Earth. Block settlements continue to be lorded over by the world’s northernmost statue of Vladimir Lenin, whose lonesome gaze remains fixed upon the Nordenskiöld glacier butting up against the town’s backyard. The most ethereal feature of the town is undoubtedly the so-called “bottle shop,” a house made entirely from white and green glass bottles, whose beauty, delicacy, and impracticality in the face of such harsh climates seem downright otherworldly. Arriving by ship, visitors to the eerie settlement tromp through the remnants of Soviet culture, led by a gun-toting guide who will not hesitate to shoot in case of a bear attack. Most choose to explore for a few hours before being shuttled back to civilization, but those interested in staying overnight in a post-apocalyptic arctic landscape can arrange to do so ahead of time at the Tulip Hotel and Museum (open during the summer months).

Known as the Lærdal Tunnel (or Lærdalstunnelen in Norwegian), the tunnel’s construction lasted five years and was completed in 2000, surpassing the world’s second longest tunnel, the St. Gottard Tunnel in Switzerland, by five miles. Aside from its length, the Lærdal Tunnel is also the first to feature its own air treatment plant. Located in a 328-foot (100 m) cavern, the plant is comprised of two large fans and an electrostatic and carbon filter, which all work to remove dust and nitrogen dioxide from the large structure. Since it takes the average driver 20 minutes to travel through the tunnel, special design features were added in order to prevent drivers from falling asleep. The tunnel is thus divided into four different sections that are broken up by “mountain caves.” The mountain caves are 3.7 miles (6 km) apart and each one is equipped with special lighting that gives off the illusion of driving into daylight. In the mountain caves visitors can stop to rest, make a U-turn, or even have a wedding ceremony, as one couple has done.",inventions tunnels subterranean sites architectural oddities architecture
142,Tromsø Arctic Reindeer Experience,"Tønsvik, Norway","At this Arctic outpost, get to know members of the indigenous Sámi community and meet their herds.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tromso-arctic-reindeer-experience,"Believe it or not, reindeer are real—and at the Tromsø Arctic Reindeer Experience, they will nibble on your fingers to prove it. About 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of the Arctic city of Tromsø, Norway, lies a sprawling camp that’s home to about 300 reindeer. Open to the public since 2016, the reindeer camp occupies a truly surreal environment. Mountains rise up above pale blue fjords on one side, while vast expanses of tundra extend outward on the other. Weather moves quickly across the Arctic environment, and a clear day can soon become a blizzard. When the astronomical conditions are just right, the Northern Lights have been known to dance across the snow, scintillating visitors. Founded by the indigenous reindeer herder Johan Isak Turi Oskal, the camp—a few small wooden buildings, a tent called a lavvu, and a pen for the reindeer—was initially a way to protect the animals from the perils of climate change. Across the Arctic, from Norway to Canada, wild reindeer populations have been wiped out by warmer temperatures, which make it harder for them to dig for food and an easier target for predators. Enclosed in Oskal’s camp, the reindeer, despite still being wild animals, nonetheless require a lot of maintenance. Every morning and every evening, Oskal and the other indigenous herders who work there must lasso them one-by-one. Throughout the day, they keep an eye on the herd, scanning the landscape for predators. Reindeer, visitors will quickly find out, are a rather single-minded bunch. Food is their main priority, and they are not afraid to jostle their companions out of the way to stick their noses into your blue bucket or, alternatively, the camp’s feeding trough. Theirs is a simple existence, but also a threatened one: making the role of the Sámi herders in their preservation and the preservation of the natural ecosystem that sustains them perhaps more important than ever.  To get to the Tromsø Arctic Reindeer Experience, you will first have to choose a tour online. Visits to the camp run from mid-November to early-April. In winter, snow boots and suits are recommended, though you can always warm up near the fire.

The museum portions of the aquarium feature displays on the Svalbard region as well as simulated permafrost, while the aquarium proper contains rare specimens of cold water fish and other arctic marine life from the area. The main attraction is a large pool that houses a number of large bearded seals that visitors can get remarkably close to thanks to viewing bubbles in the tank wall. Maybe the most remarkable aspect of the aquarium is the building itself. It was designed to evoke massive ice flows that have pushed up against one another, breaking and stacking into a slanted fringe.

146,Fram Museum,"Oslo, Norway",Housing the famous Norwegian ice-defying 19th century polar exploration ship.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fram-musum,"No other ship better symbolizes the age of polar exploration than the Fram. Built originally for Fridtjof Nansen, and reputed to be the strongest wooden ship ever built, it served in expeditions by no less then four polar explorers, Nansen himself, Otto Sverdrup, Oscar Wisting, and Roald Amundsen. By the last decades of the 19th century, men had explored most of the planet. Earth’s polar regions remained one of few blank spots on the map, the last remaining targets for explorers and sportsmen. the competition to be first to the Poles was ferocious. To to sail further north then anyone, Nansen required a ship especially adapted for the harsh conditions in the Arctic. The biggest danger to the ships in the age sailing in the northern ocean was to be trapped by ice during the winter freeze. Expanding ice would exert ever-increasing pressure on the hull of the ship, eventually crushing it completely. Nansen envisioned a ship that could ‘float’ over the packed ice. The shape of the Fram’s hull was designed in such a way that it would slowly deflect the expanding ice. Ice would slide down below the ship’s body and slowly lift it unharmed. Furthermore, the rudder and propeller were designed to be retracted into the ship, to protect them from damage. The Fram could pack enough supplies to sustain its crew for at least five years. Its hull was heavily insulated to ensure protection from the cold. The ship even included a windmill, which ran a generator to provide electric power for lighting by electric arc lamps. Commissioned in 1890, the main designer of the new ship was Colin Archer, a Norwegian shipbuilder of Scottish descent. The ship was given the appropriate name Fram, meaning “Forward” in Norwegian. For its first polar outing, in 1893 Nansen launched a three year expedition attempting to reach the North Pole. The idea was to intentionally get the ship trapped in the ice and then float, carried by ocean currents, over the Pole. This expedition ended unsuccessfully in 1896. Nansen later went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922 for his humanitarian projects. Later, the Fram was used by Otto Sverdrup during his exploration of Canadian arctic between 1898 and 1902. But perhaps the most famous expedition in which this vessel played a part was the ill-fated race to the South Pole between Roald Amundsen and British explorer Robert Falcon Scott, in 1910-1912. Amundsen gained world fame for winning the race to the Pole; Scott’s entire party died of exposure and starvation en route back, having reached the prize second. This was the Fram’s last big voyage. The famous ship remained anchored until 1935 when the Museum was built. The ship is the primary attraction at the museum, which also offers a good selection of material about the Fram’s voyages and the history of Norwegian polar explorations. On display are maps, personal notes of explorers and variety of objects used in everyday life aboard this vessel. Visitors can climb aboard and explore the insides of the ship, as well. To get to the Fram museum you can travel by bus (30 Bygdøy) to the stop Bygdøynes, or by boat båt (91 Bygdøy) from Rådhusbrygge 3 (Oslo City Hall, pier 3) to the stop Bygdøynes.",polar week dead explorers natural history collections

Depending on the angle (and the viewer’s imagination), the mushroom rock may take the shape of a goblet, a leafy stem, a wonky heart, a statue of a mushroom cloud, or a lopsided whale tale bursting through the surrounding stones. Locals used to call the misshapen geological figure “kannestolen” because it supposedly also resembles a one-legged chair (“stolen” is the Norwegian word for chair).

148,Saltstraumen Maelstrom,"Bodo, Norway",World's strongest whirlpool.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saltstraumen-maelstrom,"A maelstrom (or malström/malstrøm in the Scandinavian languages) is a very powerful whirlpool. The Nordic word was introduced into English by Edgar Allan Poe in his story “A Descent into the Maelström”  in 1841. In turn, the Nordic word may have been borrowed from the Dutch maelstrom (modern spelling maalstroom, meaning literally ‘crushing current’) and malström in Swedish is the combination of mala, to grind, and ström, meaning current. One can find just such a maelstrom in Saltstraumen sound in Norway. Located in Nordland, 30 km east of the city of Bodø, Norway in a narrow channel – connecting the outer Saltfjord with the large Skjerstadfjord – is the strongest tidal current in the world. Up to 400 million m³ (tonnes) of seawater force their way through a three kilometer long and only 150-meter wide strait every six hours, with water speeds reaching 37 kilometers per hour. Vortices up to ten meters in diameter and five meters deep at the eye of the vortex are formed when the current is at its strongest. Saltstraumen has existed for over two thousand years. Before that, the area was different due to the pressure from the glaciers that had covered Norway for tens of thousands of years. The current is created when the tide tries to fill the Skjerstad fjord. The height difference between the sea level and the fjord inside can be up to one meter and the speed of the current trying to even out that difference can be up to 40 km per hour or 25 miles per hour. When the current turns, there is a period when the sound is navigable. During these times the current is almost calm and one would never suspect it to be the site of one of the world’s greatest maelstroms. It’s possible to check the tide times on the local websites in order to plan well. There are a few ways to experience Saltstraumen Maelstrom—looking at the whirlpools from the Saltstraumen Bridge, take a boat tour along the strait when waters are calm, and snorkel in the Saltstraumen strait with all the necessary equipment.

The farm had burned down and was subsequently abandoned in the middle of the 6th century, near the end of the Migration Period. With the decline of the Roman Empire, tribes of people began scattering throughout the European continent, often establishing farms in former Roman territory. Jernaldergården, a restored Iron Age farm in Stavanger, shows what farm life would have been like during this period—even before the Viking age. The farm was reconstructed on the remains of the original farm, based on the findings of archeological excavations in the 1960s. It consists of three stone and turf longhouses built partially underground and large fields of open land where the farm keeps a flock of Old Norwegian sheep. University students, dressed in Iron Age clothing, show visitors around the farm and the longhouses, explaining and demonstrating what daily life would look like for a farmer from the 500s.

It was later rebuilt under Bishop Arne, and the Romanesque Cathedral was enlarged in the Gothic style, providing a fascinating intersection of architectural eras for those who know where to look and how.

Originally the tobogganing track that now sits on a often-snowy hill in Oslo was a roadway that provided access to the neighborhood of Frognerseterveien. However seeing an opportunity in the sloped curves of the road, a local entrepreneur capitalized on the growing popularity of tobogganing in the late 1800s. He began creating sledding tracks, which were later expanded and taken under the wing of the local government who saw that they could be a real tourist draw to the area. At first there was heated competition between which winter sport would have control over the track between tobogganing and cross-country skiing, with the former finally winning central authority over the venue. The hill was altered once again during the 1952 Olympics when it was converted to accommodate a temporary bobsledding track. Due to a general lack of interest in the sport in the area, the organizers simply built the new track with snow, hard-packed and frozen.  While it would thaw and melt each year while training went on, it would simply be rebuilt the next. After the Olympics, the focus of the Korketrekkeren returned its beloved toboggans which continue to dominate the track to this day.

Situated 20 kilometers outside the nearest town of Alta, alongside a river of the same name, the Igloo Hotel at Sorrisniva holds the title of “world’s northernmost ice hotel.” Constructed in a t-shape, the hotel consists of 30 rooms, a restaurant, and an ice bar. Everything about the place, from its walls to the interior — even down to its bed frames and the glasses in its bar — are constructed from pure, frozen Scandinavian water. In addition to the more de rigueur hotel features, Sorrisniva’s slick incarnation is adorned with ice sculptures at every turn. There’s even an ice chapel where it’s possible to kneel in prostration to the wintery gods without whom this ephemeral world would be impossible. Lest visitors think staying at such a preternaturally frigid hotel would cause them to literally freeze to death, rest assured traditional modes of warmth are provided. Reindeer hides cover the mattresses laid over frozen furniture, and sleeping bags add an extra (albeit more modern) element of toasty comfort. Though it’s advised to sleep in wool long underwear, history is also on one’s side, given the proliferation of cultures who continue to live in ice shelters all winter long – only, perhaps, less luxuriously so. If that’s still not enough to persuade the faint of heart that overnighting in such an environment is a good idea, take solace in the fact that no proper Scandinavian experience would be complete without a wintertime sauna. As you roast inside its steamy confines, try not to be too sad that the Igloo Hotel did not figure out a way to make theirs out of ice.  20 km from Alta city center.

This striking sculpture evokes the power of ice and water ever-present in the high north. The floating stainless steel and glass sculpture named She Lies was designed and created by Italian artist Monica Bonvicini. It is based on Caspar David Friedrich’s painting Das Eismeer (The Sea of Ice). The artwork floats on a concrete platform tethered to the harbor floor, allowing it to turn and change based on the tides and currents. Its subtle movements are a reminder of nature’s constant change. According Public Art Norway (KORO), which supported the installation, the name She Lies adds intentional ambiguity that encourages further reflection. The sculpture is permanently installed in Oslo’s Bjørvika harbor area near the Oslo Opera House.  It's best viewed from the roof of the Oslo Opera House.",public art sculptures art
156,Svalbard Bryggeri,"Longyearbyen, Norway","The world's northernmost brewery uses water from a 2,000-year-old glacier to create its beer.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/svalbard-bryggeri,"Step into what looks like a giant industrial garage, and you’re in for an unexpected treat: the world’s northernmost brewery. You certainly won’t have to worry about being served any lukewarm beers here, as it’s located only 817 miles from the North Pole in an icy tundra with more polar bears than people. Not only is Svalbard Brewery amazing for its geographic placement, but it’s also noteworthy because it’s the result of a long campaign to change Norwegian legislation. In 1928, a law was enacted to prohibit the production of alcoholic beverages within the isolated Arctic archipelago. It served an important purpose: Svalbard was at the time a male-dominated mining society, and the law was a measure to decrease the drunkenness. The goal of the legislation was simply to prevent everyone from brewing alcohol at home. But times have changed, and the mining industry no longer dominates Svalbard as it once did, which all the abandoned mines bear witness to. Tourism and research are just as important to the economy today. Robert Johansen, a former coal miner on Svalbard, came up with the idea of opening the first brewery on the island after spending decades working within and falling in love with the Arctic landscape. Still, when the authorities got his application for a brewing license in 2009, they turned it down because of the law. Instead, a long process to influence the politicians to change it was started. And finally, on July 1, 2014, a new law was passed opening up the possibility to brew beer on Svalbard. Svalbard Brewery soon opened, and the business has grown rapidly ever since. It produces five different beers, and 16 percent of the water used to brew the beverages is collected from thawed ice from a 2,000-year-old glacier. Today the beer is exported both to mainland Norway and abroad, so you can sample some without having to trek to the top of the world.  Tours are held in the brewery.

Torghatten is an imposing mound of granite that rises up out of the surrounding Nordlands like its own island. It would make for a lovely, if an uninteresting geological feature in itself, but it is the natural tunnel that runs straight through it that really makes it something special. The short shaft looks like it was drilled or blown through the rock, but the tunnel is actually a naturally occurring phenomenon. Or if the legend is to be believed, a supernaturally occurring phenomenon. As the local myth surrounding the cave hole goes, it was created out of a troll’s hat. An amorous troll was chasing a woman and she was getting away. Rather than let her live free, the troll tried to shoot her with an arrow, but the troll king threw his hat in the arrow’s path to block it. The arrow left a hole in the hat, and then the hat turned into the mountain now known as Torghatten. Sometimes, myths are just plain weird. Visitors to Torghatten can follow a path up the base of the mountain and pass through the incredible tunnel. It may be one of the only places in the world where anyone can waltz straight through a solid mountain.",trolls tunnels mountains legends subterranean sites geology

Still it is impossible to miss the giant, shining silver elk statue on the side of the road. Storelgen, meaning “the Big Elk,” stands just over 32 feet tall (10 meters). This majestic moose statue temporarily beat out its rival statue - Mac The Moose, in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewn, Canada. Mac The Moose received a new set of antlers, reclaiming his title as “the world’s biggest moose”. The giant statue was created as a rest stop for weary drivers, to break up the monotony for those traveling the road between Oslo and Trondheim. It marks the halfway point between the capital city and Trondheim in the north. It also doubles as a not-so-subtle reminder for drivers to watch out for local wildlife, elk included. The statue was made by Norwegian artist Linda Bakke, in collaboration with the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. It is made of a reflective steel that mirrors its beautiful surroundings.  The statue is located at the Bjøråa picnic area and rest stop off of Route 3, in the village of Atna in the Stor-Elvdal municipality.

It was also where Gerhard Armauer Hansen discovered the leprosy bacteria that causes leprosy, or as the disease is known more commonly today, Hansen’s disease. St. Georges is Norway’s oldest foundation and one of Scandinavia’s oldest hospital institutions and had served as a Norwegian leper colony since the middle ages. From the 1850s through the 1900s the beautiful city of Bergen, Norway had three separate leper houses, and was internationally known as a place where lepers would be received and cared for and was the largest concentration of lepers in all of Europe. Gerhard Armauer Hansen was born in Bergen in 1841 and so would have grown up with lepers a fairly common sight. After earning his medical degree in London Hanson returned to his hometown where he took up studying leprosy. Hanson went on to discover Mycobacterium leprae and show that it was related to the disease in 1873, though it wasn’t until 1880 that scientist Albert Neisser showed it to be the definite etiological agent. Hanson though today celebrated for his discovery was disgraced in his own time for a very serious breach of medical ethics. Hanson attempted to infect at least one woman with the disease without her consent, although he was not successful. Hanson was taken to court and lost his position at the hospital. Today the buildings of the museum are dark and winding demonstrating the cramped living quarters of the lepers. Numerous descriptions and sketches of the lepers symptoms adorn the walls, as well as the early and frightening looking instruments used to treat them. Leper colony, leper museum and the city in which the cause of the disease was first identified, Lepramuseet covers the history of leprosy in as much detail, and perhaps more detail, then one could ever ask for.

One such place is Halvikhallen or Halvikhula (Hall of Halvik or Halvik Cave), known as Northern Europe’s largest cave. The height of this enormous hole carved into the shore mountain by the raging sea is well over 300 feet (100 meters), and about 260 feet (80 meters) wide. One old geological source, a book by Amund Helland called Norges Land og Folk, which was written between 1885 to 1921 in 20 volumes, claims that the cave’s depth is well over 1,000 feet. Very little else is known about the cave due to its remoteness and the arduous trek to access its wonders. Getting to the cave requires a boat or canoe to reach the bay by the Fårøya Island. There, visitors can still see the remains of the old pier. Once on land, it’s impossible to miss the cave due to its enormous size. Approaching the cave can be difficult because of the crumbled rocks near the entrance, but a visit is well worth the effort.

The settlement oozes with historical charm. It’s also home to a most peculiar resident: a cat who has spent years masquerading as a fox. Cats are banned on Svalbard as a measure to protect the island’s wildlife. But Kesha, a fluffy orange cat, is allowed to prowl the city. To bypass the 1990s cat ban, the Russians who brought Kesha to the island registered her as a fox. Of course, there’s more to see in Barentsburg besides its sly “fox.” One of Svalbard’s few remaining operating mines, the settlement’s population seasonally ranges between 400 and 500 people, primarily consisting of Ukranian and Russian miners specializing in the particular challenges posed by the Arctic. While the focus of the state-owned mining company, Trust Arctickugol—which owns and employs almost the entire town—has always been its mining operation, they have shifted in recent years to support more tourism. Today, there are plenty of activities and history packed into the small, remote town. While visiting, you can learn about its near-destruction in World War II, tour the mines, and if you time it right, attend a sporting event or concert.

IceMusic is the invention of Terje Isungset, a Norwegian who has been carving and playing his own ice instruments for many years. Besides being one of the foremost musicians in the field, he created the IceMusic Festival, a celebration of music and winter held inside a hollowed-out ice cave in Geilo, Norway. As the festival has grown, a number of other musicians have begun to innovate in the field. The festival now features the sounds of harps, guitars and horns, all constructed out of ice blocks using chainsaws. The process generally begins with 600-pound ice blocks, that are cut from a frozen lake near Geilo. The artists try to search for ice without impurities such as dirt or bubbles which they have found gives IceMusic a better sound. Focusing on reconnecting to nature, the IceMusic Festival is billed as an extremely pure environmental art form that uses a resource that is abundant in Norway.

It leads out of Stavern, up a steep hill, through some woods, and finally onto a magnificent hill overlooking the coastline. Standing there, you might wonder what lies on the other side of that faraway horizon. In this particular case, you can actually find out, and in great detail. At the very edge of the cliff is a giant stone compass with a movable needle. The flat end of the compass needle has a large square hole in the middle, through which the user can see the inscriptions on the slab. By shifting the needle so the inscription “Amsterdam” is in the square, for example, the compass will point you toward that city as the seagull flies. Corresponding information about longitude and distance is also engraved on the slab. In addition to far-off cities, the compass points to the four lighthouses that can be seen from the hill, and a fifth that you might only spot at night, as a flare of light on the horizon. The compass is made from larvikite, a rare stone only found in two places in the world, this region of Norway (the Larvik fjord) being one of them. Locals take a particular pride in the larvikite stone because the stone is named after the area; most local monuments, statues, and even some buildings are made from it. Add the local community’s strong cultural, industrial, and sentimental links to the ocean, and you can see how this coastal monument in many ways encompasses the very essence of the area. Walk past the Memory Hall (a large, black, pyramid building on the hillside you can't miss), up the hill and then down onto the beach. Follow the coast until you reach a camping area, then walk through it until you start seeing blue dots and lines on trees. Follow these onto the trail, then walk towards Rakke Vest. When you reach a steep climb in the forest, the compass is on the top of said climb. The compass isn't immediately visible, so you might have to look around a bit before you find it.",cliffs maps

Sometimes called “will-o-the-wisps,” eerie orbs like these have been observed the world over. However, the Hessdalen lights are unique - they are being scientifically monitored. Since 1998, the Hessadeln AMS (Automatic Measurement System) has monitored the lights with a magnetometer, two black-and-white cameras, and one color camera. Since its inauguration, the station has recorded many pictures and even videos of the inexplicable luminous orbs. The project is funded in part by a team of Italian chemists. Though many UFO-enthusiasts are following the recordings of the Hessdalen AMS, the goals of the project are not, in fact, extraterrestrial observation but simple scientific curiosity. From the official site: “Knowledge of the Hessdalen phenomenon may give us a better understanding of our world… Better knowledge of our world will give us a better understanding of the consequences of our treatment of the natural environment.” Though the frequency of their appearances varies, on average the Hessdalen lights are observed roughly 20 times a year.",will-o-wisps and spooklights optical oddities strange science

It’s a dramatic show of the power that both created and destroyed these two abandoned plants. Norway began toying with the idea of harnessing wave power in the 1980s. The wind-whipped waters of the North Sea frequently unleash their fury along the west coast, making the country ideally situated to experiment with pioneering wave technology. In 1985, a pilot wave power plant opened at Toftestallen. Waves went crashing into a tapered channel, where the water then coursed through a basin before passing through a turbine generator as the current tugged it back to sea. However, just three years after it opened, a winter storm sent the water hurtling toward the station with a frenzied ferocity. The power plant was destroyed, reduced to ruins by the very same power it aimed to harness. A second wave power plant was built nearby, but it too eventually succumbed to the ocean’s strength. Now, it’s possible to see all that remains of the abandoned plants. The insides of some of the structures are now in disarray and covered with graffiti, and the waves still thrash against them like a constant reminder of nature’s unyielding power.

Such “mols” or cairns as they are more commonly known, were often used by ancient peoples to mark a burial site. Mølen, Norway’s largest stone beach, takes its name from the 230 “mols” or cairns built on it over the ages. The rock piles, which have changed little over the 2000 years they were built, form a sort of ancient cemetery on this beautiful Norwegian beach. The area has 16 large cairns, some exceeding 100 feet in diameter, with almost 200 small cairns in rows parallel to the shoreline. Excavations of the man-made rock piles have revealed burnt stones and iron nails, and been dated to approximately 250 A.D. The piles very well may have served as both burial site and crematorium with the bodies of warriors and sailors burned within. Though archeologists do not know what ceremonies were linked to the burials, it is thought that the most powerful members of society were given the most impressive grave sites, while ordinary people had to make do with simpler types of graves. The cairns, which are clearly visible to passing ships, not only served as burial sites but probably as “sea markers” as well helping ships to navigate between trading centers.

The church, which is the home base for the country’s largest Roman Catholic parish, is named after the city’s guardian saint. Unlike most churches, where the highest point of the interior rises above the building’s center, St. Hallvard’s ceiling swoops downward to create an inverted dome above its central sacred space. According to the church, the downward-facing dome symbolizes God bending toward his creation, rather than reaching toward the Heavens. From the outside, the building itself looks rather more mundane. It appears as a blend of burnt brick and concrete, with sharp edges and few windows on three of its sides. Designed by the famous Norwegian architects Lund & Slaatto, the building, which was completed in 1966, follows the Brutalist architectural style that was popular in Europe at the time. St. Hallvard’s is on the site where the last of the wooden buildings of the Enerhaugen neighborhood’s working-class quarters used to be. The wooden houses were moved to the Norwegian Folk Museum (Norsk Folkemuseum) on Bygdøy. The church is hidden in the midst of the five large residential high-rises on Enerhaugen hill, and hence not very frequently visited.

Tinged yellowish orange by time, it stands out among the green hillsides and brilliantly blue water. It’s nearly all that remains above water of the Z2 Georg Thiele, a German Type 1934-class destroyer. Built in 1934, the ill-fated vessel was only active for six short years before it was run aground during World War II. The destroyer met its demise during one of the Battles of Narvik, which were part of the Norwegian Campaign. It, along with other German defense vessels, squared off against the Allied Forces that attempted to overtake the fjord and nearby city. At the start of the battle, the Z2 Georg Thiele managed to do some damage to the incoming fleet. However, it was later hit by heavy Allied fire. This subsequently caused actual fires to flare up within the ship. The damage was so bad the captain purposely ran it aground so the crew could escape to land. The vessel later snapped in two and capsized. Now, the wreck is a superb diving site for any military history buffs. Though its hull pokes above the surface, the rest of the ship lies drowned below (apart from its bell, which is displayed in a nearby museum). The fjord is a treasure trove of submerged and sunken war relics, thanks to the many battles that took place within its waters. Update August 2018: As of at least July 31st, access to the wreck is blocked by construction on a nearby electrical substation. Nonetheless, you can still get fairly close to the wreck. Update September 2018: Construction work on the nearby electrical substation still continues. As they are putting the wires at the moment access to the ship is totally blocked and there is no other parking possibility left than at the plot with boathouses from where the ship is invisible. With a good telelens, you can take a picture from the road at about half a mile from the ship itself. From the parking area you have to walk about 30 minutes to the final location. Be careful: Parts of the walk are muddy, slippery, and over rocks. The path is also rather hidden, so make sure to look behind the green building for its starting point.",shipwrecks ships lakes war history world war ii water military
175,Neseblod Records,"Oslo, Norway",This record shop and unofficial black metal museum is an ode to Oslo's heaviest musical export.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/helvete-neseblod-records,"This unassuming storefront should be a top priority for any metal fan visiting Oslo. A record shop and unofficial metal museum in Norway’s capitol city, Neseblod Records (“nosebleed”) is also central in many regards to the early history of black metal. The record shop, originally named Helvete, was first opened in June 1991 by the late and now-infamous guitarist Euronymous. The term helvete is Norwegian for “hell,” and comes from the Norse hels víti, translating to “hell’s punishment.” As co-founder and guitarist for the early Norwegian black metal band Mayhem, Euronymous was a central figure in the nascent music scene. He was the only constant member from the band’s formation in 1984 until his death in 1993. The basement of this early record store was a gathering spot for many of Euronymous’ friends and bandmates, making the space something of a mecca for black metal enthusiasts. Today, owner Kenneth “Neseblod” has gathered through Euronymous’ contemporaries enough objects connected to black metal’s early years to constitute a sort of makeshift museum in the basement. The tight upstairs space is packed wall to wall with vinyl records, cassette tapes, CDs, t-shirts, flags, and other sundry black metal paraphernalia.",venues rock and roll music history underground music

It is located next to the Randselva river, and to cross it you have to enter the Twist, a large gallery that serves as a bridge as well as a piece of sculptural architecture. The art park had 25 sculptures on its grounds when it first opened in 1996. The museum spans 43 acres on the grounds of a wood pulp mill that was originally built in the late 19th century. Production at the mill ended in the 1950s, but the buildings remained. Today, the mill and other old factory buildings have been made part of the museum. The Kistefos Museum has grown and changed over the decades that it has been open. The number of sculptures in the park has nearly doubled, and new structures have been built. The Twist, which opened to the public in 2019, spans the river and features views of some of the most beautiful parts of the park: the river, the forest, and old pulp mill that has been turned into one of the museum’s galleries. Kistefos is fit for a day with the family, it has lots of interactive artworks and a playground. The park itself is beautiful and you can take a walk in Norwegian nature and enjoy modern design and art.

Offering an ecclectic variety of visitor experiences ranging from witnessing the majesty of the aurora borealis to a selfie opportunity with an enormous wooden troll, the Arctic Circle Centre has marked the gateway to the land of the midnight Sun since 1990. This largely educational enterprise is strategically situated on the edge of the stunning Saltfjellet-Svartisen National Park at the most southerly latitude where, on a summer day, the sun does not set. The Arctic Circle is clearly marked as it runs right through the saucer-shaped visitor’s center. In addition to informative displays and movies designed to educate visitors about the unique landscape and ecosystem of the polar region, the surprisingly accessible center houses a restaurant serving Norwegian food, a polar post office, a small cinema, and a gift shop. Here, visitors may purchase a polar circle certificate to prove to any doubters their prowess as a polar explorer, even if they arrived on one of the many coach trips stopping on their way toward the Nordkapp, mainland Europe’s most northerly outpost.  The Arctic Circle Centre is along the E6 Highway, which runs from Malmo in Sweden through to the Norwegian-Russian Border.

First introduced in 1993 as the “Trampe,” the bike escalator was invented by a Trondheim cyclist who was simply tired of exhausting himself climbing the hill to work each morning. To fix this issue, he developed a system by which, at the push of a button, a footplate emerges from a track in the ground to push riders up the hill. A cyclist, staying on their bike, places their right foot on the plate and it ferries both the cyclist and their ride all the way up before disappearing back into the track. The first version of the lift was taken out in 2012 and replaced with an updated version in 2013 going by the sleek new name of “CycloCable.” The new escalator included a number of safety improvements and a promotional push to increase interest in cycling in the city. The system is also being shopped to other major cities around the world so the strange lift may become more commonplace in the future. However, the prohibitive cost of the rail system (between $2,400 and $3,200 a yard) might keep the system limited to Trondheim. Each day the lift is used as a commuter transportation by travelers on bikes, riding their strollers or scooters, really anything with wheels that can support a rider.

This museum started in 1963 by a couple of enterprising locals, is dedicated to remembering life in the small Norwegian town of Hammerfest, in ages gone by. The town, which claims to be the Northernmost city in all the world, was granted an official coat of arms which featured a polar bear on a field of red, and ever since the arctic ursine has been the town’s official symbol. The museum itself features taxidermied animals and artifacts dating back to the 17th century in its single room for visitors to feel and understand the history of the local people. The museum does not charge admission, but they suggest that visitors simply purchase official membership into the royal society which comes with a welcoming pack featuring a unique polar bear pin. For even a bit more money, one can get the deluxe membership and will be “knighted” with a walrus penis.

Visnes is a small village with a population of under 600 people, but with a big claim to fame. Its once prosperous copper mine, which opened in 1865 and closed in 1972, was one of the most active mines in Norway and one of the biggest in northern Europe during its day. Despite the tiny population the village’s mine is said to have supplied the copper used to make the Statue of Liberty that now stands off the coast of New York City. There is some debate over the veracity of the claim, and its verification has been hindered by a fire that destroyed some of the mine’s old records. It is known, however, that at the time of the Statue of Liberty’s creation, the mine was owned by the company Japy Fréres, which donated all the copper used in the famed statue. Having been such a large exporter of copper, it’s easy enough to believe that at least some, if not all, of the copper came from Visnes. Regardless of the veracity of the claim, the villagers of Visnes are proud of their (alleged) contribution to one of the greatest monuments in the world, and they have their very own Lady Liberty to prove it.",statue of liberty monuments statues

Given the giant whale models on display and the real-life whaling ships you can explore, it may at least be the only whaling museum that you ever need. The museum was originally built back in 1917, marking Sandefjord’s first ever museum building. It was the brain child of one Lars Christensen, son of a shipyard owner, who set out to educate the public of the day about the plant and animal life living in Antarctica, and about the history of the whaling industry. Since its founding, the museum has continued to grow and evolve, while never losing sight of its mission to educate visitors about the great behemoths of the sea. Today the museum has a number of unique attractions that let visitors get a glimpse of the interaction of humans and whales. Inside the museum there are exhibits that track the history of the whaling industry, focusing on Norwegian whaling in particular, but spanning all of the oceans of the globe. There is also a zoological portion of the museum that features recreations of many of the common animals from the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Most impressively, there is a full-size recreation of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling of one of the galleries. Outside of the main museum building there is also the Southern Actor, a 1950s whaling vessel that is still in working order, although it is no longer used for whaling. Whaling as an industry might be an unfortunate blight on our relationship with the oceans, but it has an interesting history nonetheless. Possibly as a testament to how fascinating we find the giants of the sea in general.",whales museums and collections animals museums
182,Hrimnir Ramen,"Oslo, Norway",A microbiologist-chef is slinging noodles with hyperlocal Nordic ingredients.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hrimnir-ramen,"Jars of house-cured preserved lemons, pickled plums, and pear vinegar line the walls of Hrimnir Ramen, the Oslo eatery that puts a distinctly Norwegian spin on Japan’s beloved noodles. Both Japanese and Nordic cultures rely heavily on the locally sourced produce and the umami-oomph provided by fermentation. In 2019, Norwegian-American microbiologist David Quist opened a wholly unconventional spot that nods to both traditions. Virtually everything here is made in-house using locally farmed and foraged Norwegian ingredients. The toothsome noodles owe their distinctive flavor to emmer wheat, a heritage grain. The miso, koji, and shoyu are all fermented onsite, often from ingredients that might otherwise wind up as food waste. The deeply flavorful shoyu, for instance, comes from coffee grounds. While the familiar trappings of a ramen joint are here, the bowls’ contents aren’t like anything one would find in Tokyo. On any given day, the seasonally rotating menu might feature tan tan men cloaked in a rich hazelnut sauce with pickled sunchokes and Norwegian lamb, or perhaps a cold hiyashi chuka ramen dressed with black garlic and miso, then garnished with sea beans, Hanasand tomatoes, and radishes. The compellingly meaty vegetarian ramen gets its earthy backbone from roasted celeriac and ramson oil. Hrimnir Ramen may be unusual, but as noodle aficionados would attest, it fits the spirit of innovation that has long defined Japanese ramen. For all of the fervor it inspires, ramen is a riffable medium; some of the most celebrated chefs among Tokyo’s 10,000-plus shops are those that flaunt tradition by adding ingredients such as olive oil or Sichuan peppercorns to their broths. Quist’s restaurant isn’t so much an attempt to copy Japanese ramen, but rather a Nordic love letter to it.  Ramen may be the main draw here, but the constantly changing selection of starters are no slouch. Get the potato salad if it's on the menu.",nordic ramen noodles fermentation fermented food food

Born in 1977, Keiko was captured off Iceland at two years old and sold to an aquarium. For years, he was moved from one marine park to another, performing for the public while living in small quarters and developing skin lesions indicative of poor health. After he appeared as Willy in the “Free Willy” franchise, millions of donations led to the establishment of the Free Willy Keiko Foundation, dedicated to finding Keiko a new, better home. The Oregon Coast Aquarium built huge facilities dedicated to rehabilitating Keiko so that he could eventually be returned to the wild. Keiko, already weighing in at nearly 8,000 pounds, gained over a ton at his new home. During his extensive rehabilitation period, Keiko escaped during an open-ocean walk meant to acclimate him to the area. Even after years of preparation, Keiko was unable to cope in the wild, eventually finding his way to Skålvikfjorden in Nordmøre, where Americans who knew him previously took care of him. He died there in 2003 - the official cause is pneumonia - and was buried in a grave cairn, where visitors bring new stones to add to the growing pile.",memento mori animals
184,Bastøy Prison,"Horten, Norway","Once the scene of a young boy's home in revolt, this Norwegian island is now home to the world's first ""ecological"" prison.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bastoy-prison,"Just under 50 miles off the coast of Norway’s capitol city of Oslo is tiny Bastøy Island, more accurately known as Bastøy Prison which has a legacy of incarceration going back over a century during which the conditions have vacillated from brutality that triggered a revolt of young boys to the present humane commune of criminals. Like San Francisco’s Alcatraz, Bastøy Island proved to be a prime spot for incarceration where the natural sea barrier prevented any escape. Thus in 1900 the Bastøy boys home opened on the island and began taking in wayward young men to be reconditioned in the isolated environs. The conditions in the institution were stark and the punishment for misbehavior was draconian even by the standards of the few outsiders who visited the island. The poor treatment came to a head in 1915 when a group of boys tried to escape and when they were caught, the rest of the youths rioted, burning down a barn in the process. It took the intervention of the Norwegian military who deployed troops to the island to bring the boys in line. Unfortunately the riot changed little and the boys home remained in operation until 1970. Once the boy’s home was closed, the island was converted to a minimum-security prison that took a more humanistic approach to prison life. In Bastøy Prison, which still operates in the same conscientious manner today, the inmates are treated as part of a community. They are given jobs which they must perform, but they are also given downtime and the limited freedom to roam the island. They are roomed in well appointed cabins and fed meals prepared by a professional chef. And these are not minor offenders either. Among the over 100 inmates living on Bastøy Island are rapists, murderers, and drug smugglers. Many have raised an eyebrow at providing such an experience and calling it punishment, but only 16% of prisoners released from Bastøy Prison end up reoffending compared to Europe’s general average of 70%. The prison also sets out to be ecologically aware by having the prisoners care for the natural habitat of the island as well. In a 2012 CNN article the prison governor summed up the philosophy nicely: “If we have created a holiday camp for criminals here, so what? We should reduce the risk of reoffending, because if we don’t, what’s the point of punishment, except for leaning toward the primitive side of humanity?",prisons islands
185,Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen,"Bergen, Norway",The former home of Norway's greatest romantic composer.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/edvard-grieg-museum-troldhaugen,"This fairytale house was the home of Norway’s most famous classical composer, Edvard Grieg. He and his wife, Nina Hagerup Grieg, are both buried on the property inside a small cave down by the waterside. As a composer in the genre of romantic nationalism, Grieg was an important part of Norwegian pride before the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. Edvard Grieg was born in Bergen on the 15th of June 1843, and grew to become the most recognized Norwegian composer of all time. At the age of 15 he was accepted into a German school of music and theatre, HMT Leipzig, where he graduated three years later and travelled — not home, but to Copenhagen. In 1867 he married his cousin, Nina Hagerup, despite his parents’ protests. They only had one child, Alexandra, but she passed away at 12 months old. His music, however, continued to inspire. One of his most famous works is the “Piano Concerto in A-Minor, op 16,” composed by Grieg in 1868. In his repertoire you can also find his more mysterious musical side, in pieces like “I Dovregubbens Hall” (In the Hall of the Mountain King), “Morgenstemning,” (Morning Mood) from Peer Gynt, and “Norsk Dans” (Norwegian Dance). In 1884 he bought the property on Hop and built his Troldhaugen. But it was actually Nina who came up with the name, since it’s placed on the hill right next to Troldalen. Every summer was spent here together with his wife. Edvard Grieg died in 1907, and his wife two decades later, in 1935. Both their ashes were placed inside the mountain wall, down by the water, making him the 7th person in Norway to become cremated. Every 17th of May (the Norwegian Constitution Day) flowers are placed on their graves to honor their memory. Today the romantic nationalism of a house if filled with people as it is made a tourist attraction and a museum, open for the public. On the property you will also find a concert hall, a statue of him in person (and height), and his composer’s hut: a small red house, also down by the water. Easiest way to visit is either though tour busses or by light rail. Upon choosing lightrail depart at Hop station and follow the signs marked Toldhaugen Museum, or Edvard Grieg Museum, to Troldhaugvegen for approximately 1,7 km (there should be a map inside the stop at Hop station). Be aware this is a 20min walk and it is recommended to access the museum by tourist guide bus.",graves gravestones music museums

But in some cases, no tower is required. One example is Noviken VLF Transmitter, a military radio station in Norway. It’s used by the Norwegian Army for transmitting messages to submerged submarines. The messages are transmitted on 16.4 kHz using the callsign JXN. To move its messages, the Noviken Transmitter uses as antenna several wire spans between two large rocks with the spans directly anchored to the stone. Such antennas were used in earlier days by other stations. The former OMEGA Transmitter in Aldra, for example, had a similar antenna and also the former OMEGA station in Hawaii.

187,Diskobukta Kittiwake Colony,Norway,Thousands of birds nest in the cliffs while arctic foxes prowl below.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/diskobukta-kittiwake-colony,"Located on Barent’s Island (Barenstøya), Diskobukta is not an easy destination to visit. But it’s definitely worth the trek. Exploring the cliffs around the bay means listening to a chorus of black-footed kittiwakes squawking so loudly that conversations below a scream are close to impossible. The birds in this colony, which is well over a hundred thousand strong, build nests along the cliff walls to hatch their eggs and prepare them for flight. The birds speckle the dark, dreary rocks and soar above a shore littered with whale bones. Unfortunately for the kittiwakes, people aren’t the only ones who visit Diskobukta to witness the magnificent colony. Along the base of the cliffs, you can spot another group of parents teaching their young some life skills, much to the danger of the birds. Adult arctic foxes teach their pups how to hunt using fallen eggs and birds who happened to nest a bit too close to the ground. Though the foxes easily blend into the walls, a keen eye can catch them racing up and down the walls toward their prey. Polar bears, reindeer, and walruses have been seen within and around the bay as well. Even without the animals’ presence, the area itself is worth exploring. The canyon leading to the bay was formed by a swift stream that gushes out to the ocean. At the mouth of the stream is an impressive waterfall tucked inside a cave, though a steep drop comes right before it. Outside of the canyon are abandoned whale hunting cabins from the late 19th century.  Diskobukta, and the entire island of Barenstøya, is only accessible by boat, meaning the best way to visit is via a Svalbard marine tour. Traveling with these tours in the summer is highly recommended instead of going alone, as the threat of a polar bear attack is high.",arctic arctic circle cliffs birds animals
188,Mount Halti Peak,Norway,Citizens of Norway want to gift the peak of Mount Halti to Finland for its 100th birthday.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-halti-birthday-mountain,"When Finland declared its independence from Russia in 1917, the Finns proudly took ownership of their land of lovely lakes and Boreal forest—with one strange exception. Even though most of Mount Halti, the tallest mountain in Finland, fell within the newly drawn national borders, its peak wound up in the neighboring country of Norway, just over 1,000 vertical feet out of the Finland’s reach. That’s where Bjørn Geirr Harsson comes in. The Norwegian man has proposed moving the border just a smidge up the mountainside—about 100 feet—in order to gift the peak to its sister country, thus adding an extra 23 feet to the highest point in Finland. Harsson has literally walked across his home country as an employee for the Norwegian Mapping Authority, which is when he discovered this cruel 18th-century-drawn border. He pointed out that it makes no sense geographically—the border was drawn in a straight line without taking into account the shape of the mountain, and so the highest point in Finland is actually not its mountain’s peak, but a little ways down the slope. A small population of Sami people who live in the Lapland area surrounding the Arctic mountain do not favor the idea. They see this proposition as retroactive as the countries are placing so much importance on their borders. The Sami believe land cannot be owned and cross the border regularly. They would be happiest with no border and see this as only causing more trouble. But Harsson’s generous proposal has gained much popularity elsewhere in both countries and even around the world. People are inspired by the idea of the kindness between two countries, a rare occurrence when so many nations are so frequently at war. Many attribute this to a symbol of peace and good relations. Norway’s prime minister originally rejected the proposal but has since said she would take it under consideration. Meanwhile, Harsson and others continue to push the idea. A documentary film, Battle for Birthday Mountain, was even made to help spread the campaign. Today, people visit Mount Halti to explore the rocky and dynamic alien landscape of the Arctic Circle. One day, you may not need to cross international borders just to climb to the summit.  To get to Mount Halti from Finland, fly from Helsinki to Rovaniemi or Kittilä. There you can rent a car for about a five-and-a-half-hour or a three-and-a-half-hour drive (depending on which airport) to the small town of Kilpisjärvi. From there, you can find a well-marked trail to Halti. Keep in mind that the hike is about 50 kilometers and usually takes three to five days. You can also hike from the Norwegian side. The drive from Kilpisjärvi to lake Guolasjávri where the hike starts is two and a half hours, but the hike from there is only 14 kilometers roundtrip and takes 5-6 hours total. The downside is that to get to the trail parking from the main road you will have to drive on a gravel road which is in terrible condition. Driving 28 kilometers will take you an hour. It would be best to have a tall and durable car. You could also take a seaplane from Kilpisjärvi to one of the many surrounding lakes from which would only take a couple of hours to the top of Halti.",arctic circle borders politics mountains

The institution also houses many items from the Norwegian resistance to Nazi occupation, as well as the toll their rule inflicted on the Norwegian people. Fueled by widespread unrest after World War I, thousands joined the Nazis. As the Great Depression took hold, the Nazis, led by Adolf Hitler, blamed the Jews, Communists, liberals, and pacifists for Germany’s struggles. They promised to restore Germany’s standing in the world. Many saw the Nazis as an attractive alternative to democracy or communism. As Nazi tyranny spread across Europe, the Germans and their collaborators persecuted and murdered millions of other people seen as biologically inferior or dangerous. Norway was a neutral country during World War II, and in 1940 was invaded by Nazi forces. Until the end of the war in 1945, the Scandinavian country was occupied by the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany. This small museum in the Lofoten Islands opened in 1996, and recounts Nazi occupation of northern Norway. Their collection is large and varied, featuring both military and civilian artifacts. Objects on display include Nazi tree ornaments, dozens of Nazi uniforms, medals, and small arms. It even houses a purse which purportedly belonged to Eva Braun, Adolf Hitler’s partner. There is also a painting believed to be by Hitler himself, along with several of his drawings that were found in a house in Germany. The drawings are of characters from Disney movies, which were hidden behind the watercolor painting, possibly shortly after America joined the war.  The cost is 100kr for adults and 30kr for children. The museum's hours can be somewhat eclectic, so it's best to check before you plan your visit. The labels and stories are engaging and avoid being too dry, however many of the translations are somewhat variable in quality. Translations are in English, French, and German.

190,Roald Amundsen Monument,"Tromsø, Norway","The great polar explorer is remembered in this far northern town, where he embarked on his final expedition.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/roald-amundsen-monument,"In 1928, after 35 years of circling the globe, jumping exploration hurdles, and establishing a new standard for what it meant to be a man of discovery, Roald Engelbregt Gravning Amundsen set out to find a crew of fellow adventurers who had been lost in the arctic—and he never came back. In the island town of Tromsø there are several reminders of the great explorer and favorite son of Norway, including this slightly larger-than-life bronze statue atop a stone plinth. The statue was unveiled as a memorial to Amundsen in 1958, placed in a small park not far from his final home, looking out over the harbor. Roald Amundsen set so many records in such a short period of time, it’s hard to keep track. Originally from Borge, Norway, he is uniquely associated with arctic and Antarctic exploration, leading the first documented over-the-top trip through the Northwest Passage (a three-year slog), the first expedition to reach the South Pole, in 1911, and the first airship expedition to the North Pole, in 1926. Consequently he was the first person ever to reach both poles in one lifetime. Amundsen lived his later years in Tromsø, at the very top of Norway, 750 miles from where he was born at the very bottom. His final trip was a rescue mission from here, hoping to find the crew of fellow-explorer Umberto Nobile, who hadn’t returned from a trip to the North Pole. Amundsen’s seaplane crashed, somewhere in the Barents Sea, and neither his body, nor the bodies of the five-member crew, were ever found.  Tromsø is in far northern Norway. The monument is located in a small waterfront park near the old downtown area near the tourist information center.",lost arctic circle exploration monuments statues
191,Smeerenburg Blubber Ovens,"Amsterdam Island, Norway",These circular ruins are all that remain of a 17th-century Arctic whaling outpost.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/smeerenburg-blubber-ovens,"During the 17th century, the settlement of Smeerenburg on the Svalbard archipelago in present-day Norway was a thriving whaling outpost. Dutch and Danish whalers sailed these icy northern waters in search of blubber, which they would render in the Smeerenburg ovens. In the early 1600s, Dutch and Danish whalers came to the waters around the Svalbard archipelago, whose most profitable whaling grounds centered on the island of Spitsbergen. In 1619, the whalers founded the settlement of Smeerenburg—literally meaning “Blubber Town” —on Amsterdam Island in northwest Svalbard. The settlement was built to serve as the main outpost in the north of the archipelago, and it soon began to grow. Tales of the “booming” Smeerenburg were highly exaggerated and romanticized over the years, with claims of hundreds of ships and as many as 18,000 men visiting the settlement during the short summer seasons. It was a town with stalls and streets, churches and fortifications, gambling dens and brothels—or so the stories claimed. In reality, as later archaeological evidence showed, Smeerenburg was likely visited by perhaps 400 men and 15 ships during its peak seasons, and had around 19 buildings during its heyday in the 1630s. Still, it was an important outpost for processing the valuable blubber, which at the time required a local land-based operation. The blubber was rendered in vast copper vats placed on top of blubber ovens, whose circular foundations were made from bricks and “blubber cement.” This cement was made using a mixture of whale oil, sand, and gravel, which formed a solid base not unlike asphalt. Smeerenburg was a short-lived settlement. It was already in decline by the mid-1640s, as whale numbers dropped drastically and the processing of blubber into oil was more frequently done on return to port. The outpost was eventually abandoned around 1660 and was stripped of any useful materials. Today, the most obvious remains of Smeerenburg are the large circles of blackened rubble that once served as the foundations of the blubber ovens. The blubber cement has crumbled over the years, but the circular formations are still clear to see, marking the cooking areas where the ovens once stood. Old pieces of timber are also strewn along the beach near the ovens, as well as the bones of whales once brought ashore for processing.  The ruins of the Smeerenburg blubber ovens are located on Amsterdam Island in northwest Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean, about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. There are several landing sites used on trips to see the ovens, often depending on the direction of the wind. A number of tour operators go to Smeerenburg via Spitsbergen (the largest and only permanently populated island in the archipelago). The ovens and other artifacts are strictly protected, so make sure you follow the rules when visiting.",arctic arctic circle cooking whales islands ruins animals
192,Norwegian Canning Museum,"Stavanger, Norway",A former factory now pays tribute to a local industry fueled by sardines.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/norwegian-canning-museum,"Though they may seem like a humble foodstuff, canned sardines have played an important role in culinary history. This was particularly true for Stavanger, Norway, where canning fish was the leading industry in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This local canning heritage is celebrated at the Norwegian Canning Museum. The museum is housed in a former canning factory, which was operational from 1916 until 1958. As you walk around, you’ll get a sense of what it was like working in the factory from every level, from administration to the factory floor. The interactive museum encourages visitors to mingle among the machinery and learn about every step of the sardine-canning process, from the arrival of fresh fish (usually brisling, a type of herring) to smoking in the ovens to the canning itself. Several times a month, the museum fires up its ovens so visitors can taste freshly smoked fish. Sardine super-fans can admire the collection of 35,000 can labels or buy chocolates and cufflinks shaped like sardine cans in the gift shop. While its subject may seem ordinary, the museum offers a fun and insightful look into the history of Stavanger and Norway, through the sardine, to which they owe so much.  The museum is currently closed for renovations and scheduled to reopen in 2021. Check their website for updates.",canned fish preservation methods food museums factories fish museums
