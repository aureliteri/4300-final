0,Nimrod Fortress,Golan,"Named for the biblical warrior, the largest castle in Israel actually dates to the Middle Ages.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nimrod-fortress,"A fortified structure in the foothills of Mount Hermon, Nimrod Fortress is a physical reminder of the Crusades. The castle is named for the biblical hunter Nimrod who, according to local legend, made his home on this summit in northern Golan. During the Crusades, the Levant—a region in the Eastern Mediterranean—was getting crowded with castles, built mainly by Crusaders desperate to hold their territory against the formidable armies of Saladin. By 1192, the Third Crusade had seen significant success in taking territory around Israel and a year later, Saladin died. Saladin’s nephew Al-Aziz Othman filled the vacuum left in the region, and built himself a massive castle on a cliff in the Golan Heights to protect the loftiest reaches of the Holy Land. The Crusaders didn’t stay away for long, and the fortress was rush-ordered—it was built between 1227 and 1230—in anticipation of the return of Christian forces under Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor. The fortress withstood the Frankish attacks, as well as later attacks under King Louis IX of France, but in time, Ayyubid control slipped and control of the fortress shifted briefly to the Mongols before settling on the Mamluks. Under the Mamluk Sultan Baibars—one of the most undersung characters in the Crusades, considering his outsize role in the region—the fortress was expanded. Today, Arabic inscriptions praising Baibars remain on the site, as well as a large stone carved with his sigil, the Lion of Baibars. Nimrod Fortress is the largest castle from the Middle Ages remaining in the region. The Siege of Acre in 1291 pushed out the last of the Crusaders, and the fortress remained derelict for several centuries. Nimrod’s strategic value is unmissable, and following the Crusades, the fortress was used by the Ottomans, the French (who were occupying the land, and suppressing revolts by local Arabs and Druze), and the Syrian army during the Six Day War. Today, the castle is under the control of Israel’s national park service, but being so far North, is off the beaten path of most tourists. It is most regularly populated by a smattering of rock hyrax—rodent-looking relatives of the elephant, who take to the fallen Crusader masonry as if they were rocks.  The castle is most accessible by car, but can also be accessed by rail and bus (if both, by transferring at Kiryat Shmona). Around the fortress are a number of Druze villages, and just a few miles west there are remarkable ruins of a Greek temple at Hermon Spring. It takes about an hour and a half to fully walk through the castle grounds, which stretches along the crest of one of Hermon’s foothills. In the summer, Nimrod Fortress National Park is open Sunday through Thursday and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. In the winter, it is open Sunday through Thursday and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. The castle closes an hour earlier on Fridays and holiday eves. Entrance to the park closes one hour before closing time. Tickets are ₪22 for adults and ₪9 for children.",crusades fortresses castles medieval
1,Rujm el-Hiri,"Rujm el-Hiri, Golan",Tens of thousands of rocks make up what is thought to be a giant star calendar.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rujm-el-hiri,"One of the more mysterious archeological sites in the Golan Heights region, Rujm el-Hiri is a wide series of piled stone rings that scientists have not been able to definitively date or decode since their discovery, although there are a number of theories. The megalithic wonder consists of five circles of piled up basalt rocks surrounding a central cairn that was once a tomb before grave-robbers picked it clean. Other smaller stone lines connect the rings in places creating a seemingly more meaningful design. The central stack stands around 15 feet high, in contrast to the surrounding rings which are generally around 8 feet tall. When excavations at the site began they found that it had once contained a tomb, but that had been long since cleaned out, leaving nothing behind. With no organic data to sample, the actual age of the construction is impossible to determine, but it was likely created around 3000 BCE. Thought of as the sort of Stonehenge of the area, Rujm el-Hiri has no lack of theories surrounding its use. Given the tomb at its center, some researchers have theorized that the site was related to a death ritual of some kind, possibly even being a site where the dead would be laid out to be devoured by birds. Others have suggested that the formation was some kind of ancient church to megalithic gods. However the most prevalent modern theory is that the rings were used as a celestial calendar that could measure the equinoxes and assist in primitive astronomy. Whatever the original use for the site was, its mysterious origins continue to fuel wonder and speculation to all who make the trek to the stone rings.  Warning: This site is in an Israeli army firing zone and it is adjacent to old mine fields. Extreme caution should be taken if you're trying to reach it.",megalithic stonehenge astronomy
2,Quneitra,Golan,Ghost Town in the Demilitarized Zone of the Golan Heights.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quneitra,"Quneitra is the destroyed and abandoned capital city of the Quneitra Governorate. The area is under Syrian control within the UN-patrolled demilitarized zone between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The Golan Heights was occupied in the course of the Six Day War of 1967. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War the city was recaptured by Syrian forces but was once again occupied by Israel in a counter-offensive. After the 1974 ceasefire, Israeli troops withdrew from Quneitra. Before handing Quneitra back to Syria, the Israelis evacuated the population, and then systematically destroyed the buildings of the city selling anything movable to Israeli contractors – a move which was heavily condemned by the UN. The late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad ordered that the city shall not be rebuilt and since then the ruins have become something of a propaganda exhibit. Today the ruins of the flattened houses of the city, which once had a population of 20,000, provide an eerie atmosphere, reminiscent of post-apocalyptic films. To visit Quneitra a permit must be obtained from the Syrian Ministry of Interior in Damascus. Any visit is accompanied by Syrian military personnel to protect visitors from wandering off into the minefields that surround the city.",ghost towns
3,Ein Keshatot (Spring of the Arches),Golan,"This sixth-century synagogue was first reconstructed digitally, then in real life.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ein-keshatot,"During the sixth century, a small but wealthy Jewish village in Golan Heights constructed a large synagogue. The synagogue stood for three centuries before a devastating earthquake in 749 destroyed the entire village. The village and its impressive synagogue have lain in ruins ever since. That is, until 2003 when engineer Yehoshua Dray and archeologist Chaim Ben-David began a project with an ambitious goal of reconstructing the ancient synagogue at Ein Keshatot (also known as Umm el-Qanatir). Digital scans were taken of each stone block, and then a computer program was used to virtually reconstruct the synagogue. In 2010, the physical reconstruction finally began. Using the computer-generated rendering, a large crane was used to place each stone into its correct position. In 2016, the project was finally completed, and in 2018, the site was opened to the public. Elaborate carvings of menorahs and the Four Species can still be seen on the synagogue’s walls and columns. Some of these carvings decorate a stone ark, that miraculously survived the 749 earthquake. At the other end of the village, two large arches overlook a spring and pool of water. This was the industrial area of town where linen would have been manufactured. While no linen is made here today, the spring still flows, and the arches still stand over a pool of water that would’ve been used to clean flax thousands of years ago. These arches are also how the village got its name—Ein Keshatot translates to “Spring of Arches.” The site is on the edge of a cliff overlooking Nahal Samach, a deep gorge, and provides stunning views of the valley stretching towards the Sea of Galilee.  The site is small and takes only an hour to visit. The visitors’ center has a small display of archeological finds from the village and screens a documentary (Hebrew with English subtitles) about the reconstruction of the synagogue. There are still active archeological digs at Ein Keshatot. Occasionally, there are opportunities for visitors to take part in the digs.

4,Habokrim Restaurant,"Merom Golan, Golan",Saddle up to Israel's only cowboy-themed bar for a hearty (and kosher) steak.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/habokrim-restaurant,"Located on a kibbutz that offers a number of traditionally Western pastimes such as horseback riding and cattle wrangling, the Habokrim Restaurant tries to provide a real Wild West experience while keeping to Jewish law. Despite being located in a tumultuous area of Golan Heights near the Syrian border, the ranchers of the Merom Golan kibbutz continue to raise beef cattle in much the same fashion as Western cowboys have for over a century. The area’s unique climate and flora make it an ideal spot to raise the livestock and also tends to attract a number of tourists to the area. For those visitors who don’t want to get their hands dirty in the actual farm, the kibbutz offer the Habokrim Restaurant which has all the theme with none of the mess. The eatery is located inside of a modern-built wood building, meant to look like a log construction from the 1800’s. Inside, diners can sidle up to the rustic tables and take in the Old West themed decorations. The menu offers hearty cowboy fare such as steaks, kebabs, and grilled lamb chops, all kosher and made from the fresh meat of the local livestock. The Habokrim Restaurant sits right next to a working horse corral so diners might even get to eat along with some actual Israeli cowboys, an experience most Wild West enthusiasts haven’t even considered.",wild west restaurants shops
5,Shah Cheragh,"Shiraz, Iran",Mirrors and glass shards cover every inch of this arrestingly beautiful mosque.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shah-cheragh,"Visiting the Shah Cheragh mosque in Shiraz, Iran can be a somber and, for lack of a better word, religious experience, yet the interior of the central temple looks as though a disco ball exploded, covering nearly every surface with glittering shards of glass and mirror. The site began as a funereal monument with a mythic past. As the story goes, around 900 CE a wanderer caught site of a mysterious light shining off in the distance and went to investigate. He found a luminous grave that, when excavated, was found to hold the armored corpse of an important Muslim figure. Thus the site became a popular pilgrimage site for Shia Muslims, and a domed tomb structure was created to house the grave. The site was improved and expanded over the centuries with religious schools and other facilities being added to the complex. In the 14th century the site’s signature mirrorball decoration was ordered at the behest of Queen Tash Khātūn who wanted the mosque intensify any light a thousand times over, the name “Shah Cheragh” roughly translating to “King of the Light” in Persian. Despite being damaged by human hands and natural disasters over the centuries, the mosque has been maintained and repaired and shines brightly even today. The increasingly sprawling site is still an extremely important pilgrimage location for Shia Muslims, however visitors of any faith are likely to marvel at the sheer beauty of this glassy wonder.",mosques temples
6,Badab-e Surt,"Orost, Iran",Iran's colorful terraces are a rare geological masterpiece.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/badab-e-surt,"Iridescent pools of water gather on beds of rust-colored travertine. The colorful puddles top each layer of rock at Iran’s Badab-e Surt, blanketing the naturally formed terraces and transforming them into an exquisite sight alight with fiery hues. The scenery is breathtaking. Badab-e Surt is a rare geological masterpiece, formed during the Pleistocene and Pliocene epochs. Only a handful of such places exist in the world. A similar natural wonder has already been lost. This site was crafted by nature after two different mineral hot springs spent thousands of years sending water bubbling down the mountain from over 6,000 feet above sea level. When the water cooled, it left behind its carbonate minerals in a jelly-like substance that eventually hardened to give the slope its current staircase shape. One of the hot springs spews salty water that’s said to have healing properties. Supposedly, it can cure ailments such as rheumatism and certain skin conditions. The other spring spurts a sour sediment full of oxide which gives the water its beautiful orange tint. The place gets its name from a combination of the Persian words for “gassed water” and the old name of the nearest village, which means “intensity.” When the light hits the terraces just right, it makes the puddles glow with the red, orange, and yellow tones found in the underlying rock. Reflections from the sky and clouds above will sometimes add swirls of blue and gray to the mix, creating a watercolor palette bursting with rich natural hues.  Badab-e Surt can be a bit tough to get to, though it’s a place worth seeking out nonetheless. It’s just shy of 60 miles from the city of Sari. The journey there requires winding along isolated roads and stretches of unpaved mountain passes.",beauty hot springs color natural wonders water geology nature
7,The Ruins of Persepolis,"Fars Province, Iran","The palace of the King of Kings, burned by Alexander the Great.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ruins-of-persepolis-fars-province-iran,"Persepolis was once the richest city on earth - the glittering capital of the Achaemenid Empire. At the heart of the city lay the royal palace - a wonder of gold and silver, ivory, and precious stones. From there, Xerxes planned his war against Greece - and the treasure of a vast empire piled up in the store-rooms. In 330 BCE, Persepolis was captured by Alexander the Great. Before he left the city, he ordered the palace burned to the ground - whether through drunken malice or sober calculation, it is impossible to be sure. Today, the haunting, spectacular ruins of Persepolis reveal both the glory of the Achaemenid Empire, and the abruptness of its passing. The palace is still marked by Alexander’s fire: three feet of ash covered the floor in some places when it was first excavated - and many of the columns are still visibly scarred by those flames which burned over two thousand years ago.",ancient ruins

With dazzling stained glass, thousands of painted tiles on the ceiling and Persian rugs covering the floor, this place of worship is a gorgeous rainbow of color in every direction, like stepping into a kaleidoscope. Inside the mosque is an open courtyard with a rectangular pool in the center, surrounded by flowers. The building’s facade features dozens of arabesque arches, adding to the beauty of the light show from the stained glass. Nasir al-Mulk Mosque was constructed between 1876 and 1888, during the Qajar dynasty, which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925. It has been dubbed the “Pink Mosque” due to the plethora of pink-colored tiles blanketing the ceiling.

9,Yakhchāls,"Meybod, Iran",Ancient structures used to make and preserve ice in the deserts of Persia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yakhchals,"Though they look like giant clay beehives, these structures in the deserts of Persia were used to make something much more needed and much harder to come by there than honey in ancient times: ice. Yakhchāls, ancient evaporation coolers, came into being around 400 BC. The giant conical structures allowed ice to be made and collected during the colder months and used throughout the year for things like preserving food and making faloodeh, a traditional Persian frozen dessert made with thin noodles and semi-frozen syrup. Different design features kept different yakhchāls cool, from spiral structures to wind towers and vents. Some yakhchāls had holes near the bottom, to keep cool air flowing into the vast underground portion of the structure where the ice was made and kept, and holes near the top through which hot air would be funneled out. Walls were often built to keep the water shaded as it was channeled in to the yakhchāls so it would freeze faster. Yakhchāls also served as places to store ice that was brought down from nearby mountains and often food as well. The extremely thick waterproof and heat resistant walls were made of a special mixture of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, goat hair, and ash called sarooj. Many of these monuments to ancient Persian ingenuity are still around today, hundreds of years later. One of the easiest to find is the one near the Narin Castle in Meybod, Iran, but there are also some in Iranian cities like Yazd and Kerman.",cooling towers wind ice architectural oddities food architecture
10,Alamut Castle,"Roudbar Alamout, Iran",This ruined fortress was the stronghold for a persecuted medieval leader and his infamous Assassins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alamut-castle,"Alamut Castle was originally built in the ninth century at an elevation over 6,800 feet. It was constructed in such a way that it only had one passable entrance that wound its way around the cliff, making the fortress difficult to conquer. But in 1090 A.D., a man named Hassan-i Sabbah was able to do just that. Hassan was an Ismaili Shia, which was a sect of Islam that faced heavy persecution from the region’s ruling leader. He rallied supporters as he hid within the valleys of Alamut. Eventually, he and his followers were able to concoct a plan that let them take over the fortress without spilling a single drop of blood (Hassan supposedly even paid the ousted ruler for the site). The fortress became a stronghold for him and his followers, who came to be referred to as his Assassins. They updated the castle’s irrigation and strengthened its defenses. And, perhaps most notably, they built an exquisite library full of literature about astronomy, math, philosophy, and even alchemy. Hassan created his own state, using the other fortresses scattered throughout the remote mountains and valleys as bases. He and his followers did more than just strengthen their strategic hideouts: They were also accomplished killers. The Assassins used their skills against the rulers of the Seljuk Empire who had been persecuting their sect. However, they also turned their attention beyond northern Iran and faced foreign enemies such as Crusaders. They were meticulous in killing the targeted individual, attempting to do so without any additional casualties. They cultivated their reputation by slaying victims in public, often in mosques. Their weapon of choice is said to have been a dagger. Mongolian invaders conquered the castle in the 13th century. They demolished the fortress and burned most of the rare contents that had been safeguarded in its library. But the stories of the Assassin’s fortress still live on. The most prominent historical fallacy was spread by Marco Polo in his stories about an “Old Man of the Mountains.” According to his accounts, devotees were drugged to simulate dying and then left to awaken in a secret garden where wine flowed and feasts were served by virgins. When they later awoke, there they were informed that if they wished to return to the paradise they had enjoyed, it would be at Hassan’s discretion and that they must therefore follow his orders directly. The site is a spectacular and sometimes hair-raising four hour’s drive through the mountains from Qazvin and located near the village of Gazorkhan. The walk up to Alamut is quite hard, but the views from the fortress are quite something. Archaeologists have restored the castle and there are explanatory signs in both English and Farsi.",assassination fortresses castles medieval religion sacred spaces ruins history
11,Nushabad Underground City,"Nushabad, Iran","A 1,500-year-old, 3-story subterranean city where ancient Persians took refuge in times of war.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nushabad-underground-city,"Just north of Kashan, in the small town of Nushabad, Iran (also spelled Noosh Abad), lies a sprawling underground city. Despite its impressive scale, the ancient buried shelter was completely unknown until a decade ago, when an oblivious resident stumbled upon a tunnel while digging a sewage ditch in his home. What was discovered was an extensive, 1,500-year-old underground city, set between 3 to 18 meters (10 to 60 feet) deep. The labyrinthine network was comprised of three stories of tunnels, chambers, air ducts, staircases, canals, and booby traps. It’s considered a marvel of ancient architecture and engineering. Construction of this man-made subterranean city, called Ouee (or Ouyi), dates back to the Sasanian (or Neo-Persian) Empire that ruled from 224 to 651. Inhabitants would dig underground chambers as hideout spots for women, children, and the elderly in the event of an attack by foreign invaders. Over the years, the individual chambers were amalgamated, and air ducts, water pipes, storage spaces, and toilets were all built—creating a sustainable underground city that was used as a refuge during times of war. Each family had their own room of sorts, with a tunnel running down the length of these rooms, similar to a hotel hallway. Parts of the underground city are open to tourists year round. From Kashan, you will need to take a cab and simply ask the driver to take you to the underground city.",bunkers subterranean underground engineering tunnels subterranean sites war history ancient military architecture
12,Zoroastrian Towers of Silence,"Yazd, Iran","Putrefaction plateaus in Iran, where the dead were sent for decontamination before going to their final resting place.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zoroastrian-towers-of-silence,"Until 40 years ago, corpses could still be found on top of the Towers of Silence in Yazd, Iran, slowly disintegrating or being picked apart by desert vultures. In the Zoroastrian tradition, once someone has died, their body can immediately be contaminated by demons and made impure. To prevent this infiltration, Zoroastrians purified the dead body by exposing it to the elements and local fowl on top of flat-topped towers called dakhmas in the desert. According to a tradition dating back over 3,000 years, bodies were arranged on the towers in three concentric circles. Men were placed in the outer circle, women in the middle, and children in the inner-most ring. The bodies were then left until their bones were bleached by the elements and stripped by the vultures. After the purification process, the bones were placed in ossuaries near or inside of the towers. Ossuaries from these rituals have been discovered from the fourth and fifth centuries BC. Similar dakhmas exist just outside of Mumbai, India, as well, although the most prominent “Towers of Silence” are in Iran. As Iran developed and urbanized, dakhmas became increasingly closer to city limits, severely curtailing their use. Since the 1970s, the use of dakhmas has been illegal in Iran, forcing orthodox Zoroastrians to adapt to new burial methods. Many in the Zoroastrian community have moved to burying bodies beneath concrete to keep out all contaminants. Although the towers are no longer used in ceremony, they can be visited along with a number of the ossuaries in the area.",catacombs catacombs and crypts death cemeteries

But actually, the elaborate system of waterworks was built by different civilizations over centuries of development. The beginnings of the now-extensive Shushtar Hydraulics date back to the 5th century BCE, when the system was believed to have been initiated by Persian king Darius the Great. Water was diverted from the Karun River via man-made canals that sent the flow through tunnels dug through the natural rock. The complete system was likely in place by the 3rd century CE, having incorporated the work and knowhow of various civilizations including the Mesopotamians and the Romans. Through the system of tunnels and pools, water is diverted to the city of Shushtar, powering several mills. At the time of its building the elaborate system of dams, tubes, and mills must have seemed like technological wizardry, and today it still seems amazing. The system was in use into the 20th century, providing power to Shushtar, albeit probably not as efficiently as it did before time and erosion took their toll. But considering that it was centuries old, a bit of slippage can be forgiven. Active use of the system was eventually scrapped, as its uses were replaced with more modern irrigation techniques. UNESCO has declared the system a world heritage site, so hopefully it won’t go out of commission anytime soon.

The island is actually more similar to Miami and is marked with luxuriant beaches and shopping malls. It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Middle East, yet most tourists seem to overlook a beautiful work of Persian architectural history, the Kariz-e-Kish or Kish Qanat. Before the Roman aqueduct, the people of pre-Islamic Iran had developed their own hydraulic system called a qanat. A qanat is a series of vertical wells, built along a gentle slope to filter water toward arid areas. The Kish Qanat is an excellent example of this ancient technology and provides visitors with an opportunity to get face to face with the infrastructure of this amazing hydraulic system. The Kish Qanat is over 2,500 years old and filters water from the mountains to the dry valleys below through layers of the coral that comprise the island’s foundation. Kish is one of the only islands in the world that is made up of coral, and tunneling into the earth there allows for a unique look at the usually underwater specimen. Sixteen meters below the coral island, a series of tunnels near the wells snake through the earth for more than five miles. As the tunnels cut below the world, the Kish Qanat begins to look more like a massive underground city. Lately, architects hoping to draw tourists to the attraction have embraced that idea even more. Along with the historic coral walls around the qanat, workers have reinforced the tunnels with mortar and stone to create a subterranean world. Soon, visitors can peruse an update on the early hydraulic system that will feature vendors selling typical Iranian gifts along with a few subterranean restaurants and an amphitheater. Strangely enough, the unique historic element of the island is slowly mimicking its inner tourism side.",follies and grottoes outsider architecture subterranean sites architectural oddities architecture
15,Radkan Tower,Iran,A sophisticated astronomical tower built by one of the greatest Persian scholars of the Islamic Golden Age.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/radkan-tower,"Standing some 100 feet tall on a hillock in northeastern Iran, this curious cylindrical tower was long assumed to be an ancient tomb, or perhaps a beacon guiding travelers in the area. In fact, it’s likely it was something much more spectacular. Thanks to the discoveries of an archeo-astronomer, it’s now believed the Radkan Tower was an incredibly sophisticated instrument of astronomical science built nearly 800 years ago. The yellow-brick tower dates to the mid-13th century and was created by one of the greatest Persian scholars of the age, Nasir al-Din Tusi. A polymath, scientist, and astronomer, Tusi is known for helping found the pioneering observatory at Maragheh, Azerbaijan, which, along with the Radkan Tower, collected invaluable information about the stars and sky during a period of remarkable scientific discovery. The tower has 12 walls corresponding to the 12 months in a year, with 36 columns around the exterior, topped with a conical roof. On the days of the solstice and equinox each year, the sun is aligned perfectly to shine through the doors on opposite sides of the tower. It’s also believed the structure can determine the beginning of the four seasons, leap years, and the start of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year.",islam observatories astronomy towers science history
16,Naqsh-e Rustam,Iran,The ancient necropolis houses the immense rock-cut tombs of four Persian kings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/naqshe-rustam,"Naqsh-e Rustam is an impressive necropolis that stands as a reminder of the once famous and powerful Achaemenid Persian Empire, which thrived between 500 BC and 330 BC when it was defeated by Alexander the Great. The complex has been somewhat overshadowed by the nearby ancient capital of Persepolis, but this royal necropolis does stand out as a magnificent example of ancient Persian architecture and art. The tombs are hewn into the rock at a significant height from the base of the hills, and bear the resemblance of crosses, hence the site is locally known as the “Persian Crosses.” The necropolis consists of four rock-cut tombs holding the remains of Achaemenid rulers. Only one has been identified with certainty: the great Persian king, Darius I. Archaeologists believe the other three kings buried here are Xerxes I, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II. At the centre of the cross are openings leading to the chamber where the sarcophagi may have been placed. In fact, it is not known whether the bodies were directly placed in a sarcophagus inside the tombs or if the bones were collected from a Tower of Silence and subsequently placed in the tombs, in the traditional Zoroastrian ritual. Above the openings of each tomb are carvings of kingly figures being anointed by god-like creatures.  There are other rock carvings below the cross-hewn tombs commemorating various battles that brought the Achaemenid dynasty to prominence. One carving actually seems to predate the tombs, suggesting that this ancient site had been used by people even before the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Aside from the tombs, a building also stands at the necropolis. Called Ka’ba-ye Zartosht, (Cube of Zoroaster), it is a replica of the Zendān-e Solaymān (Prison of Solomon) in Pasargadae, the first dynastic capital of the Achaemenid Empire. It was once thought that this structure was the site of a perennially burning fire common in Zoroastrian temples, but the lack of ventilation suggests otherwise. Although there is currently no consensus as to the specific use of this structure, it is widely accepted that it served a religious function. On the walls of this building are relatively well-preserved inscriptions in three languages.",empire tombs royalty death burial places ancient religion archaeology sacred spaces
17,Nashtifan Windmills,"Nashtifan, Iran","The vertical-axis windmills of ancient Persia have been grinding flour for 1,000 years and counting.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nashtifan-windmills,"Located on the arid and windswept plains of northeastern Iran, 30 miles from the Afghan border, the small village of Nashtifan is keeping ancient traditions alive amid the winds of change. The town is home to some of the earliest windmills in the world, and the structures are still in use today. Along the southern edge of town, a towering 65-foot-tall earthen wall shelters residents from the abrasive gales. The high wall houses two dozen mostly functional vertical axis windmills that date back to ancient Persian times. It’s estimated the structures, made of clay, straw, and wood, are around 1,000 years old, used for milling grain into flour. The area is known for its uniquely powerful winds, and in fact the name Nashtifan is derived from words that translate to “storm’s sting.” During turbulent winter months the handcrafted wooden blades whirl with a surprising velocity and power grindstones in a marvel of engineering and passive ventilation. With periodic repairs to turbines, these well-built earthen structures could go on for centuries so long as there are caretakers willing to maintain them. The tall walls framing the windmills both support the turbines, and funnel the airflow like the elliptical throat in a primitive windtunnel. Unlike European Don Quixote-style windmills, the Persian design is powered by drag as opposed to lift. And since the blades are arrayed on a vertical axis, energy is translated down the mast to the grindstone without the need for any of the intermediary gears found on horizontal axis windmills. The windy pride of Nashtifan, the structures are doted on by an amiable custodian named Ali Muhammed Etebari, who estimates that parts of the earthen windmills are 1,000 years old. Etebari draws no salary from his unofficial village occupation, but told a film crew with the International Wood Culture Society, with a raspy laugh and finger jab, “If I don’t look after them, the youngsters will come and spoil it and break everything.”",ancient technology wind windmills energy power stations weather deserts engineering technology ancient

While, like other caves of chalk, marble or gypsum the rock is dissolved by water that seeps in through cracks, unlike the other caves, changes in the shape of the salt cave can be over days rather then over millennia. Salt caves are fragile things, created and destroyed in a few hundred years. “In limestone caves you can see signs saying don’t touch the dripstones, they have been growing for thousands of years, whereas in the salt caves they grow for days or weeks after rain, when rainwater penetrates the rock, saturates it and in a month there are half-a-metre dripstones. We can practically watch them grow.” So said Michal Filippi one member of the Czech project Namak (which means salt in Persian) team which has been exploring this cave for over a decade. Filippi and Jiri Bruthans, who both started as students following their professor into the extremely hot cave in 1997. “We were there in 1997 in the summer which was not a very clever idea because it is very hot there. The idea came from our professor Pavel Bosak who had worked there in 1990 and he found that in the area there were many large salt karsts and many caves and he could hardly find any information in the literature. He was giving a lecture at Charles University and we realized that this could be a very interesting place, so we tried to visit it.” Though the caves change rapidly, they are generally safe for the explorers. The caves tend to stay relatively dry and stable for long periods of time, often years, before sudden rains cause flash floods and subsequent corrosion of the salt and enlargement of the caves. During these times the salt caves are quite dangerous and cannot be entered. The Czech team, having been the first to discover the caves, alongside their Iranian counterparts, got the chance to name many of the structures and areas of the caves. “One of the caves is Ghar-e Daneshjoo which means The Students’ Cave because the students were the main people who were carrying out the research in it.” One can only wonder how the Jeskyne Tri nahacu or “Cave of Three Naked Men” came to have its name.  Namakdan Mountain, Qeshm Island. The salt cave is found in the western part of the island. Just follow the signs with 'Salt caves' and you'll find your way.

19,Ali Sadr Cave,"Ali Sadr, Iran","This vast, water-filled underground labyrinth can only be toured by boat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ali-sadr-cave,"With a network of channels, lakes, and watery passageways spreading out over several kilometers, Ali Sadr Cave (غار علی صدر) is one of the largest subterranean water complexes in the world. Stable since its formation millions of years ago, the sunless grottoes feature clear waters, fantastical rock formations, and stalactite-covered ceilings soaring high overhead. Unlike many other aquatic caves, the body of water in Ali Sadr is not a flowing river, but rather an extensive, web-like lake seemingly fed by spring waters from nearby Sarab Cave. Visitors to Ali Sadr are conducted to an underground wharf where they board boats that take them gliding silently through this chain of flooded chambers. Colorful, glittering geological structures cover the tunnel walls above and below the surface of the water, which is clear enough to provide visibility to a depth of five meters. Tight, winding passageways branch off endlessly from one another, or open up into massive rooms like the Wedding Room (also called the 1000 Stalactites Room), the Island (which sits at the center of the complex), and the 600-meter-long Freedom Hall (the largest chamber in the network). Prehistoric paintings, pitchers, and jugs found onsite indicates that the cave were inhabited by early humans starting 12,000 years ago. An additional entrance to Ali Sadr was constructed during the reign of Darius I (521-485 BCE), but at some point after that the cave was apparently forgotten, being rediscovered only in 1963. Since then it has been explored by mountaineers and geologists from both Iran and abroad. Its known extent at this point stretches over 11 kilometers, with its longest passage mapped thus far running almost the same distance. The standard tour takes visitors on a 2100-meter journey through Ali Sadr Cave, 1470 meters of which is covered by boat—making it one of the longest underground boat trips in the world. Expect to spend an hour getting there from Hamadan. There are shuttles and taxis that go to and from the cave regularly. Best to get there early in the morning, especially on Fridays or holidays when it's likely to be more crowded. Bring a jacket, the cave is chilly and wear comfortable shoes. Though you'll be traversing the cave mostly by boat, there is quite a bit of walking, including stairs. Total tour takes about 2-3 hours depending on whether you choose the ""old"" path or ""new"" path.",grottoes boats subterranean subterranean sites caves ecosystems water
20,Troglodyte Village of Kandovan,"Kandovan, Iran",Modern-day cave dwellers carve elaborate homes out of volcanic debris.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/troglodyte-village,"Tucked away in the remote northwest corner of Iran is a village where residents live as modern-day cave dwellers. Current residents of Kandovan, a tourist village in the province of East Azerbaijan, claim that their village is more than 700 years old. It was created, they say, when those fleeing the advancing Mongol army took to the caves to hide. The homes are known as “karan” in the local Turkic dialect, a word that roughly translates as the plural of beehive. The Kandovan village has an unusual look that resembles a gigantic termite colony more than it does traditional caves. The structures were formed by ash and debris from Mount Sahand when the now-dormant volcano erupted sometime in the last 11,000 years. Over the course of thousands of years, the ash hardened and was carved out by the elements. In the surrounding region, the ash blanketed the land in a more traditional pattern. Over the years, the people of the village have expanded their residences. Now, most cave dwellings range from two to four stories complete with living areas, a storage room and an animal shelter. Many have porches, windows, doors and stairwells carved into the rock. The caves are some of the most energy efficient homes on Earth, with the rock providing adequate insulation to keep the interiors comfortable throughout the long cold season. The homes also remain cool in the summer.",lost tribes outsider architecture eccentric homes geological oddities caves homes ecosystems geology
21,Pigeon Towers of Iran,"Isfahan, Iran",These little castles each held thousands of pigeons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pigeon-towers-iran,"For most city dwellers, pigeons are categorized along with rats, cockroaches and mice as vermin. Not so in 16th and 17th century Iran. Domesticated, pigeons were a valuable resource, or rather, their poop was. Rich in nitrogen, pigeon guano was used across Iran as a natural fertilizer for melon and cucumber fields. To gather this precious resource, homes were built for the pigeons. Often over six stories high and 45 to 75 feet in diameter, these towering structures were filled with a honeycomb of small roosts for the pigeons. Each tower held as many as 14,000 pigeons. The towers are also an amazing example of architectural theme and variation, each based on one of eight traditional forms, but unique in its particular architecture. Once numbering in the thousands, many of the towers are now falling apart. Today, due to the use of artificial fertilizer, only a few hundred pigeon towers remain operational. The remaining towers are clustered largely in the Isfahan region of Iran.",dovecotes pigeons outsider architecture towers birds animals
22,Deir-e Gachin Caravanserai,Iran,One of the largest and oldest caravansaries in Persia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/deire-gachin-caravanserai,"The Iranian desert is peppered with long-abandoned caravansaries, sprawling inns centered around large rectangular courtyards where caravans of merchants would rest, trade, and stay the night before continuing their long journey along the Silk Road. Located along the ancient trade route between Rey and Qom is one of the largest and oldest of the Persian caravansaries, Deir-e Gachin, often called the “mother of all Iranian caravansaries.” Most reports date Deir-e Gachin back to the Sassanian dynasty, between 334 and 651 CE, when it was possibly built as a fortified fire temple. But much of what is seen today was built centuries later after the structure was restored during the Safavid dynasty in the 16th through 18th centuries when caravansaries flourished along the Silk Road. Deir-e Gachin is laid out like many Persian caravansaries, forming a huge open courtyard in the shape of a perfect square. Surrounding the courtyard are dozens of guest rooms and camel stables for merchants to post up for the night. The caravanserai is unique, though, in that each corner was built to serve a different purpose: a mill in the northwest, a bathhouse and kitchen in the southwest, a private apartment in the northeast, and a mosque in the southeast. Today the Deir-e Gachin Caravanserai is situated in the middle of Kavir National Park, on the western edge of Iran’s Dasht-e Kavir, or “Great Salt Desert.” Visiting this remote landscape is a rare and memorable experience, as the pristine environment is protected from any human settlement. Spending the night under the desert stars, far from the light and noise of the city, you can imagine what life may have been like for the merchants that traversed the desert centuries ago.  On weekdays during summer there are various activities for visitors held at the Deir-e Gachin Caravanserai (spelled Deyr Gachin on Google Maps), such as horse and camel rides, live performances of traditional music, and observation of the Moon and stars at night. Reservations can be made on the (Persian-language) website. You will need an off-road vehicle to visit Kavir National Park, or can book a guided tour in advance.

Today, the mosque stands as a magnificent and detailed public work. However, when it was originally built it was a private and luxurious place of worship for Shah Abbas I and the women of his court. Lavished with elaborate calligraphy of Quranic verses and multi-colored mosaics, the mosque is definitely fit for a king. Every tile was laid with precision and the main dome is dominated by a peacock that changes color and shape as light reflects off of the mosque’s interior. Adjacent to the mosque is the Ali Qapu palace, where Shah Abbas resided with a sizable harem. Along with commissioning the mosque, Shah Abbas also commissioned an underground passageway between the palace and the place of worship. This allowed the women of his harem to secretly make their passage to the mosque without being seen by passerby on the square, thus giving the building its nickname, the Women’s Mosque. During the 17th century after it was built, the mosque was not open to the public, and served only as a private sanctuary. Today, it is open to everyone and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",outsider architecture sacred spaces

The hyper-arid desert is one of the hottest and driest places on the planet. Those who brave a visit will soon discover the beautifully strange scenery that make this place one of a kind. Iran’s Lut Desert is often called the hottest place on Earth—though that depends on how you’re defining “hottest.” To be precise, the Lut holds the record for having the Earth’s hottest surface temperature, which can climb as high as 159 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius). In any case, this scorching superlative is not the only thing that makes this region unique. The desert is speckled with gigantic rock formations, some of the tallest sand dunes in the world, salt plains, sinkholes, forgotten castles, and friendly wolves that roam around at night. Camp outside under the stars and you will feel tiny between the surreal rock formations. Visitors, of course, are advised not to explore Lut Desert in the summer; however, beware that in winter and spring the nighttime temperatures drop below zero. Lut is the Arabic name for the Prophet Lot. This is the same Lot of the Old Testament, and the Qu’ran, related to be the messenger sent by God to Sodom and Gomorrah.   Visiting the desert is easy. Either drive yourself towards Shahbad and then some more, park your car on the side of the road, and run around a little bit (not too far). The road goes straight through the desert. Or, even better, have one of the many guides in Kerman drive you there in a 4x4, so you can actually go deep into the desert.",dunes martian landscapes environment rock formations deserts natural wonders ecosystems nature

It lacks the throngs of tourists that fill its more famous counterparts, making it easy to spend hours exploring its miles of hidden alleys and colorful stores without getting lost in the crowd. The historic bazaar in Kashan is full of winding passageways, concealed yards, tombs, and small mosques, all interspersed among stores selling vibrant goods. The marketplace and its network of passageways contain historic treasures like an 800-year-old mosque and historic bath houses that have since been converted to tea shops. Its stores sell gorgeous goods like traditional rugs and textiles as well as tasty treats. When you’re done exploring all the indoor market has to offer, be sure to head to the roof. There, you’ll find sweeping views of a landscape dotted with domes, all containing the bazaar’s colorful world beneath their pale tan exteriors. Though the bazaar’s caravanserai and its stunning kaleidoscope domed roof only date to 1868, the marketplace has been a trade hub for centuries.

The tiny village has existed in the area for around 1,000 years and the strange stacked building tradition seems to have existed nearly the entire time. Looking almost like a clay-covered rendition of Brazil’s cramped favelas in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janiero, the communities of Masuleh make much better use of the space. Atop the roofs of many of the cascading houses, lawns have been planted and other traditional yard fixtures have been laid out by the tenant above who in turn is covered by the front yard of their upstairs neighbor, and so on. So tightly packed are the buildings that there is only room for a maze-like network of stairs and narrow roads connecting each of the structures. In fact automobiles are not allowed in Masuleh simply because there is no room for them. The landscape surrounding Masuleh is lush and mountainous with a frequent covering of dense fog, so much so that many of the homes in the town are covered in bright yellow clay so they can be seen better through the haze.

The ancient flame has been kept alive throughout various centuries and relocations, and continues to burn today. The flame is one of nine Atash Behrams (Fire of Victory), the highest grade of a fire held within a Zoroastrian fire temple. The fires are created from 16 “types” of fire. This particular flame is the only one located outside India. This fire has burned since 470, during the reign of the Sasanian Empire. The flame first flickered in the Pars Karyan fire temple, and was then relocated to the city of Aqda, where it burned for 700 years. The fire continued to move around over the years before finally landing in its current home in 1934. Today, the sacred flame burns within a bronze vessel and is protected by a glass wall. It’s kept alive by a person called a Hirob, who feeds the flame dry wood several times a day. Next to the temple, you’ll also find a fruit garden, a photo gallery, and a water basement connected to qanats, underground aqueducts supplying drinking water.

In the middle of nowhere, surrounded by only a few sheep, a new playground, toilet, and sand—lots of sand—lies this garden of stone trees. Hundreds of tall dry trees stretch across the sand, each with stones small and large—some weighing over 20 pounds—hanging from the branches. It’s a manmade heaven for weird-seekers. It also looks incredible. There’s also a remarkable story behind the garden. It was created by a hearing-impaired and mute landowner named Darvish Khan Esfandiyarpour. Starting in 1961, he hung each of the stones from thick wires and large ropes on the dying limbs. It was a silent protest against the land reform plans implemented by the Mohammad Reza Shah (Pahlavi) regime that caused the man to lose part of his land, including his real garden. The garden took on a new meaning over the years, with a new tree added for each significant event in the man’s life. Darvish Khan Esfandiyarpour passed away in 2007 at the age of 90, and was buried in his rocky garden. Although he is no longer there to tell the story behind his symbolic stones, the sight is still worth the trip. Only around 6,000 people visit the site each year, so chances are good you’ll be by yourself—accompanied by just the stones and sheep.

The 14th-century writer is considered the Shakespeare of Iran, one of the greatest Persian poets of all time, and a source of national pride. Hafez’s collected works, the Divān, is regarded as a pinnacle of Persian literature. Most every home in the country contains this book, and it is regularly read and consulted for guidance and inspiration. The poet is revered as a folk hero to this day, and people congregate at his tomb, especially at sunset, to pay their respects. Located in his home city of Shiraz, Hafez’s tomb lies in the Musalla Gardens, inside an open pavilion encircled by eight columns, topped with a mosaic tiled dome that glows beautifully when lit at night. The current pavilion and surrounding memorial structures were created in 1935, expanding on the original memorial built in 1773. The marble tomb is engraved with one of the poet’s verses, including these lines: On the day of my death, give me a minute’s time to set eyes on thee, Then, from the world and life, I will be set free. Hafez was born Khwaja Shams-ud-Dīn Muhammad Hafez-e Shirazi between 1317 and 1326, and died in 1389. He was a gifted and prolific poet and religious scholar whose unique style was often influenced by verses from the Quran, which he had completely memorized as a child. Hence his pen name became Hafez, meaning “guardian.” The poems he wrote have a musical lyricism and easy spontaneity that express the spiritual experiences of a mystic in love with the Beloved. Considered the master of the Persian ghazal (a type of romantic verse), his work was an immense contribution to Persian literature and culture.

Cyrus the Great was a ruler during the 4th century BCE who created the first Persian empire, welcoming in anyone from the civilized ancient Near East, including sects of Judaism. His reign lasted only 30 years, but by the time his string of conquered territories was finished, he had created the largest empire the world had ever seen to that point. He is also noted as having created the first writings regarding human rights. The Tomb of Cyrus in Iran was first rediscovered by Alexander the Great during his campaign across the Middle East. When Alexander arrived at the site it was said to have contained a golden bed, coffin, dinner setting, and a number of bejeweled items. There was also reportedly an inscription saying that it was in fact Cyrus who was buried at the site, although this evidence has never been found or verified. Despite the lack of evidence to verify that Cyrus is buried in the tomb, it is largely believed to be the case. The burial building sits atop a series of stacked platforms that, the original builders intended it or not (unlikely), is now considered to be the world’s first base-isolated building protected from earthquakes. Base isolating is a form of seismic protection that allows the main structures of buildings to move independent of their foundations, allowing for more give in the case of an earthquake.

Built in the 7th century, during the Sassanid Dynasty, the magnificent fortress was used to store grains and food, but also to safeguard valuables like gold and jewels when the city was under assault. The ancient bank is still in good condition and well worth the drive from Yazd. The main exterior walls and towers are intact, surrounded by a moat, and the interior is filled with 450 chambers over three floors. You can explore the maze-like interior for hours, though it will take some agility and fitness! Sar Yazd Castle was built to make it difficult to enter and navigate. Small openings made it almost impossible for intruders to enter, and narrow passages allow only one person to pass at a time. To be able to find all the hidden entrances and chambers, you really need a guide. But if you can make it to the top of the tallest tower, you will be rewarded with a stunning view of the surrounding desert and mountains, including Shirkuh, the highest peak in central Iran. The castle was also built to be impregnable with nested concentric walls, high towers, and a 20-foot-wide moat. It was a mighty citadel in its day, and lives on as a stunning architectural and historical treasure that provides a peek into the customs and culture of 7th century Iran.

33,Salt Men of Iran,"Zanjān, Iran",Salt cured mummies continue to turn up in this Iranian mine.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salt-men-iran,"While bulldozing salt from the Chehrabad Salt Mine, Iranian miners recently uncovered the sixth “salt man” to be found in the last fifteen years. These “salt men” are in fact ancient corpses killed or crushed in the cave and mummified by the extreme conditions. Hair, flesh and bone are all preserved by the dry salinity of the cave, and even internal organs such as stomachs and colons have been found intact. The first salt mummy, dated to 300 A.D., was discovered in 1993, sporting a long white beard, iron knives and a single gold earring. In 2004 another mummy was discovered only 50 feet away, followed by another in 2005 and a “teenage” boy mummy later that year. The oldest of the salt men found is truly ancient and has been carbon dated to 9550 B.C. Stanford University’s folklorist Adrienne Mayor thinks there may be another layer to the already intriguing story of the salt men. She thinks the mummies may be the origin of the ancient myth of the satyr. “Obviously satyrs are mythic creatures,” Mayor said, but pointed out that the heads of the humans who had been preserved in the salt bear “a striking resemblance to ancient Greek and Roman depictions of satyrs.” Classical images of satyrs are indeed similar looking, with similar hair and beards, snub noses and protruding jaws. “I think it’s very likely that an ancient discovery of a similarly preserved ‘salt man’ in northwestern Iran is the basis for St. Jerome’s account of the ‘satyr’ preserved in salt and examined by the Emperor Constantine and numerous other curious visitors in Antioch,” Mayor writes. While four salt men have been transferred to the Zanjan Archaeology Museum and one to the National Museum of Iran in Tehran (all can be seen by the public), the final salt man remains in-situ, half stuck in a mountain of salt. As of 2008, Iran’s Ministry of Industries and Mines canceled the mining permit for the Chehrabad Salt Mine and declared the site an archeological research center so more work could be done to look for and preserve other salt men. With the recent unrest in Iran, the fate of the salt men remains uncertain.",wonders of salt mummies caves ecosystems

Their rounded shapes and rugged outsides make it look as though they’re all melting into the earth. The minaret towering above the mosque vibrates randomly, its slight shakes creating the illusion the architecture is somehow alive. People have lived within the area where the abandoned village of Kharānaq stands for at least 4,000 years. Inevitably, buildings were constructed, modified, renovated, destroyed, and eventually built over. Sizable and diminutive buildings pile up side by side to form narrow alleyways. A random stroll through these passages will likely lead to the mosque and the caravanserai. A spiral staircase climbs to the top of the minaret, but the vibrations can make the experience quite unnerving. The caravanserai and the structure has also been renovated. As Kharanaq is perched on the slope of a steep hill, there are several vintage points that allow you to appreciate the beauty of the village and surrounding farming land. Not far from the village is an ancient bridge that farmers still use today. The buildings are at different stages of decay and collapse. It is, therefore, paramount that caution be taken when walking through the alleys. Entering the buildings is a serious hazard, and higher floors and rooftops are likely to fall through under the weight of an average person. A trickle of tourists has been pouring in, but Kharānaq still largely remains off the beaten path. As there are no facilities or information for tourists, a guide is handy but not necessary.

But the still inhabited cave dwellings help. The staggering age of the settlement at Maymand was determined by fragments of stone etchings that established the existence of human settlers. However the defining characteristic of the village, namely its 300+ in-ground cave homes are not nearly so old, only dating back 3-4,000 years. It is thought that the cave dwellings began as religious sites, but slowly evolved into permanent houses as settlers stayed on the spot longer and longer. As the locals tell it, their ancestors carved out the simple cave homes using a type of hard, sharpened stone that can be found in the area as opposed to traditional tools. The single room dwellings are stacked atop one another four and five tall sometimes, yet each of the barren caves has room for its own stove area. Miraculously for such an ancient and stark settlement, the array of caves that make up the village are still inhabited today. Some of the homes are thought to have been continually inhabited since their creation thousands of years earlier. The population as of 2006 numbered 673, but tends to fluctuate with the seasons. The caves may have a sort of barren beauty, but they are not exactly luxury accommodations.

36,Dolat Abad Windcatcher,"Yazd, Iran","Long before air conditioning, Persian architects found an ingenious way to cool off.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dolat-abad-windcatcher,"Iran has an extreme and arid climate. It can get very hot in the daytime and cool down considerably at night. Long before electricity and air conditioning were invented, back when Iran was called Persia, staying cool in these conditions required ingenuity; that’s how windcatchers were born. Windcatchers are a traditional Persian architectural design that creates natural ventilation in buildings. The basic design consists of a tower that rises from a building below, with openings at the top. Yazd, one of the largest cities in Iran, is known as the “City of Windcatchers.” It has a very hot and dry climate, perfect for this type of cooling device. Many old buildings in Yazd were built with magnificent windcatchers. The tower of Dolat Abad is the tallest existing windcatcher in Iran. It rises from a building in the 18th-century Dolat Abad Garden, a jewel of the city. Yazd is also known for having a large network of qanats, which are underground channels that transfer water from a well to the surface. The windcatchers and qanats often worked together to create an amplified cooling effect. Windcatchers work in one of three ways. The most common way is to cool the inside of a building. The tower has openings that face the wind and “catch” it, creating airflow inside the structure. When used in combination with a qanat, air is drawn down into the qanat tunnel and comes in contact with the cooler earth and cold water. The cooled air is drawn up through the windcatcher, which faces away from the prevailing wind—not only creating airflow, but also cooling the air. In a windless environment, windcatchers operate like a solar chimney, allowing hot air, which is lighter, to flow upwards and escape out the top of the tower.

37,Tomb of Daniel,"Shush, Iran",Burial site of a Jewish prophet revered in Iran.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-daniel,"There are many places that claim to be the traditional burial place of the biblical prophet Daniel, a Jewish prophet revered in Iran. But the tomb located in Susa, Iran, is the most widely accepted and the first that was mentioned by Benjamin of Tudela, a medieval Jewish traveler whose journeys preceded Marco Polo’s by about 100 years, who first visited Asia between 1160 and 1163. Is it the place, though? We may never know. The Book of Daniel says that the prophet lived in Babylon at one point and may have visited what is now Susa, Iran, but the place of his death is not clearly specified in the text. But people may not need to know. Today, the Tomb of Daniel in Susa is a popular tourist attraction, largely among local Muslims and Iran’s Jewish community. An account given by 10th-century Arab chronicler Ibn Hawqai is another argument for the tomb’s current location: “In the city of Susa there is a river and I have heard that in the time of Abu Mousa Al Ashoari a coffin was found there; it is said to contain the bones of Daniel the Prophet. The people held it in great veneration and in times of distress, famine or droughts brought it out and prayed for rain. Abu Mousa Al Ashoari ordered that the coffin be encased with three coverings and submerged it in the river so that it could not be viewed. The grave can be seen by anyone who dives to the bottom of the water.” Visitors are able to walk through the remains of the ancient palace that stands over the Tomb of Daniel. The conical building shown in the pictures above is where the mausoleum of Daniel stands.",cultures and civilizations memento mori catacombs and crypts architectural oddities architecture
38,Eram Garden,"Shiraz, Iran","Named after a legendary garden called Eram in southern Arabia, built by order of Shaddad, an Arab king who wanted to compete with Paradise.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eram-garden,"Eram Garden (Bagh-e Eram), located along the northern shore of the Khoshk River in Shiraz, is one of the most famous and beautiful Persian gardens in all of Iran. It should be noted that the word ‘Eram’ is the Persian version of the Arabic word ‘Iram’ which means heaven in Islam’s most holiest of books, the Qur’an. With its beautiful grounds, lush plant life and aesthetic attractions, it’s easy to see why Eram evokes such a description. With their beautiful flowers, refreshing air, aromatic myrtles and towering cypress trees, including one tree which is said to date back to 3000 years ago (Sarv-e naz), the Eram Gardens are a major tourist destination, especially during the spring. Although no one is quite sure when construction of the gardens began, historical evidence suggests that the gardens were built during the Seljuk Dynasty (11th-14th centuries) under the rule of one of its most celebrated monarchs, Ahmad Sanjar. Like many other attractions in Shiraz, the Eram Gardens have been restored and repaired by the Zand kings of the Zand Dynasty (1750-1794), but during the later period of the Zand Dynasty, the garden changed hands to a Qashgai tribal chief, Mohammad Qoli Khan. Mohammad Qoli Khan ordered the construction of the original mansion that stood on the grounds in the early 18th century, and planted various trees and plants in the garden including pine, orange, cypress and persimmon trees. Later on, during the rule of King Nasser ed-din of the Qajar Dynasty (1785-1925) Mirza Hassan Ali Khan Nasir-al Mulk bought the gardens from the Qashgai tribes and began construction on the present pavilion that now stands in the gardens. As noteworthy as the gardens themselves, the pavilion was constructed by a local Shirazi architect, one Mohammad Hassan. The beautiful three-story structure was constructed based on the Safavid and Qajar styles of architecture, and includes tiles inscribed with poems from the famed Persian poet Hafez.",horticulture cultures and civilizations natural history plants architectural oddities architecture
39,Lake Urmia,"East Azerbaijan Province, Iran",This lake in northwest Iran has started turning from green to red more frequently than scientists are comfortable with.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-urmia,"In the summer of 2016, the water of Iran’s Lake Urmia dramatically changed color from green to red. It was not a new phenomenon, but it has become more frequent in recent years, and is not the only disturbing trend that the lake is experiencing. Lake Urmia is located between East and West Azerbaijan Provinces in northwest Iran and is home to 120 islands. Though it was once the largest lake in the Middle East and the sixth-largest salt water lake in the world, at 5,000 square kilometers, it is estimated that the lake’s surface area has shrunk by 90% since the 1970s, much of that within the last two decades. This is mostly due to human activity, with dams and illegal wells impeding the flow of water from the 60 surrounding rivers and streams that feed the lake. These and other developments have caused the salinity of the water to rise significantly, which affects wildlife of all sizes. Migratory birds like flamingos, pelicans, ducks, and egrets no longer frequent the lake, which cannot sustain fish anymore. Even the lake’s native species of brine shrimp, Artemia, which can survive at very high salinity levels, are rumored to have gone extinct. The organisms that are thriving are the reason the water turns red. The algae that grows in the lake, Dunaliella salina, would normally appear green, but with less water in the lake and more exposure to sunlight, the algae produces carotenoids in its cells to absorb the excess light, which makes it appear red. It is also thought that a salt-loving bacteria called Halobacteriaceae, which has a red pigment to absorb sunlight for energy, is involved. Water loss also exposes the lake’s salt, which visitors to the lake like to cover themselves with, but which also gets kicked up by windstorms, causing injury to people and to crops. The lake, named following the Iranian Revolution for the provincial capital city of Urmia, which means “puddle of water,” shows signs of recovery. The Iranian government along with international organizations like UNESCO and WHO have made efforts to rein in illegal wells and improve the irrigation techniques of surrounding farms. Seasonal rains in the later months of the year provide some relief to the lake, but are not a permanent solution.",iran color lakes water
40,Khaju Bridge,"Isfahan, Iran",This 17th-century structure is a beautiful testimony to traditional Persian architecture,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khaju-bridge,"It’s easy to see why this centuries-old structure was deemed Isfahan’s finest bridge. During the day, sunlight bathes its tiled facade. After dusk, lights illuminate its arches, filling the caverns with a warm, fiery glow. Zayandehrud River, starting in the Zagros Mountains, flows nearly 250 miles across the Iranian Plateau before ending in the Gavkhouni swamps. Humans have lived along its banks for thousands of years, with the earliest evidence of their settlements dating back to the sixth millennium. One of these settlements prospered and eventually became Isfahan. Isfahan’s fortunes changed dramatically many times along its tumultuous history. Renowned explorer and scholar Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1327 and described it as “the largest and fairest of cities, but it is now in ruins,” hinting at its former glory. However, three centuries later, Isfahan began rising again, in what can aptly be described as the city’s golden age, when Shah Abbas I (who reigned from 1588 to 1629) made it the capital city of the empire and Shah Abbas II (who reigned from 1642 to 1666) oversaw its rebuilding. This was a time when Isfahan became one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the world. As Persian culture was flourishing, so was its architecture. Among the many outstanding accomplishments of this era is Khaju Bridge, which connects the Khaju and Takhte Foolad quarters across the Zayanderud River. The exact date of Khaju Bridge’s completion is not recorded, but it’s known that it was built on top of an older bridge around 1650. The structure consists of 23 stone arches. It’s about 430 feet long and nearly 40 feet wide, and it functions as both a bridge and a weir. The sluice gates built under the archways are still used to these days to regulate the flow of the Zayanderud River for irrigation. The upper part of Khaju Bridge consists of a large central aisle originally designed for horse-drawn carts flanked on either side by a pedestrian sidewalk. The ingenious interplay of vaults and inlets provides an intricate pattern through which air cools down, providing pedestrians with pleasant temperatures even during the hottest months of the year. Halfway through the bridge is a split pavilion, half looking upstream, and half looking downstream. It’s recorded that Shah Abbas II once sat in the pavilion to admire the beauty of the river snaking through the city. You can still see original geometric tilework and paintings along Khaju Bridge, which is now used mainly as a place for relaxing and socializing.  Khaju Bridge is located in the historical centre of Isfahan, connecting Khajoo Square in the north and Feyz Boulevard in the south.",engineering infrastructure bridges architecture
41,Ebrat Museum,"Tehran, Iran",This circular Iranian jail was once a political prison run by the country's secret police.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ebrat-museum,"Like many converted secret police museums around the world, the Ebrat Museum in Tehran, Iran was once the site of countless illegal incarcerations, or worse, yet today it stands as a museum devoted to remembering the bad times. At least some of them. The prison building itself is a striking edifice with detention wings attached to a circular inner courtyard that reaches up to skylight as a barred drum. In the 1970s, the prison was a dreaded jail run by the then-Shah’s secret police, known as the SAVAK (“Sāzemān-e Ettelā’āt va Amniyat-e Keshvar” or Organization of Intelligence and National Security). The prison was originally the headquarters of section of the secret police that went by the bureaucratically innocuous handle of the “Anti-Vandalism Joint Committee.” Under their control, hundreds of political prisoners were detained in the prison and many were tortured. In 1979, with the Islamic Revolution, the jail was renamed the Towhid Prison, and continued to operate until it was shut down in 2000 after a human rights investigation. Today the site has been reopened as the Ebrat Museum, and features displays and dioramas that recall the atrocoties that took place at the site under the Shah. Mannequins are staged in the small cells with bloody smears as evidence of the torture they endured and thuggish fake henchmen lord over the inmates. The museum notably cites all of the worse abuses under the Shah’s regime, with little to no coverage of the prison’s conditions during its 20 years under the Islamic Republic.

42,Khalid Nabi Cemetery,Iran,Iranian tombstones shaped like male and female sexual organs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khalid-nabi-cemetery,"In the stunning green hills of Northern Iran, one cemetery is covered in headstones distinctly resembling male and female genitalia. Some are cylindrical and capped, while others are paired and rounded. All told, the cemetery has a total of 600 monuments to sex organs sprawling across the vibrant landscape. In a country known for its strict religious law, a cemetery dotted with varying-sized penis and breast shaped headstones tends to stand out. Visitors can immediately tell that the cemetery was created in a far different era. Close to the border with Turkmenistan, some experts suggest that the cemetery was created by phallus worshipping peoples from Central Asia and India, although conclusive proof of this does not exist. Little scholarship has occurred on the cemetery’s origins within Iran because of a strong national embarrassment over the suggestive stones. There is little publicity over the cemetery and most scholars have strayed from studying the historic area. Besides being home to hundreds of penis tombstones, a famous Christian prophet from Yemen who died in the 4th century is also buried near the cemetery. Despite its proximity to the genitalia cemetery, the prophet is in fact buried in a classic tomb, and is actually a pilgrimage site for many Turkmen who place ribbons on his shrine. The combination of pilgrims and curious tourists make for an odd mix of playful and pious visitors to Khalid Nabi.

Two fierce dragons guard the rock, and they’re unique architectural additions within this part of Asia. The Mongol king Öljaitü had the Dashkasan Dragon Temple constructed in the early 14th century. Three caves were quarried into the mountain to create the sacred space. Four Chinese craftsmen built the rectangular temple and carved the striking dragon sculptures that sprawl across both sides. The dragons, which stretch to nearly 10 feet (three meters) in height, are surrounded by more traditional Islamic designs such as flowers. A mihrab, a niche in the wall that marks the direction of Mecca, was also added within the temple. Some researchers believe this temple was initially used by the Zora-Astrian followers of Mithras (God of Light and Truth) in the Sassanid period (224 to 651). Today, excavations of the temple remain half finished. Columns and debris have been moved to the area outside of the temple.

Bands of red, white, yellow, grey, orange, and other pastel hues tint the rocky landscape. Located outside the city of Tabriz in the northwestern part of Iran, the Aladaglar Mountains are an otherworldly site. Like other painted mountains, such as those found in China’s Zhangye National Geopark or Peru’s Ausangate Mountains, these colorful stripes are said to be the result of minerals and sandstone being pressed together and oxidized over millions of years. In the Azeri Turkish, the local language in Tabriz, “ala” means colorful and ”dag” means mountain (There is a mountain range called Aladaglar in Turkey as well, but it does not feature the same colorful geological formations). These mountains are one of Iran’s several naturally colorful sites, including the terraces at Badab-e Surt, the landscapes of Hormuz Island, and the waters of Lake Urmia.

46,Graffiti at Persepolis,Iran,Marked by the hand of the explorer Henry Morton Stanley.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grafitti-at-persepolis,"The summer before Henry Morton Stanley made his name as the discoverer of David Livingstone in Africa, the 29 year old Special Correspondent to the New York Herald took time out of his busy itinerary to carve his name into the historic monuments at Persepolis. In the summer of 1870, the paper had sent him on a tour of Crimea, Persia, and India following his coverage of the opening of the Suez Canal. Stanley arrived at the remains of the great city decades before it was excavated. Even so, he described the enormity of some of the exposed ruins he encountered: “Three monolithic jambs standing upright are what remain of what was once a monster double pylon. It is fifty feet in depth, the stones of which are so Cyclopean in size that one is immediately reminded of the great stones of Egypt, and the temple stones of Jerusalem. One of these blocks, which flanked the open portal, measured 17 feet 2 inches in length by four feet in height; the largest measures 21 feet 4 inches in length and 6 feet in height. The breadth of the portal is about 20 feet.” Stanley was looking at what was once the lavish center the ancient Achaemenid Empire, founded in or around 518 BC by the emperor Darius I. Built on a natural terrace, the sprawling capitol was built on a monumental scale, filled with sculpted reliefs. Persepolis’ downfall came when it was famously sacked by Alexander the Great in 330-331 BC. He and his men looted the treasury and allegedly burned the palace to the ground in an act of drunken destruction. The ruins were well known but the extent of the complex was not understood until excavations at the site finally began in the 1930s under the guidance of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. For eight years German and American researchers excavated the area around Persepolis as well as other ancient sites in Persia (now Iran), a project notable for being among the first archaeological project to make use of extensive aerial photography. Several major museums including the British Museum in London, the Oriental Institute in Chicago, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York hold significant sculptures and artifacts from Persepolis. Over the years, many travelers left their mark on the ruins in the form of graffiti, including of course Henry Morton Stanley. The city is now a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site and graffiti quite illegal. Most travelers depart from Shiraz to Persepolis, about 70 miles away",dead explorers ruins

He moved them into the heart of Persia (now Iran), hoping to harness their entrepreneurial and artisanal skills for his empire. In the same year, an edict of the shah established New Julfa, on what was then the outskirts of Isfahan. The construction of Vank Cathedral began immediately after. The building’s structure combines traditional Armenian architectural styles with the region’s Islamic architecture. The resulting church has rich frescoes and tile work, as do some of the other Armenian churches in New Julfa. Vank Cathedral also has a library and museum, which includes an Armenian book that was the first book ever printed in Iran, as well as edicts by Abbas I and other shahs forbidding interference with or persecution of the Armenians.

48,Iran Mall,"Tehran, Iran",One of the world's largest shopping malls covers an area of 15 million square feet—and it's still set to grow.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iran-mall,"The Iran Mall is a vast shopping and entertainment complex in northwest Tehran. The first phase of the mall opened in 2018, at which point the mall became the largest in the world. And with the second phase still in progress, the Iran Mall will only continue to grow. Prior to the construction of the Iran Mall, the largest shopping mall in the world was the South China Mall in Dongguan, China. With a gross leasable area (GLA) of 7.1 million square feet, it was‚—and still is—a real whopper of a mall. But when the first stage of the Iran Mall was opened in 2018, it more than doubled the GLA of the South China Mall, becoming the uncontested king of commercial complexes. With a total area of 15 million square feet, the Iran Mall is about five times larger than the King of Prussia mall in Pennsylvania, currently the largest mall in the United States. Or, to use a non-mall comparison, the Iran Mall covers more than twice the area of the Pentagon. So what exactly is going on at the Iran Mall to justify such a vast space? Well, in terms of zoning, 24 percent of the mall is occupied by commercial spaces, 18 percent is allocated to cultural facilities, 31 percent to public and recreational areas, 19 percent to parking, and 5 percent for the hotel. The first phase of the mall is home to a range of retail outlets that will have even the most world-weary of shopaholics drooling. Not all of the shops are open yet, but there is currently room for around 700 stores (set to expand to 1,000), selling everything from international designer brands to traditional Iranian-made products, and a 215,000-square-feet hypermarket. You’ll also find a vast car showroom. For the style-conscious, meanwhile, there’s a fashion avenue, a diamond atrium, and a crystal atrium. And for the more cerebral shopper, there’s a book garden with several bookstores containing around 67,000 volumes, as well as an on-site museum, art galleries, and a state-of-the-art 2,000-seat theater. Beyond the shopping, there’s also a cinema complex with 12 IMAX cinemas, an amusement park, a hotel, a conference hall, and a convention center. And to introduce a bit of healthiness into the mall, there’s a sports complex with cycling and hiking routes, numerous sports fields, swimming pools, tennis courts, and a large ice rink. If all this sounds like a commercialized nightmare of Dawn of the Dead proportions, visitors can always run and hide in the Bagh-Didar, or Meeting Garden. Based on the Mahan Garden, a historical Persian garden in Iran, the Bagh-Didar is a cool green space located right in the heart of the mall, where people can escape from the incessant shopping. As for phase two of the Iran Mall, that’s supposed to be completed in 2020. And once that’s finished, it will cover a total area of 20 million square feet. Which just sounds exhausting.

Nicknamed the “Greek Ship,” the rusting husk is actually the remains of a cargo ship formerly known as the Khoula F. The ship was originally built in Scotland in 1943, and known as the Empire Trumpet. She sailed all over the world during her operating life, changing hands and names on a regular basis. Her final owners, who were in possession of the craft when it was finally grounded in 1966, were Greek, which is how the ship eventually got the common name that it is known by today. In 1966, the Khoula F ran aground and, despite efforts to drag her back out to sea, she was forever stuck in place. Ironically, she was on her way to Greece when she ran aground. According to legend, the owners set the ship on fire when they abandoned it, assumedly as a cheap form of ship-breaking. It is hard to tell whether this is true today as time and rust have taken their toll on the haunting hulk. Portions of the ship are falling apart, and the whole thing is a rusting wreck.

It is dedicated to Fatemeh Maasoume, an ancient noblewoman who was a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammad. Fatemeh Maasoume was born in Medina in 790 and died in Qom 26 years later. In a way, the moment she was born, Fatemeh was already at the center of a daunting prophecy. Fatemeh (her name in Arabic is “Fātimah bint Mūsā al-Kādhim,” and there are a bewildering number of spelling variations of both versions) was the daughter of Musa al-Kadhim, the seventh Imam, and sister of Imam Reza, the eighth Imam. Ja’far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam, is said to have predicted that “A lady from my children whose name will be Fatima, daughter of Mūsā, will die in Qum. On the Day of Judgement this lady will intercede for all my Shi’a to enter Heaven.” Fatemeh was one of Musa al-Kadhim’s 37 children, but she had an especially close relationship with her brother Ali (later to become Imam Reza). In 815, due to a difficult political impasse, Imam Reza was coaxed to travel to Marw to become Crown Prince of Khorasan (a state that comprised of northeast Iran, part of Afghanistan, and part of Turkmenistan). Fatemeh stayed put in Medina, but after one year apart, she decided to join him. Unfortunately, the caravan she was traveling with was attacked by an Abbasid contingent. Fatemeh was taken prisoner and poisoned shortly afterward. As her health deteriorated, she requested to be taken to Qom, where she died. Fatemeh’s noble lineage would have sufficed to make her a saint, but she is now mostly remembered and respected as a learned scholar of the sciences, and for her knowledge of Islamic tradition and her pious life. After her death, the Fatemeh Maasoume Shrine soon became a prime destination for Shi’a Muslims wishing to honor her. Later imams claimed that visiting the shrine would ensure access to heaven, and several miracles have been reported to take place at the shrine. Fatemeh Maasoume Shrine is first and foremost a pilgrimage site, and as such, it attracts throngs of devout Muslims. It is not uncommon to witness people sobbing profusely upon hearing a particularly moving religious passage, people inflicting physical punishment on themselves, or people collapsing of exhaustion under the weight of elaborate banners adorned with symbolic effigies. The complex where the shrine is located consists of a large open court where pilgrims and visitors congregate.  Along the perimeter of the court are several beautifully adorned mosques and tomb chambers of eminent religious figures, but the centerpiece is the actual shrine, with its golden dome, colorful minarets, and intricate patterns decorating its vaults.  Fatemeh Maasoume Shrine sits at the heart of Qom, by the main square. Independent non-Muslims visitors are not always welcome on site, but group visits are organized on a daily basis. Dress very conservatively and try being inconspicuous if you take pictures. This is not a touristy place; it’s a place of worship that awakens deep religious feelings in devotees.",miracles islam shrines saints ancient religion sacred spaces

According to scripture, Esther was a beautiful Jewish girl who was chosen to be the wife of king Xerxes I in Persia. She lived in Iran with her cousin and guardian Mordechai. Mordechai offended the king’s chief adviser Haman, who then resolved to kill all Jews in Persian empire as revenge. Queen Esther was able to foil this plan, saving the Jews and leading to the end of the adviser Haman’s life instead. Mordechai was positioned as a king’s adviser after that. Both Esther and Mordechai obtained a status as prophets in the history of Jewish people. Their final resting place in Hamedan is a special place of worship and has been maintained in a good condition. Over the years, the building has been restored and repainted several times. However the eagerness and efforts of restaurators has changed many of the interior description notes on the walls. These have been written in Hebrew originally but after many overpaintings, the writings have changed so considerably that by now the text does not make much sense. The main architect, Elias Gabbay who devised the works has later noticed that many of the ancient characters of the complex have retained their appearance.

The view of the desert from Chak Chak is impressive—mysterious and ominous when visibility is low, and breath-taking and exhilarating when the air is clear of dust—and the view reveals how remote this location truly is. Pir-e-Sabz Fire Temple consists of a man-made cavern with two large bronze doors at the entrance. The walls of the temple have been blackened by the fire that is kept burning in the temple at all times, as Zoroastrian tradition prescribes. On the walls is a panoply of Zoroastrian iconography, including portraits of Ahura Mazda, the highest deity of Zoroastrianism, and spear-clenching guardians similar to those found in Persepolis. In the center of the cavern, an intricate set of metal trays in the shape of a flower offers different types of incense to be burnt in honor of Ahura Mazda. As mentioned above, Pir-e-Sabz Fire Temple is considered sacred by Zoroastrians. This is due to the legend that the Arab forces cornered Nikbanou, daughter of King Yazdegerd III, in this unforgiving corner of Persia. Nikbanou prayed to Ahura Mazda, and in response he created the cavern in which the temple is now located, providing sustenance in the form of tears that he shed upon witnessing Nikbanou’s predicament. Ahura Mazda’s tears took the form of a year-round dripping spring inside the temple. Every year, from June 14–18, Zoroastrians from near and far gather at Pir-e-Sabz Fire Temple to pray and honor Ahura Mazda and Nikbanou. During this time, the temple is off limits for visitors.  The easiest way to visit Pir-e-Sabz is by organizing a trip from Yadz, which is about 100 km from Chak Chak.",zoroastrianism fire temples sacred spaces
56,Babylon,"Hillah, Iraq","Celebrated as a center of civilization, the remains of the ancient city have been nearly destroyed by greed, egoism, and war.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/babylon,"After colonial looting, the narcissistic dreams of a dictator, and the heavy mark of war, the legendary city of Babylon has almost vanished. The ancient city was the capital of the Mesopotamian dynasties. Its final glory was as capital of the kingdom of Babylonia under King Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled from 605 to 563 BCE. During his reign, most of the buildings represented by the surviving ruins were constructed, including two grand palaces. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, built by Nebuchadnezzar for his wife Amytas, are remembered as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. He also expanded his territory by forcing thousands to relocate, starting the first exile in Jewish history. Babylon’s remains, mounds of mud-brick buildings spread over about 30 square kilometers, are in present-day Iraq, south of Baghdad. Starting in 1983, Saddam Hussein, imagining himself as heir to Nebuchadnezzar, ordered the rebuilding of Babylon. Like Nebuchadnezzar, Hussein had his name inscribed on the bricks, which were placed directly on top of the ruins, some 2,500 years old. A sample inscription translates to: ”In the reign of the victorious Saddam Hussein, the president of the Republic, may God keep him, the guardian of the great Iraq and the renovator of its renaissance and the builder of its great civilization, the rebuilding of the great city of Babylon was done in 1987.” Hussein also added huge portraits of himself and Nebuchadnezzar at the entrance of the ruins. As most Iraqi men were fighting the bloody Iran-Iraq war, he brought in thousands of Sudanese workers to lay new yellow bricks over the old mud construction where Nebuchadnezzar’s palace had stood. No one is sure what the palace looked like, but that didn’t stop Hussein’s garish and quick reincarnation of the old splendor. At the end of the Persian Gulf War, he commissioned a palace over more Babylonian ruins, in the same pyramid style as a Sumerian ziggurat, calling it Saddam Hill. The massive gaudy structure almost completely covered the original ruins, outraging archaeologists. Hussein’s plans for a cable line running over the Babylon site were halted with the 2003 invasion. Before Hussein’s reconstruction, there had already been destruction from the shifts in rivers and deserts, and still more from colonial powers. Germans took the Ishtar Gate, which is now in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, while the French took ceramics, and the Turks used Babylonian bricks to build dams on the Euphrates. The occupation of US forces also damaged the site. Following the 2003 invasion, the US camp Alpha was set up on the ruins. Areas were leveled to create landing pads for helicopters and parking lots for vehicles. Tanks rumbled over the ancient bricks, and Polish troops dug trenches through a temple. Soil holding artifacts and bones was scooped into sandbags. And even the military presence couldn’t keep out looters, who ransacked Iraq’s more than 10,000 historic sites after the invasion. But there is hope. With the end of his rule, Hussein’s ego-driven reconstruction of Babylon was stopped. In 2006, UN officials and Iraqi leaders stated their intentions to restore Babylon into a cultural center. It’s estimated that 95 percent of Babylon could be hidden in the unexcavated mounds at the site. In 2009, the ruins and Hussein’s palace were opened to tourists. While there is much enthusiasm for archaeological research and restoration of the site, the colossal disfigurement may take decades to reverse.",ruins

Known as the malwiya or the snail shell minaret, this 180 foot tower was the main focal point of the mosque, that covered 42 acres at its peak. In the mid-9th century, the great work was commissioned by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil who allegedly rode a white donkey up the spiraling paths to the top. Over time, the mosque was slowly destroyed and fell into disuse by the 11th century. However, it’s memory was always preserved in the malwiya minaret that towered over Samarra. The pillar was given something of a new life during the war in Iraq, as US troops used it for observation. Sadly, in 2005, the famous minaret was partially destroyed during a bombing raid by insurgents. After 1000 years of proudly standing in the medieval Abbasid capital, it finally began to crumble under the firepower of modern weaponry. Conflicting stories exist as to why the tower was attacked. Some claim the attack was directed against US forces, while others such as Tony Blair assert that the bombing was carried out to instigate secular warfare. If the latter is true, the lifespan of the minaret could be dramatically shortened given the uncertain and unstable political situation in Iraq.",outsider architecture sacred spaces ruins
58,Lalish Temple,"Al-Shikhan, Iraq",The sacred shrine of the Yazidis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lalish-temple,"Yazidism is a small monotheistic faith that shares similarities with other religions that originated in the Middle East—namely Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—as well as elements of Zoroastrianism and of the worship of nature. Most Yazidis live in the Nineveh province of Northern Iraq, and this is also where the Lalish temple is located, the most sacred site in the Yazidi faith. The village of Lalish dates back thousands of years, and it is believed the temple was first used by the ancient Sumerians and other early Mesopotamian civilizations. Most Yazidi followers make a pilgrimage to the small mountain village at least once in their lives. The conical-roofed shrine is believed to contain the tomb of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir, the religion’s chief saint. Today, the village is not inhabited; only the head figure in the Yazidi faith, the Emir, lives there. There are, however, a large number of houses in the ancient village, which are left unlocked and available to pilgrims. Yazidis believe in one God, who brought the world into being and then handed it over to the care of seven angels. The most important of the angels is Melek Taus, the “peacock angel,” who is venerated in the form of the beautiful-feathered bird. The symbol of a peacock is found throughout Lalish, as well as symbols of the shining Sun, representing the Light of God, and the black serpent, the origin of which is shrouded in mystery. Adherents of the Yazidi faith appeared on the global stage in 2014 when they began to be targeted by ISIL as a religious minority. The genocide caused many Yazidis to be forced to leave their ancestral lands in Northern Iraq.  Remember to take off your shoes before entering the village.

59,Erbil Citadel,"Erbil, Iraq",An ancient fortified mound raised over the millennia from settlements built one on top of the other.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erbil-citadel,"Settlements built on top of older settlements for 7,000 years have created a large elevated mound in the heart of the historical city of Erbil (also known as Hawler) in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. On top of the elevated ground, Erbil Citadel stands witness to the passing of time and history. Erbil Citadel is a fortified ovoid-shaped ancient mound. Seen from above, the mound of earth sprouts from the otherwise flat surrounding terrain. The elevation is due to millennia of settlements built one on top of the other. Dwellings were usually made of mud bricks, which in time disintegrated and contributed to heightening the overall ground of the citadel, which raised more than 100 feet over the centuries. The first recorded document that mentions the citadel is from 2300 B.C., but the most ancient traces date back to 5000 B.C.  Unsurprisingly, the citadel has undergone several phases of destruction and reconstruction. Although Kurdish and Assyrian people tended to inhabit the citadel, various waves of outsiders went through, including Sumerians, Mongols, Ottomans, and Europeans. In 2007, extensive international archaeological excavations began. In 2014, UNESCO welcomed the citadel among the list of World Heritage Sites. The area occupied by the Erbil Citadel is just over 10 hectares (1,410 x 1,120 feet), and it mainly consists of a main thoroughfare in the middle and a dense set of criss-crossing alleys. There are currently three entrances and hundreds of houses on the ancient mound. Of the surviving buildings, the oldest dates back to 1893, and the only religious building left is the Mullah Afandi Mosque. A fortified wall circumscribes some segments of the perimeter of the citadel, while other segments are marked by the contiguous facade of houses built on the edge of the mound.  These days, a statue of historian Mubarak Ben Ahmed Sharaf-Aldin guards the South gate. Caution is recommended when entering the buildings as some have been restored and seem reasonably safe, while others are on the verge of collapsing.",mounds mosques unesco forts ancient archaeology history
60,Bahdinan Gate,"Amedi, Iraq",This beautiful arched gate is all that remains of the fortress the ancient mountaintop town of Amadiya once was.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bahdinan-gate,"Amadiya, in Iraqi Kurdistan, is one of those cities whose history is so long it approaches the unbelievable. It is estimated that there was a stable settlement at this site thousands of years ago, part of the Assyrian Empire. It is also said to be the birthplace of the Three Wise Men, the Biblical Magi that made a pilgrimage to Bethlehem to bring presents to Jesus Christ upon his birth. Several centuries and empires later, Amadiya was conquered by the Arabs, and in the 7th century a pasha began to be the ruler of Amadiya (or Amedi in Kurdish). It wasn’t until centuries later, during the Bahdinan Emirate (1376-1843), that Amadiya became known as a place where Muslims, Christians, and Jews could live side by side in peace. It was also during this time that the Bahdinan Gate was built. Perched on the western slopes of Amadiya, the arched stone gate was once the only entryway into the fortified town. A large, winding stone staircase goes through the 13-foot-wide gate, which bears four carvings of people whose identity is unclear. Some historians think they could be Parthian kings from the 3rd century, suggesting this entrance had been in use for several centuries before the gate was built. The arch is adorned with an effigy of the sun, a recurring symbol in Kurdish architecture, enclosed by a cord with four knots, representing the geopolitical significance of the ancient city. The Bahdinan Gate is also called Sipna Gate, Mosul Gate, Western Gate or just the Old Gate.",fortresses ancient history architecture

But this holy book was written in blood—Saddam Hussein’s blood to be precise. Following an assassination attempt on the life of his son, Uday, the former dictator became a devout Muslim. Ironically though, with infinite resources it’s difficult to demonstrate your piety. In an attempted display of devotion, Saddam had roughly 27 liters of his blood drawn and given to a calligrapher over a period of two years. Over the course of two years the artist, Abbas Shakir Joudi al-Baghdadi, wrote some 600 pages of the Quran using the Iraqi president’s blood as ink. Authorities don’t know what to do with the document. On the one hand, it is a significant, if gruesome, artifact of a particular era in Iraqi history. On the other hand, displaying it could cause it to be glorified by Saddam’s supporters, the Ba’ath Party. Additionally, to mainstream Sunni Muslims, the macabre method of writing such a Quran “haraam,” or forbidden. For now, the Blood Quran resides in a basement under strict lock and key. It was previously on display in Saddam’s “Mother of All Battles” Mosque. Now, that room is sealed by three vaulted doors, the keys to which have been distributed between a sheikh, the city police commissioner, and a secret third party. In order to even be considered for a visit to the Blood Quran, one has to submit to deliberation by a government committee. So for now, it sits in the mosque, growing more curious and grisly by the day.",dictators islam books religion sacred spaces
62,The Tree of Knowledge,"Qurna, Iraq",A shrine on the shores of the Tigris.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tree-knowledge,"In the small southern Iraqi city of Qurna, an unusual shrine stands on the shore of the Tigris: a small, dead tree, protected by low brick walls and surrounded by a concrete plaza. This tree is, according to local legend, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, the one that Eve ate from in the Garden of Eden. Qurna (also spelled Qurnah, and pronounced “gurna”) has been noted in travelers’ accounts for centuries as the place where the great Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet and join together for a few miles before emptying into the Persian Gulf. The Tigris and Euphrates are two of the four “rivers of paradise” that flowed out of the Garden of Eden, as named in Genesis 2:10-14. Elements from the early stories of Genesis have been traced to the cuneiform tablets written by the Sumerians and Babylonians, who lived in this part of the world. It is clearly a deciduous tree, not a palm, but no one can say for sure which species it once was, or how long it has been there. British soldiers reportedly climbed and broke the Tree in post-World War I occupation; it was repaired with concrete. In the 1950s, a small park of local plants was built around the Tree as a gesture of goodwill after World War II. Under the early reign of Saddam Hussein, the shrine was preserved in a small concrete plaza, which has reportedly deteriorated in the wake of the 2003 American invasion. By then there were actually several Trees of Knowledge. Although the shrine is associated with the Garden of Eden story, which is shared among Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, it also retains aspects of much older, pre-monotheistic traditions of tree worship in the Middle East. When one sacred tree dies, you must plant another to preserve the sacredness, so often several trees are standing in different stages of decay. People travel from other parts of the country to pray at the Tree, sometimes tying small green pieces of cloth around its branches as a token.",garden of eden world's oldest trees biblical horticulture shrines trees plants sacred spaces

Unlikely.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qyzqapan-tomb,"In a remote valley in Iraqi Kurdistan lies an ancient tomb carved into a rocky cliff, decorated with Hellenistic carvings and columns befitting a king and Zoroastrian symbols dating back to early human civilization. Many sources claim the archaeological site of Qizqapan is the tomb of Cyaxares, the great king of the Median empire who saw to the end of Assyrian hegemony, ushering in a Median age (only to then be supplanted by the Persians themselves). It may seem strange that this burial place in Iraqi Kurdistan should be that of a Median king, and indeed it is unlikely. Whose tomb was it? We’ll never know. It was looted in antiquity and is now graffitied by locals. Nevertheless, it cannot be doubted that this really was a monumental piece of architecture, not too dissimilar to the more lavish examples of rock tombs around Persepolis in the East, or the plainer ones in the Urartu citadel at Van to the north.  Above the main door is an impressive relief. A religious scene, we see a high-status individual standing beside a fire altar, hand raised in prayer.  On the other side, another individual appears to be involved in the ceremony. The tomb has three burial chambers, each with a hewn grave in the left corners, all accessible from the central chamber.

The rest of the country is often lost in the scramble and written off, which keeps the rest of the world from a 5,000-year-old culture that includes the majestic Mudhif houses of the Marsh Arabs of Southern Iraq. With a population just under 500,000, it is understandable that the Madan people, also called Marsh Arabs, often get lost in the fracas. However, a glance into their world reveals a type of architecture that is unique and awe-inspiring. Mudhif houses are slightly curved communal spaces constructed out of reeds and adobe. They are typically maintained by the village sheikh through a taxation system. Mudhif houses act as the main center of society for the Madan. Visitors are hosted in the house, and religious and cultural life are also centered there. Today, a rebirth of the ancient Mudhif style has been spurred by the United States Army, who have worked with local populations to rebuild modern houses with a Madan twist. In an effort to aid refugees, many of these marsh homes have been constructed as housing projects to accommodate the deluge of people returning to Southern Iraq after being displaced by the war.",war eccentric homes homes military architectural oddities architecture

Now resembling little more than rubble, the ruins are the remains of an innovative aqueduct some speculate may have led to the world’s most famous lost ancient wonder. The Assyrian King Sennacherib built his mammoth hydraulics system to bring water from the mountains around Dohuk to his palaces within the city of Nineveh, which now lies beneath present-day Mosul, Iraq. His palace was uncovered after the shrine built atop it was destroyed by ISIS. This enormous aqueduct, which was built between 700 and 690 BC roughly 30 miles from the King’s gardens, predates the Roman engineering marvels that famously still survive in Europe today and is said to be the oldest in the world. It was built from more than two million stones and waterproof cement. It’s thought the hydraulics system fed into an early prototype of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon or perhaps into the legendary gardens themselves. King Sennacherib’s words still reach out to us today, more than 2,000 years later, through the inscriptions scrawled across the stones. The aqueduct and the suggestive relief panels found within his rediscovered palace lend credence to the idea that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon may have been located at Nineveh rather than further south.

The Al-Shaheed Monument was built under the regime of Saddam Hussein, during his push to fill Baghdad with lasting monuments during the 1970s and 80s, so in retrospect it may strike some as a troubling artifact from a despot’s rule, but it is hard to deny that it is a stunning work. The towering memorial was completed in 1983, designed by Iraqi sculptor,  Ismail Fatah Al Turk. It consists of a 132-foot tall arabesque dome, covered in teal-colored ceramic tiles. The huge bulb is split down the middle, with an eternal flame in between the hollow insides. The whole thing sits on a large, circular square that is itself held in an artificial lake. Beneath the monument are a library, a museum, and other facilities, all centered around the memory of the Iraqi soldiers who died during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq. There are also playgrounds and lawns surrounding the strange central monument, making the whole thing a sort of oasis. It may have been the product of a despicable Iraq ruler’s demands, but the Al-Shaheed Monument seems almost all the more amazing for it.",military history memorials monuments military

Rabban Mar Hormizd founded the monastery named after him in the year 640. Centuries later, it became one of the holiest sites for Chaldean Catholics. Yohannan Sulaqa, the first Patriarch of this Christian church, was abbot of Hormizd Monastery. His ascension as the head of the patriarchate in 1552 marked the schism between the Holy See of Rome and the Church of the East, which eventually became the Chaldean Christian Church. From then until the reunion of the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Holy See of Rome in the 19th century, Hormizd Monastery served as the residence of the patriarchs of this denomination. Though an important religious site, it soon fell into decline. In the mid-1700s, a slew of of attacks from Kurdish forces rendered the site all but abandoned. In 1828, its library, which was stocked with precious Syriac manuscripts, was looted and damaged. A new monastery was rebuilt in 1859 with the intention of improving its safety from attackers. The old sanctuary still remains an important, historic site for Chaldean Catholic worship. However, its proximity to Mosul and the political upheaval that the region has experienced in the past decade have created an unstable environment in which the future of the monastery is by no means certain.",catholic monasteries christianity ancient religion sacred spaces architecture

It is the only above-ground structure that remains of Ctesiphon, an ancient city that acted as the royal capital of the Persian Empire, notably during the Parthian and Sasanian periods, until the Muslim conquest of the region in the seventh century. While there is some debate as to the year of its construction, the archway is at least 1,400 years old. It was part of the city’s palace complex, possibly the ceiling of the throne room itself (although it could have also served as a portico). Rising to 37 meters (121 feet) in height and stretching a meter (3 feet) thick at its apex and 7 meters (23 feet) thick at its supporting base, it’s considered to be the largest single-span brick vault arch in the world. Some restoration was completed under Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, but progress was halted upon the beginning of the Gulf War.

These jars, previously overlooked, were found to be quite unique. Each contained copper and iron, and was sealed with asphalt. It was hypothesized based on the various components, that they were a type of battery, possibly used to electroplate metals. Since they were noticed long after they had been taken from outside of their archeological context, not much else is known about them. Mythbusters, the television show, recreated them and found that they were able to hold a charge and electroplate quite effectively. However, just because something could have been done, doesn’t mean it was done. The jars also very closely resemble jars designed to hold sacred scrolls.

The Mukharbarat used the location for the state’s torture and imprisonment of Iraq’s Kurdish population. Between 1986 and 1989, the Iraqi state conducted the al-Anfal Campaign, considered to be genocidal in intent, against the Iraqi Kurds. Conducted by Ali Hassan al-Majid under the direction of Saddam Hussein, al-Anfal utilized bombing, firing squads, mass deportation and forced relocation, ground offensives, settlement destruction, torture and imprisonment, and chemical warfare in an attempt to destroy the Kurdish population. The chemical gas attacks on Halabja, part of al-Anfal, earned al-Majid the nickname of “Chemical Ali.” A Human Rights Watch report documents the “systematic and deliberate murder of at least 50,000 and possibly as many as 100,000 Kurds” as a result of al-Anfal. Thousands of Kurds were tortured and executed at Amna Suraka. During the first Gulf War of 1991, the Kurdish guerilla army called the Peshmerga conducted an uprising in northern Iraq with the intent of liberating the country from Hussein’s control. Though ultimately unsuccessful, the uprising did see the capturing of  of the Amna Suraka by Kurds. Due in part to the efforts of Lady Hero Talabani, the wife of Iraqi president Jalal Talabani, Amna Suraka is now a national Museum of War Crimes. Visitors of the Amna Suraka today may explore the multi-story administrative building. It has been left largely as it was the day of its capture by Peshmerga: structurally intact but gutted and studded with holes from warfare. The basement, lit with deep, dark red, contains haunting photographs from the chemical attack in Halabja. Among the images is Ramazan Öztürk’s iconic image Silent Witness. School children on class visits to the museum climb about the various disused tanks and helicopters which sit in the courtyard outside the administrative building. The central building of the Museum of War Crimes opens with the Hall of Mirrors. What was once the offices and canteen of ranking members of the Ba’ath party is now a hall covered with 4,500 light bulbs representing villages destroyed during al-Anfal, and 182,000 shards of broken glass—for every person killed during the operation. The Hall of Mirrors also contains a replica of a traditional Kurdish home. Following the Hall of Mirrors are corridors and floors containing the prison cells where prisoners were held, tortured, raped and executed. Some cells are shadowed and empty, with Kurdish Arabic words written or carved out by the people who were imprisoned in the rooms or visitors who followed them. Local artist Kamaran Omar was commissioned to cast five life-size statues of prisoners handcuffed to walls, being beaten and hanging from electrical wires. The latter prisoner is accompanied by a recording of an interrogation. Echoing from within these barren, graffitied rooms surrounded with barbed wire, the effects of the recording are chilling. One cell contains a statue of Atta Ahmed Qadir, a Kurdish school-teacher lauded for his courage. Qadir was held in that very cell before his transfer to the Abu Ghraib prison, where he was executed in 1990. The Amna Suraka shares features with Cambodia’s Tuol Sleng prison of the Khmer Rouge: both buildings were used not just to imprison and torture, but as weapons for genocide. Both are urban prisons, with residences very nearby. Both have been preserved by the nations of the forces which liberated them to be correctives of history. And both leave the traveler stricken for having walked the halls and rooms where humans caused so much suffering and where humans suffered so much.",genocide war memorial prisons military history military museums and collections

Saddam Hussein built the monument to commemorate his very dubious “victory” over the United States in the 1991 Gulf War.

The unfinished palace served the Americans as a military base rather better than it ever did Saddam. As with all of Saddam’s former palaces, the Victory Over America Palace became something of a tourist spot for the Marines. The photo opportunities, after all, were irresistible. Today, the palace complex has been handed back to the Iraqi Government, and the Victory Over America Palace still stands, what there is of it, in any case.

72,Pira Delal,"Zakho, Iraq",This ancient stone bridge is a hub for daredevils.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pira-delal,"Because of a shortage of official documentation, the history of Pira Delal can be told only in speculative terms. Ancient Romans are credited with constructing of the first bridge that stretched across the river, but the current structure is not of Ancient Roman origins. It is, in fact, much more likely that the bridge in its current form dates back to the early years of Abbasid dynasty (750-1517). As with many ancient sites in Northern Iraq, Pira Delal, goes by several names, including Delal Bridge, Zakho Bridge, Pira Delal, Pirdí Delal, and Pira Berî. This is partly due to lexicographical changes through time, the co-existence of different language-speaking peoples, and formal versus informal registers. It is 377 feet (115 meters) long and 53 feet (16 meters) high at its apex. Local stones found in and around the Khabur River were used to construct the bridge. Their large size, however, has fueled a flurry of more or less plausible theories as to how they might have been deployed in ancient times. A rather grisly legend has it that the hands of the ingenious craftsman who built the bridge were amputated to prevent him from constructing another bridge that could compare to Pira Delal. Furthermore, one of the craftsman’s nieces is said to be buried under the bridge as a sacrificial offering. Today, even though there are newer, sturdier bridges that cross the Khabur River, this bridge still sees a fair amount of pedestrian, cyclist, and motorcyclist traffic. It’s also a hotspot for daredevils, who dive from its apex into the tiny pools that seasonally form at the foot of the bridge. If you take a close look at the bridge, you’ll notice that some of its stones are numbered. This was supposed to lead to maintenance work that never took place.

73,Qshla Koya,"Koysinjaq, Iraq",Qshla Koya is an Ottoman fortress located on a hillock in the central quarter of Koya.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qshla-koya,"Qshla Koya, also known as Qishla Koysinjaq, is a fortress located on a hillock in the central quarter of Koya, a lovely town in the Northeast of Iraq. Although there is a lack of consensus among scholars, it’s generally believed that Qshla Koya was constructed between 1869 and 1872, under the aegis of the Ottoman Empire. The purpose of the structure was unmistakably military, housing troops and providing a strategic vantage point to monitor the surrounding area. The enormous courtyard once used for military activities has been transformed into a garden. Enclosing the courtyard are fortified walls with round bastions at the corners. Along the walls that demarcate the perimeter of Qshla Koya are wide wall walks, where underneath, visitors can find the buttery, barracks, and stables. The dominant structure, however, is the two-story main building where the front gate is located. Two symmetrical sets of stairs lead to the upper floor of this building. Today, although Qshla Koya has lost its strategic military value, it has gained cultural standing. Now, the main building houses the Koya Civilization Museum. The museum was founded in 2003 and items on display include tablets with astounding samples of cuneiform script from 2000 BC; there is also pottery dating back to 6000 BC, ancient jars, coins, jewels, and a wealth of documents from the Ottoman period. Very few visitors make their way to this location, but those that do are likely to have the whole place to themselves.  From the wall walk, one can enjoy commanding views of Koya, along with the surrounding mountains and valleys.  A guardian is usually at the gate, but if the gate is locked, knock or ask people around and a guardian should be there in a matter of minutes.",fortresses military history & culture architecture
74,Mar Behnam Monastery,Iraq,"The history of Mar Behnam Monastery is that of violence, intolerance, resiliency, and spirituality.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mar-behnam-monastery,"During the 4th-century CE, King Senchareb of Nineveh commissioned the building of this monastery as an act of atonement for having killed his son, Behnam, and daughter Sarah for converting to Christianity. Behnam, was eventually sanctified, hence the title Mar, a title of sainthood in the Assyrian language. He and Sarah’s bodies were buried in a crypt at the monastery. The site quickly became a beacon for Christian pilgrims throughout the region. As a result, the monastery attracted several artists that contributed paintings, bas-reliefs, and statues to the collection of artifacts at the site. The more prestigious the monastery became, the more pilgrims it attracted. It also drew the ire of other groups across the region. Most notably, Nader Shah targeted the monastery during the 18th-century because of its importance to Christianity. Albeit damaged, the monastery survived. Several restorations occurred over the next few years in an attempt to preserve the invaluable works of art and architecture of the monastery. The site’s historical ties have more recently caught the eye of terrorist organizations, such as the Islamic State Group. In 2015, the group planted 19 bombs around the monastery in an attempt to destroy it. However, they failed to detonate, except for a few bombs planted nearby that did damage the monastery. Sadly, it appears the tombs of Behnam and Sarah were destroyed, but the monastery survived. Extensive work is currently ongoing to salvage what can be salvaged, repair what can be repaired, and rebuild what was destroyed.",monasteries christianity history & culture architecture

So much so, in some places it is just leaking out. Just outside the town of  Chamchamal, a water well flowing with methane gas has been continually ablaze, the fire burning for more than two years now. The well was dug in 2015 to irrigate a nearby farm. Since then, the fire has been consuming about 2,200 liters of gas per day, causing health and environmental concerns in the area. The root of the problem are the old wells dug for oil exploration in Chamchamal by the British and Iraqi governments in the mid-20th century. The excavation caused high gas pressure in the area. The boiling water is combined with an ever present methane which has been ignited and continually blazes. The intensity of the heat is incredible; just standing within the collapsed fenced area and you’re likely to be sweating profusely.

Gliding across the water is a fantastic way to admire the massive stone pillars that rise to meet a high ceiling of elegant arches. The Pool of Arches (also called the Pool of St. Helena and the Pool of Goats) was originally built as an underground reservoir in 789 to supply water to the residents of Ramla. According to Christian tradition, St. Helena ordered its construction. And its other name, Pool of Goats, is also fitting, as the four-legged beasts used the cistern in the past. Despite enduring millennia of earthquakes, the structure is still safe to visit for those looking to head underground and catch an incredible glimpse of some centuries-old infrastructure.  Descend a short but steep flight of stairs into the cool, dimly lit space. There, you’ll find simple rowboats waiting to be boarded. After piling into the boats and taking the oars, you’re on your own! You can spend about 20 minutes navigating between the 15 stone pillars. See if you can spot the inscription on the stone wall commemorating the reservoir’s construction. If you look up, you can see square hatches carved into the stone where people would lower their buckets to collect water. When you finally surface, there is a small exhibit covering the history of the building and reservoir.

Through millennia of strong waves bashing up against the soft chalk cliffs on the Mediterranean Sea, large sea caves have formed around the base. Since their modern discovery these lovely geological anomalies have generally been open only to those with the skill and equipment to approach the formations from sea. However as the popularity of the site grew, a new solution needed to be devised in order to cater to the growing number of visitors clamoring to check out the grottoes. To meet the rising demand, a cable car was installed to ferry tourists down to the site to check out the sea caves. The gondola cars carry from the top of the white cliffs to the bottom, covering over 200 feet in about two minutes. The speed of the ride is achieved by the stark slope of the cable lines which make it the steepest cable car system in the world. Were the cables any more vertical, the system would be an elevator. Given the site’s proximity to the Israel-Lebanon border also saw the creation of a famous train tunnel that can also be visited. However the bright blue waters filling the Rosh HaNikra Grottoes make that feat of human engineering seem a bit less impressive.",grottoes geological oddities geology
80,Beit Guvrin Caves,"Ashkelon, Israel",These numerous Israeli caves were dug out over hundreds years for reasons ranging from hideouts to burial sites.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beit-guvrin-caves,"Dug out from beneath an area that was once known as the cities of Maresha and Beit Guvrin, the network of caves, named after the latter city, seem to have been created for a number of different reasons down the ages but stand today to amaze contemporary travelers. Maresha was the first city to stand on the site, dating back before the common era, however it was eventually sacked and replaced by Beit Guvrin. This new city thrived in the area until it too was conquered by the Romans, leaving behind little but ruins and the caves. The soft chalk earth of the Judean Lowlands made it possible to construct the thousands of caves, using the non-mechanized technology of the time. Archeologists have discovered chambers dating from multiple eras including Sidonian, Israelite, and Roman. Some of the caves appear to have been created to serve as defenses and hideouts, while others still look to have been made simply by chalk mining. Perhaps the most impressive portion of the over 3,000 chamber network are the painted burial rooms created by the Sidonians. These subterranean hollows are painted in bright, vibrant colors that have managed to maintain much of their character over the centuries thanks in large part to their protection from the elements. Above ground ruins of the city of Maresha as well as a Roman amphitheater can also be found, but it is what lies underground that’s really worth the pilgrimage.",subterranean subterranean sites caves ecosystems
81,Razzouk Ink,"Jerusalem, Israel",This family tattoo parlor has been inking religious pilgrims in the Middle East for 700 years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/razzouk-ink,"In Jerusalem’s Old City today, you can find a uniquely obscure historical relic—the sole surviving pilgrimage tattoo business, Razzouk Ink. It’s a place where ancient artifacts meet contemporary machines, rich history intersects with modern technology. Just inside the Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem’s Old City, you can duck down the second side street to the left, finding respite from the beating sun and leaving the bustle of the crowded main square. A tiny shop, almost dwarfed by its prominent sign, lies across a quiet cobblestone road. If you didn’t know anything about the incredible, centuries-long history of the family who runs this particular shop, the sign’s tagline might cause you to do a double-take: “Tattoo With Heritage Since 1300” it reads. For 700 years the Razzouk family has been tattooing marks of faith. Coptic Christians who settled in Jerusalem four generations ago, the family had learned the craft of tattooing in Egypt, where the devout wear similar inscriptions. Evidence of such tattoos dates back at least as far as the 8th century in Egypt and the 6th century in the Holy Land, where Procopius of Gaza wrote of tattooed Christians bearing designs of crosses and Christ’s name. Early tattoos self-identified indigenous Christians in the Middle East and Egypt. Later, as the faithful came to the Holy Land on pilgrimage, the practice expanded to offer these travelers permanent evidence of their devotion and peregrination. Upon entering Razzouk Ink, you will discover a blend of stone walls and exposed beams lending antique character to the space, while the sterile tattoo parlor hides behind a wall. A museum-like case holds family antiques, and an exhibition of pictures on the walls offers glimpses into the family’s past. Pilgrims’ accounts dating to the late 16th century offer a glimpse into the era’s tattoo culture, and how purveyors such as the Razzouks must have tattooed back then, with sewing needles bound to the end of a wooden handle. In the 21st century, tattoos have emerged as popular travel souvenirs, but Razzouk Ink offers a truly unique experience—a link to hundreds of years of history through a visceral transaction of bloodletting and pain.",tattoos religion sacred spaces history
82,Shrine of the Book,"Jerusalem, Israel",The home of the Dead Sea Scrolls is an abstract modernist dream.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shrine-of-the-book,"Housing the ancient biblical parchments known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, Israel’s Shrine of the Book surrounds the crumbling artifacts in a surreal modern womb built specifically to rotate the delicate pages for viewing. The bulbous museum was constructed in 1965 specifically to house the scrolls which had been discovered a few years earlier in a cave in the Judean Desert. In 1946, a Bedouin teenager accidentally found seven ancient scrolls housed in jars in a cave in the wadi near Qumran. He had no idea that this was the beginning of such a significant discovery.  A total of 20 complete scrolls and 16,000 fragments of scrolls were found in 12 caves between 1947 and 1956. Out of these fragments, Researchers have assembled a total of 981 manuscripts. Most of them are books of the Torah (Old Testament) written in Hebrew. The exterior of the shrine is a rounded peak with sculpted striations rippling up its walls. The strangely organic edifice belies the true grandeur of the site as well since the shrine actually extends well into the ground. Across from the white exterior is a black, basalt wall. The two features are meant to represent a specific scroll that talks about the “Sons of Light,” represented by the shrine itself, and “Sons of Darkness,” represented by the squat back wall. Inside the surprisingly spacious shrine, selected Dead Sea Scrolls are on display year round. There are glass cases on the outer ring of the shrine that contain pages, but it is the central display which is made to look like a giant Torah scroll, complete with handle, that dominates the space. More pages of the scrolls are displayed in a spinning lit ring that circles the giant scroll. Due to the fragility of the scrolls, the displayed pages are cycled out on a regular basis so that no one section deteriorates from being displayed. The Shrine of the Book is a part of the Israel Museum but it stands alone as both a unique architectural experience and a one of a kind religious pilgrimage.  The museum is open Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is open Tuesdays from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and and holiday eves from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and Saturdays from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.",temples architectural oddities museums architecture
83,Masada,"Masada, Israel",This daunting 1st century fortress was purportedly the site of one of the most dramatic revolts of the Jewish-Roman wars.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/masada,"Soldiers being inducted into the Israeli Defense Forces take their oath at different places in the country, but the pledge always ends with the line, “Masada shall not fall again.” The story behind this inclusion dates back 2,000 years, all the way to the first century. Masada, a stunning natural fortress in Israel’s Judean desert, was built in the Roman style by Herod, the king of Judea sometime between 37 and 31 BC. Perched nearly 1,500 feet above the Dead Sea on one side and flanked by the desert on the other side, the daunting complex was meant to be the king’s refuge. It was designed to include a private palace for him, as well as administrative centers, storehouses, and an armory. Several decades after Herod’s death, a group of Jews that were revolting against the Romans stormed the Roman garrison at Masada and set up base there. They were joined by the families of Jewish Zealots who were fleeing from trouble in Jerusalem. For three years, the group managed to defend the fortress against the Romans, but in year 73, the Romans laid siege to Masada, building a ramp around the walls, and battering the barriers until a hole was created. The population of Jews inside knew they had no means of escape and decided to kill each other to avoid being captured by the enemy. They drew lots to decide who would kill whom, until only 10 men were left alive to kill the rest, and then themselves. When the Romans finally entered the complex, they found nearly 1,000 corpses. The Siege of Masada, as it was called, was one of the final events in the first Jewish-Roman war. After being used briefly as a retreat for Byzantine monks in the 6th century, the fortress remained untouched for more than 13 centuries, and all signs of human habitation slowly disappeared. It wasn’t rediscovered until the 19th century, and detailed excavations were carried out even later. The site has come to be a poignant symbol for the struggle of the Jewish people against oppression. The remains of many buildings in the complex have been restored, including Herod’s private palace with its hanging terraces, bathhouses with preserved mosaics and murals, a synagogue, and the siege ramp and camp set up by the Romans. They stand testament to the fortress’s role in history. Note, however, that contemporary archaeologists have yet to arrive at a definitive consensus about the true story of the fall of Masada.  Like so many things in Israel, this site is best reached by car. It is possible to walk to the top of Masada, but there are also cable cars at regular intervals. Once at the top it is possible to wander at will. Don't go in summer when the exposed site and bright stone will be both blinding and incredibly hot! There are several ways to reach the archaeological site at the top of the mountain. A cable car is available to take people to the top. Or, if you're up for it, climb up the “Snake Path.” The more ambitious climb the “Snake Path” to watch the sunrise over the Dead-Sea. The most exciting and demanding option is to make a full day hike. Climb up the mountain on the ancient “Runners” path, visit Masada, then get down via Elazar Mountain. You will visit the ruins of several Roman siege camps and get amazing views of Masada from different angles.",judaism fortresses roman war history religion abandoned military sacred spaces ruins history architecture
84,Western Wall Tunnel,"East Jerusalem, Israel","Descend 2,030 years into the past in an ancient tunnel built to support Jerusalem's most famous wall.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/western-wall-tunnel,"In 19 BC, Herod the Great expanded the Temple on the Mount by flattening a plateau on the hillside and enclosing it with four stone walls. These walls still remain, the only original part of the historic temple, now regarded as a holy site for Jews who know it as the Kotel and leave prayers on tiny paper scrolls in its crevices. Lesser known is the tunnel beneath the wall, which may hold some ancient secrets. When the Western Wall was built, in order for the retaining wall to support itself at least half of its height had to be underground. It’s estimated that some 10,000 laborers carried out the work of digging the tunnels and building the walls around the new temple. This massive piece of infrastructure was uncovered in the 19th century, when researchers from Britain unearthed the tunnels. However, the researchers weren’t able to discern what they were because the excavation was halted by political conflict. For 50 years the tunnels remained an unexplained mystery, but in 1967 Israel’s Ministry of Religion picked up the project of excavating the entire length of the wall. In addition to dating the wall, excavators found various structures that illustrated and uncovered pieces of Jerusalem history. One such discovery is Warren’s Gate (named for one of the original British researchers), a clandestine entrance to the temple from underground. When Jerusalem was overtaken by Muslims during the Crusades, Jews were allowed to pray in the tunnels. The Gate was and is a popular place to pray because it is believed to be the closest point of access to the Holy of Holies within the temple. The tunnels were also public works. They contained numerous channels that supplied water to the temple, as well as a pool that may have been a bath or cistern. There is also architectural evidence that both the Romans and the Muslim Caliphates that ruled Jerusalem performed reconstruction on the tunnels, indicating they used them as thoroughfares. The tunnels today are open to the public, attracting history lovers who marvel at the precision of this ancient architecture and the faithful glad for the close access to the holy wall. Paper prayers can be found tucked into cracks even this far below ground. The Western Wall Tunnels are still slowly being excavated, and new artifacts, from ancient coins to earthenware, are still being found.",judaism walls underground tunnels infrastructure subterranean sites ancient religion archaeology sacred spaces
85,Avshalom Cave,Israel,This amazing ancient cave was kept secret for seven years to protect it from the public.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/avshalom-cave,"In May 1968, workers at the Hartuv quarry in the Judean Hills were quarrying with explosives. Each blast was much like the one before, until a strange gap opened up in the rock face. Peering inside, the men discovered a large cave, its roof dripping with stalactites, the oldest of which would later be dated to around 300,000 years old. After its discovery, local authorities decided to keep the cave a secret, fearing the ancient formations would be damaged if it were opened to the public. Seven years later, on March 16, 1975, the cave was declared a nature reserve and its secrets were revealed. The Avshalom Cave, also known as the Soreq Cave, has since become one of Israel’s most incredible natural wonders. From the roof of the 50,000-square-foot cavern hangs a forest of stalactites, the largest more than 13 feet long, slowly formed over millennia by the slow dripping of water through cracks in the ceiling. Rising up from the floor beneath them are a series of towering stalagmites, while some stalactites and stalagmites have joined to form pillars. The result is a strange subterranean world of bizarre formations, with organic-looking shapes that resemble coral reefs and tentacles. Other formations have been compared to a whole range of objects: elephant ears, ice cream cones, the Lion King, and the U.S. Capitol Building. The whole effect has been made even more trippy since the installation of a modern lighting system. For years, the cave was illuminated by the white light of automobile headlamps. This, however, triggered photosynthesis and the algae inside the cave began to grow, threatening to cover the bare rock formations in a uniform smudge of dark green moss. The park officials then tried using ultraviolet light at night to kill the algae, but the algae eventually developed an immunity to UV light. In 2012, a new anti-algae tactic was employed. A lighting system was installed that used only a limited part of the color spectrum, with shifting shades of orange, blue and green. Not only did this help to control the algae, it also gave the cave an otherworldly appearance that made the whole experience all the more memorable. At the time, some park officials had mixed feelings about the new lighting, worrying it would detract from the cave’s natural beauty. Boris Kripak, a Russian-born archaeologist who worked at the cave, told the Los Angeles Times: “We don’t want to turn the cave into a discotheque.” But he also admitted that the shifting colors, which range from bright orange to deep purple, had given new life to the ancient cavern, saying “It’s like the cave is breathing.”  Avshalom Cave, also known as Soreq Cave, is located on the western side of Mt. Ye'ela in the Judean Hills in Israel, about 12 miles west of Jerusalem. It is located inside the Stalactite Cave Nature Reserve. Public transport directly to the reserve is limited, but you can head to nearby Bet Shemesh by bus or by train and take a taxi to the cave from there. Guided tours can be arranged at the cave; for guided tours in English, check ahead for the schedule. The standard entrance fee is 28 ILS for adults ($8 US) and 14 ILS for children ($4). Opening hours change between summer and winter, and for holidays.

There, you’ll find serene desert silence, disturbed only by the sound of water rushing through a gorge. Wadi Qelt is a stream that runs from the northwestern slopes of the Judaean Desert just outside Jerusalem and down to the city of Jericho. It’s one of the biggest and only sources of running water in the Judean Desert. The area has a long human history. Look around, and you’ll be able to spot the ruins of the ancient aqueducts that once delivered precious water to Jericho. The aqueduct ruins aren’t the only traces of the past you’ll find there, as this place has attracted monks since the early days of Christianity. The Monastery of Faran (also known as the Chariton Monastery), located along the upper section of the canyon, was the first Christian monastery to be built in the Judean Desert around 330 CE. The Monastery of St. George of Choziba, located within the lower section of the canyon, is a sixth-century complex, complete with an old chapel and gardens. Both monasteries are built hanging on the cliffs of the canyon, creating an amazing sight to behold. Once you’re done soaking in all the area’s history, you can cool off by literally soaking in its waters. The various waterfalls and pools within the gorge provide ample swimming opportunities.  The Wadi can be visited in a variety of ways to suit all tastes and skill levels. You can just visit one of the monasteries, with or without a short walk along the canyon. Or, you can take a short walk and swim/picnic near one of the pools. Lastly, you can take a real hike to combine everything together.

Wedged between city buildings and accessible only by a small side street, the public neighborhood garden is relatively unknown. It is mostly visited by young families, their kids keep busy in the playground enjoying the slides and swings. But right up a small staircase rests an archeological discovery of a wine press from the Hellenistic period, around 400 to 200 BC. The stone wine press is comprised of three parts: a flat surface where the grapes would get stomped, a shallow silo to separate the waste, and a deep silo where the grape juice collected. Stone pillars and millstones from the the same era are also present, scattered about the garden and often used as makeshift benches for visitors. The garden has an interesting history: In the 1940s it was a transportation base for the British army, only to be inherited by the Israeli Defense Forces when Israel received its independence in 1948. In the following decade the IDF planned on developing the base for its purposes, but when construction began the tractors accidentally bumped into archeological remnants. The municipality of Tel Aviv then changed its plans. It called in the archeologist Doctor Yaakov Kaplan who spent the next decade or so excavating the wine press and dated it back to the times of the great king and high priest Alexander Jannaeus. The municipality further developed the site for public use, planting trees of the Seven Species—namely olive, palm and pomegranate tress—to fortify the Israeli atmosphere. In 1971 the site had its official reveal to the public and was declared a public garden. When you admire the wine press and sit on the ancient stone pillars, don’t forget to check out a small, hidden staircase passage to the left of the wine press. Leading down to what appears almost like a grotto, be sure to run your hands on the impressive walls made of thinly cut sheets of kurkar rock (lithified sand dune) and drink the water coming out of the fountain hidden in the rock. The bench opposite the fountain is often frequented by lovers due to its hidden location. Garden is free and open to the public at all times.",grottoes wine hidden ancient parks archaeology
88,Zedekiah's Cave,"East Jerusalem, Israel","An ancient quarry rediscovered by a dog and claimed by biblical kings, a German cult, and the Freemasons.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zedekiahs-cave,"The limestone rock quarry known as Zedekiah’s Cave under the Old City of Jerusalem has been a center of legend and ceremony for thousands of years. There are several stories about the cave that are matters of faith. Legend says that stones from the quarry were commissioned by King Solomon and used to build the lost First Temple, which is why the site is sometimes referred to as Solomon’s Quarries. Another biblical king, King Zedekiah, is said to have attempted to flee a besieged Jerusalem for Jericho through this cave. When he was captured by henchmen of the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar, his sons were murdered in front of him before his eyes were put out. He spent the rest of his life blind and imprisoned. The drops of water that trickle through the cavern’s ceiling are today known as “Zedekiah’s tears.” Still another legend marks the quarry as the final resting place of Korah, who led a rebellion against Moses and was swallowed up by the earth in a godly act of retribution. What can be proven through archeology and historical corroboration, however, is perhaps equally remarkable. The 300-foot-long subterranean chamber is entirely man-made, hollowed out by generations of labor. The total size is estimated at around five acres. Around 50 CE, Herod the Great used this quarry for building projects, including the Second Temple and what is now the Western Wall. Suleiman the Magnificent would have the cave sealed during the 16th century, fearing that invaders would be able to use it to dig tunnels right into the heart of Jerusalem. The cave remained sealed until 1854, when an American missionary named James Turner Barclay discovered the entrance, after his dog ran into a small opening that had been revealed by heavy rainfall. In the 1880s, a German religious cult moved into the cavern, but was removed by Turkish and German authorities. The Freemasons were also drawn to the cave, as they hold particular kinship to King Solomon, who is believed to have been the first Grand Master. The group held their first ceremony in the cave in 1868 and the Freemasons of Israel continue to hold an annual ceremony in it every year. The last known use of the cave as a quarry was for the building of the clock tower above the Jaffa Gate in the in early 1900s. However, anyone acquainted with the cavern’s long history knows there’s still time for many more tales to be told.",freemasons biblical quarries caves ecosystems

It’s hard to imagine a more striking contrast between the concrete hotel blocks and the dramatic desert landscape just behind it. The most striking feature of the Eilat Mountains is the variety of rock formations and colors. The colors change radically from black to white, yellow, red, and purple, creating a festival of colors. This color pallet is spread over craggy rock formations, some of which are very special. The best way to enjoy this landscape is by hiking the Red Canyon. The highlight of this relaxed three-mile (five-kilometer) hike is the section that passes through the gorge, where you’ll squeeze between nearly 100-foot-tall (30 meters) walls made of reddish-colored Nubian Sandstone. At some spots, the width narrows down to less than three feet (one meter). At times, you’ll need to use metal ladders and surf down a natural slide created by the smooth-faced rocks.  The Red Canyon trailhead can be reached also with public bus #392 from Eilat central bus station. It's a natural reserve, but there is no admission fee and is open 24 hours. Camping is allowed in a designated area near the parking lot. This short hike has it all. It's great fun for kids, but its unique natural beauty will also appeal to experienced hikers.

90,Museum On The Seam,"Jerusalem, Israel",Sitting right on the border between East and West Jerusalem this modern art museum is in itself a symbol of Israel's hoped-for unity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-on-the-seam,"The Museum on the Seam is exactly what it sounds like, residing on the border of East and West Jerusalem that many consider to be the invisible rift within the city, yet this socio-political art space hopes to serve as a bridge instead of a band-aid. Established in 1999, and operating since 2005 the museum is housed in a property that itself has a long history of being torn between Jerusalem’s opposing forces. Built in 1932, the building was used as an Israeli military outpost right on the border when the city was officially divided. During the six-day war of 1967 the building was damaged by bomb and bullet strikes, taking out a large chunk of a balcony that has been left damaged as reminder of the conflicts. As the city began reunification following the fighting, the site became host to a semi-permanent exhibition devoted to encouraging peace between the people of the region. The museum that currently inhabits the space continues to devote itself to messages of unification and healing. A number of exhibitions have taken place at the space focusing on themes such as human rights, protest, and national anxiety. The museum believes that art can act as a unifying language transcending borders, religions, and conflicts and can provide a medium unlike any other in which the often opposed citizens can create meaningful conversation. If things go their way, and their message of unification takes root, the Museum on the Seam may one day simply be named, “The Museum.”",politics museums and collections museums
91,Atlit Yam,"Haifa, Israel","Submerged ruins of a Neolithic coastal settlement, where houses, wells, graves and skeletons have been unearthed.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atlit-yam,"Off the coast of the village of Atlit lie the submerged ruins of the Neolithic site of Atlit-Yam. The site, which dates between 6900 and 6300 BC, lies around 10 m beneath the current sea level and covers an area of 40,000 m². The site was discovered in 1984 by marine archaeologist Ehud Galili, and since then underwater excavations have unearthed houses, graves and wells. At the center of the settlement seven megaliths are arranged in a stone semicircle around a freshwater spring, which may once have been the site of water rituals. Scientists believe that Atlit-Yam was abandoned suddenly as a result of a tsunami hitting the region, probably caused by a volcanic eruption in the Mediterranean area. Large piles of fish discovered at the site appear to support this theory. Of particular interest to archaeologists were the discovery of two skeletons, a woman and a child, which have revealed the earliest known cases of tuberculosis.

But as you enter the narrow canyon, very soon you start to notice the green vegetation at the creek bed. A few minutes further up, the first pool is revealed. As you venture deeper, the canyon begins to narrow, finally ending with massive cliffs closing in from all sides. At the bottom lies Ein Avdat, a deep pool of clear and cold water fed by a 50-foot waterfall. This breathtaking oasis is located in the Nahal Zin, or “Zin Valley,” the longest wadi in the Negev Desert of southern Israel. Ein is the Hebrew word for “spring,” and Avdat refers to the ancient Nabatean city nearby, which was a trading post along the incense route thousands of years ago. Water holes in the desert are always a magical site, but in antiquity, they were also essential for survival in this arid region. The earliest signs of permanent human dwellings in the area date back to the Byzantine era, when Christian monks lived in caves along the canyon that can still be seen today. Inside these cavernous dwellings you can see rooms where the monks lived and prayed, and niches that served as cupboards. The monks also carved staircases leading to the springs. The caves were abandoned after the Muslim conquest of the region, and today they are part of the Ein Avdat National Park.  The pools, canyon, and caves are located within the Ein Avdat National Park. There is a large parking area at the site. Most visitors take a short, flat trail from the parking area to the pools and back. However, there is also an option for an exciting full-day hike. When you reach the waterfall, climb up the cliff and return to the starting point through the colorful Marl wadi of Havarim.",oasis pools spring national parks deserts caves ancient natural wonders ecosystems water nature

In 1952, Eli Avivi settled at the ruined village of Akhziv, which was destroyed during the Arab-Israeli wars, and started to illegally construct a number of huts. Some of these huts were torn down by the Israeli government in 1970, but before all the buildings were demolished, Avivi proclaimed the territory the independent state of Akhzivland. Avivi subsequently brought the Israeli government to trial, which created quite some attention in the Israeli media. Surprisingly, Avivi succeeded and the court ruled to lease Avivi the area of 10,000 m² for 99 years. Despite the legal victory, the legal status of the micronation remained in ambiguity. Ever since its creation under Avivi’s ideals of pacifism and freedom, the “nation” has been peaceful. Akhzivland is the only “country” in the Middle East that has never been engaged in any military conflict. As of 2011, the micronation had a total population of two, plus a couple of dogs and cats, as well as many domestic and international tourists, who sleep at Akhzivland’s camping ground and several guest rooms. The country even features a small “national museum,” as well as the unique opportunity of getting a passport stamp from Akhzivland. Over the years, the micro nation has even attracted several celebrities and politicians such as Shimon Peres and Sofia Loren among others.",micro-nations utopia week places to stay eccentric homes homes
94,Immovable Ladder on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,"East Jerusalem, Israel","A ""miracle"" that seems to produce more holy fistfights than holy revelations.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/immovable-ladder-church-holy-sepulchre,"The immovable ladder of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a religious symbol of a sort, a kind of miracle possible only through human folly. It is also one of the most powerful and iconic symbols of the divisions and religious disputes within Christian World. Proposed as the site of the death and resurrection of Jesus, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is one of the holiest places in Christianity and has been the site of pilgrimages since the 4th century. However, even this most venerated shrine could not escape the quirks of human nature, vanity, pride and envy. Even from its earliest days Christianity was subject to splintering, creating numerous denominations and sects, all claiming to be the only true school of followers of Jesus Christ. The most prominent of these fought bitterly over the centuries for the dominance over the holy places in the Holy Land. During the time of Muslim dominance over the area, a government equally hostile to all Christian denominations, no one sect could achieve a clear advantage over the others. As the disputes rolled on, the methods of gaining advantage became ever more dubious including outright bribery, blackmail, and the use of force. Today, the current situation is an uneasy status quo, a kind of fragile compromise reached in several stages, through the mediation of the Ottoman empire and several European powers. The care over the church is shared by no less than six denominations. The primary custodians are the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic and Roman Catholic Church, with lesser duties shared by Coptic, Ethiopian and Syriac Orthodox churches. The whole edifice is carefully parceled into sections, some being commonly shared while others belonging strictly to a particular sect. A set of complicated rules governs the transit rights of the other groups through each particular section on any given day, and especially during the holidays. However, some of the sections of the church still remain hotly disputed to this day. Arguments and violent clashes are not uncommon. In November 2008 the internet was flooded with videos of a fistfight between Armenian and Greek monks in one such dispute. A small section of the roof of the church is disputed between the Copts and Ethiopians. At least one Coptic monk at any given time sits there on a chair placed on a particular spot to express this claim. On a hot summer day he moved his chair some 20cm more into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile act and violation of status quo. Eleven were hospitalized after a fight resulting from this provocation. This state of affairs makes any agreement about renovations or repairs on the edifice impossible. The church is in a state of decay as a result. The famous immovable ladder is a bizarre outcome of this religious stubbornness pushed to extremes. Some time in the first half of the 18th century, someone placed a ladder up against the wall of the church. No one is sure who he was, or more importantly, to which sect he belonged. The ladder remains there to this date. No one dares touch it, lest they disturb the status quo, and provoke the wrath of others. The exact date when ladder was placed is not known but the first evidence of it comes from a 1728 engraving by Elzearius Horn. The ladder hasn’t moved since.",ruins
95,Makhtesh Ramon,"Ramat Negev Regional Council, Israel","A massive, heart-shaped, wind-carved crater in the middle of the Israeli desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/makhtesh-ramon,"Makhtesh Ramon is the largest of Israel’s bizarre geological formations called makhteshim (literally, “craters”). Thought for many years to be an impact crater, the result of a meteor colliding with the deserts of southern Israel, geologists began noticing inconsistencies between the makhtesh and normal crater formations. After a long and trying investigation, the culprit was revealed: erosion. Thousands of years ago, the deserts of southern Israel were at the bottom of a vast, primordial sea. As it dried, the hard outer crust of the sea bottom began to wear away, exposing its soft interior. This interior eroded quickly until the tough crust collapsed, creating the crater-like valley we see today. Since then, two seasonal rivers, Nahal Ramon and Nahal Ardon, have formed every rainy season, further carving away at the rock and giving Ramon its distinctive heart shape. Today, Makhtesh Ramon, at 40 km long and 2-10 km wide, has been made into Israel’s largest national park, the Ramon Nature Reserve. Expeditions can be launched from the valley’s only town, Mitzpe Ramon (“Ramon Observation Point”), on the northern rim, although visitors should be mindful to stay out of the incredible mid-day heat. Rappelling is occasionally done in the cliffs directly behind the Visitors Center in Mitzpe Ramon. Make sure to join when there’s one scheduled during your visit! Makhtesh Ramon also has some of the most intriguing biodiversity in the Israeli desert. Ibex, porcupines, gazelles, wild donkeys, hyaenas, hyraxes, and a few Arabian Leopards all live in Makhtesh Ramon, among countless smaller lizards and rodents. At night, hikers should take advantage of one of the many hotels established by local Bedouin herders, where visitors can sleep in hand-woven tents while enjoying world-renowned Bedouin black coffee and the cool desert air. Staying at least one night is a must – far from the city lights, the stars in Makhtesh Ramon has been said to be so brilliant that they can “restore your faith in God.” Other must-sees include Giv’at Ga’ash, a pitch-black 100-million-year-old extinct volcano arising from the crater floor, a few scattered Nabatean ruins, and Wadi Nikarot (“Grotto Riverbed”), a dry riverbed flanked by spectacular cave formations dug out by the fast-moving rivers of spring, and HaMinsara (the carpentry), an area where the rocks once formed hexagonal pillars, most of which have collapsed and are scattered across the surrounding area appearing like wood chips (hence the name). But hike at your own risk – flash floods have been known to kill inattentive walkers.  In recent years, Ramon Crater is receiving new attention due to the sad and touching story of Ilan Ramon (who was named after the Makhtesh). Ramon was an IAF fighter pilot and the first Israeli astronaut. In January 2003, he boarded together with his six American colleagues the Columbia space shuttle. After 16 days in space, on February 1, 2003, the Columbia disintegrated upon re-entering Earth’s atmosphere, killing all seven crew members. In memory of Ilan and his six friends, a very special memorial site was set up on the edge of the crater's cliff.  The specific spot was chosen because it is overlooking seven black basalt hills sticking out of the bright crater bottom. Each hill was named after one of the seven crew members of the Columbia. The vista is breathtaking and can be reaching only by foot. The path is about one mile long and starts at the Mount Ramon parking area.",geological oddities geology
96,David Waterfall,"Ein Gedi, Israel",The tallest waterfall in the Judean Desert is named for its connection to a biblical figure.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/david-waterfall,"At the edge of the Judean Desert, a stunning water feature can be found not far from the edge of the Dead Sea. Known as David Waterfall, water drops 120 feet (36 meters) into a shallow pool. Entry to the pool is forbidden. The waterfall is located about a mile’s (1.5 km) walk from the entrance of the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve. Along the way, there are several smaller waterfalls, cascades, and pools, all flowing from the Nahal David (David River). From the foot of the waterfall, you can continue on another path that brings you to the small Dudim cave located just above the head of the waterfall. The waterfall and river get their names from the biblical figure King David. A story in the first book of Samuel, chapter 24, describes King Saul, with a force of 3,000 soldiers, chasing the young David. He is jealous of David’s popularity among the people after David’s victory over Goliath. According to the story, David snuck behind King Saul one night, and used his sword to cut a piece from Saul’s coat. The next morning, David confronted the king, using the piece of cloth to prove that he could have killed Saul but chose to spare his life. This story is believed to have unfolded in Dudim Cave. Besides its historical importance, this spot is unique because of how it contrasts with its barren desert surroundings. and the gushing water with the green vegetation around it.  The Ein Gedi Nature Reserve is open in the summer from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Fridays and holiday eves.

97,Judean Date Palm Methuselah,"Ketura, Israel","This tree was extinct for a thousand years before sprouting again from a 2,000-year-old seed.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/judean-date-palm-methuselah,"A tree grown from a 2,000-year-old seed may bring its sub-species back to Israel, where it once flourished, after a millennium-long absence. The seed was one of six discovered in 1963, in a jar in Herod the Great’s palace at the Masada fortress in Israel. Radiocarbon dating found that the seeds, preserved by the arid climate, were from some time between 155 B.C. and A.D. 64. In 2005, Elaine Solowey, from the Center for Sustainable Agriculture at the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, decided to try planting three of them. She was skeptical, and supposed that the seeds’ endosperm, which fuels its early growth, would no longer be viable. The seed was treated with a hormone-rich solution and fertilizer, and then planted on the grounds of the institute in Ketura. One soon sprouted into a sapling. Twelve years later, it is more than 10 feet tall. A male of its sub-species, it was nicknamed Methuselah after the longest-lived person in the Bible. It is the oldest known germination of a seed in the world. At first, the leaves were plagued with white blotches, suggesting insufficient nutrients, but eventually the plant thrived. It first flowered in 2011 and it produces pollen, which enables it to reproduce with modern date palms, as it did in 2015. The Judean date palm has deep cultural meaning in the region. In the Bible, King David names his daughter Tamar, which is the Hebrew word for the plant. In the Quran, Maryam (the Arabic name for the Virgin Mary) was advised to eat what was probably a Judean palm date to ease her labor pains. Date palms feature on both ancient Hebrew and modern Israeli currency. Despite this long regional history, the sub-species was wiped out by years of devastation from wars and foreign rule. Solowey has grown more Judean date palms from the other ancient seeds since the success of Methuselah, and is working on growing a grove of the resurrected variety. Others are investigating the medicinal properties it is reported to have, which modern date palms don’t appear to share.",biblical trees ancient archaeology plants
98,Dead Sea Sinkholes,"Ein Gedi, Israel","As the Dead Sea continues to deplete, massive sinkholes open along its banks.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dead-sea-sinkholes,"Every year, hundreds of sinkholes open along the banks of the Dead Sea, some as deep as a two-story building. And although the pockmarked landscape may look striking in aerial photos, the sinkholes are a big problem - one that will require significant human effort to remedy. The Dead Sea is actually a lake, or has been since its outlet to the Sea of Galilee evaporated around 18,000 years ago. The pool sits nearly at 1400 feet below sea level, making it the lowest point on earth. Its famously salty water - 10 times saltier than the Atlantic Ocean - is thanks to the huge quantities of minerals that have been deposited and trapped in the lake bed over millennia. Salt plays a supporting role in the sinkhole outbreak. People play a much larger one. Demand for water from the Jordan River, the main tributary of the Dead Sea, has ramped up in the last few decades, with water being siphoned off for drinking, irrigation, and industrial activity. This diversion has caused the Dead Sea to shrink rapidly, losing around three feet a year. Unfortunately, the recession of the salt water allows freshwater to flow into underground layers of earth near the shoreline. The freshwater dissolves the salt brines in these areas, creating underground cavities capable of collapsing into themselves at any moment. There’s no consistent way to predict when or where the earth will crumble. The largest sinkholes can be spotted outside Ein Gedi, near Masada, and are causing strain on agriculture and tourism. Human activity is not the only thing at risk. Although the Dead Sea’s water is too salty to sustain anything more complex than a microbe, the oases along its shore support a complex ecosystem of plants and animals. As the Dead Sea recedes, the springs that feed these oases are also at risk of disappearance. Although the sinkholes continue to open, in December 2013, Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority signed on to a $900 million public works project to combat the Dead Sea’s diminishment. A new desalination plant in the Jordanian port of Aqaba on the Red Sea, will provide fresh water for all parties, and the brine produced as a result will be transported via a 110 mile pipeline to replenish the Dead Sea.

99,The Austrian Hospice,"Jerusalem, Israel",This unassuming oasis elevated just above the busy streets of Jerusalem offers one of the best views of the Old City.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-austrian-hospice,"Walking through the Old City of Jerusalem is an exhilarating but overwhelming experience. Hurried teens pushing tiny wooden carts filled to the brim with dates and nuts, local shoppers, tourists, priests, rabbis, imams, and merchants throng the streets. Visitors and Jerusalemites alike often search for a place to cool off and escape the noise and crowd. One of the best places to do so is at the Austrian Hospice. Though the name may sound rather grim, the Austrian Hospice is actually a 19th-century guesthouse that originally catered to Austrian and German visitors in Jerusalem. Unassuming from the outside, the building’s charming interior is the perfect place for a short siesta from exploring the area’s myriad historical and religious sites. Better yet, its roof offers what is arguably the best view of the Old City. From the roof, you can see the Dome of the Rock, the Armenian Church of Our Lady of the Spasm, and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, all of which make for a strikingly unique skyline. Even the Mount of Olives—including the golden onion domes of the Russian Orthodox Monastery and the many headstones of the ancient Jewish Cemetery—is visible from this vantage point. After taking in the cityscape, it’s worth spending some time exploring the rest of the building. Founded in 1854 by the Archbishop of Vienna, the Austrian Hospice still hosts guests, but has also become a favorite with locals, owing to its Viennese-style cafe, replete with a chandelier and burgundy upholstered chairs. If you need to refresh yourself before hitting the Old City’s bustling streets again, order an iced coffee. Deceptively named, it’s actually coffee that has been thoroughly blended with a dash of milk and topped with a generous helping of rich, freshly made whipped cream. If you’re in the mood for something more substantial, you can’t go wrong with their apfelstrudel. Another must-see is the tiny but opulent Austrian Catholic chapel, which still holds the occasional mass in German. Before you leave, walk along the hall just below the rooftop—it’s home to an art exhibit, which rotates every year. By the time you’ve taken in all there is to see, you’ll be refreshed and ready to brave the bustling streets again.  You have to buzz on the door for them to let you in. Entrance is free, but bring a little cash for the cafe and for access to the rooftop (credit cards aren't yet accepted). It costs 5 shekels to access the rooftop - coin/cash only.",oasis panoramas coffee places to stay history

Normally this is not a problem, and the collection of the National Library of Israel is unrivaled in the world for its collection of Hebraica and Judaica. But on occasion, collecting everything published in Israel makes for some awkward moments. Case in point, the library’s hidden collection of “stalags” or nazi themed porno paperbacks, created and written by Israeli authors and consumed by Israeli teenagers in the 1960s. Stalags were a short lived phenomenon, only lasting a handful of years before being made illegal. Curiously, they reached the height of their popularity during the famous Eichmann trial. Originally said to simply be translations of English authors, on closer inspection the genre seems to have been fully Israeli. Almost the only pornographic material available, it was purchased by teenagers, often the children of Holocaust survivors. The plots usually involved female SS officers (non-existent in the actual WWII) hell-bent on punishing a male, generally American or English, hero imprisoned in her Stalag of pain/pleasure. These books were also heavily influenced by the 1955 book “The House of Dolls” by K. Tzetnik, an anonymous survivor of Auschwitz who wrote about women prisoners forced into prostitution by the Nazi guards. Though received well in the 1950s, the book was later said to be fictional, and has since been recast and is thought of as a precursor to the “Stalag” books. A particularly famous Stalag was “I Was Colonel Schultz’s Private Bitch” which caused such an uproar that all the copies of the books were confiscated by the police. After two years of high popularity the stalag books were made illegal and largely disappeared from Israeli society , unless of course you go to the National Library of Israel where held in a back room, not available to the public (though accessible if you are a researcher) are copies of “I Was Colonel Schultz’s Private Bitch” and many other Stalags, examples of the many strange ways in which culture handles and mixes tragedy, violence and sex into new and strange brews.

The largest of the three tells, Tel Hazor occupies over 200 acres just north of the Sea of Galilee and has yielded some of the most impressive archaeological finds from the ancient Near East to date. Of particular note are both the Canaanite Orthostat and Stele Temples, as well as the Solomonic gate system dating to the Iron Age. Much of Hazor’s fame is directly tied to the conquest narrative found in the book of Joshua, where the Israelites are said to have burned the Canaanite city to the ground. While many archaeologists doubt the historical authenticity of these claims, there is little question that the Canaanite city was one of the grandest of its time. Today, tourists can explore the majority of the Upper City, which includes the Solomonic city gates, a restored Late Bronze Age temple, and the city acropolis. Moreover, excavations are still held annually each summer and are open to the public pending fees and applications - and of course the ability to withstand early mornings, hard work, and the Israeli sun.

The commission believed that the warped, vaguely bovine installation would be too scary for children. Teddy Kollek, the popular mayor of Jerusalem who had commissioned the piece, asked the commission to vote again, and for de Saint Phalle to make a case for fear. In a 1988 interview with The Los Angeles Times, she explained that she argued for the foundational value of something frightening in a place that is safe. When presented appropriately, the avant-garde artist insisted, “[s]cary things are good because they help children conquer their fears.” The commission greenlit the sculpture and soon realized their trepidation was misplaced. Since its 1972 installation in the Kiryat HaYovel neighborhood’s Rabinovich Park, the distorted colossus has been wholeheartedly embraced by local children, who climb a twisting staircase along the sculpture’s back in order to slide down one of its three red tongues.

103,Beit She'arim Necropolis,"Kiryat Tiv'on, Israel",A sprawling ancient Jewish cemetery with over 30 rock-hewn burial caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beit-shearim-necropolis,"The Roman destruction of Jerusalem’s Second Temple in 70 CE scattered the Jewish people out into the empire, from the Greek islands to as far as modern-day Spain and Portugal. Following this cataclysmic event, Jerusalem’s great assembly of the Sanhedrin, a sort of Supreme Court of the Jewish nation, migrated north to the Galilean city of Bet She’arim. There’s not much left of the city itself in what is now Beit She’arim National Park. At its peak in the 2nd century, however, the city was a thriving center of rabbinical Judaism. Rabbi Judah the Prince, compiler of the Mishna (a written compilation of Jewish oral tradition), made his home in Beit She’arim, assisted by a land grant from his childhood friend, the philosopher emperor Marcus Aurelius. But rather than the scattered remains of the city, what most fascinates visitors to the park is the sprawling, rock-hewn necropolis in which Rabbi Judah is buried. More than 30 burial caves, carved into soft, white limestone, comprise what is the world’s largest ancient Jewish cemetery. The existence of tombs inscribed to deceased persons from as far away as Palmyra (in modern-day Syria) and Himyar (modern-day Yemen) attest to Beit She’arim’s status among the Jewish diaspora. The fact that Judah the Prince chose the site as his resting place rather than the Mount of Olives, where any devout Jew of means would have traditionally preferred to be buried, must have raised the site’s prominence. A three-arched façade guards the entrance of Beit She’arim’s most impressive site, the Cave of the Coffins. Contained herein are 135 decorated coffins, as well as wall carvings, such as a human-sized sculpture of a menorah, and inscriptions in Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Palmyrene. For the Jews of Beit She’arim, the commandment of the Torah, “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,” was conspicuously relaxed. Adorning many of these tombs are images of lions, eagles, fish, even a dreaded calf, along with scenes from pagan mythology, such as Leda and the Swan. Experts believe presence of this imagery simply illustrates that the tolerant Jews of Beit She’arim were immersed in the Hellenistic majority culture of the time, and would have considered these figurative representations a sign of a person’s prestige, not an offense to their faith. Elsewhere on the site are the remains of an Abbasid-era glassmaking facility, as well as a poem from the same time written by the poet Umm al-Qasim, which indicates the necropolis was still in use during Muslim rule, during which time the city was known as Sheikh Ibreik.",judaism tombs burial places rocks caves ancient religion archaeology cemeteries ecosystems geology sacred spaces ruins

It also boasts Israel’s only underground metro, which makes up in elevation change what it lacks in other metrics. Opened in 1959, the Carmelit climbs from the Mediterranean shore to the top of Mount Carmel. It was intended to provide quick and easy transit between the commercial districts along Haifa’s waterfront and the modern residential center of the city, which was situated atop the heights of the mountain for which the line is named. Serving six stations, from Paris Square at sea level to Gan Ha’em at the mountain’s peak, the Carmelit ascends 274 meters (899 feet) over the course of its 1.8 kilometer (1.1 mile) run. Since the time of its completion, much of Haifa’s population has shifted to other parts of the city, leaving the Carmelit lightly used in the present day.

In the 1980s, she and her husband bought a 300-year-old building in Jaffa and began the process of restoring it to its original glory. It is now a modern-day curio cabinet full of artistic wonders, a secret world hidden on a Jaffa side street. The historic building was first constructed in 1742 as an inn for Jewish pilgrims to the holy land. Over the centuries, it served as a soap factory, a synagogue, and an apartment building. At the time Goor purchased it, it had been largely neglected. The couple transformed it piece by piece into the gallery that stands today. Goor designed everything herself, down to the door handles. In 1995, the museum finally opened. It’s a unique hybrid of art museum and home, as the couple lives in a private apartment above the museum. Much of the art is Goor’s own work, displayed alongside her eclectic collection of art from all over the world. The collection spans from Roman times to the present day, and art is still being added all the time. The sculpture garden on the museum rooftop offers incredible views of Jaffa and the Mediterranean Sea.

106,Elvis American Diner,"Neve Ilan, Israel","In a small town outside Jerusalem, a roadside diner is devoted to all things Elvis Presley.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elvis-american-diner,"Every January 8, flamboyantly-costumed fans flock to a diner beside a gas station in the small town of Neve Ilan, Israel. They arrive, clad in gaudy shirts with wide-open necks, stick-on sideburns, and puffy, black wigs. They’re here to pay tribute to Elvis Presley on the legendary singer’s birthday. And they’ve come to the right place: Everything about the Elvis American Diner, located about 12 miles outside Jerusalem, celebrates the performer known to many as simply “the King.” The diner hosts performances from Elvis impersonators both on Presley’s birthday and on August 16, the day he died. But visitors are welcome to come, eat, and admire its unique collection throughout the year. The place is covered in more than 700 pieces of Elvis memorabilia, from photos to posters to giant statues. The jukebox is filled with Presley’s hits ranging from “Heartbreak Hotel” to “Jailhouse Rock.” The collection belongs to the restaurant’s owner, Uri Yoeli. The Jerusalem native became a fan of the King as a teenager and has been slowly amassing his collection ever since. His diner, however, wasn’t always an Elvis shrine. Known as the “Mountain Inn Truck Stop” when it opened in 1974, it displayed a few of Yoeli’s photos of his favorite singer. Gradually, it became informally known as the “Elvis Inn.” Yoeli was all too happy to embrace this new identity more officially, renaming the restaurant the Elvis American Diner. The menu offers a mix of Israeli and American fare, including hummus, tomato-and-cucumber salads, burgers, and fries. Most visitors describe the food as fair, but the diner’s still a fine place to stop for a snack and a song or two.

107,Mount Arbel,"Hamaam, Israel",An iconic view point of the Sea of Galilee offers a look into Israel's past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-arbel,"Mount Arbel’s height is only 180 meters but is one of the most famous mountains in Israel. It rises very steeply, 380 meters from the Sea of Galilee and is considered by many the best view-point around the lake. From the summit, there is an amazing vista that includes most of the Galilee mountains, the Golan Heights and famous landmarks like Tiberias, Safed and the Horns of Hattin. But it’s not only the views. The mountain has a very long human history. In the northern cliffs, the Arbel fortress is built into the mountain. The fortification that is carved into the rocks were built by the Galilean Jews, who barricaded themselves at Arbel in 37 BCE. The Roman commander, Herod was sent to suppress the rebellion. His army overcame the rebels only after he had the best of his warriors lowered to the caves in cages suspended by ropes, from which the rebels became convenient targets. About two kilometers west of the summit, you can find the beautiful ruins of an ancient synagogue that dates to the 4th century. It was built from large limestone blocks in the center of the ancient Arbel village. The synagogue is believed to have been used continuously until the 8th century. Two kilometers west rising from the plane is the “Horns of Hattin,” an extinct volcano with twin peaks overlooking the Arbel summit. The spot is believed to be the site of the Battle of Hattin, between the Crusader of the Levant and the forces of Sultan Salah ad-Din, which took place in July 1187.  A very popular hiking trail climbs from the Sea of Galilee to the Arbel Summit via the fortress and descends back via the ancient synagogue.",
108,Caesarea Maritima Mithraeum,"Caesarea, Israel",An ancient underground cultic temple where sunlight penetrates on the summer solstice.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/caesarea-maritima-mithraeum,"In Caesarea Maritima you can dive in the Mediterranean Sea and explore the underwater archaeological remains of one of the ancient world wonders, the harbor built by Herod—yes, that Herod—in 13 BC. The city of Caesarea was the wealthy and cosmopolitan capital of the Roman province of Judaea. There, Jews, Samaritans, Romans, Greeks, and Syrians lived and did business more or less pacifically for centuries, before the city was conquered and destroyed. In the 1970s, an underground vaulted room near the port was discovered by a team of archaeologists—one of several similar structures that were probably originally built as warehouses. This one, however, was special: During the end of the first century or beginning of the second century CE, it was converted into the temple of the god Mithras. This god, originally worshiped in Persia and neighboring countries, was a recent import in the Roman world, but the mysterious cult rapidly acquired a vast popularity throughout the entire empire, in particular among the soldiers. Temples of Mithras, often called Mithraea, are found from Egypt to England, from Crimea to Portugal, and especially on the legion headquarters along the Roman borders. Most Mithraea are underground or excavated in the rock, so as to represent the mythical grotto in which the god was supposed to be born. They all look alike: a simple, small vaulted room with two benches on the side for the adepts. In the central niche is an altar supporting a relief with the central scene of the cult: Mithras stabs the primordial Bull with a dagger, while some animals—a dog, a scorpion, and a snake, probably representing the constellations— take active part. Mithras was also identified with the Sun and with Apollo in the syncretistic atmosphere of late paganism. While the archaeologists were working on their discovery, they noted a shaft in the vault, from which sunlight shone at midday near the altar. As the days went by, the light ray came closer and closer to the altar, until it shone directly on it on June 21st, the summer solstice. According to the philosopher Porphyry, who probably visited Caesarea in his youth and later married a Caesarean woman, the Mithraists believed that the soul entered the human body at birth and left it at death following the direction of the solstice. The Caesarea Mithraeum was then a faithful representation of the mythical cosmos! In addition, the direction of the sunset on the summer solstice as seen from Caesarea has an extraordinary property: it passes almost exactly through the small island of Delos in the Aegean Sea, the legendary birthplace of Apollo, and through Delphi, the famous Apollinean oracular center not far from Athens. Further on, it passes through an impressive string of ancient cultic places devoted to the archangel Michael: San Michele del Gargano, Tempio di San Michele in Perugia, San Galgano, Sacra di San Michele della Chiusa, Mont Saint Michel, St. Michael’s Mount, Skellig Michael, and others. In fact, in ancient Christianity Michael was often invoked and worshiped in places where Mithraea have been found, as in Sutri, Heidelberg, Riegel, and many others. Michael killing the Dragon and protecting the souls serves much the same function as Mithras killing the Bull and giving directions to the souls entering and leaving mortality.",mithras solstice summer cults paganism mythology underground temples subterranean sites ancient religion archaeology sacred spaces
109,Tisch Family Zoological Park,"Jerusalem, Israel",Biblical beasts and endangered animal preservation come together in this Israeli zoo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tisch-family-zoological-park,"While the current Tisch Family Zoological Park has been providing visitors with a glimpse of the creatures of the Bible since 1993, its roots began decades earlier. The large zoological center now known as the Tisch Family Zoological Park or simply the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo by the locals, originally began as the small passion project of a Jewish scholar who wanted to help people experience the Bible as reality as opposed to simply in the abstract. Aharon Shulov was a professor of zoology Jerusalem’s Hebrew University when he started his original children’s zoo in 1940. The small collection of animals were all creatures that had been named in the Bible, displayed in a public street. However due to complaints from neighbors, Shulov’s collection had to be moved to a new location. Thus began a series of moves for the collection that lasted until the early 90’s when the expanding menagerie landed in its current home in Jerusalem. Today the 62 acre site continues Shulov’s dream to bring the animals of the Bible to the public as well as a new focus on endangered species. The park contains over 140 different species across its two main sections, the Biblical and the Endangered. Horses, monkeys, lions, exotic birds, frogs, snakes, fish, and countless other beasts are on display, giving both a religious and conservationist viewpoint to the exhibits. Species that are extinct in Israel are even bred in captivity to help repopulate their numbers.",religious parks biblical zoos animals
110,Prophet Samuel's Tomb,"Nabi Samwil, Israel","This ancient tomb in the West Bank is a holy site for Jews, Muslims, and Christians alike.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prophet-samuels-tomb,"This tomb, located in a synagogue below a mosque built atop the ruins of a church, is considered a holy site by Muslims, Jews, and Christians alike. It’s believed to be the final resting place of the great prophet Samuel, an important figure in the Old Testament and the Quran. Located on a hilltop in the West Bank village of Nabi Samwil, just north of the Jerusalem neighborhood of Ramot, the site is a place where Jews and Muslims both come to worship, and do so peacefully. The hilltop offers stunning views of the surrounding area, including the city of Jerusalem off in the distance. The tomb is also a popular place for Jewish families to bring their three-year-old sons, often on the 28th day of Iyar on the Jewish calendar, for upsheren, the traditional first haircut for males at the age when they start to wear payots (sidelocks). (The prophet Samuel was a nazir, someone who had taken a vow never to cut his hair.) The mosque on the hill was built in 1730 out of what had been a Crusader-era fortress and church from 1099. It is believed that it was from that mountaintop that the Crusaders first saw Jerusalem. It is also believed that the Crusaders may have been the ones who brought Samuel’s remains to the hill from another location. The fortress was destroyed by the Mamelukes in the 12th century. At the end of the 19th century, a Jewish village was established on the hillside, though it was later abandoned as it became a dangerous place to live. In 1917, it was the site of fighting between Ottoman Turks and the British, which resulted in the destruction of the mosque’s original minaret (it was rebuilt after World War I). After 1948, it became an Arab stronghold until 1967, used by the Jordanian Arab Legion to attack Jerusalem during that time. The prophet Samuel, according to the Bible, unified the tribes of the Israelites under a centralized kingdom after their victory over the Philistines during the Battle of Mizpah, which was said to have been on this site. He anointed Saul and later David as the first kings of Israel, following years of rule by judges—of which Samuel, a student of Eli, High Priest of Shiloh, was the last. The hilltop of Nabi Samwil may or may not be the true final resting place of the biblical prophet. He was said to have never ventured far from his hometown of Ramah, but since Ramah is known to have been in the vicinity of this hill and is a Hebrew word for “heights,” many firmly believe the prophet was buried on this site. Others consider it to be a memorial shrine rather than literal tomb. Today a national park surrounds the site of the tomb, as does rubble from the Six-Day War of 1967. The Jewish National Initiative has started working on restoring the site, feeling it has fallen into a state of neglect.",synagogues mosques islam jewish tombs

Originally built in in the 1840’s in West Virginia by a Scottish immigrant, the rustic cabin was subsequently purchased by a local Jewish man by the name of Allen Radley. The original cabin sat on the historic Appalachian Trail and when Israel developed the Israel National Trail (INT) based on the sprawling American hiking path, Radley saw an opportunity. In order to give the comparatively new trail a feel for its inspiration, Radley dismantled the old cabin and shipped the whole building piecemeal to the village of Allon Hagalil. After keeping the broken down building in storage for a number of years, Radley oversaw its reconstruction at the Yiftah’el Winery as their new visitor’s center, even helping to physically reconstruct the cabin. Today the oak and chestnut cabin houses a small store and information center on its first floor. Visitors can purchase the wine and honey that is produced in the vineyard and learn about its cultivation and creation. The second floor is used as a rotating gallery space that houses the work of local artists.

The ruins of Caesarea, sometimes referred to as Caesarea Maritima to distinguish it from Caesarea Philippi, lie on the Mediterranean coast of present-day Israel. The city was founded between 22 and 10 BCE by Herod the Great. When construction began, Caesarea had no reliable source of fresh water, so King Herod commissioned a raised aqueduct to deliver water from springs about ten miles to the northeast. In 130 CE, Roman Emperor Hadrian visited Caesarea on his tour of the eastern part of the empire and noted the city’s need for additional water. He commissioned extensive repairs to the aqueduct and constructed a new section to the west of Herod’s section. Known as the High-level Aqueduct II, Hadrian’s section doubled the capacity of Herod’s channel. These twin parallel aqueducts continued to supply water for about 1,200 years. Caesarea thrived as an urban center and harbor throughout the late Roman and Byzantine eras. Today, the site of the Hadrianic Aqueduct is a large national park.  The best and easiest place to see the aquaduct is at Caesarea on the beach.

It was this group of religious devotees who established the meteorological station at the site in 1919. With its roots as an agricultural school, the study of and prediction of the weather must have seemed like a necessary and underserved area of interest to the early 20th century monks.

While the YMCA organization has had an Israeli presence since the 1800’s it was not until the opening decades of the 20th century that its current incarnation was established. This was thanks to the efforts of one Dr. Archibald Harte. The good doctor made it his later life’s work to create a YMCA in Jerusalem that was not only large enough to service the entire city but also a non-discriminatory public center for any of the population’s conflicting religions. After seven years of construction, Harte’s vision was completed in 1933, on the occasion of which Harte dedicated the center with the words, “Here is a spot whose atmosphere is peace, where political and religious jealousies can be forgotten and international unity be fostered and developed.” The center itself is a large, architecturally iconic building with a large central tower that rises well above the surrounding buildings. It is outfitted with all of the modern fitness amenities and still offers low priced hotel services.

Built into the facade of the central community building in Sarona, the decorative carillon clock hearkens to the community’s European roots. While there were at one time a number of clocktowers across Israel, the Sarona clock was placed in a central position in the community like a number of similar clocks all across structures in Germany and the UK. The timepiece was central to the area’s daily life in the time before personal watches and clocks were ubiquitous. Over the decades, the clock stopped working and no one seemed too concerned about its restoration. The building and its clock were finished in 1871 but as the area changed and the surrounding city of Tel Aviv grew, the structures erected by the Sarona community had to be moved and restored. It was during such a restoration in 2005 that workers discovered the clock’s old iron mechanism. The clockworks were given over to one of the only remaining clock repairmen in Israel who was more than happy to restore such a unique piece. After discovering the name of the original craftsmen etched into the gears, the restorers were able to contact the German company (which was miraculously still in business), and they donated a brand new modern clock for the building.

Before DVDs, there were Walkmans. Before Walkmans, there were cassette players. Before cassettes, vinyl, and before vinyl, Edison wax cylinders. But according to Nissan Cohen, owner and curator at the Nisco Museum, what came before all of these was by far more magnificent: intricate machines that played live music. These charming, beautifully crafted instruments could be called “music boxes.” But if you’re thinking of little cranked ballerinas spinning to “Happy Birthday,” think again. With its extensive collection of these machines, the Nisco Museum is a place of enchantment that will bring you into a bygone world of large, unbelievably complex wonders of sound and sight. The very name of the museum—Nisco, short for Nissan Cohen—hints at the fact that this is a personal project of a passionate collector who loves sharing his lifelong assembling of antique music-making instruments. The museum is located in the hills overlooking the Mediterranean Sea in a large building at the entrance to the quaint Israeli artist village, Ein Hod. You enter through the small gift shop, which gives no hint at what awaits you just a few steps below: a large hall filled with hundreds of carefully selected examples of the art, science, and technology involved in creating the mechanical music that flourished from the mid-1800s to 1900. The museum collection includes everything from hurdy gurdies to automatic organs and pianos. Everywhere you turn in this dizzying musical mine, you find yet another example of the human need to have music always close by. Often the music is accompanied by a display of mechanical automata in the form of animals, humans, and dolls. The Nisco’s most impressive piece is the work of another mechanical-music aficionado, Arthur Prinsen. A musician and composer from Belgium, Prinsen brought the old art of mechanical organ-playing from punched books well into the 20th century. Cohen acquired Prinsen’s huge 84-key mechanical organ—named Primar—in Belgium and lovingly reassembled it in Ein Hod. Its rich, immense sound will resonate with you long after you bid farewell to Cohen and thank him for sharing his resurrection of reverberations from long ago and his passion for music magic with you.

Beginning in 2006 the medical clowning program began being offered through Haifa University’s drama school, although the focus is just as much on psychology and healing as it is on theatrical skills. Treating the field as a serious area of study requiring training and critical thought, the school looks for students who might naturally have an affinity for medical clowning and provides them with a course of academic study focusing on drama therapy, nursing, psychology, and the performing arts. The clowns coming out of the Haifa program will not only have a solid grasp of how to draw healthy laughs from patients, but also a firm grasp of how and why such levity is important, which is much more than can be said for most comedians. Enrollment in the program is not yet huge, but this has not stopped the program from spearheading a number of world-first initiatives. In 2012 (with an enrollment of around 30 students in the program proper), Haifa hosted the world’s first international medical clowning seminar drawing hospital hucksters from around the world. In addition the program works with another Israeli group known as the “Dream Doctors” which serves to place medical clowns in positions in Israeli hospitals.

So serious, she made her husband stand nearby with a ruler as she rolled the dough, just to make sure everything was measured exactly right. The meticulousness paid off: Ida’s nut rolls were so beloved by her family that when she died, they inscribed that very recipe on her tombstone. Visitors to Rehovot Cemetery can see Ida’s recipe on the grave she shares with her husband, Isaiah. The recipe might seem simple: It consists of applying a mixture of strawberry jam, ground pecans, and cinnamon sugar to dough, then rolling it up, baking it, and slicing into pieces. But, to hear her children tell it, Ida’s care made each batch special. “She had ‘golden hands,’” says her son, Yossi, who still makes the treat today. Even for non-Hebrew speakers, the Kleinmans’ grave is easy to spot because it bears another unique engraving: a harmonica, in remembrance of Isaiah, who passed away in 2013. This symbol is yet one more poignant piece of the Kleinman family story. Isaiah was a passionate, skilled musician, who attributed his harmonica with giving him the strength to survive the Holocaust. In addition to the personal importance of their parents’ memorial, the Kleinmans’ children have enjoyed sharing their story with the world. After visiting the grave, Yossi sometimes stands nearby to watch others experience it. One person might take note of the recipe and smile. Another might even take out a sheet of paper and copy it down. “This is what we wanted it to be,” he says. “People walk by and smile a little.”",cookies recipe graveyards gravestones cemeteries food

In addition to receiving more sun than any other place in the country, Israel’s arid Negev desert is as dry a place as any on the planet and the country’s solar energy center looks to make that an advantage. Using cutting-edge technology to capture ever more efficient amounts of the sun’s rays, the center believes that they may be able to one day provide 90% of the country’s power off of renewable solar energy alone, provided a suitable and cost-effective storage system for electricity is found. The center is also working on the development of such batteries. The center’s researchers have developed novel optics both for hot water systems and concentrating photovoltaic devices and are working on improving efficiencies of solar cells, both high performance solar cells and low cost (but low efficiency) organic solar cells. In addition to garnering power that is clean and efficient, the center and other companies like it in the area are changing the way that solar energy is distributed and in turn changing the lives of those who use it. Solar panels have been set up in a number of Bedouin villages across the desert area providing power to people who have never before had access to it. This in turn is helping these people put down roots in their settlements, moving away from their traditionally nomadic existence.

However, due to prime minister David Ben Gurion’s fear of the Irgun, there was a fallout with its leader Menachem Begin. He refused to hand the weapons over to the government. In retaliation, the ship was shelled once it reached a shallow Tel Aviv beach. In that fight, 16 Irgun fighters died, as well as three IDF soldiers. The ship sank and its cargo was lost.

125,Red Sea Star,"Eilat, Israel",Underwater restaurant at the coral reefs of Eilat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/red-sea-star,"There are few places to dine where the table next to you is a colorful school of fish passing, and a window next to your silverware leads out to the Red Sea. Each table of the restaurant has two large windows, one at its side, and one above the table. At night, the coral gardens around the Red Sea Star are softly illuminated with a light, designed not to disturb the fragile eco-system. The Red Sea Star is a combination of two areas, one above and one below the surface. Above the surface, there is the Metro Bar, which offers great views of the Gulf of Aqaba. Below the surface, the underwater area roughly resembles the shape of a star, hence the name of the place. Besides an underwater restaurant, the complex also holds an underwater bar with a similar decoration, including a floor covered in sand to complete the sea experience. Ten years ago, when it was created, it was the world’s first and only underwater restaurant. Although its design is probably a bit over-the-top in its “under the sea“ theme, it nevertheless remains one of the most unique restaurants in Israel.

126,Petra,Jordan,"An ancient capital city that dates back 3,000 years old and harbors many surprises.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/petra,"Built sometime between 1550 and 1292 BC as a capital city for the Nabataeans, a Semitic people, Petra is perhaps one of the most astonishing wonders of the ancient world. It lay undiscovered to the modern Western world until 1812. But postcard images of the Treasury, the Monastery, and the water channels in the Siq (approach canyon) can’t convey the wonders to be experienced there in person. From the awe-inspiring arrival to the overpowering geology (endless towering, convoluted rocks) and enormous scale (hundreds of monumental-geological tombs, going on for miles), Petra is an incredible site. The approach takes almost an hour on foot, or you can go by horse or carriage. Before one enters the Siq (which translates to “shaft,” and is the narrow gorge entrance to the city of Petra), a few scattered rock tombs give a preview of what’s to come. Huge cubical forms cut out of vivid sandstone, cliff faces sculpted smooth and vertical, with spare bas relief motifs of five ascending steps and Greek-column forms, and abyssal black tomb-openings. The Siq itself is a canyon as narrow, high, extravagant, and anxiety-inducing as the slot canyons of the American Southwest. You enter from the top and walk down a gentle slope. On each side of the narrow, flood-sculpted passageway is a waist-high ancient water channel carved along the cliff curves. One channel was used for agriculture, the other to offer water to people and animals. It is conspicuously brilliant hydrology. As you walk, you begin to see Petra’s architectural elements—carved niches almost worn away, bench forms, a watering trough for animals, and, recently discovered, the feet and legs of a realistically sculpted man leading two camels down the Siq, just larger than life-size. When you finally arrive at the Treasury framed at the end of the Siq, the scale seems all wrong. The Treasury is as beautifully shaped, well preserved, and sandy pink as expected, but it is not jewel-like at all. It towers up over you, and a day of awe-induced neck-craning begins. Inside, the large entrance is a vast, perfect cube of space inside the mountain. The ceiling is not arched but absolutely horizontal, 50 feet by 50 feet. The Treasury is truly amazing, a revelation, but without the Siq leading down to it, it would be merely impressive. Once into Petra the city begins, first a lengthy necropolis of tombs in the widening canyon, then signs of the once-living metropolitan area of 30,000 people. The tombs vie with each other for massiveness, reaching far up the mountains on each side, crowding and overlapping — a teeming, almost overpopulated necropolis. The natural rock landscape is so extensively carved, and so much of the carving has eroded to look natural, that your eyes can’t stop examining every rock surface near and far, parsing artificial from natural and delighting the more in both. There are modern amenities in this ancient city, provided by resident Bedouin children and adults. Coffee, camel rides in the canyon, burro rides to the peaks, and books sold by a woman originally from New Zealand who married into the Petra Bedouin are all available. Past ever grander tombs, a Roman colonnade, a Byzantine church (discovered in 1992), and a huge free-standing temple, is lunch and a museum. A few miles away and very much worth visiting is “Little Petra,” the fountainhead of the whole Nabatean complex—a hydrological masterpiece of water channels, stone stairways, huge echoing cisterns, and dwelling caves. A hymn of water and rock, ancient and modern, dead and living—ultimately, Petra is an indescribable place. In conjunction with the Long Now Foundation.

127,Little Petra,"Petra District, Jordan",A more chill but no less fascinating version of the famous ancient archeological site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/little-petra,"Also known as Siq al-Barid, “Little Petra,” located about eight miles north of the ruins of the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, is a smaller but no less fascinating archeological site. Like Petra senior, Little Petra was built by the Nabateans, and is widely believed to be a suburb of the ancient city, acting as a post on the silk road. Within Little Petra is a room dug into the mountainside in true Petra-style commonly referred to as The Painted House. It contains a recently restored 2,000-year old Nabatean fresco, depicting grapes and small, chubby, male children (dubbed Putti in art jargon). While Little Petra is often recommended as a more relaxed version of Petra, this ancient painting has no parallels in its larger neighbour, making the extra trip worthwhile for those interested in art, archeology, or paintings of small chubby children.",ancient archaeology
128,The Ruins of Jerash,"Jerash, Jordan",Gladiators battle and chariots race daily in the ruins of a once-great Roman city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ruins-of-jerash-jerash-jordan,"There are a few places in the world where one has the opportunity to see history re-inacted, but only in the ancient hippodrome of Jerash can you witness chariots race or gladiators in full regalia clash on the site where Roman athletes and warriors one walked and fought. Hidden for hundreds of years under the shifting sands of Jordan, picturesque ruins are all that remains of a once-great ancient city that saw the likes of Alexander the Great, the emperors Trajan and Hadrian, and the mathematician Nichomachas. Most of the ancient city of Gerasa was destroyed in an earthquake in 749 AD, leading to comparisons to another great Roman city: Pompeii. The ruins were re-discovered in 1806 by German explorer Ulrich Jasper Seetzen. Today it is one of the best preserved Roman cities in the Middle East, and is a popular destination for those who would like to witness the majesty of Roman architecture, marvel at extraordinarily well preserved mosaics and carvings, and to see full-speed horse-drawn chariot races. The Jerash Heritage Company puts on daily spectacles known as the “Roman Army and Chariot Experience”, with 45 “legionaries” in showing off battle tactics in armor, gladiators battling, and a seven lap race in Roman chariots.",roman ruins
129,Hand of Hercules,"Amman, Jordan","The most gigantic, swoony, intimidating trio of fingers in all of antiquity.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hand-of-hercules,"Towering over Amman’s modern skyline is the Temple of Hercules, located at the peak of a hillside in one of the ancient city’s oldest quadrants. Constructed between 162-166 CE during Marcus Aurelius’ Roman occupation of Amman’s Citadel, the great temple is larger than any in Rome itself. Its portico faces east and is surrounded by six, 33-foot tall columns. Measuring 100 feet long by 85 feet wide, with an outer sanctum of 400 by 236 feet, the fact that the rest of the temple remained unadorned by columns suggests to scholars that the structure was never completed, for reasons history has yet to reveal. During the excavation process, few clues were left to help scholars unlock the mysteries of this massive half-finished, abandoned temple. But the ones that did exist were huge—albeit ambiguous. From just three gigantic fingers, one elbow, and a scattering of coins, archaeologists have agreed these marble body parts likely belonged to a massive statue of Hercules himself. Therefore, the theory goes, the temple also must have been dedicated to the half-god known for his feats of strength and far-ranging adventures. Likely toppled during one of the area’s periodic catastrophic earthquakes, the statue fell to bits, but unlike the temple, all except the hand and elbow disappeared. As one guide put it, “The rest of Hercules became Amman’s countertops.” Experts’ best guess is that, in its original state, the statue would have measured upwards of 40 feet high, which would have placed it among the largest known marble statues to have ever existed. Back in the here and now, it makes for a pretty enjoyable time to walk up to a cluster of fat fingers, stare at their well-trimmed nails and cuticles, and walk away giggling that scholars have agreed: Hercules enjoyed a good manicure, just like modern-day demigods.",temples ancient archaeology statues ruins
130,River Canyons of Jordan,"Areedh Sub-District, Jordan","Concentrated around the Dead Sea, these surprising canyons are filled with coursing water, fish, and even crabs.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/river-canyons-of-jordan-wadi-mujib,"Though water may not be what comes to mind at the mention of Jordan, the country is actually full of breathtaking water-filled slot canyons (“widyan” in Arabic) that make for incredible hiking, climbing, rappelling, and even fishing. The water originates in the west, bubbling forth from hot springs or from the increasingly rare melted winter snow, and rushes down towards the Dead Sea, the lowest point on Earth. Slowly yet unrelentingly, this water has chiseled through the rock. After millions of years, it has unveiled a stunning layer-cake alternation of burnt orange, tan, dusty pink, and beige-colored stone in places like Wadi Mujib; granite boulders and fire-colored walls in Wadi Zarqa Ma’in; and plainer, chalky sandstone walls in widyan such as Wadi Himara. In the winter and early spring, these canyons overflow with water, and it’s too dangerous to hike them. Come summer and fall, the water slows and they provide an unforgettable adventure and an opportunity to see wildlife found nowhere else in the country. If you examine the mossy crevices of the canyon walls, it’s entirely possible that you will see a freshwater crab clinging to the vegetation. Peer into the calmer parts of the water’s flow, and you might see fish flitting about, searching for a crunchy insect snack. At higher elevations closer to the sources of the widyan, mountain cats, ibex, and over 300 species of plants rely on the life-giving waters to invigorate what would otherwise be a sandy, rocky landscape. Indeed, the fertility of the land made possible by the moisture of even the drier widyan—in which the water never reaches more than a steady stream—provides sustenance to humans and wild animals alike. While less common than in previous decades, Bedouin still go to the widyan to hunt land animals, birds, and small fish. Hikers occasionally find small bullet casings on the ground, or see hunters and their children grilling the tiny birds or fish that they have caught. These lush canyons were as important to locals in the past as they are today. Some of them have even merited mention in ancient texts like the Bible. For instance, scholars have determined with reasonable certainty that Wadi Mujib is synonymous with what is referred to in the Old Testament as the River Arnon. If you push through to the end of the widyan trails, you’ll often be rewarded by a stunning waterfall. Wadi Mujib’s Siq Trail is probably the most famous example of this, but Wadi Hidan, Wadi Balou’, and Wadi Zarqa Ma’in are a few more of the many canyons dotted with stunning waterfalls. Timing is everything, and on a clear day, these areas prove that Mother Nature’s handiwork is on par with the manmade treasures of Petra and Jerash. In the sunlight, the mist that sprays up from the falls’ contact with the pool below looks like aerated diamond dust. It’s more than enough to make you forget that you’re in a country that is mostly desert.  The map coordinates above point to Wadi Mujib, Jordan's most well-known river canyon. There are many organized hikes through the canyons including the popular Siq Trail through Wadi Mujib. While exploring the widyan, take all necessary precautions—aside from Mujib and Hidan, most are not national or private, and thus lacking in safety infrastructure. Never go after a strong rain (avoid winters and early springs). Be sure to pack plenty of water, snacks, good shoes, and, if you're a weaker swimmer, a lifejacket for deeper widyan. It's always better to go with a guide, if possible.",hiking waterfalls deserts geological oddities water geology nature
131,Madaba Mosaic Map,"Madaba, Jordan",The world's oldest map of the holy land gives us a fragmented glimpse of the layout of biblical nations.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/madaba-mosaic-map,"Located in the Church of Saint George in Madaba, Jordan, the Madaba Mosaic Map is the world’s oldest glimpse into the cartography of the Middle East during biblical times. This tile map is the oldest known geographic floor mosaic in existence, depicting the Middle East during the height of the Byzantine period. Installed sometime during the late 6th century CE, much of the map’s tiles have been chipped away or been destroyed but a large contiguous piece of the map still exists illustrating both locations and names ranging from geographic features to cities. The mosaic covers lands from Egypt to Lebanon, including sites such as Bethlehem and Gethsemane, but the gem of the mosaic is the detailed representation of the city of Jerusalem. The Jerusalem portion of the map shows a number of specific structures and street in the city such as the Damascus Gate, the Church of The Holy Sephulchre, and the Tower of David. There are a number of recreations of the mosaic across the world, most of which are fittingly placed in the floor of a foyer, much like the original. There is one in a school in Bonn, as well as a copy in the floor of the YMCA in Jerusalem. The Madaba Map may not be complete, but it is still our most comprehensive overview of the biblical landscape.",mosaics maps
132,Wadi Rum,"Wadi Rum Village, Jordan","Known as the ""Valley of the Moon,"" this Jordanian wadi is one of the most amazing desertscapes on Earth.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wadi-rum,"When we think of the desert we normally imagine endless expanses of sand and dust. But the Wadi Rum desert valley in Jordan, also known as the “Valley of the Moon,” offers so much more. A journey to this ancient landscape is a journey to a vast, silent, and timeless place. In this arid valley, dug in a superb fashion by the water and the wind over the millennia, there are fabulous and unspoiled landscapes made of high sand dunes, rocky mountains with incredible shapes, narrow canyons with a thousand shades of color, water sources intertwined between the heights, impressive rock arches, 4,000-year-old rock engravings, and many other wonderful treasures. One of the area’s main attractions is the ruins of the house where, according to legend, T.E. Lawrence aka “Lawrence of Arabia” lived during the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in the First World War. Another historical site is the inscriptions of Anfaishiyya: Etchings depicting camels, warriors, and animals cover a stretch of the huge rock face, reminding us that these areas have been inhabited for millennia. Among the many natural wonders, a highlight is the Al-Hasany Dunes, the most spectacular sand dunes of Wadi Rum. Though they occupy a relatively small area, they rise for many feet accumulating against the slopes of the Jebel Umm Ulaydiyya mountain. Another is the Ain Ash-Shallalah, or “Lawrence’s Spring,” a cave in which water gushes from the lush vegetation above, while the inside is adorned with ancient carvings in Arabic and filled with the scent of mint. Also look out for the Burdah rock bridge, a spectacular 260-foot-high natural bridge that is truly breathtaking. For the bravest travelers, it is also possible to reach the summit. Wadi Rum is an ideal location for adventurers and off-roaders, with plenty of places to hike, climb, and trek. True climbers can test their skills by ascending Jordan’s highest mountain, Jabal Rum. A guide is recommended for the trip to the summit, and arrangements should be made previously at Rum village or at a tourist agency. Wadi Rum is a spectacularly scenic desert valley (wadi in Arabic) in southern Jordan, or valley of the moon, because of the unique landscape that nearly similar to that on the moon.This area of Jordan is quite isolated and largely inhospitable to settled life. The only permanent inhabitants are several thousand Bedouin nomads and villagers. There is no real infrastructure, leaving the area quite unspoilt. Apart from the Bedouin goat hair tents, the only structures are a few concrete shops and houses and the fort headquarters of the Desert Patrol Corps.  The main route to Wadi Rum is well marked and easily navigable both from the north (Amman) and south (Aqaba) on Desert Highway or King's Highway. Public transportation to the village is very difficult. Tourist agencies in all the main cities offer trips with or without a driver. In case you won't have a driver, renting a vehicle in general in Jordan is also easy (and it will be in many cases the low-cost solution). From the main crossing, the road extends about 35 kilometers through the desert. The meeting point is usually the Wadi Rum Visitor Center, indicated by the above map coordinates. It is located in the small village of Wadi Rum, which consists mainly of Bedouin tents, houses, and few shops.",dunes martian landscapes landscapes deserts rocks ancient natural wonders ecosystems geology nature
133,Roman Theater of Amman,"Amman, Jordan",This exceptionally well-preserved ancient marvel also houses a small museum dedicated to Jordanian folk tradition.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/roman-amphitheater,"Cairo, Rome, and Beijing are all cities where ancient monuments and ruins punctuate rows of modern storefronts and streets humming with cars and mopeds. While lesser-known, Amman is also such a city. Here in the Jordanian capital, the 6,000 seats of a 2nd-century Roman amphitheater stand testament to the significance of what was then known as Philadelphia, or “the city of brotherly love.” Commissioned by Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius, this northward-facing landmark is divided into three distinct sections from which ancient spectators watched plays and modern ones listen to concerts. Amman’s iconic amphitheater is, in fact, a perfect place to attend such events (discounting the steep and sometimes slippery stairs), because the Romans were masters of acoustics. There is a small marking between the stage and the seats, and if you stand on this spot and speak, your voice projects to the entire stadium. The superior sound is not the only hidden gem this archaeological wonder contains, however. On the side of the stage, a small door opens to the Jordan Museum of Popular Traditions, in which dozens of ceramics, traditional Bedouin clothing, jewelry, and trinkets sit on display. Behind the theater, the remains of the Temple of Hercules sits on a hill, heralding the bright Jordanian sun.

134,Ma'in Hot Springs,"Mkawer, Jordan",This cascade of mineral-rich hot springs and waterfalls is an oasis in the Jordanian desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/main-hot-springs,"Though its salutary effects aren’t as world-famous as those of the Dead Sea, Jordanians have long used the water bubbling and gushing throughout the Hamamat Ma’in (Ma’in Hot Springs) as a natural remedy for all manner of joint pain and skin conditions. Back when access to these thermal falls was unrestricted and free, locals used to brave the tortuous road from the cities to celebrate holidays with soaking and picnicking. Surrounded by palm trees and dramatic travertine formations resulting from the interaction of spring water and the atmosphere, Ma’in Hot Springs is a lush canyon paradise in otherwise dry environs. The entire complex is comprised of 16 springs, which, due to their proximity to a large fault and consequent exposure to subterranean lava fissures, are some of the hottest in Jordan, hovering between 140 and 180 degrees Fahrenheit. The water is what is known as “fossil groundwater,” and is rich in minerals. After gurgling up from the ground and crashing over escarpments, the flow eventually joins the Zarqa River, which itself is a tributary of the Jordan River. While a substantial swath of the hot springs has been cordoned off for guests of a fancy resort built on the premises, everyone can access the public section for an entrance fee. A number of terraced pools are situated flush against the cliffside and are continuously filled by the waterfalls and springs. Most people relax and steam in the pools, but it’s also not uncommon to see matriarchs congregated directly under the falls, chatting and laughing as the warm water washes over their heads and shoulders. These springs have been a revered part of the landscape for millennia. The entire mountainous stretch of land between the Dead Sea and Aqaba was referred to as “the land of Seir,” and the Bible includes references to the hot springs—of which there are approximately 109—founded therein. Many people believe that King Herod the Great himself enjoyed lounging in the therapeutic waters of the Ma’in Hot Springs, though this is difficult to verify. Whatever the case, there’s no doubt that these thermal springs have been important to many groups over the years.

135,Umbrella Staircases of Amman,"Amman, Jordan",An oasis of shade and color amidst the bustle of the old city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/umbrella-staircases-amman,"Downtown Amman, Jordan, has always been known for its staircases. According to legend the city was built on seven hills, although the present-day reality is that there are many more than seven! In this hilly place, the daily life of residents and visitors very often revolves around finding pedestrian staircases to shortcut between the vertically stacked neighborhoods of central old Amman. It can take more than an hour to go from Rainbow Street to the Grand Husseini Mosque by car; but on foot, via the network of staircases, you can make the same journey in just a few minutes. For many years there has been a tradition of decorating the city with bright graffiti (some of it even commissioned), and this includes many very colorfully painted staircases. A more recent phenomenon, however, is the umbrella-covered staircases: also colorful, shaded, and almost oasis-like amid the heat and bustle of old Amman. No one seems to remember which was the first, but now there are several umbrellas adorning the stairways throughout the old city. Some are seasonal, others are up all the time. There is one in the gold souks off of King Faysal Street. The most well-known is the staircase that leads up from Prince Muhammed Street up to the Zajal restaurant.  You can find the main (and best) umbrella staircase by simply searching for the Zajal restaurant and walking to it. Alternatively, as you look out toward the Prince Muhammed Street from Jafra Cafe the umbrella staircase is to your right, about 65 feet (20 meters).",umbrellas stairs graffiti cities
136,Qasr Amra,Jordan,"A bathhouse from the second Islamic Caliphate decorated with frescoes of constellations, pleasure gardens, and naked ladies.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qasr-amra,"Standing in the Jordanian desert some 50 miles east of Amman, Qasr Amra is one of several qusur or “desert castles” built under the Umayyad Caliphate and probably the best known extant example of these buildings characteristic of the Damascus-based dynasty. Most likely constructed somewhere between 723 and 743 by Walid Ibn Yazid (the future caliph Walid II), Qasr Amra was a small royal retreat consisting of an audience hall and baths. In addition to simply being a well-preserved Umayyad structure, Qasr Amra is particularly notable for the frescoes that adorn the interior walls and ceilings. The frescoes are significant because they provide a rare glimpse at a largely secular and transitional style of early Islamic art. Because the frescoes were painted near the beginning (relatively speaking) of the Islamic era, and under the Umayyads – whose power base was in Syria, rather than the Arabian peninsula – the frescoes are perhaps surprisingly figurative and display clear Byzantine and Persian influences, representing what one antiquarian described as “an artistic renaissance of Hellenistic art.” The subject matter varies by room. Scenes in the audience hall depict activities as hunting, eating fruit, drinking wine, and peeking at nude women. One panel in this room also shows six kings – the Byzantine Emperor, the Persian Shah, the Visigoth king of Spain, the Negus of Ethiopia, and two more who are most likely Turkic and Indian or Chinese rulers — all paying homage to the Caliph, with inscriptions in Arabic and Greek. Within the baths, the apodyterium (changing room) features animals doing human things, like playing music; the tepidarium (warm bath) is decorated with natural scenes and plants and trees, and more nude women; and the caldarium (hot bath) boasts a domed ceiling bearing the zodiac and various other constellations. The stellar imagery in the caldarium is particularly significant, as it is the earliest known example of the night sky being depicted on a non-flat surface. Though seemingly incongruous given the more abstract and geometric styles in later Islamic art, the frescoes of Qasr Amra were apparently in accordance with the medical opinions of contemporary Arab doctors, who believed bathing drained the bather of the three “vital principals” (the animal, the spiritual, and the natural) and that baths should be decorated to refresh these principals. The site also bears evidence of an accompanying defensive castle that no longer stands, as well as a sophisticated animal-powered hydraulic system that provided water to the baths and most likely irrigated a garden. Today, Qasr Amra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",islam paintings deserts castles

Built in 1924 by Abdul Rahman Madi, the space at 12 King Faisal Street serves as one of the finest reminders available of the architectural heritage of Old Amman. The building served as the Central Post Office for the Emirate Trans-Jordanian government until the late 1940’s. For a brief period it was home to an annex of the Ministry of Finance, but for 50 years, starting in 1948, the five airy rooms at 12 King Faisal Street were known as the Haifa Hotel. Then in 2001, with Amman in the midst of a period of rapid growth and redevelopment, the space caught the attention of Mamdouh Bisharat who recognized the space’s unique character at a time when historic casualties in the name of progress continue to be the norm. Known locally as the “Duke of Mukheiheh,” it was Bisharat’s private investment and championing of the home’s preservation that has made it the destination it is today. In the words of the man himself, “We cannot enjoy modernity, if we neglect our past and heritage”. Named “Duke” in honor of its benefactor, and “Diwan” in reference to the Arabic word for the room of the house always open to guests, the modern Duke’s Diwan has become a meeting place for creators and visionaries from near and far to convene in moments of artistic celebration and contemplation. Informal concerts and events take place in the five adjoining rooms and airy balcony, where easels are erected to signal the diwan’s greater purpose. Throughout the residence, much of the original decor from the 1920’s has been restored, including a vintage radio, the original freestanding stove, and period specific chairs. The walls are decorated with framed memorabilia of Haifa Hotel’s glory days when Amman was among the world’s most ancient newly-modern cities.

138,Iraq al-Amir,"Amman, Jordan",Just outside of Jordan's capital lies an ancient castle and intriguing caves dating back to the Copper Age.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iraq-al-amir,"Nestled among hills just outside of Amman in Wadi Al-Seer is a quaint village filled with ancient stone secrets. Iraq al-Amir, which means “Caves of the Prince” in Arabic, is home to more than 10 caves that have been inhabited by various groups since the Copper Age, as well as the ruins of an Ozymandian castle. One of these caves is lined with what appears to be seats, fit for a feast or a meeting; another has a more sepulchral appearance, divided by low stone walls into cubicles approximately the length of a supine adult; still another has a high ceiling over what appears to be carved walls, enclosing a spacious room that could have housed several families. While nobody permanently inhabits these caves anymore, shepherds do occasionally keep sheep or donkeys in them. These dark caverns are also home to numerous bats. Perhaps the most striking aspect of these caves is the large carved words adorning the entrances to two of the caves. Written in an early Hebrew script (some argue that it is Aramaic, but it is likely just an early, non-standardized Hebrew script) are blocky letters that spell “Toviyah.” This is a Hebrew name that translates to “God is good” (tov=good, yah=God). Many scholars postulate that this is a reference to the powerful Tobiad family, an Ammonite Jewish dynasty. Additional evidence supporting this theory lies just a short walk down the hill from these caves. Nearby Qasr al-‘Abed (“Palace of the Slave” in Arabic) was built by Hyrcanus, the governor of Ammon in the 2nd century BCE. Some people speculate that “slave” refers to Hyrcanus’s role in public service, which rendered him a “slave to the people.” Others believe that it references his subservience to the king; after all, during that time, what is now Jordan was caught in the power struggle between the Seleucids and Ptolemies. In any case, there are some facts about this leader and the castle that have been established with relative certainty. Hyracanus was the head of the Tobiad family, whose existence—as well as a description of this castle and the surrounding caves—is recounted in the writing of the 1st-century historian Flavius Josephus’s book Antiquities of the Jews. The book describes a large white castle into which “animals of a prodigious magnitude” were carved. It also notes that at one point, the castle was surrounded by canals of water. While traces of the ancient moat are no longer visible to the amateur eye, any visitor to Qasr al-‘Abed can see that the structure is indeed decorated with carvings of lions. Though worn smooth by years of rain and wind, they still stand out prominently from the rest of the castle wall. Although the fortress was quite severely damaged in the earthquake of 362, it was restored by the 1990s. Surrounded by verdant hills and wildflowers, it’s a popular day trip for locals, who, in late spring and during the summer, often have barbecues nearby.  Entrance to the caves is free. In theory, you need just a few dinars to enter the castle, but this entrance fee isn't always enforced. Just above the caves is a lush hill filled with Jordanian wildflowers.

While most visitors venture to see the Temple of Hercules or the remains of the Hercules statue, just above the temple is the marvelous Umayyad Palace. The Umayyad Palace gives visitors a glimpse into life during the Umayyad period in what is now Jordan. While largely restored, the palace is a popular photo spot, as both inside and out offer spectacular images. The site itself is significant because its occupation dates back to the Neolithic age, although its importance declined after the Umayyad period. Today, the palace sees a steady stream of visitors who come for its archaeological significance and the panoramic views of Amman.  Umayyad Palace is at the top of a hill, Jabal al-Qal'a. If driving, there is a free parking lot on site. The entrance to the site is JD3 or will be included in the Jordan Pass.

The ancient town of Es-Salt is home to remarkable Ottoman architecture, the legendary location of the prophet Job’s interment, and streets so narrow and winding that for some residents trash collection is done via donkey instead of vehicle. Full of gorgeous panoramas and historic structures, Es-Salt is best appreciated by way of a strenuous trek up the historic Harmony Trail. At the end of the ascent stands a striped pink-and-white stone building locally known as al-Qal’a, Arabic for “The Castle.” In fact, it is a mosque and memorial to Ottoman soldiers who died in the vicinity during World War I. Though it requires a long hike, the view of Es-Salt from The Castle is worth the effort. On this peak, you’ll be standing atop layers and layers of history. While it was founded by Alexander the Great, there is attestation in both written and archaeological record (some of which is on display at the city’s museum) that the area was previously settled by a Semitic-speaking people. It has seen Byzantines, Ghassanid Arabs, Mongols, Mamluks, Ottomans, Brits, and others pass through—alternatively building, ravaging, repairing, and occupying the city. However, the mark left on the city by the Ottomans has persisted. Under these Turkish-speaking rulers, Es-Salt was the administrative capital of Jordan, and it is consequently full of stunning examples of Ottoman architecture, characterized by long arching windows and elegantly carved stone. Its style has also been influenced by Nablusi architects, who came from Palestine in the late 19th century. This city boasts the oldest public secondary school in Jordan (visible in the distance from The Castle), which is still in operation. In the days when trade was carried out on foot or by caravan, Es-Salt was an important hub, lying on the path between Amman and Jerusalem. Es-Salt has historically been a mixed city of Muslims and Christians, as attested to by the presence of numerous mosques and churches distributed among the tightly packed line of houses bordering the winding streets. Of all the churches, Al-Khader, or St. George Orthodox Church, is the most famous. It incorporates a small cave and is covered in ornate paintings of the disciples and of St. George slaying a dragon. Another highlight is the Al-Hammam Road, which runs through a bustling marketplace frequented by locals and whose doors are reminiscent of some of the famous markets in Syria. You’d be hard-pressed to find a better place to visit for an authentic Jordanian experience.  Parking can be a hassle, especially on the steep hills. Cars can park on the lower levels of the city, but past a certain height, if you even see a car, it belongs to a resident. Bring lots of water and wear modest clothing to enter the church and the mosque. A small archaeological museum can be accessed from the center of the city; entrance fees are only a few dinars.

141,Damiya Dolmen Field,Jordan,This ancient stone necropolis is in danger of disappearing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/damiya-dolmen-field,"The megalithic tombs are known as “dolmen” can be found in countries across the world, and in each case, the delicate standing stones are in danger of being toppled. This has never more true than in the case of the Damiya Dolmen Field in the Jordan Valley, if only thanks to the sheer number of structures. Consisting of around 300 dolmen dating back to between 3600 and 3000 BCE, the arid fields are being encroached on all sides by the march of progress. The average dolmen at the site stands around one meter tall and between three and seven meters long, depending on the size of the massive rocks they are made of.  The cut-stone burial sites are under attack from various quarrying operations whose destructive practices threaten to wipe the historic graves from the face of the Earth. Given the age and rudimentary construction of the squat tombs, they are quite fragile and collapse easily. The constant threats to the Damiya Dolmen Field have attracted the attention of preservation organizations as the World Monuments Fund who placed the site on their 2010 watch list, resulting in a planned archeological park at the site. Unfortunately, the protective undertaking would require a great deal of funds and support, and to this end, the fields were placed once again on the Fund’s 2014 watch list. After centuries of protecting the dead, this site may not be able to protect itself.",rocks cemeteries geology ruins
142,Um er-Rasas,"Umm ar-Rasas, Jordan",The remains of three different ancient civilizations have been found at this rich archaeological site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/um-errasas,"Nowadays, not many people are familiar with this unique archaeological site, but the ancient Jordanian town of Um er-Rasas must have been quite important in antiquity. It is mentioned in the Bible (Jeremiah 48:21) under its earlier name, Kastron Mefaa, as well as in the writings of the Christian historian Eusebius around 500 CE. Artifacts unearthed from the ruins of Um er-Rasas (also spelled Umm ar-Rasas) suggest this site was inhabited since at least the Iron Age, around 800 BCE. The ancient Romans established a military camp here, then the site became a religious center for early Christians in Byzantine times, and eventually an Islamic center during the early period of Islam. Amazingly, remains from all three civilizations have been found, making Um er-Rasas a microcosm of Middle Eastern history. At first sight, Um er-Rasas may come across as rather underwhelming, as it looks like a vast expanse of rubble. However, once you start meandering through it, you start realizing how rich this archaeological site is, with layers upon layers of ancient history narrated through the language of architecture. A guide can greatly enhance a visit, but even an untrained eye can appreciate the endurance of millennia-old archways, pillars, and walls. Among the highlights are a fortified military camp, 16 churches, a square tower, and mosaic floors. The mosaic of St Stephen’s Church is of particular artistic and historical significance, as it dates back to the Byzantine Empire and depicts locations in Palestine and Egypt. Archaeologists have discovered that this priceless mosaic is actually sitting on another, older mosaic. The narrow square tower is also interesting, as it is, in fact, a Stylite tower. Stylite hermits were Christian ascetics that used to ascend to the top of this kind of towers to fast, pray, and meditate for years on end.  Um er-Rasas is about 50 miles (76 km) south of Amman. The site is about 7 miles (14 km) off King's Highway.",islam mosaics christianity roman ancient religion archaeology sacred spaces
143,Hejaz Railway Train of Wadi Rum,"Shakaria, Jordan",A refurbished locomotive from a bygone era in the middle of the Jordanian desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hejaz-railway-train-wadi-rum,"Textured with soft sand dunes and cascading rocks, painted with a palette of endless red, the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan is a piece of Mars on Earth. For this reason, the arid landscape has been used to portray the Red Planet in such Hollywood films as “The Martian.” It also appeared in “Lawrence of Arabia.” The latter showcases the vast expanses of the desert in its dramatization of the Great Arab Revolt. It is this historical aspect of Wadi Rum that you will see on display at Jordan’s Hejaz Railway desert stop. The refurbished locomotive sitting at this desert station invokes the memory of the century-old conflict that helped shape the modern Middle East. In 1916, the world was at war, and much of the Arabic-speaking world was controlled by the Ottoman Turkish Empire. The Allied leadership—Britain, France and Russia—sought to force the Turks out of the region; they urged Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, to join the Allies and take up arms against the Ottomans in return for Arab independence. Hussein agreed, and over the course of the next two years, the Arabs assisted in a major war effort to defeat the Turks. Under the leadership of Hussein’s son, Prince Faisal—and with assistance from the illustrious T.E. Lawrence “of Arabia”—the Arabs fought a guerilla-style war by interrupting train passages on the Hejaz Railway. In the first three weeks of May, 1918 alone, the Arabs destroyed railway tracks on 25 separate occasions. These attacks on transportation systems wreaked havoc on Turkish lines of communication and were instrumental in defeating the Turks and ending the Great War. In the years that followed, the new nations of Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria were formed north of the Arabian Peninsula. The origins of the modern Middle East thus trace their way back to the attacks on the trains of the Hejaz Railway. The refurbished steamer at the Hejaz Wadi Rum stop puts that history on display for today’s audiences. Visitors can walk the perimeter of the train and take pictures, or step inside to observe the compartments. On certain occasions, visitors can even pay to the board the train and partake in a mock battle during a show put on by the Jordan Heritage Revival Company. Wadi Rum may be on your bucket list for its visual parallels to the arid, crimson landscapes of Mars, but a stop at the desert’s Hejaz Railway station is worth the time. Because finding unique, historical gems within famous destinations is often one of the most rewarding parts of travel.",martian landscapes film locations deserts railroads trains war history ecosystems military
144,Dana Village,"Bsaira District, Jordan",A ghost village sits atop a mountain within Jordan’s largest biosphere reserve.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dana-village,"Perched on the edge of a cliff above Wadi Dana in Jordan’s Tafileh Governate, a collection of picturesque stone houses and dirt roads interspersed with overgrown cacti stands as a living memory of what Arab villages looked like in the late 1800s. Located within the Dana Biosphere Reserve, the once-abandoned village has had a second life breathed into it in recent years by a growing ecotourism sector. Though the majority of the Dana Village’s original inhabitants and their descendants now live a 10-minute drive away in Al-Qadisiyyah, their former homes have been reanimated with the lights of small ecolodges and restaurants catering to adventurous tourists hoping to spend long hours hiking in the valley below. Known as Wadi Dana, this giant canyon is actually part of the Jordan River Valley, which, in turn, constitutes a section of the Great Rift Valley. It’s not hard to see why scores of nature lovers flock to this remote location. The biosphere is characterized by a number of seeming paradoxes that make for a fascinating experience. Tafileh, which is further south than all but two other governates, regularly receives more snow than most of the country, thanks to its high elevation. That’s not all that distinguishes the area, though. The Dana Biosphere Reserve includes no fewer than four bio-geographical zones—Mediterranean, Irano-Turanian, Saharo-Arabian, and Sudanian—making it a haven for at least 894 plants, 190 bird, 37 mammal, and 36 reptile species. Hikers are afforded the chance to observe life that can be difficult to spot elsewhere, such as the Spiny Tailed Lizard or the elusive Sand Cat, which is the only feline that spends the vast majority of its time in the desert. This abundance of animals, plants, and water—which flows in the form of perennial streams fed by numerous springs, rain, and melted snow—has made Dana ideal for human habitation. Paleolithic people first called it home, but throughout history, it has been ruled by numerous great civilizations: Egyptian, Nabatean, Roman, Byzantine/Ghassanid, and Ottoman. During the Ottoman period, the Al Ata’ata tribe settled in the area and built what is now Dana Village. Another attractive feature of Dana is its proximity to Wadi Faynan, which was second only to Cyprus in terms of copper production in the southern Mediterranean. Evidence of copper mining in Wadi Faynan dates all the way back some 5,000-plus years to the Chalcolithic period. Continuing all the way through the 4th century AD (with a final short burst of activity in the Mamluk Period), this copper production left behind over 200,000 pounds of slag. Additionally, the valley was a source of coveted minerals, further adding to its regional importance. Manganese and phosphate mining is still a source of wealth, but with the spike in tourism, locals have begun exploring other livelihoods. Notably, Bedouin women have started craft-making collectives, and the profits gained from their handiwork are one way in which they participate in the local economy.  Tours of the village are offered, and tourism infrastructure such as eco-lodges and restaurants have sprung up through the village, which is also home to the offices of the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature.",biodiversity nature preserves landscapes hiking deserts trails ghost towns birds abandoned nature animals
145,Fortress of Machaerus,"Areedh Sub-District, Jordan",These ruins by the Dead Sea is where John the Baptist met his untimely end.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortress-of-machaerus,"Going for antiquity in Jordan means going Biblical.  The Fortress of Machaerus is located on the northeastern shore of the Dead Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan River.  There is evidence that this is where John the Baptist was kept captive and eventually beheaded in 32 AD on Salome’s request. Alexander Jannaeus (104-78 BC) had the Fortress of Machaerus built on top of a hill in 90 BC for geopolitical reasons. If today, the fortress offers breathtaking views of the Dead Sea and the surrounding area, at its inception, it offered a great vantage point to observe military movements on and around the Dead Sea. Among the string of historical figures that presided over the Fortress of Machaerus is Herod the Great, Herod Antipas, and Herod Agrippa I, after whose death (44 AD), the fortress was conquered by the Romans. Jewish insurgents took over in 66 AD but Romans took the fortress back in 72 AD. It was around this time that Romans tore down the fortress leaving nothing but the foundations. Archaeological studies began in 1968 and underwent different phases through the years. Sections of the royal palace survived, including fragments of mosaics. Excavations unearthed pottery whose style and age coincides with the different peoples that occupied the fortress. Now, in addition to the original foundations of the fortress are also five full columns (Doric and Ionic) and some partial ones. These are damaged columns found lying on site that an archaeological team reassembled, reinforced, and re-erected in the spot where they used to stand. This restoration work was carried out using a technique called anastylosis, which means that the original materials, techniques, and styles were used as much as possible in the restoration process.  The hilltop fortress of Machaerus is located on the eastern side of the Dead Sea and is about 53 kilometers southwest of the city of Amman.",jordan ruins

Kerak’s strategic location made it the target of many sieges, some more successful than others. The castle stood to see both Christian and Muslim rule, including a stint under the control of the legendary Saladin. In popular culture, Kerak Castle is notable for its part in the 2005 Ridley Scott film, Kingdom of Heaven. The structure is an early example of a fortified Frankish Crusader Castle, using elements of European, Byzantine, and Arab designs. Over the centuries, the castle grew with representative additions from its Christian, Muslim, Mamluk, and Ottoman lords. Today, the Crusader architecture exists mostly on the upper level of the castle and is identified by its dark, rough volcanic rock, while the later Arab additions are made from white limestone. The town of Kerak, located on the ancient King’s Highway between Amman and Aqaba, was once known as the Kingdom of Moab, as mentioned in the Bible. Over two millennia old, Kerak was home to the Nabateans, Romans, and the Byzantines before the Crusaders took it over.  Al-Karak lies 87 miles south of Amman on the King's Highway.

147,Gerald Lankester Harding's Burial Place,"Jarash, Jordan",The 20th-century archaeologist was interred among the ruins of an ancient Roman city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gerald-lankester-hardings-burial-place,"Within one of the world’s most spectacular ancient sites lies a small, humble tomb. Unlike most tombs in such sites, it does not contain a long-dead monarch, emperor, or any other character from the distant past. Instead, it houses a 20th-century man whose passion for ancient history and its protection earned him a spot overlooking the site of his former work. Gerald Lankester Harding, or G.L. Harding, was born on December 8, 1901, in Tientsin, China. After a brief time in Singapore, he ventured to the United Kingdom in 1913 and eventually fell into the world of archaeology, joining his first expedition to Palestine in 1926. Harding’s influence on Jordan should not be underestimated. He was responsible for founding the Archaeological Museum in Amman and the still-running journal The Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan. He also published The Antiquities of Jordan, an overview of the many archaeological sites of Jordan that remained the most popular guidebook to Jordan for decades. Harding died on February 11, 1979, in London, and had previously requested to be interred at the Jerash Archaeological Site, where he worked. The Kingdom of Jordan honored his request, and his ashes were sent to be buried overlooking the site he spent so much time protecting. His remains were interred at a spot called the Mortuary Church, which dates back to between 600 and 749 and is surrounded by a number of small tombs. Harding’s memorial is a simple, peaceful place in an incredible ancient Roman site that he is partially responsible for excavating and maintaining. After a life devoted to the ancient world, Harding himself has become part of the storied history of its ruins, and will forever rest among them.  Visitors should be aware that it can be challenging to reach. There are no direct paths there, and given its isolated location within the Jerash site, it has very few visitors. Expect to fight your way through tangled sticks and long grass to get there. It is in between the Temple of Zeus and the Temple of Artemis. The easiest way to find it might be to walk along the border of the site from one temple to the other. The mortuary church is below ground level, so visitors will not see it until you are within a few meters. From either the Temple of Artemis, Temple of Zeus, or the main walking area, the site can be visited in 5 to 15 minutes depending on fitness, terrain, and clothing. The Jerash Archaeological Site is included in the Jordan Pass.",roman burial places ancient memorials archaeology ruins
148,Sports City,"Amman, Jordan","This sprawling, formerly elite sporting complex in Amman, Jordan has become a local picnic spot.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sports-city,"Named after Jordan’s third monarch, King Hussein Sports City sits crumbling in the center of Amman. Drained swimming pools, empty gymnasiums, and miles of overgrown track lie nestled between two major thoroughfares in the central neighborhood of Shmeisani. Peeling walls painted with slogans entreating readers to behave in a sporting manner surround the formerly pristine, top-of-the-line complex. Instead of harboring the physical activity its name implies, this decrepit monument to fitness now provides a venue for friends and family to gather outdoors in dusty patches of shade. Officially or otherwise, Sport City has come to provide much needed respite from the incessant sight and sound of Amman’s traffic, thanks to its anomalous swath of publicly-accessible land in Amman, where parks and public spaces are a rarity. The most popular pastimes include enjoying picnics or smoking hookah – a far cry from the vigorous pursuits the nation’s top athletes once undertook here. In fact, visitors to today’s Sport City expressly seek out its arenas with the intention to avoid working up a sweat. They simply want a place to chill away from life’s daily races. After strolling through the complex, one is left awestruck at the amount of capital the government once poured into the infrastructure project. Yet it serves a more important role to the citizens of Amman in its semi-abandoned state than it ever did as a sporting complex.  Most of Amman's cab drivers will easily be able to easily navigate to the entrance of the complex after being prompted with the phrase ""Sports City""",sports parks abandoned

But even the brightly decorated outside pales in comparison to the stunning inside of the building, in which nearly every space is bedecked in mirrors. Floors, walls, pieces of furniture, and even the bathroom sink are decorated with mirrors in all possible shapes and colors. The creator of the building is Italian-born Lidia al-Qattan, a painter, sculptor and jeweller who is married to Kuwaiti artist Khalifa al-Qattan. The work started with what later became an obsession, when her husband travelled to an exhibition abroad. She felt lonely during his absence, and began to decorate a cabinet with mirrorpieces. When he returned, he was impressed with the result, and encouraged her to continue, and she did. Even though this is a lived-in building, the owners are eager to show curious visitors their home.

150,Failaka Island,"Zoor, Kuwait",Wander among the ghostly ruins of an island where civilization flourished for thousands of years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/failaka-island,"Failaka Island lies about 20 km off the Kuwaiti mainland.  Archaeological excavations unearthed tools dating from 3000 BC, and ruins show that Mesopotamian civilization existed on Failaka island in 2000 BC.  Other artefacts show that the island has been continuously inhabited since then.  This record was almost broken in 1990. Prior to 1990, two thousand people inhabited the island, most living in or around Zoor (also spelt Zawr), the only town on the island.  During the weeks leading up to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, most people fled to the mainland, and the few that remained behind were forcefully deported by Iraqi troops.  Over the last few months of 1990 and the beginning of 1991, Iraqi forces used Failaka Island for target practice.  Beaches were mined and infrastructures damaged.  In February 1991, a US-led coalition forced Iraqi troops stationed on Failaka Island to surrender. In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, some of the original inhabitants returned to live on the island, some others turned their property into a weekend retreat, but most did not return.  The beaches were demined and the infrastructure was partly restored.  Today, most buildings on Failaka Island lie abandoned, riddled with bullet holes, covered by a layer of sand and overgrown with the sturdiest indigenous vegetation.  The ground is littered with cartridges, bomb casings, and other miscellaneous military items that have stood the test of time.  North of Zoor, Iraqi tanks and military vehicles, semi-destroyed and abandoned, make for an eerie sight. Another notable location on Failaka Island is the National Bank of Kuwait building, which must have been a particular favourite for target practice considering the amount of damaged inflicted on it.  There is no public transport on Failaka Island. Ikarus is a ferry boat company running tours of the island, but they are a bit rushed. An alternative is to rent a car in Kuwait City, put it on a KPTC ferry, and stay on the island overnight. Accommodation options are limited, but they do exist in Zoor. Parts of the island are off limits as the Kuwaity Army uses them for military maneuvers.",ghost towns war history islands archaeology abandoned military
151,Kuwait Water Towers,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",Kuwait City's uniquely designed water towers look straight out of a retro sci-fi cityscape.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuwait-water-towers,"Dotted around Kuwait City are six groupings of eye-catching water towers. Five are composed of striped mushroom-shaped towers, and a sixth features towers that look like they’re about to take off for Alpha Centauri, albeit in a retro sci-fi kind of way. In 1953, the city set up two large seawater distillation plants. A lack of a piped water distribution system, however, meant that this water had to be transported to customers in tankers. So in 1965, a Swedish engineering firm was commissioned to build a modern water distribution system to connect the distillation plants to Kuwait City with an expansive system of water towers erected around the city. But the Amir of Kuwait at the time, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed, didn’t want just any old water towers. He wanted structures that would also function as works of art—landmarks that would impart a sense of modernity and technological advancement upon all who gazed upon them. The firm presented a number of tower designs, and two types were selected. Five of the groups, consisting of 31 towers in total, feature the so-called Mushroom Towers, completed in 1976. These vertically stripped towers do indeed resemble mushrooms, supported on shafts of varying heights. Each concrete tank has a capacity of 3,000 cubic meters, with the groups placed in strategic locations around the city. Part of the reasoning behind the mushroom design was to create a kind of pillared hall, where shade was cast on the desert floor beneath the giant mushrooms. The idea was to create landscape gardens in the grounds beneath them, but not all of the groups have yet been decked out as such. For the sixth and final tower group, the Amir wanted something even more impressive, as these were to stand prominently on the bay across from the Amir’s palace compound. The engineering firm presented a handful of designs, and the Amir chose one that wouldn’t look at all out of place in a retro sci-fi cityscape. This group of three towers, known simply as the Kuwait Towers, was completed in 1979. The largest is a 607-foot concrete “needle” supporting two spheres along its length. The spheres themselves are clad in enameled steel plates, arranged in spiral patterns and in eight shades of blue, green and gray—a design chosen to imitate the mosaic surfaces of Islamic domes. The lowest but largest sphere is divided in two; its upper half contains a restaurant, banquet hall, and indoor garden, while the lower half holds a large reservoir. The second and highest sphere holds no water, instead functioning as a rotating viewing platform and café. The second tower is 482 feet tall and serves only as a water tower. The third is a bare needle with no spheres, but does hold equipment and lighting that illuminates the other two towers.  The five groups of Mushroom Towers can be seen sprinkled around Kuwait City, and are typically admired from afar as nothing more than landmarks. The map coordinates above point to the Kuwait Towers, located in downtown Kuwait City, on the bay and just off Arabian Gulf Street in the Sharq District. The Viewing Sphere opens from 9 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. daily. The entrance fee is 3 Kuwaiti dinar (about $10 USD). The restaurant is free to enter and is open from 8 a.m. until midnight.",water towers spheres science fiction engineering towers infrastructure design art
152,Tareq Rajab Museum of Islamic Calligraphy,"Jabriya, Kuwait","A private collection of over 30,000 ancient and modern items showcasing the beauty of Islamic calligraphy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tareq-rajab-museum-of-islamic-calligraphy,"This remarkable museum houses the private collection of Tareq Sayed Rajad, a Kuwaiti national with a passion for art, history, archaeology and, of course, calligraphy. Rajad’s collection was first opened as a museum in 1980, but suffered a setback in August 1990 when Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. Fearing destruction, the museum staff packed up each item in the collection and hid the boxes in a secluded place that was eventually blocked off. Not all the items in the museum could be rescued, but in spite of this, the museum reopened again in 1991. A little over a decade later, Rajad decided to open a museum entirely dedicated to Islamic calligraphy. The Tareq Rajab Museum of Islamic Calligraphy consists of two sections, one dedicated to manuscripts, miniatures, pottery, metalwork, and carvings, and the other to clothing, jewelry, musical instruments, and other items. Given the size of the collection, it is difficult to single out individual items. But among the most prized artifacts on display are an extremely rare folio with Hijazi script from the 7th century and manuscripts by Yaqut al-Musta’simi, a famous 12th-century calligrapher. The museum doesn’t only focus on pieces with historical value, however. Islamic calligraphy is about creating a harmonious work of art that expresses feelings, traditions, and aesthetics. These themes can be seen displayed throughout the collection, on different media, influenced by different cultures, and ultimately imbued with the aesthetic sensibility and mastery of the artist.  The museum is located on Street 1 in Jabriya, about 5.5 miles (9 km) southeast of Kuwait City.",writing ancient museums and collections art museums
153,'Highway of Death',"Abdali, Kuwait",This road earned its macabre nickname after hundreds of Iraqi troops died along it in 1991.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/highway-of-death,"Highway 80 was used by Iraqi troops to invade Kuwait. It became known as the “Highway of Death” when Iraqi troops later used it to retreat. A six-lane highway linking Basra to Kuwait City, Highway 80 proved to be extremely useful to invading Iraqi forces in early August 1990.  In a short time, approximately 300,000 Iraqi troops poured into Kuwait, mostly using this roadway. On August 8, 1990, Iraq officially annexed Kuwait, and on the same day, the first United States Air Force planes began to amass in Saudi Arabia, while NATO and other Arab countries joined military efforts to contain the conflict. On January 17, 1991, a U.S.-led coalition started hitting strategic Iraqi targets. It wasn’t until February 24 that coalition ground forces were deployed, and three days later, Iraqi troops started retreating from Kuwait. It was over these few days that coalition forces bombed the head and tail of the military convoy, trapping the Iraqi troops on Highway 80. For 10 hours, one airstrike followed another, destroying hundreds of vehicles. The death toll on Highway 80 is a matter of contention, from an unlikely low estimate of 200 casualties to a more credible estimate of 500 or 600 casualties. Highway 80 was repaired soon after the invasion was over. And, in a strange twist of fate, the road was used by U.S. and British forces in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Pictures of hundreds of torched vehicles along a strip of asphalt in the desert became iconic images of the Persian Gulf War. As a result of this, Highway 80 has appeared in poems, movies, and video games. These days, it’s a busy road cutting through desert and farming land. The only reminders of what happened on this road are a handful of road signs thanking U.S. troops.  Highway 80 runs from Kuwait City (Kuwait) to Basra (Iraq). As it's still an active road, take caution if you decide to stop and take pictures.",roads death military history war history military
154,Al-Qurain Martyrs Museum,"Qurain, Kuwait",The site of a bloody showdown between invading Iraqi forces and a cell of the popular resistance in Kuwait.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-qurain-martyrs-museum,"In the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion in 1990, several cells of popular resistance arose throughout Kuwait. One of these groups was formed by 31 young men who took a collective oath to defend their native land. They called themselves the Al-Messilah Group. First, the group collected all the weapons they could get their hands on, including buying them from Iraqi soldiers who were desperate for cash to buy food and water. Second, Al-Messilah began carrying out urban guerrilla activities. Between the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991, they bombed Iraqi military targets and sniped Iraqi soldiers. When security became tighter, the group decided to relocate to Al-Qurain, about 12 miles south of Kuwait City, due to the small presence of Iraqi troops in the area. Al-Messilah Group went underground for some time, but when the U.S.-led coalition announced its plans to liberate Kuwait, Iraqi operations became more and more ruthless, and the resistance decided to restart its activities. On February 24, 1991, Al-Messilah, housed in a private house in Al-Qurain, was readying itself to support the liberation troops. At 8 a.m., 19 members of the group were in the building when an Iraqi contingent approached. A soldier knocked at the door, and, receiving no answer, jumped over the fence and attempted to break into the house. It was standard procedure that if people were found, they would be imprisoned, and if people were not found, the building would be ransacked. Al-Messilah Group could either surrender or fight, and they chose the latter. A member of Al-Messilah Group shot the soldier dead. Another Iraqi official was shot at and injured. The contingent retreated in a hurry, but in a short time, Iraqi forces surrounded the mansion, and a bloody battle ensued. The battle lasted 10 hours, during which Al-Messilah Group is said to have killed hundreds of troops. At about 6 a.m. Iraqi troops managed to overpower the Kuwait fighters and entered the building, but their reconnaissance was made difficult by the darkness and the amount of rubble piled up everywhere. Buried under the rubble, undetected, were seven members of Al-Messilah Group, injured but alive. Of the 19 members who were trapped in the house, only they survived. In the aftermath of the liberation, the Kuwaiti government turned this semi-destroyed house into a national museum, the Al-Qurain Martyrs Museum. The rubble was cleared, but holes pockmark all the walls of the building, both in and outside. Sections of the floors and walls have collapsed, and destruction can be seen everywhere. Across from the museum is one of the Iraqi tanks used in the battle. Two exhibition rooms were opened on the ground floor. On display are the weapons used by Al-Messilah Group and the ammunition used by Iraqi forces, alongside documents related to the battle. One of these documents is an official order found in an Iraqi vehicle instructing troops to “burn and destroy all homes on which there were slogans hostile to our leadership.”  Al-Qurain Martyrs Museum is located in the densely populated town of Al-Qurain, about 12 miles (20 km) south of Kuwait City. Public transport can take you to Al-Qurain from Kuwait City, but you are likely to be dropped on King Fahed Bin Abdul Aziz Road. The museum is about half a mile (1 km) from there.",war memorial war history memorials military museums history
155,Beiteddine Palace,"Beiteddine, Lebanon",After this one-of-a-kind palace was built the architect's hands are said to have been cut off to keep it that way.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beit-ed-dine-palace,"When first laying eyes on Beit ed-Dine Palace it’s easy to see why it is seen as one of Lebanon’s greatest cultural treasures with its elaborate architecture, historic mosaics, and priceless decorations. However, all of this beauty was created at a high human cost. Built over 30 years beginning in 1788, the palace was the personal home of emir Bashir Shihab II who wanted the mansion to be a place of singular beauty and legendary opulence. The castle was built on a hermitage called Beiteddine (House of Faith) and featured all manner of amenity including a lush personal apartment for the emir, a harem, and a rich guest house that was often offered to passing luminaries and dignitaries. Many of the surfaces were inlaid with intricate mosaics and designs, many of which have survived remarkably well to this day. Unfortunately all of this grandeur is said to have come at a great price. While it is likely an apocryphal story, it’s been said that the emir ordered that the architect of his palace have his hands cut right off so that the Beit ed-Dine Palace could not be duplicated. In addition he is said to have conscripted all of his healthy male subjects to work on the project for days at a time for no pay. Despite the possible labor tragedies associated with it, the palace was eventually taken over by the Ottomans and used as a government building before eventually being turned into a protected historic site. Today the palace still retains its stunning architecture and hand-made mosaics and is an important site for both visitors and the people of Lebanon.",mosaics palaces architectural oddities architecture
156,The Grudge (Al Ba’sa),"Beirut, Lebanon",Beirut's thinnest building was the result of feuding brothers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-grudge-al-basa-beirut-lebanon,"A sliver-thin house in Beirut, built in 1954, is the ultimate display of how deep sibling annoyance can go. Known as The Grudge, or Al Ba’sa in Arabic, the house is just a bit over 13 feet at its widest point, and just around 2 feet at its narrowest. At a side view, the “house” built of brotherly spite looks more like a wall than a place to live. But despite its narrow dimensions, Al Ba’sa is habitable, and is the skinniest building in the city. As the story goes, two brothers inherited land from their father. They couldn’t decide how to split the land between them, a dispute complicated further by the fact that one part of the property had been cut over the years by various municipal infrastructure projects, leaving a portion of the land a small and sort of odd shape. One brother decided to take that small, oddly shaped bit of land and build on it, constructing a building that fit the confines of the land with the added bonus of blocking his brother’s ocean view. Not only would his brother not be able to enjoy his spectacular sea view, but because he was now facing what was essentially a wall his property values would sink, too. The perfect plan. Over the years, there have been some tenants in the house that sibling rivalry built. Each floor of the structure contains two apartments. For years, one was in use as a brothel, while the others served as refuge for a family fleeing the war. Today the house stands as a reminder of a long-ago feud, and it probably will for a very long time; current city zoning laws state that the plot of land the house sits on is too small to build on. If The Grudge comes down, nothing else can be put in its place, making the land more profitable with the house than without it. As architect Sandra Rishani pointed out in her essay on the house, Al Ba’sa “continues to exist grudgingly and also defiantly in one of Beirut’s most prime locations, only time will tell what will become of it.” The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

157,Baalbek Trilithon,"Baalbek, Lebanon",The largest hewn stone in history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baalbek-trilithon,"There were many stone movers in the ancient world. From Stonehenge to Macchu Picchu, ancient peoples found a way to move stones of massive proportions. The Olmec of Central America moved enormous stone heads, possibly by floating them down rivers on rafts. The Inca created mountaintop kingdoms out of enormous yet intricately fitted stones, each dragged for dozens of miles. Easter Islanders carved and moved some of the largest stone sculptures ever created. The largest hewn stone yet discovered, however, was not found in any of these places, but in the Lebanese town of Baalbeck, in the ruins of a city once known as Heliopolis, “the City of the Sun.” In the base of the ruins of the Jupiter Baal Temple lie three hewn stones known together as the “trilithon.” Each is estimated to weigh over 750 tons. Construction on the massive Roman temple of Jupiter began roughly 27 years before the birth of Jesus, and while most scholars agree the blocks were cut by the Romans, there is some evidence that the trilithon may predate their presence in the Middle East. In fact, the stones may predate even Alexander the Great, who founded Heliopolis in 334 B.C. Whether Roman masons or some other group, someone devised a way to move these massive blocks from the quarry over many miles and to then lift them onto a base of smaller blocks. In addition to the trilithon, there is a fourth stone in the temple, the largest of them all—indeed, the largest stone ever hewn by man. Known as the “Stone of the Pregnant Woman,” it weighs an estimated 1,200 tons—equivalent to three Boeing 747s. This massive weight apparently proved too much for anyone to move, and the stone was left in the place where it was cut, an enormous rectangle sticking up at an angle from the ground. How Roman architects (or whoever it was that moved the trilithon) ever thought they would move such an enormous block remains a source of much debate.

158,Jeita Grotto,"Jitta, Lebanon",A monumental underground karstic wonderland is also the water source for over a million citizens of Beirut.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jeita-grotto,"In 1836, American missionary Reverend William Thomson was poking around in a cave in Lebanon when he happened upon an underground river. Intrigued by the find and suspecting the cave held more to be discovered, Thomson—in remarkably American fashion—pulled out his gun and squeezed off a shot to aurally investigate further. The resulting echo made him believe he’d happened upon something rather impressive. He wasn’t wrong. Jeita Grotto (Arabic: مغارة جعيتا‎‎) is a spectacular underground system consisting of two separate cave systems intertwined with one other, with a total astounding length of 5.6 miles (9 kilometers), making it the longest cave system in the Middle East. The Lower Cave is home to an underground river some 3.9 miles (6.2 kilometers) long, while the Upper Cave features innumerable dazzling rock formations including one of the largest hanging stalactites in the world, measuring 27 feet (8.2 meters). It is more accurate to say that Thomson rediscovered Jeita Grotto, as various chambers were inhabited during prehistoric times, and the remains of an ancient foundry in an exterior portion of the Lower Cave suggest that it was used for swordsmithing in antiquity. Today the subterranean river that flows through it forms the headwaters of Nahr al-Kalb, a river that provides fresh water to over one million people in Beirut. The Lower Cave was opened to the public in 1958, at which time the previously unknown Upper Cave was also discovered. Visitor access to the Upper Cave commenced in 1969 with an inauguration ceremony featuring an electronic music concert by François Bayle. The Lebanese Civil War led to the closure of Jeita Grotto in 1978, as the tunnels were being used to store ammunition. Treasured as one of the national symbols of Lebanon, the site was reopened to the public in 1995. Today, visitors can tour three chambers in the Upper Cave via platforms and raised walkways that permit exploration without disturbing the natural landscape. The Lower Cave can only be toured by boat. The annual swelling of the river leaves the Lower Cave unnavigable and thus closed to visitors in the winter. Grab a coat or something to keep warm!

Wandering around the various ruins offers visitors a fascinating walk through history. People have lived in Byblos since the Neolithic era, and the city witnessed the rise of the Phoenician civilization. This archaeological site exists as a preserved timeline of the many people who once called this patch of land home. Ruins from different eras speckle the space. Some of the older structures, like the L-shaped temple, date from as far back as 2700 BC. Newer structures were built on top of older ones as various civilizations settled the space, each one leaving behind fragments of their own histories. Bits of Roman pillars litter the tomb of a 4,000-year dead king of Byblos. Roman structures and a later Crusader castle are built with mysterious pink granite quarried in Egypt. There’s also a Persian fort, the Temple of Obelisks (which was built on top of the L-shaped temple), Phoenician dwellings and tombs, and a charming Roman theater with the Mediterranean sea as its backdrop. A large proportion of the ancient artifacts you can see at Beirut’s National Museum were excavated here.  Easy to locate from Jbeil, entrance is around $10.

160,The Egg,"Beirut, Lebanon",This modernist cinema has survived war and reconstruction to become a symbol of Lebanon’s revolutionary spirit.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-egg-beirut,"This modernist movie theater was once the jewel of a bustling downtown in pre-war Beirut, but today it is full of bullet holes. The district is a short walk from the rocky Mediterranean coast, and was once dotted with cinemas. The Egg, which was officially part of the never-finished Beirut City Center complex, was one of the most unusual. It was popular among Beirut residents until civil war broke out in the 1970s, and the building suddenly found itself on the front line separating the West and East. The structure was built in 1965 by Lebanese architect Joseph Philippe Karam, part of a golden age of construction when modernist designers were commissioned to experiment with new ideas and materials across the city. Karam envisioned two large towers on either side of the cinema. Only one was built, and it didn’t survive the war. What did survive years of fighting was the distinct, egg-shaped shell of the cinema—with the scars to prove it. The Egg remained off-limits to the public as downtown Beirut was razed and reconstructed after the war. For years, it remained a curiosity to a generation of Lebanese with no connection to the old downtown area. Only after massive protests swept the country, beginning in October 2019, were the barriers torn down. Protestors flooded the building, decorating it with art and holding raves and film screenings inside. Now, any passerby is welcome to explore the building and witness an iconic piece of Beirut’s history.  The structure is impossible to miss from Martyrs’ Square in downtown Beirut. Simply walk over the remnants of a barricade to go inside the building. Take care, as the site hasn’t been inspected for safety in decades.",modernism war theaters civil war film military

The ruins of the stone structure, one of four altars in the surrounding area, were once part of either a tower, a tomb, or a temple. The partially collapsed stone edifice stands on the western side of the Mount Lebanon, on a summit called Faqra. The 52-by-52-foot cube is just over 32 feet tall. But considering its wide base, and the number of stones, it was likely much taller when it was built in 43 AD. A staircase and pieces of pillars and pedestals certainly confirm the place once had a second story, now long gone. What’s left of two inscriptions above and to the right of the door dedicate the altar to the Roman Emperor Claudius and the god Beelgalasos. Translated from Greek, they read: “In 355 [43 AD], Tholos, son of Rabbomus, the president, at the great god’s expenses he built this” and “To the emperor Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus and the ancestral god Beelgalasos, under Gaius Cassius.” The whole site is entirely open, and anyone can wander in and around the ruin and the three smaller altars that surround it.

The scientists dubbed the baby mummy Yasmine and they eventually discovered four more babies, three adult women, the skull of a man, and one fetus that kept Yasmine company for the last 700 years. Yasmine was found with strands of hair in her toes, a local custom that continues today where a mother will pull out strands of her own hair while kissing the feet of her child’s corpse. Other artifacts from the cave - coins, ceramics, Syrian and Arabic manuscripts, household items - date the bodies to approximately 1283 AD. At that time, the region was known as the County of Tripoli, and the majority of its residents were Maronite Christians. Historically, the persecuted Maronites sought refuge in the Qadisha Valley’s many caves, and it is believed that the people found in the ‘Asi-al Hadath grotto died during a siege by Mamluk invaders from Egypt. The dry air and low humidity of the cave allowed the bodies to become naturally mummified; Yasmine and her companions lay there together, untouched and undiscovered, for seven hundred years. Today, the mummies can be found at the Lebanese National Museum in Beirut. Regrettably, they are in danger of deterioration. Even substances like phenol, which was designed to help preserve and protect the mummies, can be dangerous to them. Dramatic temperature changes, urban fumes, soot, dust, and pollution threaten the mummies more than natural conditions ever could.",lost tribes relics and reliquaries mummies cultures and civilizations rites and rituals
163,Moussa Castle,"Tahouitet El Ghadir, Lebanon","Lebanese castle built by one man, over a lifetime.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-moussa,"As a student, Lebanese Moussa Abdel Karim Al-Maamari had a tough time. Poor, he was beaten and mocked by a teacher who told him he would never amount to anything. Even his sweetheart ridiculed him, saying she would never marry him and that she planned to marry someone rich with a castle. It was at this moment that the dream took hold of Moussa’s 14-year-old mind. As a teenager, Moussa had the fortune to work with his uncle to restore a Lebanese castle. With the money he earned from restoring the castle and other museum work, a 20-year-old Moussa was able to begin work on what would become a lifelong project and obsession: his castle. Moussa bought land in the Shouf mountains between Deir Al-Qamar and Beit-Eddine and began building. Over the next 40 years, with only occasional help from neighboring peasants, Moussa hand-built his massive, sprawling castle. A fan of medieval architecture, Moussa’s is a true castle with a moat, drawbridge, and medieval-style ramparts. Inside, Moussa was as creative and eccentric, filling the castle with his gun collection, daggers, swords and Bedouin jewelry as well as wax figures depicting scenes from 1960s Lebanon including a room showing a teacher striking a student – a painful memory from Moussa’s childhood. Now in his seventies, Moussa has given his life to his dream, but without question he now qualifies for his high school sweetheart’s desire to marry “someone with a castle.” Moussa also wrote a book, “The Dream of My Life,” about building the castle. Moussa Castle is situated in the heart of the Shouf mountains between Deir Al-Qamar and Beit-Eddine at an altitude of 900m. It is 40 km away from Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.  If coming from Beirut, take the south highway leading to Sidon and Tyre.

164,Qurnat As Sawda,"Qurnat As Sawda, Lebanon","Lebanon's highest point offers expansive views, martian terrains, and eerie ski lifts.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qurnat-as-sawda,"Many mountains dwarf Qurnat as Sawda in size, but few can offer the experience of ascending such beautiful, untrodden terrain. Summiting this peak carries the added satisfaction of seeing a place few visitors to Lebanon ever experience themselves. Hiding in plain sight, shrouded by political unrest and pushed aside by cultural preference, hiking to the top of Lebanon’s highest point, one is more likely to pass a Bedouin camp with grazing ponies and sheep than a fellow outdoor enthusiast. The scenery along the way is spectacular. Expansive desert stretching to all sides is something to behold, especially the sharp juxtaposition of dry rocky soil and permanent snow fields classified as “alpine tundra.” Then, just nine miles east of Qurnat as Sawda’s summit, Mount Lebanon (the common term for the entire range), drops off more than 8,000 vertical feet, revealing breathtaking views and impressive cloudscapes. Hikers making the trek in early fall, summer, or late spring will encounter a significant bonus in the seasonally abandoned Cedar’s Ski Resort, whose empty chairlifts to nowhere look post-apocalyptic amidst their Martian surroundings. The hike itself should be easy enough for any moderately fit individual, but navigation poses something of a challenge. It is advised to thoroughly review online maps, all materials at one’s disposal, and the most recent political movements before departing. Moreover, no water is available after departing the town of Ariz, at the base of the Cedar’s resort, so pack plenty for the hike out and back. Helpful advice from ericharrisbernstein's firsthand experience:
""Good trail maps for As'Sawda are hard to come by. Available online topos are practically useless due to a complete lack of landmarks, trails, and roads. Having scoured the web, I think it best to eschew proper maps and do your research online. The trail that I followed on my ascent in the summer of 2010, and which is shown in some of the posted pictures, is obscured on google earth but was very easy to follow. The longitude/latitude of the summit, according to peakbagger.com, is 34 18'; 36 7' E, which places it about 3.5 miles Northwest of the peak of the northern-most chair lift of the Cedar's Ski Resort, which I have pointed out in a ski are map. It sounds a bit scattered and daunting, but I found it fairly easy to find when I was there (it is, after all, ""the tallest one"") From Bcharre, walk or take a cab east, towards Cedar's. There is only one road headed in that direction, and it is easy to identify - it is the one that goes up. It's about 11 km to the base of the resort, where your off-trail hike will begin. From the base, head up the main slope. There are switchbacks that make the loose rock easier to manage. It shouldn't take more than 90 minutes to get to the top of the lift and the isolated lift operator's shack pictured. We spent the night here and did not see a soul to give us trouble, but I would bet squatting is frowned upon. From the hut, the valley runs Northwest, funneling visitors to As'Sawda. After about 2.5 miles Northwest along the dirt valley road you will meet with a slightly more established dirt road that will take you another three quarters of a mile Northwest before heading North and a little East to the stout summit (although its prominence is listed around 2,400 m, it is a short jaunt from the valley to the top - from google earth, I estimate it is no more 700 vertical feet from the valley floor to peak), which is marked by a rickety metal structure.""",martian landscapes landscapes deserts sports mountains ecosystems

It was opened in May 2010, at the tenth anniversary of the Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, which ended the 18-year long occupation. Israel occupied the south of Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War after Israeli territory was repeatedly attacked by rockets fired from Southern Lebanon. A similar confrontation led to another Israeli invasion in 2006. Lebanon’s south is the heartland of Hezbollah, which is regarded as a terrorist organization by most countries. This museum certainly isn’t the only one with a one-sided portrayal of the Arab-Israeli conflicts within Lebanon, but it is presented in a very different way than other exhibitions of this kind. Housed in a modern lofty building with multimedia presentations, hands-on displays and labels in English, it is one of the most modern and best presented museums in the entire country. The exhibition contains numerous Israeli guns, weapons, and uniforms, on display at the main building. At the open-air section, a forest path leads through a former fighting zone, with weapons, hideouts and trenches still in place. The underground bunkers, where Hezbollah coordinated their offensives against the Israeli army, can also be visited. At the core of the museum is the so-called Abyss, a huge bomb crater, in which several Israeli tanks have been dumped. Dubbed “Disneyland for Jihadi fighters” and “Hezbollahland” by critics and Western media, the museum has been a source of controversy since its opening. It has drawn criticism because it presents a sanitized portrayal of war, and glorifies the Hezbollah fighters without mentioning the rest of the Lebanese population. The museum also ignores the Hezbollah attacks that caused the occupation in the first place. Nevertheless, the museum seems to be very successful and claims to have had more than 300,000 visitors in its first three months. Plans to expand the museum are underway, and include a cable car, a swimming pool and a hotel. Mlita, Muhafazat an-Nabatiya, Lebanon",jihadi museums museums and collections museums

It remained so until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War, a decade later, when the population of the city skyrocketed, as a huge number of mostly Christian Lebanese moved here to escape the horrors of the battlefields of Beirut. This large influx of people changed the fishing village into a large city with a population of more than 100,000, and changed the nature of the cable car completely. It wasn’t long until the green hills of Jounieh, on which the cable car was built, were covered in large apartment blocks to accomodate the huge waves of migrating people. The fighting stopped in 1990, but the city continues to thrive and is still one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Today, the cable car ascends between these apartment blocks – in parts just a couple of meters away from the buildings – which offers rather bizarre views into the apartments and onto the balconies of its inhabitants.

First of all, its figures are made of silicone, not wax, enabling animatronic components that allow figures to move and “speak.” And secondly, it’s the closest one can get to brushing shoulders with a slew of current, former, or perhaps soon-to-be-overthrown Arab leaders. Alongside an animatronic Saddam Hussein offering a handshake and the former Iraqi Information Minister Mohamad Said al-Sahhaf denying that U.S. troops had breached Iraqi borders in 2003, the museum features deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak holding court with Saudi King Abdullah and deceased leader of the Palestinian Authority Yasir Arafat. Considering Lebanon’s complex sectarian system of politics, it is surprising that nearly every faction is represented in silicon at the Hall of Fame. From the Druze leader Walid Jumblatt to the assassinated head of the Phalange party Bachir Gemayel, the only conspicuously absent figure is Hezbullah leader Hasan Nasrallah. Also popular at the Hall of Fame are silicone molds of Egyptian and Lebanese songstresses Um Kulthoum and Sabah, American presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and Albert Einstein.

Michel, Youssef, and Alfred Basbous were all born in Rachana, Lebanon, and never had plans to leave. Each brother was an enormously talented sculptor, and rather than try and break into the art world, they brought acclaim to the 1,000-person town that they never wanted to leave. The eldest brother Michel was the first to receive praise for his work, and began the tradition of creating open-air sculptures in Rachana. Using marble, stone and even wood, Michel created his art with his town in the background. His brothers continued to add to his works, but the town truly changed after Michel died, and his brothers invited sculptors from across the world for an international exhibition in 1994. Instead of simply debuting works at the exhibition, artists came and were asked to make a contribution to the ever-growing outdoor museum in Rachana.

Sinkholes are often the result of groundwater eating away at rocks like limestone and carbonate. Caverns form as the rocks dissolve, and eventually the ground above caves in, sometimes taking cars, houses, and even the occasional pizza place with it. In Northern Oman, just off the road between Dibab and Bimmah, there’s a particularly beautiful example of the natural phenomena. In an otherwise flat area, a sinkhole formed about a third of a mile from the sea, resulting in a turquoise mix of fresh and salt water. Geologists have confirmed the 65-foot deep pool is in fact a sinkhole, but locals hold on to the legend that a meteorite hit the spot. When the local municipality developed the area into a park to preserve and protect the hole, the name Haweat Najm (The Falling Star) Park was chosen. A large concrete staircase sticks out among the natural landscape, but offers a less precarious way down to the picturesque pool. Many folks just go to admire its beauty, or dip their feet in the vividly blue-green water for a fish-administered pedicure of sorts.

170,Chandelier at the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque,"Muscat, Oman",This spectacular mosque houses the second-largest chandelier in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sultan-qaboos-mosque-chandelier,"In 1992, Sultan Qaboos decided that Oman was in need of a grand mosque, and a competition was announced to select a design. The chosen plan was so enormous and grandiose, it took several years to build, and was finally inaugurated on May 4, 2001, to celebrate 30 years of the sultan’s reign. Built of Indian sandstone, the splendid structure is the second-largest mosque in the world, able to accommodate 20,000 worshippers at one time. The central dome rises 160 feet high, and the 4,200-square-foot floor is covered by a single piece of carpet handwoven by hundreds of artisans and colored with traditional vegetable dyes. But the pièce de résistance of this marvel of Islamic architecture is the gigantic chandelier hung high over the men’s prayer hall. At the time it was built, it was the largest indoor chandelier on Earth, and it is roughly the size of a small house. The sheer scale of this chandelier must be seen to be believed. The enormous bejeweled light measures 45 feet tall and 26 feet wide, and weighs around 9 tons. It’s decorated with 600,000 pieces of crystal trimmed with gold, and even has a small staircase inside it for workers to perform the maintenance needed to keep its 100-plus lamps shining bright. At the time the mosque was built, the chandelier and handwoven carpet were the largest in the world, but mosques in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have since installed bigger versions of each in order to beat the record. Regardless, the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque is a wonder that should not be missed during a visit to the Omani capital of Muscat. There is also a small information center inside the grounds of the mosque staffed by very friendly volunteers where you can ask any questions you may have about Islam over some coffee and dates.

171,Nakhal Fort,"Nakhl, Oman",An imposing Omani fortress surrounded by date palm trees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nakhal-fort,"Near the north coast of Oman, in the province of Nakhal, is a spectacular fortress that pre-dates the Islamic era. The pre-Islamic (the exact date is unknown) structure that was the foundation for later additions to Nakhal Fort was built around a large, oddly shaped boulder at the base of Mount Nakhal, which occasionally juts out into the fort’s interior. This is why the fort is an irregular shape. The fort has been renovated many times since its construction to protect nearby trade routes, most notably in the 9th and 17th centuries as well as in 1834 (when the walls, towers, and entranceway were built). There is a mosque on the first floor and residential and reception rooms on the upper level. The ceiling of one guest room features beautiful geometric designs and Arabic writing. From its history of use for defense, Nakhal Fort has acquired a collection of interesting features, including nooks over doorways where boiling cauldrons of honey or date juice would wait to be poured on invaders, and spiked doors for repelling battering rams. Today, the fort houses a museum with exhibits of historic guns and other artifacts. Every Friday at the fort there is a goat market. The view from the fort is mostly of date palm trees that fill the surrounding area, appropriate, since the fort’s name, Nakhal, translates to “palm.”",islam fortresses forts castles

173,Ubar,"Ubar, Oman","Some claim these desert ruins are from the legendary ""Atlantis of the Sands.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ubar,"Ubar is the Arabian equivalent of Atlantis, except that instead of sinking to the bottom of the sea, legend says it disappeared into the desert sands. It’s even been dubbed the “Atlantis of the Sands.” Ubar and Atlantis have something else in common, too—there’s no unanimous consensus that either ever even existed. Finding the skeleton of a city that perhaps never existed can be a daunting proposition, but explorers and scholars are well aware of the prestige they could gain should they discover the ruins. This is fertile ground, where legends and archaeological studies plant their seeds for wild speculations to grow. According to one of these speculations, the ruins of Ubar have been found in the village today known as Shisr in Dhofar Region, Oman. The ruins found in Shisr are officially named Ubar. Whether or not the ruins called Ubar in Shisr are actually the remains of the legendary Ubar is contested. Archaeological excavations suggest this outpost was involved in the incense trade, meaning it may have been a sizable settlement. The ruins suggest there used to be a fort surrounded by eight walls with a tower at each corner, a description that matches the description of the legendary Ubar in ancient documents. Furthermore, part of this fort collapsed when a sinkhole formed underneath, and several feet of sand eventually covered all the ruins. The fort in Shisr, therefore, literally sank into the desert sands. Sections of the fort still stand at the edge of the sinkhole and can be accessed by visitors. Other parts have sunk lower, but some are still clearly visible. At the deepest end of the sinkhole, a tunnel has been built that leads farther down underground, where the remains of sunken walls can be found. The reason why only the ruins of the fort have remained can be explained by the fact that people probably lived in tents at the time, and it was not uncommon for a fort to be the only permanent structure of a city.  Route 43 goes through Shisr, but it is not paved. A new paved road (yet unnamed) links Shisr to Road 31, a major artery running on a North/South axis. North of Ubar is the beginning of the Empty Quarter, the harshest and (arguably) most beautiful part of the Arabian Desert.",atlantis lost cities forts deserts ancient archaeology ruins
174,Snake Canyon,Oman,Nature's water park in the Wadi Bani Awf valley is full of pools flanked with cliffs and natural water slides.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snake-canyon,"Wadi Bani Awf stretches across the Hajjar Mountains, roughly between Nizwa and Rustaq. One of the largest valleys in Oman, it is dotted with picturesque villages, ruins, and natural wonders. One part of the valley, known as Snake Canyon, has been called Oman’s largest natural water park. Much of the valley’s length is through pools that can be jumped into from the high rocks or simply waded through, and there are several waterfalls and natural waterslides. This is an outdoor adventurer’s dream playground. Throughout Wadi Bani Awf, there are places where the colorful rock has been so worn down by rushing waters that it is incredibly smooth, and slippery even when dry. The cliffs on either side are extremely high and at times so narrow that a hiker can touch both sides at once. There is also a “Little” Snake Canyon, probably the narrowest part of the valley. This slim canyon features a 200-foot-long pool, which can get quite cold since the sun has trouble reaching through the narrow canyon opening. Travelers are warned that there are no easy escapes if they change their mind once they have started this trek through Snake Canyon. The canyon floods very quickly, so it is dangerous to be there in the rain. The Royal Oman Police constantly monitor the weather and warn adventurers not to risk their lives. People have drowned in the past. Beyond hiking, Wadi Bani Awf is known as a memorable off-road drive for people who are more motor-minded. It is also good for camping and rappelling.",pools cliffs waterfalls rivers natural wonders water nature
175,Beehive Tombs of Bat,"Ibri, Oman",Groups of prehistoric tombs that dot the mountains of Northern Oman.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beehive-tombs-of-bat,"More than 100 tombs stand defiantly on the hilltops of Northern Oman, all shaped like beehives. Little is known about the tombs, or the culture that constructed them, but they are thought to date from 3000 to 2000 B.C.E. All together they form one of the largest protohistoric necropoleis in the world. It is a bit difficult to spot the tombs at first, since they merge harmoniously with the hills they were built on, but upon closer inspection they are easily spotted. The tombs are arranged in three main clusters, the one in Bat, which is arguably the most famous, as well as the sites of al-Ayn and al-Khutm. The best preserved tombs of the site are the ones of the al-Ayn grouping. The earlier tombs of the site are simple structures, with only one entrance and one funerary chamber, and the later tombs have two entrances and up to four tomb chambers. Each of the tombs were built as collective burial places for this mysterious bronze-age culture. Besides the tombs, only a few artifacts give any clue to the culture, and are basically limited to a few arrowheads, daggers and water jugs. In 1988, the tombs were inscribed as a World Heritage Site.  Close to Ibri, Adh-Dhahirah Region, Oman. Surprisingly, it's not considered bad form to crawl into one of the tombs and explore. All burial artifacts are long-since gone, but locals sometimes use the tombs as overnight shelter. There's a significant lack of direction signs on how to get to each of these sites. In Bat, the main road goes around a long unfinished fence and you can go inside with your car or walk-in.",cultures and civilizations catacombs and crypts ruins
176,Wadi Dawkah Frankincense Trees,Oman,These gnarly desert trees produce the prized aromatic resin traded along the ancient incense trail.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wadi-dawkah-frankincense-trees,"Frankincense is one of those words with strong biblical associations and relatively little everyday use. That is, if you’re not in or from the Arabian Peninsula. Frankincense is a resin of the Boswellia sacra tree, more commonly referred to as the frankincense tree. These gnarled trees may not be the most majestic plants on earth, but they are extremely sturdy, and they can be tapped for their aromatic resin. Frankincense resin is used for the production of incense, perfumes, and essential oils, and it was a highly prized product in antiquity. This natural park of frankincense trees is located in Wadi Dawkah, an important stop along the ancient Frankincense Trail, an incense trade route that’s been used by merchants for millennia. Around 5,000 frankincense trees can be found in this desert valley, including some ancient specimen. Although frankincense trees can reach a height of 26 feet, most trees in Wadi Dawkah are no more than 10 feet high. Around age 8 to 10, frankincense trees are mature enough to be tapped. In April, when the temperatures are rising fast, the trees can recover from the tapping process. Using a putty knife, workers scrape the bark of the tree; the exact location and number of incisions per tree are dictated by the knowledge that has been passed down from one generation to the next. Resin oozes from the wound, which is left on the tree for two or three weeks to harden. The first harvest, however, is not usable. Workers will repeat the tapping process soon after the first harvest, and the second harvest yields the raw material for the production of incense and essential oils. The same goes for the third and final tapping of the season. A mature healthy tree can produce around 7 to 9 pounds (3 to 4 kg) of frankincense a year. Unfortunately, frankincense trees have drastically decreased in number over the years due to over-exploitation. The natural park in Wadi Dawkah has the dual purpose of protecting the existing trees and growing new ones in order to increase the population of frankincense trees in the wadi.  The natural park is located about 40 km north of Salalah along Route 31. It is part of the Land of Frankincense UNESCO site, which also includes a museum and ancient ruins.",spices unesco trails trees ancient parks plants nature history

The Indian Ocean trade route brought many people through the ancient city, which Italian explorer Marco Polo described as having “fine bazaars and one of the most beautiful mosques.” In the late-Middle Ages, when it was Oman’s first capital, the city was notably encircled by a fortified wall and was bustling with shops, bazaars, and houses. But when trade in the area shifted to Muscat, Oman’s current capital, Qalhat began its decline into obscurity. It was eventually captured by the Portuguese in 1507. Today, a single mausoleum is all that bears witness to the city’s former glory. Some say the lonely tomb was built by Baha al-Din Ayaz, king of the Hormuz Empire, for his wife, Bibi Maryam.

Seen from the distance, this mountain village is a remarkable sight, as its verdant gardens sit in stark contrast with the rocky, rugged, and arid valley. First of all, Misfat al Abriyyin (also spelled Misfat al Abriyeen) consists of an interesting amalgam of traditional mud houses and more recent additions and renovations. The houses are packed together, and above narrow alleyways the buildings are connected. The alleys are interspersed with uneven steps and steep ramps, with narrower passageways branching off to a house or the gardens. Seen from the garden, it’s possible to appreciate the architectural feat of building multi-story houses perched on boulders. Although some of the older buildings are abandoned, Misfat al Abriyyin is a living village. The residents here make a living from the gardens, and to a lesser extent, tourism. Thickets of date palm trees cover the terraces, surrounded for miles by barren rocks. Agriculture in the village has succeeded through the centuries thanks to a traditional Omani irrigation system known as aflaj, underpinned by a communal understanding of natural resources. There is archaeological evidence that aflaj was used in Oman as early as 5,000 years ago. It is a simple but effective way of using water, in which water sources found uphill are channeled through a village and its adjacent gardens.  Misfat al Abriyyin is located 34 miles (55 km) northwest of Nizwa. A paved road leads to the village, but the village itself can only be explored on foot, as it consists of narrow passageways up and down the steep slopes of the hill. Signs at the entrance of the village request visitors to dress modestly (i.e. long trousers/skirts and no bare shoulders), to refrain from smoking and drinking alcohol, and to not pick fruit. Basic accommodation and food is available in Misfat al Abriyyin. A shop at the entrance of the village sells local produce, such as honey and date syrup.",agriculture villages tradition mountains gardens plants architecture
179,Nizwa Fort,"Nizwa, Oman",This beautifully restored fortification kept the city safe for centuries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nizwa-fort,"In the heart of the ancient city of Nizwa, lies Oman’s most visited national monument. The Nizwa Fort was constructed over a preexisting structure that dates back to the 12th century. However, the structure on display today was constructed around the 1600s and took around 12 years to complete. Nizwa Fort stood as the administrative seat of power for various Imams and Walis during times of conflict and peace. The fort is a shining example of the amazing architectural advancements that took place during the Ya’rubi era. The Nizwa Fort has the added prestige of possessing the tallest tower attached to a fort in Oman. The tower also employed various techniques to disrupt enemy invasions such as false doors, cannons, secret shafts, and narrow staircases. There are also several pitfalls located around the fort’s dark passageways to surprise enemy intruders. Today, these attributes are on display for tourists, while the turret offers splendid views of Nizwa. A short walk from the fort lies the bustling Nizwa Souk, where a large collection of clay pottery and souvenirs unique to Oman can be purchased. While used for centuries as a tool of war and defense, today, the Nizwa Fort stands as a beautiful and strong tribute to Oman’s often turbulent history.",war forts military history architecture

The base of the cave is 624,000 square feet, the size of nearly 11 football fields. However the only way to get in is through one of three tiny openings at the top, all of which have been formed over time as the accumulation of rainwater dissolved the limestone covering. This cave chamber, located 60 miles from Muscat, was discovered by Americans Don Davidson Jr. and his wife Cheryl Jones in 1983. They noticed the strange holes in the ground on aerial photographs, and eventually made the journey out via helicopter. When they looked down into the small openings, they saw the sandy floor below - over 500 feet down. Just days later, they rappelled down for the first time. In an attempt to find an appropriate name for the chamber, they asked the Omanis in the surrounding area if they had a local name for it, to which the response was no. They did, however, mention that they believed that the cave was filled with genies, which are prevalent in Omani mythology and the Quran. In Arabic, the word for “genie” is “al-Jinn”, so hence, the American explorers named the cave is “Majlis al Jinn. “Majlis” means “meeting place,” making the cave name, “the meeting place of the genies.” Now accessible by four wheel drive automobiles, this cave room has become a hot spot for abseilers and BASE jumpers. A small hole at the top sheds a beam of light into the vast base. Strangely, the bottom of this chamber appears to be a sort of graveyard for goats (who presumably fell in), snakes, and birds - their bones littering the floor.",extreme sports islam skeletons caves ecosystems

For a handful of British soldiers in the mid-1800s, being stationed “around the bend” was the worst place you could possibly be, a lonely island outpost where soldiers slowly lost their minds in the desert heat. From 1864 to 1869, Jazirat al Maqlab, or “Telegraph Island,” was an active telegraph outpost crucial to communication between India and Britain. For five years after the telegraphy was decommissioned, British soldiers continued to man the isolated outpost. Reportedly, every single man stationed at the outpost “around the bend” of the Musandam peninsula completely lost his mind from the monotony and heat. Stuck for months on the football-field sized island, cut off from the outside world, and subject to intense desert heat, the solders were slowly driven mad. Today the island is a ghostly remnant of the once-great British Empire. The outpost was abandoned in the mid-1870s, and the buildings have crumbled. The island now serves as a snorkeling and fishing destination rather than a strategic communication hub, but the oppressive heat and the lonely atmosphere that helped drive the soldiers “around the bend” remains.

182,Tayq Sinkhole,"Tayq, Oman",A powerful cyclone once made one of the world's largest sinkholes completely fill with water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tayq-sinkhole,"Because of the geological structure of the subsoil, there’s a wealth of sinkholes scattered all over the Arabian Peninsula. Tayq Sinkhole’s claim to fame rests on its size, as it’s one of the largest sinkholes in the world. It’s so big it resembles a deep wadi, or ravine. The sinkhole measures about half a mile across and its lowest point is 820 feet deep. Like other sinkholes, Tayq was caused by water dissolving the karst limestone in the subsoil until the top layer of soil eventually collapsed. In this case, the water was fed by rivers running along Wadi Sharaa and Wadi Thirrat, which join at Tayq. In May 2018, Cyclone Mekunu hit the region with extreme winds and rainfall. Five times the average amount of annual rainfall poured on the area over four days, causing floods and massive damage. During this time, so much water flowed into Tayq that it filled the whole sinkhole. It’s speculated that water slowly flowed to the sea via caves connecting Tayq Sinkhole to Tawi Atayr Sinkhole (five miles away) and the coast (nine miles away). You can reach the bottom of the sinkhole via a steep path from the southern side, but if you approach the sinkhole from the main road, there is no way to reach the bottom other than abseiling from the edge. Local villagers undertake this hair-raising task when there is a drought and they need to fetch water from the cave at the bottom of the sinkhole. For those seeking an adrenaline rush, take caution: the ropes to hold onto are cheap and worn, and there’s no-one stopping you from tempting your fate.  Taiq Sinkhole is 73 km East of Salalah. Coming from Salalah, a road branches off Route 49 soon after the town of Taqah. Tayq Sinkhole is sometimes referred to as Tayq Cave on road signs.",sinkhole geological oddities geology nature
183,Dhow Factory of Sur,"Sur, Oman",Where artisans use centuries-old techniques to build traditional Arabian ships.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dhow-factory-of-sur,"The city of Sur on the Gulf of Oman is one of the most historic boat-building centers in Arabia. And today, artisans still hand-craft dhows of all sizes at the factory in Sur, using centuries-old techniques. By the sixth century, the city of Sur had become an important center for trade with East Africa. Later, its reach expanded all across the Arabian Sea. Boats, naturally, were a vital part of life in Sur, and a thriving ship-building industry developed in the port city. Sur became famous as a center for the construction of dhows, the generic name given to a range of traditional Arabian sailing vessels, typically fitted with one or two masts and lateen rigging. Once built, these wooden ships would sail all across the region, to the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the coast of East Africa and across to India and China, trading precious stones, pepper, sandalwood, camphor, cloves, cinnamon, ambergris, ivory, and more. They were also used to carry slaves. Sur’s role at the center of these trade routes faded over the years, especially after the construction of the Suez Canal. The number of dhows built also decreased considerably, but the ship-building tradition remains intact at its dhow factory. The factory produces only two or three large dhows at any given time. They are made from Burma teak and ghaff, a local desert tree, and are built to order. And while modern methods are now used in the construction process, many traditional techniques still remain. It’s not unusual to see a builder using a bow drill instead of an electric drill, and workers moving planks by rolling them over logs. Blueprints and schematics are also rare, if used at all, as all the knowledge for building these vessels is contained within the heads of the local shipbuilders. Today, most of the ships are destined for the tourism industry rather than a life along the trade routes, and some are commissioned by notable individuals. King Abdullah of Jordan  had his dhow made here, along with other sheikhs and sultans. Tim Severin, the British explorer and historian, also came to the dhow factory prior to his epic “Sindbad Voyage.” The factory built his ship, the Sohar, an 87-foot replica of a ninth-century, lateen-rigged, cotton-sailed Arab dhow, which he then sailed from Sur to India and on to China. As for the legendary Sinbad the Sailor himself, some scholars have argued that he came from Oman, others from Baghdad and elsewhere, if he ever even existed at all. But if he did come from Oman, then there’s a good chance he sailed a dhow from Sur during his adventurous seven voyages.  The dhow factory of Sur is located just south of the western end of the Khor Al Batah suspension bridge. The factory isn’t large, so you can see everything in less than an hour, unless you want to sit around and soak up the atmosphere for longer. Don’t miss the beautiful scale models that the artisans also make and put on display in the factory shop. For more about the history of dhow construction, head to the nearby Al Qanjah Boat Yard, where you’ll find the Sur Maritime Museum.",factories boats

It is, therefore, somewhat surprising to find 3 square km of desert fenced off and signposted “Rock Garden.”  If you leave behind any preconceived ideas of what a garden may look like, and focus instead on the rock part of the name, you’ll be better prepared for the site. At first sight, there is little (if any) difference between the fenced off and the surrounding area.  Yet, once you start wandering around, you’ll find a curious array of sandstone and limestone formations. Water, wind and millions of years combined managed to create this bizarre landscape. Almost perfectly spherical stones sit next to rocks resembling animals, thrones, human body parts, and whatever else your imagination can conjure up. Some large rocks stand balanced on smaller ones, while others sit at improbable angles. It may not be the most jaw-dropping site you’ll ever see, but it does provide the chance to marvel at the beauty of rocks.  There is something hypnotic about contemplating the way time has made some rocks smooth, and others jagged, some flaky and others scaly, and so on. If you take time to notice these little variations, the Rock Garden has a striking variety of rock surfaces, shapes, and colors.  There is no office or information on site.  There are plans to develop this site to attract tourism, but at the time of writing, you’re more likely to come across lizards, geckos, and skinks than tourists.

Leaving behind the dazzling city skyline and heading in southwest, you encounter the kind of desert that is more akin to “Mad Max” than romantic rolling dunes. This is not to say the place is devoid of charm, but this is a different kind of charm. At any given time, the gigantic scrapyard accommodates around 20,000 vehicles, including cars, jeeps, trucks, buses, excavators, loaders, bulldozers, cement mixers, cranes, and other construction equipment. There are also motorbikes, dune buggies, water scooters, boats, and nearly every means of transportation that you can think of. These vehicles can be relatively new, old, vintage, or ancient. They can be pristine, dented, neglected, partly wrecked, completely wrecked, or burnt beyond recognition. Walking through the endless rows of dust-covered vehicles is an eerie experience that evokes post-apocalyptic imageries. There is a sense of beauty in the fact that each vehicle was once valued and perhaps even treasured, and now it is quite literally collecting dust, awaiting to be transformed and reborn as something other than itself. You cannot help but pause and admire. On average, a vehicle stays in the scrapyard for four months, during which attempts are made to contact the registered owner. If no one reclaims the vehicle, it is usually demolished and compacted, ready to be recycled and reused—usually for construction purposes. Vintage vehicles do not usually undergo this process, but are kept in a separate section of the yard, and once a year an auction is held to sell them off to the highest bidders. The scrapyard is a perfectly legal enterprise run under the surveillance of the state police. Visits are not encouraged, but they are not actively discouraged either (as yet). At the entrance, there are several bungalow-like offices. Even if the guards are not present, it is implicitly required that visitors report themselves to the authorities upon entering. An authorized escort accompanies visitors to the scrapyard. It should be understood that this is not a guide in the common sense of the term. His or her presence is to ensure the safety of the visitors, and perhaps, that nothing gets stolen. It may not seem the most direct route, but the easiest way to reach the scrapyard is actually by heading west along Salwa Road, and then heading south following the signs for Mesaieed. Along the way, there is an exit for Al Wukair, which leads directly to the scrapyard.

187,Musfur Sinkhole,Qatar,Climb down into the largest sinkhole in Qatar.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/musfur-sinkhole,"The Musfur Sinkhole was formed an estimated 325,000 to 500,000 years ago. The opening is about 40 feet wide and plunges over 300 feet down into the earth, making it the largest sinkhole in Qatar. Unlike many sinkholes, there are no bats living inside this giant cave, but migratory birds regularly build their nests high along the jagged layers of limestone and gypsum. The ancient sinkhole is also crawling with bugs native to Qatar but in a highly concentrated number, pointing at an ecosystem inside the hole that is quite different from the one found on the surface. Sinkholes are common throughout the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, where the terrain is particularly conducive to these phenomena. The whole region is characterized by karst, a geological term referring to the underground layer of land that can easily dissolve when water trickles down from the surface, forming cavities.  When these cavities grow in size and can no longer support the land surface, a collapse may occur and a sinkhole is formed. Rainfall in the region is relatively negligible nowadays, but during the Middle Pleistocene period, heavy rainfalls were common, and this is the time when Musfur Sinkhole probably formed. Other factors also affect the way sinkholes are formed (like temperature change, topsoil structure, flora, and fauna), but water is definitely the most determining factor, as it directly dissolves limestone and gypsum. While there is also a cave a few miles from Musfur, this is a standalone sinkhole, and it is not itself connected to other caves.  Follow Salwa Road and take exit 35 heading north. Follow the main road for about 10 km and take an eastbound dirt road following the powerlines. Musfur Sinkhole is on this dirt track, about 12 km from the paved road. It is easy to spot as it is the only piece of land surrounded by a chain-link fence. Note that sinkholes are not the safest places to be as they are inherently unstable and other sections of soil or subsoil may collapse.

188,Al Thakira Mangroves Forest,Qatar,A mesmerizing wonderland of salt-encrusted tree branches and pencil roots.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-thakira-mangroves-forest,"Al Thakira Mangrove Forest is among Qatar’s oldest and largest such forests. It’s a welcome surprise to find a mangrove forest like this such a short distance from industrial Al Khor. Considering the harsh environment, there aren’t many plants endemic to Qatar, and mangroves are one of these sturdy few. The local type of mangrove native to the country is the Avicennia Marina (aka white or gray mangrove), a species that can endure the high level of salinity that’s characteristic of the Persian Gulf. Mangroves are a unique ecosystem both above and below water. Beneath the water’s surface, tree branches get covered with salt, seaweed, and tiny seashells. Part of the mangroves’ underground roots are equipped with snorkels, known as pencil roots, that enable them to absorb air during high tide. With high tide, fish swim through branches and pencil roots. The ecosystem attracts migratory birds such as herons and flamingos. Numerous types of fish and crustaceans are visible throughout the year.  Only about five miles (8 kilometers) from the city of Al Khor, Al Thakira Mangrove Forest can be reached by car. This requires a 1.2-mile (four-kilometer) off-road ride through compacted sand and salt flats. The dirt track ends on the beach where the mangrove forest begins. There are no signs and no facilities nearby. Pencil roots spread up to 33 feet (10 meters) for the tree trunk, and they usually form a close-knit pattern. Stepping on pencil roots would damage them, probably resulting in the demise of the mangrove tree. It is, therefore, advised not to walk through the mangrove forest.

189,National Museum of Qatar,"Doha, Qatar",The building is a gigantic piece of art inspired by the shape of a desert rose.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-museum-of-qatar,"The interlocking discs of this museum’s exterior give the feeling that they are randomly placed at odd angles. But in reality, the design was inspired by the desert rose, a crystallized mineral formation found in salt basins. Yet for those who are unfamiliar with desert roses, the building would not be misplaced in a sci-fi movie where several space saucers smashed into one another. Either way, the institution cannot fail to impress. Completed and opened in 2019, the National Museum of Qatar re-tells the story of how Qatar evolved through time, from a geological and biological perspective and from the standpoint of human history. Over an area of 170,000 square feet, the combination of traditional displays of items and multimedia makes a memorable experience. Renowned architect Jean Nouvel is the mastermind behind this striking building. Apart from having architectural aesthetic value, the disks have other functions, such as protecting visitors against the scorching heat of the summer. By protruding from the main body of the building, they work as veritable awnings and create oddly shaped apertures that offer views of the surrounding area. Another function of the disks is that even if they look randomly placed, they are actually part of an architectural strategy to support and reinforce the structure by transferring the strain of its weight evenly to the foundations. Taken as a whole, the building draws an elliptical circuit around the historical palace of Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar during the first part of the 20th century. The interior design of the museum mirrors its striking exterior appearance, taking visitors along pathways and exhibition rooms created by the interlocking disks. The walls are, therefore, sloping in different directions and at different angles, with the floor slightly rising and falling as if to follow the internal structure of a desert rose. Masterful interior design made the most of this unconventional space. In addition to the exhibition rooms, in the building are also a 220-seat auditorium, a research center, laboratories, restaurants, cafes, and other shops. Around the museum is a garden with fountains, and it is connected to the nearby corniche via two pedestrian bridges.  The National Museum of Qatar is located on the South side of the corniche. It's impossible to miss and is open daily.",roses museums and collections museums architecture
190,Al Shahaniya Camel Racetrack,"Ash-Shahaniyah, Qatar",Robot jockeys ride their humped mounts to victory as part of a 21st-century twist on an ancient desert sport.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-shahaniya-camel-racetrack,"People have raced camels for thousands of years. But in recent decades, the popular desert spectacle has received a 21st century twist: robot jockeys. The weight of a jockey, obviously, affects the animals’ speeds. In the past, children as young as four years old were used as jockeys in several countries that host camel races. The introduction of robot jockeys is, therefore, not only about camel speed, but also about human rights. In 2005, child jockeys were banned in Qatar. Even before the official ban, robot jockeys had been steadily replacing human riders. Other countries in the region made similar moves, turning the ancient sport of camel racing into a strange fusion of animal and technological power. The robot jockeys are little more than remote-controlled mechanical whips. If, however, you add a speaker to the contraption so that the owner can “encourage” the camel to run faster and cover the whole apparatus with some racing silks, well, the image of a robot jockey is not too far off. The Al Shahaniya track hosts tournaments where camels run races of varying lengths. Depending on how many batches of camels compete, the competitions usually last from 1.5 hours to three or more. Depending on the length of the race and the speed of the camels, each race lasts about 10 to 15 minutes. As the camels run, a convoy of cars follows them along a road that hugs the racing track. The cars are packed with owners, trainers, and spectators cheering on their favorite entries.",races robots technology sports animals

Up its rickety steep staircase however, hides a sultan’s bounty of finely crafted Arabian carpets, and the trade of Doha’s notorious Rug Man. Known across this desert emirate for his trade in rare rugs from across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, Riyaz Bhat, will educate the curious customer on the finer points of rug purchasing and carpet artistry. With all the skill of a showman Bhat will unfold the 1,600 knot-per-square-inch silk rugs handcrafted by his own family, smooth as velour, and tell you the tales of origin for every intricate design on its surface. His family has been producing intricate silk carpets for generations. Bhat might also tell you of his adventures through Kashmir and Afghanistan—interchangeable license plates, millions of rupees in cash, and trading of rugs against Yaqoob and Karakul Sheep through dangerous situations. Be sure to budget several hours examine his treasures from around the globe, as Bhat’s lectures will be punctuated by chances to slip out of your shoes and take a test walk across some of the artful tapestries.

For more than a century, they’ve provided a vantage point for both scanning the horizon for enemies and tracking the movements of the celestial world. The towers were built in the late 1800s and renovated in 1910 during the reign of Sheikh Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani. They served a dual purpose: In addition to being watchtowers installed to ward off off the possibility of another Ottoman invasion, the towers were also a site for astronomical observations. It was here where astronomers studied the Moon during Ramadan. The Barzan Towers compound comprises of two towers, a small mosque, and a reception room for guests. Both towers have a rectangular base reinforced by buttresses at the corners. Their walls, which are approximately three feet wide, are made of local coral and limestone held together by mud and covered by gypsum-based plaster. The towers were strategically placed near a rawdat, an ecosystem where rainwater collects and allows indigenous flora and fauna to grow. In the arid climate of Qatar, rawdats are particularly valuable areas. But sadly, little of the rawdat is visible today, as the surrounding area has witnessed extensive urban development. It’s possible to enter the tower and climb the internal staircase to reach the top level. The thickness of the walls and the small windows ensure a cool temperature inside the towers all year round.",astronomy fortresses intriguing environs towers ecosystems
194,Al Jassasiya Petroglyphs,Qatar,A staggering number of rock carvings in an abandoned quarry.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-jassasiya-petroglyphs,"Al Jassasiya may appear to be just a deserted quarry—and it is—but look carefully and you’ll find a wealth of mysterious petroglyphs. First reported in 1956 by Danish archaeologist Peter Glob, a total of more than 900 rock carvings can be found at this surprising site. The petroglyphs of Al Jassasiya were first studied in 1964. The most common motifs are round holes reminiscent of cup holders, and what they represent is unknown. Some are carved in seemingly random order, while others are in patterns, such as rows, double rows, and rosettes. Aside from the round holes, there are also carvings of dhows, fish, scorpions, ostriches, and quadrupeds. There is no unanimous consensus as to the age of these petroglyphs. The most conservative estimates maintain they are a few centuries old, while more bold estimates suggest they date back millennia. The purpose or symbolism of the petroglyphs is also a source of speculation. It’s been suggested the round holes could have been used to store pearls, which used to be traded extensively in the region, or perhaps to play a board game. An alternative view is that the positioning of the round holes represents constellations, but even if this were true, the mystery remains as to why they were created in the first place.  Drive north of Doha on Al Shamal Road and take the Ras Laffan exit. Follow the road for 8 km and take a turn left. Al Jassasiya is about 3 km along this road. The main site is on the left, but there are also some petroglyphs on the right of the main road. The site is fenced off but there are several gates to enter. Once you’re inside, there are no obvious signs as to where the petroglyphs can be found. Most of them are located along the ridge that runs along the main road.",quarries petroglyphs mystery ancient abandoned
195,Inland Sea,Qatar,"The shallow, salty inlet was a safe haven for 19th-century pirates.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/inland-sea,"An enormous pool of shallow, salty water lies within a great expanse of sunkissed sand dunes. It’s a strange environment, made even more fascinating by its history as a pirate stronghold. Inland Sea (Khawr al Udayd) is a sea inlet of the Persian Gulf that straddles the border between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Due to low rainfall and high temperatures, the water is saltier than the nearby gulf. Pirates from Abu Dhabi used the super salty body of water as refuge during the 1800s. It’s easy even for the untrained eye to see that anyone attempting to navigate the shallow waters would have to be familiar with the strange environment and possess remarkable seafaring skills. The pirates had both familiarity with the area and a knack for navigation, guaranteeing them a substantial degree of safety while they remained within the inlet. They became so problematic that the British Navy was sent in to deal with the issue. Unfortunately, the Navy’s involvement and presence in the area only increased the already high tensions between Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Pirates weren’t the only ones who found a haven within this salty sea inlet. The encroachment of the hypersaline waters into the desert gave birth to a unique ecosystem, both above and below water. Different kinds of sea turtles, ospreys, cormorants, flamingos, desert foxes, and oryx drop by. Human visitors exploring during low tide are likely to find fossils of gastropods, bivalves, corals, sea worms, and more. The remoteness of the Inland Sea is immediately palpable upon leaving Mesaieed, the nearest settlement. The comfort of driving on paved roads gives way to the thrills of navigating across rolling dunes and salt flats, which are sometimes interrupted by rough patches that resemble gravel. A visit during high tide means seeing the dunes gently sloping into the sea. Low tide, on the other hand, reveals a terrain covered by microbial mats that draw interesting patterns within the crystal clear water of the inlet.  Attractive as the Inland Sea may seem, it is not a destination for a casual outing. A 4x4 vehicle is necessary, and tires should be deflated to 18-20 psi prior to leaving Mesaieed. Although other vehicles will probably stop and help if need be, going as part of a convoy is by far the safest option. There are also tour companies that offer half-day, full-day, or overnight visits.",pirate strongholds wonders of salt dunes sea pirates environment intriguing environs ecosystems water

The peninsula is, by and large, uninhabited, with the exception of a small village, a Coast Guard Post, an ostrich farm, and a fort called “Film City,” purposely built for movie production. Of a more transient nature, camel and goat herders can also be encountered in the area. The most prominent feature of Bir Zekreet’s landscape is the presence of large escarpments, with pillars and mushroom-like limestone formations. This unusual geology is the result of strong winds blowing away softer sedimentary rock, leaving behind just the harder limestone skeleton exposed. The region is also a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, with a special interest in oryx and gazelles. Research in the reserve includes the use of saline water for irrigation, the creation of grazing grounds, camel farming, and low-impact tourism. North of Film City, and part of the locations created for production, is a particularly photogenic escarpment with a handful of stone huts, one of which is built on top of a stand-alone natural pillar. Although they look like it, none of these little buildings are ancient. But they do make for good, quirky photo opportunities.  Bir Zekreet is on the west coast of Qatar, about 60 miles northwest of Doha. There is no public transportation to get there, so the best and safest way is with a guide, a 4x4 vehicle and a healthy amount of food and water. Best if NOT visited after a rain fall, as mud can make the trip particularly hazardous. Note that the film set ""fort"" is not the ancient 9th century Murwab Fort (Zekreet Fort), which is not far. The truly ancient fort is a protected site, and cannot be accessed without special permissions and archaeological guides.",film locations deserts geological oddities geology

Bin Jelmood stands out from the others, however. It is dedicated to raising awareness of human bondage, and celebrating human resilience in the face of unthinkable hardship. The exhibition highlights the role that slavery has played in the development of civilizations throughout human history. Bin Jelmood House does not shy away from acknowledging that Qatar and other Gulf countries were not innocent bystanders. Indeed, Bin Jelmood House was an apt choice for the exhibition, as this house, like many others, once used enslaved laborers. The exhibition invites visitors to view the world through the eyes of those that fell victim to the slave trade. Harrowing tales bring to life the inner and outer struggle of those in bondage whose humanity was denied and repressed. From servants to pearl divers, resilience is the inner force that guides their existence. As history unfolds as you make your way through the museum, the emphasis shifts to the various efforts that eventually led to emancipation and the abolition of slavery. Yet, this is not a journey with a happy ending, as the exhibit ends with a display of modern forms of globalized slavery, encompassing human trafficking, bonded labour, and the current practice of “contract slavery” still in existence in the Gulf and elsewhere. The message is loud and clear: We are all complicit, and it will take a collective effort to rid the world of this plague. Not all countries are willing to acknowledge the role they have played in the slave trade through the centuries, and the role that slavery played in their development. With Bin Jelmood House, Qatar is confronting its dark past, rather than turning a blind eye on how the country came to be.",slavery museums history
198,Al `Arish,Qatar,An abandoned fishing village in pre-oil Qatar.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-arish,"Though its name (which comes from the Arabic word for “palm trees”) conjures images of an idyllic spot sheltered by the leafy fronds of date palms, this abandoned village is far from a verdant oasis. Abandoned villages once inhabited by fisherman and pearl drivers speckle the coast of northern Qatar. They’re usually small, at times boasting no more than five or six houses. Al `Arish (sometimes spelled Al-Areesh) is one of the largest, with approximately 40 buildings in all. Very few of the village’s structures have survived the test of time, and those that have bear the brunt of the unforgiving desert weather. A casual stroll through the village ruins reveals locally sourced pieces of coral rock and limestone held together by mud mortar to make thick walls built to protect against heat and windstorms. Some buildings are still capped by roofs made of closely knitted mangrove branches stacked atop bamboo poles, all slathered in another layer of mud mortar. The minaret is the best preserved remain. Though badly cracked, it still stands tall among the rubble of the surrounding buildings. Its spiralling staircase still exists, making a winding climb to the top possible though definitely not advisable. The clearly identifiable remains of the demolished walls of the mosque, the room for ablutions, and the outer wall of the mosque yard are scattered around its base. It seems that Al `Arish and its kindred villages were alive and well up to the 1970s, when the first oil reservoir was found under Qatari soil. This discovery revolutionized the economy that sustained people in Qatar for centuries. As people no longer had to face the daily hardship of fishing and diving, proximity to the sea became irrelevant.

200,Qatar National Library,"Doha, Qatar",The enormous diamond-shaped building packs a trove of academic and literary treasures into one futuristic space.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qatar-national-library,"When viewed from its main entrance, this futuristic-looking library takes the shape of an enormous diamond. Huge undulating glass panels cover the vast majority of all the building’s sides, letting natural light in while keeping the heat out. Inside, the building is expansive, with a high sloping ceiling and multi-layered bookshelves that give the feeling of being in an amphitheater stuffed with intriguing titles. The Qatar National Library (QNL) was designed by renowned Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. The 484,375-square-foot building opened in November 2017 and is now an absolute trove of literary and academic treasures. QNL is a combination of various collections, which seem to function as their own mini libraries. One collection includes the University and Research Library, which aims to support academic research in all fields of study. Another part holds the works within Metropolitan Public Library, which caters to the general public and includes dedicated mini libraries for children and teens. Lastly, the Heritage Library contains ancient Arabic publications and manuscripts, historical maps, scientific instruments, and early photographs of the region. This particular part is especially dedicated to both preserving and studying these fascinating finds. Combined, the these three collections contain more than one million books, periodicals, and other items. Interestingly, the design of the building does not separate the distinct collections. Visitors are encouraged to move freely from one section to the other and can drift between the various webs of knowledge with complete fluidity. Among other innovative features, QNL is equipped with a visible state of the art automatic book sorting system that uses a technology known as overall radio-frequency identification (RFID). This high tech system explains the ubiquity of signs instructing users not to replace books on the shelves, as the library prefers to let machines handle the sorting and stocking to make sure everything’s where it should be.  The library is open to the public, and anyone with a Qatari ID can apply and obtain free membership. Besides being able to borrow books, members will also gain access to online international academic databases and specialized journals. In addition to study rooms, computers, and photocopying machines, visitors can make full use of musical instruments and 3D printers.",libraries books architecture
201,Pearl Monument,"Doha, Qatar","This fountain pays homage to Qatar's history of pearling, the primary industry before oil.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pearl-monument,"While oil has made Qatar rich—it boasts the highest per capita income in the world—the tiny Gulf nation hasn’t forgotten its seafaring roots. Prior to the discovery of oil in 1939, pearling was one of Qatar’s primary revenue streams. Not only is it a gamble—approximately one in 10,000 oysters contains a pearl—it was extremely dangerous due to the toll diving took on the body, coupled with the constant threat of lingering barracudas, sea snakes, and sharks nearby. The pearl’s significance is still honored throughout Qatar today. There is a giant Pearl Monument in Doha, a luxury artificial island called The Pearl was built on one of the nation’s major pearl-diving sites, and the annual Qatar Marine Festival showcases pearling methods as well as its history. And located on Corniche Street, just before entering Dhow Harbor, stands the Pearl Monument. The fountain sculpture depicts a giant open oyster presenting a massive pearl in its mouth. This fountain, which lights up at night, provides an ideal photo opportunity while paying homage to Qatar’s pearling history. Pearl diving was a seasonal activity and profession that took place between June and September each year. Divers and crews would set out on a two-month-long journey as well as a 40-day journey in the hopes of returning with a plentiful bounty. But as Japan began cultivating pearl beds and creating oyster farms in the mid-1920s, pearl prices decreased. Coupled with the discovery of oil, Qatar’s priorities underwent a massive shift, and, as they say, the rest is history.

After decades of digging, the quarry has become a largely barren landscape with deep canals and high ridges. Umm Bab is primarily known for its beach, but it’s also home to a historic business. Back in 1965, Qatar National Cement Company started its operations here, and to date, it’s still operational. The location was not randomly chosen. Umm Bab was selected due to its large and easily accessible quantities of limestone and clay. About 12 miles (20 kilometers) south of the settlement of Umm Bab is the clay quarry. Clay excavation started in the 1960s, and it’s also still ongoing. Strangely, the excavator-operators began digging around some trees. This seemingly arbitrary action was then replicated during the next phase of the excavation, and so on. After decades, the result is the presence of 20-to-30-foot-tall towers of clay, with solitary spindly trees sitting at the very tops. The other prominent feature of the quarry is the mounds of discarded soil piled up in neat, straight rows. Strong wind and sandstorms have turned these mounds into perfectly rounded hills surrounded by vast expanses of flatland.  As no public transport comes to the quarry, you’ll need your own mode of transportation, preferably a sturdy 4x4. Please note that the quarry is operational, and there is a constant flow of trucks coming, loading, and leaving. There are no paved roads or signs, and size matters. Driving a private vehicle, it’s your responsibility to get out of the trucks’ way. The terrain can be treacherous, especially when wet. Avoid all puddles, which can easily turn into quicksand under pressure exercised by a vehicle. Parts of the quarry have guarded post-blocks that may or may not grant access to non-authorized people. To avoid trucks, the best bet is to visit the quarry on Friday mornings, which also means that you’ll be alone, should anything go wrong with your vehicle.",clay quarries intriguing environs ecosystems

If you beat the crowds, you’ll get a glimpse of real harbor life, with laborers busy maintaining the vessels and others unloading the previous night’s catch. Al Wakrah is city about a 10-minute drive from Doha. A 1903 document identified it as the northernmost point of the Pirate Coast—a stretch of land named after the marauding activities of the people living along the coast. At the time, Al Wakrah was a small fishing and pearling village that, according to other official records, harbored between 250 and 300 boats between 1920 and 1925. But you’d be hard-pressed to find evidence of intrepid pearl divers and swooping swashbucklers in today’s Al Wakrah—coming across unassuming sailors is a much better bet. Yet, now, as in the past, life in Al Wakrah revolves around the harbor, which was renovated and reopened to the public in 2017. This is a prime location for observing dhows at close range. Dhows are sailing vessels widely used throughout the Indian Ocean. Variations exist according to their country of origin, but a signature feature of all dhows is that they are made of wooden planks stitched together. Traditionally, dhows weigh between three and five tonnes and require a crew of 12 to 30 sailors. Traditional dhows from Qatar cover the whole tonnage spectrum, tend to be double masted, and use triangular sails. However, most dhows at Al Wakrah Harbour are motorized. Some dhows are equipped for fishing, while others offer cruises to tourists. Regardless of their different duties, all dhows display traditional designs.  Walking around the harbor is free. The harbor is a 25-30-minute drive from Doha, if you have your own car.",sailors fishing boats

The first sculpture is that of an egg being fertilized by a sperm, and the last sculpture is that of an anatomically correct newborn. Between the two is the detailed development of the fetus, including a sculpture showing twins in the womb. This artwork, which is by Damien Hirst, was commissioned by Sheikha Mayassa Al Thani. It was appropriately placed in front of the Sidra Medical and Research Center, a hospital with a focus on women’s and children’s health. Although the statues were originally unveiled in 2013, they remained covered before their official unveiling in 2018. The reason for the double unveiling is that the completion of the building housing Sidra Medical Center was delayed. Officially, the covering was meant to protect the statues from the dust caused by the construction work, but rumors allege that the sculptures were recovered in 2013 to allow their initial backlash to fade. In an interview with Doha News in 2018, Hirst said that The Miraculous Journey is the first sculpture in the Middle East portraying a naked human body, and that it may cause some controversy, which it certainly did. Critics expressed their dissent in the media, arguing that the artwork was insensitive to the local culture. Curiously, most objections came from abroad. But art critic Layla Ibrahim Bacha said the work was not meant to please anyone’s aesthetic sensibility, but should instead spark a debate about the importance of healthcare for women and children. In this respect, the artwork exceeded expectations, as the debate went even further than intended, prompting some to discuss the suitability of using art to provoke public debate.

207,Souq Wakif Blue Road,"Doha, Qatar",This vibrant side road in Doha was painted light blue to reduce heat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/souq-wakif-blue-road,"There’s a blue road running by Souq Waqif known as Abdullah Bin Jassim Street. The unconventional idea to paint the road blue was approved by Ashghal, the Public Works Authority, as a pilot project designed to reduce heat radiating from the asphalt. The exact composition of the paint is not a matter of public knowledge. All that is known is that the paint consists of four coats, resulting in a thick layer of heat-reflecting blue paint, with hollow ceramic microspheres specifically created to combat extremely high temperatures.  Temperatures gauged at ground level have measured around 15 to 20 degrees Celsius lower than the temperature recorded at ground level or along nearby regular, dark asphalt roads. The difference is due to the reduced amount of heat the light-colored surface absorbs and releases during the hottest parts of the day.

208,'East-West/West-East',Qatar,"Four steel monoliths stand in the Qatari desert, in a breathtaking work of large-scale art by Richard Serra.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/east-west-west-east,"Richard Serra is one of those artists that is devoted to bringing art to the larger public. His artworks are usually large in size, and custom-made for the place where they are displayed. In his work, he explores the three-way relationship between the viewer, the artwork, and the location. It was Sheikha Al-Mayassa who suggested that Serra build a sculpture in the Qatari desert, and in 2014 that idea came to fruition under the name of East-West/West-East. East-West/West-East encapsulates Serra’s artistic approach. It consists of four steel plates aligned along a one-kilometer stretch of the desert in the Brouq Nature Reserve. The plates are over 14 meters (46 feet) tall, but their exact heights differ in order to account for the changes in the terrain level and still reach alignment. The plates are aligned along the East-West axis and they are flanked by two equidistant escarpments that separate two gypsum plateaus. The four plates are made of steel from Germany specifically chosen because of the different shades and hues it acquires while rusting. This is a choice that Serra made for other installations, but East-West/West-East is rusting at a much faster pace than others due to the harsh desert climate. Though it is a relatively new installation, it has already acquired a rich red hue. In the summer, the plates trap so much heat that it is sometimes impossible to touch them without burning oneself. The appearance of oversized rectangular structures in a desolate landscape recalls the monolith immortalized by Stanley Kubric’s opening scenes of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  There is no paved road leading to East-West/West-East.  The monument can be reached by following one of several desert tracks.  You will need a car with some clearance, but there is no need for a 4x4.",desert art art outside deserts sculptures
209,Orry the Oryx Statue,"Doha, Qatar",This seemingly random 30-foot statue of an oryx in Qatar's capital was a mascot for the 2006 Asian Games.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/orry-the-oryx-statue,"Standing approximately 30 feet tall, in the center of Doha, is a seemingly meaningless statue of a standing antelope-like animal holding a torch and dressed in gym shorts, a t-shirt, and tennis shoes. Despite its apparent randomness, it was intentionally created over a decade ago for the whole world to see. Every four years, alternating with the Olympics, are the “Asian Games”, a 45-country multi-sport competition between all Asian countries (excluding Russia). In 2006, the Asian Games moved to the Arabian Peninsula for the first time, and Doha, the chosen city, had to come up with a regionally relevant mascot. They chose the Arabian Oryx, a species of antelope that was extinct in the wild from 1972 to 1982, and since being reintroduced has remained a species vulnerable to extinction. They nicknamed the mascot “Orry the Oryx”. The mascot’s image was spread widely as advertisement for the Asian Games — TV commercials, a Facebook Page, and even a giant statue. This multi-story statue was placed on the Doha Corniche, the seaside promenade in downtown Doha, Qatar’s largest city. The oryx still stands today, both on the Doha Corniche and in certain parts of the wild. And it’s not alone — just a few hundred feet further down on the Corniche is the Pearl Monument, a giant clam statue to honor Doha’s pearl industry.",sports statues animals

The lagoon’s name originates from the Arabic term karaa, which means “rainwater” or “freshwater.” Al Karaana was named after a local well that yielded exceptionally clean water. It is a great place to see a wide variety of birds, fishes, and flora as well as an amazing spot for photography. Another great thing about this place is that unlike most hidden gems outside of Doha which require a 4x4 to visit, Al Karaana can be reached in a sedan, although some off-roading is involved.

During peak falconry season, September to January, Souq Waqif Falcon Hospital treats up to 150 birds a day. First opened in 2008, Souq Waqif Falcon Hospital is a state-of-the-art facility with equipment to deal with issues from a chipped talon to a broken wing. Technicians can even replace missing feathers, and keep drawers full of different specimens so they can match the pattern of a particular bird. The three-story hospital is subsidized by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Falconry is a popular sport and hobby in Qatar, and the practice dates back thousands of years. It was introduced to the Arabian peninsula by nomadic Bedouin tribes, who trained birds of prey to aid in hunting. Few people rely on falcons to feed their families these days, but birds are kept as companions and trained in the sport of falconry. The falcon hospital is located near the Falcon Souq, where specialist shops sell birds for prices that can reach tens of thousands of dollars. (These birds are such a big deal that in the United Arab Emirates, falcons are issued their own special passports.)

212,Mada'in Salih,"Hegra, Saudi Arabia",The remote tomb known as Qasr al-Farid is carved right into a giant Saudi Arabian boulder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lonely-castle-saudi-arabia,"Among the dozens of ruins located in the archeological playground of Mada’in Saleh, one literally stands alone. Carved into a massive boulder, Qasr al-Farid, or “The Lonely Castle,” is a stunning ancient structure that rivals the majesty of any carved architecture in the world. Created around the 1st century CE, the tall facade was never actually finished. The description of the site as a “castle” is misleading, as the grand carving is actually a tomb that was built as part of the ancient Nabatean site of Hegra. The Nabateans had a unique construction technique that saw their tombs being chiseled right out of the rock from the top down. Such is the case with Qasr al-Farid, although the monument appears to never have been completed, so the craftsmanship and precision of work slowly deteriorate closer to the base of the structure. Generally speaking, this may be seen as a strike against the site in terms of its beauty or its archeological importance, but the tapering finish on the facade has actually turned out to be a boon. The incomplete portion of the tomb is a terrific window into the steps taken by the ancient carvers before the rougher work was polished away. Archeological importance aside, The Lonely Castle stands out as a starkly unforgettable wonder in a region that is crowded with them.

213,Mada'in Saleh,"Al Ula, Saudi Arabia",Ancient Nabatean caravan city filled with desert tombs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mada-in-saleh,"The Nabateans were an ancient people of the Middle East who became wealthy through the caravan trade between Southern Arabia and the Jordan Valley. They are most famous for the magnificence of their capital city, Petra (in modern Jordan), which has rightly been chosen one of the Modern Seven Wonders of the World. Mada’in Saleh, roughly halfway between Petra and Mecca, was the Nabatean’s second city. Also known as al-Hijr and Hegra, Mada’in Saleh fell into disuse after the Roman occupation of the Nabatean Kingdom in 106 AD, since the Romans preferred the ports along the Red Sea rather than the overland caravan routes. Although Mada’in Saleh lacks the magnificent grandeur of Petra, it is nevertheless one of the most enigmatic archaeological sites on the Arabian Peninsula. Several large boulders rise abruptly out of the flat desert landscape. As in Petra, most of the structures that can be seen today were for funerary purpose only, including a total of 131 tombs that have been cut into the surrounding rocks. Aside from the tombs, the site also features a cult place, called Diwan, and the Siq, a narrow passageway between two large boulders, dotted with a couple of small altars, marking the pre-Islamic nature of the Nabateans. The active excavation site at the center of Mada’in Saleh also contains some rather unassuming adobe houses, which were once the living quarters of the city.

Once a bustling civilization, these 800 tightly packed mud-brick and stone houses — parts of which are more than 2,000 years old — are now abandoned ruins, decaying in the hot desert sun. The walled city of Al ‘Ula was founded in 6th century BC, an oasis in the desert valley, with fertile soil and plenty of water. It was located along “Incense Road,” the network of routes that facilitated the trading of spices, silk and other luxury items through Arabia, Egypt and India. Al ‘Ula stands on the site of the biblical city of Dedan, but was founded with the ancient North Arabian Kingdom of Lihyan, which ruled from the 5th to 2nd century BC. Though most of the original houses in the old town were rebuilt over the centuries, there are many remnants of traditional Arab architecture among the ruins. Some of the old stones used in the building foundations came from ancient ruins, and still have Lihyanite markings on them. The abandoned city has religious significance as well; Muslims believe Muhammad passed through Al ‘Ula — located about 380 kilometers (240 miles) north of the holy city of Medina — in 630 AD on his way to the Battle of Tabuk between the Arabs and the Byzantines. After being reconstructed in the 13th century, old town Al ‘Ula was inhabited until modern times. When the cramped space and poor infrastructure didn’t meet 20th century standards, it was abandoned by residents for a new town nearby, called Al- ‘Ula. The last family left town in 1983, and the last mosque service was held two years later, in 1985. The tourists that now visit Al ‘Ula often find themselves completely alone in the ruins of an ancient civilization, enjoying the silence and imagining what life in the winding streets would be like when there were hundreds of people living in the mud-brick huts. Unfortunately, visitors may not have this pleasure for long. As time goes by, the mud huts of Al ‘Ula are becoming increasingly decayed. Despite the Saudi government’s efforts to restore the old city, perhaps before long Al ‘Ula will be turned to dust.",middle east spices islam ancient ruins

Even from a distance the place can easily be located by the white glow it surrounds. The houses of the village itself are not made of marble, but of flake stones and slate. Instead, the village got the moniker “Marble Village,” for the rocky outcrop it is built upon. The outcrop is a gleaming rocky hill of white marble, which stands in sharp contrast to the grayish dark slates that the houses are constructed. The gray mountains that tower behind the outcrop and the green fields in the foreground add to shining marble that forms a foundation for the village. Even the road that leads to the village is impressive, and several historical stone and slate towers dot the way. Al-Bahah Province is known as the region of 1001 towers, once built to protect villages, roads and plantations from rivalling tribes. Today, these towers are abandoned, and many of them are partially or completely in ruins. The 400-year old village was also abandoned around 30 to 40 years ago, which makes the village even more atmospheric. Visitors should be extremely careful when wandering around as many of the structures are dilapidated and in a serious state of decay.

When you stand atop them and look toward the horizon, you have a prime view of the sky as it seems to melt into the barren earth. The Edge of the World (Jebel Fihrayn) is an unexpected and dramatic geological wonder in the rocky desert northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The site earned its nickname because from atop the escarpment, you have an uninterrupted view of the horizon. It’s part of the much longer Tuwaiq Escarpment, and drops down 1,000 feet into an ancient ocean bed. While standing on the cliffs, you’ll spot dried rivers weaving across the land, and see camels moving far below. These camels and their herders are following a well-trodden path, as an ancient caravan route once passed within its shadow. There are several hiking trails on and around the cliffs. If you pass through a spot dubbed “the window,” you can even get down to the lower plateau. Keep an eye out for fossils as you’re exploring, and be careful, as the gravel is loose and the rocks are sharp.  You will need a SUV with clearance to get here, but four-wheel drive is optional. A guide/tour is not needed. You should be familiar with driving on dirt roads that are heavily potholed, as it is easy enough to pop a tire if you drive too fast and hit one of the rocky potholes. The drive takes between an hour and a half to two hours from Riyadh. On The Way Around lists two different approaches. The most popular one is via the Acacia Valley, but it is only open on Fridays and Saturdays. The other approach via the Sadus Dam is open at all times. Roads are rough on both routes, and low-rise vehicles will have trouble. The Google Maps way has no signs or much in terms of physical waypoints, but the GPS is spot on. MAPS.ME also has accurate GPS for the roads. Be sure to stock up on food and water before attempting either road.

Described in Exodus at the Mountain of G-d, Horeb is also known as the Mountain of Yhvh. While, officially, the location of Mount Horeb is unknown, Jewish and Christian scholars have long argued as to its whereabouts since biblical times. Elijah is described as having traveled to the site in 1 Kings 19:8, which would imply that its location was familiar at the time that book was written, but there are no biblical references set at a later time. Still, some have decided that this mountain in Saudi Arabia fits the biblical description, despite the lack of precise Biblical information as to the geographic location of the site. There is an altar at the mountain’s base. There are warning markers around the base that Moses was instructed to make. The rock that gushed water is nearby. The top of the mountain is black because as the Bible says God came down on the mountain with fire. Visitors are welcome near the site, but the entire mountain is covered in a barbed wire fence and armed Saudi guards that keep patrol, so getting too close is out of the question.

It is estimated that the tomb was 120 meters long, three metres wide and six metres high before its condition began to deteriorate decades ago due to the neglect by Wahhabist authorities who believe paying too much attention to a grave site is likely to lead to idolatry. Nonetheless, Eve’s body supposedly ended up in Jeddah, where she might have lived, and was buried here.

The giant crater was long thought to have been created by an ancient meteor strike, but has been found to have appeared thanks to volcanic activity. It is thought that the crater appeared after a massive underground steam explosion that was caused when a magma flow ran into a subterranean source of water. The resulting eruption would have launched a colossal amount of earth into the air, leaving behind the crater that exists today. At 1.2 miles across and over 800 feet deep, it is an impressive pock mark on the planet. While giant craters are interesting and lovely on their own, the Al Wahbah Crater also holds a dazzling white salt flat in its depths. The white phosphate plain forms a pattern of beige psychedelia that makes the spot all the more attractive. In addition to the weird salt deposit, the crater is also notable for the green vegetation that grows on and around its rim. While the desert all around the crater is arid and barren, the crater is home to palm trees and shrubs. In recent years, the Saudi Arabian tourist industry has set their sights on the crater, building roads and markers to the site to make it easier to visit, making it an increasingly popular camping site.

Taking the fortress by surprise, Abdulaziz captured the fort and took control of Riyadh, his ancestral home after having lived in exile in Kuwait. From this fortress, Abdulaziz Al Saud conquered and united the different kingdoms and provinces that make up the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The clay and mud-brick fort was built around 1865 by the prince of Riyadh Abdulrahman ibn Sulaiman ibn Dabaan under the reign of Mohammed ibn Abdullah ibn Rasheed (1289–1315 AH), the ruler of Ha’il to the north, who had wrested control of the city from the rival clan of Al Saud. It was used by King Abdulaziz from 1902 to 1938 until a new palace was constructed. The Saudi government made a series of renovations in the 1980s as part of an effort to restore and maintain artifacts important to Saudi history. Visitors enter the fort from an open plaza and through a palm tree gate that is 12 high by about 9 ft wide. The door features an opening, called al-Khokha, that is just big enough for one person to pass at a time, a defensive measure. Inside, the fort houses a collection of historical artifacts, including guns used in the assault along with a working well. Like with any important building the fort houses a small mosque for its occupants. Visitors are also treated to a video detailing the history of the assault and the founding of the modern kingdom, though this is in Arabic with English subtitles (an English version can be seen at the National Museum of Saudi Arabia complete with a laser light show). The fort is situated near busy streets, surrounded by a bustling market or suq with shops selling everything from clothes, jewelry, gold, tailored suits, souvenirs, and a tasty treat simply called Corn in a Cup (it is buttered salted corn kernels, in a cup and it is delicious). No visit to Masmak is complete without a stroll through this wonderful market.  If you happen to have a visa to Saudi Arabia, you will find out things tend to close during the day (mainly for prayers but it can also be very hot depending on the time of the year) and there are only certain times women can visit. The fort is open from Saturdays to Thursdays from 8 a.m. till 12 noon and again from 4 p.m. till 9 p.m (shops in the market are also open these same times).

This is Al Janadriyah. Started in 1985 and sponsored by the Saudi National Guard, the festival features a variety of activities, sports (including camel racing), dancing (almost unheard of in the kingdom), arts, living history, falconry, traditional arts and crafts, and is a showcase for government institutions and services, both Saudi and international. It is also a chance to see the Saudi people let their hair down, so to speak. Each province of the kingdom is represented with its own pavilion, usually a recreation of local architecture. Visitors stroll through the pavilions looking at local arts and crafts and representatives eager to talk about the history and wonders of their particular region. Food is plentiful as one can eat his or her way across the varied cuisines of the Arabian peninsula or grab a quick shwarma from stand. No visit is complete without taking part in a tea service featuring Saudi “coffee” (cardamom coffee), a sweet hot mint tea, and dates. Also on display are pavilions hosted by various Saudi government agencies, most notably the military. However, each year, there is usually a pavilion hosted by a foreign government, focusing on relations with the Saudi kingdom and investments made there. Janadriyah isn’t all local color and government showcases. Like any fair, it has it’s silly souvenirs and lighted toys demanded by children everywhere and tossed aside when they get home. It is not uncommon (and very strange) to see Saudi women wearing cowboy hats on top of their abayas. If you happen to be in the country around this time, it is worth a visit to this unique and wonderful display of culture and history.

However, archeological evidence shows several structures have existed on this site since the first century AD.  It’s prominence at the highest point in the area gives it a commanding view of the city, but it serves more than one purpose.

The site consists of three structures: a larger building that accommodated up to 25 railway workers, a smaller one that accommodated up to 15 workers, and a double-tank water tower located between these two buildings. About 100 meters to the south of the station are four freight wagons standing on railway tracks and one lying on its side. Although the railway tracks have been removed, the track ballast is still recognizable. About 100 meters to the east of these buildings is a Krauss 0-6-0T steam locomotive lying on its side with five freight wagons attached. The train was pushed over by people that collected railway tracks for scrap metal. The Hejaz Railway was built between 1900 and 1908. It connected Damascus to Medina, and was ostensibly built to serve pilgrims visiting places of worship in Saudi Arabia. It was, in fact, planned that the network would eventually reach the holy city of Mecca, but the construction came to a halt due to the onset of World War I, and the railway never extended beyond Medina. There was, however, a more strategic reason for constructing this railway route, which was to extend the control of the Ottoman Empire over the Arabian Peninsula in general and the holy sites of Islam in particular. Towards the end of the Ottoman Empire, Arab rebels carried out a number of attacks against the railway as a way to destabilize the empire and gain independence. The name of Lawrence of Arabia is linked to these attacks. Trains continued operating along the Hejaz Railway until the demise of the Ottoman Empire in 1920. Though interest in the railway reignited in the 1960s, the trains never became operational again. The Hejaz Railway stations in Tabuk and Medina are well preserved and worth a visit, but the Hadiyah Railway Station has a completely different atmosphere due to the fact that it is lies abandoned in the middle of nowhere.  There is no public transport coming anywhere near this railway station.  It is not necessary to have a 4x4 vehicle, but once one leaves the main road behind, there are no settlements for kilometers, and few (if any) other vehicles can be seen on the road.

225,Lion Tombs of Dadan,"Al Ula, Saudi Arabia",Lions carved into the rockface adorn these two tombs built into the mountains of Dadan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lion-tombs-of-dadan,"The area around Al-Ula is famous for the iconic tombs at Hegra (Mada’in Saleh). These were built by the Nabataeans in the first century. However, archaeological excavations unearthed remains of an even older civilization a stone throw south of Hegra: Dadan (or Dedan), sometimes referred to as Lihyan. The capital city of the Dadan kingdom is also called Dadan, and it was first mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel (27:20) in the Hebrew Bible, written in the 6th century B.C. The city is described as the beating heart of the kingdom and a trading partner of the city of Tyre (in modern-day Lebanon) along the frankincense route linking the Levant to Oman and Yemen, where the best frankincense was and still is produced. Being on a major trading route, Dadan was inevitably exposed to other cultures. Archaeologists found a whole fortified city buried under the sand, and influences from other cultures are apparent in their statues, decoration of their buildings, and tombs. The Dadan tombs were excavated in Jabel Dadan, the mountain rising beside the fortified city. These tombs tend to be smaller and simpler than those of the Nabataeans. Dadan tombs usually consist of square niches hewn into the rock. According to their religion, the souls of the dead would reach heaven more quickly if buried in the mountains, a belief that was also shared around the same time by the Lycians, in modern-day Turkey. Some of these tombs have the name of the departed carved at the base, but most do not have any differentiating marks at all. The exceptions are two tombs about 50 meters (164 feet) above the wadi, to the south of Dadan city. Each of these two tombs is adorned with a stylized lion that is as big as the opening of the tomb. The symbolic association of lions with strength and power indicates that the two people buried here must have been rich and powerful, but there is something peculiar with the fact that only these two tombs bear this emblem—or, in fact, any emblems at all. This distinctiveness led archaeologists to speculate that other factors may be at play. An inscription at the base of these tombs helped to unravel the mystery. The inscription indicates that the two people buried here are Minaeans, people from Yemen. This detail suggests the possibility that a small contingent of Minaean traders lived in Dadan and two of them intended to mark their identity by adorning their tombs according to their traditions.

226,Pigeon Tower,"Ad Dilam, Saudi Arabia",A historic structure that once housed pigeons used by farmers to help fertilize farmland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pigeons-tower,"Pigeon towers of varying sizes and shapes can be found throughout the Middle East, and their use dates back to the Middle Ages, and probably, even further. Far from being a fruitless pastime, pigeon towers provide farmers with much-prized fertilizer – or at least, they did. They were constructed with logs and mud, and their eye-catching architectural designs attract visitors. The design of pigeon towers varies from region to region, each variation representing ingenious adaptations to the geographical and meteorological circumstances of the place. The set of 14 pigeon towers in Ad Dilam is characterized by very few openings through which birds can enter and exit the towers. However, the inside is entirely covered with niches where pigeons can roost, breed, and find shelter during sandstorms or the hottest months of the year. Wooden beams criss-cross the otherwise empty space between the walls, increasing the strength of the structure, while also providing additional surface where birds can perch. The area surrounding the Pigeon Tower in Ad Dilam is arid and inhospitable. If it weren’t for reservoirs of water found deep underground it would be uninhabitable for humans. Water alone, however, does not suffice for farming because of the scarcity of nutrients in the soil. For farmers trying to eke a living out of this land, the phosphorus and nitrogen found in pigeon guano must have been a godsend. Yet, surprisingly, these towers are all but empty (as of 2022). A quick wander around the towers can unravel part of the mystery. Cartridges are scattered throughout the ground around the towers. Whether this is evidence of defensible mass culling or just a vicious pastime remains unclear. What is clear is that these beautiful towers are lamentably underused.",birds history & culture architecture
227,The Judah Thumb,"Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia","In the middle of a barren desert, a massive, solitary rocky thumb juts out.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/judah-thumb,"Between Riyadh and Dammam in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia lies the city of Judah and its massive thumb. It is also often called the “Devil’s Thumb”—rumor has it that the nickname came from a local Boy Scout troop. In a rather desolated area, this rock truly sticks out like a sore thumb. This towering rock formation stands in the An Nafud region of the Arabian Desert, a vast expanse with an area of 25,000 square miles (65,000 square km).  The pathway there is not paved. While it is composed of compressed rock and sand, a vehicle with plenty of clearance is strongly recommended. Camping is allowed and the area is known for its starlit nights. There are no facilities at the site; however, there are stores nearby in Judah. While it is difficult for this area to get crowded, most people visit during the day with early mornings and late afternoons tending to be more solitary.",rock formations deserts geology
228,Wadi-e Jinn,Saudi Arabia,"A phenomenon that appears to make gravity work in reverse has been attributed to jinn, supernatural spirits from Arabian folklore.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wadi-e-jinn,"Wadi-e Jinn attracts a fair share of curious visitors from the surrounding area due to the fact that cars seem to be moving uphill when put in neutral. This is a phenomenon that can be observed in hundreds of places around the world, and it is commonly known as a “gravity hill.” Magnetism has sometimes been invoked as an explanation, and so have supernatural causes. However, the most credible explanation is that it is an optical illusion created by the landscape, which is slightly tilted and gives the impression that a road gently sloping downhill is actually sloping uphill. As a result, vehicles seem to be moving uphill as if attracted by a tractor beam. Wadi-e Jinn is named after jinn, supernatural spirits that populate Arabian folklore. Jinn can be either well- or ill-intentioned, and they can be called upon as an explanation for unusual or mysterious phenomena. Since the naming of the wadi predates the arrival of automobiles and paved roads, it stands to reason that local people have been aware of something unusual about this place. This should not be surprising, as the phenomenon of gravity hills can also be observed with running water. There is also a wealth of anecdotes claiming that voices can be heard at night, urging humans to leave the wadi to the jinn. Wadi-e Jinn extends for 15 kilometers (9 miles), most of which is paved with picnic grounds set up along the road, and an unfortunate amount of litter strewn everywhere. The upper part of the wadi, however, still retains the raw charm of a classic wadi. Unlike other wadis, though, the combination of rounded boulders balancing at improbable angles and the slanted fault lines of rocks can have a disorienting effect. In recent years, reports that vehicles have reached a speed of 120 kilometers per hour (75 mph) as a result of a magnetic pull have appeared in local newspapers. These claims are not supported by evidence, but they do fuel the myth that supernatural forces must be at play.",gravity hill folklore deserts
229,Jabal Ikmah,"Al Ula, Saudi Arabia","The rocks around this mountain are filled with so many carvings that the area became known as the ""open library.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jabal-ikmah,"The rock formations around Jabal Ikmah, a mountain five kilometers north of Al-Ula, are stunning. But what makes Jabal Ikmah truly exceptional are the thousands of ancient inscriptions carved into the cliffs along one of its crevasses. The high concentration of engravings at Jabal Ikmah made it earn the title of “Open Library,” but the reason why so many ancient people decided to leave their mark here is unknown.  What is known is that the nearby Dadan city used to be a major regional hub in the 6th century B.C., attracting traders and scholars from far and wide. Reliable estimates date the oldest inscriptions at Jabal Ikmah to 644 B.C. Languages represented in these inscriptions include Aramaic, Dadanitic, Safaitic, Thamudic, Minaic, and Nabataean, all languages that predated and eventually influenced Arabic. All these scripts and languages have been deciphered, which increases the historical significance of this place. This mountain truly bears witness to the tumultuous history that unfolded in this region through the millennia. The topics represented in the inscriptions range from names of people with little or no additional information, to detailed descriptions of religious rituals, commercial transactions, and transcriptions of local laws. Several geographical names are also mentioned, including Badr, Tha’al, and Mahja, which testifies to the crucial role that the city of Dadan played along this trading route. In addition to writings, there are also drawings of human figures, animals, and everyday tools. Stylized representations of humans are generally drawn in the act of performing a task, such as hunting, herding, or farming. As for animals, in addition to the predictable depictions of camels, there are also deer, sheep, goats, and a conspicuously muscular bull. Finally, several tools can be recognized, including farming and hunting implements, and musical instruments. The presence of rock inscriptions is not an anomaly in this area, and they can also be found at Mabrak al-Naqah, Naqsh Zuhayr, and Umm Daraj, but the concentration, quality, and variety found at Jabal Ikmah is unique.  As of 2022, visits to Jabal Ikmah can only be organised through the information center in Al-Ula Winter Park.",rock formations mountains archaeology history & culture
230,Al Yanfa,"Tamniah, Saudi Arabia",A network of tunnels runs underneath the buildings of this ancient village.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-yanfa,"The village of Al Yanfa is built on the slopes of the Sahn Tamniah, a mountain range in the ’Asir Region in southwest Saudi Arabia. ’Asir can literally be translated as “difficult”, an aptly descriptive moniker referring to the steep slopes of the mountains that cover the region. Realizing how impractical it was to navigate the steep alleyways of Al Yanfa, the villagers decided to deploy architectural ingenuity to solve the problem. A complex system of warrens was excavated underneath the buildings. These warrens intersect and branch off in different directions, leading eventually to the furthermost buildings of the cluster. Each building can access directly these warrens through one or more doors, which are usually small and tastefully decorated. Light is brought to the darkest sections of this maze by means of lanterns that hang from one of the reinforcing wooden beams. The warrens are supported by wooden beams and poles, but their walls showcase masterful stone masonry construction. These stone foundations support the upper floors of the buildings, which are made of clay and silt. Each layer of silt and clay is capped with protruding stone slabs neatly arranged in parallel horizontal rows. The slabs protect the walls from rain and, as a result, slow down erosion of the silt and clay. In addition to solving the problem of navigating steep alleyways, the network of warrens brought other benefits to the villagers of Al Yanfa. The crisscrossing tunnels under the buildings facilitate a constant circulation of air, which provides some solace during the hottest months of the year. This feature enhances the tried-and-true choice of building houses attached to one another to reduce direct exposure to the elements. In a similar vein, these warrens provide shelter during rainfalls and sandstorms, which are quite common in this region. It is important to point out that these are not ancient ruins—people still live in the buildings of Al Yanfa. Although some buildings are in disrepair, many others are well kept, with different degrees of work done, including structural reinforcement, upward extension of the building, retrofitting, and renovation of the outer walls.",villages subterranean tunnels mountains
231,Jabal al Qahar,"Al Reeth, Saudi Arabia","Climbing the ""mountain of frustration"" is no easy feat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jabal-qahar-struggle-mountin,"Roughly translated as “struggle mountain” or “mountain of frustration,” Jabal al Qahar is a remote plateau in the Asir mountains of Saudi Arabia. It reaches some 2,000 meters above sea level, and until a new road was completed in recent years, this area was only accessible by a single, treacherous track. The isolation combined with the fantastical landscape has led to many stories of djinn (A.K.A. genies) in the area. One such story explains the red handprints found on some of the canyon walls. It’s said that the local village was blessed with a she-camel that gave never-ending milk. One day a man took milk but neglected to cover the camel with its shaw to keep it warm. The next day when he returned the camel gave only blood from its utter and the man slapped his blood-covered hands on the walls in anguish. The area has truly amazing natural features including rock arches, cliff dwellings, 300-meter shear cliffs, and loads of paths to explore by 4x4, mountain bike, or on foot  Anyone can make it here but it does require finesse. Drive to the village of Al Reeth and turn north. a nicely paved road takes you up the mountain. This road abruptly turns to gravel. Turn traction control off and continue up. On the steeper bits keep your speed up to get you to the top. Be careful of sharp rocks and recent rock falls on the roads. As always driving in the KSA is a full-contact sport.

232,Mawan Hidden Canyon,"Khubay, Saudi Arabia",It's believed human settlements from the Palaeolithic Age were established not far from this canyon.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mawan-hidden-canyon,"Mawan Hidden Canyon is located 62 miles (100 kilometers) south of Riyadh. The adjective “hidden” is quite accurate, as you can be a few meters away and still miss the canyon. The surrounding terrain mainly consists of sandstone, sand, and gravel, and the gentle inclines are home to xerophytic shrubs. There is nothing exceptional about this landscape formation, as it is common in Saudi Arabia. What is exceptional, however, is the chasm of this landscape known as the Mawan Hidden Canyon. Mawan Hidden Canyon is approximately less than a mile long, and it reaches a depth of more than six meters. Its width varies from four to eight meters, and it splits into two branches. Along the walls of the canyon, the fascinating interplay of layers of sandstone and limestone is clearly visible, and it forms steps and landings that facilitate the descent to the bottom of the chasm. Footprints left in the slippery layer of mud at the bottom display the presence of canines in the area, possibly desert foxes. Water is not always present, but it gathers here after the odd rainfall, and the shade provided by the canyon ensures that the water evaporates at a lower rate than elsewhere in the area. Nowadays, there are no human settlements nearby, but given the harsh environment, this site must have been of extreme importance in the past. This assumption is corroborated by the remains of human settlements from the Palaeolithic Age unearthed a short distance from the canyon. The mention of this location in writings from the 6th century further attests to its enduring importance.  Coming from Riyadh, exit the highway at Mawan and follow the unnamed road for 2.7km. Follow the dirt track branching off on the left for a few hundred meters. When the dirt track comes to an end, get out of the car and you will be able to discern a rapture in the terrain on your left. This is the Mawan Hidden Canyon.",canyons rock formations natural wonders
233,Al Shinanah Historical Tower,"Ar Rass, Saudi Arabia",This tower has survived the times despite being composed of mud and camel hair.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-shinanah-historical-tower,"About 217 miles (350 kilometers) northwest of Riyadh, Ar Rass is the largest urban center in Al-Qassim Province by size and third-largest by population. Ar Rass (الرس) translates to “old well,” and refers to the source of water that made it possible for people to settle in this area. It also made the area one of the most important trades and pilgrimage routes. At first sight, Ar Rass is nothing more than a cluster of modern buildings surrounded by the desert, but its history dates back to settlements like this and the Al Shinanah Tower. Located on the southwestern edge of town, Al Shinanah Tower has a truncated conical shape measuring 88.5 feet in height, 20 feet in diameter at the base, and five feet at the top. Its interior is divided into eight floors, which can be accessed through a low, narrow door at the base. There are three windows on different floors. Constructed in 1699 using mud and camel hair, Al Shinanah Tower is an outstanding example of Qassim architecture. It was built as a watchtower, which explains why it is located on a slightly elevated plain. The tower played a role in numerous intertribal skirmishes, but also in battles between Ottomans and Arabs. The most recent use of the tower as a military outpost dates back to the Battle of Shinanah (1904) hiswhen Rashidi and Saudi forces clashed in the Qassim Province. It is, therefore, quite surprising that this structure survived to this day, especially considering its slender shape.  Al Shinanah Tower is now fenced in, but the gates are open for most of the day. Within the perimeter of the compound are also a mosque, an administration office, and a semi-permanent tent where the custodian can be found.",history & culture architecture
234,Rijal Alma,"Rijal Alma, Saudi Arabia",A 900-year-old village located in the highland of the Asir region that features historic architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rijal-alma,"This village was an important settlement for pilgrims from Yemen doing the haj, as they would travel through this mountainous area to reach their destination. With the arrival of modern means of transport, the village lost its strategic importance but managed to retain its charm. One of the most noticeable characteristics is the height of the stone buildings in Rijal Alma. Constructing a five- or six-floor stone building required technical expertise radically different from that which is used in simpler one, or two-floor buildings. The latter can be erected using rudimentary pillars to sustain the whole structure, but an increase in height calls for main walls made of stone and clay to fortify the building. More than 60 of these multi-floor buildings can be found in Rijal Alma—the tallest consists of eight floors. Some have been perfectly restored, while others, mainly in the northern section of the village, remain in a dire state of disrepair. Another striking characteristic of these buildings is the use of geometric and floral patterns for decorating internal and external walls, which is meant to call to mind the perfection inherent to religious depictions of the Garden of Eden. This architectural trait can be observed throughout the Asir region, but Rijal Alma brings a level of sophistication that is unique. One aspect of this art that is worth mentioning is that its development and preservation are largely attributed to women. The first two floors of these buildings were usually dedicated to livestock and storage, while people usually occupied the upper floors. This arrangement increased the defensive capability of the house. Considering that raiding and tribal animosity were relatively common, it would have been hard for attackers to reach the upper floors of a stone house, especially compared with one, or two-floor buildings common in other parts of Saudi Arabia. A museum has been opened in the center of the village that showcases local cultural artifacts.",buildings history & culture architecture

236,Salma Palace,"Al-Badie Al-Shamali, Saudi Arabia",Parts of this palace are upheld by merely palm stems or reeds supported by palm tree beams.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salma-palace,"Dating back to the 10th century CE, Salma Palace was built under the order of Prince Hammad Al-Jumaili to defend his territory from his neighbor and arch-enemy Sharif Hassan bin Abi Nami. An Arab historian by the name of Makki recounts that Sharif Hassan bin Abi Nami sent a 50,000-strong army to conquer territories belonging to Prince Hammad Al-Jumaili, who found shelter inside the fortified walls of Salma Palace. According to Makki’s account, a lengthy siege ensued, but the invaders eventually retreated after 40 days of unfruitful attacks. Upon returning to Sharif Hassan bin Abi Nami, the army spokesman uttered the enigmatic phrase, “We found Salma below it in the water and above it in the sky,” to indicate that they did not manage to overcome the moat and high walls protecting Salma Palace. The etymology of Salma Palace is a matter of speculation, but the most likely explanation is that members of the Al-Jamil Al-Hilal tribe were locally known as Salma’s brothers, and the palace was simply named after this moniker. All the original inner and outer walls of the palace are made of mud, and most are still standing. The walls are approximately 10 meters high and a remarkable three to four meters thick at ground level, which leaves no doubt as to the defensive purpose of this building. The hexagonal shape of the outer walls is somewhat unusual for the region and it probably served a specific military purpose, but there are no documents elucidating this. At each of the five corners, a square-based watchtower is still standing, all equipped with triangular windows. A ditch along the perimeter of the outer walls is still visible today, a clear sign that a moat was there. Triangular niches are an architectural feature that is ubiquitous on the inner walls of the palace, but also visible from the outside on the watchtowers. Some of these niches are strategically placed to draw silhouettes of bigger triangles, while others are aligned horizontally and placed in the upper part of an inner wall to form a frieze. The ceiling consists of palm stems or reeds supported by palm tree beams, in accordance with the traditional architecture of the region. Given the perishable nature of the building materials, parts of the Salma Palace are inaccessible. The presence in some rooms of rudimentary electrical outlets suggests that the palace was inhabited until relatively recently. All the structures inside the palace have been abandoned, including a couple of recently renovated buildings, but some rooms are still used as animal shelters.  Salma Palace is located in the municipality of Al-Badie Al-Shamali, at the intersection of two rural roads that can easily be accessed by car.",fortresses history & culture
237,Wadi al-Dawasir,"Wadi ad-Dawasir, Saudi Arabia",These desert alfalfa farms redefine the meaning of crop circles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wadi-al-dawasir,"Before exploring a place for which limited information is available, you may look at satellite images of the area. If you know how to interpret the patterns, shapes, and textures in these images, they can be treasure troves of information. A prime example of this is Saudi Arabia’s Wadi al-Dawasir, where satellite images show a heavy concentration of green circles running along a large north-south corridor. While the term “crop circle” usually refers to circles created by flattening a crop in a field, Wadi al-Dawasir’s crop circles are quite literally, circles made of crops. Most are alfalfa plantations, with a negligible number producing either wheat or other vegetables.  Each measures just under a kilometer in diameter and although they are all green, their shades and hues vary according to the type, thickness, and health of the crop. These round fields are the result of center pivot irrigation: A well at the center of each circle reaches down to aquifers at depths of 100-200 meters (300-650 feet). Water from the aquifer is pumped up and mixed with fertilizer, which is distributed via rotating sprinklers. This form of irrigation is quite widespread, but in Wadi al-Dawasir it has created a vast expanse of closely arranged crop circles that stand in stark contrast to the desert background—nothing grows beyond the irrigation system’s reach. In fact, Wadi al-Dawasir lies on the edge of Rub’ al Khali, also known as the Empty Quarter, 650,000 square kilometers (250,000 square miles) of inhospitable desert. Alfalfa is a good source of vitamins and minerals, and most grown in Wadi al-Dawasir is used to feed livestock throughout Saudi Arabia. In an attempt to reduce the import of alfalfa, Saudi Arabia incentivized farmers to produce this crop. In the short and medium term, this strategy is paying off, but long-term sustainability may be more problematic. Even though Wadi al-Dawasir receives much more rainfall than the Empty Quarter does, it still receives less than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain a year, much less than what is needed to replenish the underground reservoir of water. This means that the aquifers on which local agriculture relies are slowly but surely running dry. A study conducted by UN-ESCWA and BGR shows that the level of water in these aquifers has been decreasing by approximately six meters a year since the 1980s. There is still a substantial amount of water left, but if extraction continues at this pace, water will run out within the next few decades.  The most spectacular views of the crop circles of Wadi al-Dawasir can be enjoyed from a high vintage point, which is inexistent in the area. The use of drones is not advised, as strict laws regulate the use of these devices in Saudi Arabia. The next best option is to catch a flight to or from Wadi al-Dawasir (WAE), or hire a private aircraft.",crop circles agriculture deserts farms water
