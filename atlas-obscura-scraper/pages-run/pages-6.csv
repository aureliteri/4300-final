0,Ta Prohm,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",A battle between nature and architecture in the Cambodian jungle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ta-prohm,"Had Ta Prohm been diligently maintained from its construction in 1186 to the present day, it would be just a footnote to the larger Angkor Wat temple. But while Ta Prohm lay forgotten and neglected by men, the Cambodian jungle wasted no time in devouring it. Silk-cotton and strangler fig trees took root in the loosened stones of the temple, which was built entirely without mortar. Their roots wound through the structure, creating an astonishing merger of nature and architecture. Built at the height of the Khmer Empire by Jayavarman VII as a Buddhist monastery and center of learning, Ta Prohm (known as Rajavihara back then) has a traditional Khmer structure consisting of a series of gradually smaller enclosures, the largest of which is about 1000 by 650 meters. The sanctuary is centered around the huge, elevated stone face of Prajnaparamita, the personification of wisdom, whose features were modeled after those of the king’s mother. When Angkor was rediscovered in the early 20th century by French archaeologists, all of the temples had become overgrown–but none so spectacularly as Ta Prohm. Nevertheless, as they excavated and restored the other temples, the archaeologists had to make sure that the giant tree roots enveloping Ta Prohm would not further deteriorate the structure or make it dangerous to visit. Though Ta Prohm may look like nature unfettered, the appearance of neglect is in fact fastidiously maintained. Ta Prohm’s popularity has soared in recent years along with the rest of the Angkor complex, but especially because of its appearance in the movie Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. Be sure to check out the controversial Dinosaur of Ta Prohm–a corner of the Ta Prohm temple with a strange story of its own. Another contributor to the rising popularity of Ta Prohm was the inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1992.  Flights into Siem Reap Airport are a short jump from Phnom Penh or Bangkok. The best months to visit the temple complex with smaller crowds is the wet season from May to October.",long now locations trees ancient plants ruins
1,Bokor Hill Station,"Kampot Province, Cambodia",A former French military respite turned jungle tourism hotspot.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bokor-hill-station,"One of the first things anyone notices during a visit to Cambodia, is the unbearable heat. Sweltering and oppressive temperatures and humidity beat down on travelers wading through the dense tropical jungles of the Southern region. Incidentally, when a larger and more aggressive group of travelers, the French military, made their way through the country, they also found the weather brutal and unforgiving. As the unfamiliar temperatures began killing off French troops, the occupying European power needed to create artificial respite. Their answer to the tropical problem was Bokor Hill Station, a small resort town for French soldiers in the region. Construction finished in the early 1920s, and the result was jungle chic. Instead of building a small outpost to keep soldiers cool and dry, the French opted for opulence, and a small elegant city was born. Bokor Hill was built with the basic amenities of a post office and church. It was also featured the over-the-top Bokor Hill Hotel and Casino, which stands as a monument to French occupation in Cambodia. When civil war broke out in the 1940s, the French headed back to Paris, leaving the station abandoned and open for use by various military regimes including the Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge. Continuous war throughout the 20th century left the station gutted and eerily decaying in the center of Phnum Bokor National Park. Only one completely ruined road leading to the relic still exists, and is a bumpy ride up more than 3,500 feet to the station. Recently, a private investment group has outlined a plan to rebuild the road and restore the area, creating a larger Bokor Hill city complete with a casino and golf course, making Bokor once again a stop for invading foreigners in the southern jungles of Cambodia. The project is now well under way, as can be seen in some of the photos. The red lichen on the walls has been covered with a layer of thin concrete making the building look newer, even at the cost of the old charm. The casino has been built, though the locals consider it an eyesore. Behind the temple is Wat Sampov Pram, Temple of the Five Ships, where rock formations look a great deal like sailing ships when the fog the normally enshrouds the mountain is clear enough to let you see them and the spectacular view of the valley below. Farther down the road, but still on the mountaintop, is Popkvil, Waterfall in the Clouds. it is a popular destination and worth the short ride from the old casino. Between the two, along a back road, is an area called 500 rice fields; a natural area that looks a lot like the Cambodian countryside in miniature. Across the street and through the guard station is an area teaming with rare carnivorous plants; nepenthes or pitcher plants. This area is perfect for their growth and hundreds can be found along the road. They have garnered a lot of attention in recent years because the young plants can look a great deal like something you might buy in an adult toy store.  Some of these plants can be found in the 500 fields area, but if you are a photographer, it is worth it to pay the few bucks to get into the area where the bigger plants can be found. Update December 2018: The reconstruction is complete and it is no longer derelict.  Around 40 km driving from Kampot.",ghost towns military history abandoned military ruins
2,Kbal Spean,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",This Cambodian riverbed is covered in ancient Hindu carvings both above and below the waters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kbal-spean,"Tucked away in the jungles of Angkor, Cambodia is a small river that runs over a series of elaborate carvings that have been etched both along the shore line and into the very stone of the riverbed itself. Created some time around the 11th and 12th century, the carvings at in the Kbal Spean River look like something right out of an Indiana Jones production diary. The designs range from fields of low circles that almost look like holy cobble stones to ornate images of Hindu deities carved in relief on the rocks. Not all of the carvings seem to have originated in the same era, having been added to down the millennia, but today, they all look like they are of a piece. The site is also known as the “Valley of a 1000 Lingas.” This common name is in reference to the low carved circles that were once mound-shaped representations of the Hindu god Shiva, called “lingas.” In contrast there are also a number (though not so many) of designs symbolizing the yoni, a symbol for the Hindu goddess Shakti. The site looks not unlike something that would have come out of a Hollywood storyboard, all fearsome gods and cryptic symbols, barely hidden beneath the jungle undergrowth. Whether you are visiting for a sense of adventure, archaeology, or simple history, the Kbal Spean carvings won’t let you down.  31 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Siem Reap.

3,Dinosaur of Ta Prohm,"Siem Reap, Cambodia","Hoax, mistake, or evidence of dinosaurs in human times?",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dinosaur-angkor-wat,"Hordes of tourists descend on Cambodia every year for the sole purpose of visiting the temples at Angkor. This magnificent series of temples, carved out of the jungle in the 12th and 13th centuries by Khmer devaraja, or god-kings, is still the largest group of religious complexes ever created. Yet most visitors miss one of its more intriguing mysteries. At Ta Prohm, near Angkor Wat and built by the epic builder king Jayavarman VII in the late 1100s, a small carving on a crumbling temple wall seems to show a dinosaur - a stegosaurus, to be exact. The hand-sized carving can be found in a quiet corner of the complex, a stone temple engulfed in jungle vegetation where the roots of centuries-old banyan trees snake through broken walls. After parts of Tomb Raider were shot here, the temple got a PR lift and has become one of the site’s top tourist draws. But many of the package tours are still ushered in and out without spotting the enigmatic dinosaur carving. Several different theories have been advanced to explain its presence. Some maintain it’s a recently-carved hoax, while others say that the ancient Khmers could have unearthed a fossil and figured out what kind of creature it belonged to. One theory has it that the image actually shows a cow or rhino with a palm tree in the background - the palm’s fronds being easily mistaken for the fin-like blades running down a stegosaurus’s back. Or maybe the carving is evidence that dinosaurs really did live on until much later than previously thought. (Creationists would certainly like to believe so.) Perhaps here in the humid, ancient jungles of Southeast Asia, where the climate has remained largely unchanged since the dinosaurs’ days, giant reptiles lived on well into the human era - long enough to persist in the Khmer folk memory. If only these walls could talk, we might have a clue.  The carving is located in a corner of a courtyard in the Ta Prohm temple. Look to the left of the central exit.",dinosaurs mystery ruins animals
4,Sambor Prei Kuk,"Prasat Sambour, Cambodia",More than 100 Hindu temples are slowly being swallowed by the forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sambor-prei-kuk,"Gnarled trees wrap around the ruins that speckle this archaeological site. The centuries-old temples, many of which are capped with grass or shrouded with tree roots, are slowly being reclaimed by the forest. Sambor Prei Kuk consists of a fortified wall enclosing 150 Hindu buildings. An engraving on the main temple of this complex refers to King Isanavarman I, and it is accompanied by a date: September 13, 627. Whether or not this is the exact date when the construction of the temple was completed, it still means that Sambor Prei Kuk predates Angkor Wat by several centuries. Sambor Prei Kuk was the capital of the Chenla Empire (600 to 800). The label of “empire” should be qualified, as it stems from accounts by Chinese emissaries, but it probably referred to a cluster of semi-independent chiefdoms co-existing in a peaceful federation. The site is divided into three groups. Group N (North) and S (South) are both from the seventh century and glorify Shiva. Prasat Sambor (the main temple) belongs to Group N. Group C (Central) consists of more recent temples from the ninth century, including Prasat Boram, a temple famed for its lion sculptures. There are some obvious architectural similarities between Sambor Prei Kuk and the temple found on Angkor Wat grounds. The outstanding lintels, pediments, and columns of Sambor Prei Kuk are precursors of the Angkor style. There are, however, some aspects that are distinctive to Sambor Prei Kuk, such as the 10n octagonal towers, which are unique in Southeast Asia. Of the 150 religious buildings, most are in ruins and barely recognizable, but it is a thrill to wander in the forest and trying to locate some of these buildings, which, at times, blend in seamlessly with the vegetation. As in other archaeological sites in Cambodia, the intrinsic value of these temples is only part of their attractiveness. The other part is the interplay of human-made structures and nature that stands simultaneously as a reminder of the reliance of these ancient buildings and the sobering thought that in the long run, nature will always have the upper hand. But though the archaeological site now feels like a tranquil forest escape, it hasn’t always been the peaceful spot it is today. In the 1970s, a contingent of the Khmer Rouge took refuge on the grounds of Sambor Prei Kuk, and, as a result, the United States bombed the site, damaging some temples. You can still see some of the dips in the ground that the bombs created. To make things worse, it seems that the Khmer Rouge also littered the grounds with mines, which weren’t removed until 2008.  Sambor Prei Kuk is an archaeological site about 19 miles (30 kilometers) west of provincial capital Kompong Thom. The site is open daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Caution should be exercised—though these grounds were cleared of all landmines in 2008, it's hard to know with absolute certainty that no mines have been left behind.",temples archaeology ruins
5,Phnom Penh Memorial Stupa,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia","5,000 skulls in memorial to those killed by the Khmer Rouge.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phnom-penh-memorial-stupa,"After the Cambodian Civil War ended, the vicious rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge began. From 1975-1979, they killed 1.7 million people out of a population of 8 million. Many of those murdered were buried in mass graves in what has come to be dubbed the “killing fields.” In Phnom Penh at Choeung Ek, a memorial was erected to remember those who were killed at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. At the site, the remains of an estimated 10,000 people were found. The memorial was then constructed so as not to obscure the facts, but to show the grisly and honest truth. Designed in the style of a Buddhist stupa, the Choeung Ek memorial has glass sides, and is comprised of multiple layers of human skulls. Totaling 5,000 of those executed at the site, the skulls are a harsh reminder of a genocide that took place only 40 years ago. The memorial is particularly disturbing upon closer examination of the skulls, many of which bear marks of the trauma they suffered before their execution. Along with the stupa, Choeung Ek still has a number of pits that were used as mass graves, and some human bones can still be seen in the area. The Cambodian government encourages visitors to see the site, and never forget the atrocities committed during the Khmer Rouge regime.

6,Preah Vihear Temple,"Kantuot, Cambodia",This impressive clifftop temple was once at the center of an international custody dispute.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/preah-vihear-temple,"Sitting majestically atop a perilous cliff among the Dângrêk Mountains, the Preah Vihear Temple is a gem of Cambodian temple architecture, although for a long time, many fought for this jewel to belong in Thailand’s crown. A temple has existed on the site since the 9th century, but the elaborately detailed complex found here today dates back to around the 11th century. It was built by the Suryavarman kings who were replicating the glorious intent of the nearby temples at Angkor. While the temple buildings at Preah Vihear are not as glorious as those at Angkor, they were meant to represent the same holy pinnacle. The whole complex is set up in a long horizontal line along the edge of the cliff, comprised of multiple structures, each impressive in their own right. As the Dângrêk Mountains have borders belonging to both Cambodia and Thailand, the site’s ownership became an issue between the two countries when the temple was rediscovered in the early 20th century. Both sides wanted to own the ancient site and its rich trove of artifacts, and the dispute even went to The Hague. In 1962, the matter was finally settled when the international court decided that the temple belonged to Cambodia, a ruling that stands today.  Although open from the Cambodian side, the Thailand side is often blocked.",territorial dispute borders temples ruins
7,Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau,"Krong Battambang, Cambodia","Limestone caves in the Cambodian countryside, once the site of genocide, now a place of peaceful beauty.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/killing-caves-of-phnom-sampeau,"The Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau (also known as Phnom Sampov) are a place of beauty, turned tragedy, turned beauty once more. The cave are located halfway up a mountain which is dotted with beautiful wats, statues, and lookout points over the village below. Macaque monkeys roam the mountainside, and millions of bats can be seen at dusk. Stairways snake up the mountain and back down again into limestone caves and canyons. One of these caves is the Killing Cave. From 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million Cambodians were killed at the hands of Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge soldiers. These are the bones of doctors, teachers, men, women and children who were killed by the Khmer Rouge at this site. At the top of the cave is the natural skylight which the Khmer Rouge marched people to, lining them up, then bludgeoning them and letting their bodies fall into the darkness below. The site has now been turned into a memorial to those who lost their lives at this site. The descent into the cave is quite beautiful—the rock is covered in green vegetation and low-hanging vines. The cave is quite large inside, and a huge golden Buddha reclines in the center of the room. But at the bottom of the stairway sits a chicken-wire cage full of bones. The atrocities that took place in this beautiful spot suddenly become very present. To the right is another memorial of human remains, these encased in a glass box. Today a mix of mostly Cambodian tourists mills around the cave, and people sing and take pictures. It is a surprisingly jovial atmosphere considering the horror of what took place.

8,Phsar Thmei (Central Market),"Phnom Penh, Cambodia","One of the biggest markets in Asia, under one of the continent's largest domes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phsar-thmei-central-market,"Phsar Thmei, also known as Central Market (the name actually means “New Market”), is the largest market in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, and was once said to be the most expansive in all of Asia. It also has the distinction of sitting under one of the largest domes on the continent. Before the completion of Phsar Thmei in 1937, the area on which the market now stands was occupied by a swamp fed by runoff water during the rainy season. For the French Protectorate of Cambodia, who was in charge of Phnom Penh at the time, having a swamp in the middle of their city was far from ideal. So they drained it and set about building a huge market, designed by Jean Desbois and supervised by French architect Louis Chauchon. At the time of its construction, Phsar Thmei was said to be the largest market in Asia. But despite its grandeur, it nonetheless had a troubled start. Flooding was a problem, perhaps unsurprisingly given its location in a favored gathering point for runoff water. Then came the Franco-Thai war (1940–1941), during which the market was bombed by Thai aircraft, causing extensive damage. It was closed temporarily and rebuilt after the end of World War II. It later fell into an undeniably shabby state, until the French Development Agency completed a $4.2 million renovation in 2011. It remains one of the largest domes in Asia, measuring 148 feet (45 meters) in diameter and 85 feet (26 meters) high. To say that the market is somewhat incongruous with the rest of central Phnom Penh would be an understatement. With its huge yellow dome and four extending “legs,” it looks—from the air at least—as if a Barbarella-esque Art Deco space robot planted itself in the middle of the city. Walk inside, however, and you’ll find yourself in a vast, cool, and always buzzing market under the towering central dome, with more stalls spreading along the four adjoining wings. Despite the often inflated prices, especially for visiting tourists, Phsar Thmei is the best place in the city for browsing. It’s packed full of all kinds of goods, from impressively intricate gold and silverware to souvenirs, antique coins, electronic goods, clothing (imported and traditional Cambodian), flowers, and an impressive array of dubious watches. And when hunger strikes, the market also has a colorful fresh produce section and plenty of food stalls selling classic local dishes. It’s the best place to escape from the heat, as it is naturally cool inside.  Phsar Thmei Market is located at Street 128 (Kampuchea Krom) in Phsar Thmei 1 Commune, Daun Penh District. It's open daily from 6.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. There's a taxi rank near the northwest corner of the market, and a bus stop near the southwest exit.",shopping domes markets architecture
9,Well of Shadows,"Krong Battambang, Cambodia",A gruesome memorial for those lost in this area during the Khmer Rouge genocide.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/well-of-shadows,"The Well of Shadows is a memorial for those lost in this area during the Cambodian genocide at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. At the top, skulls of the dead are encased in a glass box—at the bottom, bas-reliefs depict the horrors that took place in the woods and rice fields surrounding the memorial. The victims commemorated by this memorial were held at a nearby temple which was seized by the Khmer Rouge and turned into a prison. An estimated 10,000 people were killed there, of the estimated 1.5-2 million deaths that occurred between 1975 and 1979. Reliquaries such as this, displaying the skulls and bones of victims that have been found, dot the country. These remains ask us to remember the atrocities committed. The bas-reliefs circling the bottom of the memorial are more unique. They illustrate in detail the particulars of different ways in which men, women, and children were tortured and killed. While the piles of remains show us the sheer numbers, these images bring home the horrors in vivid detail. The inscription on the memorial, with characteristically Cambodian optimism, reads, “The full extent of Cambodia’s tragedy will never be known. The remains of some of the victims of this genocide may never be recovered, nor their murderers identified. But the gentle and forgiving Khmer are energetic and optimistic people and will now walk confidently through the well of shadows to reclaim their ancient culture and restore this beautiful land to become again, the legendary paradise of celestial Apsaras.”  6 kilometres north of Battambang, on the east side of the Sangkar River",genocide relics and reliquaries prisons memorials

But for those wanting a more intimate experience, you can have a local guide lead you up the hidden path to the mouth of the cave. Standing so close to the cloud of flying creatures whooshing out of the cave is an enthralling encounter. The bats won’t hurt you—they’re too busy hunting for bugs to even care about you—but the swarm is so large and furious you can actually feel the temperature rise as they soar overhead. The bat population is so high it can take upwards of 20 minutes for the cave to clear. Once they’re out, it’s amazing to watch the animals streak across the sky. The hordes of flying bats seem to paint the air with fluid black shapes, forming a series of striking images against a sky tinged with the last bits of sunset colors.

11,Bamboo Trains,"Ratanak Mondul, Cambodia",A quick and simple solution to Cambodia's train woes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bamboo-trains,"Cambodia’s rail system was, for years, a cruel joke. It consisted of a single line. Trains seldom ran. When they did run, the warped, gapped, sometimes missing tracks provided a ride that maxed out around 20 miles per hour and could easily double the time of any other form of transportation. Again, that’s if the trains ran. The “Bamboo Trains,” or “noory” have been a source of transportation, commerce, and communication for those living in parts of Cambodia where access to solid roads, buses, and other automobiles was for years underdeveloped or non-existent. Unlike the hulking carriages and engines of the national line, the bamboo trains are a tinier, simpler affair—a masterpiece of necessity engineering. The body of a norry consists of a single queen-size platform, often made of bamboo, which lies on a metal undercarriage. Steel wheels on a pair of axles lie underneath. A belt wraps around the rear axle and is connected to a lawnmower or boat engine mounted on the rear of the platform. The driver yanks a cord to start it up, the engine emits its mosquito-on-steroids whine, and down the tracks it goes. Nearly a dozen passengers, livestock, or produce and other goods (or any combination thereof) can come along for the ride. The bamboo trains connect small villages and provide a means of transport for both people and goods in areas otherwise unserved. As it is a single line of parallel rails, with travelers going in both directions, a little etiquette is called for. When two noory meet on this single line of track, the lighter train stops, empties its load, the drivers and passengers disassemble the entire operation, removing it from the track so the other noory can pass. Then, they reassemble it, re-start the engine, and on their way they go, once again. It all takes about a minute. The bamboo trains were once found outside of numerous provincial towns anywhere railroad tracks had been laid. It was possible to take the bamboo trains from Battambang to Phnom Penh. As of January 2018, a new dedicated track has been built for the Bamboo Railway, due to the existing line being restored and reinstated for passenger trains and freight services later in 2018. The norry outside of Battambang are the last in existence. A ride on the bamboo trains, perhaps with a chicken, some dogs, and fellow Cambodians, is a great way to see some of the backcountry and to get a feel (bring a cushion) for just how bad the train tracks once were.

12,Kep-Sur-Mer,"Krong Kaeb, Cambodia",An abandoned Cambodian resort that mirrored the downfall of the country as it was happening.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kep-sur-mer,"Kep-Sur-Mer, or Kep by the Sea, (typically shortened to “Kep”) was born by royal decree in 1908 and spent its early years as a station climatique, a seaside escape for French colonial bureaucrats and their families, but now the abandoned luxury homes form a seaside ghost town. The relative stability following Cambodia’s peaceful transition to independence from France in 1953 encouraged international investment and the development of a Cambodian elite. During this boom, Kep became the premier seaside resort as the elite built villas along the gold-orange coastline. Known by various monikers such as “Cambodia’s Riviera,” or, “The St. Tropez of Southeast Asia,” Kep even flaunted a casino during its heyday. The villas took on a number of contemporary influences, from French colonial wrought iron to Le Corbusier-inspired modernism to New Khmer assertiveness. Cambodia’s aristocracy, including the charmed “Playboy King” Norodom Sihanouk, turned Kep into a Cambodian version of Gatsby’s West Egg during this period of Cambodia’s “golden age.” And like the glitzy Long Island of the 1920s, Kep-Sur-Mer’s dream couldn’t last. Cambodia’s bourgeois began the abandonment of Kep after the Lon Nol coup in 1970. The modernist villas began to fall into decay and Kep saw fighting during the Khmer Rouge takeover, which finally put a stop to any future growth. Some reports suggest the buildings were specifically targeted for destruction by the Khmer Rouge and stripped of valuables by the occupying Vietnamese army following 1979. Today the villas remain overgrown with flora and some, the ones not squatted by local residents, are structurally intact and worthy of, though not necessarily safe for, exploration. Their state of picturesque decay may not last long, however; increases in tourism to Cambodia have brought characteristic increases in foreign and local investment and development. Kep may yet see another “golden era.”",ghost towns abandoned
13,Wat Phnom,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",The capital of Cambodia is named after the hill on which this ancient temple complex stands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phnom,"Built in 1372, the temple of Wat Phnom stands on the only hill in Phnom Penh, which lent the the Cambodian capital its name. According to legend, the temple was originally built to house four statues of the Buddha found in a tree floating in the nearby river. Back in 1372, or so the story goes, a wealthy widower named Daun Penh came across a fallen koki tree floating in the river near her home. Inside the tree she found four bronze statues of the Buddha. Amazed by this discovery, Penh and her neighbors built a temporary shrine on a piece of raised ground near her house. The locals called the small hill Phnom Penh, or “Penh’s Hill,” in her honor. About 60 years later, King Ponhea Yat, the last king of the Khmer Empire, moved to Phnom Penh. He gave the order to increase the size of the hill, and to build a wooden temple atop it. This was the first rebuilding of Wat Phnom—one of many over the following centuries—and the remains of Ponhea Yat are still housed in a stupa behind the main temple. The main temple was rebuilt in 1434, 1806, 1894, and 1926. Its importance rose and fell over the years, depending on the whims of kings, and extensive renovations were made to fit the ideologies of various rulers, including the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot. New shrines and statues have been added, and the original walls plastered and painted over on numerous occasions. Today, the temple is an amalgam of styles and structures from across its more than 600-year history, including gardens built by the French in the late 19th century and shrines that represent Taoist, Confucian, and Hindu beliefs. The grand main entrance runs up the eastern stairway, its path guarded by lions and naga, the mythical snakes of Hinduism and Buddhism. Inside the temple sits a large bronze Buddha, the walls covered by paintings that tell his story, and murals that recount the Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana. Many more shrines dot the sides and base of the hill, but few are more important than the shrine to Daun Penh, the supposed founder of the wat. The front of her shrine is often crowded with people leaving offerings of food and praying to Daun Penh, and many women come here to pay tribute to the temple’s female founder. Other notable features include a little shrine dedicated to the spirit or genie Preah Chau, which is thought to offer protection from enemies and is especially popular among the Vietnamese community. There’s also the over 200-foot-wide flower clock, originally a gift from France in the 1960s, but replaced in 2000 by a new version given as a gift by China.  Wat Phnom is located north of Road 102, Norodom Boulevard, in the center of Phnom Penh. It's open from 7 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. Entrance is $1, and $2 for the on-site museum. Prepare yourself for a somewhat chaotic scene when you arrive and begin the walk to the top of the hill. Pushy vendors and beggars vie for your attention, but it's easy enough to navigate; just hold on to your wallet. You should also avoid the people selling birds in cages. Often children are the ones doing this. The idea is that you pay to have the bird released, but the birds are typically trained to return to their cages, or they die from the stress of the whole experience. To make things worse, some of the birds are endangered species.",names shrines buddhism temples religion sacred spaces ruins history

From the outside it looks unremarkable: a multi-story former high school with whitewashed walls and grey shutters. However, inside, Tuol Sleng holds a dark history. Under the Khmer Rouge, Tuol Sleng was transformed from a school into Security prison 21 (S-21), a place in which some of the most violent atrocities of the Pol Pot’s regime were perpetrated. Originally named Chao Ponhea Yat High School, the complex includes five buildings in total. Several months after the Khemer Rouge took power in 1975, they implemented measures to convert the high school into a high-security facility. Between 1975 and 1979 it is estimated that over 15,000 people were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng. The prison held between 1,000 and 1,500 occupants along with a large security force. Life within the prison was terrible, and the people imprisoned at Tuol Sleng were treated cruelly. Prisoners were shackled into their cells, forbidden to talk to one another and frequently beaten and tortured by the guards. All prisoners were interrogated during their stay at Tuol Sleng. These interrogations normally included torture: Prisoners were shocked with electricity, burned with irons and water-boarded. In 2010, Cambodia convicted Kang Kek Iew, the chief of Tuol Sleng Prison, for crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and died while still in custody in 2020. Today, the former prison stands as a monument to the brutalities of the Khmer Rouge. It is now a museum dedicated to preserving the memory of those who passed through its gates. Several of the implements that were used to torture the prisoners are also on display along with a “skull map,” a map of Cambodia made entirely from human skulls and bones. Rooms that were once used to torture and abuse are now lined with thousands of photographs of those who were incarcerated there.  Located in the heart of the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh.

16,Yeak Laom,"Krong Ban Lung, Cambodia","Arguing within this idyllic, circular volcanic lake is forbidden.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yeak-laom,"The shores of Yeak Laom Lake form an almost perfect circle. And though the lake has a small circumference, it’s just shy of 160 feet (about 48 meters) deep. Its shape and depth are due to its volcanic origin. It’s believed that 4,000 years ago, a volcanic eruption created a crater that, over time, filled with water. The lake was once surrounded by thick forest on all sides, but today only a thin layer remains, with most of the land having been farmed. The waters of Yeak Laom are crystal clear, and they stand in stark contrast with the bright green in the background—if you visit during or shortly after the rainy season. Exotic birds and butterflies are common sights, and wild pigs may also come around. Although the lake is considered sacred by the local people, swimming or playing in the water is common for both locals and tourists. Wooden docks with steps have been built to facilitate access. In 2018, bureaucratic procedures were started to register Yeak Laom and the land around it as state land to better protect the environment. Other measures to protect the lake forbid people from using detergents, gambling, or having arguments while in the lake. Five villages are located around the lake. A combination of trails and wooden planks encircles the 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometers) of the lake’s shores. Along the way is a small visitor center with information about the lake and handicrafts for sale.  Yeak Laom is located roughly three miles (five kilometers) from the Ratanakiri provincial capital Banlung, which is ideal for a bike ride. This site can also be reached easily by taxis or motorbikes. Ratanakiri was heavily bombed during the Second Indochina War, and unexploded ordnance is occasionally found in the region.

The name Phimeanakas actually translates to “Celestial Palace.” Construction started at the end of the 10th-century during the reign of Rajendravarma II and was completed by Suryavarma I. It went on to become the state temple of Suryavarman I and the focal point of his capital. The structure was also used by King Jayavarman VII as his private temple and was designed in laterite, a type of clay. Atop the pyramid was a tower that rose from a platform. At the center of the platform now sit the ruins of a small cruciform sanctuary. Along the edge of the top platform are covered galleries. These were the first vaulted galleries to be constructed in Angkor. At the corners of each of the tiers are guardian elephant statues. At the base, the structure measures 82 feet (35 meters) long and 91 feet (28 meters) wide. A very steep stairway leads to the top. All four sides are guarded by lion statues. Around 200 years after its construction, the temple was swallowed up by the city temple of Angkor Thom.

19,Cambodia Landmine Museum,"Kampong Thom, Cambodia",This collection of reclaimed landmines acts as both an exhibition of their deadly history and as a shelter for children affected by them.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cambodian-landmine-museum,"Landmines leftover in war-torn countries such as Cambodia cause innumerable injuries and deaths each year, often with little to no government support for clean-up or support of the victims. However, one Cambodian man’s demining efforts have grown into an educational and inspiring center that not only tells the history of the deadly leftovers but also works to care for those most affected by their violence: children. As a former member of the Khmer Rouge, Cambodian-born Aki Ra, was no stranger to landmines, having placed thousands of them himself. However when the Khmer regime fell Ra used his knowledge to help heal the country by working with the UN as a demining specialist. After working with the UN force for only a year Ra returned to his small village community and began disarming mines in his home area using little more than a stick and a multi-tool. Soon word spread of not only his quest, but of the collection of decommissioned ordinance he was amassing. Ra began traveling from village to village either picking up landmines he himself had laid or answering the pleas of communities that had found or detonated their own. While some of the mines were sold for scrap to fund his humanitarian efforts, he personally kept a number of them. As interest in Ra’s collection grew among foreign visitors, the idea for the Cambodian Landmine Museum was born. At first, the museum was simply a tour of his personal collection, but as it grew, in size and popularity the museum was finally established in 1997. Unfortunately, the Cambodian government almost immediately ordered it shut down, so Ra simply moved it to a national park and created a brand new NGO (non-governmental organization) under which the museum could operate. Today the museum has grown to include displays of Ra’s collected landmines as well as exhibits on the wars that left them including sinister-looking mannequins. In addition to the museum displays, Ra began taking in children injured or orphaned by the landmines he was collecting among the villages, giving them a shelter and a future. This side of the museum has even been expanded to include children who simply have emotional or familial problems. Currently there are dozens of children being housed, fed, and educated by the center, which is an impressive feat for a museum that began with clean-up duty.

20,Tonle Srepok,"Lumphat, Cambodia",The river depicted in the antiwar film 'Apocalypse Now' was likely based on this Mekong tributary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tonle-srepok,"Tonle Srepok is a major tributary of the Mekong River that runs between the Vietnamese province of Đắk Lắk, and the Ratanakiri and Stung Treng provinces in Cambodia. Before the development of modern roads, the river was crucially important to Lao, Khmer, and Vietnamese people for trading purposes, and as a supply line during the U.S.-Vietnam War. Tonle Srepok (also called the Srepok or Serepok River) was along a branch of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and was used to supply North Vietnamese forces fighting in South Vietnam with weapons, ammunition, and food. When the U.S. Army discovered this, the whole area was heavily bombed, leaving behind a huge amount of unexploded ordnance that even today maims those unfortunate enough to step on or hit one. Rumors of U.S. Special Forces infiltrating Ratanakiri province abound—as to the veracity of these rumors, opinions vary. As for Apocalypse Now, in a nutshell, Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 film portrays Captain Willard’s journey along a river going from Vietnam to Cambodia on a mission to find and assassinate renegade Colonel Kurtz. It’s unlikely the scenes were actually shot on the Srepok River, as Coppola was forced to film the movie in the Philippines due to security reasons in Cambodia. However, it’s often said that the river in the film was meant to depict the Tonle Srepok, which may well be true. Among all the sizeable rivers running from Vietnam to Cambodia through heavily forested areas, Tonlé Srepok is the most likely to fit the bill. On a side note, in one of the last scenes of the movie, a water buffalo is sacrificed in a ritual. Coppola maintains that he simply encountered that version of the ritual among the Filipino people he was working with, but surprisingly, a similar ritual is also performed among the Kachok living in Ratanakiri along Tonle Srepok. It’s probably a coincidence, but interesting nonetheless.  If you want to see TonleSrepok before it merges with other rivers, the best place is Lumphat. Alternatively, Road no. 76 runs south from Lumphat, across the Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary, and along Tonle Srepok, and for the first couple of kilometers, this road is about 2 km from the river. Further south, the road diverges to a distance of about 15 km, and having a guide vastly increases the chance of finding the river, and more importantly, finding the way back to the road. Due to the presence of unexploded ordnance, you should not stray off well-trodden paths.",vietnam war film locations rivers film war history military

Often less busy than its more famous counterparts, the temple has an interesting history and hidden statue. It has a wonderful approach along its long, raised processional path passing between the remains of its reflection pools. Built in the 11th century as the state temple for Udayadityavarman II, Baphuon was originally dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. But in the late 15th century, the three-tiered temple was converted to a Buddhist site. As a result of this conversion, hidden on the west-facing section of the third enclosure wall is a giant reclining Buddha.  The brickwork forming the reclining Buddha image is nine meters (30 feet) tall and 70 meters (230 feet) long. The statue was built into the west side of the temple’s second level, which probably required the demolition of an eight-meter (26-foot) tower to supply stones for the statue. Walking around the base of the temple is uncanny, as what initially appears to be oddly-placed blocks in the wall start to take on the shape of the Buddha’s face. Almost as soon as you see it, the image starts to disappear again as the profile changes once you are directly opposite. The temple was constructed on land filled with sand. Due to its immense size, the site was incredibly unstable throughout its history. It is thought that large portions had already collapsed by the time the Buddha was added. By the 20th century, much of the temple had collapsed. A large-scale restoration project saw the temple dismantled so that its core could be strengthened before its reconstruction. This process was interrupted when the Cambodian Civil War broke out in 1970. Archaeologists were forced to leave the 300,000 blocks carefully numbered and organized over 10 hectares of land surrounding the temple site. Unfortunately, these plans were lost during the Khmer Rouge conflict. It was not until April 2011, after 51 years of work, that the restored temple was unveiled and the giant Buddha’s face once again stared serenely out of the complex once again.

Not only is it one of the newest mosques in the majority Buddhist country, it is also the largest. The impressive structure has been widely celebrated by Cambodia’s minority Muslim population, while at the same time creating rifts in the very community it was built to unite. Al-Serkal Mosque was inaugurated in March 2015 in the Boeng Kak neighborhood of Phnom Penh. Officially opened by Prime Minister Hun Sen, the inaugural ceremony was attended by more than 1,000 people. Among them was Eisa Bin Nasser Bin Abdullatif Alserkal, the Emirati businessman who funded the construction at a cost of $2.9 million. The walls inside the two-story Ottoman-style mosque are lined with rose and turquoise tiles, the ceramics commissioned from Algerian artisans. Its ceilings are decorated with mosaics, and a chandelier hangs from the central dome. To keep the faithful cool, the whole thing is air-conditioned. For Cambodia’s 350,000 or so Muslims (about 2 percent of the population), especially those in the capital, the construction of such a fine mosque was a grand achievement. The majority of Cambodia’s Muslim population is ethnic Cham. About 70,000 Cham Muslims died under the Khmer Rouge, and throughout the 1980s they were allowed limited religious freedom. It wasn’t long after the inauguration of the Al-Serkal Mosque, however, that rifts began to form in the Muslim community for which the mosque was built. In 2016, a planned road-building project was announced which would see a new road run right through the land on which the mosque sits. Many members of the local Cham Muslim community were opposed to the construction, as the road, if built, would destroy the tranquility of the mosque, ruining the peace and calm of prayer. Some of the Cham leadership, however, supported its construction, arguing that the road would ease traffic congestion and flooding, as well as bring new opportunities and greater prosperity to the area. Protests ensued, politicians got involved, accusations began to fly, and the whole issue caused quite a stir. The road project seems to have stalled for now, and could well be scrapped—or the proposed route changed – to appease angered locals. As for the mosque, it remains a much-loved hub for the Muslim community of Phnom Penh and of Cambodia as a whole.  Al-Serkal Mosque is located at 1 St. 86, not far from the city center of Phnom Penh. There's a large parking area if you drive yourself, or you can get there by taxi/tuk-tuk. You'll find a few halal stalls and restaurants in the area around the mosque.

The strangely intact airport exists as a somber reminder of the atrocities committed under Pol Pot’s rule. The military airport was the product of forced labor under the horrific governance of the Khmer Rouge, followers of the communist regime that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. Construction on this military airbase began in 1977, but it was never completed—the project was abandoned in 1979 when Vietnamese forces invaded and occupied Cambodia. Though never used for any actual aviation, the land holds several abandoned roadways leading to shells of old buildings, water tanks, and the vast airstrips themselves. Adjacent to the runway is a small control tower-type building. Thousands of workers died while building the airport. They were forced to work in inhumane conditions under the reign of the radical regime. Many of the laborers were members of the military who had been sent to work at the site as a punishment. Their work was overseen by engineers from China, as the Chinese government had a keen interest in helping build the airport.  While the roads leading to decaying buildings are easily accessible, there is a guard posted at the runway. They may be unconcerned by your presence, or you may not be allowed to pass. Alternately, some visitors have been required to pay a ""fee."" Going with someone that speaks Khmer is the least stressful way to access the site.

25,Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia","Bombed and burned, this monument represents the often controversial ties between Vietnam and Cambodia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cambodia-vietnam-friendship-monument,"The Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument stands in a normally peaceful park near the center of Phnom Penh. But that peace has been shattered on a number of occasions, by political activists who see the monument more as a memorial to the Vietnamese occupation. On December 25, 1978, Vietnam invaded the state of Democratic Kampuchea in present-day Cambodia. Its ultimately successful goal was the removal of the Khmer Rouge government from power, but the invasion also led to a 10-year occupation of the country. In 1979, the occupying Vietnamese built a large concrete monument in Botum Park, not far from the Royal Palace in the heart of Phnom Penh. Built in the distinctly communist socialist-realist style, it features two soldiers standing side-by-side, one Vietnamese and one Cambodian, with a Cambodian woman holding a baby as she stands under their protective gaze. Behind them rises the concrete tower, its top decorated with gold. On a typical day in Botum Park, this monument is the backdrop for family gatherings, friendly games of soccer, enthusiastic aerobics sessions, and occasional concerts. But in the last 20 or so years, the monument has also attracted the wrath of activists and protesters. They see the statue as a gross oversimplification of the former alliance between Vietnam and Cambodia, and a representation of the overly-close ties between Cambodian political leaders and Hanoi. The first major attack on the monument came in 1998, when opposition protesters attacked the statue with hammers before climbing it, dousing it with petrol and setting it alight. It was repaired two months later. Then, on July 29, 2007, a 10-kilogram bomb detonated at the base of the monument. The park was evacuated and two more devices were defused. Despite the blast, no one was injured and the monument suffered little damage. In 2015, a newly formed Cambodian think tank controversially argued for the removal of the monument and others like it. These statues were problematic, they argued, as they didn’t represent an accurate depiction of the civil war period, and were nothing more than “occupation memorials that continue to divide Cambodia.” The open letter from the think tank stated that more inclusive memorials should be erected in place of the existing monuments. These would ideally go far beyond the oversimplified Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument and its like, recognizing the full extent of the decades-long war while addressing the “geopolitical power struggles, instigated by the US, the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Britain and France” that also played a role. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the debate gained little traction and the old monuments still stand. So for now, at least, the Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument remains a focal point of Botum Park, where locals practice their afternoon exercises and friendly games of sepak takraw.  The gold-topped Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument is easy to spot when you arrive in Botum Park. It's a good place for people watching throughout the day, although the best atmosphere is often after 5 p.m. when people come to hang out, exercise, and play sports.",activism protest war history parks monuments military

They rely on a unique tool for locating buried land mines: Giant African Pouched Rats. APOPO was founded in 1997 by Bart Weetjens, a Belgian product designer who was searching for a more affordable way to help clear landmines. As an owner of pet rats, he knew that they were intelligent, social creatures with a keen sense of smell, and reasoned that they could be trained to detect buried landmines, small arms, and unexploded ordnance. The group’s HeroRATs, as they call them, are specially trained to sniff out mines (and tuberculosis). They can smell as little as one trillionth of a gram of TNT a meter deep in the ground. This incredible nonprofit has drastically increased both safety and productivity in the finding of unexploded ordnance. An area the size of a tennis field would take a human about four days to search, while the same area can be covered in 30 minutes by one rat. The APOPO Visitor Center is centrally located, and shares a variety of engaging and powerful history within the Vietnam War and the different global roles within this war.

Sadly, their peculiarities and rareness have put them in danger, and they are increasingly under threat in the wild. Although protected under Cambodian law, the rare scaly anteater is endangered in the wild where it is poached for meat and for its scales. These nocturnal forest dwellers are mild mannered and slow, making them an unfortunately easy target. Of the eight species of pangolin, two of them are considered endangered, including the Sunda, or Malay, Pangolin native to Southeast Asia. Their natural predators are tigers and other wild cats, but humans are the greatest danger to their long term survival. Pangolin meat is valued in parts of Asia as an exotic dish, fetching high prices in the black market. Its scales are ground up and used as an aphrodisiac. While no one knows the exact extent of the black market trade, in 2013 a Chinese ship containing 10,000 kilograms of pangolin meat ran aground in a protected coral reef in the Philippines, giving some sense of the vast scale of the market. The sanctuary at Phnom Tamao Zoological Park opened in 2012 to protect and provide sanitary for animals no longer able to get by in the wild, often found injured by hunter’s traps.

Today, the FCC has retained the atmosphere of its earlier days, although the clientele has shifted from war reporters to expats and visiting tourists. After the signing of the Paris Peace Agreements of October 1991, foreign journalists started to pour into Phnom Penh as Cambodia began its move towards peace and stability. Decades of turmoil, of civil war and Cold War intrigues, had torn the country apart, and the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge were yet to be put on trial. Lacking a place to call their own, and bored of drinking in rundown bars in the capital, a small group of journalists came up with the idea of establishing their own club for expatriate reporters and photographers in Phnom Penh. So was born the Foreign Correspondents Club, located in a three-story colonial-style building with exceptional views over the Tonle Sap River. The doors opened in June 1993. During the launch party, co-founder and Agence France-Presse correspondent Leo Dobbs stood up on one of the club’s wooden art deco-like chairs and made a succinct but important announcement: the FCC, he told the gathered revelers, “is a place where we can offer friendship between Cambodians and the rest of the world.” Over the following years, the FCC played a vital role for journalists in Cambodia. Not only as a bar and restaurant, it also became a leading cultural and intellectual center in Phnom Penh. It held panel discussions on human rights, press conferences, photo exhibitions, and featured a range of guest speakers and panelists from various walks of life, including politicians, authors, dancers, journalists, royal biographers, and Buddhist monks. Today, the FCC remains an iconic landmark in Phnom Penh, although the link between the club and the foreign correspondents it was created for has diminished. It’s still just as popular, but you’re more likely to find regular locals, expats, and tourists sipping gin and tonic at the bar rather than war photographers from Reuters. That said, the FCC does retain much of its old atmosphere, and the sense of history and adventure is palpable as you sit beneath the ceiling fans, looking out across the river. You never know when a journalist or a high-level diplomat might pop in. In 2016, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited the FCC before a series of meetings with Cambodian leaders.  The FCC is now a hotel, restaurant, and bar, all open to the public (accredited foreign correspondents still receive a discount). The menu includes various cocktails and plenty of dining options, many of which blend Cambodian and Western influences.

32,Avatar Hallelujah Mountain,"Zhangjiajie, China",This vertical pinnacle in China was the inspiration for the floating mountains in the movie “Avatar.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/avatar-hallelujah-mountain,"It wasn’t until 1982 that China created its first national park: Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. They couldn’t have chosen a better site—Zhangjiajie is famous for its 3,000 vertical pillars, each standing hundreds of feet tall and covered in dense green foliage. These pillars were formed by erosion and draw in upwards of 30 million tourists every year. One of these pillars was named the “Southern Sky Column,” and it stretches 3,544 feet into the air, the length of 78 school buses. In a strange turn of art imitating life imitating art, in 2010 the name was changed to “Avatar Hallelujah Mountain” after the highest-grossing film of all time, Avatar, used photographs of the pinnacle as inspiration for the floating Hallelujah Mountains of Pandora. This was part of a successful attempt to bring more tourists into the national park, using phrases like “Pandora is far but Zhangjiajie is near” and “discover the real world of Pandora.” This, of course, was not all good news for the Chinese government. The state-run “China Film Group” was afraid that Avatar would inspire people to make connections between the plight of Pandora’s fictional “Na’vi” people, who were being displaced from their land for the purpose of economic expansion, and the plight of the millions of real Chinese civilians being evicted from their homes to serve the interests of urban developers. Hence, in a wildly controversial move, just 14 days after being released in China, Avatar was prematurely taken off of 1,628 2D screens. Two weeks too late. By that point Avatar had already become China’s highest-grossing film of all time, and “Avatar Hallelujah Mountain” continues to be the name of the pinnacle, despite the government’s censorship efforts of the film. The connection to Avatar has surged the popularity of Zhangjiajie. To cater to the more adventurous tourists in the area, a new attraction was built in the national park in 2015: the longest glass bridge in the world.",government national parks film locations film mountains bridges

On the contrary, Houtouwan may well be the most verdant and stunningly green village the world over, as nearly every building is overgrown with ivy and other lush vegetation. This green gem, situated about 40 miles from Shanghai, was once an active settlement, inhabited by around 2,000 fishermen and their families. In the early 1990s, when the small bay became increasingly unable to meet the growing fish industry’s needs, residents began migrating to the mainland in search of other employment and a better life, a pattern that was common in many small Chinese villages. Slowly, nearly every house was abandoned, and only a handful of residents now remain. Over the past two decades, the forces of green took over, plastering nearly every surface of the settlement with dense overgrown foliage. Adding to the otherworldliness, a peek inside the deserted houses reveals decaying household items and pieces of furniture frozen exactly as they were placed years ago before the inhabitants left. Now, some villagers who used to live in Houtouwan have found another form of income in tourism, showing an ever-increasing stream of visitors the lush landscape, and selling them water, the only item on offer on the island. The scenery is green as far as the eye can see, making this a wondrous sight, and a photographer’s paradise.",abandoned houses color fishing environment villages islands natural wonders abandoned plants nature

Separated into an inner and outer court, the Forbidden City forms a rectangle several thousand feet long and wide, with a moat surrounding all four sides.  The huge estate contains five major gates and numerous halls, large and small, each with grandiose names such as the “Gate of Divine Might” and the “Hall of Literary Glory.” Construction began in 1402 and lasted for 16 years, employing over a million workers.  It served as the seat of the Ming Dynasty from 1420 until 1644, at which point it housed the heads of the Qing Dynasty until 1912. After the Emperor Puyi abdicated in 1912, the Forbidden City underwent several periods of turmoil, including the evacuation (some would say theft) of numerous artifacts to Taiwan in 1948 by a fleeing Chian Kai-shek of the Guomindang.  It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, and today the entire complex is part of the Palace Museum, whose collection includes over ten thousand ancient fans, among other artifacts and priceless works of Chinese art.  Besides the pieces contained inside, visitors can admire the high imperial architecture, as well as a mingling of religious influences including Taoism, Manchu shamanism, and Tibetan Buddhism.

Filled with awe-inspiring creatures known only to China it has been dubbed “Fairy Land on Earth.” Over millennia of geological change, mineral deposits built up and naturally created the travertine pools of Huanglong. Formed out of limestone, the hot springs rose to varied levels, making the light blue water cascade over waterfalls into other series of pools and even hollowing out caves along the valley. With rugged, snow-capped peaks on both sides, the slicing river of hot springs looks almost like a dragon, earning the title of “Yellow Dragon.” In many ways, the backdrop of this UNESCO site is as dramatic as the pools. Untouched forests gently slope toward the water, and Golden Snub-Nosed Monkeys and Giant Pandas have made the fantasy world their home. The most scenic 2.2 miles begin at the Benbo temple and gradually wind their way to the Xishen Cave Waterfalls where the main site ends.

Where did the rainbow come from? The answer is not as magical as one might hope: different layers of sandstone dating back millions of years.

Luoxiagou, a small village in the Dongchuan Red Land, is actually that colorful, and that breathtaking, and truly exists in southern China. The area earned the name “Red Land” due to its striking colors. The base color of the earth in Luoxiagou is tinted with oxidized iron. Nearly saturated with the mineral, the dirt has taken on a dark brown and reddish hue. Yet the soil is only the beginning of the fantastic countryside. Some 26,00 feet above sea level, an ocean of farmland and white flowers grow from farmland splotched with patches of oxidized red dirt. Without much infrastructure or government organization, the region is largely comprised of unaffiliated farmers who plant individual crops on the terraced slopes of the province. Although the lack of organization has left the area underdeveloped, it has also caused the stark differences in color and crop in the swimming farmland of Luoxiagou, and has made the land a stunning natural portrait.",color martian landscapes farms geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems geology nature

After hopping into a small, futuristic rail car, riders are leisurely carried through a tunnel which is covered in pulsing, strobing lights that attempt to simulate flight through some acid-soaked version of space. The bombardment of flashing lights and colors is accompanied by a rather ominous soundtrack punctuated by an occasional intonation of English words such as “…shining star…” and “…hell…” It is unclear whether the ride is trying to evoke wonder or terror, but both reactions seem appropriate.

There, after ascending to the top of the Great Wall via gondola, chairlift, or foot, you can return to the base by zooming down a steep, zig-zagging slide, with views of the Great Wall along the way. The ride, which runs adjacent to the wall, lasts about five minutes depending on how much you apply the brakes with the joystick attached to your cart.

Over the millennia seismic activity and water and wind erosion have carved the present-day limestone formations. The giant stalagmite-like pillars create huge arrays of labyrinths that are easy to become lost in. Shilin is divided into many smaller stone forests and features caves, waterfalls, ponds, a lake with an island, and even an underground river. Two of the smaller individual stone forests, Naigu Stone Forest and Suogeyi Village, are a part of the South China Karst, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. One of Shilin’s most famous attractions is the Ashima Stone, which legend says was formed after the beautiful Sani girl, Ashima, ran into the forest and was turned to stone after being forbidden to marry the man she loved.

Allegedly, its landscape even inspired the scenery of James Cameron’s Avatar. But it’s not rock formations or trees that tourists have been flocking for lately–it’s a bridge. A 1,400-foot-long, 900-foot-high bridge made out of glass. This bridge, opened in the summer of 2016, comes as part of a trend in glass suspension structures. There’s “Brave Men’s Bridge”, located in the same natural preserve as the Zhangjiajie bridge, as well as a swath of other Chinese glass bridges in both urban and natural settings. All of these have been constructed within a decade of each other, each trumping the last in superlatives. The Zhangjiajie glass bridge currently holds the record as both the longest and the highest in the world. The appeal of these attractions is both the ability to see the natural landscape below one’s feet and the element of fear inherent in walking on such a massive structure made of delicate material. As if that wasn’t enough to terrify, one of China’s other glass walkways cracked under the feet of visitors just two weeks after its opening. Though authorities assured the public the crack in the glass was merely superficial and no one was in any danger, it’s understandable why people were scared. When the Zhangjiajie bridge was unveiled, a number of publicity events were staged to prove the bridge’s sturdiness, including driving a car across it and whacking the inches-thick glass panes with sledgehammers.

The futuristically modern museum is packed with wax watermelons, displaying the various varieties from around the world, surrounded by abundant neon lighting. The displays cover just about every aspect of watermelons from their history, to growing methods, to China’s “watermelon culture.” There are ancient Chinese poems on display that make reference to melons, and all sorts of informational signs and plaques. Even the building itself is emblazoned with a giant impressionistic watermelon over the front doors. And if you find the permanent fake melons a bit disingenuous,  there is also an outdoor exhibition area where a number of actual watermelon varieties are growing. This museum is definitely about watermelons.

Mount Hua actually consists of five separate peaks, each with a temple on it thanks to the religious significance that has been ascribed to the mountain for centuries. However, the most remote peak to the south is home to a temple that has incorporated a tea ceremony to answer the demands of the increased number of visitors who are drawn to the site by the pull of danger. To reach the temple, you must begin at a series of steps known as the “Heavenly Stairs,” a long trail of stone steps carved right into the mountain that is so steep, one slip could cause hikers to tumble down them uncontrollably. Or, you can take a rickety gondola that ferries hikers high above a mountain valley to the base of the northern peak. For the ascent of the southern peak, the trail almost completely disappears as hikers must sidle along the sheer mountainside across a thin ledge made of what looks like scrap wood, stapled and lashed together like an afterthought. Even the planks fall away at some point leaving nothing but a chain and some pegs to stand on, hundreds of feet off the ground. Once past this section, another set of worn stairs leads to the temple, although their sharp grade makes the previous steps seem like child’s play. Thanks to the increasing number of visitors to the site in recent years, the Chinese government has taken steps to make the route safer, by shoring up the ledge planks and cementing in more guide chains. However despite the increased safety precautions a number of hikers each year continue to plummet to their deaths from the dizzying trail.

The city has been around for nearly 2,000 years, filling it with a spooky sense of the past. Its origin story begins back in the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), when two officials decided to run away to the area and live out their lives, where they eventually, the story goes, became immortal. Yin and Wang, the names of the officials, were combined during a later dynasty to mean “King of the Underworld.” Most of the popular landmarks in the City of Ghosts have names that reference the afterlife: “Last Glance at Home Tower,” “Nothing-to-be-Done Bridge,” “Ghost Torturing Pass.” Covering the sites are statues and other artistic depictions of ghosts and devils — terrifying works that represent what happens to those who haven’t lived good lives after theirs is taken from them. Less popular, but no less fascinating is the theme park/haunted house made to represent the terrors within the afterlife, complete with neon paint and vendors hawking Scream masks alongside an alleyway. The giant face seen in the hill is called “The Ghost King,” and it holds a Guinness World Records title as the biggest sculpture carved on a rock.

Old Dragon’s Head is considered to be the start of the Great Wall, built during the Ming Dynasty, and it does resemble a dragon resting its weary head by the Bohai Sea. It served as a military fort, and a strategic defense from both land and sea attacks. Going down towards the sea, there are well-preserved remnants of the original wall, which was built using a mixture of glutinous rice syrup, earth, sand and lime.

Reaching over 1,600 feet tall, they are roughly the same height as the world’s tallest buildings. This area also shares a mysterious property with some three dozen other deserts around the world. Known as singing sands, whistling sands, or booming dunes, the dunes of the Badain Jaran Desert make a surprising amount of noise. Despite singing sands and booming dunes being a feature shared by some 35 deserts and beaches around the world, the mechanism that makes the sound is still not fully understood. Singing sands are believed to be generated when the desert wind pulls the top layer of sand off the layer below. It is thought that the noise is generated by an electrostatic charge this action creates. On a small scale, such as a beach, this phenomenon creates a high-pitched sound, but on a much larger scale, it can emit a low-pitched rumble or booming sound, and at up to 105 decibels, it can be quite loud. A booming sand dune manifests itself by initiating an avalanche from the leeward face of a large dune. The resulting low-frequency booming noise or music is loud and resembles a low-flying propeller airplane. The sound is surprisingly monotone with one dominant audible frequency. It is sustained and may continue for up to a minute after initiation, even after all visible motion has ceased. Moving a hand through the dry sand of a booming dune shears the upper layer and generates another acoustic phenomenon, the burping emission - pulse-like, short bursts of sound. Booming dunes are silent in the wintertime when moisture from precipitation is retained in the dune. The burping property depends on sand grain characteristics and can be generated all year around. In the summer time when the larger dunes produce their music, the smaller dunes in the dune field remain silent. This indicates that structural properties of the dune are critical for the generation of the singing sand. Also, booming can only be generated at slopes at the angle of repose (30 degrees) on the leeward face of dune; the same sand on the shallower windward side cannot generate the music.",singing sands world's tallest sounds martian landscapes geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems geology nature
55,Maijishan Grottoes,"Tianshui, China","Rock-cut caves and 7,000 Buddhist sculptures carved into the nearly sheer face of a sandstone mountain.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maijishan-grottoes,"So precarious and improbable, the Maijishan Grottoes come across as science fiction. Perhaps a dystopian world where humans are forced to tunnel into mountains and stay high above the ground to avoid predators below, boxing themselves into an ant-hill like village best explains the wonder. Built over 1,500 years ago, the Maijishan Grottoes are a series of 194 caves carved into the nearly sheer face of a sandstone mountain. High above the frosted lands of Gansu, Maijishan’s face looks like a sponge. Black holes punctuate the rock wall and highlight the massive Buddhist statues carved into the rock. Situated in the far North of China’s modern territory, the caves evolved throughout time, morphing with influence from new cultures and peoples. They continued to change over 12 dynasties, keeping a Buddhist thread throughout its evolution. Although this common theme exists, and the caves feature over 7,000 Buddhist statues, there is significant variation between the statues. Many of the statues, especially those inside the caves are exquisite, and ornately decorated. These more elaborate statues were generally not created with indigenous stone, meaning the rock for these huge ornate statues was hauled up the mountain sides from somewhere else. Strain as much as you like, but you will not find a satisfactory answer for every question the grottoes pose. Regardless, the beauty of these mysterious caves and carvings transcends beyond archeological mysteries.",grottoes buddhism temples sculptures ruins

Covered in lush, green vegetation, the natural formations create a dramatic landscape best viewed from Yangshuo’s natural arch, known as Moon Hill. Having drawn visitors with its unique formation for many years, Moon Hill was first climbed by Todd Skinner in the 1990s. Skinner was famous for his free climbing ability, and helped popularize the area with backpackers and hikers visiting China. Although there are climbing routes on Moon Hill, most visitors take the easier path to the summit, or the trail that goes through the arch. Besides Moon Hill, Yangshuo is popular with visitors looking to take cave tours or bike through the magnificent landscape created almost entirely out of karst formations.  Biking to Moon Hill from Yangshuo county is very popular when you on the western street; you can cycle along the head towards the main road from your hotel. This path will lead you down to a large weir where you can cross the river. From here a small path but will take you through Fen Lou Village to the Jin Bao River. Cross the river and take the concrete road turning right when it meets the main road and bike 5 min to Moon Hill.

57,Ming Dynasty Tombs,"Beijing, China",Ming Dynasty necropolis raided during the Cultural Revolution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ming-dynasty-tombs,"China’s political situation over the last 70 years could easily be described as manic. Mao Zedong proclaimed his country the People’s Republic of China in 1949, and quickly began a long and troubled relationship with China’s history, that seemed to sway with his moods. Unfortunately for many historical sites like the Dingling tomb, moving out of Mao’s favor meant sanctioned disaster. Built in the 15th century, the Ming Dynasty Necropolis is one of the largest in the world and was chosen specifically at the feet of the Tianshou Mountain for its feng shui. The necropolis holds all of the Ming Emperors until the end of the dynasty in 1644, but many supposed the real gems of the area were hidden beneath the extravagant tombs. In 1956, a group of archeologists proposed a scholarly excavation of the Dingling tomb in preparation for uncovering the secrets of the largest Ming Tomb, the Changling. Given a brief window to explore and uncover the tomb’s treasures and history, the team hurriedly excavated and formed a museum on the site, which held Ming crowns, jewelry and the skeletons of the Wanli Emperor and his wife. The museum and site, although hardly maintained, honored the Ming Dynasty. Only a decade later, the Cultural Revolution was in full swing, and a new fate arrived at the tomb. A group of Red Guards, with full sanction from the state, visited the tombs and began a horrible raid on the Dingling tomb. They destroyed priceless Ming artifacts and pulled out the skeletons of the Wanli Emperor and Empress. Denouncing them as bourgeoisie, the guards proceeded to light the bones on fire in front of a crowd in the necropolis. Today, the government has adopted a new policy because of the excavation debacle and will only excavate a historical site for restoration.

58,Guoliang Tunnel,"Guoliang, China",A tunnel dug through the side of a mountain by hand provides convenient yet death-defying access to a small village in China.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guoliang-tunnel,"The village of Guoliang had a problem. High in the Taihang Mountains of the Henan Province, the only access to civilization were some steep, narrow stairs embedded in the mountainside called the “Sky Ladder”, a treacherous, slippery climb even for the most nimble and sure-footed of the villagers or their rare company callers. For several years, the 350 inhabitants of this isolated location beseeched the government for a roadway to connect them to the outside world, but their pleas fell on deaf ears. Undeterred, they decided that if the officials refused to help them, they would do it themselves. Selling their animals and other necessities for supplies, the people of Guoliang sent down 13 of their strongest workers. The team of men, not an engineer among them, set about carving a roadway inch by inch, using nothing but hand tools, patience, and determination. In 1977, 5 years after beginning their colossal undertaking, the villagers had managed to dig out 0.75 mi. of tunnel, 16 ft. tall and 13 ft. wide. While quite the amazing feat, a do-it-yourself mountain tunnel dug by hand is obviously not the pillar of safety, in fact in many spots of the tunnel, roughly carved pillars are the only thing keeping you from plunging to your death. Several villagers died during construction, and the road itself is only wide enough for the very slow, careful passing of oncoming cars. This is made terrifying by the fact that the road was built on the path of least resistance. The tunnel twists, turns and dips in unpredictable places, enough to leave any driver white-knuckled in terror at what could be coming at them around the slippery blind spot of a bend. Originally intentioned to provide the Guoliang residents with some convenience, the tunnel has become quite the tourist attraction, giving the village a little too much unwanted attention, but some very welcome revenue. There are now hotels and bridges that have been built for hikers and travelers, but access isn’t always granted, so make sure to check the internet for updates on the current visiting status. The Village of Guoliang is about 120 kilometers or 75 miles north of the city of Zhengzhou in the Wanxianshan Scenic Area. If you want to go there by train, the nearest train station is at Xinxiang at (新乡) that is about 50 miles southeast of the Wanxianshan Scenic Area. From there, you can take buses to the town of Huixian 辉县. Get off at the Huxian Bus Station, and then take another bus to the Wanxianshan Scenic Area. This leg costs about 6 RMB or 1 USD and takes 30 minutes. From there, there are buses that cost 11 RMB that go the the scenic area. This leg takes about two hours though it is only about 40 miles away because the buses make many stops. The bus lets you off at the scenic area at a place where you can hire another ride or hike the 4 kilometers to Guoliangcun or 2.5 kilometers to another village called Nanping.",tunnels subterranean sites architectural oddities architecture

In the Shanxi region of central China, the monk Tan Yao and other Buddhists began carving sculpture-filled caves around the capital city of Pingcheng (now Datong). Between 465 AD and 525, 45 caves, 252 shrines, and 51,000 sculptures were built. The carvings span over one kilometer along the side of the mountain. The walls of the caves are lined with sculptures of Buddha in different positions, though most feature the Sakyamuni, a young Buddha, in a seated position. The sculptures range in size from barely two centimeters to over 17 meters high. Though the carvings are exposed to the elements, they have been preserved by many efforts. The Liao Dynasty from 1049-1060 attempted to correct some erosion. Additionally, after a fire in 1621, the Qing Dynasty rebuilt extensive parts of the sculptures. Lastly, the People’s Republic of China list the grottoes as a key cultural site to be protected by the government. They have stopped illegal construction around the caves and saved many grottoes near collapse. In 2001, the grottoes were made an UNESCO Site of World Heritage.",caves ecosystems sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
60,Tianjin Binhai Library,"Tianjin, China",China’s breathtaking futuristic library is lined floor to ceiling with fake books.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tianjin-binhai-library,"When the Binhai Library opened in the Chinese coastal city of Tianjin in October of 2017, it attracted a flood of visitors and a flurry of social media photos straight away. And no wonder, considering it is absolutely stunning. At first glance, the bright white atrium appears to be covered with row upon swirling row of colorful books stacked on a continuous wave of curving, terraced shelves. That is not altogether true, however. While the library’s modern design is unquestionably beautiful, there is a slight catch: The books lining this literary repository are not actually real. The majority of the “books” in the room are in fact printed images of book spines papered onto the back of the shelving to give the appearance of rows of tomes. If you take a closer look at the stunning photos of the space, it is easy to tell the real books apart from the flat replicas. The building, designed by the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, is an impressive 36,000 square feet and five stories high, with the capacity to fit over a million books in its collection. As of yet, it only stores about 200,000 volumes, housed in the library’s more traditional reading rooms. In fact, the curved continuum of shelves in the main room are actually meant to be used as seating and steps for visitors, giving the feeling you are lost in an undulating sea of words. They surround a huge, gleaming white spherical auditorium that stands at the center of the room. When seen from the park outside the library, the unique space resembles a giant eye, and has already been dubbed “The Eye of Binhai.” Given the masterful, though controversial, optical illusion at play, it seems an appropriate nickname. The library is part of an ambitious urban cultural center developed by the city of Tianjin. Nearby is the Tianjin Grand Theatre, Art Gallery, Natural History Museum, Science and Technology Museum and other venues.",spheres hoaxes libraries books design architecture

It has been successfully completed and opened to the public in November 2018 , it is also be one of the most eco-friendly places to stay in China. Built into an abandoned quarry about 20 miles from Shanghai, the hotel includes two underwater floors and a green rooftop that blends into the surrounding countryside. The unique design takes advantage of the location and natural elements such as the rocky cliffs, waterfalls, and surrounding hills. A glass waterfall atrium pours over the façade, where all 14 floors of above the water level rooms have balconies and views of the quarry. The underground floors include under water rooms and a restaurant that face a 33-foot-long aquarium, plus a leisure complex, swimming pool, and water sports. The hotel’s roof is above ground level and is partly covered with grass and trees to fit into the surrounding topography and preserve the local environment. Adjacent to the hotel is a theme park with a glass walkway and observation platform overhanging the quarry cliffs. The luxury resort hotel is not only a dazzling design concept: It was built to prevent further ecological damage to the environment around it and features an extensive sustainability program. The hotel is in fact an example of ‘Passive ‘sustainability, using the micro climate of the quarry and the thermal inertia if the rocky cliffs cooling in the summer and heating in the winter. An engineering marvel, the Shimao Wonderland Intercontinental was designed by British Architect Martin Jochman, initially with the same British firm that designed the stunning Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai  and  later with his own studio JADE+QA. It took 12 years to build partially because novel solutions were needed to transport materials down into the quarry. The chief engineer called it a “fight with gravity” that took more than 5,000 architects, engineers, designers, and workers to build.  The hotel is now open to the public and is extremely popular with visitors. The resort will have 337 guest rooms, a conference centre that can accommodate 1,000, and a series of restaurants and banquet facilities.",quarries environment underground places to stay hotels design

The park, which was opened in 2011, is a sprawling video game themed attraction in one of China’s busiest cities. The park is split into two distinct sections: half of the park is a fantasy pastiche reminiscent of the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft, and the other half is a science-fiction world, shockingly similar to the strategy game, Starcraft. The fantasy half of the park, known as the “Terrain of Magic,” is full of larger-than-life statues of fantastic characters that are cribbed straight out of the popular game, but with an altered color scheme or other small alteration. Warriors, satyrs, elves, and demons all stand boldly in the face of copyright law. Even the architecture of the castles and orcish huts seem to have been rendered straight from the game world. Most of the rides are genre-themed versions of popular amusement park staples such as the log flume and roller coasters of all stripes. Over in the “Universe of Starship,” visitors can walk among the eerily identical halls of the futuristic buildings which are designed exactly the same as the digital fortresses of Starcraft. The park’s largest ride, a huge, blue roller coaster named the “Sky Scrapper,” is contained within the “Universe” and provides a reasonably futuristic look to the skyline. Similarities to any Blizzard Entertainment (owners of both Starcraft and Warcraft) properties aside, World Joyland is a truly incredible sight with its limitless statues and sincere love for the fantasy worlds it creates.

Works from Chinese artists Ai WeiWei and Wenda Gu are flying off the shelves, and Christie’s and Sotheby’s can’t get enough. Art prices are growing even faster than China’s explosive economy, and the 798 is at the center of this boom. The 798 thrives on irony. Tiny shops sell kitschy Maoist junk, or T-shirts displaying “Obamao.” The greatest irony of all, though, are the buildings itself. The entire complex is built in a Cultural Revolution-era warehouse district, with the Moaist slogans still emblazoned in big red letters in some of the gallery spaces, urging the proletariat to work hard for Mother China. The factories give the area a gritty feel, and the district was actually almost closed by the government in 2003. Mao was a great patron of the arts, but he probably didn’t have this in mind. The actual district is a mixture of galleries, museums, shops, and cafes. It’s large enough that it would be hard to see everything in an afternoon, but it is great for perusing and exploring.

Underneath your now trembling legs are thick panels, 25 times stronger than normal glass. Staring down into the abyss is possibly the scariest part of the crossing, but perhaps not the most impressive. At almost 300 meters (980 feet) across, this was the longest glass suspension bridge in the world for a brief time. It connects two peaks in the rocky terrain of the national park in Hunan Province, the region believed to have inspired the film Avatar. It didn’t hold its title of “world’s longest” for very long. In 2016 a 1,400 foot glass bridge was constructed in the nearby Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon, looming twice as high as Brave Men’s bridge.

65,Shanghai's 1933 Slaughterhouse,"Shanghai, China","Rivers of cattle blood gone, a strange Escheresque building remains, the last of its kind.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/1933-slaughterhouse,"Once one of the largest slaughterhouses in the East, this poured concrete building is a study in a strange Escher-esque beauty. Built in 1933 in pre-Communist Shanghai, the four-story building was designed by British architects and built by Chinese developers with British concrete. Today the building is an eerie Gotham-Deco achievement in concrete, glass, and steel, and the last remaining of its design in the world. Since its retirement as an abattoir the building has served many purposes, from medicine factory and cold storage to “lifestyle center” where Ferrari owners meet. But the building’s unique design emerges from its original purpose: slaughtering cattle. The walls are 50 centimeters thick, and hollow to help control air temperature. Designed for efficiency, the hulking spiderweb of intertwining staircases, ramps, bridges and corridors was all part of guiding the flow both of thousands of workers to their stations, and of millions of cattle to their deaths. Rough floor surfaces prevented cattle from slipping, even on blood-slick floors. The lovely lattice windows on the outside were built to create maximum air circulation. The entire building was built around a central atrium that let in natural light. Cattle were herded through “air bridges” of varying width which controlled the animals’ flow, and the building’s sharp angles allowed small spaces for people to stand in, in case the cattle began to panic. However, despite the utilitarian purpose of the building, much thought was put into its style and decoration. The building is filled with decorative elements, such as beautifully designed Art Deco motifs in many of the windows and “flowering” columns. There is even a religious element to the design. All the windows were built facing west, the direction of the Buddhist holy land. This was thought to help aid the cattle’s process of reincarnation. On a more practical note, it is also the wind direction in Shanghai and helped to counter the smell of slaughter. Ultimately it is the interlocking staircases and twenty-six “air bridges” of varying width that connect the outer areas with the circular core that give the building its mind-bending M.C. Escher quality. If you’re interested in urban exploration, decay, architecture, or are looking for a stunning photo backdrop, 1933 Slaughterhouse is a must-see.

The concrete bridge is only a few feet across, but the elaborate design work used on the hand rails give the short span the feel of some ancient Chinese relic built by an ancient dynasty of some sort. The rift often fills with impenetrable clouds of fog that are common to the region (and which actually give the surrounding Xihai Grand Canyon its name, Xihai meaning “West Sea” referring to the foggy oceans of clouds surrounding the peaks). The bridge has earned the nickname the “Fairy Walking Bridge” thanks to the fantastical, otherworldly vibe that the pass has. In fact the entire hiking area is referred to as the “Magic Scenic Area” thanks to the stunning paths alont the cliff sides and other natural features such as a peak known as the “Cloud-Dispelling Pavilion” which tends to punch up through the cloud layer.

On its own, the East Taihang Glasswalk—a 3,800 foot tall glass-bottomed walkway in the towering mountains of eastern China—would be absolutely terrifying. But apparently, for the operators of the glass bridge, these heights are not scary enough: to truly petrify its guests, the bridge’s operators have used an optical illusion to make it appear as if the glass beneath your feet is cracking into pieces. As visitors to the East Taihang Mountains walk across a glass bridge thousands of feet high in the sky, a series of splintering cracks will suddenly begin to appear like a spider web on the floor. There is little that will make your heart pound more than staring down at the mountain valley hundreds of stories beneath your feet, and then discovering that the invisible layer of glass that has sustained your life so far appears to have been shattered. Fortunately for guests to the glasswalk, the bridge has never actually broken. The splintering of the glass is merely a prank, albeit one of the most provocative, high-tech, and absolutely terrifying ones in the world. The effect is accomplished with infrared sensors which track the movement of people walking across the bridge, triggering a dual visual and audio effect to give the impression that the glass walkway is fracturing into pieces. Upon looking at videos taken of the bridge, it’s clear that the breaking glass effect is just an illusion, as the “cracks” disappear after just a few seconds.

69,Longyou Caves,"Quzhou , China","Discovered after draining a local pond, these ancient man-made caves are still a complete mystery.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/longyou-caves,"For as long as anyone could remember the ponds of Longyou County were thought of as “bottomless,” but when one local set out to see how deep they really were he discovered the first in a series of massive hand-carved caves, the origin of which is almost a complete mystery. In 1992, in the Chinese village of Longyou, a uniquely curious local named Wu Anai pooled his money with his neighbors to buy a water pump and began siphoning out the pond in his village. The pond was one of many in the area that were used for washing, fishing, and other chores, and which were always said to be endlessly deep. Not satisfied with that fantastical depth, Anai completely drained one pond and found that it wasn’t really a pond at all, but the flooded entrance to an ancient, man-made cave. Soon other ponds in the area were also drained and they too were found to be strangely massive, hand-carved caves (24 in all). The huge caverns sink as deep as almost 100 feet and then sprawl out at the bottom. While none of the caves are connected many of them share thin walls that it is remarkable the primitive builders did not puncture. The walls of the caves are also covered in carved lines and symbols, the meaning of which has yet to be deciphered. And that’s hardly the only mystery. While the caverns have been dated back to around 200 BCE, there is no historical record of their construction, nor is there any evidence of the tools used to make them, or even their purpose. In addition no one is quite sure where the excavated rock went. The caves seem too big to have been the work of a small group villagers and it is thought that it would have taken over a thousand workers to build them in their day. While the origins of the caves are still unknown, they are now open to visitors willing to make the trek to the remote village. Hopefully someone can come back with some answers.",mystery caves ecosystems

From above the lake looks like a painter’s palette, with dabbles of magenta, green, and aquamarine across the landscape. Down on the surface, a yearly ritual has taken place for millennia. Workers slowly and painstakingly shovel piles of salt that are left behind as the water evaporates. These hunks of white crystal have helped grant Yuncheng a place of cultural and political esteem, and the chemical reactions catalyze an otherworldly landscape that enchants locals and phone-wielding tourists alike. Known as “China’s Dead Sea” for its salinity, the vast lake has long been the focal point of Yuncheng’s culture and economy. Chinese historians estimate that locals have consciously harvested salt from the lake for 6,000 years, and ancient human remains found in the area suggest that people may have realized the water’s salty benefit even further back. By the sixth century, Yuncheng lake was responsible for a quarter of China’s overall salt production. Local lore reports wars fought over possession of the lake, and nearby temples are dedicated to salt gods. The lake is connected to the signature tang in Shanxi’s food, which is replete with salty soy sauce. Today, most travelers come to the lake not to worship the salt gods, but to marvel at the landscape’s surreal charm. As opposed to the Dead Sea, which is filled with high concentrations of chloride that make it hostile to most forms of life, Yuncheng Lake is filled with sulfate, which supports a lush ecosystem. In the summer, algal blooms turn the water technicolor thanks to Dunaliella salina, an algae species that changes color when it reacts with salt. In winter, when the temperature dips below 23 degrees Fahrenheit, the salt forms crystals of mirabilite, also known as Glouber’s Salt, transforming the landscape into twinkling winter fantasy. Yuncheng salt was traditionally harvested for culinary use, through a five-step process that the Shanxi Province has officially recognized as a piece of the region’s intangible heritage. Since the 1980s, however, producers have abandoned this process and pivoted toward industrial harvesting. Locals hope that the influx of visitors interested in marveling at the lake can also help inspire the preservation of local salt harvesting traditions, and of the rich ecosystem that has given rise to an extraordinary natural beauty.  There are several buses that run from downtown Yuncheng to the lake. Other salt lakes in China have suffered extreme pollution due to tourist attention.

Located in the eastern Guizhou province of China, Fanjingshan is the highest peak of the Wuling Mountains, stretching 8,430 feet above sea level. Draped in dense forests filled with fir trees and Guizhou golden monkeys, it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2018. Like Avatar Hallelujah Mountain, Fanjingshan is much taller than it is wide, a vertical pinnacle that resembles a pencil standing on a desk. To reach the top, visitors have to walk up more than 8,000 steps or  take a cable car ride up from the road below. The two temples atop the mountain were each constructed on separate peaks, and guests must cross a small bridge to traverse the crevice between them. There are few more dramatic ways to reach a historic Buddhist temple than by crossing a mountain bridge in the clouds. Many Buddhists believe Fanjingshan to be the bodhimaṇḍa (place of enlightenment) of Maitreya, the “future Buddha.” According to Buddhist tradition, Maitreya will return to earth in the future to help others reach enlightenment. It’s unknown exactly when Fanjingshan was first constructed. Buddhism first came to the region in 639 during the Tang Dynasty, and the temples were likely constructed sometime after that. The temples were partially destroyed in the late 1500s during the Bozhou Rebellion, when members of the Miao ethnic group rose up against the Ming Dynasty and looted various sacred sites, but they have since been restored. After centuries of history, Fanjingshan stands today as one of the most dramatically-placed temples in China, a monument to Buddhism that will leave you breathless—especially if you make the 8,000 step ascent there.  Fanjingshan can be reached from the Chinese city of Tongren via a train or bus ride, or, for the less frugal, a two hour taxi ride.",unesco buddhism temples mountains religion sacred spaces history
73,The World Park,"Beijing, China",Beijing's World Park offers the excitement of international sites without the travel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-park,"Just 10 miles from downtown Beijing and Tienanmen Square, China’s World Park gives visitors a chance to see more than 100 of the planet’s best known landmarks – including the Great Pyramids, the Eiffel Tower, and the Statue of Liberty – all in miniature. The park is divided into five continents separated by four tiny “oceans”, intended to replicate the earth’s actual geographic layout. Guests can opt to circumnavigate the globe in miniature speedboats, take the overland route in battery operated cars, or board the park’s monorail for a transcontinental journey by train. Replicas at the World Park are built with painstaking attention to detail, and many of the landmarks have been constructed using materials intended to mimic the originals. World Park’s Red Square is paved with more than five million tiny bricks the size of Legos, and the Great Pyramids are built of 200,000 miniature white marble blocks. The park also contains a shrunken Manhattan, where the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers still dominate the New York skyline.  Unfortunately, the park is not well maintained and time is taking its toll on many of the monuments. In China, red tape and government restrictions make international travel difficult at best; but television and the internet are introducing a rapidly growing population to the allure of global culture. As a result, miniature attractions like World Park are cropping up in more places, including Grand World Scenic Park in Guangzhou and Window of the World in Shenzhen, where Chinese tourists can even visit a diminutive version of America’s own tiny realm –Disneyland.

You get your ghostly tongue sawed off in the afterlife by a finely muscled red boar demon, that’s what. Beijing’s Dongyue Temple is like the DMV of Daoist hells, an Asian Dante’s Inferno, a strip mall of underworld bureaucracy where justice is, at long last, served. Enclaves around the edges of the temple hold statues representing the 76 departments of the supernatural kingdom, including, you’ll be pleased to note, “The Department of Controlling Theft and Robbery,” the “Department of Distribution of Medication, the “Department of Paying Back Evil with Evil,” and the ever-popular “Unjust Death Department.” Appeals for posthumous vengeance or absolution can be made via a donation box at the mouth of each enclave, so if you’ve got a lot of beefs to rectify, bring a stack of small change. Construction started on the building in 1319, with the last round of post-Cultural Revolution renovations in 2002. If the hundreds of gruesome torture scenes enacted by animal-headed spirit totems aren’t your thing, the grounds are also pleasantly peppered with calligraphic stelles, including one credited to a Yuan Dynasty prince.

The historic observatory was originally built in 1442 during the Ming Dynasty, but was actually the evolution of an older, smaller observatory established in 1227. The eight original instruments for star-gazing were installed during the Ming Dynasty’s stewardship, but were stolen and returned a number of times over the years, both by invading countries and by changing political regimes. However the ancient steel instruments have always made their way back to the observatory. The ancient instruments include large versions of standard cartography tools such as an ornate sextant, and more exotic instruments such as the azimuth theodolite and the armillary sphere, both of which were used to measure stellar distances as best as they could given the technology. Much of the science behind the tools was based on a mix of Western and Eastern teachings, but all of the ancient instruments feature extensive Asian flourishes in the metalwork such as dragons, lions, and floral swirls. All of the tools at the Beijing Ancient Observatory are located outdoors on the top of an ancient building that was once known as the “Platform of Star-Watching.” The building itself is now part of the Beijing Planetarium and houses a museum dedicated to Chinese astronomy and any visitors to the site can not only see the stars, but through time itself.",observatories retro-tech astronomy instruments of science collections museums

As the water runs over these flat platforms, it forms dozens of miniature whitewater waterfalls, cascading down the mountain valley. Like the Pamukkale Water Terraces in Turkey, the river flows down the flat circular terraces like giant steps on a staircase or cakes stacked upon one another. Local legends of the Nakhi people claim the water in Blue Moon Valley gets its blue pigmentation from the raft that the gods took to the valley. In actuality, the river, which originates from the melting snow of the Himalayas above, gets its turquoise tint from copper ions in the water. While the terraces in Blue Moon Valley are mostly natural, the Chinese government has done several artificial interventions to make them look even more spectacular. It’s surely worked; the terraces, combined with the flowers, gorges, and meadows that surround them, make Blue Moon Valley one of the most scenic spots in all of China.",blue waterfalls rivers mountains natural wonders water nature
78,Marobo Hot Springs,East Timor,No one is quite sure of the origins of these idyllic natural hot springs at an abandoned mountain resort.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marobo-hot-springs,"Marobo is an isolated village on the border between the Ermera and Bobonaro provinces in Timor-Leste. Hidden in this remote part of the world, down a bumpy, turbulent dirt road, lay hot springs and the remains of what must have once been an idyllic retreat in a lush, tropical mountain setting. Who built this resort is a matter of contention. Though a few sources claim the Japanese constructed it during World War II, many others say the Portuguese created it during their 500-year colonial stint. The truth might sit somewhere between these two views, with the Japanese renovating and perhaps expanding what the Portuguese had previously started. Who built what exactly may never be known. What is known, however, is that the local population was forcibly mobilized to undertake the construction work in what is clearly a violation of human rights. Today, the only surviving remnants of this resort are a stone building, numerous terraced falls, and the pools, all set in a lush green landscape with a great view of the surrounding mountains. The hot springs produce nearly 530 gallons of water per minute, and have the characteristic pungent stank of sulphur. They also contain a large quantity of sodium and calcium. The highest temperature of the water is approximately 120°F, and is found where the small falls are. The roads from Maliana or from Bobonaro are paved but dangerous, with massive potholes and segments of road that have collapsed. The dirt road leading down to the hot springs is very steep and slippery. To reach this location, you need a 4x4 vehicle or a motorbike, but most of all, you need an experienced driver.",haikyo resorts hot springs hotels water ruins
79,Uma Lulik,"Lospalos, East Timor",These sacred totem houses connect the Fatakulu people with the spirits of their ancestors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uma-lulik,"The Fataluku people of Timor-Leste (East Timor) are an ethnic minority renowned for their elegant totem houses on stilts, sacred houses called uma lulik. These holy huts symbolize a link between the past and present, the dead and the living. There are traditional uma lulik still in place throughout the indigenous villages of East Timor, as well as several replica houses built more recently to honor the tradition and to display the Fataluku people’s craftsmanship. These homes, which are built or renovated every 10 to 20 years, serve as a bond between families. The rebuilding process strengthens the ties between the past and the present and families that members are born into and those they choose. A uma lulik belongs to a specific family, but it also stands for all other descendant groups that have formed a bond with it through marriages. Ultimately, uma lulik embody the spirit of the family, its network, history, traditions, and, inevitably, its essence. The presence of the uma lulik is as a testament to the resilience of the Fataluku people. First colonized by Portugal  in the 16th century, the island was later occupied by Japan and Indonesia. The indigenous people were persecuted during Indonesia’s 25-year occupation. During this time, many of uma lulik were destroyed or fell into disrepair. In 2002, when the country gained its independence, a resurgence of traditional customs emerged and these sacred homes began appear again. Uma lulik are usually built with local timber, bamboo and twine. Yet, each and every element transcends its physical properties and is charged with symbolism. This mingling of physicality and spirituality is extended to the way each element of the uma lulik is bound together with others to form something higher than itself. The structures are a connection between past and present, those here and those who have gone. Uma Lulik can be found in villages throughout Timor-Leste.

The lake is a self-contained body of water that sits in a depression in the land. The northern shore offers great views of the lake with the mountains and lush forest in the background and the grassland is littered with water buffaloes wallowing in their swimming holes. Bucolic as this might be, it’s the swamps on the southern shore that set this lake apart from the others. The landscape provides vistas of half-drowned trees that reach back like a haunting bayou. While the lake and its surrounds are teeming with all manner of life swimming among the underwater trunks it is the massive population of Estuarine crocodiles that distinguish the lake. It is thought that over 300 of the beasts are packed into the relatively small area. One of the reasons that the animals have nearly taken over the natural landmark is that the native tribe consider the crocs to be sacred totem animals that are not to be hunted. Swamps and crocs are usually associated with the American Southeast but this lake gives the traditional bayou a run for its money. The strangely lovely landscapes of Lake Ira Lalaro may be alluring but they also pack quite the bite.  About half-way between Fuiloro and Tutuala, Ira Lalaro (a lake) can be seen in the distance from the main road on the right hand side.

The building was one of seven schools built in the late 1920s and early 1930s in what was then the Portuguese colony of Timor, now Timor-Leste (East Timor). While others have been restored and preserved, the Escola do Reino de Haudere was severely damaged during World War II, and fell into disuse after the war. Abandoned for decades, what is left of the ruin is now overgrown with vegetation. This large and enigmatic ruin now greets travelers heading to Baguia, a remote village on the eastern slope of Matebian, the second-tallest mountain in the country.

82,Venilale Tunnels,"Venilale, East Timor",These underground shelters dug by the Japanese during World War II later helped East Timor achieve its independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/venilale-tunnels,"Venilale is a sleepy town in inland East Timor known for its cool weather, comparatively speaking. In its colonial past, this town was a prime destination for Portuguese settlers wishing to escape the heat. At the outskirts of Venilale are a set of tunnels that are steeped in World War II history, from when the eastern part of Timor was controlled by Portugal, and the western part by the Dutch. In 1942, Australia deployed troops on the island as a response to the attack on Pearl Harbor. This was designed as a precautionary move, not really expecting Japan to launch a full-on attack on Timor. But East Timor was particularly vulnerable, as the Portuguese were counting on their declaration of neutrality as a deterrent against Japan. (In hindsight, this was an obvious miscalculation.) When Japan attacked, it did so with an unexpected intensity and number of troops. Those Australian and Dutch troops that managed to survive were forced to retreat to the harsh and mountainous interior of East Timor to join another renegade Australian contingent. Timorese people either joined the fighters or supported them by other means, and from here, guerrilla warfare was waged against the Japanese occupation. During the six months that it took Japan to gain control of the island, Japanese forces had to venture farther and farther inland, and Venilale became a Japanese stronghold. It was at this time that a set of tunnels was dug out to be used as shelters. The story may have ended here, but it didn’t. Fast-forward events to 1974, when the Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente (commonly referred to as FRETILIN) was founded. East Timor was still Portuguese territory, and FRETILIN was a pro-independence movement whose members were freedom fighters that adopted the guerrilla warfare approach to gain independence for East Timor. In 1975, soon after East Timor gained independence from the Portuguese, Indonesian forces invaded it, and in their struggle against the Indonesian forces, FRETILIN fighters also used the Venilale tunnels as hideouts. The tunnels that were once a reminder of a long and bloody occupation became instrumental to the achievement of the country’s independence. On a side note, Timor-Leste and East Timor are synonymous, but Timor-Leste is the name used by Timorese people. Timor means East in Tetum, the local language, and Leste means East in Portuguese. Basically, whether you use the local or the English forms, the name is still “East-East.”  Venilale is 30 km south of Baucau, the most sizeable settlement in the area. Public transport is sporadic. The best way to reach Venilale is by your own transport. The road is bumpy and many sections are not paved, but a regular car or motorbike can manage easily.

Home to thousands of birds, Sia Maubara doubles as a bird watcher’s paradise and historical place. It is all but impossible to visit the lake without sighting Australian Pelicans and numerous other species of birds that call the reserve home. Other birds frequenting the lake include Black Cuckoo-doves, Pink-headed Imperial Pigeons, Jonquil Parrots, Streak-breasted Honeyeaters, and Flame-breasted Sunbirds. Beyond bird watching, Sia Maubara has a tragic history. During the Timor-Leste war for independence, pro-Indonesia elements (including Indonesian soldiers) murdered up to 200 Timorese people in what became known as the Liquiçá Church Massacre. It was said that one way in which the bodies were disposed of was to sink them in Sia Maubara.  The suspicion was eventually confirmed when Australian Marine Divers recovered corpses of twelve victims from Sia Maubara. Despite its violent past, Sia Maubara is a place of unsettling beauty where bright blue water and soil cracked by the heat meet. Dead trees bleached by the sun are scattered along the shore, giving the lake an eerie ambiance that is reminiscent of the lake’s macabre past. Adding to the unease, you may not be the only visitor, as crocodiles may be visiting the lake too.  Coming from Liquiçá, Sia Maubara is located 3 km from Maubara Village.

Among the motifs portrayed in these caves are boats, animals, birds, people, the Sun, stars, geometric patterns, and figures featuring a mixture of human and animal traits. The first caves within the park were explored and studied in 1966. The last nine caves were explored and studied for the first time in 2000. Considering the thick vegetation and rugged terrain, it would not be unfathomable to speculate that more rock art is yet to be found. Carbon dating tests run on human-made findings from the Lene Hara cave show that humans have been living in this region for at least 30,000 years. The dating of the paintings, however, has proven to be more controversial. Some scholars initially claimed that the paintings date back to the Neolithic Age (about 12,000 years ago), but this view has been challenged by more recent research that suggests these images are from as recent as 2,500 years ago. These rock paintings exhibit techniques, styles, and motifs also present on other islands in the South Pacific, including Australia. Techniques and styles can travel a long way, adapting to specific and diverse cultural contexts. Yet, the similarities in motifs suggest that in spite of the significant distance among them, these islands may have shared the same symbolic system. If this is the case, these societies must have had more interchanges with one another than previously thought.  The rock art sites are located on the island's easternmost tip, within the boundaries of Nino Konis Santana National Park. Some can be found near the dirt track leading from Tutuala to Waloo beach, while others are located deeper in the forest. The most commonly known of these sites are Ile Kere Kere, Lene Hara, and Jerimalai. For the caves near Tutuala, you can ask people for directions. They are near the dirt track to Waloo beach, and the path leading to these sites is clear.

85,Cristo Rei,"Dili, East Timor",This giant Christ statue was a failed attempt by Indonesia to dissuade East Timor from demanding independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cristo-rei,"East Timor is the one of the most Christian countries in the world, with 99.1% of the population subscribing to the faith. Meanwhile its neighbor next door, Indonesia, is the most populous Muslim country on Earth. While this religious intermingling has caused a few incidences of violence over the years, it also begat a compassionate yet awkward gift exchange. This 89-foot statue of Cristo Rei was constructed in 1996 as a present from Indonesia to East Timor. Indonesian President Suharto wanted to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Indonesia invasion and annexation of East Timor by half-apologizing to the East Timorese people for Indonesia’s decades of occupation. To please the Catholic majority, Suharto, a Muslim, built a giant statue of Jesus standing atop a globe, accessible by a 590-step staircase. The statue was built in the Indonesian city of Bandung, where nearly all of the workers carving the face of Jesus into copper were Muslim. Despite three months of construction and a cost of 5 billion rupiah ($559,000), the Indonesian government failed to appease the majority of East Timorese people. Part of the reasoning for this is that Suharto angled the statue to be facing the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, which caused controversy among the Timorese. The ploy had little effect on staving off the East Timorese independence movement, which the people voted overwhelmingly for in 1999 and ultimately won in 2002.

The Dutch and the British managed to take power for short spells of time in subsequent centuries, but the Portuguese managed to win the colony back. It was not until 1975 that East Timor became independent. After two decades of violent struggle with neighboring Indonesia, East Timor finally formalized its status as an independent country in 2002. In effect, the Portuguese ruled over East Timor for about 500 years, and they mainly relied on Indigenous semi-autonomous governance. They did, however, build a number of military forts for the protection of the territory. Several forts were built throughout East Timor, but very few remains can be found, partly due to the fact that they were usually built with locally found rocks neatly arranged to form a wall and held together by a mineral adhesive that eventually lost its binding properties. One of the most scenic of these forts is in the Southern village of Suai Loro, which also used to serve as the administrative headquarters and prison. Located along the beach, the few walls remaining of this structure are now being reclaimed by a banyan tree. There is no guardian, and no entry fee, but do keep an eye out for crocodiles.

Its individual units are stacked one on top of the other and create a colorful, cohesive tapestry of homes. Quarry Bay is a densely packed neighborhood in Eastern Hong Kong, with more and more industrial and residential spaces opening each year, but perhaps no building is quite as condensed as the “Monster Building.” The Monster Building, as it’s been nicknamed by locals, isn’t actually a single building, but an E-shaped complex composed of five connecting structures: Oceanic Mansion, Fook Cheong Building, Montane Mansion, Yick Cheong Building, and Yick Fat Building. They were built during a population boom in the 1960s to offer government-subsidized housing for low-income residents. The compound has a similar look to other subsidized housing built in the same decade, when the upper floors of the building were used as residences and the lower floors were used for shops selling tea, fish, and other groceries and household goods. Because of its photo-friendly symmetry and aesthetically striking architecture, the building has become a favorite spot for urban explorers and Instagrammers. The area has been used as a set in multiple films, including Ghost in the Shell and Transformers.

The sprawling building is composed of five residential towers built in 1961 in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. Aside from headquartering illicit prostitution rings and drug traders, the building’s labyrinthine structure and minimal upkeep have led to a reputation for the cheapest accommodations in Hong Kong, giving the twisting building a legendary status among fearless backpackers. While the 17-floor towers have nearly 2,000 guest-rooms housing nearly 4,000 people nightly, the “Chungking Express” mall on the first two floors remains the main attraction for passerby. After undergoing a massive facelift in the early 2000s, the mall reopened in 2004 with more than 500 stores and restaurants. From curry restaurants to African bistros to black market phone smugglers, the ground floor is a non-stop carnival of shopping and scheming. Despite the recent overhaul of the mall, the building’s residential towers maintain their reputation as a dangerous fire trap due to unsanitary conditions, antique electrical wiring, and blocked stairwells. Even with all of the activities that would rather not be in the spotlight, the building gained a foothold in popular culture via the 1994 drama film Chungking Express and has intrigued academics since the 2011 publication of the book, Ghetto at the Center of the World. Chinese University of Hong Kong anthropology professor Gordon Mathews published the book after spending more than 4 years in the Mansions documenting its residents and operations. Mathews estimated more than 120 different nationalities pass through the Mansions each year along with up to 20% of the active cell phones in sub-Saharan Africa having passed also through the building. All of the academic and high-art representations aside, the most accurate description of the Chungking Mansions comes from The Economist’s 2011 analogy which equated the towering den of vice to the Mos Eisley Cantina, the fictional intergalactic pirate haunt from Star Wars.

Occupying every inch of hundreds of mid-rise buildings, Kowloon was such a lawless maze of alleyways and secret staircases, that police from the outside world would rarely venture in without a sizable group. There were two main alleys on the ground as well, but they did not get any natural light, instead the city had neon lights that were working 24 hours a day. When it was first built, Kowloon was a military base with walls 13 feet high and 15 feet thick. During the 19th and early 20th century, it traded hands a number of times until after World War II when the Chinese made an attempt to reclaim their rights to the city. Before they could get control, an influx of immigrants occupied Kowloon, making its regulation and governance impossible by the Chinese authorities, as well as the British administration in Hong Kong. Over the next 50 years, Kowloon grew at an enormous rate, swelling the 6.5 acre site to an overpopulated box of anarchy. As more immigrants moved into the city, ten-storey buildings were erected across most of the city, effectively blocking out the sunlight in the alleyways below. Kowloon was so dense and so tightly packed with buildings that one could go across the city North to South on a series of interconnected stairways and paths without touching the ground. As Kowloon became more of a hazardous maze, outside authority in the area dwindled and Triad gangs moved into position. During the late 1950s and 1960s, drugs, prostitution and gang influence reached an apex, and Hong Kong police found themselves unable to gain control over the city-state. In 1973, an attempt to clean up the area resulted in the seizure of 4,000 pounds of drugs, or 1/10 of a pound of illegal substances per person. The city was also home to many small businesses that functioned without licenses, namely 87 dentists, 150 small shops and over 60 doctors. After years of lawlessness, the decrepit city was slated for demolition in 1987, and 6 years later when the eviction process ended, the city was razed. Despite losing most of the remnants of the old city, the southern gate and administrative Yamen building remained intact. Today, Kowloon is a city park, and visitors can stroll the same ground that once held opium dens, triad bars and thousands of people.",cultures and civilizations outsider architecture architectural oddities architecture
92,A Sky Full of Gods and Buddhas,Hong Kong,Thousands of abandoned statues of deities are taken to this hillside in southern Hong Kong.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/a-sky-full-of-gods-and-buddhas,"At the bottom of the stairs in Waterfall Bay Park in the southern part of the Wah Fu district of Hong Kong is a hillside where people bring household deities they can no longer keep. Wong Wing-pong looks after this collection of statues, their self-appointed caretaker for nearly two decades in his retirement. The octogenarian was once a butcher, but now every day he comes to the rocky slope full of statues of Buddha and gods from many religions, though mostly Buddhism and Taoism, where he sweeps away leaves and burns incense as an offering. Wong first came upon this spot on a walk, at a time when it already had around a dozen statues. Since then, he has regularly added to the collection, which has come to be known locally as “a sky full of gods and Buddhas.” In Hong Kong, it is against the beliefs of most residents to dispose of a statue of Buddha or a deity, even if it is broken, so they leave them by the side of the road for someone else either to take or to worship. Wong picks up discarded statues he finds, fixes them if they need fixing, and brings them to this spot. It has become so well known that he doesn’t have to do that as much anymore because people bring their statues directly to him. All of the statues look out to sea. People often visit the collection, which now numbers in the thousands, to worship, whether they have statues that have been incorporated into it or not. This is not the only such shrine around Hong Kong, but it is by far the biggest. The only thing the local government asks is that the statues not block footpaths.",hong kong religious parks recycling buddhism religion collections sacred spaces statues

Although its size is average compared to some of the world’s most massive Buddhas, the Tian Tan Buddha holds the distinction of being the largest seated bronze Buddha in the world. Ignoring its size completely, the statue seems more impressive due to its location, in a valley surrounded by densely forested peaks. At 112 feet (34 meters) high, the Buddha can even be seen through the mountains from nearby Macau on a clear day. With eyes closed and right hand raised, the Buddha’s calm and wise appearance seems to control the energy of the valley. The Buddha was constructed between 1990-1993. Adventure-seekers climb the 268 steps to the Buddha’s feet, but the monastery does not discriminate; a ramped path makes the trip up to Buddha’s pedestal accessible for families and the handicapped. The path to the Big Buddha is lined on both sides by the Twelve Divine Generals, each of them symbolizing a different animal from the Chinese Zodiac. Every General is armed with a specific weapon and represents two hours of the day, thus, together they add up to 24 hours. Although access to the site is free, entrance to the Buddha costs money. The inside of the Buddha allegedly holds the cremated remains of the Buddha inside a relic, but even a quick view is going to cost you.

Its continued survival can be partly attributed to the famed Wishing Trees, located in Tin Hau Temple, which is said to grant any wish that can get caught in their branches. Tin Hau Temple dates back to the late 1700s when it was constructed during the Qing dynasty. One of the nearby trees, a camphor, was said to be able to grant wishes. Thus was the tradition started that has drawn locals and visitors to the supposedly enchanted plants for hundreds of years. Initially, visitors would write their desires on small joss paper scrolls (a parchment specifically used for offerings) and then tie them onto branches or throw them into the tree. The higher the wish got stuck, the better chance it had to come true—but if it fell out, it was not to be. In more modern times, this practice has been transferred to a 200-year old banyan tree. When a couple of large branches, weighed down by too many wishes, broke off and actually injured bystanders, the local government stepped in and outlawed the placing of wishes on the tree. To provide an outlet for everyone’s desire for wish fulfillment, a wooden rack was constructed near the original tree and a whole other fake plastic wishing tree was even built. In 2008, a smaller banyan was planted a few meters from the original banyan version of the tree so that the growing wish tree line would not die out—although casting wishes into the new tree are also outlawed. Most people now make their wishes on the colorful plastic tree in Lam Tsuen, although the wish-granting efficacy of this replacement is not known.",wishing trees magic mythology trees plants

According to legend, when Cheng I died, Cheng Po took up with his adoptive mother and married her, carrying on the family business of pillage and plunder. At his height of infamy he is said to have commanded a fearsome pirate fleet of 600 ships and a veritable pirate army of 20,000 men. Then, in 1810 his career took an unexpected turn when he surrendered to the government and accepted a post as navy colonel and an assignment far from his home waters off Hong Kong, patrolling instead the coast of Taiwan. Cheng Po is said to have squirreled his pirate treasure on Cheng Chau island 6 miles off the coast of Hong Kong. Visitors can follow in his footsteps and climb down into a small cave near the coast and look for themselves, but no treasure has ever been found.

97,Central-Mid-Levels Escalators,Hong Kong,The world's longest outdoor covered escalator system transports commuters through Hong Kong's hilly terrain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-mid-levels-escalators,"For most city-dwellers, the daily commute is characterized by congested streets, packed subway cars, or perilous bike rides. But for many commuters traveling between Hong Kong’s Central and Mid-levels districts, the trip to and from work can be as easy as standing in place and holding the handrail while roughly a mile’s worth of covered escalators and moving sidewalks moves them through the surrounding hills. Plans for the Central-Mid-Levels escalator system were proposed in 1987 as a means of transporting a growing population through the island’s challenging slopes. Prior to the project’s completion in 1993, commuters were obliged to take a circuitous route consisting of several miles of zigzagging roads in order to travel between the two districts. The Central-Mid-Levels escalators introduced a pedestrian option that was much more direct. It takes roughly 20 minutes to cover the entire length of the network, which at times weaves its way through residential blocks as well as more commercial areas. Most commuters shorten the trip by walking some or all of the way while the escalators are in motion. The escalators also provide a free, leisurely option for tourists looking to explore the area. Numerous entrances offer ample opportunities to enter and exit in order to investigate nearby restaurants, markets, and shops. Visitors should keep in mind that the system runs in one direction only — downhill during the morning rush hour and uphill from 10:30 am to midnight.

98,Wong Tai Sin Temple,Hong Kong,"Taoism, Buddhist and Confucianism are all represented in this temple that claims to answer anyone's wishes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wong-tai-sin-temple,"Wong Tai Sin Temple is known for answering prayers and wishes with the practice of Kau Cim, a form of fortune telling that originated in China. The beautifully ornamented temple is dedicated to the Taoist deity, Wong Tai Sin, a shepherd boy born in Zhejiang Province on the eastern coast of mainland China in the 4th century. According to legend he began practising Taoism at the age of 15 after meeting an immortal on Heng Shan (Red Pine Hill) in his hometown. The saintly person taught him the art of refining cinnabar into a medicine believed to cure all illnesses. After spending 40 years in seclusion learning this art, he achieved enlightenment and became immortal. Legend holds that Wong Tai Sin could punish the evil, heal the wounded, rescue the dying, see the future, and make wishes come true. Originally a private shrine for Taoists, in 1934 the Wong Tai Sin temple was opened to the public for the Lunar New Year. The temple survived the wide destruction of Hong Kong during the Japanese Occupation in WWII, which was attributed to Wong Tai Sin’s powers. In 1956, with government approval, the shrine was opened to the public year-round. The huge shrine includes many halls and altars, and though it is primarily a Taoist temple, the shrine also has Buddhist and Confucian worshipping halls. A portrait of Wong Tai Sin stands in the middle of the Main Altar backdropped by wooden sculptures that depict the story of how Wong Tai Sin became a deity. Taoist as well as Buddhist and Confucian scriptures and images are engraved on the walls. The large open space in front of the Main Altar is the main worshipping place. Here worshippers hold bundles of burning incense and bow to Wong Tai Sin three times and then shake fortune sticks until one falls out. The stick is exchanged for a piece of paper with the corresponding number for interpretation by the fortune tellers. The secondary platform contains bronze statues of the 12 Zodiac Animals. Another interesting feature are the five buildings and structures, arranged in a row, representing the five elements in fung shui: the Bronze Pavilion (metal); the Archives Hall (wood); the Yuk Yik Fountain (water); the Yue Hung Shrine (fire), where the Buddha of the Lighting Lamp is worshipped; and the Earth Wall (earth). Located at the rear of the complex is Good Wish Garden, Chinese-style garden which features a miniature replica of the Summer Palace in Beijing, the replica of the Nine Dragon mural in Pei Hai Park in the Forbidden City in Beijing, and a white jade statue of sheep, depicting the miracle of Wong Tai Sin transforming piles of white boulders into sheep.",temples religion sacred spaces
99,Noonday Gun,Hong Kong,"This naval gun is fired every day at noon, an odd timekeeping tradition the origin of which is local legend.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/noonday-gun,"Situated on a small enclosed site in the waterfront district of Causeway Bay, the Noonday Gun is a Hotchkiss three-pound artillery piece that is ceremonially fired every day at (appropriately enough) noon on the dot. While this practice is somewhat charming in its own right, the details behind the practice—such as the owner of the gun, and the purported genesis of the tradition—provide striking insight into Hong Kong’s British colonial history. The gun is owned by Jardine Matheson, a massive British conglomerate that was one of the first trading houses, or “hongs,” in Hong Kong. The land that is now Causeway Bay was bought by Jardine Matheson in 1841, and was in fact the first piece of Hong Kong sold at public auction by the eager new colonial government. With its roots in Imperial China, Jardine Matheson was involved in shipping tea and cotton, but also made a great deal of money from the illegal opium trade. They built the company’s main offices and warehouses—known locally as godowns—on the newly acquired plot. The Noonday Gun has its roots in a 21-pound gun that Jardine Matheson set up on the waterfront of their commercial fiefdom. According to the commonly related story, the company’s private militia would fire the gun in salute whenever the head of the company (or, in some versions, whenever one of the company’s ships) sailed into or out of the harbor. In 1860, a senior officer of the Royal Navy, new to town and unfamiliar with the practice, found this offensive, as typically only government dignitaries or military officers receive such treatment. As a reprimand, Jardine Matheson was ordered to henceforth fire the gun every day at noon, providing a service in the form of a public time signal. The probable kernel of truth in this story is the gun’s role as a public time signal. This was a common practice in many harbors in the 19th century, allowing all ships within auditory range to correctly calibrate their onboard clocks, which they used on voyages to calculate longitude. Thus, the Noonday Gun is most likely a practical measure that became so common to daily harbor life that it morphed over time into local tradition. The original gun was dismantled by the occupying Japanese Imperial Army in 1941. A new gun was donated by the Royal Navy after Hong Kong  was liberated in 1945; this gun (humorously enough) received noise complaints, and was replaced by the current, smaller gun in 1947. This gun has a history of its own, having seen action in the Battle of Jutland during the First World War. The Noonday Gun was immortalised in the popular (and cartoonishly racist) song “Mad Dogs and Englishmen” written by Noel Coward. The song was first performed by Beatrice Lillie in a musical revue called The Third Little Show at the Music Box Theatre in New York, on June 1, 1931. In 1968, Coward visited Hong Kong and was allowed to fire the gun that he made famous with the lines, “In Hong Kong, they strike a gong, and fire off a Noonday Gun / To reprimand each inmate who’s in late,” going on to observe, “But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun!”",sailors naval history time ships colonialism

During the late 1990s, the Hong Kong government planned to construct a sprawling suspension bridge connecting the bustling city to a new airport across the Rambler Channel. Complicating matters, however, was an undeveloped island which would be roofed by the new bridge. Miraculously, a unique three-way partnership between the Hong Kong government, a pair of billionaire developer brothers, and a group of Christian organizations emerged with a plan to cover the island with a “remarkable” theme park. The proposed visions for this theme park ranged from the outrageous to the unreasonable before government officials received a design for a massive ark overlooking the water, a design which was scrawled by an eight-year-old Hong Kong girl. The recreated Noah’s Ark was built precisely to the biblical dimensions with a length of 300 cubits (450 feet), and the park markets itself as a creationist and family-centric vacation destination. Though the majority of this theme park’s distinctive attraction is the menagerie of 67 fiberglass animal couples, the theme park houses a wide breadth of activities and exhibits from a solar observatory telescope tower to a seaside café. The attraction encompasses areas such as the outdoor Nature Garden featuring live, rare animal species, an indoor jungle gym with swings and climbing areas called Noah’s Adventureland, and a resort on the top floor for lodging and dining. The park’s management unabashedly and hyperbolically promotes the ark as a refuge for visitors that may be in the midst of their own personal “floods.”",amusement parks roadside attractions shops monuments architectural oddities architecture

By the time the sun rises, the place is packed with customers ranging from elderly people sipping tea to students from the nearby university and still-tipsy revelers seeking late-night bites. Opened by Chui Hoi in 1972 and now run by his son, Sun Hing has become something of an institution—one well-worth either getting up or staying up for. While mass-production has crept into many of the city’s pricier dim sum halls, cooks here still prepare everything from scratch, from dainty quail’s egg siu mai to salted egg lava buns with a yolk custard that tastes like warm cake batter. Unlike modern dim sum restaurants, where diners normally check off the items on a paper menu, patrons at Sun Hing can still select their dishes from roving trolley carts. A server marks the table’s card with the corresponding numbers of selected dim sum, then tallies up the bill at the end. Tea is self-service, with a selection of loose-leaf options—including black tea, tie guan yin (Iron Buddha), and pu-erh—perched on a stainless-steel shelf. Diners can also watch cooks in the open kitchen rolling and flattening dough or skillfully folding dumpling wrappers into half-moon shapes. Servers continually call out fresh arrivals and it’s up to patrons to pounce on each new batch of dim sum before another table scoops it up.  Sharing a table with strangers is quite common at dim sum parlors.

It represents the traditional social organisation and religious practices of the Chinese community in old Hong Kong. The complex, built between 1847 and 1862, during the Qing dynasty by wealthy Chinese merchants, comprises of three parts: Man Mo Temple, Lit Shing Kung and Kung So. Man Mo Temple is dedicated to two deities, the God of Literature (Man Tai), holding a writing brush, and the God of Martial Arts (Mo Tai), having a sword. Both of them were worshipped by ambitious scholars and students seeking progress in their study or high ranking in the civil examinations of Imperial China. Lit Shing Kung was built for the worship of all the Chinese heavenly gods. Whereas, Kung So was an important assembly hall where community affairs and disputes could be discussed and settled. The complex is a fine example of traditional Chinese architecture and craftsmanship. The temple’s most memorable features are the rows of large red-coloured incense spirals suspended from the ceiling which are burned as offerings by worshippers. They take a couple of weeks to burn through. It provides a serene space in contrast with the hectic pace of the nearby financial district. The temple is also featured in a video game, Shenmue II for the Dreamcast and Xbox consoles. The temple and its grounds can be explored in the game.

Built to combat the rampant piracy and smuggling from the surrounding waters, the Tai O Police Station also aimed to instill British law and order throughout the entire island. One of the first police stations built on the outlying islands around Hong Kong, the building consists of two blocks of two stories, linked by a footbridge on the first level. Marked by its amalgam of architectural styles, the building includes arched verandas of the Italian Renaissance, a Chinese pan-and-roll roof, and elements of the Arts and Crafts style. Originally the station was staffed with fewer than ten policemen, and the building increasingly served as an administrative center, peaking with 180 employees in 1983. The low crime rate in the 400 year-old fishing village led to a demoted status as a patrol post in 1996, a role maintained until the station’s closing in 2002. Looking to revitalize a historic building, the Hong Kong government accepted a 2009 developer proposal to convert the station into a seaside lodge. Finished in 2012, the Tai O Heritage Hotel includes nine colonial-style rooms and ocean-view suites and even new roof-top restaurant.

In 1990, the Bank of China Tower was built next door, and it’s now one of the most recognizable skyscrapers of Hong Kong. But the iconic tower’s unique shape came at a curious price: Feng shui principles were ignored. In fact, the Bank of China Tower is the only major building in Hong Kong that doesn’t follow the 3,000-year-old Chinese practice of feng shui, the belief that the energy of your environment affects well-being and prosperity. The HSBC Building was designed to have excellent feng shui. It is positioned with a clear view of the harbor, as water is associated with prosperity; the ground floor is an open atrium where wind and positive qi can flow; and the escalators were built at an angle because evil spirits can only travel in a straight line. The negative energy of the Bank of China Tower’s architecture, on the other hand, created some controversy. The pointed shapes of the tower look like sharp, knife-like edges, one pointing at the British Government House, and one pointing at the HSBC Building. The British Government House saw various misfortunes in the years following the tower’s construction, as one governor lost his job, and his successor had a heart attack, and the entire city suffered during an economic downturn. In order to defend against the bad luck of the Bank of China Tower’s design, two maintenance cranes in the shape of cannons pointing towards the tower were installed on top of the HSBC Building.

108,Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter,Hong Kong,A small subculture of boat dwellers keep their traditional way of living alive at this Hong Kong Typhoon Shelter.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/causeway-bay-typhoon-shelter,"In the middle of the fleet of luxury yachts a distinct subculture still survives: a small group of boat dwellers living at the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter. The Tanka (boat dwellers) were among the early ethic subgroups of Hong Kong, The origins of the Tanka are uncertain, but it is generally accepted that they were indigenous people of Southern China who began dwelling on boats in coastal waters, because of their displacement by the invading Han from the north from 221 BC onwards, during the Qin Dynasty. The term Tanka is now considered derogatory and no longer is in common use. The boat dwellers were considered to be outcasts and they were despised by the land-dwelling Han. Later on, since they were boat dwellers who lived by the sea, they were sometimes referred to as “sea gypsies” by the Chinese and British. Though many now live onshore, some from the older generations still live on their narrow boats and keep alive their traditional way of living. Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter was the first typhoon shelter in Hong Kong. The original typhoon shelter was built after the 1874 typhoon, at the present location of Victoria Park, to provide shelter for fishing boats during storms. It was completed in 1883 with a breakwater only 427 metres. On September 18, 1906, a typhoon struck Hong Kong, destroying 3,653 boats and killing 15,000 people, most of them fishermen. Consequently, in March 1908 the Government carried out expansion works on the typhoon shelter, deepening it by 3 metres (9 feet). In 1953 the typhoon shelter was moved northwards to its present site and the original typhoon shelter was reclaimed to provide land for Victoria Park. Four decades ago, there were almost 40,000 people living on boats in the typhoon shelter, creating a thriving and distinct subculture. Today, there are only about 30 residents tacked away amidst luxury yachts. Many of them have homes on land as well. They make living by transporting people from the shore to their yachts, by taking passengers for a trip around Victoria Harbour or by providing “typhoon shelter cuisine.” One of the ships is a grocery store that provides supplies to the floating community. Also, moored at the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter is a floating temple dedicated to the goddess Tin Hau, the Chinese patron goddess protecting seafarers, docked at its current location since 1955. The temple houses a statue of her that was fished from the sea. Update January, 2017: This is no longer there as of December 2016.

At the edge of the Thar desert, the area sees torrential seasonal monsoons, and then watches the water disappear almost immediately. With summers routinely over 100 degrees, and silty soil that would not hold water in ponds, a practical solution was needed for locals and travelers along the local trade routes. In the first century, the slippery shores of the major rivers were tamed by the construction of ghats, long, shallow sets of stairs and landings. The same approach was applied to the construction of a new kind of well. The earliest stepwells most likely date to about 550, but the most famous were built in medieval times. It is estimated that over 3,000 stepwells were built in the two northern states. Although many have fallen into disrepair, were silted in at some point in antiquity, or were filled in with trash in the modern era, hundreds of wells still exist. In New Delhi alone, there are more than 30. Chand Baori in Abhaneri, near Jaipur, Rajasthan, is among the largest, if not the largest, of the stepwells. It is also perhaps the most visually spectacular: Chand Baori is a deep four-sided structure with an immense temple on one face. Some 3,500 Escher-esqe terraced steps march down the other three sides 13 stories to a depth of 100 feet. The construction dates to the 10th century, and is dedicated to Harshat Mata, goddess of joy and happiness. Water plays a special part in Hindu cosmology, as a boundary between heaven and earth known as tirtha. As manmade tirtha, the stepwells became not only sources of drinking water, but cool sanctuaries for bathing, prayer, and meditation. The wells are called by many names. In Hindi they are baori, baoli, baudi, bawdi, or bavadi. In Gujarati, spoken in Gujarat, they are commonly called vav. The architecture of the wells varies by type and by location, and when they were built. Two common types are a step pond, with a large open top and graduated sides meeting at a relatively shallow depth. The stepwell type usually incorporates a narrow shaft, protected from direct sunlight by a full or partial roof, ending in a deeper, rounded well-end. Temples and resting areas with beautiful carvings are built into many of the wells. In their prime, many of them were painted in bright colors of lime-based paint, and now traces of ancient colors cling to dark corners. The use and conditions of stepwells began to decline in the years of the British Raj, who were horrified by the unsanitary conditions of these drinking water bathing spots. They began to install pumps and pipes, and eventually outlawed the use of stepwells in some places. The remaining stepwells are in varying states of preservation, and some have gone dry. Local kids seem to find the ones with water to be terrific diving spots, which seems insanely hazardous.",stepwells long now locations wells ruins architectural oddities architecture

Known as Hawa Mahal in Hindi, the Palace of the Winds was constructed in 1799 for Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh as part of the women’s section of the enormous City Palace at the center of Jaipur. The facade we see from the street is essentially an enormous screened porch, one room deep in most places. The palace’s distinctive rosy color comes from the natural sandstone from which it is built which also gives Jaipur its nickname, “The Pink City.” The Palace of the Winds is considered one of the finest examples of Rajput architecture in India.",palaces architectural oddities architecture
111,The Root Bridges of Cherrapunji,"Cherrapunjee, India",Centuries-old bridges grown from tangled roots.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/root-bridges-cherrapungee,"In the depths of northeastern India, within sight of the India-Bangladesh border, in one of the wettest places on earth, bridges aren’t built—they’re grown. The southern Khasi and Jaintia hills are humid and warm, crisscrossed by swift-flowing rivers and mountain streams. On the slopes of these hills, a species of Indian rubber tree with an incredibly strong root system thrives and flourishes. The Ficus elastica produces a series of secondary roots from higher up its trunk and can comfortably perch atop huge boulders along the riverbanks, or even in the middle of the rivers themselves. The War-Khasis and War-Jaintias, two closely related tribes in Meghalaya, long ago noticed this tree and saw in its powerful roots an opportunity to easily cross the area’s many rivers. Now, whenever and wherever the need arises, they simply grow their bridges. In order to make a rubber tree’s roots grow in the right direction—say, over a river—the people of southern Meghalaya have used several different strategies. Sometimes, the roots of the trees are simply pulled, tied, twisted, and encouraged by hand to merge with each other, until, over time, they form the desired architectural structure. Root bridges have also been made by creating scaffolds out of wood and bamboo, and then training the young roots out across these temporary structures, replacing the more perishable elements many times as they rot in the intense monsoon seasons. In some places, such as around the village of Nongriat, betel nut trunks, sliced down the middle and hollowed out, are used to create root-guidance systems. The thin, tender roots of the rubber tree, prevented from fanning out by the betel nut trunks, grow straight out. The trunks also have the added advantage of providing the roots with additional nutrients as they decay. When they reach the other side of the river, they’re allowed to take root in the soil. Given enough time a sturdy, living bridge is produced. The root bridges can grow for as long as the organism they are a part of remains healthy, though they can take many years to initially become functional, the length of time being dependent on local conditions such as the health of the tree, the way the bridge is being grown, and the availability of nutrients in the soil that its being grown in. However, once root bridges become established, they’re extraordinarily strong—strong enough that some of them can support the weight of 50 or more people at a time. In fact, because they are alive and still growing, the bridges actually gain strength over time—and some of the ancient root bridges used daily by the people of the villages around Cherrapunji may be well over 500 years old. The roots bridges of southern Meghalaya come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They have been known to grow as long as 170 feet, and soar 80 feet above the streams they cross. Most living root bridges only have a single span, yet several have more than one, arranged as either as two parallel spans,  or as two bridges stacked one over the other, such as the famous “Umshiang Double-Decker Root Bridge.” The practice of creating new living bridges, and of preserving ones already in existence, is over large parts of Southern Meghalaya slowly fading out. In many villages across the region, the root bridges are little more than a memory.  However, since they began attracting attention again in around 2004, local dedication to the bridges has, at least in a few places, kept them from being destroyed in favor of steel ones. What’s more, a few new root bridges are currently under construction. In the village of Rangthylliang, an entirely new bridge is being grown using a bamboo and wood scaffold, and at the double-decker site in Nongriat, a new, third span is currently being grown above the other two, and should be ready for use within a decade. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Root Bridges of Cherrapunji.  While there are dozens of root bridges, which can be found all throughout the valleys between (very roughly!) the towns of Mawsynram and Dawki, few of these are easily accessible, or have nearby tourist facilities. To visit the bridges in the more remote areas, a local guide is an absolute must! A number of these bridges can be reached from Cherrapunjee Holiday Resort. Local maps to the bridges are available from the Resort. The ""Umshiang Double-Decker Root Bridge"" is located in the village of Nongriat. Visitors can walk here from the small village of Tyrna. The village is accessible from Cherrapunjee by shared or private taxi. From the village, 2500 steps must be traversed to reach Nongriat. The walk takes about 1.5 - 2 hours each way. Nongriat offers basic accommodation to visitors, so it's possible to stay overnight for a more relaxed experience. Serene Guest House is the best run establishment in Nongriat. From Nongriat, short hikes can lead you to several nearby root bridges, include several upstream from the village, a small, nice one, in the village of Mynteng, and several spectacular examples in the village of Nongthymmai. A large number of living root bridges are known to exist in the jungles around the town of Pynursla. To reach these, many of which are deep in the jungle and require several hours of tough hiking, make sure to find a reliable, local, guide. The Rangthylliang Eco-Tourism society comes highly recommended, and can arrange your stay while in the area. Another option for visiting root bridges is the beautiful, remote, village of Kongthong, which has several in the near vicinity. The Kongthong Travelers Nest is a great base to explore the area from, with several spectacular root bridges within a few hours walk. There's also the village of Shnongpdeng, in the West Jaintia Hills, near Dawki, which can be used as a great staging area to explore several villages with root bridges. Recommended are Kudeng Rim, Padu, and Burma. All of these villages have very little in the way of tourist facilities, so make sure to ask for help planning your visit in Shnongpdeng!

112,Skeletons of Roopkund Lake,"Chamoli, India",A lake with hundreds of ancient skeletons surrounding it. The surprise is what killed them.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skeleton-lake-of-roopkund-india,"In 1942 a British forest guard in Roopkund, India made an alarming discovery. Some 16,000 feet above sea level, at the bottom of a small valley, was a frozen lake absolutely full of skeletons. That summer, the ice melting revealed even more skeletal remains, floating in the water and lying haphazardly around the lake’s edges. Something horrible had happened here. The immediate assumption (it being war time) was that these were the remains of Japanese soldiers who had died of exposure while sneaking through India. The British government, terrified of a Japanese land invasion, sent a team of investigators to determine if this was true. However upon examination they realized these bones were not from Japanese soldiers—they weren’t fresh enough. It was evident that the bones were quite old indeed. Flesh, hair, and the bones themselves had been preserved by the dry, cold air, but no one could properly determine exactly when they were from. More than that, they had no idea what had killed over 200 people in this small valley. Many theories were put forth including an epidemic, landslide, and ritual suicide. For decades, no one was able to shed light on the mystery of Skeleton Lake. However, a 2004 expedition to the site seems to have finally revealed the mystery of what caused those people’s deaths. The answer was stranger than anyone had guessed. As it turns out, all the bodies date to around 850 AD. DNA evidence indicates that there were two distinct groups of people, one a family or tribe of closely related individuals, and a second smaller, shorter group of locals, likely hired as porters and guides. Rings, spears, leather shoes, and bamboo staves were found, leading experts to believe that the group was comprised of pilgrims heading through the valley with the help of the locals. All the bodies had died in a similar way, from blows to the head. However, the short deep cracks in the skulls appeared to be the result not of weapons, but rather of something rounded. The bodies also only had wounds on their heads, and shoulders as if the blows had all come from directly above. What had killed them all, porter and pilgrim alike? Among Himalayan women there is an ancient and traditional folk song. The lyrics describe a goddess so enraged at outsiders who defiled her mountain sanctuary that she rained death upon them by flinging hailstones “hard as iron.” After much research and consideration, the 2004 expedition came to the same conclusion. All 200 people died from a sudden and severe hailstorm. Trapped in the valley with nowhere to hide or seek shelter, the “hard as iron” cricket ball-sized [about 23 centimeter/9 inches circumference] hailstones came by the thousands, resulting in the travelers’ bizarre sudden death. The remains lay in the lake for 1,200 years until their discovery.  There are no roads to this place yet, so one has to undertake a 3-4 day trek to reach the skeleton lake starting from Gwaldum in Chamoli district. The skeleton lake is covered with ice for most of the time during the year.",weird weather phenomena relics and reliquaries disaster areas memento mori intriguing environs natural wonders ecosystems water nature

Although the name translates to “Water Palace,” the building was never intended to be a palace, as such, but was instead conceived as a hunting lodge for the local Raja (King). In the 16th-century, a severe drought spurred the locals to create a dam, creating the lake that submerged the lower portions of the lodge. During the 18th century, the water-locked lodge was renovated and the lake area was expanded. For a great deal of the temple’s history, visitors were able to take gondolas across the lake waters to visit the historic faux-palace. The rooftop of the structure manages to support foliage and from the shoreline it almost looks like the castle is still in use. Today the building is inaccessible to tourists, although plans are afoot to convert it into a restaurant.

114,Ellora Caves,"Verul, India","This complex of vertically-excavated Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu monolithic temples in India's Maharashtra providence illustrates a spirit of tolerance characteristic of ancient India.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ellora-caves,"Religious devotion was not uncommon in ancient times, but tolerance was often much harder to come by. Happily, for curious travelers and religious devotees alike, the caves at Ellora offer a truly exceptional example of both. Covering an area more than 2 kilometers in size, the Ellora Caves are a massive and humbling tribute to faith and medieval-era workmanship in India. In fact, the term “caves” hardly does justice to the 34 Buddhist, Brahmanist and Jainist temples in Ellora, each painstakingly carved out of the mountainside and filled with delicate works of art. Sculpted Buddhas and other religious figures abound, along with intricately carved images in the walls and decorative fixtures on the temples, usually seen in traditionally masoned buildings, but hardly common for something excavated out of solid rock - particularly using the tools and workforce available in the 5th through 10th centuries, when these temples were created. It’s truly hard to believe that the temples are, in fact, vertically excavated out of stone. Many of them put much easier-to-construct buildings to shame with their elaborate design, demonstrating both the strength of religious conviction that went into their creation as well as the highly skilled craftsmen who participated. It is a feat that would be difficult to match even with modern techniques, and of course far less likely to be undertaken due to the cost and time it would take to create it. But the delicate excavation isn’t the only feature of the Ellora Caves that would be unlikely to find in the modern era. The caves feature art, temple and habitation space from three different religions, proving the level of tolerance and cooperation among the disparate religious groups in India at the time of their creation. The three groups shared the space peacefully throughout the centuries, unafraid to worship near idols of a competing religion – something that would still be remarkable today, or in most other cultural eras for that matter. Indeed, the tolerance is likely not just a nice angle on the story of these temples – it’s likely exclusively due to the remarkable cooperation amongst religious beliefs that the caves became so elaborate and impressive, something any one group may not have been able to accomplish alone, and undoubtedly more grand than they otherwise would have been.",hinduism buddhism subterranean sites caves ecosystems sacred spaces ruins architectural oddities architecture

In the city of Jodhpur, a sea of boxy indigo houses stretches for more than 10 kilometers along the walls of the historic walled old city. A blue pigment coating on a house used to indicate that a Brahmin—the priests of the Indian caste system—dwelled there, but over time the color became a badge of identity for non-Brahmins, too. It’s also said to have insect-repelling abilities. Situated on the edge of the Thar Desert, Jodhpur is also called the “Sun City,” named for the overwhelming amount of bright and sunny days it experiences. It is home to famed forts, palaces, mausoleums, gardens, lakes, and towers, making it a hotspot for tourist activity. Since its founding more than 500 years ago, the city has earned renown for its textile industry, exquisite furniture shops, delectable cuisine, and bustling bazaars, among many other attractions.

116,Shatrunjaya Hill,"Gheti, India",A mecca for India's Jains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shatrunjaya-hill,"As typified by Muslims’ pilgrimages to Mecca or Jews’ to Jerusalem, most religions have epic places to where devotees can travel to better secure their places in heaven. The pilgrimage site for Jains, an Indian religious group, is particularly epic: a hugely complex series of more than 1,000 temples which pilgrims can reach only by climbing up nearly 4,000 steps. Jainism is a relatively small religion, with only a little over 4 million believers in India and small pockets of followers throughout the rest of the world. The Jains’ primary belief is non-violence; they believe that people, animals and even plants have souls and should be treated equally and well. Although they have no gods or spiritual figures, they do live with the principle of reincarnation in mind, hoping to eventually be liberated from the cycle of life and rebirth in an eternal transcedence. The Shatrunjaya Hill site is huge and pilgrimage rites are difficult for such an ascetic religion. The hill’s 3,950 steps often take three hours to climb, with the elderly often hiring a dholi, a seat attached to a pole carried by strong men, to the top. It is the goal of devout Jains to climb the mountain 99 times in their lifetimes. Once at the top, devotees are expected to pay homage at each of the complex’s many tuks, similar to temples. In worship, Jains sweep the grounds with brooms and remove their shoes so they don’t kill anything before sitting down. Then, white-robed pilgrims, monks and nuns chant sacred texts surrounded by Tirthankaras, similar to unclothed Buddha statues. In their building, the temples followed the Jainist principle of non-violence. None of the temples were built with ivory or clay because it contains micro-organisms and insects. Instead, all of the temples – the oldest of which dates back to the 11th century – are made of marble, bronze or stone. 215 kilomters from Ahmedabad and 51 kilometers from Bhavnagar",cultures and civilizations rites and rituals sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture

A smashing blend of Gothic and Islamic ornamentation, the Mahabat Maqbara complex remains one of India’s best kept secrets. This striking structure rising from out of nowhere is the mausoleum of Wazir Bahaduddinbhai Hasainbhai, one of the chief nobles in the Court of Nawab Mahabat Khan II of Junagadh. Construction on the yellow-walled complex began in 1878 by Mahabat Khanji and was completed in 1892 by his successor, Bahadur Khanji. Over a decade’s worth of work culminated in elaborate carvings on the buildings’ inner and outer façades, fine arches, French-style windows, columns and shining silver doorways. On the adjacent mosque, each minaret is encircled from top to bottom with winding staircases. Both buildings topped with distinctive “onion dome” rooflines. The monument’s seemingly perplexing mixture of Indo-Islamic, European, and Gothic architecture makes a bit more sense when considered in the larger context of the complex history of the district of Junagadh itself. Founded in 1748, Junagadh had officially become a British Protectorate in 1807 though was handed over to the East India Company’s control in 1818. For the rest of Great Britain’s colonial rule of India, the Saurashtra region escaped direct administration of British India. Instead, the British divided the territory into more than 100 princely states – including Junagadh – which remained in existence until 1947. The city’s present old town, built during the 19th and 20th centuries, existed in a sort of gubernatorial no man’s land. It is in this very spot that the Mahabat Maqbara complex was built, during the period of Britain’s occupation of India. At the time of India’s independence from British rule in 1947, incumbent ruler Mahabat Khan III elected to join Pakistan despite Junagadh having no common boundary with the new country. Under pressure from the Indian government he fled to Pakistan, and Junagadh reunited with India just three short months after declaring its independence. Despite the nonstop political tumult at its doorstep, Mahabat Maqbara has stood like a beacon as it quietly assumed the diversity of influences surrounding it. For interested visitors, access to the grounds is free, and the entirety of the mosque is open to all. Wazir Bahaduddinbhai Hasainbhai’s mausoleum, however, is explorable from the outside only, though it is said that keys to the interior can be procured from a keeper from the mosque.

118,The Great Wall of India,"Rajsamand, India",The second-longest continuous wall on the planet protects a hidden secret in the deserts of India.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-wall-india,"The wall that surrounds the ancient fort of Kumbhalgarh is one of the best-kept secrets in India, and perhaps the world. Protecting a massive fort that contains over 300 ancient temples, the wall was constructed half a millennium ago in tandem with Kumbhalgarh Fort itself. Often referred to as Kumbhalgarh Wall or simply as Kumbhalgarh Fort as a whole, the wall is perhaps best known by its most sensational—and fitting—name: The Great Wall of India. This is appropriate, as the wall extends over 36 kilometers (22 miles) around the perimeter of the fort, making it the second-longest continuous wall on the planet after the far more well-known Great Wall of China. Its anonymity is mystifying, since this is no crumbling line of bricks fascinating only by description. The wall is massive and breathtakingly majestic as it snakes through valleys and along mountaintops, again bearing a striking resemblance to its cousin in China. At its widest sections, the wall is 15 meters thick and beautifully masoned with thousands of stone bricks and decorative flourishes along the top, making this just as attractive as a tourist destination as it once was effective as a deterrent. This gaudy defense is fitting for the perimeter wall of Kumbhalgarh Fort, itself a hulking, imposing construction, with its many pregnant ramparts bowing out into the desert in boulder-like configurations, stacked atop one another and giving the fort the appearance of a mountain. Kumbhalgarh Fort, together with five other forts in the area, is registered as designated UNESCO World Heritage Site—Hill Forts of Rajasthan. Visitors should beware that this piece of history, while alluring and well-preserved, is not well-trafficked. That remoteness and the potential to have miles of ruins all to oneself is appealing to plenty of off-the-beaten-path travelers, but the walls are tall, the stone hard, and while many of the traps and defensive mechanisms along the wall and fort have been deactivated, that does not mean accidents cannot happen. The most pleasant weather conditions in the area are from October through March. Kumbhalgarh is a good option for a day trip from Udaipur. You can hire a car and driver from the local travel agencies in Udaipur for about 2,800-3,600 rupees for a full day. There are also hourly buses from Udaipur to Kelwara village near the Fort.

119,Hampi,"Hampi, India","The remains of what was, not so long ago, the world's largest city.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hampi,"On the boulder-strewn banks of the Tungabhadra River in Karnataka lie the ruins of Hampi, where the capital of the Vijayanagara Kingdom once stood. From 1336 to its fall in 1565, when it was sacked by Muslim invaders from the North, this was the Hindu capital of Vijayanagara Empire in Southern India. At that time, archaeologists estimate the city held about 250,000 people, which would have made it the largest city in the world. The site at Hampi is home to countless architectural wonders. As in other ancient, abandoned cities—like Palmyra or Teotihuacan—it is possible to stroll down the overgrown paths from building to building and imagine the splendid metropolis that Hampi once was. But in these famous ruins, one must also remember that it was not even 500 years ago (quite recent, archaeologically speaking) that this metropolis was bigger than that of Rome, Baghdad or Istanbul. The Vijayanagar style of architecture combined the Islamic style popular in Northern India with more Eastern elements, creating a new, unique mode that archaeologists call Indo-Saracenic architecture. The result: buildings that feature the stunning geometrical patterns and important structural advances made popular by Islamic builders, but also contain beautiful carvings and sculptures of Hindu gods and other important mythical figures. Besides the magnificent Virupaksha Temple—composed of successively smaller stories so that from below, the building seems to stretch unfathomably high—there are several fascinating structures not to miss, including the Lotus Mahal, the geometrically intricate Stepped Tank, and the iconic stone chariot (pulled by little stone elephants). Be sure to take in the banks of the rushing river, with its incredibly large and precariously positioned boulders. Hampi was made a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1986.

Here, Hindu pilgrims gather to bathe in the sacred springs and reservoirs of the massive complex, which is situated on a hill, high above the flatlands of Rajasthan. A total of seven pools of natural spring water are within the area of Galtaji. The most sacred is Galta Kund, a reservoir that never goes dry. Alongside the lush natural springs are a number of other temples dedicated to various deities and spirits. A temple dedicated to the Hindu monkey god Hanuman is one of the most famous on the site because a tribe of his present day monkey relatives resides there. Along with living in the Galtaji temple, the monkeys also dangle from the intricate temple facades and cause chaos for visitors and pilgrims. They are well known in Jaipur and especially in Galtaji for their mischievous ways. Ironically, the monkeys’ famously naughty behavior is in stark contrast to their seemingly tranquil home. They even engage in fights, robberies, and general havoc right next to calm and sacred pools. Luckily for the monkeys, they are protected by their sacred status and connection to Hanuman. While it is unclear whether their behavior has made them a pest in the temple, it is obvious that it has brought them a small degree of fame.

His innocent hobby began to expand, and during the 1960s, Chand began assembling the rocks, along with pieces of trash he had collected into an exhibition. Construction scraps from Le Corbusier’s vision for Chandigarh, along with broken household items began to take shape as sculptures, and the Nek Chand Saini was born. Although his work was illegal and would have been shut down had it been discovered, in 1976 Chand showed the garden to his superiors and was subsequently given permission and a labor force to further his artistic pursuits. From that time, Chand gave up government work and focused on the garden. Chand and a team of 50 men began heavy work in the mid-1970s and gave the garden a new life force. Sculptures of groups of people, all comprised of recycled materials, took shape around the garden. In many ways, the Rock Garden looks more like a fully functioning village than an art exhibition or statuary. Hundreds of statues dance across the mosaic tiles of the garden, inviting visitors to join in the merriment of Chand’s work. Visitors are even able to join in the community, by using the swing that is suspended beneath the great arches within the garden. Wild gangs of elephants, monkeys, and other animal sculptures also populate the garden, speckling the interior with life. In a country known more for the slums that grow out of its waste, the recycled outsider art of the Rock Garden is an internal triumph and an external spectacle. The garden now spans over 30 acres connected throughout by carefully designed walled passages and trails. Along with the jubilant sculptures, a series of waterfalls designed by Chand, provides a lush atmosphere, giving the entire garden the feeling of a living, breathing jungle community. One of the largest waterfalls descends from a pavilion in the garden, where visitors can walk directly up to the splashing rock wall. Chand’s garden is especially unique in this sense, as the whole area has been created for a whole-body experience of walking, touching, and enjoying the beautiful community that began as a small rock collection. The garden is a living and colorful tribute to art and ingenuity and a wholly Indian exhibition. It is detailed down to the mosaic tiling that visitors walk across in the garden. From the time of its creation, the garden has received worldwide acclaim and can easily be visited from Chandigarh.

When they returned, Jai Singh ordered the construction of the original Jantar Mantar complex in New Delhi, a monumental astronomical observatory constructed entirely out of stone and based on the astronomical tables of the French mathematician Phillipe de la Hire. In all Sawai Jai Singh built a total of five observatories, with the largest being this later construction of the Jantar Mantar in his hometown of Jaipur. Among the stone instruments Jai Singh constructed was the Samrat Yantra, a 73-foot-tall sundial. Though indistinguishable in design from other sundials of the day, it was far and away the most accurate. Its two-second interval markings are more precise than even de la Hire’s table. The smaller but older (and pink) version of the Jantar Mantar can be seen in New Delhi. In 2011, the 31-meter Reloj Solar Multicaja-Zaragoza was completed in Spain, and claimed the title of largest sundial in the world.",sundials astounding timepieces long now locations retro-tech clocks inventions architectural oddities architecture
123,Ajanta Caves,"Ajanta, India",Rock-cut cave complex filled with ancient Buddhist artwork.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ajanta-caves,"Constructed over an 800 year period, the Ajanta Caves span a massive rock face in Maharashtra and are filled with ornate frescoes considered masterpieces of Buddhist art. Ajanta is split into two main series of caves, one built in 200 BCE and the other finished around 600 CE. Each cave opens up into grand halls, bedecked from floor to ceiling in detailed depiction of the Jataka stories, which tell of the Buddha’s past life. These caves are excavated in horse–shoe shaped bend of rock surface nearly 76 m in height overlooking a narrow stream known as Waghora. The location of this valley provided a calm and serene environment for the Buddhist monks who retreated at these secluded places during the rainy seasons. This retreat also provided them with enough time for furthering their religious pursuits through intellectual discourses for a considerably longer period. The caves were excavated in different periods (circa. 2nd century B.C. to 6th century A.D.) according to the necessity. Each cave was connected to the stream by a flight of steps, which are now almost obliterated, albeit traces of some could be noticed at some places. In all, total 30 excavations were hewn out of rock which also include an unfinished one. Out of these, five (cave no. 9, 10, 19, 26, and 29) are chaityagrihas and the rest are viharas. In date and style also, these caves can be divided into two broad groups. The earliest excavations belong to the Hinayana phase of Buddhism of which similar examples could also be seen at Bhaja, Kondane, Pitalkhora, Nasik, etc. In total, 5 caves at Ajanta belong to this phase, viz., 9 & 10 which are chaityagrihas and 8, 12, 13, & 15A which are viharas. These caves are datable to the pre-Christian era, the earliest among them being Cave 10 dating from the second century B.C. The object of worship is a stupa here and these caves exhibit the imitation of wooden construction to the extent that the rafters and beams are also sculpted even though they are non-functional. The addition of new excavations could be noticed again during the period of Vakatakas, the contemporaries of the Imperial Guptas. The caves were caused to be excavated by royal patronage and the feudatories under the Vakatakas as illustrated by the inscriptions found in the caves. Varahadeva, the minister of Vakataka king Harishena (A.D. 475-500) dedicated Cave 16 to the Buddhist Sangha while Cave 17 was the gift of a prince (who subjugated Asmaka) feudatory to the same king. The flurry of activities at Ajanta was between mid 5th century A.D. to mid 6th century A.D. However, Hieun Tsang, the famous Chinese traveller who visited India during the first half of 7th century A.D. has left a vivid and graphic description of the flourishing Buddhist establishment here even though he did not visit the caves. A solitary Rashtrakuta inscription in cave no. 26 indicates its use during 8th – 9th centuries A.D. The second phase departs from the earlier one with the introduction of new pattern in layout as well as the centrality of Buddha image, both in sculpture as well as in paintings The world famous paintings at Ajanta also fall into two broad phases. The earliest is noticed in the form of fragmentary specimens in cave nos. 9 & 10, which are datable to second century B.C. The headgear and other ornaments of the images in these paintings resemble the bas-relief sculpture of Sanchi and Bharhut. The second phase of paintings started around 5th – 6th centuries A.D. and continued for the next two centuries. The specimen of these exemplary paintings of Vakataka period could be noticed in cave nos. 1, 2, 16 and 17. The variation in style and execution in these paintings also are noticed, mainly due to different authors of them. A decline in the execution is also noticed in some paintings as indicated by some rigid, mechanical and lifeless figures of Buddha in some later period paintings. The main theme of the paintings is the depiction of various Jataka stories, different incidents associated with the life of Buddha, and the contemporary events and social life also. The ceiling decoration invariably consists of decorative patterns, geometrical as well as floral. The paintings were executed after elaborate preparation of the rock surface initially. The rock surface was left with chisel marks and grooves so that the layer applied over it can be held in an effective manner. The ground layer consists of a rough layer of ferruginous earth mixed with rock-grit or sand, vegetable fibres, paddy husk, grass and other fibrous material of organic origin on the rough surface of walls and ceilings. A second coat of mud and ferruginous earth mixed with fine rock-powder or sand and fine fibrous vegetable material was applied over the ground surface. Then the surface was finally finished with a thin coat of lime wash. Over this surface, outlines are drawn boldly, then the spaces are filled with requisite colours in different shades and tones to achieve the effect of rounded and plastic volumes. The colours and shades utilised also vary from red and yellow ochre, terra verte, to lime, kaolin, gypsum, lamp black and lapis lazuli. The chief binding material used here was glue. The paintings at Ajanta are not frescoes as they are painted with the aid of a binding agent, whereas in fresco the paintings are executed while the lime wash is still wet which, thereby acts as an intrinsic binding agent.",outsider architecture subterranean sites caves ecosystems architectural oddities architecture

Banyan is the tree native to India and is botanically it is known as Ficus benghalensis. From a distance, the tree has the appearance of a forest, but what appear to be individual trees are actually aerial roots- around 3,600 of them. After two cyclones in the 19th century that led to a fungal attack, the tree’s main 15.7-meter-wide (51-foot) trunk had to be removed. Fortunately, the “clonal colony” of the tree itself remains healthy. A 330-meter-long road was constructed around the tree so that visitors could drive around the circumference, but the Great Banyan continues to spread beyond, growing wider with each passing year. Currently, it is already over 450-meters.

125,Hill Forts of Rajasthan,"Chittorgarh, India",A complex of six forts embedded in the Rajasthan hills.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hill-forts-of-rajasthan,"The six hill forts of Rajasthan, India, date from between the 8th and 18th centuries. The mix of architecture melds with the surrounding landscape of forests, deserts, hills, and even rivers that bring water into holding structures of the forts. The forts include those in Chittorgarh, Kumbhalgarh, Sawai Madhopur, Jhalawar, Jaipur, and Jaisalmer. Whole towns are held within, including temples and palaces, some of which are still in use. The Hill Forts of Rajasthan were declared an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013. Most forts have registered guides who can be booked via the main ticketing office. Though not compulsory, it is an intriguing way of exploring the fort, especially so with the guide telling stories about each nook and cranny of the fort, topped with a bit of garnishing of their own. Beware of unregistered guides as they might not be as conversant nor as knowledgeable and might try to fleece unsuspecting tourists for more money.",unesco forts architectural oddities architecture
126,Rani Ki Vav,"Patan, India","This magnificent stepwell is designed as an inverted temple and adorned with 1,500 sculptures.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rani-ki-vav,"The first thing you notice about Rani ki vav is the size. It is mammoth, the largest stepwell of its kind, and also sumptuously beautiful. But all of this is below ground. From the plain, as you approach, it descends suddenly. Designed as an inverted temple with four pavilions on various levels, it highlights the sanctity of water. As you descend seven levels, you pass sculptural panels of the highest artistic quality, comprised of 500 principal sculptures and 1,000 minor ones. A masterpiece of architecture, construction, and adornment, Rani ki vav in Patan, Gujarat, is the only stepwell to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is considered the foremost example of this type of complex architectural technique, demonstrating great beauty in proportion and detail. It is believed that Rani ki vav (in Gujarat, a “vav” is a type of stepwell) was constructed by Rani Udaymati in the memory of Raja Bhimdev, son of Mularaja, the founder of the Solanki dynasty. The sculptures represent religious, mythological, and secular images. The central theme of the images is around 10 incarnations of Vishnu. At the water level, there is a sculpture of Vishnu reclining on a 1,000-headed snake. Other sculptures represent apsaras (celestial nymphs), strikingly beautiful in feature and pose. Like other vavs, Rani ki vav was not only used for water collecting; it held great spiritual significance and was also a place for socializing. It was built on the banks of the Saraswati River, and it flooded and was silted over until the 1980s. It was restored to its original design and is now in very good condition. Rani ki vav is situated in the town of Patan, about 77 miles from the capital, Ahmedabad, a three-hour journey. There are many trains and buses from Ahmedabad to Patan. It’s open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The best time to visit Rani ki vav is in the morning, when it first opens. There are few people there and the golden sunlight will make it very photogenic.",stepwells hinduism unesco infrastructure religion sacred spaces architecture
127,Golden Temple,"Amritsar, India","This peaceful Sikh gurudwara serves around 50,000 free meals every day within its gilded walls.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golden-temple,"Every day, Shri Harmandir Sahib, known worldwide as the Golden Temple, serves upwards of 100,000 free meals to whoever shows up. This beautiful gold-coated gurudwara (temple) in Amritsar is the most sacred place for Sikhs. IIt’s both the spiritual and temporal centre of the religion, and thousands of pilgrims, tourists, and followers arrive daily to worship, pray, volunteer, and soak up the peaceful vibes. The Sikh religion rests on several important values, including equality and community service. To that end, every gurudwara offers langar, a free communal kitchen. The langar at Golden Temple follows this tradition on a big scale, in keeping with the size of the gurudwara and the number of visitors it gets. You have to see the communal kitchen to believe it. The huge size of the rooms, cooking vats, mounds of food, plus the numbers of people prepping, cooking, and cleaning is a site to behold. It’s virtually a small army at work, and many of them are volunteers. Lentils are cooked in huge vats, on open fires, that take two people with large wooden paddles, to stir. While some volunteers prepare and roll rotis, a roti-making machine was brought in a few years ago to keep up with the capacity. It can make 25,000 rotis an hour. The kitchen uses 12,000 kilograms of flour, 1,600 kilograms of pulses (lentils), 1,600 kilograms of vegetables, and 1,400 kilograms of rice per day. About 25 percent of the food is donated. A traditional vegetarian meal of rice, lentils, vegetables, and rotis is served in two large dining halls that each accommodate 5,000 people. Everyone sits on the floor, in long rows, as volunteer servers walk up and down dishing out food. A machine on wheels serves clean, filtered drinking water, and another one serves tea. The metal plates, bowls, cups, and cutlery are all washed by a small army, too. A total of about 500 employees and 250 volunteers work in the kitchen at a time. Volunteers are allowed to do everything except cooking. Langar was started by the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak, to uphold the principle of equality. All people, regardless of religion, gender, caste, class, and color sit together on the floor to eat. It was a revolutionary concept in 16th century India, when Sikhism began. The langar also expresses the ethics of sharing, community, and inclusiveness.  The Golden Temple is open every day and meals are served starting at 8 a.m.",gold temples religion sacred spaces food
128,Bhangarh Fort,"Bhangarh, India","This abandoned fort is said to be the most haunted place in India, so much so that entry is prohibited after sunset.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bhangarh-fort,"Built in the 17th century, India’s Bhangarh Fortis thought to be the most haunted place in all of India, causing the local populace to build a town away from the abandoned military installation and outlaw anyone from entering the grounds after sunset. Technically, Bhangarh Fort is actually a small city with temples, palaces, and multiple gates. The sprawling grounds cover a swath of land at the foot of a picturesque mountain, but according to locals, all is not well in on the well preserved grounds. A number of legends regarding the lonely historical buildings exist, but two stand out above the rest. One legend speaks of a holy man who lived in the area of the fort and built a house which he did not want any other house to eclipse, warning that should the shadow of any taller building ever touch his abode, he would destroy the entire fort city. Which he assumedly did. The second prominent legend involves a curse that was laid on the city by a mythical wizard as he was killed by a woman he had just tried to magically dose. As he was crushed by a boulder, he cursed the city to be destroyed and sure enough, a marauding soon sacked the fort, killed each and every resident. If you are considering visiting Bhangarh Fort then you will have to go during the day time. In fact, one of the departments of the Government of India has prohibited entry between sunset and sunrise. The Archeological Survey of India, the body that looks after historical monuments in India, has a sign that notices visitors of this rule. I have no idea why they have a sign post in Hindi and not in English considering that Rajasthan is a place where people from all over the place visit. Perhaps one of the reasons could be that this particular place is not popular amongst foreign tourists hence they have not bothered to have a sign in English. The signboard simply says“…It is strictly prohibited to enter the borders of Bhangarh before sunrise and after sunset. Legal action would be taken against those who do not follow these instructions…” It seems to be warning visitors to stay away during dark. There is a local saying that if you do enter this area, you will not return. These fanciful tales may seem outlandish, but the stories were so pervasive that the entire fort city was abandoned and the citizens established a whole new city nearby (Bhangarh). Today, the abandoned buildings are remarkably well preserved, and available to be visited during daylight hours. They offer guided sunset yoga at the platforms of the temples. The fear of the city’s ghosts led the Archeological Survey of India to post a sign forbidding entry to the area after dark. If you are considering visiting Bhangarh Fort, then you will have to go during the day time. In fact, one of the departments of the Government of India has prohibited entry between sunset and sunrise. A sign informs visitors of this rule, though it is not in English.

129,Elephanta Caves,"Gharapuri, India","An extraordinary ""City of Caves"" carved from solid stone.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephanta-caves,"When the Portuguese arrived on the west coast of India in 1534, they discovered an extraordinary island riddled with ancient galleries carved from the solid rock of the hillsides. Filled with exquisite carvings and standing sculptures, they named the island and its “city of caves” Elephanta, after the monumental elephant they found on the island. Then they began using the carvings for target practice. Located off the coast of Mumbai, the Elephanta Caves on Elephanta Island (also known as the Island of Gharapuri) are thought to date as far back as the 5th to 8th centuries, although their origins remain mysterious. There are seven caves carved from the rocky basalt hillside, including both Buddhist and Hindu sculptures and bas reliefs. The larger group of five caves feature Hindu imagery, while a smaller group of caves on the eastern side of the island are Buddhist. Originally painted, the now plain stone has survived the centuries a bit worse for wear but extraordinary nonetheless. An important part of Indian architectural tradition, there are more than 1500 rock-cut structures in India—more than anywhere else in the world. The caves at Elephanta are only a small portion of extraordinary rock architecture in the country, such as the rock-hewn temples at the Ellora and Ajanta complexes. The Elephanta Caves were restored in 1970, and are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are still concerns for the future of the caves, suffering both from the elements and ravages of time, as well as pressures from tourism and a growing population on the island. The elephant carving originally standing guard on the island is now on display at Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Mumbai.",caves outsider art ecosystems sculptures
130,Meenakshi Amman Temple,"Madurai, India",This ancient Hindu temple is covered in thousands of colorful statues and has a long mythological history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/meenakshi-amman-temples,"The Meenakshi Amman Temple is the heart of the ancient city of Madurai in Tamil Nadu, India. A religious and mythological symbol dating back 2,500 years, the temple’s 14 towers are each covered in thousands of colorful stone figures depicting animals, gods and demons. This sacred site draws in upwards of one million visitors each year for the 10-day Chithirai Festival to celebrate the marriage of Meenakshi (the Hindu Goddess Parvati) to Sundareswara (the Hindu God Shiva) — a divine marriage believed by Hindus to be the “biggest event on Earth.” According to ancient Tamil literature, the Meenakshi Amman Temple was originally built 2,500 years ago by survivors of the lost continent Kumari Kandam, a mythological triangle-shaped continent that was said to span the Indian Ocean, touching Australia, Madagascar and India. Although this continent’s existence is currently disproven, members of the Tamil Renaissance Movement once believed it to be the hearth of Tamil culture. But that’s all mythology. In fact, the temple was built by Tamil Hindus native to southeastern India, and it first appeared in recorded history in the 600s AD. In the 1300s, the sacred structure was ransacked and destroyed by the Muslim general Malik Kafur in a successful attempt to spread Islam to Madurai. It wasn’t until nearly 250 years later, in 1559, that the structure was rebuilt by the first Nayak king of Madurai. The Meenakshi Amman Temple remains standing today, the tallest tower reaching 170 feet high. The historic temple was even nominated for the New Seven Wonders of the World.",thrones hinduism islam mythology festivals temples

The pristine white petals of the temple are meant to symbolize folding man and nature into a wholesome oneness. Since its completion in 1986, the Lotus Temple in New Delhi has seen 70 million visitors and is said to be more frequented than the Eiffel Tower and Taj Mahal. Its elegant design has made it the toast of the architectural world, and the peaceful and accepting principles behind its creation have made it a 21st-century monument to interfaith cooperation. Visitors approach the Temple to one of its nine entrances, passing by lush blue-green pools and pristine walkways. After entering the massive temple, visitors find themselves elbow to elbow with a quilt of diversity, who have also come to marvel at the 130-foot-high gathering space that can hold 2,500 people.

132,India's Giant Technicolor Squirrels,"Bhimashankar, India",These particularly resplendent rodents are the state animal of Maharashtra.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/indian-giant-malabar-squirrel,"If you’re passing below a thick tree canopy in peninsular India and happen to hear a scurrying above you, be sure to look up. You might catch a glimpse of a striking squirrel whose fur appears to have been hand-painted with splashes of brown, orange, maroon, and black. Meet the Malabar giant squirrel, which boasts an all-natural technicolor coat. Also known as shekru, these bright, bushy beauties, which are endemic to India, stretch as much as three feet long—much longer than the eastern gray squirrel and other svelter counterparts. The patchwork fur may help the squirrels hide up in the sun-speckled canopy, which would be an advantage, because they spend most of their lives up there, scampering among the branches and nibbling on flowers, bark, seeds, insects, and bird eggs. Their feathery, charcoal-colored tails help them balance while they teeter on narrow branches or hang straight down to feast. High above the forest floor, they’re out of many predators’ reach—but if they are startled, though (say, by one of their winged predators, like the crested serpent eagle), they plop down flush against the branches, as though trying to melt into them. The cute critter is the state animal of Maharashtra—and if you’re setting out to spot some, your best bet will be in that region’s Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary, tucked among the green, rolling Western Ghats mountain range. The site is also home to one of India’s 12 jyortirlingas, or shrines, dedicated to the god Shiva. Devotees often flock to the temple during monsoon season—an especially wild time to trek through hills tangled with dense, fog-cloaked forests, and dip a toe into the pools at the base of waterfalls. The sanctuary was established in the 1980s and has seen the squirrel population grow since. The animals have popped up on endangered species lists, but a census of the furry residents found that their numbers climbed by eight percent in the sanctuary between 2015 and 2016. Researchers surveyed squirrel nests in the nearby mango, coconut palm, and jamun trees and estimated that there were 2,145 individuals bedding down in the branches there. Each squirrel may build as many as eight nests; in 2017, the sanctuary’s census counts more than 22,000 of them. As an extra boost to the animal’s numbers in the wild, the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Research Centre launched a breeding effort in July 2018. Soon, there may be more of these colorful creatures than ever.  The nearest airport and train station are in Pune. Buses depart regularly from Shivajinagar Bus Terminus, but private transportation may be easier if you plan to tack on some impromptu exploring.",squirrel rodents tropical india sanctuaries wildlife sanctuaries ecology forests conservation ecosystems animals

The exact age of the founding of the Key Monastery is not known but it is believed to originally date back to 1100 CE, although many believe the site is even older. Now sitting on top of a mountain foothill, the early structures built by the original monks would have been much lower. However as the peaceful Buddhists were attacked by the area Mongol barbarians the reconstruction efforts would simply build upon what had gone before, eventually creating the erratic patchwork of rooms, tight hallways, and hidden courtyards that exists today. Much of the monastery bears a distinct Chinese design influence like many similar structures in the area, dating back to a period in the 14th century when the style came to the area. The interiors are also rich with historic murals and documents precious to the orders which have lived in the ever-changing monastery. Today Key Monastery is still a fully-functioning training ground for lamas operated by a Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhist monks. Around 250 monks reside on the site at any given time, training, farming, and generally keeping the thousand-year-old wonder alive.",monks buddhism monasteries architectural oddities architecture

The half-mile ascent through seven gates takes you almost 500 feet up to a plateau that’s nearly four miles long. The fort covers the entire plateau, encompassing a village, a reservoir, several active temples, and countless deserted, sublimely beautiful ruins. There’s so much to see here, including the remains of ancient palaces, temples, and towers built between the 8th and 16th centuries in a wide variety of architectural styles. Many are shrouded in stories and legends. Near the crumbling 15th-century Palace of Rana Kumbha are the exquisite Meera and Kumbha Shyam Temples. The smaller Meera Temple was built for Princess Meerabai, a 16th-century mystic poet who to this day is considered a legendary figure. After the death of Princess Meerabai’s husband, the crown prince, her in-laws attempted to murder her, but she credited her survival to Lord Krishna’s intervention. Henceforth, she devoted her life to Krishna, and left the palace to wander among the holy men of North India, composing poems and songs that continue to be performed. Other key sites include Padmini’s Palace and the lavishly carved Vijay Stambh, or Tower of Victory, the symbol of Chittorgarh. Visitors can climb to the top, rising over 100 feet up a set of dark narrow stairs. Padmini’s Palace is in a slightly dilapidated state, but you can still stand inside and see the serene pavilion, surrounded by a small pool in the center of the fort, where Sultan Alauddin Khiliji beheld the legendary beauty Rani Padmini in one of the most well-known historical tales in India. In 1303, the infamous warrior king was reputed to have glimpsed Rani Padmini’s reflection in a mirror as she sat on the steps of a pavilion and fell in love with her. From his seat of power in Delhi, he then launched a brutal attack on the kingdom of Chittor to capture her, after betraying Rana Ratan Singh, Rani Padmini’s husband. When defeat was inevitable, the proud Rajput people of Chittor chose to sacrifice their lives, rather than be captured by the invaders. The men rode out into battle and certain death, while 13,000 women and children jumped into a massive funeral pyre, in a practice called jauhar—including Rani Padmini. Amazingly, this policy of death before submission was put to the ultimate test two more times in the history of the Sisodia clan at Chittorgarh. In 1535, Sultan Bahadur Shah besieged the fort, resulting in another ghastly jauhar. The final disaster happened just a few years later when Emperor Akbar took the fort, and again the women and children surrendered their lives in jauhar.  Chittorgarh, also called Chittor Fort, is the largest hill fort in Rajasthan, and to see it all you will cover a distance of 8 miles (13 kilometres). Guides are available. The fort is open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The foreign ticket price is 100 rupees. Domestic tickets are 50 rupees, or 25 rupees for seniors and students.

135,Mahila Baag Jhalra,"Jodhpur, India",Hidden in the shadow of a rocky fortress is one concubine’s long-forgotten legacy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mahila-baag-jhalra,"Tourists flock to Jodhpur to see the astonishing Mehrangarh Fort, a 15th-century bastion that looms over the city like a watchful parent. It’s enormous, perched on a hunk of rock that’s always in view. But just a stone’s throw away, another of Jodhpur’s monuments has a much lower profile, quite literally: The 18th-century Mahila Baag Jhalra, a subterranean stepwell that’s so unobtrusive it’s almost impossible to see, even when you’re standing a few feet away. The lovely, multi-layered and multi-hued structure appears in no guidebook, on any tour, or in hardly anyone’s consciousness. But it wasn’t always that way. Stepwells were sophisticated water-harvesting structures built throughout India starting around 600 CE.  There were thousands of them, each providing continual, year-round access to water that fluctuated dramatically between the dry and the rainy seasons. Long flights of steps could reach the ground water at its lowest, and as water rose during monsoons, the steps would submerge, sometimes entirely. This nifty, efficient system continued for over a millennium, gradually waning by the 19th century. Despite their past prominence, stepwells fell completely off history’s grid and today, most are entirely unknown, even within India. Modern water pumps and plumbing rendered these unique subterranean marvels obsolete, and now the vast majority are decrepit, anonymous, often filthy, and generally heartbreaking. Some are well-maintained by the government and attract tourists, but not the graceful Mahila Baag. It lies utterly forlorn just outside the old walls of Jodhpur next to a noisy road, crammed between shops and dwellings, obscured by motorcycles and electrical lines. Passersby are oblivious, and it’s nearly unimaginable that Mahila Baag Jhalra was originally embedded in an elegant garden (baag). The visual chaos and din only add to the excitement of discovery when standing along the edge of this unexpected treasure. A dazzling array of pyramidal stairs is disorienting, as is the experience of looking down into architecture, not up at it as usual. It’s even more disorienting to start the descent, as though entering a drawing by M.C. Escher. You must pick your way carefully among the befuddling combinations of stairs. Paying attention is crucial. The stepwell is allegedly named for Mayla, a beautiful and wealthy concubine who is said to have commissioned it. Through the centuries, Mayla evolved into Mahila, which means “lady” in Hindi, and compared to the brutal-looking fort, this diminutive, inconspicuous structure seems especially dainty. It’s a multi-hued layer cake of stone, built from the pink sandstone seen in so many of Rajasthan’s monuments. There are small pavilions at each corner that were shady retreats in scorching summers when cooling off by the water’s edge must have been appealing. Now, the water is clogged with trash, even though hardy fish can be seen swimming under the surface. Luckily, there’s much to be hopeful for in Jodhpur these days. For hundreds of years the city was renowned for its advanced water harvesting systems, which Mahila Baag Jhalra was part of.

136,Agrasen ki Baoli,"New Delhi, India","A startling, centuries-old subterranean marvel hides in plain sight.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agrasen-ki-baoli,"New Delhi’s Connaught Place is one of the city’s most raucous commercial areas, teeming with locals and tourists alike. Yet just a short walk away down a peaceful residential street, a centuries-old, subterranean marvel hides behind a mundane stone wall in the shadow of modern high-rises. Agrasen ki baoli is a stepwell, otherwise known as “baoli” or “vav”, depending on the region. Thousands of these sophisticated water-harvesting structures proliferated throughout India beginning around 600 CE, but they fell into disuse with the advent of water pumps and plumbing. Flights of steps were excavated adjacent to deep well shafts, ensuring that dramatically-fluctuating ground water could be reached all year long. Today, most stepwells are abandoned and terribly dilapidated, although a relative handful have been restored by the government, as is Agrasen ki baoli. There are still hundreds—perhaps thousands—of these little known subterranean edifices found all over India, whether in remote districts, in small villages, or enormous cities like Delhi, which once boasted a hundred. It’s impossible to describe the experience of walking through an unassuming gateway and being greeted by a vertiginous plunge. Standing at ground level, there are steps cascading four levels into the earth, excavated by hand hundreds of years before the Machine Age. Arched corridors line either side, and at the far end, a stack of dark, faintly ominous openings leads directly into a dry well shaft. This is more than merely a startling view, it’s downright disorienting: We’re used to looking up at architecture, not down into it, which adds to the breathtaking power, not just of Agrasen ki Baoli, but nearly every stepwell. Little factual information about stepwells exists, or is just wildly conflicting, which makes determining construction dates impossible. Such is the case with Agrasen ki baoli, named for a legendary king said to have lived 5,000 years ago, but whose existence has never been proven. The existing structure was probably built in the late 14th century or early 15th century but was restored more recently. One thing is certain: Whatever the stepwell’s origin, it was located far outside the old city of Delhi and would have been a welcome oasis for travelers seeking shelter. The niched corridors running along both sides offered cool retreat with water just a few feet away, so holing up for hours or days would have been inviting. On the other hand, Agrasen ki baoli is considered one of the most haunted places in town, thanks to tales of curses, demons, suicides, and ghosts that often surround stepwells. The deep shadows, dark water, and echo of flapping pigeons can guarantee a creepy atmosphere, but that can change. These days the stepwell is thronged with fans of the 2014 hit movie, PK, in which Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan played an alien. His home? Agrasen ki baoli.

137,Auroville,"Bommayapalayam, India","This experimental utopian ""city of the future"" in rural India may hold a dark secret.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/auroville,"A dozen miles north of Pondicherry, India, there is a town to which you already belong and already have citizenship, and which awaits your arrival. To live there you will need to give up some of the comforts you may have grown accustomed to. No drinking, no smoking, and very little in the way of personal property is allowed here. You can’t own your own house; business and money is communal. Even more than goods, you will have to leave behind ideas: No politics or religion are allowed in this town. Welcome to Auroville, the self-proclaimed “city of the future” and the “city of dawn.” Despite being in a rural region of India, this experimental community was started by a Westerner. The “spiritual companion” of famous Indian independence-fighter, philosopher, and yogi Sri Aurobindo, Mirra Alfassa was a Jewish occultist and spiritualist born to an Egyptian mother and a Turkish father in France. She claimed to have inherited Sri Aurobindo’s spiritual essence upon his death in 1950. Going by the title “The Mother,” Alfassa was worshiped as the female incarnation of the divine, and was the first Westerner to become an Indian guru. Alfassa established Auroville in 1968—a good year for experimental utopias—and on February 28th, 1968, roughly 5,000 people from 124 countries gathered to mix soil from their countries to mark the founding of a town that “belongs to humanity as a whole.” Wanting her community to be a “universal township” meant to exist outside of nations, creeds, politics, religion, and economics—though one could say Auroville has all these things, just of their own making – Alfassa hoped that this new city would help bring Earth to a new consciousness of the “supramental.” Intended to house 50,000, the city centers around a giant golden geodesic dome known as the “Matrimandir” or Mother Temple. Within the golden Mother Temple, silence is absolute, and a spiral ramp leads to “a 70-centimeter crystal ball in a gold mount” as well as a glowing “single ray of sunlight that is directed on the globe from the top of structure.” When there is no sunlight, the beam is faked by a solar-powered light. The neighborhoods of Auroville, with names like Aspiration, Certitude, Discipline, and Grace, are laid out in a swirling spiral galaxy shape. Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of Auroville is the line which it walks between respectability and new-age cultism. While supported by UNESCO and the Indian government, the town also “dynamises” its water by having the water “listen” to Bach and Mozart. And while the town features a Evolution Laboratory – currently the town library— Aurovilians also race through their quiet Utopia on dirt bikes, the preferred mode of transportation. Much more disturbing is that there have also been allegations of abuse of the locals, few of whom become Aurovilians, and tolerance of sexual abuse of local children who live near Auroville by visitors and guests at Auroville. Today, 41 years after its founding and despite its having been designed for 50,000, Auroville is home to only 2,000 or so citizens, though the community comes from a diverse 44 countries. The Mother Temple still remains unfinished, and the town has built few of its proposed structures. Aurovilians seem little worried, though. In their words, “What is more important to Auroville than dates and numbers is the quality of everything, especially the quality and consciousness of its participants.” One can stay as a guest at Auroville by paying a “guest contribution,” or a daily fee. So much for no economics.",utopia week utopias intriguing environs ecosystems sacred spaces
138,Mysore Palace,"Mysore, India","Modest by day, illuminated majestically at sunset.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-majestic-mysore-palace-mysore-india,"In a city famous for its many palaces, the former Royal residence known as Amba Vilas is an exceptionally grand building among grand buildings. It is the fourth palace built on the same location since the beginning of the Wodeyar dynasty in 1399. Designed by the British architect Henry Irwin who designed several other iconic buildings of British India, the palace is a masterpiece of Indo-Saracenic design, which blends together Hindu, Muslim, Rajput, and Gothic styles of architecture. The current palace was designed to be erected on the remains of the earlier palace, which was destroyed by fire at the wedding ceremony of princess Jayalakshmmanni in 1897. Construction was completed in 1912. There are four entrances to the palace, aligned to the cardinal points. Inside, surrounded by tile work and huge pillars, the palace hosts a portrait gallery, an armory, and collections of costume and jewelry. Every fall during the festival of Dasara, the golden royal throne is displayed. At night 97,000 light bulbs transform the building into a glowing spectacle. Though the lighting happens at 7pm, crowds start to grow outside the gate by 6pm to witness light-up. Join the queue about a quarter to 7pm. Though the queue is long, it moves pretty fast. Don’t move your eyes from the palace —the moment of lighting up is a beautiful and superlative sight. Most visitors consist of Indians from outside Mysore, usually in large family groups. A handful of youths roam the site offering to sell sandalwood souvenirs and silver chains, a common occurrence in a region where young children are sent off to work, instead of schools, to meet the daily living demands of families. When entering the palace, visitors are restricted to the residence garden and are able to view the main palace only from a distance. If you’re lucky, you may also catch a live performance by local musicians. If you’re up for a new experience, enjoy a ride on the pony-cart. The driver will take you around the outside of the complete palace and bring you to the main gate. The palace complex also includes twelve Hindu temples. The oldest of these was built in the 14th century, while the most recent was built in 1953.  From Bangalore, take a 3.5 hour cab ride down to Mysore. Mysore Palace is located within the Old Fort. No cameras are allowed beyond a certain point; tourists caught taking pictures will have their cameras confiscated. No shoes are allowed within the palace. The best time to visit the palace is during Dussehra when the entire compound is beautifully decorated and lit in a golden hue. Though Mysore Palace is lit every Sunday to the fact that it remains closed on Sundays, makes it impossible to see it from close. During Dusshera, the entire place is lit and you can enjoy it from up close. Another interesting thing to see in Mysore Palace is the 45 minute light and sound show that depicts the 400 years of history of Mysore city. The light and sound show takes place every evening, except for Sundays and public holidays.",electrical oddities eccentric homes homes
139,Temples of Khajuraho,"Chhatarpur, India","Temples adorned with intricate, erotic sculptures make up one of the ""seven wonders"" of India.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temples-of-kahurajo,"Nestled in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh is a grouping of impressive and very intricately carved temples famous for their depictions of erotic scenes on the outer walls, thus gaining the nickname the Kamasutra Temples. Most of the temples were built by the Chandela dynasty between 950 and 1050 CE. They once covered an area of just over seven miles with 85 temples, but now only 25 spread out over four miles remain. The temples were in active use through the end of 12th century, but that came to an end in the 13th century when the Chandela kingdom was seized by the army of Delhi Sultanate. The area where the temples resided remained in Muslim control through the 18th century. During this time period the temples were subject to abuse, destruction and neglect. Over the centuries, due to Khajuraho’s remoteness, the jungle reclaimed the area and the temples were mostly forgotten. In the 1830s the temples were rediscovered by British surveyor T.S. Burt with the help of locals. The temples are most well known for their erotically carved sculptures, but upon arrival it becomes more of a Where’s Waldo activity to find these salacious scenes. Less than 10% of the sculptures are erotic in nature and they are known as Kama scenes. Kama literally means “desire, wish, longing” and is one of the four goals of human life in Hindu traditions; it is considered an essential human pursuit in balance with the other three goals: Dharma, Artha and Moksha. All goals of human life are represented at the Khajuraho Temples along with scenes of day to day life of medieval India, such as farming, playing music, and making pottery. It’s possible that the Kama scenes are tantric in nature but more likely it’s an homage to human life and actively. Whether one comes to peek at the adult content, admire the incredible art and engineering, or stroll around the lush grounds, it’s well worth the time to make the journey.",outsider architecture statues

At least that must have been the logic behind the ancient Kalavantin Durg. Nothing more than a small cave built into the summit of a towering spike of rock, the fort, built around 530 BC, nonetheless gives a perfect view of the surrounding Indian lands. The fort is only accessible by ascending thousands of hand-carved steps, known as the “Climb to Heaven,” which rise at a dizzyingly steep angle to the top of the spire. While no one is sure of the true origins of the fort or its name, tradition holds that the lookout was named after a princess, although there is no evidence to support this. The fort no longer holds any military significance, but it still attracts waves of foreign visitors each year who want to brave the treacherous steps up to the top.",forts mountains geology
141,Mayong - The Land of Black Magic,"Mayang, India",The Indian capital of black magic and witchcraft.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mayong-the-land-of-black-magic,"In northeastern India, there is a city with a mythological history even deeper than the Brahmaputra River that runs through it. Nicknamed “The Land of Black Magic,” the untouched, secluded village of Mayong holds one of the oddest magical backstories on the planet. While some villages pass down the skills of farming or craftsmanship to the next generation, the elders of Mayong pass down sorcery and magic to the town’s youth. Many speculate that the name “Mayong” originated from the Sanskrit word “maya”, which means “illusion”. This certainly seems to be the case in Mayong, where, according to legend, people have been morphed into animals, monstrous beasts have been tamed, and men have disappeared into thin air by uttering “Luki Mantra.” Mayong has been India’s center for witchcraft and wizardry since its inception many centuries ago. In the early days of Mayong, legend has it, if you chanted “Uran Mantra” you would be able to fly through the air and land directly beside your true love. According to legend, witches and the saints of black magic took shelter in the Mayong woods years ago. In 1337, Muhammad Shah’s army of 100,000 horsemen perished at the hands of witchcraft in a location near Mayong, evidence to the village’s locals of the high prevalence of black magic in the area. Excavators have even found swords in Mayong that resemble those used to sacrifice humans in other parts of India. Mayong today is just as dark and eerie, but slightly more open, with the occasional traveller passing through town. The locals of Mayong offer palm reading to these visitors and claim to be able to predict the future with the help of broken glass and seashells. Witch doctors are also abundant in Mayong. Local healers treat pain by placing a copper dish on the source of the injury and wait for the dish to “eat away” the pain. If the pain is too severe, the dish will overheat and shatter onto the ground. The witch doctors also serve as a lost and found in the town. If someone loses something, the witch doctor will place a flower in a metal bowl. According to the locals, the bowl will then move along the ground, completely on its own, until it reaches the location of the lost or stolen items. There are a countless number of spells in Mayong, but, according to mythology, none of them have the power to change the weather. Says Naba Deka, a local to the area, “there are spells to turn a leaf into a fish, or an evil man into an animal, but magic cannot fight against nature’s fury, so there is no spell against the annual floods.” Every year, a handful of Indians travel to Mayong either to practice dark magic and learn the secrets of witchcraft or to visit the adjacent Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, which hosts the world’s densest population of Indian rhinos. In fact, the animals and magic of Mayong often go hand in hand. This can be seen at the Mayong-Pobitora Festival, which celebrates the fusion between wildlife and sorcery.",black magic witchcraft magic

Founded in 1459 by Rajput leader Rao Jodha of the Rathore clan, it is owned and managed by the Jodhpur royal family to this day. You can see the palatial hill fort from just about everywhere in the city, its distinctive walls soaring above the rocky plateau from which they were carved. Mehrangarh means “fort of the sun,” referring to the myth that the Jodhpur royal family descended from the sun god, Surya. A visit to Mehrangarh Fort takes hours, and it’s worth every minute. Here, you can experience the history of war, the culture of honor, and the life of extravagance that Rajput royals enjoyed. After the long walk from the city up to the fort (you can also take a taxi or rickshaw), you enter through the main gate, and continue to walk up a ramp through a series of seven gates. At a gate called Loha Pol, iron spikes are embedded in the wood (to prevent an elephant attack) and a set of small red hand prints on the wall memorialize a horrifying historic event. These are the handprints of the wives of Maharaja Man Singh’s widows, left there as they went to throw themselves on his funeral pyre in 1843. Inside the fort, the royal palaces now serve as the Mehrangarh Museum. You can walk from one to another, through enclosed courtyards adorned with lattice work and charming balconies. The former palaces are filled with antiques, artifacts, and art works, and even complete rooms. You will find miniature paintings, palanquins, howdahs (elephant seats), textiles, weaponry, and household goods. One room houses a collection of elaborate royal cradles from the 17th century.

Opened in 1767 and used actively until the 1830s, the eight-acre necropolis is enclosed by a high brick wall which protects the eclectic mix of tombs, cenotaphs, and mausoleums. The nearly 1900 graves represent a melting pot of design influences from European gothic to classical antiquity to Indo-Saracenic styles all jumbled up in a maze of obelisks, cairns, urns, and sarcophagi. A number of the graves belong to famous military and political figures of the time, including Sir William Jones, founder of the Asiatic Society, whose towering memorial obelisk is the tallest of the structures in the graveyard. While South Park Street Cemetery is undergoing constant upkeep and renovations, the rich tropical surroundings continue to encroach on the mouldering stones.

Spread over five districts, Nalgonda, Mahaboobnagar, Kurnool, Prakasam and Guntur, Nagarjunasagar is much more than a big cat sanctuary. Krishna River, the oldest river in the country, flows through 130 km of the reserve and its impressive reservoirs are vital sources of irrigation and energy for much of its state of residence. Practical uses aside, the river provides stunning views and waterfalls, kept constantly raging by two monsoon seasons that are active the majority of the year. Long before the site became a safe space for the animals, it stood as the ancient Buddhist town of Nagarjuna Viswa Vidyalayam, watched over by Buddhist scholar Nāgārjuna in 150 A.D. Ruins of the long-dead place of learning still scatter a section of the landscape, mixed in with 3rd century forts of the Kakatiya dynasty that line the banks of the Krishna. Renamed as Rajiv Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary in 1992, the sanctuary was was notified in 1978, becoming a ward of Project Tiger in 1983. At that time, the reserve had been being used as an exclusive hunting ground for royalty, and had been ravaged by poaching, fires, and general lack of conservation practices, leaving the tiger count at a meager 80 cats. Fire lines, salt licks, and several other improvements allowed that number to grow to 94 within 6 years, and while extremist activity in the area has made present numbers impossible to pin down, the sanctuary currently houses (among other animals) Bengal tigers, sloth Bears, Indian Pangolins, mugger crocodiles, Indian pythons, and Indian peafowl.",pangolins tigers endangered animals animals

The abandoned city is now dotted with hundreds of individual ruins, home to countless architectural wonders. Among the most beautiful ruins of Hampi are the pushkarnis, ancient water tanks. Like many Hindu temples in India, Hampi’s majestic temples have accompanying stepped tanks or basins used for religious and ceremonial purposes. Though thousands of miles away, water in the pushkarnis was considered part of the Ganges, Hinduism’s most sacred river, and therefore sacred. The pushkarnis all follow a similar architectural form, designed symmetrically as either rectangles or squares. Each generally has several large tiers which contain multiple steps in semi-pyramidal from, leading down to the next level. Many of the pushkarnis were surrounded by pillars, like those at the Pattabhirama Temple, all of which added to the sense of grandeur. These sacred tanks were integral parts of each temple complex. The stepped tanks were used for ritual bathing and cleansing before prayers. They also performed important ritualistic functions for festivals. At the end of Ganesh Chaturthi, the festival celebrating Ganesh, the idol of the god must be submerged in water in order to ritualistically dispose of it, a practice known as visarjan. The steps carved into the sides of each pushkarni allowed for worshippers to easily get in and out of the water. The pushkarnis were fed with the water of the nearby Tungabhadra River through a series of canals and aqueducts. While some, like the tank at the Krishna Temple, are no longer functional, others still receive some water through the ancient water systems.",wells temples infrastructure religion abandoned sacred spaces ruins architecture

From a distance, it looks like a golden sandcastle rising from the remote desert of western Rajasthan. But it is also a living fort, with about 3,000 inhabitants living within the complex. The Jaisalmer Fort is the second-oldest fort in the state of Rajasthan, and the oldest continuously inhabited fort in India. It was built on a hill in the 12th century by Rajput ruler Rawal Jaisal. The double-fortified ramparts and circular bastions are incorporated into the stunning architectural design for extra protection during defense and battle. Jaisalmer is on the edge of India, very near the Pakistan border, but it wasn’t always off the beaten path. Centuries ago, it was at the crossroads of several important trade routes, including the ancient Silk Road. Rich merchants built intricately carved havelis in the fort, adding to the beauty and charm of the “Golden City.” A paved road takes you from the city up a ramp into the fort, through four huge gateways to Dushera Chowk, presided over by the beautifully carved Palace of the Maharawal, the former home of the monarch. The palace was turned into a museum and visitors can wander among the painted and tiled rooms, and up to the roof, the highest point in the fort, which offers stunning views. The view from the Palace of the Maharawal, as well as other rooftops in Jaisalmer Fort, reveals the maze of narrow, twisting lanes that honeycomb through this ancient edifice. It’s a joy and delight to wander among them, letting yourself get lost. Residents share the confined space with several impressive Jain and Hindu temples, endless souvenir shops selling Rajasthani crafts such as puppets and textiles, guest houses and boutique hotels for every budget, cafes and restaurants, and, the fort museum itself. Jaisalmer Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site, part of a group of six hill forts in Rajasthan. But unlike most other forts, Jaisalmer is a living city that both preserves the past and thrives in the present.  Unfortunately, the tourist boom combined with water shortages in this desert location have added to the deterioration of the fort. Modern plumbing piped water into the fort, causing a leak that undermined the foundations. Several bastions collapsed and the fort was in jeopardy. Since then, conservation groups have repaired the damage, improved drainage, and fortified the structure, which though no longer in imminent jeopardy is still fragile.

When these institutions were established in the 19th century, they turned the stretch of road between Mahatma Gandhi Road crossing and Bowbazar crossing into a veritable haven for the city’s intelligentsia. With an area spanning almost one million square feet, College Street is also the largest secondhand book market in the world. The mile-long avenue is dotted with hundreds of bookstores, big and small, and is also home to India’s biggest publishing houses. The bookstores range from standard brick-and-mortar affairs to small makeshift stalls made from bamboo, canvas, or sheets of metal. Each stall and store has its own history to speak of. College Street’s main draw is that it boasts a collection of almost every single title to ever have been sold in Kolkata. Rare books are sold at dirt cheap prices, and extensive bargaining is the order of the day. One can find books dating back 250 years, rare first editions as well as copies of books from publishers that have ceased to exist today. One of the literati staples on College Street is the famed Indian Coffee House, which has seen notable Indian writers such as the likes of Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray stop in for a cup of chai, a samosa, and the weekly gossip.

However the island had a hidden advantage, in the middle of the fort was a well which supplied the fort with fresh non-salty drinking water. With water to drink and fish to eat, the island-fort was extremely difficult to conquer. For over 200 years, the Indian fisherman fought off attacks from invading Muslim armies, until a Trojan Horse-style raid – in which soldiers pretended to be liquor merchants, hid in barrels of booze and got the Koli soldiers drunk before attacking – by the Habashi finally overthrew the fisherman kings. When the British Empire expanded into India, the English tried to take the fort, but were also unsuccessful. The Brits signed a treaty with the Siddis – a Sufi Muslim group of African descent who received authority of the island from the Habashi – that the fort would remain under local rule, a sole independent outpost in all of colonial India. When India gained independence in 1947, the island was united with the state of Bombay. Open to tourists, the island is now accessible from either the Rajpuri port or the Murud port by sailboat. On the 22-acre island, the ancient forts and ruined castles can be explored, as can the islands beautiful beach.

For decades after its establishment in the 1950s, the Crafts Museum, despite its stunning collection of textiles, sculptures, and other handicrafts, was largely neglected. Since 2013, the museum has experienced a renaissance, thanks largely to the opening of its cafe. Nestled in the museum’s courtyard among replicated village scenes built by craftspeople from all over India, Cafe Lota serves hard-to-find regional specialties, using often-overlooked traditional grains to showcase the ingenuity of the country’s diverse cuisines. Upon entering the courtyard, visitors are greeted by rows of terra cotta horses, made by craftspeople especially for the museum. The horses guard a Village Complex, built in 1972 for the Asia Trade Fair and since relocated to the museum premises. Consisting of 15 different structures, including houses and shrines, the Village Complex was created by regional craftsmen using materials sourced from those areas. The courtyard walls showcase murals in indigenous styles from all over India, including a Mithila painting from Bihar and a painting from the indigenous Santhal people of Jharkand and West Bengal. Inside, visitors can see examples of the over 30,000 artifacts in the museum’s collection, including rare handwoven saris from the 19th century and gold and silver work. They can also look out for the museum’s artist residency for traditional craftspeople as well as periodic interactive sessions and cultural events, including dance and music performances. But the real star of the show is in the courtyard itself: Cafe Lota. Built to resemble a typical outdoor roadside restaurant or dhaba, the cafe is open-air, shaded by a roof of dried natural materials. The menu embodies the same authenticity, using local grains such as ragi or millet to re-create dishes from India’s vastly diverse regional cuisines. The menu includes traditional dishes such as Uttarakhand indigenous black bean curry with bhaang or hemp chutney (don’t worry: it’s not psychoactive) and playful fusion food, such as amaranth-crusted Amritsari-spiced “fish and chips.” In an increasingly standardized culinary culture, where industrial crops such as wheat and rice have overtaken traditional regional grains, Cafe Lota and the Crafts Museum remind visitors of the diversity and ingenuity of India’s farmers, craftspeople, and cooks.  The cafe is indoor-outdoor, with a natural ceiling and plenty of fans giving the space a breezy feel. The restaurant, however, doesn't have air conditioning, so the faint of heart (or sweat gland) may not be comfortable going at midday from May to July.

151,Karni Mata Temple,"Deshnok, India","Deep in the Thar desert, a temple crawling with thousands of holy rats.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karni-mata-temple,"According to legend, the rat temple near Bikaner dates back to the 1400s, when Karni Mata, an incarnation of the god Durga, asked the death-god Yoma to reincarnate the son of a grieving storyteller. When death refused to help, Karni Mata promised that all-male storytellers—members of the Charan caste—would be reincarnated as rats in her temple. When they die as rats, they are once more reincarnated as members of the Depavats family, as Karni Mata’s descendants are known. While the origins of rat-worship in India go back to the 15th century, the current temple, with its intricate marble panels and solid silver carvings, was built in the early 1900s to honor Karni Mata and her furry, reincarnated devotees. The temple has around 20,000 rats in residence, who are fed by members of the extended Depavats family—there are 513 Depavats families and devotees to Karni Mata. Though most of the temple-devotees work at the temple in shifts based on the lunar cycle, some families live in the temple permanently, taking care of the rats and sweeping the floor of excrement and food crumbs. The rats, known as “kabbas” or “little children,” are fed grains, milk, and coconuts shells from large metal bowls. Water the rats drink from is considered holy, and eating the rats’ leftovers is said to bring good fortune to those making the pilgrimage to the temple. The devotees have another reason to keep the rats safe and happy: according to the temple laws, if one of the rats is accidentally killed, it must be replaced with a rat made of silver or gold. But there is a bittersweet note to the whole affair. All the sweet foods, the fighting between rats, and the sheer number of animals living in the temple make them prone to diseases. Stomach disorders and diabetes are extraordinarily common among the rats, and every few years a rat epidemic decimates the population. Luckily, despite the dangers to the rats themselves, there are no recorded cases of humans contracting a disease from the temple rats. Shoes are not allowed in the temple, and it’s considered very auspicious for a rat to run over your feet, or for a visitor to glimpse an albino rat, of which there are only four or five out of the twenty thousand. To see the temple in full glory, visitors should come late at night or before sunrise, when the rats are out in full force, gathering food. Remember that only rats within the temple walls are thought to be reincarnated and therefore sacred. The rats in the town are just, well, rats.  A 40-minute drive south from Bikaner. One of the best occasions to visit the Temple is during the Karni Mata Fair. Also known as Karni Mata Festival or Karni Mate Mela is held twice a year from March-April, then from September-October. During the celebrations, the statue of the goddess Karni Mata is beautifully decorated with a golden crown, jewelry, and garlands.",rats rites and rituals temples sacred spaces animals
152,Gol Gumbaz,"Vijayapura, India",This 17th-century mausoleum is topped with an acoustic marvel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gol-gumbaz,"Gol Gumbaz is a fabulously imposing structure, towering 51 meters above the surrounding city of Vijayapura and representing one of the most important examples of late-medieval Indo-Islamic architecture. Meaning “circular dome”, it is appropriate that this mausoleum is most famous for its massive crowning feature — which is not only architecturally impressive, but also houses a sonic funhouse. With a diameter of 44 meters, the dome of Gol Gumbaz ranks among the largest domes of the pre-modern world and is supported by a series of interlocking arches without any columns. A balcony rings around the interior of the dome, creating the so-called “whisper gallery” where any sound, loud or quiet, is amplified and carried throughout the cavernous space, ringing off the concave walls and echoing back a dizzying number of times. In the dim twilight of the gallery’s interior, hovering 33 meters above the main chamber below, the effect is truly surreal. Gol Gumbaz was built as a mausoleum for Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, the seventh ruler of the Adil Shahi dynasty and head of the Bijapur sultanate. Construction began shortly after he ascended the throne in 1627 and apparently was not yet fully completed by the time he died in 1656, when work finally stopped. Its massive single chamber covers 1,700 square meters and sits atop a basement tomb containing the remains of sultan, as well as those of his two wives, his mistress, his daughter and his grandson. Each corner of the building is graced by a seven-story-tall minaret containing stairs that provide access to the whispering gallery.

153,Nahoum and Sons,"Kolkata, India","This Jewish bakery, among the last in the region, sells legendary sweets from a century-old storefront.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nahoum-sons-kolkata-jewish-bakery,"At the turn of the 20th century, Nahoum Israel Mordecai moved from the Middle East to Kolkata. He was part of a community of more than 4,000 other Jewish people from Syria and Iraq, called Baghdadi Jews, who had flourished along trade routes in India since the Mughal Empire. They brought their faith, their culture, and, in some cases, their talent for baking. Nahoum was one of the community’s most talented confectioners. In 1902, he began selling baked goods and cheese door to door. In 1916, he formally opened Nahoum and Sons bakery. More than a century later, the dark wood counter of Nahoum and Sons’ original New Market location continues to groan under the weight of sweets. Bengalis are famous sweet makers and eaters, and their milk-based mishti are a dream of sweet syrups and fried dairy. Nahoum and Sons’ sweets are a bit different than conventional Bengali fare, mixing Western staples such as brownies and cream puffs with Jewish and Middle Eastern confections, such as challah bread and baklava. Some sweets at Nahoum’s, such as savory caraway cookies known as kakas, are signatures of the Baghdadi Jewish community. Others, like the bakery’s coconut and cheese samosas, are pure fusion, the result of a marriage of traditions and flavors common to this once-colonial capital. Today, Nahoum and Sons is one of Kolkata’s last Jewish cultural institutions. The city’s Jewish community has dwindled to around 20 people. Many of Kolkata’s Jews fled following independence in 1947, uncertain what an independent India would bring. Meanwhile, the 2013 death of the founder’s grandson had loyalists wondering whether the bakery would be shut for good. Luckily, another family member took over the business, and it remains strong. Tradition has served the bakery well over the years: Although owners just recently began accepting credit cards, they continue to use the wooden money till that has collected dough (of the financial kind) for the past hundred years. Even though the community’s numbers have declined significantly, Nahoum and Sons remains a testimony to the pluralistic history of India. One slice of the bakery’s lemon tart, and you’ll understand why this institution has weathered the test of time.  Nahoum's is popular among sweet-lovers year round, but perhaps never so much as before Christmas. Head to New Market a few days before the holiday to witness (and indulge in) a sugary rush. Be sure to indulge in a bit of Nahoum's famous fruitcake—the Archbishop of Canterbury said it's the best he's ever had.",bakery jewish sweets
154,Netaji Shubash Chandra Bose Island,"South Andaman, India",An abandoned settlement originally established by British colonialists in the Andaman archipelago.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ross-island,"Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep Island, also formerly known as the Ross Island, was originally set up as the residential headquarters for the British administration of the Indian Penal Settlement in the Andaman Islands, Ross Island is now abandoned entirely. The residential structures remain, old houses, a church, a bazaar, stores, a large swimming pool, and a small hospital, though their brick is slowly being overtaken by the roots of wild Ficus plants. The island was named after surveyor, Sir Daniel Ross, and was inhabited initially in 1788-89 after Archibald Blair’s survey of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Owing to inclement weather conditions, however, the mortality rate was very high and the settlement was soon abandoned. In 1887 it was repopulated, following a resolution to set up a jail and penal colony there under British administration, following a number of uprisings by Indians. The island was continuously inhabited and controlled by the British until March 1942, when Japanese troops invaded and took control of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands including Ross. Remnants of bunkers constructed by the Japanese remain. When WWII came to a close, the island was once again under the control of the British and following the independence of India, was transferred to the Indian government. Ross Island was uninhabited by either Japanese or British at that time and remained so until 1979 when the island was handed over to the Indian Navy. A small base named INS Jarawa was subsequently established. In 1993, a museum was also set up on the island. Today the island is open to visitors, and contains several brick walkways crisscrossing the settlement. They’re a number of small shops with water and food supplies, and ferries run every hour or so from Port Blair, the main outpost of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. As it is also a navy controlled territory, visitors are required to sign-in upon entry and exit, and the island is closed to tourists at night.

155,Fatehpur Sikri,"Fatehpur Sikri, India","An imperial fortress city that incorporated cultural elements from the entire Mughal empire, only to be abandoned the year it was finished.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fatehpur-sikri,"This magnificent and abandoned fortified city of Fatehpur Sikri was built for the Mughal Emperor Akbar. It was the capital of the Mughal empire from 1571 to 1585, and is considered the best example of Mughal architecture in existence. Akbar himself oversaw the construction of the fortress, ensuring that every detail of the city was befitting of an emperor’s grandeur. Unfortunately, the fortress was abandoned as soon as it was finished. The grand city was comprised of several palatial courts, a harem building, a mosque, private emperor’s quarters, residential buildings, the tomb of a Sufi saint, a giant outdoor board game, a pool, and utility buildings. These were colored a rosy hue by the local red sand used as construction material. Fatehpur Sikri is also notable for the fact that it incorporated the many cultures of the Mughal empire—the name, as well as the geometric layout, drew on ancient Persian influences, whereas the buildings’ decorative embellishments were classically Indian. Akbar was known for his tolerance of multi-religious culture, and the inhabitants of the city followed Islam, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity without conflict. Not long after the fortress was completed, the lake that provided water to the complex dried up, and life at Fatehpur Sikri was unsustainable. Emperor Muhammad Shah lived in the city between 1719 and 1748, and the Marathas warriors occupied the city for a short time after that. Once the British invaded India, their army used the fortress as a barracks, during which time it was badly damaged. What remains of Fatehpur Sikri is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A town has grown up to the west of the ruins, and still uses the mosque for worship. Archaeological excavation has indicated that the significance of the site dates way earlier than Emperor Akbar and Fatehpur Sikri. Thousand-year-old Jain statues and buildings have been unearthed beneath the city, suggesting that some lost culture existed there prior to the Mughals. One of the intriguing structures at Fatehpur Sikri is known as Panch Mahal. Panch Mahal means “five-story high royal pavilion”.  As the name suggests, it consists of a five-story frame pavilion made of red sandstone. The open floor plan allows it to serve as a transition building between the traditional masonry structure on one side and an open plaza on the other. Panch Mahal‘s frame structure and open-plan became a part of modernist architect Le Corbusier’s architectural grammar.  Panch Mahal’s contribution as a precursor to modern architecture is not often recognized in the History of Architecture.  However, it must be recognized as a pioneer of modernism in architecture.",empire hinduism islam unesco fortresses cities colonialism ghost towns medieval abandoned
156,Kapaleeshwarar Temple,"Chennai, India",The painted and decorated towers of this Hindu shrine were once the tallest structures in one of the oldest cities in India.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kapaleeshwarar-temple,"The coastal south Indian city of Chennai is one of the oldest in the country, part of the Madras Presidency during British rule. But Mylapore, a neighborhood of Chennai, even predates the city itself, with historical records from the area dating back to the first century BCE. Mylapore derives its name from the Tamil word mayil, meaning peacock, from a time when dancing peacocks were a common sight there. Today the peacocks have been replaced by motor vehicles, and maritime traders replaced by modern commercial establishments. But Mylapore still stands, as does its cultural and religious center, the Kapaleeshwarar temple. The temple is a shrine to the Hindu god Shiva and his consort Parvati and is one the of the busiest in the city, drawing both pilgrims and tourists. The original temple was constructed by rulers of the Pallava dynasty, and was located closer to the seashore. After that was destroyed, the current temple was built over 300 years ago in the traditional architectural style that includes a gopuram or a painted and intricately carved tower gateway, a central shrine surrounded by smaller ones, and a massive temple tank. The tank, whose walls are painted in the holy colors of red and white, has a central platform around which a barge makes its way during the annual festival of Thai Poosam, which celebrates the season’s abundant rainfall that fills the tank. Another major festival is the Arubathimoovar, where the temple’s deities and saints are placed on decorated chariots and taken in procession around the temple. Mylapore, always buzzing with activity, transforms into a whirlwind of faces, flowers, food, and music during the annual festivals. The temple and tank are surrounded by four streets that are, today, home to both big stores and small stalls selling flowers and knick-knacks. The maada streets, as they’re called locally, are a good place to pick up traditional clothes and jewelry, and artifacts made of silver and brass. The small chaotic side streets are also full of local outlets serving snacks like pakodas or vegetable fritters, polis or sugar-coated crepes, and the trademark extra-strong filter coffee. A walk around Mylapore is a great way to experience the ethos of an ancient south Indian temple and the commerce and ecosystem that surround it. Mylapore and the temple are easily accessible by road, though parking can be a problem around the temple. Men who drive the local black and yellow autos are very familiar with the area and can be directed using terms like 'Mylapore Tank' and 'Kabali kovil'.

157,Adalaj Ni Vav,"Adalaj, India",A deeply beautiful 15th-century stepwell with a tragic story.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adalaj-ni-vav,"Adalaj ni vav (stepwells are called vavs in the Indian state of Gujarat) is a beautiful structure, descending five stories deep. It was built in 1499 to hold water, provide refuge to travelers and local people, and offer spiritual sustenance. The fifth floor is especially stunning, and from here you can see the deep turquoise waters of the well itself, which seems to glow with inner light, surrounded by astonishing beauty captured forever in stone. The stepwell’s immense beauty is not the only thing spectacular about it. The tale of its creation is full of love and war, devotion and betrayal. Hindu King Rana Veer Singh started construction of the Adalaj ni vav to provide relief to his people in this arid region, who had to walk miles for water. However, before it was finished, he entered into a war with neighboring Muslim King Mehmud Begada. King Rana Veer Singh was killed in battle, and King Mehmud Begada fell in love with his widow, the beautiful Queen Roopba (aka Queen Rudabai). Queen Roopba agreed to marry King Mehmud Begada—but only on the condition that he finish the stepwell her husband had started. King Mehmud Begada agreed, which is why the stepwell design—built in Solanki style of architecture and adorned with Hindu and Jain images—also shows Islamic influences. When it was finished, Queen Roopba threw herself in to the well, and died. Apparently, she had no intention of marrying King Mehmud—she just wanted to see her husband’s stepwell finished. Luckily for us, King Mehmud did not destroy the structure or the Hindu ornamentation, and it remains intact more than 500 years later. The entire structure is covered with carvings, sculptures, and ornamentation, combining Indo-Islamic architectural elements and designs. Islamic floral patterns blend seamlessly with Hindu and Jain symbolism, and carved scenes of everyday life, such as women churning butter. Hindu and Jain gods also adorn the walls, and to this day, the stepwell serves as a temple. It’s not uncommon to see flower offerings. Adalaj ni vav is unique in that it is the only stepwell with three sets of entrance stairs. They all meet on the first level down, at a large square platform. As you continue to descend, down to the fifth story, the air grows noticeably cooler. The stepwell was built to keep the harsh sunlight out, and provide a cool refuge for local people and travelers. There is a lot of room for people to gather on each level, and no doubt travelers would have spent the night here—back in the days before hotels. The small town of Adalaj was on a trade route, and would have seen many travelers pass by.  Adalaj Ni Vav is in Adalaj village, near Gandhinagar, Gujarat state capital, and about 18 kilometres from Ahmedabad, Gujarat's largest city. You can either take a taxi, take an auto-rickshaw, or catch a bus for Gandhinagar. The stepwell is open from 6 am to 6 pm, and there is an entry fee of Rs. 25 (US$ 0.35) for Indian and SAARC nationals, and of Rs. 300 (US$4) for other nationals.",stepwells hinduism wells architecture

A living temple on the grounds attracts religious pilgrims; nature lovers enjoy the beauty of the landscape; and history buffs are drawn to the ruins of a 10th century fort, a colossal citadel founded in 944 by the Chauhan Rajputs. The land occupied by the national park was once used by the Rajput rulers of Jaipur as private hunting grounds. Today, the crumbling Ranthambore Fort in the center of the park is an attraction of its own, set dramatically on a sheer cliff on Thambhore Hill, and surrounded by a verdant forest dotted with decaying pavilions, palaces, lakes, and ponds. The majestic fort is situated atop a 700-foot-high hill, bounded by an enormous stone wall inset with bastions and turrets. It extends over 4 miles and encloses an area of nearly 2.5 miles. Inside, the complex is filled with many ruins and architectural marvels. Palaces, cenotaphs, tanks, pavilions, and temples are scattered among a network of lanes and courtyards. It is considered a fine example of a forest hill fort, and the remains of the Hammir palace are among the oldest Indian surviving palaces. Though the Ranthambore Fort was believed an impregnable defense in its time, the citadel was attacked twice. It was stormed by Sultan Alauddin Khilji’s army in 1299, because the Chauhan King, Hammir Deo, gave shelter to one of the sultan’s enemies. Even though Khilji sent 80,000 cavalry and a large infantry to attack the fort, they were repulsed, and their commander was killed. In 1568, Mughal Emperor Akbar lead a massive attack on the fort, with about 70,000 troops. As Rajputs were often sworn enemies of the Mughals, the emperor had captured several other Rajput forts in Rajasthan. After a siege of more than a month, Hindu leader Rai Surjan Hada of Ranthambore Fort surrendered to the Emperor Akbar. Today, the site is open to park visitors on wildlife safaris or those who come to see the fort alone. It’s possible to drive a private car to the fort parking lot and walk about 200 steps up to the top of the hill. From there, the expansive views of the park are magnificent, and you can see soaring vultures, eagles, and other birds at virtually eye level.  The fort can be visited during a wildlife safari to Ranthambore National Park, between October to June. The park is open to visitors between 6:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and between 2 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Admission to the fort (though not the national park) is free.",forts national parks temples ancient ruins animals history
160,Sati Handprints,"Jodhpur, India",Fifteen Jodhpur queens left their handprints before going to their fiery death.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sati-handprints,"The entrance to the imposing Mehrangarh Fort is guarded by a series of seven famous gates. To the left of innermost gate, Loha Pol, or “Iron Gate”, are 15 small handprints left by the wives of the maharaja before they immolated themselves on his funeral pyre. Known as sati marks, the gilded handprints most likely date back to the 1843 death of Maharaja Man Singh. The custom of sati has ancient origins in the Hindu faith, and was practiced widely in the Rajasthan area. Wives were dressed in wedding finery to join their husbands in death as an act of devotion and faith, usually within a day of his death. In 1731, following the death of Maharaja Ajit Singh six wives and fifty-eight concubines placed themselves in the funeral fires. The practice horrified early western colonials, and it was outlawed by the British in 1829, but was not officially condemned by the Indian government until 1987 when they passed the Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, in the wake of a well publicized sati death. The last recorded case of sati in Jodhpur was in 1953. Overlooking Jodhpur as the home of maharajas since 1458, the Meghrangarh Fort has a particularly bloody history, starting with a curse placed during the construction by a hermit who had been living on the mountain. Irritated at being ousted, legend states that he cursed the builder, Maharaja Roa Jodha with threats of drought. To appease the hermit, Jodha built him other nearby accommodations. He then took the further precaution of burying a local man alive in the foundation. In exchange for his life, his descendants are cared for to this day by the state. Other stories from the fort’s history underscore a legacy of violence, primarily taking advantage of the extraordinary height of the fortress: 120 foot walls perch 400 feet over the valley below. Gravity played its gristly part in the death of a prince’s mistress, hurled from a window, a Prime Minister pushed from the ramparts, and Maharaja Rao Ganga’s opium fueled tragic accidental fall. In September of 2008, the bloody history was added to when a stampede at one of the fort’s shrines left 249 people dead, and several more injured. Most of the fort visible today dates from the mid 1600s, and throughout its history various rulers have left their mark on the architecture. Inside the fort opulently furnished palaces include a hall of mirrors, an armory, and displays of the trapping of the Maharajas such as turbans, palanquins, and ceremonial gold and silver elephant howdas (saddles).",memento mori

Once on the verge of utter ruin, Sunder Burj, meaning “beautiful tower,” is now part of a UNESCO-certified heritage complex witnessing a renaissance in public interest. The newly restored Sunder Burj is situated at the main entrance to Sunder Nursery, the city’s first arboretum, established in the early 20th century. There are also approximately 15 other historical monuments within the complex, including the Lakkarwala Burj, the Mughal Tomb, and Mirza Muzaffar Hussain’s tomb. Extensive conservation work has been carried out on the mausoleums, keeping in mind the preservation of their architectural integrity. From structural repairs to environmental conservation, it took over 10 years to restore the historic necropolis to its former glory. The restoration of Sunder Burj’s ceiling alone required considerable time and effort. The ceiling, now radiant in the honeyed light of an autumn afternoon, had suffered extensive damage due to water seepage and shoddy repair work conducted previously. Trained craftsmen worked tirelessly to restore the decorative plasterwork of the domed ceiling and repair the cracks in the mausoleum’s walls and latticed screens. In landscape design, the conservationists sought inspiration from the formally arranged gardens of the Mughal era. The grand central vista, with its verdant gardens, running canals, flower beds, and sandstone seating, offers sweeping views of the complex.

Although the tree at Mahabodhi is considered a cutting from the original tree and in the original meditation location, a number of other cuttings exist around the world and are also frequently visited by Buddhist pilgrims. Besides the sacred tree and temple, the area is similarly dotted with Buddhist relics, marking the locations where Buddha reflected on his enlightenment. One of the most prominent sites is the unblinking stupa, which stands in front of the tree.

164,Iron Pillar of Delhi,"New Delhi, India",An ancient iron pillar in Delhi that seems to be rustproof.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iron-pillar-delhi,"On first appearance it doesn’t look like much–a 22 foot tall iron pillar, slowly rusting away in the middle of an empty square in Delhi, India. The surprise comes in learning its age, some 1600 years old, much older than one would expect for an iron column which, judging from other exposed iron, should have turned to a pile of dust long ago. It was this “enigma” which lead some people to include the Iron Ashoka pillar in a group of objects known as OOPArt’s or “out of place artifacts.” These objects are said to be in some way unreasonably futuristic for their time, as if they had come from another place and time. Some among these “out of place” artifacts have been shown to be outright hoaxes, such as the “Coso Artifact” a spark plug said to found embedded in a chunk of rock 500,000 years old. In fact it was a 1920s Champion spark plug which had developed a shell of iron oxide concretion rust around it. Some discoveries have turned out to be a case of underestimating the technological capabilities of people past, such as the antikythera mechanism – an ancient mechanical computer from 100 B.C.—which is known to be both real, and previously to its being discovered, would have been seen as an anachronism. Happily, the Iron Ashoka Pillar of Delhi falls in the second category. Despite being classed with items like the Coso Artifact, and though much was made of its 99.9999% iron purity so pure no one knew how they cast it, (in actually it is only 98% pure), of “ancient and lost” techniques in metallurgy, and of suggestions that it was made of some sort of futuristic or non-earthly metal abounded, in fact the column is much closer to the antikythera mechanism. It is a simple example of the exquisite craft and knowledge of ancient peoples. Ninety eight percent pure wrought iron, the column is a absolute testament to the high level of skill achieved by ancient Indian ironsmiths. It would have had to been made using a coal heated furnace to even create a heat hot enough to achieve forge welding, where two or more pieces of metal were hammered together. However, it has avoided corrosion from the rains, winds and temperature fluctuations over the last 1600 years, not through a conscience effort or magical metallurgy technique on the parts of the pillar’s creators, but through the accidental formation of a “passive protective film.” This film was created by accident through a complicated combination of the lack of lime in the furnaces used to make the iron pillar, the presence of raw slag and unreduced iron in the pillar, and the wetting and drying cycles of the weather. All of which helped to create a 1/20th of a millimeter thick layer of “misawite,”on the pillar. Misawite is a compound of iron, oxygen and hydrogen which does not rust. It seems rather than chalk up the pillar to ancient astronauts, or alien metallurgy, it is enough to recognize the skill involved in creating a six ton, 22 foot high iron pillar, some 1600 years ago.",long now locations hoaxes and pseudoscience retro-tech instruments of science inventions
165,Neemrana Baori,"Neemrana, India","This abandoned stepwell is one of the largest, deepest, and certainly one of the creepiest in India.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/neemrana-baori,"The bland approach to Neemrana stepwell doesn’t give even the slightest hint of what a visitor is about to encounter. You proceed into the little town of Neemrana, turn right at a featureless corner, drive a few hundred yards down a narrow strip of tarmac, and pull over near a plain stone wall. Careful as you start walking; the view that slowly unfolds is hard to process. There’s a huge manmade chasm where the ground is meant to be, and this unexpected canyon is so deep and so long that its exact size is impossible to fathom. When steps—lots of them—appear, their descent is nearly vertical, and the prospect of stumbling is truly alarming. In fact, anyone with acrophobia, stay away. Welcome to Neemrana baori! This is a subterranean stepwell, regionally known as baori, baoli, bawadi, and vav. It’s a unique type of water-harvesting structure, thousands of which were built throughout India starting around 600 CE. They were perhaps the most significant and multi-functional buildings of their day, primarily providing water year-round. Marvels of architecture, engineering, and art, stepwells guaranteed access to the precious resource, but at Neemrana, for instance, the groundwater was buried so deeply underground that nearly 200 steps were required to reach it during dry seasons. Then, when the monsoons arrived, the water level rose, the steps submerged, and the cycle of dramatic fluctuation repeated. Unfortunately, their past prominence was no guarantee of a noteworthy future, and stepwells slid off history’s grid. Today, most are entirely unknown to the world, even within India where they should be right up there with forts, palaces, tombs, and temples as sites for tourists to throng. The advent of the British Raj, modern water pumps, and plumbing all rendered stepwells obsolete and, untethered from their main purpose, the vast majority became dilapidated, anonymous, filthy, and almost always heartbreaking. Located just a few kilometers off the busy Delhi/Jaipur highway, Neemrana Baori is among the most impressive stepwells in India by virtue of being one of the largest, deepest, and certainly one of the creepiest. There’s an overwhelming sense of abandonment to the place, its broken ledges, dangerously cracked steps, garbage, and graffiti all testaments to its profound neglect. There are precariously hanging bee nests under the eaves, and bats take up residence in the dark corridors. India’s green parakeets flit around, but even their noisy presence can’t dispel the palpably forlorn ambiance here. It’s nearly inexplicable that something so extraordinary (not to mention humungous) as Neemrana appears on no itinerary, in no guidebook, or in the accepted canon of architecture. Such is the case with nearly all stepwells, and only a relative handful are cared for, with one, Rani ki Vav in Gujarat, miraculously earning UNESCO World Heritage status in 2014. But there is such an absence of factual information about most of them that scholars often can’t agree when a stepwell was constructed or who built it, as is the case with Neemrana, which has been ascribed to three separate centuries. The rampant decay may have diminished Neemrana’s magnificence, but it certainly hasn’t destroyed it. This was a welcoming, awe-inspiring, life-giving oasis for centuries of villagers, caravans, and pilgrims who could rest in the cool alcoves, fetch water, hunker down for days away from the hot sun. It may be clinging to life, but it still has the power to awe. Victoria Lautman is an arts and culture journalist with a focus on India.

166,Mahakali Caves,"Mumbai, India",Nineteen ancient rock-cut Buddhist caves can be found on the outskirts of Mumbai.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mahakali-caves,"Beautifully carved out of black basalt rock, the Mahakali Caves just outside Mumbai are one of the few places in the world to see ancient cave dwellings within the borders of a bustling metropolis. These rock-cut caves have existed since the ancient Ashoka Empire, used by Buddhist monks as dwellings and meditation chambers as much as 2,000 years ago. There are 19 caves in total, believed to have been carved between the first and sixth centuries. There are also several cisterns cut from the same rock. Most of the caves are simple and small, with minimal carvings or ornamentation—stark chambers were used as dwellings for the monks and a place to meditate. The exception is the chaitya, the main Buddhist shrine and prayer hall, which is adorned with stupas and large carved statues of Buddha idols. Some of the cave walls have scriptures carved in Pali, a language considered older even than Sanskrit. Strangely, the modern name of these Buddhist caves, Mahakali, refers to the Hindu goddess Kali. This is something of a misnomer, and likely comes from the fact that there is a Hindu temple to Kali nearby. The site is also known as the Kondivite Caves, after the nearby Kondivite village. Interestingly, one of the stupas originally erected as a Buddhist monument is now revered as a Hindu lingam statue.  The Mahakali Caves are located in the Andheri East suburb of Mumbai. From Mumbai, take the train to Andheri Railway Station or Jogeshwari Railway Station, or there are several bus lines that will drop you close by. The site is open every day from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Many of the low-lying rock caves have collapsed over the centuries or have been poorly maintained and are in a state of disrepair. The Archaeological Survey of India and the Committee on Caves are making efforts to protect the caves from encroaching human development.",meditation monks buddhism caves ancient ecosystems
167,Gandhi Smriti,"New Delhi, India",Time has stopped at the house where Gandhi died.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gandhi-smriti,"Gandhi Smriti, or “Gandhi Remembrance”, is the house and gardens where Mahatma Gandhi spent the last 144 days of his life before he was killed on January 30, 1948. The house, which was owned by the Birla family, was converted to a memorial museum in the 1970s. Its curators have preserved and recreated the circumstances of the estate at the time of Gandhi’s death, right down to the time. Gandhi’s pocket watch, which was stopped at the time of his death, 5:17 p.m., now hangs on the wall for all to see. Visitors can tour the sparse room where Gandhi stayed, where all of his belongings remain intact. A set of footprints recreates his final walk to the veranda where he was shot and killed. It was at this veranda that Gandhi led nightly prayers in front of a mass congregation. This space also houses the Martyr’s Column, commemorating the exact site of his death.",activism houses homes museums history
168,Sulabh Museum of Toilets,"New Delhi, India",Made by a man on a worldwide sanitation crusade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sulabh-museum-of-toilets,"Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak is a man of vision. It just so happens that his particular vision heavily involves toilets. But while it may at first glance appear to be just a “quirky” museum, the Sulabh Museum of Toilets gets to the heart a very real health problem in India. The lack of proper plumbing and access to modern toilet facilities lead to the death of some half a million children every year due to dehydration caused by open defecation. With a battle cry of “No body should go outside for defecation and every house in India should have a toilet” Pathak has set about bringing modern sanitation to India and raising the status of India’s lowest caste the “untouchables.” A small part of the so called “Sulabh Sanitation Movement” the museum of toilets in New Delhi serves to “educate students about the historical trends in the development of toilet… and help sanitation experts learn from the past and solve problems in the sanitation sector.” Among the unusual toilets in the museums collection is a toilet that burns excrement into ash, a toilet disguised as a pile of books and a replica throne/toilet for French king Louis XIV so he could hear kingly business while doing his kingly business.

169,Bara Imambara,"Lucknow, India",This magnificent 18th-century hall consists of a maze of nearly a thousand interconnected passages.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bara-imambara,"The magnificent Bara Imambara in the north Indian city of Lucknow was built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab of Awadh, as a major famine relief project. The massive central hall of the imambara (a Shia Muslim meeting hall) is considered to be the largest arched hall in the world built without any kind of external support from wooden, iron, or stone beams. The trick that keeps the ceiling from crashing in on visitors is also the imambara’s most intriguing architectural feature, the bhulbhulaiya, a labyrinthine network of nearly a thousand interconnected passageways built directly above the chambers, thus reducing the weight of the ceiling by making it hollow. Loosely translated as “maze” in Hindi, the bhulbhulaiya is impossible for visitors to navigate without a guide. Apart from the hall and the maze, the Bara Imambara complex also consists of a large freestanding mosque known as the Asafi Mosque, sprawling courtyards, ornate gateways, and a baoli or stepwell. The most spectacular gateway is the Rumi Darwaza with its scalloped arch, which serves as the west entrance to the complex and a portal to the city’s storied past. During the period of Mughal rule in India, the emperors appointed nawabs, or viceroys, to undertake the administration of various provinces within their territory. Awadh was one such province and the nawabs of Awadh, hailing from Nishapur in Iran, left an indelible mark on the city of Lucknow, the administrative capital, through their art, culture, architecture, and Shi’ite religious traditions. When famine struck the area in the late 18th century and lasted for a decade, nawab Asaf-ud-Daula embarked on the project of building an imambara to provide employment as construction workers to his suffering subjects. Neither a mosque nor a mausoleum, an imambara is a unique edifice used by Shia Muslims for the purpose of religious gatherings during the month of Muharram. Muharram marks the festival of ritualized mourning for the third imam and Muhammad’s grandson Hussain who was martyred in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. Unmatched in its architectural opulence, the Bara Imambara, also known as the Asfi Imambara after its founder, comes alive during the festival of Muharram as believers assemble and take out taziyas, or movable shrines. The Rumi Darwaza opens onto a vast courtyard ending at a triple-arched gateway, which further leads to the main courtyard wherein lies the great imambara. The exterior façade of the imambara is monumental in scale and affords views of the city of Lucknow from multiple levels. Notice the fishes facing each other engraved on the squinches of the gateways, part of the royal insignia of the Awadhi nawabs. The central hall of the imambara, measuring 165 feet in length and 53 feet in width, is an astonishing feat of architecture due to its vaulted ceiling which stands at a height of 50 feet without any supporting pillars or beams. Its walls painted in a soothing combination of pistachio green and white and crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the main hall houses the tombs of the nawab and his talented architect from Delhi, Kifayat-ullah, their graves lying adjacent to each other. The entire structure of the imambara is divided into nine chambers, with eight smaller chambers surrounding the main hall. The space above these chambers was cleverly repurposed into a labyrinthine network of interconnecting passages, accessed through 489 identical doorways and the layout collectively known as the “bhulbhulaiya.”  The complex is open from sunrise to sunset and entry is ticketed. Travelers are strongly cautioned not to venture into the maze without the help of a guide.",mazes arches islam history architecture

The Sun Temple is a Hindu temple constructed after 1026 CE, during the Chaulukya dynasty. The complex was designed in the Māru-Gurjara style. Unlike other tourist destinations around the country, this temple isn’t usually overrun with tourists, which adds to its appeal. The temple was constructed in such a way that during every equinox, the first sunrays would fall on a diamond placed on the Sun God’s head. The temple was dedicated to the solar deity Surya. The Sabha Mandap stands on 52 pillars that were designed to depict the 52 weeks of the year. Carvings of the sun, along with its unity of four other elements—air, water, earth, and space—can be spotted along the walls of the temple.

171,Guru Sweet Mart,"Mysore, India","At this sweet shop, the descendants of a royal chef serve up the fudge-like dessert his ancestor invented for a king.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guru-sweet-mart-mysore-pak,"Maharaja Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the 19th-century king of South India’s Mysore Kingdom, was bored. He had a serious sweet tooth, but he’d grown tired of the creations of the royal kitchen. He told his cook, Kakasura Madappa, to create something new. In response to the directive, Madappa created a fudge-like concoction called Mysore pak. More than a century later, Madappa’s descendants continue to sell Mysore pak from their Mysore-based shop, Guru Sweet Mart. At first, Mysore pak—made from a deceptively simple combination of sugar syrup, chickpea flour, and ghee—may not seem like a royal creation. Consider Guru Sweet Mart’s modest layout: While the storefront display is stacked high with multicolored milk-based sweets, the Mysore pak is often kept in crates on the floor. But that’s not because the sweet is unwanted. It’s because the store’s proprietors have maintained such an elevated level of Mysore pak-making, their creation simply can’t stay on the shelves. While small stores across South India sell mediocre Mysore pak that can be either too wet or unpleasantly chalky, Guru Sweet Mart’s version is the antidote to uninspiring imitators: soft, with a toasty ghee smell and a lusciously melty mouthfeel. It is also an instant sugar rush you will feel in your veins. The three brothers who currently run the shop, Kumar, Natraj and Shivananda, along with their cousin, Guru Prasad, keep the small storefront fragrant with fresh Mysore pak brought from their home kitchen several times a day. While they fiercely protect the recipe for their sweet, they have revealed that they clarify their own butter and grind the chickpea flour in their kitchen. At the base of it all is a simple syrup, made of sugar and water, which, in the Kannada language, is called pak. It’s still debated whether Kakasura Madappa or the king himself gave the dish its signature name, combining the name of the sugar syrup with the kingdom. What is certain, however, is that Madappa’s family continues to honor its legacy by churning out a gooey, toasty creation fit for a king.  For an iconic (if chaotic) local experience, head to Guru Sweet Mart on the morning of Dussehra, a Hindu holiday in the fall that celebrates the victory of the god Ram over the demon Ravan. The shop is sure to be full of locals attempting to stock up on Mysore pak for the holiday.",india sweets candy stores royalty
172,Bibi Ka Maqbara,"Aurangabad, India",Half-size replica of the Taj Mahal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bibi-ka-maqbara,"Many replicas of great buildings are comically small, or they are built in a kitschy fashion almost mocking the original. The Bibi Ka Maqbara in Maharashtra, India does neither of those things. It is itself a grand maqbara, meaning “holy tomb” in Arabic, with inlaid walls and marble screens, surrounded by turrets and a reflecting pool. But it is small compared to the inspiration, theTaj Mahal in Agra, over 1000 miles to the north. Known as the “poor man’s Taj Mahal” or the “mini Taj”, like the original it is a monument built in memory of love lost. In this case it was a mother’s love, rather than a wife’s, that inspired Prince Azam Shah to build the structure between 1651 and 1661. The mini Taj was erected less than 30 years after the original, composed of slightly more modest building materials, with limestone and plaster as well as marble under the all-marble onion dome. Marble was abundant in northern India, near Jaipur where the Taj Mahal was built. In order to build the Bibi Ka Maqbara, the marble had to hauled on carts to the new capital of the Mughal empire. The construction took only 6 years, compared to the 22 years for the Taj Mahal. The grounds cover 458 x 275 meters of gardens. At the center of the building is the lone tomb of Rabia-ul-Daurani, third wife of the emperor, and mother of the architect. It may lack some of the staggering size and grandeur of the original, but it does not attract the millions of visitors, or the strict guards who threaten to remove the film from the cameras if you dare take a picture. The mini-Taj exudes its own more humble charm.  From Mumbai: There are two trains daily from Mumbai to Aurangabad daily.",small worlds and model towns miniatures memento mori
