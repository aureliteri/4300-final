0,The Swallow's Nest,"Haspra, Crimea",A castle perched precariously over the Crimean Sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-swallows-nest-haspra-crimea,"Perched on the edge of the Crimean Sea is not perhaps where one would look to find a Neo-Gothic castle. However, the Swallow’s Nest proves the exception to the rule. Constructed on the top of the Aurora cliff overlooking the sea, outside of the town of Gaspra, it stands as a curious remnant of Imperial Russia. The original structure on the property was a small wooden cottage that was constructed at the behest of a Russian General around 1895. However, several years later the cottage was placed in the ownership of A.K. Tobin, a physician at the Imperial Court and doctor to the Tsar. The cottage again changed hands, this time being purchased by Baron von Stiengel who demolished the original cottage and replaced it with the Neo-Gothic manor that still stands to this day. Although it is classified architecturally as a castle, it is not a castle in the truest sense of the word. It was not built to house and protect its occupants, with the turrets and battlements being more for show than any practical application. When one first looks at the Swallow’s Nest it is hard not to marvel at the simple physics of the structure. It is built literally on the edge of the cliff with parts of the balconies and patios actually extending beyond the rock face, jutting into thin air. The whole building looks as though it could at a moment’s notice topple over into the Crimean Sea. This being said, the Swallow’s Nest has survived a large earthquake (6-7 on the Richter scale) that struck the region in 1927. Although the building itself was not badly damaged the underlying rock was. The cliff itself developed a large vertical crack as a result of the quake and the Swallow’s Nest was closed for more than four decades because it was deemed structurally unsafe. In 1968, renovations began on the building in an attempt to make it habitable—or at least visitable. Engineers inserted a large concrete plate into the cliff that helped shore up the crack that was left by the quake. In 1975 an Italian restaurant opened in the castle and has operated on its premises ever since. Because of its inspiring location the castle was used in the exterior shots of multiple Soviet films.",cliffs eccentric homes castles homes architecture
1,Eski-Kermen Cave Town,"Bakhchisaray, Crimea","One of the cave cities of Crimea, built by the Goths in the sixth century.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eskikermen-cave-town,"The cave towns of Crimea are a series of naturally formed limestone caves that were expanded and strengthened for use as dwellings and fortresses during the Middle Ages by various tribal groups. Located in the southwest corner of Crimea, these cave cities are a fascinating example of the local population creatively repurposing what nature supplies into something unique and useful. Eski-Kermen is one of the earliest inhabited of the various cave towns that are scattered throughout the area. Sitting atop one side of a double mesa separated by a 500-foot-wide valley, Eski-Kermen began life as a Byzantine boundary fortress in the 6th century, manned by the Goths. They built extensive fortifications, including a town gate carved right into the bedrock, a siege wall, tunnels, hidden staircases, grain storage pits, and an underground gallery where water was gathered from a natural spring. During this time, Eski-Kermen held a dominant position in the economic life of nearby settlements, serving as a trade hub. At its peak, more than 350 caves were used for habitation, livestock housing, craft workshops, and other storage. Some of them had wooden or tiled flooring or balconies and wooden piping for water. Eski-Kermen was then held by the Khazars from the 8th century up to the 13th century. For reasons unknown, they demolished much of the defensive infrastructure from the 10th century onward. After the Mongols ravaged Crimea in the 14th century, the cave town system collapsed and they were rarely inhabited again. The great thing about visiting here now is you can see it all and walk right through the whole complex. It takes a bit of effort as the paths ascend steeply from the valley floor, but with some sweat and strain, you are soon rewarded with sweeping views of the surrounding mesas, valleys, and canyons. Watch your step and take your time to explore the fascinating archaeological oddity of Eski-Kermen.  Eski-Kermen is located about 9 miles (14km) south of Bakhchisaray in Crimea. Other cave towns in the area include Chufut-Kale, Tepe-Kermen, and Kyz-Kule.",medieval caves ecosystems history
2,Glade of Fairy Tales,"Yalta, Crimea","Over 300 wood sculptures depicting characters from Slavic, Greek and Western folk tales fill this magical garden.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glade-of-fairy-tales,"Located in the Ukrainian resort city of Yalta, the Glade of Fairy Tales is an open air museum full of hand-carved totems inspired by traditional folktales and stories, well living up to its whimsical name. Founded in 1960 by woodcarver and artist Pavel Bezrukov, the Glade of Fairy Tales has grown in popularity to become one of Yalta’s premier attractions. After having been kicked off by Bezrukov, the project continued to grow and now contains works by dozens of different artists. The styles range widely from the brutally totemic depiction of knights to 3D renderings of Disney’s Seven Dwarves. The only connecting element is that they all represent fairy tales or folk tales, most of which are uniquely culturally specific. Other figures in the park include Baba Yaga and her chicken-legged house, the mythical Russian folk hero Svyatogor, Teremok the magical house-in-the-woods, and dozens of other pagan gods and legendary creatures. Throughout the popular park there are over 300 different carvings. Some are brightly painted, while others have been left unvarnished, but all of them seem pretty magical. To Western eyes, many Russian folk tales are seem a bit dark or strange, and even in the Glade, they can still seem a bit foreboding. But placing them in an actual enchanted garden helps to bring out some of the magic.",fairytales gardens plants statues
3,Underwater Museum at Cape Tarkhankut,"Olenivka, Crimea",Submerged busts of communist and socialist figures from the USSR.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/underwater-museum-at-cape-tarkhankut,"Organized more than 15 years ago, this museum boasts a collection of busts of communist leaders and the heads of socialism throughout the history of the USSR — lined up on stone shelves and racks and buried underwater. It’s without an official website of its own and without a lot of documentation, but the underwater museum at Cape Tarkhankut is considered a must-see attraction in Crimea. The organizers of the underwater museum are always open to adding new figures to the collection, which currently has more than 50 different busts. The busts are known as the Alley of Leaders. Known as a romantic and mysterious place, Cape Tarkhankut is at the western end of the Crimean peninsula. Here, a hot and humid steppe fades into the Black Sea and fresh springs erupt from the bottom of the salty waters. It is at this point that the summers are hot and dry, the days warm and windy, and the nights cool an quiet. It is at this point that the sea is crystal clear, drawing in tourists from all over the world. With the sea as clean and clear as it is here, underwater visibility can often exceed 30 feet, making the Alley of Leaders visible even from above the surface of the water.",communist architecture underwater week underwater natural wonders water sculptures nature museums and collections museums
4,Koyashskoe Salt Lake,"Kerch, Crimea",The saltiest lake in all of Crimea is also the pinkest of the pink and teeming with life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koyashskoe-salt-lake,"Lake Koyashskoe is an anomaly in the sense that the drier it gets, the more beautiful it becomes. This is because as the water evaporates and the salt content rises, the microscopic algae and brine shrimp that gives this lake its ever-darkening pink hue flourishes and concentrates. The water level drops, and salt crystals sparkling like diamonds encrust rocks that jut out from the water. Measuring at about 350 grams of salt per liter, Lake Koyashskoe is the most saline body of water in Crimea (a territory which is now occupied by Russia, but is still claimed by Ukraine). Located in the Opukske Nature Reserve, the lake creates a martian landscape on the Kerch Peninsula, and is separated from the Black sea by only a small strip of land. Against the sea’s cerulean waters and white shores, the crustacean pink really pops in contrast. Not nearly as treacherous as the torrid Lake Natron or as deep as the salt-rich Lake Retba, Lake Koyashskoe is small for a majestically pink salt lake. Regularly only about three feet deep, the water stretches across a silt bed about four and a half miles long and a little over a mile wide. The silt below the lake is said to have some serious medicinal properties, and the locals have long collected it as well as farmed salt from the water’s edge. Like its salty associates, it’s uninhabitable for most plants and creatures, with an exception for brine shrimp and the algae that give the water its pink to scarlet glow.",pink wonders of salt salt martian landscapes lakes natural wonders ecosystems water nature
5,Decommissioned Soviet Sub Base,"Sevastopol, Crimea",In the land of the Light Brigade stands a testament to the Cold War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/decommissioned-soviet-sub-base,"Balaclava has occupied a place in military history for centuries. During the Crimean War the Battle of Balaclava, which was fought between British and Russian troops, was immortalized by Tennyson in his poem, The Charge of the Light Brigade. More recently however visitors to the town have been able to experience and tour an old Soviet Submarine base that was constructed during the Cold War. This concrete and steel complex, once a testament to the power of the Soviet Union, now stands derelict having been virtually abandoned since 1993. Designed to withstand the direct impact of a nuclear weapon, the base is covered in a 56meter thick layer of concrete, and includes a warren of tunnels and corridors that at one time housed some of the most advanced and destructive weapons of the Cold War. During this period the entire town was enveloped in a dense cloud of military security with few outsiders permitted to enter the base or the town. Balaclava was cut off from the rest of the world, most of the inhabitants worked on the base and, because of the highly classified nature of their work, were not allowed out of the town. In fact the base could support the entire population of Balaclava (3000 people or so) autonomously for three years in the case of nuclear fall out. Since the base’s decommissioning in the early nineties visitors have been able to tour through the complex and also visit a small museum which sits in a former ammunition depot buried deep within the hillside. Located on the Black Sea Coast, only six miles or so outside of the city of Sevastopol, the base is not only an interesting tourist attraction but also serves as a reminder of the secrecy and militarism that surrounded the Cold War.",cold war soviet history ghost towns military history military
6,Ai-Petri Bridges,"Yalta, Crimea",One of the windiest peaks in Crimea is home to an incredible set of cable bridges.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aipetri-bridges,"While Crimea is a bit too contentious for casual tourism, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t wonders to be found among the turmoil. For instance the peak of Ai-Petri where high winds buffet a handful of rickety suspension bridges for a good portion of the year. Ai-Petri, meaning St. Peter in Greek, is a peak in the Crimean Mountains. One of the windiest places in Crimea, the wind blows for 125 days in a year and up to speeds of 100 miles per hour. In addition to the somewhat troublesome winds, the high peak is also one of the foggiest places in the Ukraine, giving the heights an air of mystery and danger. But for all the foggy and blustery conditions on the 4,000 foot elevation, it offers amazing views the surrounding cities of Yalta and Alupka, as well as the Black Sea. But the view of the peak itself is an incredible sight to see. The most well known feature is a tall cross that has been planted in the actual peak, which is a lone stone pillar. Sightseers can reach the via a pair of wood-slate cable bridges that stretch out over the often cloudy void. It certainly does not look to be for the faint of heart. The cable bridges were built in recent years, and allows for safe passage to the cross that was long-ago erected on a rock formation. The top can be reached by a long hike to the top, but most visitors opt for the cable car ride that will take you right there and back for about $4 each way. It offers the added benefit of allowing you to be suspended over a yawning void for even longer.",mountains bridges
7,Druzhba,"Yalta, Crimea",This space age health spa looks like a supervillain's lair.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/druzhba,"This space age building overlooking the Black Sea would be the perfect hideout for a villain on vacation. Indeed, when Druzhba was built in 1986, designed by famous Soviet architect Igor Vasilevsky, the structure overlooking the sea was so ominous Turkish spies assumed it was a secret military building. They couldn’t have been more wrong. The building, whose name means “friendship,” is actually a health spa. The strange spaceship design allows for private balconies and amazing views from most of the rooms. On the outside it appears harsh and blocky, but on the inside the circular spa is open, light, and airy. The centre of the building contains social amenities like a salt water pool, a cinema, and cafes. The artistic concept draws heavily from science fiction depictions of futuristic cities, as well as the Soviet architectural tendencies to maximize public space in a space age style. Vasilevsky credited flying saucers and time machines as inspiration for his design. Today the spa remains open and popular as ever, catering mostly to tourists.",soviet architecture resorts health hotels architectural oddities architecture
8,Tsarsky Kurgan,"Kerch, Crimea",This ancient burial mound is accessed by an impressive Greek-built archway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tsarsky-kurgan,"The Tsarsky Kurgan or Royal Kurgan is believed to have been constructed as long ago as the 4th century BCE, but the lovely vaulted hallway leading to the burial chamber inside looks like it was made much more recently. A “kurgan” is a type of burial mound where the bulbous pile of dirt and stones is piled atop a burial chamber of some kind. The Tsarsky Kurgan of Crimea is unique among these structures for its entrance hall which is a sharply vaulted limestone corridor that looks almost as though it was created in a much more modern epoch. It was the Greeks who inhabited the area at the time who used their noted building abilities to create the artful entrance. There are a number of kurgans found in what is the modern Ukrainian city of Kerch. Since the Tsarsky Kurgan is said to hold the remains of an ancient king, it stands out above all the rest. The modern researchers of the site found the burial vault empty, likely looted long before they arrived, but it is believed that a king of the ancient Bosporan state was once interred there. Later Christian scrawlings have also been found in the empty burial rooms, suggesting that the mound was used as a hiding place for the early adherents to the religion. Today the hallway of the ancient mound can still be entered through the angular hall. Just look for the mound with the giant cleft in the side.",mounds archaeology architectural oddities architecture
9,The 'Valley of Death',"Sevastopol, Crimea",This vineyard was the site of the infamous Charge of the Light Brigade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-valley-of-death-sevastopol-crimea,"There’s a reason this plot of land is referred to as the “Valley of Death.” Though it now looks like no more than a tranquil vineyard, this spot was once the stage for a tragic battle caused by a terrible military blunder. The Charge of the Light Brigade is one of the most storied military actions in British military history. The cavalry’s ill-fated charge was so disastrous, the Russian forces they battled allegedly believed the British soldiers had been drunk. The Light Brigade was supposed to have been sent to prevent Russians from capturing guns from overrun Turkish positions during the Crimean War. But as a result of miscommunications in the chain of command, the troops were instead ordered into a full frontal assault against a well-defended artillery battery, where they faced direct fire from all sides. Surprisingly, the Brigade was not annihilated, though casualties were predictably high. The men fought with just lances and sabres. Their mounts lacked armor. Of the approximately 670 who rode, 278 were killed or injured and 335 horses perished. While the reputation of the British cavalry’s bravery may have been enhanced, the same cannot be said for the commanding officers whose subsequent attempts to blame each other for the disaster descended into farce. The charge itself achieved little, but the fact that there were no recorded objections to a potentially suicidal action has sealed the Light Brigade’s reputation in history. Witnessing the charge in its full glory prompted a French Marshal by the name of Pierre Bosquet to utter the damning statement, “C’est magnifique, mais ce n’est pas la guerre. C’est de la folie” (“It is magnificent but it is not war, it is madness”). The tragedy of the event was immortalized in the 1854 poem, “The Charge of the Light Brigade.”  Visiting the site is not so easy since Russia annexed the Crimea, but it's well worth making the effort if possible. There are plenty of knowledgeable guides in Yalta who can arrange a visit to all the sites connected with the Crimean War (including Sevastopol). The area has many memorials and an excellent museum relating to the Crimean War. From the surrounding hills you can get a good view of the valley which has changed little since 1854. It's possible to visit the valley itself, but it is now a vineyard so care should be taken to keep to the track.",military history war history military
10,Vorontsov Palace,"Alupka, Crimea",This magnificent Crimean estate was once a playground of the Russian elite.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vorontsov-palace,"Built between 1828 and 1848, this magical palace near the town of Alupka has enchanted visitors for almost 200 years. During the early 1800s, the newly-annexed Crimean seaside was the place to summer if you were rich, Russian, and royal. Prince Mikhail Vorontsov (1782-1856), viceroy of New Russia, wanted in on the action and began construction on this impressive summer estate, which cost around nine million silver rubles. A true Anglophile, Vorontsov wanted his palace to remind him of the English architecture he’d grown to love so much during his education in London.  The palace was in part based on designs drawn in the English Renaissance Revival style by the architect Edward Blore, who worked on Buckingham Palace. It was also greatly influenced by the local Tartar architecture of the Crimea. In the end, the completed project was a strange mish-mash of styles and influence- of East meets West. Spectacular gardens surrounded the palace. Sadly, the palace’s reputation is forever blighted by the fact that it was built by serfs who had been imported from Russia. After the prince’s death, the palace changed hands numerous times, and was turned into a museum after the Russian Revolution. During WW2, the Nazis invaded Crimea and gained control of the palace. They had intended to blow it up, but luckily, the Crimean army’s advances forced them to retreat before they were able to carry out their nefarious plot, and the palace was saved. During negotiations at the Yalta Convention, held in the nearby Livadia Palace, Winston Churchill stayed in Vorontsov Palace. He was so impressed by the lion statues that stood proudly at the entrance that he asked Stalin if he could take one home. The request was denied. But Churchill’s memory of the palace lives on: “The setting of our abode was impressive … Behind the villa, half Gothic and half Moorish in style, rose the mountains, covered in snow, culminating in the highest peak in the Crimea. Before us lay the dark expanse of the Black Sea, severe, but still agreeable and warm even at this time of the year. Carved white lions guarded the entrance to the house, and beyond the courtyard lay a fine park with sub-tropical plants and cypresses.” Today, the palace is a spectacular museum and garden.  Open to the public, it is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Crimea.",palaces slavery royalty war history military
11,Scythian Neapolis Ruins,"Simferopol, Crimea",The ancient ruins of an extinguished city amidst the bustle of a modern one.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/scythian-neapolis-ruins,"Driven south by the Sarmatian tribes, the Scythians hung their hats on the banks of the Salhyr River near the end of the 3rd century BCE, hoping to enjoy their new empire for centuries to come. They called it Neapolis, and it enjoyed six more centuries before it perished. In a short time the city evolved into an influential trade hub, successful farming and crafts center with a strong Greek influence when it came to culture and architecture. While the settlement was certainly sophisticated in many ways, the Scythians were considered barbarians, assumedly due to their affection for decapitating their enemies and drinking their blood. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times… Despite their connection to Greek culture, there was no love lost between the Scythians and the neighboring Greek settlement of Chersonese, who they constantly battled with. Due to this ongoing spat, the embattled city was surrounded by sturdy defensive walls, though unfortunately they were not sturdy enough, and after a successful attack by the Greeks, Neapolis burned. A tenacious people, the Scythians dug deep into their warrior roots and rebuilt, the stone walls of Neapolis grew higher and stronger. The revival of the city was successful, and the civilization remained viable until somewhere around 3rd century CE. At the end of their reign, they suffered the same ill fate of so many others–being in the path of the military maelstrom that was the Goths and later the Huns, whose aggressive migration steamrolled them out of existence for good. Where Scythian Neapolis once stood, the busy city of Simferopol (home to the longest trolleybus route in the world) currently thrives as the hub of modern day Crimea. Echoes of the ancient people that once were, can be found in the outskirts of town, its sturdy defense walls one of the few remains left standing, but it’s what lies under the dead city that is truly wondrous. During excavation, a sprawling mausoleum was uncovered. In more than 70 dig spots, the mausoleum appeared, and soon its most prominent occupants were unearthed–the final rulers of Neopolis, King Scylurus, accompanied by his queen.",ancient archaeology ruins
12,Cross Rock,"Cape Fiolent, Crimea",A massive cross stands as the sole resident of this water-locked Crimean crag.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cross-rock,"Staring out to sea from the coast of Cape Fiolent on the Crimean peninsula, the most stunning thing that stands out across the picturesque seascape is a single giant cross, jutting up from a small rock island. Known as Cross Rock or alternately the Rock of the Saint Image, this otherwise unremarkable oceanic feature is a lonely and stunning tribute to local faith. As the story of the rock goes, a ship carrying hundreds of Greek sailors was caught in a storm in 890 that threatened to kill them all, so they began to pray to St. George for help. The kindly saint went ahead and appeared on the rock and told the storm to chill out, which it did. As thanks for pulling them out of harm’s way, the sailors created a monastery on the shore near where they were saved. Over time the monastery fell into disrepair, but the story was not lost. On the 1,000 year anniversary of the sailors’ miraculous rescue and the founding of their church, a restoration effort began that brought the monastery back to life. In addition to returning the monastery to good working condition, a cross was installed on the rock where the saint is said to have appeared. Standing over 20 feet tall and weighing over a ton and a half, the rock cross is hard to miss, and the story is hard to forget. While it is not the largest monumental cross in the world, and the story that inspired it may seem a bit hard to swallow, even by early Christian allegorical standards, Cross Rock makes an unforgettably beautiful sight.",crosses rocks monuments geology
13,Crimean Trolleybus Line,"Simferopol, Crimea","The longest trolleybus route in the world, from Simferopol and Yalta.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crimean-trolleybus-line,"Despite its political troubles, Crimea has always had a place of relaxation and beauty–the Crimean Peninsula along the Black Sea. The seaside resort of Yalta has been a desirable vacation destination on the peninsula for decades. Once only accessible to the Russian aristocracy, and literary celebrities such as Tolstoy and Chekhov, in 1920 Lenin decided that the tired proletarians deserved a little R&R too, and made a decree “On the Use of Crimea for the Medical Treatment of the Working People”. The working people happened to work (for the most part) in the city of Simferopol, which happened to be a good 50-plus miles away from Yalta. Looking over the different transportation options, it was decided that the rock in the area was too soft to support a railway, and buses would be unpleasant and produce too much pollution. So they decided to build an electric trolley route. A 54-mile long trolley route, the longest in the world. Built in 1959, the trolleybus line efficiently weaves through the Crimean mountains, rolling through beautiful vineyards and romantic villas. Ocean views and lovely, varied landscapes fill the two to three hour ride, but if scenery isn’t your thing, the trolleys are also equipped with Russian TV. The trolleybus is said to have transported six billion people since its construction. Some may say that the Czechoslovakia-built trolley is a little rough on the eyes, but many feel it matches the decaying yet colorful resorts that litter the peninsula that was once the private playground of Tzars and luminaries, and now belongs to the people.",world's longest transportation
14,Blue Cave of Bisevo,"Komiža, Croatia",An ethereal glowing blue ocean cave in Croatia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-cave-of-bisevo,"The blue cave of Bisevo is not terribly easy to visit. First, you must get yourself to the Croatian island of Vis, by ferry from the city of Split. Once there, travel by bus or motorbike to the other side of the island, to the tiny fishing town of Komiza. There, hire a boat or tour to take you to the island of Bisevo, about an hour boat ride from Komiza. Then you will approach the cave via a small rubber raft, which is just small enough to enter the tiny cave entrance. The Blue Cave (Modra špilja) is located at the Balun Cove on the eastern side of the island. Though Croatian fisherman have known of the blue cave since ancient times, it wasn’t until 1884 that a (relatively) easy entrance was blasted out with dynamite. Before this small hole in the side of the rock was opened, the only entrance into the cave was to dive underneath the rock wall in just the right spot. The cave is at its most beautiful between 11 am and 12 pm on a sunny day. The bright blue glowing effect is created when the sun’s rays enter through the water and reflect off the limestone floor of the cave. The bright sun lights up the water, and the glowing ocean illuminates the cave walls a brilliant blue, creating an ethereal glowing blue grotto. Though not an easy trek, it is a rewarding one – the blue cave is a truly enchanting natural wonder.",caves ecosystems water
15,Plitvice Lakes,"Plitvička Jezera, Croatia",A chain of 16 wondrous lakes formed as a result of the gradual dissolution of soluble layers of bedrock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plitvi-ka-jezera-plitvice-lakes,"Karst is not a particular kind of rock, but rather the landscape that results from the combination of certain types of rock, often limestone or dolomite, and water. The important element is that these types of rock are all soluable in water. Put this type of rock in combination with water and over the years the water works its way through the rock and leads to all sorts of natural wonders. This type of geographical landscape is known as “karst topography” and is the basis of some of the most visually amazing geographical locations in the world. Most of stone foundation of the Balkan peninsula is made of thick deposit of limestone accumulated over eons. Together with the areas abundance of springs, rivers and lush vegetation it has created some spectacular and Eden-like environments. Plitvice lakes in Croatia is a series of 16 mountain lakes formed thanks to one such phenomenon. Travertine is a special kind of limestone which accumulates from calcium carbonate rich surface waters on the surface of living moss, forming growing barriers, and creating a chain of lakes and waterfalls. In an epic race, on a timescale of many thousands of years, the water wears away at the underlying limestone at the same time as the travertine barriers grow at pace of up to 1cm per year, creating an ever morphing, growing, reducing landscape. The whole region of Plitvice is a national park, and the plitvice lakes are one of the main attractions of the inland part of Croatia, situated in Lika region of Croatia, in the midst of the Dinaric Alps. The lakes are divided into the 12 Upper Lakes (Gornja jezera) and the four Lower Lakes (Donja jezera). While the national park is quite safe, don’t wander too far from the paths. The UNESCO recognized park was the site of the first skirmish between Serbia and Croatia during the Balkan wars and landmines were planted throughout. Though it was certified mine-free in 1998, (Croatia has worked extremely hard to demine the country) it is believed there may still be a few errant landmines in some of the more remote areas of the park.

The organ’s music is eerily reminiscent of the melancholy sound of whale calls. The Sea Organ was designed by architect Nikola Bašić and completed in 2005.

Unable to let go, some of us hide the barrettes he gave us before he left town to “find himself” in an ornate box under the bed, while others burn photos taken of her before she was caught texting a “friend.” The most mundane items in the world suddenly represent everything that might have been. When Croatian artists Olinka Vistina and Drazen Grubisic separated, their reluctance to part with the sentimental reminders of their fizzled love inspired them to open the Museum of Broken Relationships, so that the items could remain together. At first glance, this concept may seem to contradict healthy healing, but the idea took off, and while the museum was on tour, people from all over began to donate their reminders of heartbreak. Now the museum has a permanent home in Croatia and contains a fascinating collection of former tokens of affection. Besides the anticipated teddy bears and letters, the collection also includes a few poignant and sometimes unsettling surprises – a tiny bottle filled with a woman’s tears, an axe, and taser gun, and perhaps the strangest offering, a prosthetic leg. As melancholy as the subject may seem, the museum is quite popular—be it voyeurism, purification, or just the acknowledgment that the lonely feeling of heart sickness is universal, over 1,000 people per week visit the collection. Due to this location’s intense success, a second Museum of Broken Relationships opened in Los Angeles in 2016.

What about if they went to school, played tennis, or ran a circus? You can find out at the strange, delightful Froggyland museum in Croatia. The collection of anthropomorphic amphibians at Froggyland consists of 507 stuffed frogs arranged in 21 cases. These dioramas were the life’s work of 20th century Hungarian taxidermist Ference Mere, who devoted 10 years to stuffing and meticulously arranging the frogs. When he completed the project in 1920, there were around 1,000 of them. The frogs displayed at Froggyland passed from owner to owner until finally making it to Croatia and getting their own museum. Mere’s project may sound eccentric, but his work is truly remarkable. He used an advanced taxidermy technique in which the frogs were stuffed with cork through the mouth. This time-consuming process left the frogs entirely whole, lacking any external incisions. The varied dioramas - a blacksmith shop, a music lesson, a day on the lake - present everyday life scenarios down to the smallest detail. A photographer holds a tiny camera. A painter has been given a little easel and paintbrush. In the classroom scene, one frog raises two fingers to indicate that it is about to speak.

19,Zeljava Airbase,"Željava, Croatia",Yugoslavia's biggest underground airport lies in ruins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zeljava-airbase,"In the movie Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, the rebels keep their spacecraft hidden in an underground base, to come out only when striking at the Empire. Željava Air Base was Communist Yugoslavia’s version of that base. Situated in the east of Croatia on the border with Bosnia, Objekat 505, as it was officially known, was the largest underground airport in the Balkans. The primary purpose of the Objekat 505 was to house a long-range radar early warning system, akin to NORAD, as well as to provide a strategic command center for the country’s defense. The construction of the base was conducted in utmost secrecy between 1957 and 1965, and the cost of its construction was a whopping six billion dollars, three times more than the combined yearly military budgets of Yugoslavia’s two biggest successor states, Serbia and Croatia. The secret airbase was positioned at the center of a dense sprawling network of military installations, with five auxiliary airfields nearby as well as numerous radar and air defense outposts. The resulting base was a military marvel, an underground airport with four exits, each of which was capable of launching jets.  The base housed two full hunter squadrons. The base was designed to sustain a direct hit by a 20-kiloton nuclear warhead, the equivalent of the Nagasaki bomb, and it could be hermetically sealed. The base could also house up to 1,000 people and stored provisions for up to 30 days. Objekat 505 also had access to an underground water supply and a power generator. Fuel for the generator was brought into the base by deep pipes coming from an underground storage facility near the town of Bihać. The base was intended to protect the country from the foreign aggression. Unfortunately, its designers had not taken into account the possibility of a civil war. On October 25, 1991, on the eve of the war, Rudolf Perešin, one of the fighter pilots stationed in the base, an ethnic Croat who did not want to fight, defected and escaped the base via the fourth exit. He was also not the only one; not too long afterwards, Daniel Borović also defected with his jet, though he managed to land at Zagreb Airport (Perešin had to divert to Klagenfurt in Austria, his jet now on display at Zeltweg Airbase). Even though they did not depart from the base itself, two other pilots - Ivan Selak and Ivica Ivandić - were also based there, but transferred to Užice in Serbia following Željava’s destruction. During its retreat from this region of Croatia, the Yugoslav National Army decided to destroy the functionality of the airbase to avoid its use by any of the factions in the conflict. They did so by setting off built-in explosive charges. A year later, the demolition of the base was completed by the military of the then Republic of Serbian Krajina, and an additional 56 tons of explosive were detonated. The explosion was so powerful that it was felt in all the way in Bihać. Today the abandoned airbase lies on the border of Croatia and the Bosnian Federation, with the line dividing the countries running through the middle of the property. Extreme caution needs to be used when approaching this site, due to the large number of unexploded landmines and other munitions there. The police force of the Bosnian Federation uses the area of the airbase to train its K9 core in explosive retrieval.  Unfortunately, since the migrant crisis, it's difficult to reach this place. In fact, this Airbase is exactly on the border between Croatia and Bosnia, many cops patrols turn around. If they catch somebody, they will have to pay a fine. But it can be possible to send a letter or a mail to the Croatian police saying you are a tourist who wants to visit this place. And normally, you will get the authorization. There is a reasonable amount of pollution with PCB mostly inside the tunnels but also in the soil outside. Additionally, there have been numerous smoke detectors inside the tunnels which were based on Americium-241. It is unknown what happened to them during the destruction. As such, a visit can be a health risk.",airplanes subterranean sites abandoned ruins

A nearby plaque reads “Here are buried 900 soldiers from the wider area of Moslavine who sacrificed their lives for the freedom and independence of our nation during the National Liberation Struggle from 1941 to 1945.” The monument crowns a hill in the small town of Podgarić, where it towers over an artificial lake below. The structure was commissioned by Tito, Yugoslavia’s long-time dictator, who ordered the creation of a number of similar monuments to World War II sites throughout Yugoslavia. Most of the sites were former Yugoslav Partisan memorials, the party with which Tito was involved and who took over after the war. The abstract monuments were meant to symbolize power and triumph, but were poorly maintained after Yugoslavia fragmented.

Connected to land by only a narrow walkway that just barely rises above the water, its arrow-like shape suggests that this fortress was not one to be messed with. The structure’s seemingly impenetrable exterior hides large, looming brick hallways that beg to be explored. The Venetians built St. Nicholas Fortress in the 16th century to block maritime Turkish attacks and keep any invaders from coming ashore. Constructed from a sturdy blend of brick and stone, its triangular shape and 32 resident cannons made it a truly formidable form of defense. In fact, it looked so foreboding and impenetrable that no one even tried to test it. Its appearance and reputation alone were enough to deter any would-be attackers from tempting their fate. Yet despite its lack of action, the military continued to maintain the fortress for centuries until they eventually abandoned it in 1979. Now, only urban explorers infiltrate the stalwart structure. Most make their way inside via the land, though those with access to a boat can try their hand at squeezing in through the sea-facing entrance. The fortress’s surprisingly airy interior is remarkably well-preserved, making it easy to imagine you, too, are a member of one of the various armies that occupied its walls during its many centuries of use.  The only way to make it to the fortress is via the official boat tour from Sibenik Riva. The fortress is not yet accessible by a footpath from Sv. Nikola beach because the land entrance is under construction. The only entrance is the one from the sea.",fortresses military history islands abandoned military
22,Abandoned Haludovo Palace Hotel,"Malinska, Croatia",This truly palatial work of Communist-era architecture now sits crumbling on a Croatian beach.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-haludovo-palace-hotel,"Perched on a beach on the Croatian island of Krk is the Haludovo Palace Hotel, which today resembles a crumbling 1970s sci-fi movie set more than a palace. When it opened, the hotel complex was a high-end destination by eastern European standards, considered the most luxurious vacation spot in what was then Yugoslavia. Built in 1971 under the supervision of architect Boris Magaš, the structure exemplifies midcentury space age design, with a certain monolithic quality typical of Communist-influenced architecture. Its modular shapes, asymmetric concrete beams and columns, and wood paneled interior place the hotel firmly in a bygone era. A year after the hotel opened, Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione invested $45 million, expanding it to include the Penthouse Adriatic Club Casino. Through glitzy tourist attractions, he reasoned, better relations could develop between the United States and Yugoslavia. The offerings of the hotel and casino, including high-end cuisine, a cocktail bar, pool, saunas, a tennis court, and constantly scheduled entertainment were a far cry from many Western visions of Communist eastern Europe. While Yugoslavia under the “benevolent dictator” Josip Broz Tito may have been a highly restricted and regulated society, foreign tourists were given a pass and allowed to gamble at the casino. Athletes, actors, dignitaries and leaders from all over the world spent time at the Haludovo Palace. However, this golden age didn’t last forever. When war broke out in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the region became less attractive to foreign tourists hoping to blow money and soak up the sun. By the time Croatia gained its independence, the hotel had been abandoned for years, and was in a state of decay. It remains that way today, a time capsule representing one of the strangest eras (and locales) in the history of tourism. The hotel can be a dangerous place. There's glass all over the floors, the handrails are missing, the stairs are in bad condition.

The luxury hotel only operated for six years in late 20th century. Ever since, it’s been left to crumble into the sea. When the hotel opened in 1985 it had over 200 rooms, a helipad, and its own private boat dock. The complex has remained abandoned since the Croatian War of Independence. It has, however, had brief stints of occupation. During a siege on the city in 1991, dozens of Croatian refugees took shelter within its derelict walls. The 18 floors of the hotel are filled with shattered glass and the remnants of fallen walls. The outside offers several terraces at varying levels that descend the cliff, each with an unparalleled view over the bay toward Dubrovnik Old Town and Lokrum Island. Its decorated sea-level amphitheater was used as a set for Game of Thrones. It was briefly adorned with the crest of House Baratheon for shooting, but some locals replaced that with a more geographically appropriate symbol: the crest of Hajduk, a local football club from Split, a city about 140 miles down the coast. In 2014, the property was sold at public auction. Russian Billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, known for his impressive private collection of Fabergé eggs, bought the complex for 12 million euros (about $14 million dollars).

Since the origin of the medieval structure remains unknown, it has become the stuff of legend over the years. According to the legend of Ružica Grad, this castle used to be the meeting place of fairies, where magic potions were made. Fairies met in peace here until one day, a nobleman decided to build a fortified city right on this spot. The fairies, horrified at this threat to their gathering place, used their magic to ruin the nobleman’s construction plans. Whatever the workers would build during the day, the fairies would destroy overnight. Angered by this, the nobleman decided to erect a net around the construction site. The hair of the most beautiful fairy, Ružica, became entangled in the net, and she was caught. As a warning to all the fairies, the nobleman built Ružica into the foundations of his city. However, the fairy curse did not end there. Just as the trumpets announced the completion of the construction, a stone slid down and killed the nobleman, ending his lineage. Ružica’s name, on the other hand, still lives in the name of the old fortress. And so Ružica Grad still stands on a steep rock, surrounded by the fresh Papuk forest. It is the crown of Papuk mountain, and a witness of untold times.  Take a hike (not long, but intense), from Orahovica lake trough the wood.

The head stands some half a meter above the ground, sticking out barely 15 centimeters. Its top surface is polished like marble. The wall above it is noticeably greasy from the touch of a thousand hands. Legend has it that if you manage to hop onto the head, keep your balance, and take off your shirt while still standing facing the wall, luck in love will follow you.

From sanatorium to military hospital to paintball arena, the Brestovac Sanatorium has lived a number of lives. First built in 1909, at the time of its creation, the hospital was one of the finest tuberculosis care facilities in all of Europe. Nestled in the calming mountain woods, it gave its patients a beautiful spot in which to relax and recuperate. But it was not just the scenery that led to the creation of the sanatorium. As the story goes it was actually love that led to the founding of the Brestovac facility. As the tale goes, Croatian doctor Milivoj Dezman fell in love with a beautiful theater actress known as Lady Sram. Dezman lived for his lady love, so when she came down with tuberculosis, he convinced the city founders to build a hospital to treat the disease, making sure that it was one of the best to accommodate his lover, who was one of the first patients. Sadly Lady Sram is said to have died in 1913, leaving Dezman to operate the hospital for years after. The sanitarium was used as a military hospital in both of the World Wars, but 1968, the facility had fallen into disrepair, and eventually it was simply abandoned, leaving the main building and a number of other structures to slowly decay into haunting ruins. Today the site is open for any explorers who want to check out the mouldering hospital remains, but they seem to be used pretty frequently by paintballers who are indiscriminate in their targets, so watch your back.",abandoned hospitals hospitals abandoned ruins

However, to enterprising Croat locals all of that is old news and Petrova Gora is simply a convenient source of shiny new building materials. Built in 1981 by Vojin Bakić, the Petrova Gora monument stands 12 stories tall, atop a mountain of the same name. “Petrova  Gora” or “Peter’s Mountain” is also home to a system of underground chambers and tunnels which served as both a secret field hospital during WWII and a printing press for the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The former Yugoslavian countries are full of futuristic brutalist monuments and most of which are under the protection of the Croatian state. However, the Petrova Gora monument has a problem. The site apparently lacks the proper legal documentation and papers, and with no one to protect it the monument has become an easy target for locals looking for free building materials. It has been slowly losing its exterior metal, panel by panel, for years. However, despite the destruction, the monument doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Underneath all that valuable metal is a huge poured concrete skeleton twisting up the 12 stories like a stretched Guggenheim. It would take quite a bit of effort to destroy the concrete interior, likely more effort than the local government cares to expend, so the monument remains in a permanent state of disassembly. As Croatia has changed, so has the meaning of their monument. This particular monument is no longer seen as a proud reminder of Croatia’s past. Instead the monument’s current rough appearance mirrors a Croatia primarily interested in building its future, even if it means dismantling its past. However more recently, the monument has found one practical new use. It is used as a broadcasting tower for Croatian Television and T-Mobile service.

Tesla’s family homestead is simple, even by 19th-century standards. Still, the compound, complete with only a whitewashed house, barn and the Serbian Orthodox Church of which Tesla’s father was minister, stands as a monument to the austerity that produced one of Croatia’s most influential native sons. And Croatia wants the world to remember. On July 10, 2006, on the 150th anniversary of Tesla’s birth and coinciding with Croatia’s state-mandated “Year of Nikola Tesla,” Tesla’s birthplace was opened as a museum. The museum is composed of the two halves of Tesla’s self: his idyllic country upbringing and his science-oriented adult life. Comprised of a multimedia center with hands-on science exhibits, renovated original structures, a playground for future scientists, and – perhaps most fitting – Tesla’s favorite childhood brook outfitted with an experimental display, the museum has become a rather surprising tourist attraction. One of the most noteworthy exhibitions at the multimedia center is a demonstration of rotating magnetic field principles, illustrated with a jumping-and-jittering iron egg. The idea is that two or more magnetic currents interacting with each other alternately take control of the egg and make it spin in seemingly random directions and speeds. From the main highway – Zagreb-Split – near Smiljan, take the Gospic exit.

Augustinian monks first began building atop a rock in the middle of the lake in the 14th century. But in 1445, Franciscan monks took over after leaving Bosnia. They expanded the little monastery the Augustinians had started and built the Franciscan Monastery of Our Lady of Mercy and the Church of Our Lady of Visovac. For centuries, the small island was a place of solitude, a destination for young men to prepare themselves for a life of priesthood. Today, the monastery houses three monks and five novices from the Franciscan order. The monastery also has a small but extremely impressive museum. It’s packed with historic church clothes, manuscripts, and rare books including a medieval copy of Aesop’s fables printed by Lastovo printer Dobrić Dobričević. The museum even contains a saber that belonged to Vuk Mandušić, a 17th-century rebel leader and hero within Croatian epic poetry. Although within a popular National Park, the monastery is off the beaten tourist tracks and placed halfway between two large waterfalls.

The grocery is located within the 2,500-square-foot ground floor of the historic Mala Papalićeva Palača complex, the former home of a noble family. The treasured medieval site possesses UNESCO status, believed to have been built in the 13th century and reconstructed 200 years later by the esteemed Venetian-Dalmatian architect Juraj Dalmatinac (also referred to as Giorgio da Sebenico). The Papalićeva building is itself within the borders of Diocletian’s Palace, a city within a city that comprises the historic center of Split. Split’s origins date back to the ancient Roman Empire, as exemplified by the ruins of the palace itself, a magnificent and superbly preserved 4th-century fortress built by the emperor Diocletian. Split’s historic center was granted UNESCO World Heritage status in 1979. But the ground floor of the Mala Papalićeva Palača is privately owned, which gave the food retailer the legal right to purchase the space for a new grocery store in 2014. While the supermarket wasn’t directly granted protection by UNESCO, it’s technically protected for being situated within a historic monument. Locals weren’t too pleased with the market’s insensitive choice of locale, but the town’s administrative officials had no real grounds to contest the decision. Aside from the absurdity of a UNESCO-protected grocery store, Split officials were concerned about the logistics of a supermarket’s presence in the building; namely, the constant deliveries and the need for new infrastructure after the building had been very carefully conserved with funds provided by the Ministry of Culture. Needless to say, the city’s historic architecture is a proud and indelible part of its alluring heritage. The supermarket, not so much.

Originally built in the 13th century, the large manse was not the product of some lord’s need for a grand home but was instead created as a defensive fortification. Despite its martial background, its position on top of a verdant forest hill has given it a distinctly romantic appeal. Down the centuries the castle has been added to and rebuilt a number of times giving it a bit of a varied design sense, but losing none of its beauty. While the original owner of the castle is unknown, the estate was passed down among a series of Croatian nobles before finally being turned over to the Croatian government in the 1950s. In 1953 Trakošćan Castle was opened to the public as a museum housing a number of historical displays about the area, the castle, and Croatian  history in general. A man-made lake was also built at the foot of the hill making the view from the castle all the more spectacular.

Oh, wait, that’s pretty scary too. The Villa Rebar was first built in 1932, and would become the home of Croatian dictator, Ante Pavelić. During World War II, Pavelić led the Independent State of Croatia, a puppet government that was loyal to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, and was responsible for genocidal actions against Serbians, Jews, and Romani. During his parts of his dark reign, he made the Villa Rebar his home. While living there, Pavelić had a system of tunnels built that connected the manor to military bunkers in the nearby hills, as well as some that acted as escape tunnels. After the war, Pavelić fled, and the villa was eventually remodeled and turned into a mountain resort space, seemingly unafraid of it being the former home of genocidal monster. The final blow to the estate would be a fire in 1979 that all but razed the manor to its stone foundations. after this disaster, the property, along with its tunnels, were simply abandoned. The above ground foundations of the home remain to this day, overgrown and marred with graffiti. Urban explorers have also taken to tagging up the tunnels beneath the estate. However exploring the tunnels beneath the ruins of a genocidal dictator’s former mansion is, obviously, not recommended. Take the #14 tram to the end of the line at Mihaljevac.

They’ve now been abandoned for decades. The once-exclusive holiday resort saw thousands of Yugoslav officers and their families in its heyday. In the early 1990s, during the Croatian War of Independence, the Yugoslav Army destroyed the former beach paradises. After looting each of the five buildings, they systematically burned the hotels down, floor by floor. The hotels—Grand, Kupari, Goričina, Goričine II, and Pelegrin—had enough room for 1,600 guests at a time. A nearby campsite could hold over 4,000 more. They boasted private villas too, and even President Josip Broz Tito had a holiday home at Kupari. The resort wasn’t built exclusively for the military elite, but as its popularity grew, booking became increasingly difficult unless one had connections. Today, the shells of the buildings are overgrown with ivy, weeds, and trees. The beaches that stretch out before the ruins remain popular, the effects of war are still visible to the locals and tourists who frequent the beautiful waters of Croatia. It's a short drive south from Dubrovnik or if you don't have a car, take the public bus heading south on 8 and tell the driver that you’d like to exit at the bus stop in Kupari.

During the 19th century, they desperately fought the Ottoman Empire from the south. Today, they face a less violent mass, and are instead overrun by the great tourist hordes of Northern and Western Europe. In Ston, Croatia, these two forces, historic and economic, meet in the middle. As tourists flock to Croatia for its placid blue-green waters and dramatic seaside cliffs, they still face the great walls that protected the city from Ottomans for the last 500 years. Ston and its smaller neighbor, aptly named Mali Ston (Little Ston), are completely connected and surrounded by a five-kilometer defensive wall. Situated on the Dalmatian coast, the walls and fortified port resemble the more famous Dubrovnik harbor, only 60 kilometers to the south. However, the walls of Ston are twice as long as those of the more-acclaimed Dubrovnik and make up the longest fortress system in Europe. The walls also feature forty stunning defensive towers and a massive hillside fortress looking over the city from the rocky outcroppings above. Although invaders could not destroy the system, the Ston walls took massive damage in an earthquake in 1996. Luckily, this natural disaster spurred a restoration project of the walls. Today visitors come to climb them and look over the breathtaking Adriatic Sea, picturing themselves as Ottoman warriors preparing to loot a wealthy kingdom of the past.

Situated in the heart of Zagreb, Croatia, the work would mark the center of a solar system model, unbeknownst to most locals. The large, polished sphere became a well known landmark in the city and in 2004, artist Davor Preis created metal models of the planets in scale with the established sun and placed them at relative distances around the city. Once completed, the system was in scale 1:680,000,000 to the actual solar system.

38,Pula Arena,"Pula, Croatia","One of the best-preserved Roman amphitheaters is still used today, but for less brutal events.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pula-arena,"It’s well known that the Romans constructed hundreds of amphitheaters across their vast empire. These marvels of architecture can be found in Europe, Northern Africa, and the Middle East. Among them, the Pula Arena is one of the best-preserved. It’s also the 6th largest amphitheater still standing and the only arena to retain its four side towers. The arena was constructed somewhere between 27 BC and the year 68. During this time the city of Pula, then known as Pietas Julia, was establishing itself as an important city in the empire. The amphitheater was originally composed of timber and was later replaced by stone. The name of the arena comes from the word rena, meaning sand in Latin, as the inner space was once covered in sand. For centuries, the theatre was used to accommodate gladiatorial fights until the 5th century when they were prohibited by emperor Honorius. However, combats between convicts and wild animals continued until the 7th century. During the Middle Ages, the arena was used for grazing, fairs, and tournaments. As with many other Roman amphitheaters during this period, the arena was partially deconstructed and the stones were used for other buildings. In 1583, the theatre was proposed for deconstruction and reconstruction near Venice. The proposal was rejected, and a headstone celebrating Venetian senator Gabriele Emo’s opposition was built on one of the towers surrounding the amphitheater. The arena was restored in the early 19th-century and since the 1930s it has been used for theater productions, concerts, public meetings, military ceremonies, and even ice hockey games. Every summer it plays host to the Pula Film Festival.",theaters roman ancient

It’s home to a number of castles, but the ruins of Croatia’s Pietrapelosa are among the best preserved in the area. The castle, which stands above the Bračana River Valley, is the second largest on the peninsula. Known for the moss that has always grown up its sides, its name is made up of the Italian words meaning “hairy stone.” Pietrapelosa was constructed during the Middle Ages. Its first mention is from around 965 AD. The castle was laid out in an elongated shape to work with the narrow ridge of the hill it sits on. The Gothic castle was surrounded by the three-story walls that still stand today. It once included a four-story watchtower and a chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene. The last service was performed there in 1793. Though most of the main building burned down in the 1620s, people continued to inhabit the fortress until it was eventually abandoned in the 18th century.",fortresses castles churches sacred spaces
40,Stone Flower,"Jasenovac, Croatia",Croatia's towering concrete blossom grows from the site of a World War II concentration camp.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-flower,"Created by famed sculptor Bogdan Bogdanović, the stylized Stone Flower in Jasenovac, Croatia is a dream-like cement construction where visitors can enter the roots of the massive flower to remember those who died in the concentration camp which once sat on the site. Completed in 1966, the five petals of cement are dedicated to the victims of the Jasenovac concentration camp which, unlike many of the more well-known Nazi camps, was not operated by the German regime but instead by the Croatian government of the time who were allied with the Reich. Despite the independent operation, the camp became one of the largest in Europe. While the exact number of victims who were killed in the camp is unknown it is now believed that as many as 800,000 people perished, many of them Serbians, who were being exterminated in an effort to create a “pure” Croatia. The horrifying camp was closed in 1945 and razed immediately afterward by former POWs. The Stone Flower that now stands on the site covers a tomb containing some remains that were exhumed from a nearby mass grave. The “roots” of the flower are open and people can head beneath the monument to see a group of plaques that have been placed there. Even though the grounds are gone and the name has been overshadowed by other sites, Bogdanović’s monument is a striking reminder of the atrocities that took place there.",nazis world war ii monuments military

While had been inhabited for hundreds of years previous, it was during World War II that Vis came under the control of Yugoslavian leader Josip Broz Tito, who began establishing new military fortifications around the island. The site had been the home of previous military bases as well, but it was not until Tito took the island for Yugoslavia that most of the major remaining structures were created. After WWII ended the island officially went to Yugoslavia and their army made it their central naval base, installing such features as an imposing concrete submarine dock that led right into the island hills, and long tunnels that ran under the surface. However when the island reverted to Croatian control in the early 1990’s, most of the structures were simply abandoned. Since the military use of the Vis installations ceased, many of the remaining structures were repurposed for civilian needs, while others simply remained empty. Today, Vis is a sleepy island that actually makes a fair amount of revenue from tourists eager to see the disregarded Cold War-era installations, as well as some of the islands more ancient features such as the classical artifacts displayed in the island’s central museum (itself housed in a disused base).",submarines naval history tunnels military history subterranean sites islands abandoned military

This decaying launch station was once an absolute powerhouse for the advancement of maritime weaponry. Rijeka, Croatia was where the first torpedoes were assembled and tested. The original launch station that stood atop the site was built in the 1860s. It allowed the city to become a key spot for manufacturing and testing the self-propelled underwater missiles. It was here that Robert Whitehead, working off Giovanni Luppis’ prototypes, created and launched the first successful torpedo. His fish-like machine revolutionized maritime military defenses. For 100 years, the factory churned out more than 30 different models. The launch station that stands today was constructed in the 1930s and was only in use for just over 30 years. The factory closed in 1966, putting an end to the site’s weaponry glory days. Now, the great launch station is basically falling apart; a shell of its former self.No longer a testing hub, its only visitors are the occasional urban explorer or fisherman.

In Soviet history books, World War II began in June 1941 when Nazi Germany broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (the treaty of non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union), and began advancing towards Moscow on the Eastern Front. Soviet allies and other Communist groups across Eastern Europe began preparing for the worst; and in Sisak, modern-day Croatia, members of the Yugoslav Communist Party formed the region’s first anti-fascist fighting brigade: the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment. According to the stories, these early Yugoslav partisans met in secret in the forest, beneath the shadow of an old elm tree. As the Nazis advanced on the Balkans, the group would go on to play an important role in Yugoslavia’s National Liberation Movement, destroying bridges, ammo stores, and disrupting Nazi supply lines. Immediately after the war, a commemorative plaque was set beneath the elm tree outside Sisak. In time the tree died, but in the 1970s plans were made to create a larger, more impressive memorial complex commemorating the spot where it had stood. The architect Želimir Janeš designed the main memorial structure, a 65-foot tower whose abstract shape was intended to resemble an elm tree. The memorial park was completed in 1981 with the main structure surrounded by smaller monuments, stones and memorial panels. During the last decade of socialist Yugoslav the Sisak Memorial Park was a popular destination, visited by domestic tourists and educational school trips alike. This all came to an end in the 1990s however, when Yugoslavia disintegrated and the region was ravaged by bloody wars fought along ethnic and religious fault lines. Since then, the site has fallen into neglect. Many of the smaller memorial features have disappeared, and plaques around the clearing show signs of damage by gunfire. The central tower still stands, however—and fresh white paint on one side of the monument shows that at least someone in these parts still cares for the place.",communist monuments communist architecture communism war memorial nazis war history world war ii memorials monuments military architecture

Rather than being abstract, ecstatic, or spontaneous, however, the art form, now called Naïve art, focused on the work of self-taught painters and sculptors who developed their own unique style as they developed their craft. The Croatian Museum of Naïve Art began life on November 1, 1952, as the Peasant Art Gallery. Its name was subsequently changed in 1956 to the Gallery of Primitive Art, and finally in 1994 to its current moniker. Clearly, it was an outsider art genre that struggled with nomenclature, but since its “official” arrival on the scene in the late 19th century, it had quickly gained popularity for its striking colors, atypical perspectives (both physical and political), uncomplicated presentation, and frequently strong emotional content. Naïve art became particularly popular in Croatia, where working- and middle-class people from the villages and countryside created the artwork that would form the first two major schools (the Earth Group and the Hlebine School) recognized in the movement. As the genre developed to include subjects from the rural or urban, the pastoral or political, and to encompass styles from poetic realism to romantic to surreal, the source always remained the same: autodidactic artists who, through untutored practice, created a refined style of their very own.It thus comes as little surprise that the Croatian Museum of Naïve Art was the first naïve art museum in the world holds 1,850 different paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints by (mostly Croatian) masters of the genre. However, the exhibition space is small — consisting of only 350 square meters on the first floor of the 18th-century Raffay Palace — thus allowing only 80 works to be on display at any time.",naive art outsider art museums and collections museums

The name of the valley derives from the Latin term limes, meaning limit, as the bay once marked the border between the Roman provinces of Italy and Dalmatia. This bay is technically a ria, a geological feature that forms when an unglaciated river valley becomes partially submerged, creating a coastal inlet. With a length of about seven miles (11.5 kilometers), it’s the largest ria in the Mediterranean Sea. The bay once formed the estuary of a now-extinct river that carved a 22 mile (35 kilometer) long valley that now extends all the way to the central part of the Istrian peninsula. The sea depth in the bay is well over 50 feet, with steep hills on opposite sides. A curious feature of the valley is that the vegetation on each side of the landscape differs, a result of the varying exposure to sunlight. On the north side, the flora consists of mostly evergreen plants, while the south bank is covered with deciduous trees. Lim bay is also a breeding ground and wintering area for various fish species and is rich with mussels and oysters.",water geology history & culture

50,The Zenobia Shipwreck,"Larnaca, Cyprus",The water here is so clear you can see the mysteriously sunken ship from the surface.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-zenobia-shipwreck-larnaca-cyprus,"The Zenobia was a large RO ferry that sank—some say in mysterious circumstances—on its maiden voyage in 1980. The massive wreck has since become a major diving destination, but you don’t have to scuba dive in order to see it. The water is so clear you can see it just from snorkeling at the surface, or even from a glass-bottomed boat. The ship capsized during its voyage from Malmö to Syria. As the ferry neared Greece, it began listing to port; apparently a computer malfunction was causing excess water to be pumped into the ballast tanks. With the problem seemingly under control, the ship then continued to Cyprus. While in Larnaca harbor, however, the listing recurred and the captain was ordered to take the ferry out of the harbor in case it sank and became a hazard to other ships. Anchored offshore, the list increased and the captain ordered the crew off the ship. In the early hours of June 7, 1980, the Zenobia capsized and sank. According to some locals, many of the crew were calmly watching this happen from a harbor-side bar. Part of the mystery of this wreck is that despite the vessel’s own value and the hundreds of millions of dollars of cargo it carried, no investigation was ever carried out, and it is said that the owners never tried to collect the insurance. The ferry was loaded with around 100 trucks, and the vehicles and their cargo are still on board, between 50 and 140 feet below the surface of the sea. Diving and snorkeling can be booked in Larnaca but even if staying in Paphos at the other end of the island dive centers will organize guided trips including transport. Glass-bottomed boat trips are available from Larnaca harbor. Based on two separate dive trips five years apart, the fish life on the wreck appears to be getting better with time, but the numbers of divers on the wreck now makes it seem quite crowded.",shipwrecks mystery water

Located in the Kato Paphos region of Cyprus, the ancient floor mosaics are considered amongst the finest in the world, serving as a valuable and beautiful record of everyday life of the Greco-Romans as well as the legends of gods, goddesses, and heroes. Visitors cannot fail to be astounded by the quality of them, particularly the later ones. Floor mosaics were an important component of houses and palaces of the elite in antiquity. Discovered by archaeologists as recently as the 1960s, the mosaics that remain today are from houses of different eras between the second and fourth centuries CE, beginning with the Hellenistic period and extending until the Byzantine era. Though a large number of houses and the mosaics within were destroyed over the centuries, five houses with large sections of mosaics with varying levels of damage can be seen at Paphos. The mansions are named after the recurring theme found in the mosaics inside: the House of Dionysus, the House of Theseus, the House of Aion, the House of Orpheus, and the House of The Four Seasons. Upon entering the House of Dionysus, you are welcomed with a mosaic of Scylla, a mythical sea monster. The craftsmen used the spaces to tell and retell the stories of figures like Hercules, who is the subject of a mosaic in the house of Orpheus. Theseus’s battle with the Minotaur can also be seen in a mosaic excavated from the House of Theseus. The ancient mosaics an important part of the Paphos Archaeological Park, a World Heritage Site. A conservation project was undertaken in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to try and undo the damage caused by centuries of erosion. Shelters were also erected to protect the mosaics as well as provide visitors some respite from the strong Mediterranean sun. If you go here in summer it is essential to take some water.

Construction originally began on the monastery in 327 on the island of Cyprus under the patronage of Saint Helena. As legend has it, a terrible drought afflicted the island during this time, allowing venomous snakes to proliferate, driving off not only the builders of the monastery, but even island locals. Helena’s solution to the infestation was to fight snakes with cats, and she had 1,000 of the furry killers shipped to the island from Persia and Egypt. Soon the savior had trained the felines to react to two bells: one signaling feeding time, and the other signaling snake hunting time. After battles that reportedly left the cats missing eyes and noses, the snakes were all but eradicated from the island and the monastery was completed. Although the original building was destroyed and rebuilt a number of times over the ensuing centuries, the cats on the island remained, and even flourished into an unofficial sub-breed known as the “Cyprus cat.” When the modern incarnation of the monastery was given over to a group of nuns in 1983, the church grounds themselves had become devoid of cats, and the snakes had returned. Unsurprisingly, the sisters took a page from history and brought in even more outside cats which quickly contained the problem. In addition to the newly imported animals, the Holy Monastery of Saint Nicholas of the Cats began taking in any stray cat brought to them in honor of the felines’ centuries of service.",snakes cats monasteries churches sacred spaces animals

But step inside, and you’ll enter a space filled with breathtaking Byzantine paintings. Panagia tu Araka is one of Cyprus’ painted churches. It was built in the 12th century as part of a monastery, and its interior is an exceptional example of Byzantine art. Gorgeous, vibrant murals cover the church’s ceiling and walls. Colorful images of Biblical figures stand out against an indigo background. The quality of the centuries-old art is astounding, and it’s all been incredibly well preserved. In fact, the building boasts the most complete set of frescoes from Cyprus’ Middle Byzantine period. Amazingly, the paintings managed to survive even as the building expanded and was renovated over the centuries. It’s believed most of the murals were painted around 1192 by Theodoros Apsevdis, though the two near the altar are thought to be a bit older and painted by someone else. The image of the Virgin Mary that adorns the blind arch above the entrance was painted in the 14th century, and the picture of the saints on the exterior north wall were added in 1673. The exterior of the church is interesting, too. Though the actual church itself is made of stone, a protective timber roof was added sometime in the 14th century. The monastery was in use until the early 19th century. Thankfully, the building wasn’t allowed to fall into disrepair and the beautiful artwork inside has been protected and preserved.

Known as Αλυκή Λάρνακας in Greek and Larnaka Tuz Gölü in Turkish, this shimmering, otherworldly lake is actually a complex of wetlands: Alyki, Orphani, Soros, and Spiro, in decreasing order of size. Only the largest, Alyki, is a true salt lake. In total, the wetlands and lake comprise 4,352 acres (1,761 hectares). Though this briny body of water is actually smaller than Limassol Salt Lake—making it the second largest of its kind on Cyprus—it is arguably the most significant. The small Mediterranean island’s summers don’t see much precipitation. Consequently, the lake becomes so dry that in certain areas, all that is left is an exposed layer of caked salt. Come winter, though, heavy rains inundate the island, and the lake fills again. In these waters, ostracods (seed shrimp), Branchinella spinosa (fairy shrimp), and Artemia salina (a species of brine shrimp) propagate and are an essential source of food for the flamingos that use the island as a rest stop during their annual migration. Wild ducks and gulls also frequent the lakes, availing themselves of the salty snacks found therein. In addition to its significance as a biotope, Larnaca Salt Lake and its environs are historically important. Before sediment deposit cordoned off the salt lakes, they formed a lagoon that was connected to the Mediterranean Sea. This lagoon was Cyprus’s largest cove and was used as a port during the second millennium BC. Larnaca, which was known as Kition, was among the most important trading posts in the ancient world—hardly surprising, given its strategic location in waters easily accessible from Africa, Asia, and Europe. There is even evidence that as the two natural channels connecting the lagoon to the sea become increasingly shallow due to aggregating particulate, Bronze Age Cypriots dug a human-made channel so as to keep the port city in operation. Beyond its convenience and accessibility, the harbor was important because of Kitium’s huge salt-exporting business. While this information has given rise to the impression that Larnaca Salt Lake’s saline nature is a result of sea water, this is actually not the case. Water from seasonal rains fills the area, which eventually dissolves a huge underground reserve of salt. Once the water evaporates, the remaining salt to water ratio is increased, resulting in a flat plain of dry salt during the driest months. The lake also features prominently in Christian and Muslim lore. Christians believe that a hungry and thirsty Saint Lazarus asked a wealthy vineyard owner for nourishment, and she lied, saying that her vines were dry. For her coldhearted greed, Lazarus supposedly cursed her land to become a salt lake. For Muslims, the area is important because Hala Sultan Tekke, also known as the mosque of Umm Haram, sits on the edge of the lake. This mosque serves as a shrine to Ubada bint al-Samit, a companion (some say wet nurse and foster mother, though this is disputed) of Mohammed. She is rumored to have died here by falling off a mule during the caliph Muawiyah I’s invasion of Cyprus in 647. Later, the mosque became a residence for Sufi dervishes, who were known for worshipping God through beautiful dancing and chanting.  There are no public bathrooms nearby, so make sure to factor this into your travel plans. It's not a bad idea to bring a bottle of water. Definitely wear sunscreen!

The crusading King of England toasted the lavish ceremony with a swig of the sweet nectar and, legend has it, declared the drink “the wine of kings and king of wines.” Commandaria, as the wine was called, still exists today, making it the world’s oldest manufactured wine. The dessert wine derives its name from “La Grande Commanderie,” the military headquarters of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitallers, two famed knightly orders that occupied Cyprus for hundreds of years during the Crusades from their base at Kolossi Castle, built in 1210. It could be expected that a castle home to such romantic stories of chivalric knights and wine fit for kings would exhibit an equally fantastical appearance. But in fact the image of fairytale European castles arose around the 1500s; Kolossi Castle predates these iconic structures by at least two centuries. Castles were originally built for military strategy, but after gunpowder came into prominence wealthy aristocrats built them as symbols of prestige and fantasy, crafting a starry-eyed view of the life of kings and queens from centuries past. In contrast, Kolossi Castle comes from a time of practical defense. It wasn’t built for style; it was built for war. The stronghold’s tower allowed for an unobstructed view of the countryside and its symmetrical structure provided broader sight-lines for detecting enemy armies. The knightly orders that built it were steadfast in their martial duties, prioritizing military strategy, not architectural beauty. This focus on security and defense was necessary in Cyprus to deter attempted enemy conquests, which it was burdened by for more than a millennium. Its strategic location in the Mediterranean meant that almost every empire sought to control it: the ancient Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Ottomans. Visiting Kolossi Castle today is about more than gazing at architectural beauty; it’s about standing in the footsteps of centuries of history. 14km west of Lemesos on the road towards Pafos (Paphos)",crusades wine castles military history military history
57,Varosha Beach Resort,"Famagusta, Cyprus","A 1970s resort city now stands abandoned, caught in the middle of a divided island.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/varosha,"In 1974, the Greek military junta backed a coup in Cyprus that sparked a Turkish invasion of the island. The Turkish forces advanced as far as the Atilla line, which is now the United Nations buffer-zone between the Greek and Turkish administrative areas of Cyprus. Located about two miles north of this buffer-zone was the beach resort city of Famagusta. In the early 1970s, Famagusta was one of the most popular beach holiday destinations in the world and was a favorite destination of the rich and famous. It was known for its sunny beaches, glamorous shopping and dining experiences, and excellent luxury hotels. But on July 20, 1974, at the height of the summer tourist season, the impending Turkish invasion suddenly drove all 39,000 inhabitants and hundreds of guests out of the city. Fearing a massacre, they fled and after a short battle, the city was taken by Turkish forces. Turkey remains in de facto possession of the city despite a bill attempting to return it to Greek control. The city is now home to around 40,000 inhabitants. The Varosha quarter, which was the tourism center of the city, has remained abandoned since the Turkish government fenced it off immediately after the conflict. Today, the district stands as a monument to what the world would look like without its human inhabitants. Tables are still set for breakfast, model 1970s cars still sit in their garages, and designer clothing still hangs on the racks of hastily abandoned shops. Nature has begun to take over, and many of the buildings are slowly collapsing, the cars rusting, the pavement cracking and overgrown with weeds. The Varosha Quarter is only accessible to Turkish military forces, the occasional journalist, and UN officials. It is also being used by writers and scientists as an ongoing study of how cities fare after their inhabitants have disappeared. Update as of October 2020: The breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus began to reopen sections of the beachfront at Varosha. It is possible to walk in parts of the city, between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm. There are bikes to rent in the area, as the distance can be quite long, especially during a warm summer day.  2 miles North of border between Turkish and Greek territories",beaches ghost towns islands abandoned ruins
58,Ancient Sex Curse of Cyprus,"Agios Tychon, Cyprus",Sex curse discovered on ancient tablet in Cyprus.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-sex-curse,"In 2008 archaeologists unexpectedly found a curse inscribed in Greek on a lead tablet from the old city kingdom of Amathus on the southern coast of Cyprus. It was simple and straightforward:“May your penis hurt when you make love.” The inscription dates back to the 7th century AD when Christianity was well established on the island. The tablet also shows a man standing and holding in his right hand something that looks like an hourglass. Pierre Aubuert, the head of Athens Archaeological School in Greece, believes that this curse may have referred to the activity of witchcraft or shamans surviving from the pre-Christian pagan era. However, the true reasoning behind the curse remains unknown, and it seems little follow-up research has been conducted.",cursed objects erotic strange science ruins
59,Foinikas,"Finike, Cyprus",A crumbling ghost town with prime views of the dam that doomed it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/foinikas-ghost-town,"These ruins add a sort of poetic, forlorn beauty to the land. The contrast between the abandoned village and verdant terrain is especially poignant in the spring, when flowers crop up amid the lush greenery that sprouts up around the crumbling stones. People have called this small patch of earth home for centuries. The settlement was supposedly founded by the Knights Templar in the 12th century after the island was invaded by King Richard the Lionheart of England during the Third Crusade. For many years, the village was home to a number of Turkish Cypriots. However, the hostile conditions following the 1974 coup d’état and subsequent Turkish invasion caused them to flee. After they left, the government resettled displaced Greek Cypriots within the village. But, they, too, were eventually forced to vacate. The government decided to build a dam in the nearby river, which would warp the environment and render the settlement prone to floods and unsafe to inhabit. Now, the village is a ghost town. The abandoned structures face prime views of the very dam that damned them into abandonment. Old stone houses and slightly newer, more modern models alike erode and decay. The weathered buildings stand like sad, forgotten memorials to the people who once called the settlement home.",abandoned houses villages ghost towns abandoned ruins

With the high Kyrenia mountains separating the seaside from the central plain, the castle provides an impressive view of the city and the narrow strip of land between the mountains and the Mediterranean. Like many other places in Cyprus, the castle has changed hands frequently. Built by the Byzantines, it was enlarged when the House of Lusignan ruled Cyprus. By the time the Venetians took control of what is now Kyrenia, troops had withdrawn from the castle and parts of it were dismantled. The castle itself sits high atop a mountain range, with three main defensive units at different elevations. One of the castles outer walls is still very well preserved and provides a perimeter to this day. Many areas of the former living quarters and towers at the lower levels showcase the original size of the fortification. Legend has it that a group of hired Bulgarian mercenaries for John of Antioch were thrown from the tower for alleged treason. Today, a friendly cut-out knight congratulates you on reaching the top. The castle remained quiet for years, until the 20th century. In 1974, during the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish troops after a Greek-led Coup d’État, the castle was the site of a battle near the pass between Kyrenia and Nicosia.  Make sure to wear adequate footwear, not all areas of the castle are level and you are occasionally walking on rocks with centuries of wear and tear.

Though small and unassuming, it offers a fascinating glimpse into what doctors, nurses, and patients had to work with in the days before modern medicine, from antiquity up to the 20th century. The museum displays a unique collection of treasures including old equipment, curious contraptions, and odd pieces of medical history. Some highlights include stone dildos (“phallic items”) from ancient Kition; illustrated documents containing medial poems and curses; an OBGYN bench reportedly used by over half of Larnaca’s original population; and a replica of the Hippocratic Ladder, a wooden ladder used to treat dislocations of the hip or of the neck. The museum was founded in 2011 by Marios Kyriazis, a private collector who inherited many of these artifacts from his grandfather and great-grandfather. Aside from the museum’s permanent exhibition, it also hosts cultural events, public lectures, and all sorts of activities revolving around medical interests. The museum also has a lovely outdoor garden where healing herbs such as lavender, basil, sage and melissa are planted and health drinks are served.

62,Cyprus Buffer Zone,"Nicosia, Cyprus",This no man's land slicing through the island is strewn with abandoned relics of another time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/un-buffer-zone-cyprus-green-line,"A Buffer Zone controlled by the United Nations cuts across the island of Cyprus, dividing the country’s population in two, with ethnic Greek Cypriots in the south and ethnic Turkish Cypriots in the north. Also called “the Green Line,” this demilitarized zone was established in its current form in 1974, following the ceasefire after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Although this Buffer Zone runs all the way through the country, the section dividing the capital city of Nicosia is the most palpable, as all roads running on a north-south axis come to a dead end. At times, they terminate with a passport checkpoint. Others end with fortified guard huts. And rarely, but surely, some sections are badly fenced and unguarded, tempting short, forbidden visits within the UN-patrolled no man’s land. The Green Line stretches some 112 miles across the island. In some parts, the zone is no more than several feet wide. Other sections have been normalized, and are even home to thousands of Cypriots living within the zone and farming the land. One village inside the Buffer Zone, called Pyla, is the only place in the country where Greek and Turkish Cypriots live side-by-side. In the areas where the demilitarized line cuts through the capital, the zone is strewn with abandoned buildings, gardens, vehicles, and even the decaying Nicosia International Airport. These crumbling relics have sat neglected for over 40 years, and now serve as a chilling time capsule of a former life in Cyprus.  The Buffer Zone is off-limits to the public, but the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) may permit visits on a case-by-case basis to researchers, photographers, and others. More information and the Visit Request Form can be found at the UNFICYP website.

In this part of the island, black donkeys wander around freely and tease tourists. The donkeys are there because of the island’s complicated late 20th-century history. In 1974, tension between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots escalated. A Greek Cypriot military coup followed by attacks on the Turkish Cypriot community caused the Turkish army to enter the island. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus then formed. The crossing point between the two states only opened in 2004. When the Greek Cypriots left the northeast part of the country, they left everything behind—including their donkeys. These donkeys started roaming around freely and, of course, reproducing. Today, you can still find them in the protected area on the most northern part of the island. Entering Dipkarpaz National Park requires passing through Karpasia National Park first. A curling road that slowly rises allows people to enter Dipkarpaz, where black donkeys usually wait near the entrance. When you reach the top of the road, glance down and you’ll see travelers on the long beautiful Golden Beach. Once you’re in the park, you’ll also have access to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery. This place’s destiny changed when St. Andrew’s ship allegedly crashed into rocks and the captain’s blind eye was healed after he came ashore. You’ll find people making wishes by lighting long, thin candles. Not surprisingly, donkeys walk around in the church garden waiting to be fed.  The best way to go to this untouched part of Cyprus is to rent a car. There are no big hotels due to preservation rules, so you can stay in bungalows or trailers.",donkeys national parks islands animals

The entire island of Cyprus is split by a jagged horizontal line, with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the top and the Republic of Cyprus on the bottom. The division is an official United Nations Buffer Zone, and it was closed to the civilian population until 2003. Today, Cypriots and tourists alike can move between the north and south of Cyprus via a handful of designated checkpoints. Phaneromenis 70 is a five-minute walk from the Lidras Street checkpoint in the Greek Cypriot half of Nicosia. It’s easy to overlook this shop due to its understated sign and location amid many bustling cafes. However, once you step inside you will find a hidden abundance of creativity. This shop, founded by Cypriot artist Kyriaki Costa, showcases goods from local artists who work in ceramics, jewelry, printmaking, drawing, painting, and textiles. Most of the artwork displays a unique combination of ancient archaeology (think traditional Roman sculptures and Greek terra-cotta vases) with a smirkingly modern twist. Additionally, Phaneromenis 70 publishes Delivering Views, a serial cultural publication that shows Nicosia through the eyes of foreign visitors. There have been 24 chapters of Delivering Views thus far, and each one features a different visitor, along with his or her unique take on Cypriot culture expressed in the mediums of photography and writing.

Rail travel, on the other hand, is something rarely associated with the Mediterranean island. Yet between 1905 and 1951, the Cyprus Government Railway (CGR) carried more than 7 million passengers and an excess of 3 million tons of goods across the country. Alongside passengers and goods, the CGR was an essential mail delivery tool and played a significant part in moving troops and ammunitions during World War II. Despite its important role, the CGR couldn’t compete with the rising popularity of road transportation and, on December 31, 1951, Locomotive No. 1, which had hauled the island’s first train in 1905, departed the Nicosia station for the final time. Trains stopped pulling into Evrychou 20 years earlier, when the last five miles of the CGR were abandoned due to lack of profits. The Evrychou railway station was transformed into a health center and later a forest services dormitory. It was also once burned and damaged by the EOKA Greek Cypriot nationalist guerrilla fighters because it was erected by the British. Now the building has returned to its original glory to house the Cyprus Railways Museum, which opened in September of 2016. Proudly perched along the edge of the village, the sandstone station gleams expectantly, as if a train will arrive at any moment. The museum is spread over two floors within the former station and offers a comprehensive overview of the history, operation, and legacy of the CGR. Using original documents, photographs, posters, and drawings, as well as scale models of the locomotives, rolling stock, and stations, the free attraction does its best to transport visitors back to the early 20th century, with period furniture helping conjure an image of the station’s initial days. Outside the building, surrounded by a manicured garden, you can also see more than 300 feet of original track. Laid in a Y-shape, the rails were discovered within the station during renovations and have been carefully returned to their proper home on the ground. Beyond the platform, an original handcar and freight wagon are exhibited in a shed outside. Despite government support, the museum has clearly been a passion project for a small group of islanders, including a group of British expats, whose names are engraved on a plaque in the entrance hall, and their personal collections are displayed throughout. Summer hours (mid April to mid September) are Monday through Sunday, 9:30 to 5:00. Winter hours (mid September to mid April) are Monday through Sunday, 8:30 to 4:00.

Omodos, a quaint village in the Troödos Mountains, is a fine example: In addition to its vineyards, it is also home to the Omodos Wine Press (Linos tou Charilaou), a stunning medieval artifact. Down the street from Timios Stavros Monastery is a small room filled with medieval winemaking paraphernalia such as vats, cauldrons, various tools, and, at the center, the impressive Omodos Wine Press. According to an interview with the current owner, the winemaking site is 700 to 800 years old. The most imposing part of the Omodos Wine Press is the enormous double wooden beam that spans across the room. Attached to one end of the beam is a giant wooden screw weighed down by a large stone that can be raised and lowered by means of a pulley. In the medieval era, workers would place grapes on a large tray beneath the beam and cover them with planks. As two people rotated the screw, the heavy stone would rise and the beam would sink and press the grapes. Juice then seeped into half-buried vats—which would be sealed to prevent spoilage—for fermentation. Although wineries in Omodos no longer use this traditional grape-pressing method, they still use local varieties of grapes such as Xynisteri and Mavro, which can be sampled from a wealth of outlets scattered throughout Omodos.",fermentation fermented food food museums wine alcohol medieval museums

Built it 1957 in the middle of nowhere near the coast of Northern Cyprus, the retro-chic villa is still furnished as it was in the 1970s when the owner is rumored to have escaped capture by fleeing through a hidden tunnel behind his bed. Now a museum, Mavi Köşk feels more like snooping around in someone’s home. Though its history is a blurry mix of myth and truth, it’s believed the house was built by a Paulo Paolides, a Greek Cypriot who was rumored to work for the Italian mafia smuggling guns into Cyprus, and the decor is a glimpse into the glamorous if eccentric lifestyle of the supposed mobster. As the name suggests, there is a clear blue theme throughout the multicolor home, with bright blue furniture, carpets, walls, and entire blue rooms. The house is full of perfectly kitsch features, such as the sunken blue “milk pool” in the living area and the iguana skin-covered drinks cabinet. Upstairs, you can visit the balcony where Paolides would supposedly throw an apple during parties and invite whoever caught the fruit to spend the evening with him. You can also take in the spectacular view, which stretches as far as the coast of Turkey on a clear day. Paolides lived in the Blue House until 1974 when he fled during the Turkish invasion. The Turkish army took control of the residence, which was later opened to the public as a museum.  You must wear blue overshoes when visiting the Blue House, and these are provided. It is also inside a military zone, so passports will need to be left at the entrance and are returned to you when you leave. Don't forget to take your passport with you.

Documents reveal that its original name was Yeni Han (New Inn). Due to the high number of patrons from Alanya, it became known as Alanyalılar Hanı, but during the 17th-century, a smaller inn was opened nearby. People began referring to the two places as the Small Inn and the Big Inn, or Büyük Hanı, which eventually became Büyük Han. The purpose of the caravanserai was to provide shelter for travelers, however, under British rule, Büyük Han was used as a prison from 1892 to 1903. Once the prison was decommissioned, Büyük Han once again became an inn and shops started appearing on the ground floor. It wasn’t until the 1990s that a full restoration took place, and Büyük Han became a vital cultural and social center of urban life. Two gates grant access to the courtyard, one facing east and one facing west. From the outside, Büyük Han looks austere and it reminds one of a fortress. Upon entering, the eye is met with a large courtyard surrounded by a two-story stone structure adorned by elegant arches and stairs. On the ground floor, once dedicated to stables and storage rooms, are now fashionable cafes and art shops. The sleeping chambers, traditionally located on the first floor, are now home to merchants and artisans selling their wares and services. Each of the 68 rooms has an octagonal or hexagonal fireplace, the shape of which created some puzzlement among historians. In the center of the courtyard is a two-story prayer room (köşk mescidi) resting on top of marble piers, with a fountain for ablutions.

The camp hosted Cypriot resistance fighters in the latter part of the 1950s, before Cyprus gained independence from Britain. From August 1946 to January 1949, the British government established and operated a dozen camps in Cyprus, which were used as detention centers for more than 50,000 illegal immigrants, mostly Holocaust survivors seeking to resettle in Palestine. These camps were shut down after the establishment of the state of Israel. But a decade later, the British built a new set of camps on the Mediterranean island. The Polemi Detention Center was one of eight British camps in Cyprus during the Cypriot War of Independence. From 1955 to 1959, the Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston (National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters), or EOKA, led an armed campaign against British colonial rule. Polemi opened near the end of the conflict and only operated for 102 days. But during that brief period, some 400 resistance fighters who were detained there experienced violence, cruelty, and torture. The camp was notorious for its horrific and inhumane conditions. In November 2017, 35 former EOKA fighters sought damages from the British government for the human rights abuses they experienced during the war. Today, the site of the former concentration camp is barren. A few structures remain, including a guard tower, some old military vehicles.

The Nicosia airport was built in the 1930s as a military airfield and slowly grew into a fairly modern-for-the-1970s facility. While not the largest airport in the world, the little facility began as a small collection of sheet metal huts before growing into multiple terminals servicing multiple air travel companies. However, despite the success of the airport, when Greek nationalists staged a coup in the country, overthrowing the leader and taking over the airport, it quickly became a focal point of the fighting. When Turkish forces invaded the country in 1974, and a demilitarized zone was created, the airport landed smack in the middle of it, causing its immediate closure and sudden abandonment. Since its closure in 1974, the airport has simply sat fallow. The United Nations took control over the demilitarized area, which is now closed to civilians, but the airport and its terminals remained for the elements to take over.

Cyprus’ mining history began around 4,000 BC with the production of copper. The people who lived on the island thousands of years ago were incredibly skilled metalworkers. The lucrative orange metal (cuprum in Latin) was even named after the Greek name for Cyprus (Kúpros). During the Roman era, the metal extracted from the earth there were able to satisfy nearly all of the empire’s copper requirements. When the Roman Empire fell, the mining industry also ground to a halt. The industry remained dormant up until the 19th century, when Great Britain colonized the island and revived the mines. But as it turns out, for many of the reopened (and newly opened) mines their resurrections were short-lived. A combination of environmental issues, falling prices, political turmoil, and resource exhaustion caused a number of the mines to close once again. The abandoned Kokkinopezoula and Kokkinoyia mines near the village of Mitsero offer up-close looks at the island’s historic industry. Both are part of a UNESCO Geopark. At the Kokkinopezoula mine, scarred tiers of earth descend toward a lake with a strange red hue. At the Kokkinoyia mine, visitors can see parts of a railway line and a portion of one of the tunnels. A poignant poem by Kostas Montis is engraved on a stone at its entrance, which roughly translated reads: “The mine … where the man of the sun and wind, crawls like the worm to find or not find again the hole open that will take him back to life … the mine that became a curse and accusation, legend and history. This that theater and cinema the novel and the song have made spider webs around its dark existence.” Update as of January 2023: Mitsero Mine is still accessible, although fences have been erected around the site.

As king of much of eastern Europe and eventually Holy Roman Emperor during the 16th century, Rudolf II was not known as an especially effective ruler, but he is widely remembered for his interest and patronage of the occult arts. It was during his reign that he turned Prague into the unofficial capital of the dark arts. Funding a number of alchemists and other so-called sorcerers, most notably the likes of Edward Kelley and John Dee, Rudolf created possibly the most active period of occult practice in history. Whether or not his patrons were simply charlatans wrapped in mystery (which they probably were), or bold proto-scientists, the legacy of these magicians and madmen is remembered with a carnival flair at The Museum of Alchemists and Magicians of Old Prague. Consisting of two levels of displays and tableaux, the exhibits trace the history of Rudolf’s alchemists in the city, especially Kelley. The main floor has displays and replica artifacts of the trade alongside such fantastical scenes as a failed magician being stolen up into the ceiling by the Devil while cackling sorcerers huddle around the glowing runes beneath. The second floor, which claims to be the actual tower where the real Kelley performed his esoteric experiments, is decked out like an alchemist’s lab, all aged scrolls and stacked grimoires, complete with a half-completed homunculus, the ultimate alchemical achievement. The museum is more than a little sensational in its presentation, but to be fair, these alchemists were likely more than a little bit showmen themselves.

It was built in 1140 and has been rebuilt numerous times since, due to the ravages of various wars. It is likely not the monastery itself, nor its church, however, that astonishes visitors. That distinction goes to the the library within its walls. The library is divided into two major halls: the Baroque Theological Hall contains 18,000 religious texts, and the grand Philosophical Hall has over 42,000 ancient philosophical texts. The libraries hold many rare volumes, are masterfully frescoed, and contain 17th-century geographical globes. Above the shelves of the Theological Hall are gilded wooded-carved decorations with wooden cartouches. These functioned as a sort of beautiful early card catalogue system. The pictures in the wooden cartouches and their titles specified the type of literature stored on the shelves below. Of special note is the compilation wheel, used by 17th-century scribes to compile texts. The scribe would place various texts that he needed to copy from on the wheel, which functioned as a kind of rotating shelf. A planetary mechanism inside ensured that the books were always held at the same angle, even as they spun around. Strahov also contains a beautiful cabinet of curiosities, brought to the monastery from the estate of Karel Jan Erben in 1798. The hall of cabinets include bits of a dodo bird, a large 18th-century electrostatic device, numerous old ocean specimens, insects, minerals, anthropological artifacts, and for unclear reasons, many glass cases full of wax fruit.

76,Idiom Installation,"Prague, Czechia",A Jenga-style cylindrical tower of books that appears to go on forever.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/idiom-installation,"For bibliophiles, an infinite tower of books is a nightmare disguised as a dream—a huge collection of literature that you can’t get at because pulling a book or two out will cause the collapse of the tower. But it does make for a wonderful sight. A real-life iteration of this dream-nightmare is on display at the Prague Municipal Library. Artist Matej Kren’s “Idiom” is a long-term art installation where hundreds of books are stacked in a cylindrical tower. Mirrors placed at the bottom and the top give the exhibit the illusion of being infinite. A tear-shaped opening on one side of the tower allows visitors to peek in and experience what it would be like to drown in a book well. Idiom was originally displayed at the Sao Paulo International Biennial in 1995, and found a permanent home in the entrance hall of the Czech library in 1998. This literary wormhole has become a local landmark in its own right, even featured on the cover of Science magazine in 2011. Kren, who was born in Trencin, Slovakia, explores the theme of infinite knowledge offered by books in many of his works. “Gravity Mixer” is another book-themed installation, where Kren created a rotunda of books, and “Passage” in Bratislava is an endless looming wall of literature.",wells installations books literature art
77,Prague Astronomical Clock,"Prague, Czechia",Macabre astrological automaton clock dating to the late 1400s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prague-astronomical-clock,"The legend of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town of Prague seems to have come straight from the Brothers Grimm. The dark tale is set in the fifteenth century, when the clock is said to have been created by the great clockmaker Mikuláš from Kadaň. Such was the reputation of his craftsmanship that Mikuláš was approached by many a foreign nation, each wishing to have its own town square topped with a marvelous astronomical clock. Mikuláš refused to show the plans of his masterpiece to anyone, but word got back to the Prague Councilors. Overcome with fear that Mikuláš might build a bigger, better, and more beautiful clock for another nation, the Councilors had the brilliant clockmaker blinded, ensuring that their clock would never be topped. Driven mad, the clockmaker took the ultimate revenge, throwing himself into his extraordinary work of art, gumming up the clock’s gears and ending his own life in one stroke. In doing so, he cursed the clock. All who tried to fix it would either go insane, or die. While this is only a legend, it stands as a testament to the extraordinary nature of the Prague Astronomical Clock. The clock has been modified, destroyed, and repaired many times since its creation in 1380. It is perhaps the most well-known astronomical clock in the world, with four moving automatons (including a skeleton ringing his death knell for each hour), and rotating statues of the 12 apostles. It displays Babylonian time, Old Bohemian time, German time, and Sidereal time. It also shows the moon’s phases and the sun’s journey through the constellations of the zodiac. The calendar dial, just below the clock, shows the day of the month, the day of the week, feast days and allegorical pictures of the current month and sign of the zodiac. Though the legend of Mikuláš is apocryphal, Prague is not without a dark history - the cobblestones of the Old Town Square below the clock are marked with 27 crosses commemorating 27 beheaded Czech noblemen. Be sure to go upstairs for a tour of the interior of the fascinating clock. In Czechia, the Prague Astronomical Clock is known simply as the Orloj, from the Latin word horologium. As the saying goes, imitation is the highest form of flattery. When it was created, the Prague Astronomical Clock was an outstanding technological achievement. In modern times, Koreans fascinated by the Orloj built a working replica of the clock and the tower of the Old Town Hall. Their building in Seoul is called Castle Praha Hongdae. Update January 2019: After nine months of restoration—the most extensive since the 1940s—the clock has been returned to its former glory and is back on view.  There are free walking tours available to the area, also check out the main visitors and climb the main tower for amazing views of the square and city.",astronomical clocks amazing automata astounding timepieces clocks inventions eccentric homes homes architectural oddities architecture
78,Dripstone Wall,"Prague, Czechia",Countless grotesque faces stare out from this eerie Prague art wall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dripstone-wall-2,"Resting at the heart of Prague’s baroque palace grounds is a famously eerie wall, surrounded by lush gardens. Constructed at the behest of Albrecht von Wallenstein between 1623 and 1630, the Wallenstein Palace enjoyed a centuries-long first life as a magnificent private residence for various generations of the Wallenstein family. At the close of World War II, the land fell into the hands of the state government, who repurposed the palace’s main buildings to serve as the seat of operation for the Senate of Czechia. Despite the elite negotiations that have always taken place inside the palace’s handsome corridors, it is the Wallenstein Palace’s massive network of complex, geometric gardens that remain the biggest draw for the public since 2002. Fashioned in an early baroque style, the grounds were partitioned into several distinct areas, the most secluded and fascinating of which was known as “The Grotto.” In this portion of the garden, aspects of real and artificial elements of nature co-mingle, creating an eerily unreal landscape. Here, grotesques were allowed to reign supreme, including imagery of snakes, monsters, and random, distorted faces, while an aviary provided a crucial acoustic element. Contemporary visitors to the Grotto remain most struck by the Dripstone Wall, created by things that, from a distance, seem to be dripping skulls. Closer investigation reveals the wall is made from a haunting, uncanny assemblage of stalactite-like rocks. Signs along the wall note that, if one stares hard enough, it’s possible to make out human and animal faces peering out from within the wall’s recesses. Adding further fuel to the site’s disconcerting nature are other strategically placed clues that the Dripstone Wall itself could, perhaps, contain secret passageways wending through its interior, accessible only by those bright enough to discern the pattern of access. Throughout nearly 500 years of years of existence, no one seems to have found a way in, but, thankfully, that hasn’t yet stopped visitors from dreaming about solving the mystery.  The Dripstone Wall park is only open between April and October.",secret passages grottoes walls gardens plants
79,"Sedlec Ossuary ""Bone Church""","Kutna Hora, Czechia","A church of bones, decorated with 40,000 human skeletons.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sedlec-ossuary,"The 40,000 to 70,000 skeletons within Sedlec Ossuary (aka Kostnice Ossuary Beinhaus) in the Czech Republic welcome you, quite literally, with open arms. Known to most as “the Bone Church,” it displays some of the world’s more macabre art. In addition to a splendid bone chandelier composed of almost every bone in a human body, the ossuary displays two large bone chalices, four baroque bone candelabras, six enormous bone pyramids, two bone monstrances (a vessel used to display the Eucharistic host), a family crest in (you guessed it) bone, and skull candle holders. Festively looping chains of bone are hung throughout like crepe paper at a birthday party. Sedlec Ossuary has a long history, beginning in the 13th century when the Abbot of the Sedlec Monastery (Abbot Henry) brought a handful of earth back from a journey to the Grave of the Lord in Jerusalem. He scattered this “holy soil” across the Sedlec cemetery, securing its place as one of the most desired burial sites for people all over Bohemia and the surrounding countries. Everyone wanted to be buried in that handful of the Holy Land and more than 30,000 were. But it wasn’t long before there simply wasn’t enough room for everyone to rest in peace, and the bodies were moved to a crypt to make room for the newly dead. In 1870, a local woodcarver, František Rint was employed for the dark task of artistically arranging the thousands of bones. Rint came up with the Bone Church’s stunning chandelier, as well as the amazing Schwarzenberg coat of arms, which includes a raven pecking at the severed head of a Turk–all made of human bone. Rint was responsible for bleaching all of the bones in the ossuary in order to give the room a uniform look. His artist’s signature is still on the wall today–naturally, in his medium of choice, bone.  One hour train ride from Prague. It's much easier to take the train than the bus, as you can walk from the train station in Kutná Hora in about ten minutes. Kutna Hora is a small and quiet town.

The hide of the last black bear to be hunted in the outskirts of Prague lies on the floor. The real treasure is yet to come. Locate the small statue in the library and give it a twist. A secret door will open down onto a narrow set of stairs, which leads to an underground laboratory sprawling beneath.

While the museum is a re-creation, a bit gimmicky, and the trip through the secret door down into the basement is done with a tour guide it is nonetheless an unusual journey into Prague’s occult history.

81,Olšany Cemetery,"Prague, Czechia",Walk through Czech history in Prague's largest graveyard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/olsany-cemetery,"For a cemetery created in the hectic panic of a plague epidemic, Prague’s sprawling Olšany Cemetery is a beautifully planned public work. In the 17th century it was considered unhygienic to bury the corpses of plague victims within city limits, so a large cemetery was designated in 1680 for this very purpose. When plague struck again a century later, Emperor Joseph II enacted a series of hygiene reforms and Olšany became the city’s official cemetery. It was continually used up until the 20th century, when a number of elaborate art nouveau grave monuments made the cemetery a place for sightseers, not just mourners. Olšany Cemetery is the largest in Prague and one of the largest in Czechia. This is because it is comprised of 12 different sections. The New Jewish Cemetery was created to replace the Old Jewish Cemetery,  and included a small Orthodox section. An even smaller Muslim section sits on the opposite side of the graveyard. It is said that over 2 million people are buried here in over 60,000 grave sites.  A “Learning Trail” provides a historical walk through the graves. Visitors can walk from the 17th century graves at the north end of the cemetery to the filigreed mausoleums of the 20th century near the center. The crisply groomed military cemetery marks a stark contrast to the leaning, ivy-covered graves of earlier centuries. Soldiers from a range of conflicts are interred here, from the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century to World War II. Many Czech soldiers who died fighting for their country’s independence are buried here, and so are members of the Soviet Red Army who died fighting in Czechoslovakia. As per an agreement between Czechia and Russia, each maintains the graves of their former who died on their soil. Picturesque setting aside, people come to Olšany to pay their respects to their deceased loved ones as well as some famous figures in Czech history. A number of actors, writers, and painters are buried here, as are Jan Palach, a student who immolated himself in protest of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and Pavel Roman, one of the first celebrity ice skaters.  Cemetery hours are 8 a.m.-7 p.m. May-September, to 6 p.m. during March, April, & October, and to 5 p.m. November-February.",jews art nouveau judaism graveyards graves gravestones cemeteries monuments

The club was founded by František Sádra Chmelík and a small group of friends in 2002. At the time, it was a low-key private space for DJs and other Czech creatives to practice. Word spread quickly though, and the owners were able to raise over half a million Czech koruna via crowdfunding to expand the club. Over the course of a few years, the little rehearsal space grew into a three-floor factory churning out art, activism, and education, in addition to bangin’ electronic concerts. Most of the DJs who began Cross Club were dubstep, EDM, and/or breakbeat focused, but the club’s musical repertoire has expanded to include punk, ska, rockabilly, reggae, and myriad other styles. In addition to the musical offerings, Cross Club has a number of family friendly programs during the day. Children’s theater and puppet shows happen in the afternoon. The club’s “Ghettollege” program presents educational lectures on everything from Islamic theology to software programming. These are usually free of charge and open to the public. Other events include poetry readings, film screenings, and costume contests. There is also, of course, a bar and café in case you work up an appetite while dancing, learning, and exploring.",steampunk clubs dancing bars music
83,Old Jewish Cemetery,"Prague, Czechia","Around 100,000 bodies are buried below the medieval headstones, many of which mark graves with multiple bodies stacked up to 12 deep.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-jewish-cemetery-1,"The 12,000 headstones in the Old Jewish Cemetery are crumbling and covered with ivy, toppled and clustered together. This was not Prague’s first Jewish cemetery, but it is the oldest surviving in the city. The oldest burial date listed is 1439, though the cemetery was probably in use long before that, and the most recent burial was in 1787. Burials ceased when a new decree prohibited interment in areas where people lived because of health risks. The notoriously dirty neighborhood of Josefov, where the Jewish cemetery is located, underwent serious cleanup and reconstruction efforts. Part of the cemetery was displaced for a new road, which meant the dead and their headstones were exhumed and stuffed into empty spaces in the already crowded plots. There are upwards of 12,000 headstones in the cemetery, though it is speculated that as many as 100,000 individuals are buried beneath them, stacked 12 deep in some places. Jewish customs forbid the removal of old graves, so the dead were simply piled on top of one another for centuries. New dirt was even trucked in to create more earth for burials. As Prague was a hub of Jewish scholasticism in Eastern Europe, it’s no surprise that some of the foremost figures in Jewish history are buried here. Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, a central character in the myth of the golem, is buried beneath an ornate sand-colored headstone decorated with a lion. The astronomer David Gans has the Star of David and a goose on his. These symbols appear on the headstones of common graves as well. Along with the Hebrew script denoting the person buried below, the images engraved on the stones could communicate names (“Gans” means goose in German), professions (books for cantors; scissors for tailors), and characteristic traits (grapes for a full, prosperous life; the Star of David for devout Jews). During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, historic synagogues and other sites were destroyed, effectively erasing the physical traces of Jewish culture. However, the Old Jewish Cemetery and the thousands of artifacts collected by the Jewish Museum escaped this fate through dark but fortunate providence. It is believed that the Nazis wished to save these items for a “Museum of an Extinct Race” in Prague, which would inform people of the future about the Jewish race wiped out by the Aryans. Thankfully this museum and its subject did not come to fruition, and the cemetery, along with the artifacts of the Jewish Museum, were spared. Today, visitors can pay their respects to the thousands buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery through tours offered by Prague’s Jewish Museum. Hundreds of pebbles and prayers written on tiny papers can be found resting atop the gravestones. The attached museum has poems and pictures drawn by children during the Nazi occupation, as well as toys.    Keep in mind when you visit the Jewish Quarter and all Jewish museums and sights that these are closed on Saturdays (Sabbath) and Jewish holidays. Also keep in mind that there are often queues to view the cemetery (sometimes up to an hour or more). Tip: If you are in Prague for a few days and you plan to visit various tourist sites, purchase a Prague card. This is valid for different number of days and gives you free entry or reduction on the entry price. The cemetery can only be seen as a part of the tour and cost around €20.",judaism nazis medieval cemeteries

Perhaps that description makes the objects displayed in this erotic collection sound a little impersonal, but no worries—if a contraption in the collection is hard to wrap your brain around, the museum has been kind enough to wrap a flexible dummy around it to further demonstrate its use. Opening its doors in 2002 it is, to date, the only museum in the world dedicated to sex machines and sex machines exclusively. The museum has hundreds of sexytime contraptions, spread out over three floors of space. Alongside the copulation tables, iron corsets and assorted stimulation doodads, you will find a smattering of sex-related artifacts, some dating back as far as the early 16th century. There are also shoes worn by ancient Greek prostitutes, human sexuality photos, an unsettlingly large erotic apparatus from a German women’s prison created to placate “fervent feelings” of the inmates, and some of the earliest pornos ever filmed. The museum was popular from the get-go, but city officials found it “disagreeable.” Unsurprisingly, this made it all the more appealing, especially among tourists from more sexually-repressed locations.

85,Brown-Nosers,"Prague, Czechia",The risqué mixed-media sculptures are supposedly a metaphor for Czech politics.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brownnosers,"David Černý has a number of controversial, provocative sculptures scattered throughout Prague and the wider world. Of all of these, Brown-nosers is perhaps among his most not-safe-for-work exhibits. The sculptures are a permanent fixture hidden in the back garden of Futura, an art museum. The gigantic, naked lower halves of two bodies are bent over and lean against the side of the building, revealing their rather gaping orifices. Though their somewhat obscene appearance doesn’t make the figures look too inviting, Brown-nosers is actually an interactive, mixed-media exhibit. Viewers are invited to climb the ladder leading to the macroscopic derrieres and stick their heads inside the behemoth butts. But rather than being greeted with a slurry of some sort of sculpted internal sludge, as one might expect to find within an artistic anus, people will instead see a television screen that plays a video of two Czech politicians spoon feeding each other to the sounds of Queen’s “We Are the Champions.” Brown-nosers was erected in 2003. The approximately 17-foot-tall artwork is supposedly a metaphor for the state of Czech politics. Surprisingly, the giant sculptures can be a bit difficult to find—visitors to Futura must first wind their way through the building’s internal exhibits to reach the back garden.  Buses, trams, and metros bringing you near the place. The fastest way to get there is via the Anděl Prague Metro station and walk for about 15 minutes.

86,Tančící dům - Dancing House of Prague,"Prague, Czechia",This tipsy office building in downtown Prague was originally called “Fred and Ginger.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tancici-dum-the-dancing-house-of-prague,"When this seven-story building first went up in central Prague, its co-architect, the world-renowned Frank Gehry, dubbed it “Fred and Ginger,” calling to mind the elegance and wit of the famous film couple. Some local residents, not so enamored with the radical design, dubbed it “The Drunk House,” calling to mind a boozy Saturday night along the Vltava River. Over time the structure has built a few metaphorical bridges, and now it’s simply called “The Dancing House of Prague.” Completed in 1996, it took four years to build the Dancing House, designed by Croatian-Czech architect Vlado Milunić in cooperation with Gehry. It sits on land that fronts the river, surrounded by imposing 18th and 19th-century architecture. The previous building on the lot was destroyed during the bombing of Prague in 1945, in the waning days of World War II. It sat in a shattered state until the rubble was finally cleared in 1960. It took another 30 years before new life was breathed into the corner lot, championed by its nextdoor neighbor, President Václav Havel. Havel’s family had lived for decades on the block, and when construction began in 1992 he was serving as the last president of Czechoslovakia. His hope was to create a cultural center along the river. A lot happened during the four years of construction, including the Czech-Slovak split and Havel becoming the first president of Czechia. His support of the Milunić-Gehry co-venture sustained throughout, but the dream of a cultural center did not. The building was instead financed by the Dutch insurance giant Nationale-Nederlanden, and since opening its doors the Dancing House has been used as a post-modern office building. Gehry originally referred to the two columns as “Fred and Ginger,” but later thought better of the imagery. It was hard enough in the early 90s for locals to accept a deconstructionist’s vision for the otherwise Romanesque, Baroque, Gothic, and neo-Renaissance capital of Czechia without then slapping an American name on top of it. So “Fred and Ginger” was dropped, and in the end, most everyone seems to have accepted the Dancing House (even if it might look a little bit tipsy). A more formal acceptance of the building can be seen in the form of a gold coin, issued by the Czech National Bank in 2005, the final in a series called “Ten Centuries of Architecture.”  The building is in downtown Prague, at the corner of the Rasinovo embankment and Resslova Street, by the entrance to the Jirásek Bridge. It’s within walking distance of the Karlovo Namesti underground station. The building is used for offices and not open to public. But you can visit the lobby and the restaurant ""La Perle de Prague"" on the 7th floor, with a nice view of the Vltava River and Prague Castle panorama. The late afternoon and Happy Hour timeframe is the best time to enjoy the upper terrace views at the bar area - there is an outdoor rooftop patio for taking photographs.

87,Hlava Franze Kafky (Franz Kafka's Head),"Prague, Czechia","A bust of Franz Kafka spins in pieces, reflecting the writer's inner torment.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hlava-franze-kafky,"Franz Kafka, one of Prague’s most celebrated literary sons (albeit only after his death), was plagued by self-doubt and depression throughout his life. This mirrored, kinetic sculpture of the author seeks to reflect that by physicalizing the ever-turning pieces of the writer’s mind. His face is only there for a moment or two before disintegrating again once the layers begin to twist. Created by artist David Černý, the bust is composed of 42 different layers that rotate individually. Each layer is mechanized, using gears inspired by traditional Czech clockwork, like that of the famed astronomical clock. The patterns in which the layers twist are reprogrammable, meaning they can be entirely randomized, or completely orderly. The bust sits close to the insurance company in downtown Prague where Kafka worked his day job. Černý, who is known for his provocative installation work, was so pleased with the outcome of Hlava Franze Kafky (Franz Kafka’s Head), he made another in North Carolina. Rather than a famed author, he made the bust in the shape of his own head. He kept some reference to Kafka in the title though: “the Metalmorphosis.” Once you are in the area, there are quite a few interesting public art features in the area including Kafka who has some interesting working showing in the area: http://travelphotodiscovery.com/pragues-public-and-street-art-scene/",mechanical instruments automata installations literature sculptures statues art
88,Man Hanging Out,"Prague, Czechia",What looks like a suicide in progress is actually a statue of Sigmund Freud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/man-hanging-out,"Dangling above one of the cobblestone streets in Prague’s Old Town is a statue that has caused more than a few people to be concerned that a man is about to plummet to his death, but fear not, it is simply a fake Sigmund Freud. First created in 1996, the work known as “Zavěšený muž” (“Man Hanging Out”) is the vision of Czech sculptor David Černý, whose work can actually be found all across Prague. Many of Cerny’s works are seen as somewhat deliberately provocative, and this one is no different. The dangling Freud is surprisingly lifelike at a distance, and a number of people have sincerely taken it for a person in danger. However, it is simply a sculptural statement about intellectualism in the 20th century and Černý’s uncertainty about it. The piece, even if it was somewhat controversial, was still quite popular after its unveiling and was able to tour the world, being displayed in places ranging from London to Grand Rapids, Michigan. However, the piece is back in Prague, hanging extended over a tight, historic street, causing passersby to look away from the ancient surrounds and take a look up to ponder the future. With luck, Freud won’t be coming down anytime soon, and neither will 20th-century intellectualism.  Look up at the intersection of Husova and Skorepka",david cerny statues art

A civilian bunker lies buried five stories beneath Prague’s decrepit Parukarka hill, a product of the fear of nuclear armageddon that penetrated the masses during the Cold War. Though both sides of the Iron curtain became obsessed with preparing for the possibility of a nuclear war, such bunkers were constructed with more frequency in the Eastern Bloc, as communist economies fully focused their resources on defense and army structures. This bunker was not designed to house its inhabitants for decades, or even for years. Studies at the time found that there were many psychological risks associated with keeping people within the bunkers for extended periods of time, such as suicide and mass panic. So instead, the civilian bunker in Parukarka park was meant to save civilians from immediate death in face of nuclear explosions, and the idea was that they would evacuate to the countryside soon thereafter. Today, you can explore the remnants of Soviet era paranoia on a two-hour-long guided tour, which takes you through some of the communist spots in Prague’s Old Town and ends in the nuclear bunker. The museum within the bunker serves as a snapshot of Soviet life, and in addition to the requisite dozens of gas masks, contains books, newspapers and photographs from the time.   The nuclear bunker is only accessible through guided tours, which occur daily at 10:30 am and 2:30 pm.

The museum was founded by two noted anthropologists. Aleš Hrdlička, who famously developed the theory that humans colonized North America by crossing from Asia via the Bering Strait, a theory he supported with evidence from skeletal remains many of which are included in the museum. (He won the Thomas Henry Huxley Award in the 1920s for this discovery) The other was Jindřich Matiegka, Hrdlička’s co-explorer and chair of anthropology at the Charles University who, coincidentally, also organized the bones in the nearby Melnik Ossuary. Not all of Hrdlička’s theories were quite so well-supported, though. He was a critic of theories of hominid evolution and incorrectly argued that Central Europe was the cradle of human evolution. The collection shows all sorts of aspects of the human condition, evolution, disease, deformities, and similarly veined roads that tell the story of the human body. Artificial and natural mummification are both represented through artifacts, one of the more fascinating bodily experiences in this 100-year-old concept of Aleš Hrdlička’s to explore his anthropologic passions. The pieces in this exhibit come, in part, from Hrdlička’s world travels and excavations that took place mostly in the United States (primarily Alaska) with the majority of it collected between WWI and WWII. Along with the full Egyptian mummies, the museum houses eight mummified heads and 23 human skulls as well as several long bones.

From the end of World War II to the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Czechoslovakia was governed by the communist Soviet Union which influenced their lifestyle on the citizens of the country until the fall of the Iron Curtain. While the entire country would later be amicably dissolved, the memory of the communist era is still survived by for those that lived it. For those that were not present for those times, the Museum of Communism was opened in 2001 by an American political science major who set out to collect relics and everyday artifacts from the country’s communist past from junk stores, flea markets, and other sellers of forgotten things. His collection, now curated by a Czech documentarian, includes such items as a statue of Lenin, a replica classroom from the era complete with eerie student mannequins, and propaganda posters that display the socialist-realism imagery of the time.

92,Paternoster Lift,"Prague, Czechia",This doorless 20th-century elevator doesn't stop or slow down.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paternoster-lift-at-prague-city-hall,"An elevator with no door that doesn’t stop or slow down sounds like a sci-fi nightmare, but lifts like these were once common in many parts of Europe. The paternoster lifts are today a dying breed after safety norms banned their construction. These once-ingenious creations were invented in the 1860s by Peter Ellis, an architect from Liverpool, England. They were the world’s only “continuously moving” elevators. Popularly used in government buildings and stores in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe, they captured the imagination of many, including writers and filmmakers who featured the contraption in their work. Despite urban myths that spread about its functioning, the mechanism is quite simple. Users hop into the many open compartments of a paternoster, which travel in a loop, and hop off when it glides by their destination. Once a compartment has reached the bottom floor, it continues further, eventually rotating along an axis and starting to move in an upward direction. The opposite happens when the elevator has reached the top floor. Its movement resembles the way rosary beads are counted in a pious person’s hands, and this is where it is thought to get its name: Paternoster is Latin for “our father,” the first two words of the Lord’s Prayer. The production of paternoster lifts came to a halt in the 1970s due to safety concerns. There are currently 68 of these models in Czechia, about half of which are located in Prague. In spite of their potential harzards, people tend to view them with a sense of nostalgia, and as such, they have become the object of protection and restoration projects. The most accessible and arguably the best maintained paternoster lift in Prague is located at the back of Prague City Hall, which is in and of itself a splendid example of Art Nouveau architecture. This model consists of 12 compartments and was designed by John Prokopec in the early 20th century. Update September 2018: The lift is open again to the public. Similar ones can be found at Jungmannova 35/29 (Magistrát hlavního města Prahy).  A slightly weird and fun thing to do is to keep riding the lift while it reaches the bottom or top floor, where it shakes and rumbles, goes very dark, and moves sideways, which is an interesting experience!

94,The Deer Moat Pedestrian Tunnel,"Prague, Czechia",The tunnel's elegant proportions keep you snug with no claustrophobia freak-out.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pedestrian-tunnel-the-deer-moat,"Inside the walls of Prague Castle there are buildings dating as far back as the 9th century. Even the newer ones are from the Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance periods, and together, along with the formal gardens, they make up one of the largest castle complexes in the world. Along the north side there is a wild glen called Jelení příkop (the Deer Moat), originally part of the Castle’s fortification and later a private hunting ground for the king. The royal stock of stags (and even a few bears) is gone, and today the Deer Moat is a public park of inviting lawns and shaded woods, with a stream channeled down the middle. It’s all easily traversed via stone steps, paved paths, swinging timber walkways, and a 275-foot (84 m) pedestrian tunnel that runs underneath the famous Powder Bridge. The opening up of the Deer Moat and building of the tunnel were pet projects of former President Václav Havel, who wanted to give visitors an easier way to take advantage of the extended Castle grounds. He brought in Czech architect Josef Pleskot to design the tunnel, which incorporates the moat’s stream, much of which had been relegated to underground pipes in the late 19th century. Pleskot kept the stream, called the Brusnice, as part of the overall underground experience of the tunnel, an oval tube of elegant brick work that feels at once enveloping and expansive. The sloping curve of the walls was designed to create this sense of comforting roominess, to belie the tightness of the quarters–no doubt making some grateful claustrophobics in the process. Update as of October 2019: The Deer Moat is closed for the rest of the 2019 viewing season due to reconstruction. No opening date has been confirmed. Update as of October 2021: The Deer Moat is closed for the rest of 2021, due to technical reasons. No posted date for reopening was shown. Update as of February 2023: The Deer Moat has reopened.  The Deer Moat is on the north side of the Castle. The upper portion is more bucolic, with lawns for stretching out and paths for strolling. The lower portion is more rugged and wild, but with walkways and steps to get around without too much scrambling. You can enter the Deer Moat from Na opyši street, Klárov–Chotkova street, Královská zahrada (Royal Garden) from Letohrádek královny Anny (Queen Anne´s Summer Palace) downward along Fíkovna (Fig Garden).

They transformed the above-ground bit of abandoned bunker into one of the world’s most famous robots: R2-D2. The anonymous artists went beyond merely painting the old structure. They added two concrete pieces to either side of the concrete dome, allowing it to resemble the shape of the beloved droid. They also added fine details, like the restraining bolt featured in the movies. Surprisingly, the bunker’s Star Wars transformation went unnoticed for up to a week. The piece is not an official, city-sanctioned decoration, but it seems it will remain. The Mayor of Prague 2 Municipal District, Jana Černochová, has said that although illegal graffiti is not supported, the decor on the shaft is an improvement to the unsightly vent and no action will be taken by the authorities. Some feel it’s an appropriate addition, as Czech author Karel Čapek was the first person to introduce the world “robot” into popular culture.  The metro stations I.P.

Jakuba Vetsiho) in the heart of Prague’s Old Town is the home of a mummified arm and a rumored live burial. As you enter, take a look to your immediate right. Up by the ceiling, you’ll see a withered black arm dangling by a meat hook. Legend has it that a thief tried to steal the jewels off the statue of the Virgin Mary. When he touched them, the statue reached out, grabbed his arm and held him there until the parishioners (many of whom happened to belong to the nearby butchers’ guild) discovered him. They couldn’t free the thief from the statue’s grasp so they were forced to amputate. As soon as the limb was severed, the statue dropped the arm and immediately returned to her normal pose. The arm was hung from a meat hook in the narthex as a remembrance and a warning and has been there ever since. Also of note is the beautiful tomb of Count Jan Vratislav of Mitrovice. According to local lore he was buried alive in the 1700s. He wailed and moaned for 3 days but the parishioners thought it was his ghost haunting the church. When the tomb was opened several years later, his body was found outside of his coffin.  On Malá Štupartská between Masna and Jakubská",mummies memento mori sacred spaces

On the far side of the square are a pair of double doors which lead into one of the most curious, dark, and transportive museums in eastern Europe. The dark, immersive gallery of the Franz Kafka Museum exhibits the author’s personal artifacts next to eerie representations of his ideas. The museum plays between the lines of fact and fiction, reality and fantasy, to illustrate how Kafka was affected by Prague, and in turn how the city was shaped by his writing about it. The schools, apartments, offices, and streets Kafka frequented appeared in his stories as allegories for various kinds of suffering. Divided into two parts, “Existential Space” and “Imaginary Topography,” the museum draws a rope taut through the life of Kafka. Through a cornucopia of letters, journal entries, photographs, eerie soundscapes, and 3D installations, it weaves a tapestry of intellectual, artistic, experiential, and nightmarish displays. Various mechanical statues illustrate the writer’s strange, sometimes absurd ideas, such as David Černý’s pissing fountain in the museum courtyard. The exhibit mimics the surreal effects of Kafka’s writing, haunting the visitor long after the experience is over.",books literature collections museums and collections museums

Every inch of the wall has been filled with Lennon-inspired graffiti and Beatles song lyrics. It is a quiet, almost respectful space as visitors walk down the length of the beautifully painted wall. An image of John Lennon was first painted on the wall (opposite the French Embassy) after his murder in December 1980. Soon, it became a prime site for political and Beatles-inspired graffiti and a sounding board for disgruntled youth. Several attempts were made by the police to whitewash the wall, but in vain. Artists continued to paint on the wall, refusing to be pinned down. The wall is the property of the Knights of Malta, and after repeated attempts to keep the wall clean, they finally gave in and the wall now stands in all its graffitied glory. Visitors may even see someone working on the wall whilst you’re there. Often it is students keeping the tradition that began 40 years ago alive. Update as of October 2019: The wall has been covered by tarps and is undergoing renovations. The site plans to reopen as a gallery for professional artists.

Created by Prague-born artist David Černý, whose claim to fame was the painting a Soviet tank pink as a memorial to the Velvet Revolution, he’s also known for his unsettling large scale installation piece of babies crawling their way up the Prague television tower, among other works of modern surrealism.

Installed in 2004 in a quaint square outside Prague’s Franz Kafka Museum, the statue immediately made waves, so to speak. The figures are made of rippling, serrated bronze, looking as though they were crafted from stacked slices of metal, or like they were crudely 3D printed. This design choice works to integrate the swiveling crotch sections of the two men. Each of the figures is holding their bronze penis and peeing in a never-ending stream, swirling it around in a seemingly random, if surprisingly fluid (pun intended), pattern. But there is a method to their madness, as the figures are programmed to spell out Czech literary quotes with their pee streams, as though they were writing their name in the snow. And that’s not all. In fact anyone in the world can interrupt their constant quotes by sending their own message via text message to a number (+420 724 370 770) on a plaque near the statue.  The statues will interrupt their programmed movement and spell out the words sent to them. While it might be hard to look away from the swaying metal genitals, the basin the figures relieve themselves into is itself worth noting, as it is shaped like a map of Czechia.

Seemingly precariously perched atop two buildings, the Zeppelin almost looks as if it could slide into the sky at any moment. But the wood and steel airship isn’t actually an airship at all. Instead of lighter-than-air gas, this Zeppelin is filled with book-bearing people. It’s a gathering and reading space, a spot for people to hunker down with a book or discuss literature related to the DOX Museum’s mission to encourage critical thinking about social issues. The unusual reading space is wonderfully bright and airy. Sunlight streams in to create mesmerizing striped shadows that flicker across the floor. The museum also hosts various literary talks and events within the airship. The nearly 140-foot-long Zeppelin is in sharp contrast with the museum building’s sleek concrete and glass architecture. This mishmash of styles was exactly the museum director’s goal. He wanted to add a “parasitic” structure that would clash with the building’s modern, industrial style. According to the museum, the reading room’s surprising shape is rich with utopian symbolism. The wooden Zeppelin harks back to the late 19th early 20th centuries, when the early airships first took to the skies and inspired onlookers with idealistic visions for unprecedented future technological progress.",blimps aircraft architectural oddities museums architecture
102,Melník Chapel of Bones,"Melnik, Czechia","Underneath this small church are 15,000 bones, arranged by an obsessive academic.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/melnik-chapel-bones,"For the Bohemian queens and princess, it was a raw deal; for the other 15,000 skeletons in this crypt, it was an upgrade to nicer digs. The crypt under the St Peter and Paul’s church in Melník was intended to be a holy burial ground for Bohemia’s royal ladies, but in the 1520s a plague epidemic swept through the area, creating a huge demand for burial ground. The corpses which had been occupying the cemeteries surrounding the church were promptly dug up, and some 15,000 corpses were cleaned and dumped into the vault. It was basically just a pile of bones, and in the 1780s when ossuaries were declared a health risk, the vault was bricked up and forgotten about for some 230 years, until a Czech anthropologist, Jindrich Matiegka, decided to take a look for himself. Matiegka is considered one of the fathers of Czech anthropology, and spent a considerable amount of time studying skeletons, crypts, and ossuaries throughout the then Czechoslovakia. In the 1910s, Matiegka reopened the entrance to the crypt and began assembling the bones into his very own ossuary. Arranged with a “literate theology,” Matiegka stacked the bones into orderly piles and meaningful patterns. The largest pile can be seen directly in front of the entrance and is 15 feet square and over six feet high, and is believed to contain roughly 10,000 skeletons. Matiegka arranged the other 5,000 skeletons into a large cross of bones decorated with a palm frond, skulls into a heart shape representing love, and most notably built a tunnel of leg bones to represent Christ’s resurrection. Professor, anthropologist, and religious man, Matiegka definitely had a Gothic streak. As a kind of signature Matiegka wrote the Latin inscription “Ecce mors” (“Behold death”) spelled out in bones.

Some 50,000 skeletons were stuffed under the square into a medieval charnel. The bones were once piled in neat rows, but at some point water and mud had flooded the gigantic underground ossuary and jumbled the thousands of bones. The bones, thought to be from the 1600 and 1700s, are believed to have been dug up from an old cemetery to make space for more burials, as is the case with most of the ossuaries and catacombs in Europe. It is the sheer amount of skulls, bones and skeletons here, second only to the Catacombs in Paris, that make the Brno ossuary especially significant. It is clear that many of the people died of various diseases which can be seen in the coloration of the bones themselves. Though all the bones are tinted yellow — having never been exposed to sunlight — the extra-yellow ones likely indicate death from cholera, while the owners of the red-tinted bones probably died from the plague.

Believing it to be haunted, the congregation refused to set foot into the church, which slowly fell into decay. Until it was saved by ghosts. Consecrated in 1352, the church was victim to an unusual number of fires over its long years, and was partly rebuilt and fixed many times. The final spooky event took place in 1968 and caused the congregation to flee. During a funeral service, part of the roof fell down into the church. From then on the congregation, who always suspected as much, was convinced that the church was haunted and refused to enter. They held mass under the open sky rather than set foot inside the haunted building. While Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule this was not considered a problem, as the government was not a friend of religion anyhow. The years that followed have not been kind to the little church. On top of the increasing decay, everything that was possible to move was stolen, including paintings, religious items, statues, the clock in the tower, and even the bell. The rest became victim to vandalism. Not too long ago, some people decided that the church, a cultural monument of Czechia, was worth saving. Unfortunately, nobody could come up with the money to restore it. Then Jakub Hadrava, a sculpture student at the University of West Bohemia, had an idea: He sculpted ghosts to inhabit the abandoned church. He used fellow students as models, wrapping them in plastic and raincoats. Slowly but surely 30 ghosts came to “live” in the Kostel svatého Jiří, creating quite a spooky ambiance in the dilapidated place. Jakub Hadrava also wanted to create a monument for the difficult history of the area. Luková, once called Lukowa and part of the Austria-Hungarian empire, became part of Czechoslovakia after World War I. In 1938, the Nazis annexed this area to Germany and declared every German-speaking inhabitant German, which led to the expulsion of all German-speaking citizens from Czechoslovakia after the Second World War. Jakub Hadrava’s ghosts resemble the ghosts of the German-speaking people who once lived here and built this church. The plan worked. Word about the “Ghost Church” got around and it made it into the international press. Ever since, people have come to see the haunted church of Luková. Many visitors have left donations to save the church, making it possible to fix the roof and secure the sturdiness of the structure. The people of Luková have likewise embraced their haunted church. The congregation does not hold mass under the free sky anymore, but happily comes into the church, where they sit among their friendly ghosts.  The ghost church is not open for visitors, you can look in from the outside.

The year was 1580 and anti-semitic sentiments were once again threatening the nearby Jewish community. Rabbi Loew had received an answer to his prayer for help in the form of a dream, an answer that involved ancient rites to raise a protector from the lifeless mud, rites to create a golem. Legends tell of the creation of the Golem from mud and brought to life via a special inscription on the Golems forhead. According to the classic tale the golem - an animated anthropomorphic being - protected the Jews for a period of time before becoming too powerful and uncontrollable and killing gentiles at random. Removing the magic that had animated him, Rabbi Loew confined the golem’s form to the attic of his synagogue and had the room sealed for the safety of the community. Located in the ancient Jewish quarter of Josefov, Prague, is a synagogue built in 1270. Called the Old New Synagogue or Altneuschul, to reflect the belief that the building contains stones from the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, it is still being used as a house of prayer and is the oldest surviving synagogue in Europe. It has been the main synagogue of the Prague Jewish community for more than 700 years, with the faithful praying regularly except for a four year interruption from 1941 to 1945 due to the Nazi occupation. The Old New Synagogue is involved in other legendary tales aside from the golem. One has it that the building has survived for so long only because it was protected against fire in the ghetto by the wings of angels transformed into doves. Among the historical aspects of the building are a couple of architectural oddities associated with the story of the golem. Interior steps to the attic have been removed and at the back of the building a ladder to a sealed door is tantalizingly built into the wall. The attic remains sealed to this day and visitors to Prague continue to be entertained by the otherworldly story. Metro: Line A to Staromestská.",sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture

The 19.6-inch-wide path is really more of a staircase than a proper street, but that hasn’t stopped people from celebrating its svelte girth. Only one person at a time can squeeze through the thin passageway, which cuts between two houses in one of the city’s most historic neighborhoods. There’s absolutely no room for two pedestrians approaching from opposite ends to pass one another, which led to quite a few tight situations. To remedy this, someone installed a traffic light on either end of the street. With the push of a button, a walker can alert anyone waiting at the other end that they’re planning to pass through. However, be warned that busy tourists don’t always adhere to the light, so there’s a good chance you’ll wind up wedged within a traffic jam anyway. For those who are a bit claustrophobic, the tiny street is easily avoidable. It’s merely a little urban planning quirk, and is thankfully not the main way to get to the restaurant tucked away at the end.  The narrow street is located in Malá Strana, the city's oldest neighborhood. It's a roughly five-minute walk from the Malostranská metro station. The street is shown on some maps as “nejužší pražská ulička,” which means “the narrowest street in Prague.” One way to find it is going to U Lužického semináře Street and finding the house number 24. Vinárna Čertovka is next to it. Čertovka, a restaurant, awaits at the end of the narrow street. Diners there will find a robust menu and a back terrace with wonderful views over the river. To reach the restaurant without squeezing through the passageway, go northeast on U Lužického semináře toward Cihelná, then turn right once you see Proudy, the automated peeing sculpture.

It is believed to have been brought to Prague in the 1300s by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, who lived in Vyšehrad, the castle that houses the church. St. Valentine’s bone is now on permanent display and celebrated with a mass every February 14th. Determining legitimacy is especially hard when it comes to relics of St. Valentine. There were a number of Catholic saints known as Valentine, and many years passed between their deaths and the distribution of their bones to churches around the world. At least two of the saints Valentine lived in Italy in the late 3rd century, and another in North Africa around the same time. Over time, the stories of these different men seem to have merged, and today most of the mythology about Valentine centers around him being a patron of lovers. In 496, Pope Gelasius I made February 14—originally part of the Roman festival of Lupercalia—a feast day dedicated to St. Valentine. Today, there are no fewer than 10 places claiming to house relics of St. Valentine around the world, including the Basilica of Santa Maria in Rome, Roquemaure Church in France, and Whitefriar Street Church in Dublin.",saint valentine relics relics and reliquaries saints memento mori
112,Museum of Miniatures,"Prague, Czechia","Microscopic scenes; some call it novelty, some call it art.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-miniatures,"While some call it novelty, others see the tiny pieces, like a portrait of Chekhov on a cross-section of a poppy seed, as amazing works of art. No matter how one feels about the artistic value of micro-miniature artists, there’s no denying the intense level of skill, patience and devotion involved. The Museum of Miniatures in Prague features the tiny works of Anatolij Konenko. Born in Omsk, Siberia, Konenko is one of only a handful of professional micro-miniaturists around the world. His work ranges from “standards” like Matisse’s “The Dance” on a sliver of mammoth bone to more whimsical creations like a caravan of camels parading with ease through a needle’s eye. Konenko always takes an object we can identify - a seed, an insect, a needle, a hair - and breathes life into it. Certainly the objects are there to give a reference for scale, but they are also part of a dance. The micro-miniaturist allows himself to be inspired by the object, to play with the idea of the object, and change the way we view it. For example, one of the most spectacular pieces by Konenko is a flea, his feet clad with horseshoes, and his hands wielding a tiny pair of scissors, a key and a padlock. To create a 0.9mm pair of scissors, Konenko, like most micro-miniaturists, invented his own instruments, some of which have been used in eye-surgeries. As with other micro-miniaturists he could only work between his heartbeats, for fear of the slight tremor destroying his precious work.

113,Podobenství s Lebkou (Parable With Skull),"Prague, Czechia",An existential riddle in the world's largest ancient castle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/podobenstvi-s-lebkou-parable-with-skull,"Most tourists roaming the 750,000 square foot Prague Castle, which Guinness recognizes as the largest ancient castle in the world, are probably surprised to be confronted with an existential riddle in the form of a giant-skull bearing beggar on all fours. Jaroslav Róna, who also created the Franz Kafka statue nearby, is a rather prolific surrealist sculptor. In the 1980s he helped found the Czech art group Tvrdohlaví (The Stubborn). He built Podobenství s Lebkou, aka “Parable with Skull” in 1993, a bronze sculpture of a beggar weighed down by a large skull resides on a thick slab of aging wood. The sculpture used to be found at the eastern end of the Golden Lane by Prague Castle’s Daliborka Tower, where Dalibor of Kozojedy, known as the Robin Hood of Czechia, was said to have played the violin while waiting out his days. Parable with Skull is based on one of Kafka’s characters—the “beggar, who, with the death rattle already in his throat, insists on dying on the doorstep” from The Bucket Rider. The sculpture tends to intrigue and even confuse those who visit the castle without prior knowledge of Róna’s surrealist works. There’s also a surprise at the rear end of the statue: the beggar’s dangling bronze testicles are displayed quite prominently, often shocking admirers of the piece. Prague is a city known for its strange public sculptures, and Róna’s are among the strangest, but Parable with Skull isn’t a public work. To see the strange crawling man, one must pay admission to tour Prague Castle. Update: It is currently found at the Convent of St. Agnes (one of the National Gallery museums), in the part of the sculpture garden that wraps around the church portion, on the walkway towards the north convent garden.",world's largest castles ancient sculptures statues art
114,Spiral Tower of Krásno,"Krásno, Czechia",A spiral staircase twists to the top of this unusual Czech lookout tower.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spiral-tower-of-krasno,"The Spirálovitá Rozhledna (“Spiral Lookout”) in Krásno is one of the most unusual lookout towers in Czechia, a country with no shortage of lookout towers. Situated 777 meters above sea level, this twisty tower offers not just a beautiful view of the surrounding area but also some unique architecture. During the economic crises between 1933 and 1935 the village of Krásno wanted to provide work to its citizens and attract people to town by building an observation tower. Legends tell that the designers—local sculptor Willy Russ and the local architect Fritz Hoffmann—had been inspired by the story of the Tower of Babylon. A staircase with 120 steps leads up the tower, arranged spirally around the outside of the tower. The work was done by unemployed citizens of Krásno only. To save money the stone used for construction was collected in the near area. Up until the end of WWI, Krásno was called “Schönfeld” and was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With the expulsion of German-speaking people from Czechia after the war, the population diminished greatly and the view tower was not tended to. It slowly decayed, until 1997 when it was renovated and partly reconstructed. During the renovations porcelain plaques were added on top of the tower, explaining what can be seen. The tower offers great views in far areas around the year. Many events are organized around the tower by the people of Krásno during the year, among them a traditional burning of an effigy of witches. It is possible to visit the view tower year around though if there is a lot of snow it might be a little hard to get there.",towers architecture

Despite their adorable stature, yellow hue, and tiny broad bellies, the penguins’ appearance comes with a warning against the dangers of climate change and plastic consumption. Created by the Cracking Art Group, a Milan-based art movement, the yellow penguins are all made from recycled bottles. “The penguin is a social animal and has a strong ecological meaning: its survival is affected by global warming and ice melting,” says the group’s website. “Despite being loved by many, this animal is constantly endangered by human technological progress that brings wellness to man but damage to the planet.” The group’s choice to use plastic is not only for its aesthetic appeal and malleability, but also to show how the world is becoming increasingly artificial. By repurposing plastic, the group hopes to inspire new dialogues surrounding plastic waste and its impact on the environment. Other quirky sculptures are located just outside the nearby Museum Kampa (which houses modern European art), including David Černý’s arresting Babies sculptures. The eerie installation features three giant crawling babies san faces.  A walk through Kampa Park also offers views of Charles Bridge and the park is particularly popular during the summertime.

116,Velka Amerika,"Vysoký Újezd, Czechia",This former quarry is now a picturesque gorge that hides a sunken lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/velka-amerika,"Situated near the village of Mořina in Czechia, the Velka Amerika quarry site is a former center of industry that has left a stunning natural attraction in its wake that looks like it could be a setting in Middle Earth. Limestone mining in the area began in the early 20th century, with a number of mine sites popping up in relatively close proximity to one another. One of the biggest was Velka Amerika, otherwise known as the Big America Quarry. There was also a Small Amerika quarry in the region, which along with the other mining sites, are connected to Velka Ameika by long tunnels. As mining continued over the years, the gash in the land that was created got larger and larger until it ended up as a hole over 2,600 feet long and almost 60 feet deep. Once mining operations at the site ceased, water was allowed to flood back into the gorge, creating a still blue lake at the bottom. This new flood lake has become the true attraction at the quarry, offsetting the possibly upsetting fact that man created a giant scar in the Earth. Now the large mining crater is sometimes called the “Czech Grand Canyon,” and is a popular site for both hikers and photographers who are looking to get a perfect glimpse of the deep blue waters in its depths. There are hiking trails that follow the perimeter of the gorge allowing people to explore the circumference of the feature in about an hour, so long as they don’t get too caught up in the stunning scenery.

118,Žižkov Tower,"Prague, Czechia",Looming communist pillar with a Czech twist.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zizkov-tower,"The Žižkov television tower pierces over 700 feet into the air above the winding and charming streets of Prague. It is oddly phallic and looks something like a NASA project placed arbitrarily on the outskirts of Central Europe’s most treasured city. It was once considered one of the ugliest buildings in the world, and now holds the distinction of being one of the weirdest. It even made a daunting guest appearance in the movie Blade II. In 2000, rogue Czech sculptor and artist David Černý, who made his reputation protesting the late Soviet communism that controlled the Czech Republic until 1989, attached giant crawling babies onto the side of the tower. Indeed, Černý mounted gigantic metallic babies with bar codes instead of faces onto the tower high above the traditional cityscape. Whether the people of Prague considered the tower grotesque art, or a political statement in a country where democracy was still in its infancy, the babies stuck. After being removed in 2017 due to structural concern, replicas of the infants became a permanent feature of the space age tower due to popular demand in 2019. From the bottom of the tower, the babies seem tiny. However, in reality, they are well over six feet in height. Their faces are without features and instead fold into a type of bar code jutting out from their large smooth heads. Overall, ten babies were placed on all sides of the giant tubes that comprise the entire Žižkov Tower, and they scale toward the lower observatory decks of the structure. This style of baby sculpture had been a Černý staple for years prior to his addition to the Žižkov Tower. In fact, Černý had even debuted the babies in Chicago at an exhibition of Eastern European Art in 1995. Nonetheless, the tower stands as one of the artist’s most impressive and massive works of art in the city. Visitors to Prague should also check out some of Černý other works, including an upside-down horseman, which are present throughout much of the city. Truly one of the most spectacular sites in Prague, as well as the highest structure, the tower also provides incredible panoramic views of the city from its observation deck located over 300 feet off the ground. Currently the tower has gotten a sort of face-lift and has added a restaurant, and a luxury hotel apartment with an amazing view. The once barren platform area now hosts a mini-golf course. At night the tower is illuminated with different theme colors - usually the white, red, and blue national colors of the Czech Republic. For those who want a closer look or even to climb on top of one of the David Černý babies, a replica is on display outside of the Kampa Museum in Prague.

119,Český Ráj (Bohemian Paradise),"Turnov, Czechia",Bohemian paradise covered in majestic forests.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cesky-raj,"The word paradise often conjures images of a luscious beach, blue-green waves, and hammocks stretched between palm trees. However, the Czechs might offer a different opinion on the subject. Czechia is a landlocked country that has a moderate Central European climate and remnants of a communist past that is all too recent. Despite these impediments to the classical paradise, the Czech forests surrounding Turnov offer a specifically Czech version of utopia. Bohemian Paradise, or Český ráj in Czech, is a protected area in the north of the country, covered in majestic forests, hilltop castles and volcanic pillars. Only a day-trip away from the capital, Prague, it has become a popular tourist destination. Among the sites in the area, the Hrubá Skála rock town, is the most famous. Just seven kilometers from Turnov, the rock town is punctuated with volcanic sandstone pillars shooting through the tree line. The bright white of the pillars strikingly contrasts the deep greens of the surrounding woodland. The jewel of Hrubá Skála is the chateau of the same name, situated magnificently on one of the rocks. Although Hrubá Skála is the most notable of rock outcroppings in Bohemian Paradise, the rest of the protected area is dotted with similar volcanic pillars and a hike around the area is a breathtaking endeavor. There are many lookouts in the area, but finding the ones with the best views on your own may be time-consuming. Taking a tour with a local guide might be an interesting option. Along with the stunning forest landscape cut by the Bohemian Jizera River, Trosky Castle in the heart of Bohemian Paradise cannot be missed. Trosky Castle is comprised of two 14th-century ruins well over one hundred feet above the ground. The two ruins rise prominently from atop a hill and volcanic plugs, sending them high into the sky above the flatlands around the area. Originally built by a Czech nobleman, the castle has survived multiple wars and attacks and miraculously can still be visited by tourists. While roaming the landscape around the castle, visitors should also inspect the caves near the base of the castle’s hills. The castle lies only fifteen kilometers from Turnov and should be included in any itinerary through Český ráj.Another great place in the region are the extremely picturesque sandstone pinnacles of the Prachov Rocks (Prachovské skály). They are situated close to the quaint small town of Jičín. Visiting them requires paying a small entrance fee, but if landscapes and nature are your thing, then you would not want to miss them.

It also frequently hosts exhibits such as pieces from Museum of Decorative Art. Obecní dům (Municipal House) stands on the site of the former Royal Court Palace, the King’s residence between 1383 and 1485.  The palace was abandoned and then demolished in the 20th century. The current Art Nouveau building was built between 1905 and 1912. The mosaic over the entrance is called Homage to Prague made by Karel Špillar. Probably  the most impressive is the Mayor’s Hall decorated with Alphonse Mucha’s  painting. The paintings depict notable historical figures, such as Jan Hus (1369-1415), Czech priest, philosopher and early Christian reformer; the Hussite general Jan Žižka (1360-1424), follower of Jan Hus; and the Hussite King Jiří of Poděbrady (1420-1471).

It is a tribute to the many East Germans who travelled to the West German embassy in Prague to seek asylum in 1989. Those to whom it was granted had to leave their Trabbys behind as they fled to the west. This sculpture made its first appearance in 1991 in the city’s old town square. Today it is a permanent fixture in the garden of Prague’s Federal German Republic Embassy. Though access to the gardens may be available through the embassy, it can still be seen outside of office hours. Once outside the embassy, one can walk uphill and turn left when a park path presents itself on the side of the road.

122,Defenestration of Prague Window,"Prague, Czechia","The palace window through which Protestant nobles flung two Catholic regents, thus sparking the Thirty Years' War.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/defenestration-of-prague-window,"Deep within the vast Prague Castle complex is an easily overlooked feature that is quite literally a window to a devastating moment in history: the 1618 defenestration (the act of throwing someone out a window as a means of execution) that led to Europe’s Thirty Years’ War. The origins of the war lie in an entanglement of complexities that are often simplified as a conflict between Protestants and Catholics. When the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II attempted to make Catholicism the sole religion of the empire, the Protestants of Bohemia (modern Czechia) protested the suppression of their religion. In anger, Bohemian nobles in Prague flung two representatives of Ferdinand out of a window of the Royal Palace. The flingees survived their fall with only minor aches and pains, being cushioned by the flocculence of a manure pile, although Catholics claimed that a divine miracle saved them. Then, with significant chips on their shoulders, Ferdinand’s representatives reported their assault by the bunch of tossers, and the Thirty Years’ War began. As unique as defenestration of one’s enemies may sound, this was actually the second historically significant window-tossing event in the city. The first Defenestration of Prague occurred in 1419 when an angry mob threw a judge out of the second story window of the New Town Hall, starting a rather shady tradition. Yet a third defenestration may also have occurred in 1948 when Communists were accused of assassinating Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk by similar means. Although a reference to the Thirty Years’ War is unlikely to yield much reaction from most Americans, to central Europe it was a catastrophe of epic proportions, with consequences that reverberate through today. Fought between 1618 and 1648, estimates of fatalities range from 5 million to 11 million people, and it all began from a fit of jealousy in the Czech Office of the Old Royal Palace. If you happen to sashay into the Prague Castle and glaze over at its immensity, take time to visit the famous window for a moment of reflection.  The Czech Office is off the Vladislav Hall in the Old Royal Palace which can be reached via the courtyard to the right of St. Vitus’ Cathedral.

The victims of this tumultuous time are remembered by the Memorial to the Victims of Communism. This stunning monument was unveiled in 2002, over a decade after the fall of Communism in the country. To depict the suffering felt by the victims of the regime, seven bronze figures, all naked males, can be seen descending a long staircase, looks of despair on their pitted faces. While the first figure is whole, the second has a huge tear in his torso, and the third is missing an arm and part of his face. Each successive figure in the line is missing a bit more of its anatomy as though it was torn away, until the final figure which is little more than a jagged pair of feet. In case this representation is too symbolic for visitors to fully understand, a metal strip runs down the center of the staircase, detailing the number of victims being honored. The statistics listed are as follows: Despite the numbers, the subject of Communism is continually a controversial one and the statues have not been universally welcome with a couple of the figures having been damaged by an unclaimed bombing attempt. Regardless of the outrage on both sides, the Memorial to the Victims of Communism stands as a powerful reminder of the Czech Republic’s complicated history.

Before arriving at the main vault, the visitor must navigate some claustrophobic passageways, displaying stonework and the bodies of dignitaries. The corpse of one woman is frozen in a stricken pose, and a neat label informs the visitor that she was accidentally buried alive. Such errors were common during a time when paralysis and coma were little understood, and more than one such unfortunate in the crypt met this fate. However, it is primarily the resting place of the Capuchin monks, who placed their deceased brothers beneath the church over a period of 300 years. This practice was banned by hygiene laws towards the end of the 18th century. Mummification was never the intention. In keeping with their vow of poverty, the monks thriftily re-used a single coffin time and time again. After the funerary rites, they would move the deceased into the crypt, and lay him to rest on a pillow of bricks. The dry air currents and composition of the topsoil gradually preserved the bodies where they lay. The result is remarkable. Twenty-four monks lie perfectly preserved, arranged in rows across the floor. All are clad in robes and a number are draped with rosaries, or clutching a crucifix. A few lie peacefully, but others have fear or sorrow etched into their papery features.

High atop one of Dolní Morava’s famed peaks sits a looping structure that looks more like a space-age roller coaster than a scenic walkway. Offering panoramic views of the Morava river valley and the rest of the surrounding mountain range, the year-round adventure resort set out to add a little something extra to the experience of sticking one’s head in the clouds. Accessible by chairlift from the resort’s Marcelka chalet, visitors ascend to a total of 3,600 feet above sea level to the top of Mount Králický Sněžník, where Sky Walk awaits. Despite its daunting appearance and precarious location, the Sky Walk’s wooden tiers were specifically designed to be easy to climb; thanks to its stair-less construction, Sky Walk is equally accessible to those visitors on foot as folks pushing strollers or in wheelchairs. After taking in all the nature one can handle at the peak of its 180-foot viewpoint, the best parts of Sky Walk still await exploration. Really big, brave kids and adults alike have a couple daredevil options at their disposal. Rather than boasting one of those trendy glass-bottom platforms that seem prone to breaking, Sky Walk went with a mesh web strung inside its highest loop, where the bold can actually lay among the clouds and mountain air. For those who prefer the feeling of brisk movement over floating, designers included a 328-foot polished metal slide (technically a helter-skelter) through the heart of the beast. If hovering in mid-air or dropping a total of 18 stories isn’t your idea of a good time, fear not – taking the traditional route down Sky Walk’s smooth plane is a viable option… though if you’re honest with yourself, you’ll likely spend the rest of your life thinking about your missed connection with that slide. The full impact of Sky Walk ends up being akin to a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure nature experience, where visitors can dial back the thrill level to suit their individual preference.

128,Statue of St. Wilgefortis,"Prague, Czechia",A crucified and bearded female saint.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/statue-st-wilgefortis,"There are a number of treasuries and chapels within the famous pilgrimage site of Loreto Church in Prague, but there is one chapel in particular, The Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows, that houses a statue with a strange and fascinating—and completely wrong—tale. As a young noblewoman, Wilgefortis’ father (in some versions he is the king of Portugal) had promised her to a pagan king. The pious Wilgefortis would have nothing to do with the heathen king, so she took a vow of virginity and prayed for a miracle. It came in a rather roundabout way; the pagan king did not die a sudden death, nor did he fall in love with another girl. Instead, Wilgefortis grew a beard worthy of any 19th-century sideshow. The engagement was immediately off, and her father, so enraged by her unfeminine miracle, had her crucified. With that, she became an inspiration to oppressed and unhappily married women around the globe. Wilgefortis’ story may seem somewhat strange as far as the stories of the lives of saints go, and that’s because it is. Wilgefortis is a fake, a tale that dates back to a wooden carving from the 11th century. Her name is derived from the Old German words Heilige Vartez, or Holy Face. The Volto Santo of Lucca (”Holy Face of Lucca”) is a carving of the crucifix, believed to have been the work of Nicodemus, with one key difference. Instead of the customary loincloth, Jesus is clad in a full-length dress or tunic. He was commonly clothed this way in the early Middle Ages, but the practice had been discontinued in the 11th century in favor of the loincloth. Thus, when copies of the great Volto Santo of Lucca began to appear, the unfamiliar image of the dress confused Westerners, who quickly came up with the tragic story of Wilgefortis to explain the cross-dressing Jesus. It seems however that Wilgefortis was just the saint many women were waiting for. Wilgefortis became extremely popular in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, with different names all over Europe, translating to everything from “Strong Virgin” to “The Liberator.” There are a number of statues of the bearded and crucified Wilgefortis around Europe today, including the statue in the small Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows at the Loreta in Prague. She’s easy to miss—just look for a statue that looks exactly like Jesus in a robe.",pilgrimages saints churches statues

The Prague Pneumatic Post was one of the world’s most long-lived parcel delivery systems using the technology, running since its introduction in 1889 until flood waters damaged equipment in 2002. It is hoped that the system may yet get up and running again. At one time similar pneumatic post systems ran under Paris, Milan, Berlin, New York and London. Already in decline from a heyday in the 1970s, the Prague system suffered a serious blow in 2002 when flood waters put five of the system’s eleven main rooms completely under water and caused extensive damage.

130,Adršpach-Teplice Rocks,"Adršpach, Czechia",Enormous sandstone towers loom within a Czech forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adrspach-teplice-rocks,"Otherworldly rock formations fill this park, cropping up among the trees like giant stone guardians of the forest. The sandstone behemoths are massive. Yet despite their impressive size, they cast a rather small shadow on the Czech international tourism scene. Pass through the Gothic Gate, which looks like a portal to a mythical realm, and you’ll find yourself winding among the rocks, squeezing through crevices, and generally feeling small. Various trails weave around the formations, and climbers often test their skills on the sandstone towers. Keep an eye out for peregrine falcons, too, as this reserve is one of the species’ largest permanent breeding sites in Europe. Within these obscure and towering rock formations are such unique finds as a bust of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Why Goethe, who was German and not Czech after all? Goethe not only wrote “Faust,” which would be reason enough. He also visited these rocks in 1790, well before the reserve was on the tourism map.

131,Macocha Abyss,"Vilémovice, Czechia",The deepest sinkhole in Central Europe comes with a grisly tale and an unusual nickname: “The Stepmother Abyss.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/macocha-abyss,"Nowhere in Central Europe is the geological disfiguring of a Karst landscape better demonstrated than at the Macocha Gorge, sometimes referred to—with a satisfying sense of foreboding—as the Macocha Abyss. Sinkholes, subterranean rivers, huge underground domes filled with crystal clear lakes: these are all of the features of a karst landscape. Karst topography, some of the most dramatic terrain in the world,  forms when acidic water flows through soft rock such as limestone or gypsum. As the water eats away at the stone small fissures are formed. Deepening over time, these cracks become tunnels, tunnels become caves, and eventually the entire underlying bedrock turns into Swiss cheese. Such is the case with the Macocha Abyss. First explored by a monk in 1723, it is technically neither an abyss nor a gorge but a sinkhole created by the collapse of subterranean chamber. At 138 meters deep with a river flowing through it, it is just one piece of a vast underground system formed by the Punkva River slicing its way through the Moravian karst in eastern Czechia. The Macocha gorge is one of the few places where this underground river sees daylight. Walled in by greenery, the sinkhole is home to rare flowers and a three-kilometer-long (1.86-mile) walkway for viewing. While the gorge’s beauty is obvious, its nickname the Propast Macocha—literally “Stepmother Abyss”—comes with a grim tale. According to local legend (isn’t it always?) a widowed stepmother was living with her stepson. As time went on she remarried and had a son of her own. Not wanting competition between the boys, she asked her stepson to join her in collecting berries in the forest. The stepmother lured him to the edge of the gorge by telling him the best berries were there. Then, she pushed him into the abyss. The boy managed to survive, and his cries were heard by local woodcutters. Once the news got back to the village the townspeople gathered their pitchforks and torches, and promptly threw the wicked old stepmother into the crevice. In an alternate version, she threw herself in. Either way, the Stepmother Abyss was born.   Twenty five kilometers outside of Brno, the Gorge is only 30 minutes by car or train and an hour by bike. There is paid parking nearby. It is best visited in summer when everything is open. You can tour the abyss, by looking at it from viewing stations above or by taking a tour of the nearby by Punkva Caves which emerges at the base of the abyss. This is the best way to see it.

132,Jan Palach Memorial,"Prague, Czechia",Monument to a suicide protesting the Soviet invasion.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jan-palach-memorial,"A student who committed suicide by self-immolation in political protest, Jan Palach killed himself on January 16, 1969, after the Soviet Union invaded his native Czechoslovakia to crush the reforms of Alexander Dubcek’s government during the Prague Spring. Palach was the first to immolate himself in Wenceslas Square, where a memorial to his death now stands, but he wasn’t the last; Palach arguably, how he stated in a letter he left behind, was part of a suicide pact formed of students and others willing to sacrifice themselves in protest of the invasion. Most of the other students did not go through with their pact after Palach made statements on his death bed about the degree of pain that they faced; but Jan Zajíc, another student who according to some was a friend of Palach’s, did. The two students are memorialized with several monuments throughout the city, among which a modern sculpture by American artist John Hejduk on Jan Palach square near to the entrance to the philosophy faculty of Charles University, where Palach was a student and a bronze plaque with a copy of the student’s death mask on the same square. A bronze cross marks the spot where Palach set himself on fire, followed by Zajíc one month late. Zajíc committed suicide in the entrance of the building at No. 39 on Wenceslas square, where today a small plaque reminds of his act. In the middle of Wenceslas square there is another memorial plaque commemorating both students. Palach’s body was initially interred in Olšany Cemetery, but after his gravesite grew into a national shrine, the Czech secret police exhumed his remains. His cremated body was sent to his mother in Palach’s native town of Všetaty. The urn full of ashes was officially returned on October 25, 1990, to the initial site. Later, the square in front of the univerity he had attended was named after him, and the bronze cross was embedded at the spot on Wenceslas Square where he fell. There are also several other memorials to Palach in cities throughout Europe. In a letter that Palach left behind, he wrote: “Considering that our nations have found themselves on the brink of hopelessness and resignation, we decided to express our protest and awaken the consciousness of the nation. Our group consists of volunteers who are willing to set themselves on fire for our cause. I had the honor to draw number one and thus I gained the right to write the first letters and to enroll as the first torch. Our demands are: 1) immediate abolishment of censorship 2) ban on the spreading of “Zprávy” (Note: a Soviet newspaper, the title translates as “News”). As can be seen our demands are not unreasonable, rather on the contrary. If our demands are not met within five days, that is January 21st, 1969, and if the nation doesn’t rise with sufficient support (time-unlimited strike) of our demands other torches will be lit. Torch no. 1 P.S. I believe our nations will not require more light. January 1968 began from the top, January 1969 must begin from the bottom (if it is to begin).” About a month later the eighteen-year-old student of the Industrial Highschool of Railways Jan Zajíc followed him, setting himself on fire and dying immediately. He too, left behind a letter explaining the motives behind his act: “Mother, father, brother, little sister! When you read this letter, I will already be dead or close to death. I know what a severe blow my act will be to you, but don’t be angry at me. Unfortunately, we are not alone in this world. I am not doing this because I would be tired by life, on the contrary, because I cherish it too much. Hopefully my act will make life better. I know the price of life and I know it is the most precious thing. But I want a lot for you, for everyone, so I have to pay a lot. Do not lose your heart after my sacrifice, tell Jacek to study harder and Marta too. You must never accept injustice, be it in any form, my death will bind you. I am sorry that I will never see you or that, which I loved so much. Please forgive me that I fought with you so much. Do not let them make me a madman.

134,Houska Castle,"Blatce, Czechia",Folklore says this medieval fortress was plopped atop a portal to hell to trap the demons below.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/houska-castle,"In the second half of the 13th century, a mysterious Gothic castle was built. It wasn’t near any water, wasn’t strategically important, and didn’t seem to have anyone living in it. So why was this random fortress built? According to local legend, it was meant to trap demons. Supposedly, a gate to hell opened on the craggy Czech mountain. The castle was constructed around the portal, and a chapel was plopped directly atop the hole to keep evil monsters from spilling out of the underworld and slipping into the human realm. Folklore says the supposed gate to hell was so deep no one could see the bottom of it, and those who did attempt to enter the dark orifice encountered demonic human-animal hybrids. People claim cars won’t start near the castle and strange, bleeding beasts still roam the area after dark. In reality, the castle was built as an administrative center to oversee the management of royal estates. But it still has some real-life demons in its past. Nazis occupied the fortress during World War II, and multiple myths abound about their supposed occult involvements there. It’s possible to tour the mysterious castle and scope out any hauntings for yourself. You can view the old knight’s drawing room, the chapel that supposedly covers the gate to hell, and admire the old frescoes and murals adorning the building’s wall.  This is hard to get to with public transportation, as it is about 30 miles north of Prague, and the bus doesn't run too often. Best bet is to rent a car and drive through the countryside. There is parking (for 50 CZK) at the base of the castle, and then a little hike uphill through the grounds. Standard admission is 135 Czech crowns (as of June 2021) and is payable in cash only, although euros are also accepted.

135,The Heydrich Terror Memorial,"Prague, Czechia",Bullet holes in the church wall are a reminder of the violence that followed the assassination of a high-ranking Nazi officer.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memorial-to-the-heroes-of-the-heydrich-terror,"On May 27, 1942, Deputy Reich Protector Reinhard Heydrich—known as ‘the Butcher of Prague” and the right-hand man of Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler—was attacked by British-trained Czech paratroopers in Operation Anthropoid, and died of his injuries a week later. This was one of the only assassinations of a high-ranking Nazi official to have succeeded, and the consequences were swift and cruel. In the aftermath of the attack, 13,000 people were imprisoned and interrogated. Mistakenly believing the perpetrators were connected with the village of Lidice, the Nazis murdered over 5,000 people and also burned and leveled the entire town to the ground, even after realizing the connection had been a false lead. They even destroyed the village cemetery, dug up the dead, and changed the course of the river so that “nothing was to remain” of Lidice. After the assassination, the Czech paratroopers hid in the church’s crypt for three weeks until their hiding place was betrayed. Some 750 German soldiers surrounded the church, attempting to gas them out and then flooding the crypt with fire hoses through a tiny gap in the wall. Three paratroopers were killed in the fight; the other four took their own lives rather than surrender. The priest and bishop who sheltered the soldiers were later murdered by the Nazis. In 1945, the Czech traitor who betrayed their hiding place was arrested for treason and executed. In the crypt itself, now a small museum dubbed the National Memorial to the Heroes of the Heydrich Terror,  you can still see bullet holes and shrapnel scars on the walls. There are also signs of the paratroopers’ last desperate efforts to dig an escape tunnel to the sewer. Outside, the narrow gap in the wall of the crypt where the Germans inserted their fire hoses is still covered with bullet marks. The last words of the paratroopers were reportedly, “We will not surrender. Never. We are Czech.” The bullet holes and memorial on the outside of the church can be seen at any time. The small museum and crypt inside costs around 75kc to visit, and is open Tuesday to Sunday 9 a.m to 5 p.m (most Prague museums close on Mondays).",assassination nazis war history world war ii memorials military
136,Squat Milada,"Prague, Czechia",A former squatter's paradise outside Prague.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/squat-milada,"On the outskirts of Prague, a decaying mansion was home to an egalitarian project that could only come out of a socialist mindset: a cooperative art workspace and squat kingdom known as Squat Milada. Villa Milada was privately owned until 1988, when it was badly deteriorated and slated for demolition. Disputes between the original owner and the Czech government delayed this process though, and the house remained standing as skyscrapers were built around it. It didn’t stay deserted for long. By 1997 the villa had become known as Squat Milada because it was a popular haven for those seeking shelter. The 19th century mansion’s many floors and cavernous rooms offered comfort and respite to those who needed a place to spend the night. Because of the bureaucratic battle the house was trapped in, Squat Milada went unbothered by authority for years after all the other Prague squats had been evacuated or demolished. For this reason, too, it became the go-to spot for squatters around Prague. It wasn’t just a no-man’s land though. Squat Milada was a functional hive, buzzing with artistic and community activity. The squatters regularly hosted concerts, art workshops, and film screenings, some of which were attended by hundreds of people. The inhabitants shifted, as squatters are wont to do, but in 2008 it was reported that at least 15 people and 6 animals were living there full time.The house sits nestled between several universities, from which it siphoned water and electricity. Despite its illegality, it was regarded by its neighbors as a “social and cultural institution.” It wasn’t all rosy though. Squat Milada was often noisy and dirty, causing neighbors to complain. One police raid came away with two giant bags of marijuana. At one point, some of the dogs living in the villa escaped, broke in the Trojan Zoological Gardens, and killed several sheep. Police intervened to vacate the squat several times, leading to violent altercations with chainsaws, battering rams, and crowbars. The squatters fled to the roof, but were eventually arrested, in spite of protests from human rights advocates. In 2012, Squat Milada had been vacated for the last time and again stood empty and decaying. Prague authorities have made further destructive alterations to the house, like ripping out its roof and several walls, to keep more squatters from moving in. Along with a tall fence surrounding the property, serious local lore about Squat Milada has bloomed around Prague. It’s likely the house hasn’t seen the last of its concert-hosting, art-making days as a squatter’s paradise.",squat abandoned houses villas graffiti houses homes abandoned art
137,Prague Meridian,"Prague, Czechia",The slender brass strip in Prague's Old Town Square was used to tell time from 1652 to 1918.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prague-meridian,"Because there are many beautiful and fascinating fixtures in Prague’s Old Town Square (e.g. its famously macabre astronomical clock), it’s easy to walk over a historical feature laid right into the cobblestones of the popular meeting place without even realizing it. Before the technological revolutions that seemingly shrunk the world, Prague, like many other industrial cities, relied on its own local time. To determine high noon, the city used a shadow cast by a Marian column that fell directly upon the meridian of 14°25’17″ East each day. This occurred from 1652 to 1918, from when the meridian was set into the stones to when the Marian column was torn down by a mob in 1918 during a demonstration against the Habsburg Monarchy. Though the column has been gone for nearly a century, the meridian line is still visible. Keep an eye out for a thin brass strip flanked by plaques on either side, written in Latin and Czech. Loosely translated into English, they say, “Meridian, according to which time in Prague was determined.” They were placed alongside the time strip in the 1990s. Though the meridian is no longer a marker of high noon, it’s a subtle reminder of a time when the sun’s shadow was a vital tool in tracking the hours within a day.",sundials time clocks urban planning cities
138,Prague Metronome,"Prague, Czechia",Steadily reminding Czechia of its past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prague-metronome,"Czechia is a state still in its infancy. It has only been twenty years since the Velvet Revolution peacefully ended communism and split Slovakia from the Czechia. Despite the bloodless divide, the time under Soviet communism is still burned into the minds of many Czechs and Slovaks, and in Prague, a constant reminder ticks away every day over the Bohemian capitol. In 1991, Vratislav Novák designed and constructed a massive metronome on Letna Hill in Prague. Although the area is better known for its vibrant beer garden overlooking the river, Novák erected a permanent reminder in the area to memorialize the Czech struggles under communism. Cutting a wide path, the hand of the red metronome is over 75 feet long and is easily visible from the city and bridges below. While the metronome itself symbolizes the long struggle against Soviet control, the location of the metronome is a symbol as well. Prior to the metronome’s construction, the site atop Letna Hill was home to the largest statue of Stalin in the world. For seven years, a 17,000-ton statue of the Soviet strongman loomed over Prague, watching every move of the citizenry and quietly keeping control over the Soviet satellite. After his death, Nikita Khrushchev took control of the Soviet Union and distanced himself from Stalin. In a symbolic act of the changing of the guard, Khrushchev ordered the destruction of the statue by dynamite, blasting the former dictator off of his perch over Prague. The explosion of Stalin’s statue led to rejoicing in the streets, along with another 30 years of communism in Czechoslovakia. The metronome is a steady reminder of the legacy left by Stalin and communism in Prague. It is still flanked by two unlit torches, the only remnant of the statue that once existed there. Today, the area around the metronome is visited by tourists and used by many locals for skateboarding and picnics in the nearby park and beer garden. The area provides some of the best views of one of Europe’s most charming cities. The metronome can be reached via the Malostranska metro stop and the tram stop Chechuv Most.",outsider architecture ruins architectural oddities architecture

But since he stumped forward rather reluctantly and sometimes even stopped, I kicked him in the belly several times with my boots, to make him more lively. It worked and we came fast enough into the interior of a vast but as yet unfinished landscape.” In the statue, Kafka himself takes the place of the narrator, while a gigantic, empty suit takes the place of the unnamed acquaintance. It is surreal and strange, just how Kafka would have liked it. Installed by sculptor Jaroslav Róna in 2003, the statue sits in a small square on Dušní Street in Prague’s ancient Jewish Quarter, the neighborhood where Kafka lived, worked, and wrote. He even lived on this very street, at number 27. Róna’s statue was the first to ever honor Kafka in the city he called home, 80 years after his death.",literature statues

Between 1676—1783 over 200 bodies were laid to rest in the crypt chambers. The bodies were laid on a bed of hops inside oak coffins which were labelled with lead name plates. Because of the clever engineering of these catacombs, including a series of ventilation ducts and wells, the air circulated through all the passages and chambers and gradually the bodies were mummified and preserved, leaving their original clothing, shoes, and jewelry intact. Unfortunately in earlier years, reconstruction of the church resulted in an alteration of the crypt atmosphere and many of the bodies began to decay. In 1937, 140 bodies that were too badly damaged to remain on display were buried collectively in the city graveyard. The site in the graveyard is marked with a commemorative stone. Now, these remarkably well-preserved mummies can be viewed in a new setting in the rear of the church, displayed in glass coffins.

This unusually shaped radio tower and hotel dominates the skyline, and illuminated at night it is a sight to behold. Surrounded by darkness, it looks like a mysterious spaceship floating over the city and its inhabitants below. Completed in 1973, the hyperboloid tower was designed by Karel Hubáček, earning him the Perret award by the International Union of Architects. Pioneering construction techniques were required to ensure the tower could withstand extreme weather conditions and high winds. The structure soon became a symbol of Liberec, drawing visitors from all over the region as well as neighboring Germany and Poland, particularly during ski season. The building itself has a futuristic flair (or at least “the future” according to the ’60s) both inside and out. The tower was designed to naturally extend the silhouette of the mountain it tops, but isn’t merely decorative. It is a television transmitter, built to withstand the extreme climate. Built between 1966 and 1973, the Ještěd Tower was awarded the Perret Prize, an honor bestowed by the International Union of Architects. Below the tower is a hotel and restaurant, both of which embraced the “space age” motif with rounded egg chairs hanging from ceilings and gold-tinted lighting, everything decidedly round. The view is one of the most breathtaking in all of the Czech Republic, looking out over parts of Germany and Poland, and the majority of Bohemia. The mountain summit and tower can be reached by multiple hiking trails, car, or cable car from Liberec city. At the top, visitors can expect breathtaking views of the Lusatian Mountains of the Western Sudetes, and beyond. Those who wish to stay longer above the clouds can wine and dine at the tower restaurant or stay the night at the Ještěd Hotel.   The tower can be accessed by car, hiking routes, or cable car.

And of course the crisis of comparing your bone collection to the massive Sedlec Ossuary, that houses 40,000 human remains. But there is an advantage to being the black sheep of the Czech ossuaries. Křtiny Ossuary has character. The little town of Křtiny has only 800 inhabitants and it’s a bit off the beaten path from tourist-heavy Prague. But the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary and its basement ossuary make a trip worthwhile. The ossuary holds the remains of 1,000 people and is most notable for its mysterious painted skulls. Similar to the skulls at the Hallstatt Charnel House, the skulls were decorated with a black-dyed laurel wreath. Although not every skull was decorated as such, there are no other ossuaries in the Czech Republic with designed skulls and the practice was centered much further West in Europe. Some experts suggest that the practice made its way to Křtiny with a wealthy family wanting to carry on the Austrian tradition.

It’s a large display case holding various real samples of the elements in the chart. Each case is individually illuminated and connected to an interactive screen, which displays information about the elements and lights up the cases in different colors accordingly to their properties. The chemistry department resides in a Neo-Renaissance building built between 1903 and 1905. The architects were August Kožíšek and Bohumil Novotný. The construction was headed by Prof. Bohumil Brauner (1855 to 1935), who later became the first director of the Chemical Institute. He collaborated with D. I. Mendeleev (1834 to 1907) and contributed to the promotion and improvement of his periodic table of elements. As an assistant and then a professor of physical chemistry, Jaroslav Hejrovský (1890 to 1967) worked as a researcher and founder of polarography. In 1959, he received the Nobel Prize for the discovery and development of the analytical polarographic method.  The chemistry department is open during business hours. The software is in Czech only, but it should be easy enough to use it anyway. Once inside the building you can also have a look at the displays in the corridors, which contain various minerals, old scientific instruments, and other interesting artifacts.

Architects Vojtech Michalek, Stanislav Hubicka, and Svatopluk Kobr designed the bridge in the mid-’60s and construction was completed in February 1973. Its slanted columns rise up and taper where they meet the structure. Hubicka, who was only 30 years old when he started the project, based them on tree branches, an effort to soften the appearance of the gray behemoth. But the bridge is most well-known for the number of suicides it’s facilitated in its short history, earning its nickname, Suicide Bridge. No one has kept track of the count, but official statistics place the toll somewhere between 200 and 300 deaths. Beneath the bridge, in Folimanka Park, a controversial installation by Czech artist Krištof Kintera debuted in 2011.

147,Znojmo Catacombs,"Znojmo, Czechia",This network of conjoined cellars was riddled with traps and supposedly allowed the townspeople to pretend their homes were deserted.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/znojmo-catacombs,"Beneath the historic homes of Znojmo, Czechia is a system of defensive catacombs built by the townspeople to protect themselves from invaders, using almost cartoonish strategies. Calling the maze beneath Znojmo “catacombs” is a bit of a misnomer, as there are no bodies buried in the underground network, but with their crude, twisting layout, the description seems apt. The tunnels beneath the town were created in between the 14th and 15th centuries, as the citizens linked together their cellar spaces into one great warren. The passages received air from shafts leading to chimneys and fireplaces in the homes and businesses above. In addition, there were wells for water, as well as sewage and drainage systems to keep the space fresh. All of this was in service of creating a vast hiding place for the townspeople. Tunnels leading out of the city were also created in case escape was the order of the day. Should enemy invaders find their way into the almost 100,000 feet of tunneling, simple traps such as slippery slides, trapdoors, and narrow choke points, were also installed.

148,Museum of Historical Chamber Pots and Toilets,"Modřany, Czechia",Dedicated to the unsung history of human waste.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-historical-chamber-pots-and-toilets,"There is a small museum in Prague, not far from the Vltava River, that is truly a celebration of “form follows function.” In its collection of historical chamber pots and toilets there is a wide array of forms, all for one bodily function (or maybe two). The unusual collection features more than 2,000 pots, seats, thrones, loos, lavs—and just about anything else you can think of out of the water closet. That includes artifacts of some pretty famous people, which might not otherwise have such a scholarly place of exhibit. There is an Abe Lincoln (traced back to his actual White House bedroom), a Napoleon (made for the Emperor when he was in exile, although it got rejected at the last minute), and one belonging to a Chinese emperor from the Qing dynasty. There’s even one from the Titanic. It started in 2003 with a collection that, at the time, consisted of only two things: one stone privet and one dry toilet, both with some impressive provenance. They were saved from a trip to the scrap heap by the team that now runs the museum, when they were working to renovate the historic Třebotov fortress outside of Prague. The two pieces so interested them, they started hunting for more in antique shops, thrift stores, auctions and flea markets. Now you’ll find mini chamber pots for dolls, unusual urinals and bedpans, and other toilettes and pots de chambre traceable to important or historic events among the collection. Other pieces are simply average, everyday examples of how we’ve managed to get rid of our waste over the course of history. Many are beautiful and elegant in their simplicity, and others are ornate and flashy in design and materials. But they all share one thing: They carry with them a shitload of our most human past. Update March 2018: The museum appears to be closed as of February 28th, 2018.",bathrooms collections museums and collections museums

The ossuary, a small, unassuming building of a clay-brown hue, was first erected in 1741. Tucked in a cemetery behind the town’s medieval St. Lawrence Church, it contains the skeletons of what are believed to be the remains of fallen soldiers from the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48). Later, in 1829, a minister named Ondřej Zloch carefully laid out the collection of bones and skulls that you can still visit today. Look inside, and you’ll see a wooden cross surrounded by piles upon piles of human bones. According to folks in the nearby town of Pisek, the mystery of the ossuary is centered around a certain three-cornered army hat adorned with a feather. Legend has it that for a long time, this tricorn hat was placed on one of the skulls; however, whenever it was removed and placed elsewhere, the hat always reappeared back on the same head. According to local witnesses, this tricorn hat did indeed exist in the ossuary, and it can be seen in a photo dating to 1915. The Putim Ossuary was featured in a poem by Czech poety Antonín Klášterský, titled “In the Putim Ossuary.” In the poem, Klášterský contemplates the skulls of fallen French soldiers.

The city of Pilsen in Czechia is best known for being the birthplace of the now world famous “pilsner” variety of beer, but its industrial history is very nearly as important. As early as the 13th century the populace of Pilsen began creating cellars two and three stories deep beneath their homes, many of them connected by a series of tunnels. These were mostly used for food and supply storage initially, including a large amount of beer thanks to the Pilsen’s long history of brewing. But as the system of tunnels grew, they began to be used for waste, disposal and also water storage and transport. By the end of the tunnels’ construction, the city had over 12 miles of underground passage ways and one of the most advanced sewer systems in Czechia at the time. The tunnels eventually fell into disuse and became of more archeological interest as researchers were able to unearth artifacts from the middle ages buried in the refuse once used to fill dry wells. Today visitors are able to explore a good length of the tunnels, which in portions have been remade to resemble what they must have looked like during their heyday. Notably, there is a replica water wheel and an exhibit on medieval book binding.",beer subterranean tunnels subterranean sites
151,The Lidice Children,"Lidice, Czechia",The soulless eyes of 82 bronze children stare on forever in remembrance of a horrifying World War II massacre.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lidice-children-lidice-czechia,"The tiny Czech village of Lidice just northwest of Prague was barely on anyone’s radar until it became the victim of a terrifying reprisal for the assassination of a high ranking Nazi official that saw most of the populace killed or deported. Possibly the most tragic victims of this massacre were the children who are remembered today by The Memorial to the Children Victims of the War, otherwise known as “The Lidice Children,” a bronze huddle of 82 small figures with baleful looks in their eyes. In 1942 Reich Protector Reinhard Heydrich was attacked by a small strike team that threw a grenade at his car, causing him wounds that would quickly prove fatal. Nearby Lidice was targeted as having harbored the soldiers who killed Heydrich and the punishment was devised by Hitler and Himmler themselves. Every adult male from the village was rounded up and taken to a farm on the outskirts of the village where they were shot down ten at a time. The women and children were then separated and sent to separate concentration camps. The village itself was completely razed, with even the buried dead being destroyed. In the end 173 men were killed, 184 women were sent to camps, and 105 children were shipped off to another. A few of the small children were considered viable for “Germanisation” and they were sent to live with the families of SS officers. Unfortunately the remaining 82 were seen as nothing but a burden and they were sent to the Chełmno concentration camp where they were gassed. After the war ended Lidice had become a symbol of the Nazi atrocities and those that survived (153 women and 17 children) bravely rebuilt their demolished village. In memory of the events of World War II the memorial that stands today has 82 figures in honor of the 82 children that were sent to the gas chambers. The work took 20 years to complete and the original artist, Marie Uchytilová, died before it could be completed, however others stepped in to finish it. The result is a stark bronze work with the life-size children staring towards a future they would never live to see.",nazis world war ii military statues

153,The Indecent Little Man on the Church of St. James,"Brno, Czechia",A cheeky architectural easter egg.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/indecent-little-man-sculpture-on-church-of-st-james,"On the southern window of Brno’s Church of St. James, one sculptural element of the impressive church seems somewhat out of place: an indecent little two-headed man cheekily displaying his bare butt to the world. There are two legends attributed to the little man, both involving the competition between the Church of St. James and the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul on nearby Petrov Hill. The first is that the two churches, each financed by a family from either side of town, were about to be finished. The spires of the two churches both towered high, but St. James’ ended up being taller by roughly 30 feet. The naked man and his bottom were added on as a middle finger from the winning church to the losing one. The second story is that the financiers of the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul were jealous of their competitors because, though Petrov Hill was a wealthier part of town, the stonemason on the Church of St. James was one of Europe’s finest. In addition to his skill, he was an efficient and well-liked laborer, and as such work on St. James was going considerably faster than on the cathedral. Using power, influence, and money the lords of Petrov Hill were able to remove the stonemason from his position at St. James’, but not before he finished one final window. This, of course, was the one bearing the indecent little man, spreading his cheeks toward Petrov Hill for as long as the church stands. Some historians claim that both these stories are apocryphal, and that the rude sculpture is merely a strange but not uncommon piece of Gothic adornment.

154,Tivoli Gardens,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen's celebrated theme park and gardens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tivoli-gardens,"Tivoli, which opened in 1843, is the second-oldest amusement park in the world (after nearby Dyrehavsbakken, which opened in 1583). Consolation prize: Tivoli, with its merry-go-round and boat rides, resident symphony orchestra, and Chinese harlequin theater (which is designed like a peacock), is the most visited amusement park in Scandinavia. At night its gardens are made bright with colored lamps and hundreds of thousands of little lights. Located in the center of Copenhagen, Tivoli is an urban phenomenon and is surrounded by the town hall square, the Hans Christian Andersen house, and the main train station. It was founded by Georg Cartensen, who was given a five-year commission by King Christian VIII; Cartensen reportedly persuaded the king by telling him, “when the people are amused, they do not think about politics.” From the beginning, the park included restaurants, cafés, a theater, gardens and flower beds, a merry-go-round, and fanciful Oriental-style buildings. In 1964, the Beatles played at Tivoli. Michael Jackson offered to buy it. Walt Disney once described the park as “happy, with an unbuttoned air,” and he borrowed heavily from its whimsy for Disneyland. Disney even told his wife, “Now this is what an amusement place should be!” But Tivoli is more tranquil than the Disney parks, perhaps more tranquil than any other theme park, full of cozy gardens and fountains and scattered benches. Dæmonen (The Demon) roller coaster opened in 2004 and is one of the most expensive structures in the park. It is a floor-less coaster, which means that a rider’s legs dangle during the ride. Tivoli is probably the most famous landmark in Copenhagen - if not in all of Denmark. In 1944, the Nazis attempted to burn it down. But the Danes rebuilt and reopened the park within weeks. Other famous rides include The Star Flyer, The flying trunk, and Rutschebanen, which is the oldest roller coaster in Europe that is still in use.

Located just north of the bustling city center, Superkilen park is located in what is considered one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Copenhagen; an aspect of the city that the park was created to celebrate. The space itself if broken up into three different zones: The Red Square, The Black Market, and The Green Park. Each portion of the space lives up to the colors described in their names with The Red Square covering a wide public walkway in angular neon pink, orange, and red shapes; The Black Market consisting of black asphalt which is given texture by a series of tight white lines that curve and zag across the space, and which is centered on a glistening black octopus whose abstract form also acts as a children’s playground; and finally The Green Park is more of a traditional series of lawns formed into round shapes and blobs of nature. The main themes of each section is presented in a stark, high art motif, making it look like a psychedelic park of the future. In addition to the large-scale design themes, the sections of the park are filled with benches, lamps, and features that have been taken from over 50 different countries. Here there are some benches imported from Brazil and a streetlamp from Iraq, there a trash can from England and a neon sign advertising a Chinese salon. All together the park creates a sense of futuristic global culture coming together to mix and collide in one space. The Superkilen park was opened in 2012 to unsurprisingly international acclaim and continues to stand as a symbol of not just one Copenhagen neighborhood’s growing diversity, but the entire world’s growing interconnectedness.

156,Cisternerne,"Frederiksberg, Denmark",A 19th-century subterranean reservoir repurposed as a contemporary art cave.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cisternerne,"Some of the most avant-garde contemporary art in Copenhagen is quite literally underground. Cisternerne is an old subterranean reservoir that supplied drinking water to all of Copenhagen from the 1850s until the 1930s, and also doubled as a reflection pool for the nearby Frederiksberg Castle. When the cisterns were finally drained and covered in 1981, they were used as an exhibition space for modern glass art for a decade before they were adopted into the Frederiksberg Museum. Today, Cisternerne, which lies below the grounds of Søndermarken park, functions as a multimedia installation space. The only indication of its presence are the two towering glass pyramids that mark its entrance and exit points. When you descend into the dripstone cave (the only one of its kind in Denmark), the atmosphere changes drastically. The air is typically at 100 percent humidity, but the temperature is usually a cool 47˚F. Impressive stalactites and stalagmites extend from the floor and ceiling, but it’s the art people come to see in this unique setting. The Frederiksberg Museum commissions an artist to create an exhibition for Cisternerne every year. The artists use the unusual cavern setting—along with its darkness, humidity, and reverberant acoustics—to create equally unusual art. The dark, dank series of tunnels prove to be an excellent, if sometimes creepy, backdrop for light and video installations. Past installations include a mossy replica of a Japanese shrine by Hiroshi Sambuichi.  The entrance to Cisternerne is located in Søndermarken just across from Frederiksberg Palace and the Copenhagen Zoo. The entry is located in a pyramid of glass (see photo). As the cisterns are naturally very damp, waterproof shoes are highly recommended. Also be prepared for a temperature drop once down in the tunnels, and be aware of the presence of lye in the water.",subterranean underground subterranean sites caves ecosystems museums and collections art museums
157,Grundtvig’s Church,"Copenhagen, Denmark",This sublime architectural marvel is a rare example of an expressionist church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grundtvigs-church,"Located just outside Copenhagen, this monumental Gothic-style church is one of the most distinctive in the city. Indeed, it looks unlike any other church in the world. More than 6 million yellow bricks form a serene, minimalist look, juxtaposed with a soaring facade that evokes the shape of a church organ. Grundtvig’s Church was built to honor N.F.S. Grundtvig, a 19th-century Danish philosopher, historian, poet, and reformer. His influential ideas earned him a monument in his name, designed by master architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint shortly after World War I. The design is meant to be a synthesis of numerous building styles, merging the scale of Gothic vertical architecture with geometric expressionism and traditional Danish styles. Inspired by Grundtvig’s work, Jensen-Klint based the design primarily on the stepped gabled churches found in the local villages, but on a far grander scale. The massive church is 259 feet long with the nave soaring 72 feet high. The interior can hold about as many people as Copenhagen Cathedral. To balance the Gothic proportions of the interior, more than 6 million yellow bricks, a traditional Danish material, were uniformly used in keeping with classic Danish minimalism. The yellow color was chosen to represent ascension, literally and spiritually, and indeed, the church seems to be ever-reaching toward the Sun.",design churches sacred spaces architecture
158,The Little Mermaid,"Copenhagen, Denmark",The de facto symbol of Copenhagen is this bronze fairytale which cannot seem to keep its head for very long.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-little-mermaid-copenhagen-denmark,"Installed in 1913, The Little Mermaid basks leisurely atop its water-locked rock as the symbol of the city of Copenhagen. But notoriety has led to the figure’s head being removed a number of times in protest. Inspired by a ballet performance of the classic folktale, the piece was originally commissioned by the son of a local beer magnate and has now been gracing the waters off of Copenhagen for more than a century. The lounging figure stares wistfully into the distance, features forever frozen in a look of sadness, perhaps due to the constant threat of decapitation the mermaid has faced since her inception. As the piece became a popular tourist attraction, it soon became an unofficial mascot for the entire city. With this attention came a number of protests and random acts of vandalism to befall the statue. The mermaid’s head was first stolen in 1964 by political dissidents, and was never recovered. A new head was grafted onto the body, but then the statue’s arm was taken off in 1984. The arm was later recovered, but then another decapitation attempt in 1990 left a wide gash in the figure’s neck. In 1998 the head was once again stolen— but this time recovered— and finally, in 2003, the entire statue was blown off its rock with explosives. This little mermaid simply can’t seem to catch a break. Today the statue has been restored and still draws countless admirers each year. Yet it seems like only a matter of time before the mythical maid is imperiled once again.",mermaids politics statues
159,Elephant Gate,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Pre-Nazi swastikas adorn the sculpted pachyderms flanking this brewhouse portal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-gate,"No tour of the Carlsberg Brewery is complete without a visit to the famous Elephant Gate, with its four life-sized granite elephant statues that, uh…whoa, hey, wait a minute. Do those elephants have giant swastikas on their sides? They do indeed, but the symbol signified something else entirely when the gate was first built. Completed in 1901, the Elephant Gate was part of a building complex for the Ny (New) Carlsberg Brewhouse, started by Carl Jacobson to compete directly with his father who owned the original Carlsberg Brewery (thereafter renamed the Gamle — or Old — Carlsberg Brewery). When first launching this contentious new venture in 1882, Carl felt the need to adopt a symbol that would bring good luck and prosperity and chose the swastika, which since ancient times had been associated with good fortune (in fact, the word “swastika” comes from a Sanskrit word meaning “lucky or auspicious object”). Used in the official trademark for Ny Carlsberg, the swastika suddenly became quite inauspicious in the 1930s, and its use by the brewery was forever discontinued in 1940. The elephant statues, however, remain and include other symbolism beyond the now-stomach-churning good luck charms. Each elephant bears the initials of one of Carl’s four remaining children (four other children had died by the time the gate was built); thus, the swastikas were meant not only to bring good fortune to the brewery but also health and prosperity to each surviving child. Moreover, Carl saw elephants themselves as symbols of stability, vigor, and loyalty — an image which is perhaps somewhat undercut by going into business against your dad, but was generally pretty good for the brand long-term. Carl sponsored the elephants at the Copenhagen Zoo; the brewery stables occasionally housed elephants; and Carlsberg eventually launched a strong, rich, “Elephant Beer” in 1959. The Elephant Gate is the most famous Carlsberg landmark, and once served as one of two portals to the Ny Carlsberg complex. The tower above the gate once served as a water tower and herb silo, but now it stands vacant, as does the rest of the old facility; on-site beer production stopped entirely in 2008, and the landmarked buildings are now being redeveloped into a new residential neighborhood. Update: As of August 2019, the gate is currently obstructed by construction.  The gate is a stop on the brewery tour, which can be booked in advance.",breweries beer industrial sculptures
160,The Genetically Modified Little Mermaid,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Hans Christian Andersen for the postmodern world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-genetically-modified-little-mermaid-copenhagen-denmark,"Danish-Icelandic sculptor Edvard Eriksen’s “Little Mermaid” is one of Denmark’s most visited tourist attractions. The bronze statue, based on Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale of the same name, is as iconic to Copenhagen as the Statue of Liberty is to New York City. But it’s been a popular target for vandals over the years—she’s lost her head, twice. It’s an unfortunate state of affairs considering its origin: Brewer/philanthropist Carl Jacobsen commissioned the statue after being moved by a ballet production of the fairy tale. Bjørn Nørgaard’s Mermaid, on the other hand… In 2006, not quite 100 years after Eriksen’s iconic mermaid was introduced, Bjørn Nørgaard, a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, created “The Genetically Altered Paradise.” A news release described the piece as “a provocative and humorous look at postmodern society.” Located a quarter of a mile from the beloved tourist attraction are contorted, abstract sculptures of Adam, Eve, Mary Magdalene, Christ, a pregnant man, and “The Genetically Modified Little Mermaid.” This mermaid is also bronze and sits in a position similar to Eriksen’s, but her twisted figure, with elongated skeletal legs and an unrecognizable head, is a criticism of genetic alterations. The mermaid has avoided vandalism so far. Maybe it’s because, as Nørgaard says, she’s already “fighting against the order of nature”; any further modification would be superfluous. The statues, originally shown at the Danish pavilion at the Expo 2000 World’s Fair in Hanover, Germany, circle a sandstone arch topped with a 15-foot Madonna statue. They’re only a 10-minute walk from Erikson’s mermaid and, for those interested, offer a sobering alternative to his romanticism.

161,Forgotten Giants,"Ishøj, Denmark",Six beautiful wooden giants are hidden around Copenhagen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/forgotten-giants,"Hiding giants is a tall order, but Thomas Dambo has managed to hide six in the area around Copenhagen. Dambo is an artist who specializes in reclaimed and recycled materials, and the Forgotten Giants are no exception to this method, created from scrap wood collected from old, demolished buildings and felled trees. The sculptures were deliberately placed off the beaten track, and each is accompanied by a poem engraved on a nearby stone that gives hints about where it is hidden. There is also a “treasure map” of the area on which an “X” marks the spot where each giant can be found. Part of the point of the public artwork is to get people out and exploring, especially to beautiful places they don’t normally go. Dambo also hopes his scrap wood giants will encourage people to recycle. Each giant is named after one of the volunteers who helped build it, and every one has an extra function. Sleeping Louis, named after one of Dambo’s former assistants, references homeless people found sleeping in the area where Louis now lies. Louis provides shelter for the homeless; the giant structure can be entered through his gaping mouth. Another giant, Hill Top Trine, has hands that double as an overlook for visitors to climb into and enjoy the same view she does. Thomas On The Mountain (not named after Dambo himself, but an intern of the same name) has legs long enough for a lot of people to sit and relax, like the giant himself. Teddy Friendly, named after a friendly teacher, extends his arm to help people cross a nearby stream, while Oscar Under the Bridge helps hold up the bridge over Lille Vejlesø. Appropriately, scrap wood from an old water mill was used to make him. He was named after an artist from Chile. Finally, Little Tilde, who looks across a small lake, has 28 built-in birdhouses.  The coordinates are for Oscar Under the Bridge. The rest of the giants are in the surrounding area. A map showing the locations of the other five giants can be found on Thomas Dambo's website.",recycling giant public monsters forests hidden ecosystems art
162,Freetown Christiania,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Danish tourist destination well known for open stalls where vendors sell marijuana on the street.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/freetown-christiania,"Freetown Christiania, or simply Christiania, is a neighborhood of only 850 residents in the Danish capital of Copenhagen that is largely known both inside and outside of the country as a big headache. Authorities regard Christiania as a large commune, as it is regulated by a special 1989 law that transferred supervisory powers from the municipality to the state. Created as a squatted military zone in 1971, Christiania has always had a special relationship with the law. Almost immediately after it was founded, Christiania became known as a hub for cannabis trade, an act that was tolerated by authorities until 2004. This isn’t surprising, as after the military moved out of the area, homeless people took to the empty buildings which were guarded by only a small collection of watchmen. It wasn’t organized, but some claim that the takeover of the town by homeless men, women, and children was an act of protest against the Danish government in response to a lack of affordable housing in the city. Christiania has been a sort of hippie town ever since. Christinites, as they are known, have always been fond of meditation and yoga, only two examples of the many recreational outlets available here. The town also hosted an internationally renowned theatre troupe. Many Danes outside of the commune see the town as a successful social experiment, a place where entrepreneurs are as highly regarded and valued as the drug addicts who take refuge in the area because of the ongoing negotiations concerning the legality of substance abuse. The rules in Christiania, which has developed within the commune and outside of any interaction with the traditional Danish government, forbid violence, guns, knives, hard drugs, stealing, bulletproof vests, and bikers’ colors. While drugs such as cocaine and heroin are banned in the town, vendors sell marijuana from open stands that line Pusher Street, Christiania’s main strip. It is best to go during quieter times of the year, when the local residents are more relaxed and willing to chat to tourists. Further out from Pusher Street, you’ll find small art galleries and boutiques.",cultures and civilizations architectural oddities architecture

For those keen on the idea but not the long haul, there’s Verdenskortet (Map of the World) in Denmark. At the Verdenskortet attraction, visitors can march across all the world’s countries in a matter of minutes and then have a cup of coffee and a pastry at the adjoining cafe. Amazingly, the outdoor atlas was constructed entirely from soil and stone. Even more amazingly, it’s all the work of one man. Søren Poulsen was born in 1888 on the property and moved to the United States when he was a young man. After 20 years abroad, he moved back to the family farm on the banks of Lake Klejtrub. Following a failed orchard grove venture, he turned his attention in 1944 to the project that would consume him until his death at 81 years old in 1969. Always interested in geography, Poulsen decided to lay out the entire world through shaping a small peninsula on the lake. He did so with the use of a few simple tools (a wheelbarrow, a pushcart, handtools) and a whole lot of ingenuity - some of the stones he single-handedly hauled to the site weigh more than a ton. The finished map measures 45 by 90 meters, and is entirely to scale - each 27 centimeters corresponds to 111 real-world kilometers. It has become a popular family attraction in the Viborg area, as visitors take the opportunity to play minigolf along the shore and paddle rowboats in the miniature Pacific Ocean.

Opened in 2013, the Blue Planet replaced Denmark’s national aquarium, which itself opened in 1939. The old aquarium had the misfortune to open at the same time that World War II broke out so it was not a great time to be in the aquarium business, especially as they could no longer import fish. The hallways of the old aquarium also had awful ventilation, so that when it first opened people would pass out from the suffocating air. In 1944, a city strike caused the power to go out and staff used pedal power to pump oxygen into the tanks to keep the fish from an untimely demise. As the museum outgrew its space and became desperately in need of repairs, the original building was closed in 2012. The futuristic Blue Planet features 3,000 of the animals that were in the old aquarium, along with 17,000 additional watery fauna, including hammerhead sharks, sea lions, and Europe’s largest school of piranhas.

In reality, no mythical beasts were harmed in the making of the furniture piece, but instead the horns were narwhal tusks which were often passed off as the product of a magical horse in those days. Later kings would add gilded figures who perch on the arm and backrest of the throne adding an extra level of luxury to the seat, but much of its notoriety still stems from the seemingly magical building material. The throne was inspired by the biblical Throne of Solomon which was fabled to be guarded by 12 lions, and to reflect that aspect, the throne is always accompanied by three massive silver lions. The life-size sculptures are arrayed around the throne in resting positions and feature solid gold eyes, manes, and rumps. The Throne of Denmark was mainly used for coronation ceremonies before they were largely omitted from the country’s royal practices, and now the magical seat is simply a wondrous museum piece even though it still acts as the representative seat of the monarchy. Update as of August 2021: The white throne has temporarily moved to the sister castle Koldinghus in Kolding, 144 miles (232 kilometers) west of the Danish capital. There it will stay “for a year or so” before returning to its Copenhagen home at Rosenborg Castle, according to the museum staff.",thrones hoaxes wunderkammers hoaxes and pseudoscience magic mythology
167,Your Rainbow Panorama,"Aarhus, Denmark",This colorful artistic feature atop a Danish art gallery allows visitors to stroll through a rainbow.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/your-rainbow-panorama,"Ringing the ARoS Aarhus Art Museum in Denmark like a technicolor halo is artist Olafur Eliasson’s permanent work Your Rainbow Panorama, which allows guests to walk around and see the surrounding city through every color of the rainbow. From the orange-yellow ports to the purple houses next door, the city as viewed through the shaded glass walls of the circular walkway is transformed into a new form of monochrome every few feet. The light coming in through the glass paints visitors in an equally strong light making each person strolling through the 150-foot ring into a living crayon. Equally striking from the outside, Your Rainbow Panorama makes ARoS one of the easiest buildings in the city to find. From the ground people can watch as tiny figures of people walk around and around taking in colorful new views at every turn. Eliasson, the Danish-Icelandic artist of Your Rainbow Panorama, was reputedly inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy and finally reaching the perfection of Paradise. He created Your Rainbow Panorama to add to something that was already there (the view of Aarhus) and to make people think about where art ends and the museum begins.

Climb to the tip, and you’ll be rewarded with breathtaking views of Copenhagen. At the beginning of the 17th century, King Christian IV launched an effort to expand Copenhagen by building several fortifications and canals southward on the island of Amager. The newly occupied area needed a church, so construction on the Church of Our Savior began in 1695. The tower of the church, which was designed by Lambert Van Haven, did not have a spire. Decades later, Lauritz de Thurah designed a spire, drawing inspiration from the spiral shape of Rome’s Sant’Ivo alla Sapienza. It was inaugurated on August 28, 1752, by King Frederik V. The copper-clad wooden spire stands on an octagonal base and features semicircular arches and round windows with gilded frames. Four statues guard its base. The stairs—150 in total—twist counterclockwise, looping around the tower four times. A plinth holding a gilded globe and a sculpture of Jesus stands at the end.  You can arrive by subway at the Christianshavn station.",towers churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture

Most people find this gem by accident while walking across the bridge; many Danes don’t even know of its existence. The river tower itself has been around for 80 years, but the cafe found its home here just a few years ago. The tower operates as a place for the community to come together for cultural events and good food. Once you spot the tower with the big white flag, run over and grab a coffee while taking in the sights and sounds of Copenhagen. Walk up the lit staircase and you’ll come across two dining rooms before reaching the outdoor tables and chairs. Sitting on the deck is peaceful and the atmosphere inside is cozy and fun.

170,Møns Klint,"Borre, Denmark",A natural wonder in south Denmark.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mons-klint,"For a country famous for never being more than 52 kilometers from the ocean, Denmark does not lack in beaches. However, Møns Klint is a beach unlike any other. Upon arriving, one is greeted by a thick forest of twisting tree trunks and precarious hills. The forest can only be described as ancient; it is no wonder fossils were found here. Upon descending the steep and winding staircase, visitors are greeted with a humbling view of towering chalk-white cliffs contrasted by a teal sea. The large, bleached cliffs provide a unique backdrop for a day at the beach. Formed by shells of millions of microscopic creatures, the chalk cliffs were formed when glaciers began to move west. They then emerged when the ice melted away. Visitors also sometimes find fossils of shellfish mixed into the rocky beach. In addition to the unique geological setting, the chalky soil makes a variety of unique plants and marshes possible. Visitors can play on the rocks littered in the shallow surf or simply sit and listen to the ineffable sound of the waves hitting the rocky beach. Other activities include camping, hiking or cycling along the tops of the cliffs, kayaking, or visiting the visitor center for information about the fossils and rocks found at the site. Møns Klint remains untouched by time and a visit here evokes that boundless feeling. The easiest way when visiting without a rental car is the bus system. There's a train that will take you south from Copenhagen to Vordinborg St.; after that, it is just 2 bus rides to the beaches. The busses usually run every hour. Be mindful though, during the off-peak season, some busses run every 2 hours. If one does find himself stranded for 2 hours in one of Denmark's tiny country towns, it is definitely not a bad place to explore.",fossils natural wonders nature
171,Rundetårn,"Copenhagen, Denmark",The old observatory in Copenhagen has a spiral corridor used as a racetrack.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rundetarn,"Visiting famous landmarks in historical centers of European medieval cities often involves climbing various sorts of towers, be it a fortress, a castle or a cathedral. However, one of the most unusual of such places is situated in the heart of Copenhagen. The Rundetårn, literally the round tower, is noted for its lack of stairs. Instead this 34.8 m high tower has a smooth slanted spiral corridor. This 209m (964 foot) long spiral ramp winds itself 7.5 times round the hollow core of the tower. The tower was originally built as an astronomical observatory. The ingenious builders avoided the use of stairs in order to make the lugging and towing of heavy and fragile astronomical equipment to the top of the tower, possible. The tower was commissioned by King Christian IV and designed by architect Hans Steenwinckel the Younger. It remained in use as an observatory until mid 19th century when light pollution from the city and vibrations from the street traffic made accurate observations impossible. Today there is still an old telescope on the roof that is used by amateurs during the winter. However, the unusual internal structure of the tower gave rise to a quite peculiar activity, racing up and down the tower with various sorts of vehicles. In 1726, Emperor of Russia Peter the Great ascended the corridor on horseback. The first bicycle race in the tower was organized in 1888. In 1902, a Beaufort car was the first motorized vehicle to ascend this tower. The current bicycle record is 55.3 seconds and was set in 1993 by Ole Ritter in a race against Leif Mortensen. In 1989, Thomas Olsen went up and down the Rundetårn on a unicycle in 1 minute and 48.7 seconds. The upper part of the main facade is decorated by a gilded rebus, designed by King Christian IV himself. The rebus can be read as “Lead God, the right teaching and justice into the heart of the crowned King Christian IV, 1642.” The tower also contains a toilet used by the researchers and astronomers working in the tower and consisting of a seat almost at the top and a shaft leading down to the bottom floor built into the hollow core. This shaft has no way of emptying it nor any ventilation to the outside, making it arguably one of the world’s largest and earliest septic tanks.",observatories repositories of knowledge towers

The tale of Agnete and the Merman is a traditional Danish story that was originally passed down by oral tradition. As the story goes, a young woman named Agnete was passing by the sea when a remarkably forward and decisive merman emerged from the waters and offered her his hand in marriage. Being a spritely and impulsive girl herself, she dropped what she was doing and went to live with him beneath the waves. The couple had seven little mer-kids and things seemed to be going great until Agnete heard distant church bells ringing from land. She left her mer-family to pay a visit to her old life, promising to return. However once she was reacquainted with her old life Agnete decided not to return to the sea, leaving her merman to be a single dad, forever pining for his lost love. The underwater sculpture stting beneath the Højbro Bridge, at the bottom of the Frederiksholm canal depicts Agnete’s husband and her abandoned children reaching up towards the surface, longing for their mother in a haunting scene captured in eternal bronze. The eerie and incongruous site is easy to miss as one looks toward Christiansborg Palace and the Børsen, and dozens of tour boats pass by it every single day, but this subtle and imaginative piece of public art is definitely one of Copenhagen’s hidden gems.",fairytales underwater hidden sculptures
173,Kronborg Castle (Elsinore),"Helsingør, Denmark",Old Danish castle immortalized in Shakespeare's Hamlet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kronborg-castle-elsinore,"“In Denmark lies an old castle … and deep down in its cellar sits Holger the Dane. In his dreams he sees everything that is happening in all of Denmark.” – Hans Christian Anderson, from “Holger the Dane.” North of Copenhagen, overlooking the sea stands a great fortress whose massive fortifications contrast with its elegant copper roofed pinnacles. Kronborg Castle has been used as a royal residence, a garrison, a prison, and lastly a museum. But the castle’s fame chiefly rests on its connection with two great figures of legend. One is Hamlet, prince of Denmark, immortalized in the play of the same name by William Shakespeare. Although Shakespeare called the castle Elsinore, an Anglicized form of Helsingør, this name properly applies only to the town below the castle. But the world still knows it as Elsinore. The other Danish hero who brings visitors to Kronborg is Holger the Dane, one of the twelve knights, or Paladins, of Charlemagne. Holger is a sleeping hero who is said to sleep underground until the hour of his country’s greatest danger, when he will rise and fight to defend it. The castle can still evoke the Elsinore of Shakespeare.  Be sure to find the arrows to the right of the statue of Holger and follow the path all the way through the underground casements. They lead into complete darkness (use your cellphone light) in and out of the storage areas under the castle. It takes you back out near the entrance from the moat. There is a very large coastal map in the grass between the moat and the yellow buildings on the southwest side of the castle. It shows the coastline from Copenhagen to Helsingor and the coastline of Sweden across the sound from Helsingor. Once you find the metal plate showing Copenhagen you get the idea of what it is. Otherwise, it looks like concrete strips in a winding pattern on the grass.",shakespeare intriguing environs ecosystems architectural oddities architecture
174,Jens Olsen's World Clock,"Copenhagen, Denmark","The gilded, masterful astronomical clock will calculate time, dates, and planetary positions for thousands of years to come.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jens-olsens-world-clock,"As famous clocks go, Jens Olsen’s World Clock is a sight to behold. Sitting pretty in a tower at Copenhagen’s City Hall, this gilded horological masterwork is geared to calculate global times and dates, and planetary positions with remarkable precision. And, as long as it continues to be wound once every week, it will continue to display this information for the next 2,500 years. One of the most precise mechanical clocks in the world, Jens Olsen’s World Clock displays not just the local time, but also solar time, the exact time at locations around the globe, the relative positions of the stars and planets, sunrises and sunsets, the Gregorian calendar, the future dates of changing holidays, and more. The wheels were first put into motion back in 1897; then-locksmith Jens Olsen was 25 years old when he visited Strasbourg and saw the astronomical clock on display at the Notre-Dame Cathedral. The young man was fascinated by the creation and was inspired to learn the art of watchmaking, establishing himself as a master craftsman. He also began calculating and planning his magnum opus: a complete and comprehensive astronomical clock. He started the massive project in 1943, with the help of a team gathered during his career. Work on the different sections was underway when Olsen fell ill and passed away in 1945. The project was completed by a young clockmaker named Otto Mortensen, who worked in tandem with Gunnar Biilmann Petersen, the architect hired to design the clock’s exterior. After over a decade of calculations and careful calibration, the masterpiece, with 15,448 working parts, was finally completed. It was set in motion at exactly 3 p.m. on December 15, 1955, by King Frederik IX and Olsen’s youngest grandchild Birgit. Today, it sits in its own room where clock-lovers can marvel at its gleaming gears, the slowest of which is turning at the glacial pace of one revolution every 25,753 years. Update as of July 2022: The clock is open again.",astronomical clocks time clocks towers

But while Legoland may be Billund’s most famous attraction, there’s a new attraction in town. The Lego House is a structure that appears to be made of 21 oversize Lego bricks, housing a gallery of dioramas made from millions of colorful Legos. The Lego House, dubbed the “Home of the Brick,” is an enormous facility that is astounding on both the inside and out. When viewed from above, the 21 cuboids that make up the museum—colored in a palette of reds, greens, blues, and yellows—appear to represent an intricate stack of humongous Lego bricks, the top one featuring eight clear tubes to mimic the circular “studs” found atop a typical plastic brick. What’s more, it is possible to climb atop the roofs of these giant blocks, some offering playground structures multiple stories high. The interior of these 21 bricks is just as extraordinary. A wide variety of Lego dioramas are on display, including a giant waterfall, three T-Rexes, a lava-filled volcano, and a landscape with mountains and a castle. Perhaps the most impressive arrangement on site is the 55-foot “Tree of Creativity,” the product of 6.3 million Lego bricks and 24,350 hours of labor.",legos playgrounds toys design houses homes architectural oddities architecture

With over 22,000, he can now boast the largest beer collection in the world. Leif Sonne, an engineer from the small town of Svendborg, began collecting bottles of unopened beer as a simple hobby in 1968. Beginning with easily obtainable European varieties, he eventually expanded to include beers from all over the world.  By 1990,  the collection had grown to over 10,000 unique bottles, and had outgrown Sonne’s house. The collection was moved to the Carlsberg Brewery in Copenhagen in 1993 (fittingly, in fact, as a great deal of Sonne’s earliest acquisitions were made up of Carlsberg-affiliated brands), where it continued to expand under Mr. Sonne’s guidance.  By 2007, the collection had grown to more than 22,000 different bottles, and was certified by Guinness World Records to be the largest collection of bottled beer in the world.

But unlike more traditional fashion, the consequences of styling in the art world can be drastically more permanent. Hidden within Copenhagen’s Glyptotek art museum is a curious cabinet filled with 100 plaster noses. Visitors who find it stare in wonder as a single body part has been arranged so meticulously that it would appear to be its own work of art. In reality, they’ve come face to face with the Nasothek, a piece of commentary on the history of art preservation. Known for its large body of Greek and Roman works of sculpture, the Glyptotek has witnessed its pieces break over the years. The most vulnerable place often fell on the statues’ noses. Particularly in the 19th century, it had been a common practice among conservators to apply a facsimiles of the broken element, so as to re-complete what had been lost. Today this benign act of “restoration” reads like a grand faux pas. In the midst of an era of “de-restoration”, museum staff has taken to removing fake noses and appendages from sculptures to which they’d been affixed for decades. Hands literally full of noses that once graced some of history’s most prized countenances, curators were to decide what to do with the physical evidence of their ancestors’ art crimes. Rather than bury them, the Nasothek was born, which takes its name from the Latin for “nose” and Greek for “container.” In exchange, observant museum-goers have been given a rare glimpse into the face of authenticity in the art world, tucked into the corner of a museum teeming with perfectly imperfect creations.",noses collections statues museums

Built in 1787, it was the home of the Royal Academy of Surgery, where dissections were carried out in the central auditorium to train would-be surgeons. Today, that very space houses the Medical Museion’s historic collection of medical oddities. The Medical Museion covers the history of medicine from antiquity to today, with a large collection of historical instruments and anatomical abnormalities. This museum is not for the squeamish; the shelves are packed with human skulls, body parts, preserved internal organs, and the like. There is a remarkable collection of malformed fetuses that were used to train obstetricians and gynecologists in generations past, and one of human remains collected for medical education in the 19th and 20th centuries. Another exhibit details the connection between the mind and the gut. The museum was founded in 1907 for the 50th anniversary of the Danish Medical Association, and in 1918 was acquired by the University of Copenhagen, where it is part of the faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. Though small, the museum is full of historical and medical gems. It’s a fascinating (if macabre) look at how medicine has changed our lives through the centuries, and continues to today.

Dating between 400 and 1000, the burial ground was established by Nordic Vikings. The graveyard rests on the top of a hill overlooking what is now the city of Aalborg, but in the time of its creation was likely just a wide-open, scenic vista. Some of the 700 graves on the site are marked with simple stones, while others are demarcated by a pattern of boulders. Men would be buried beneath rocks formed into an ovular shape with pointy ends like the outline of a longboat, while women were buried under softer, rounder shapes. Large funeral pyres would be built above ground and burned to honor the deceased.

181,Wehrmacht Graffiti,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Bored potato-guarding Nazis etched their thoughts onto a brick storage building in Copenhagen's Meatpacking District.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wehrmacht-graffiti-copenhagen,"Food supplies are vital in any invasion. When the German Wehrmacht marched into Copenhagen in April 1940, they seized control of Kødbyen (the Meatpacking District), home to the city’s abattoirs and food processing facilities. The bulky, symmetrical building known as the “Twin House” at the Northernmost edge of Kødbyen housed the Nazi forces’ potatoes, a crucial source of carbs. Soldiers kept the stock of stored potatoes under a 24-hour surveillance. As they soon learned, guarding potatoes in a largely peaceful country wasn’t very exciting. They began to scratch words into the bricks of the Twin House so that now, decades later, people can read the thoughts that passed through their bored minds. Most of the messages are what you’d expect: names of loved ones and hometowns, drawings, and other tributes to home. But some allow us a closer look at how the soldiers tracked their time. “Weihnachten auf Posten 1943” (Christmas on guard duty, 1943) reads one glum brick. Another guard had scratched the date of his guard duty (August 1st, 1940) only to return almost exactly two years later to add the date August 4th, 1942 to his brick. Toward the end of the war, you can see the soldiers’ disillusion in solid brick form. One soldier scratched the words from Goebbels’ famous Sportpalast speech, “Wollt ihr den totalen Krieg?” (Do you want total war?) which had been followed by a roaring YES! at the Nazi rally. The guard on duty didn’t agree. On the brick wall, a small “nein” is scratched below the propaganda minister’s words—something that would have gotten a German soldier into a lot of trouble. Oddly enough, this piece of history doesn’t have protected status. New graffiti is added to the walls from time to time and as these age and darken, it becomes difficult to spot the difference between a half finished “Stuttgart” (probably abandoned because a commanding officer showed up) and a neo-Nazi swastika from last year.

His remains were uncovered in 1950 by villagers in the town of Tollund, Denmark, who were gathering peat for fuel. Initially his remarkable state of preservation led the villagers to believe they were viewing a recent murder victim and after much debate, the local police were called to investigate. Puzzled by the appearance of the remains, the police asked a scientist named P. V. Glob to come and view the discovery. Recognizing that this was an ancient burial, Glob began efforts to remove the body for further study. Like all the “bog people,” Tollund Man showed signs of a violent death. Nude but for a leather cap and wide belt around his waist, the body was discovered with a rope tightly wound around his neck. Later research was to reveal that this Iron Age man had been hanged in what is commonly thought now to be a ritual sacrifice. Knowledge on how to best preserve discoveries like Tollund Man was not yet known in 1950 and only the head of the original specimen was kept intact. The rest of the body was subjected to various tests to determine his probable age - 40 - and the conditions surrounding his life and death. Tollund Man’s body was reconstructed for the exhibit which now resides at the Silkeborg Museum in Denmark. The detail evident in his face is remarkable. Stubble on his chin, eyelashes, and the wrinkles in his skin are all exceptionally well preserved. The rope used to end his life still lies wrapped around his throat and visitors can peer into the almost peaceful visage of this victim of ancient violence.",bog bodies mummies memento mori museums

Trampling Boots! A Viking battle cry! These sounds fill the air of Trelleborg during the annual Viking fair of Denmark in July.  The weeklong Viking extravaganza features an authentic Viking market, displays of Viking lore and craftsmen churning out nostalgic Viking artifacts. The battle itself, fought between the modern-day army of King Harald Bluetooth and his son takes place near a millennia-old fortress that housed 500-700 Vikings during the reign of King Harald. The Trelleborg fortress is one of a series of barracks in Denmark built by King Harald for military maneuvering in the 10th century. The stronghold consisted of a circular rampart and two paths that cross in the center, creating four equal segments, each occupied by four Viking longhouses. The massive fortress, 180 meters in diameter with a wall 17 meters wide, is alleged to have used almost half the available oak timber in Zealand. Trelleborg has recently revived its Viking heritage, building a museum of Viking culture and a village that transports the visitor to the reign of a young Harald Bluetooth. Bluetooth, who according to legend acquired the name from his love of blueberries, was known for his conversion to Christianity as well as the unification of Denmark and Norway under one reign for a brief period. 21st century fame has come to Harald in the form of an eponymous wireless communication company whose logo bears the Nordic runes of the Viking king’s initials.

The caves are very, very old. When Denmark was becoming an increasingly Christian nation around the 11th century, limestone mining was a profitable industry because the stone was used in cathedrals. From this time up until the 19th century, the miners used practically the same technique of assembly line-style limestone ferrying. Machinery was introduced in the mid-1800s, individual mines merged together, and the tunnels were mined more extensively. Limestone remained profitable until the mid 20th century. The mines closed in 1953. The caves changed hands many times in the years following the quarry’s closing. At one point they were the property of Anker Buch, a concert violinist who staged performances in the acoustically accommodating caves, a practice which continues even now. In addition to cultural events in the caves, a museum dedicated to showcasing Denmark’s oldest industry also operates within the mines. Sixty kilometers (about 37 miles) of underground paths comprise the caves of Mønsted Kalkgruber, though only two kilometers of that are electrically lit. The tunnels vary wildly in size: Some are cathedral height, some are low enough that an adult can’t walk through upright. These tunnels open up into various cave “rooms,” some of which contain entire underground lakes. Visitors to the Mønsted Kalkgruber museum can wander through the caves on their own or take a train ride tour throughout. The train rides are only available between May and August, however, out of respect to the caves’ inhabitants: some 18,000 bats. In spring and summer the bats fly all over Jutland, eating insects to their hearts’ content. In the fall and winter months the bats retreat to the caves, when they need quiet for hibernation (hence no trains). During the beginning of the cold season, they tuck themselves into crevices in the caves, out of view from the museum visitors. In the latter half of the season though, the bats emerge from hibernation to test the climate. They fly about and hang from the ceilings as they wait for spring. The Mønsted Kalkgruber museum is intent on preserving the bat population, so much so that they feature a bat counter, noting each bat’s entry and exit from the caves.",bat caves bats underground mines caves ecosystems animals

186,Dyrehavsbakken,"Klampenborg, Denmark",The oldest amusement park in the world has been providing a nice spot to have some fun since the 1500s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dyrehavsbakken,"Everybody knows Tivoli Gardens, the famous Copenhagen amusement park that purportedly served as a model for Disneyland. But Dyrehavsbakken, or Bakken as it is generally known, located just north of the Danish capital, is the original and far more interesting park. Dyrehavsbakken (“The Animal Park’s Hill”) is the world’s oldest amusement park. It opened in 1583 and has since undergone a number of transformations. The location first became an attraction thanks to the freshwater spring located on the grounds. Bakken was a gathering place for those seeking clean water and beautiful scenery. Then, in 1669, King Frederick III closed the grounds to the public and began using them as the private royal hunting grounds. This remained the case until the park was re-opened in 1756 by King Frederick V. After the re-opening, performers, vendors, and rides began to make their way to the park, creating the Bakken we know today. The modern Bakken amusement park is wonderful, but beyond the park is where the real excitement lies. The old royal hunting grounds are still full of wild deer, beautiful trees, and some of the only hills in Denmark. For a real treat, go in the late fall when all the vendors are gone. The ever-trusting Danish leave the gates wide open and a visitor can wander through the abandoned amusement park (beware, the gray skies may heighten your fear of the giant clown signs) before trekking through the crisp fall forest, searching for bucks and abandoned wooden structures.

187,Grenen,"Skagen, Denmark",The northernmost point in Denmark is a turbulent sandbar created by two clashing seas.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grenen,"Known as “The Branch” in English, Grenen is a slowly lengthening strip of beach that marks the intersection of two seas which are continually forcing more sand to the surface. Skagen is the northernmost town in Denmark, and at the top of the town is the northernmost point in Denmark, Grenen. This is where Kattegat (the waters between Denmark and Sweden) and the Skagerrak Straight (part of the North Sea) meet. The clash of the two massive bodies of water make the area very treacherous to swim in due to powerful and unpredictable currents. However, it is one of the few places in the world where visitors can put one foot in one sea and one in the another. Due to the constant movement of the waters, the sandy strip of land is continually (if slowly) being extended as the tides push more sand to the surface. Given enough time, it is possible that the two bodies of water will no longer be connected but instead, Denmark and Sweden will have a new land bridge.  The 'Sandormen' tractor runs from the car park, near the kiosk to the northernmost point on the beach.",beaches natural wonders nature
188,Man Meets The Sea,"Esbjerg, Denmark",Four alabaster giants contemplate the tides on the shore of Denmark.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/man-meets-the-sea,"Unveiled in 1995, the quartet of sculptural titans known collectively as the art piece, Man Meets the Sea is a timeless tribute to man’s contemplative nature. The piece was designed by Svend Wiig Hansen, and is meant to have a universal appeal to represent all of man as opposed to any one ethnicity. The huge, 27 foot tall figures recall Roman colossus’ and Egyptian pharaoh sculptures in equal measure. The stark white statues are completely devoid of decoration, allowing visitors to map their own contemplative thoughts on to the figures, and their own countenances across the statues’ blankly staring faces. Although the figures may look alike, keen observers will find subtle differences among them. Man Meets the Sea is a favorite attraction in its town of Esbjerg and the statues can be approached freely. The pure white of the statues might also seem tempting to graffiti artists, but the work is so beloved that any potential troublemakers might want to contemplate their own actions before marking up Man Meets The Sea. Man meets the Sea is within walking distance of the Fisheries and Maritime Museum, which is also worth a visit.",public statues
189,Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse,"Løkken, Denmark",An abandoned lighthouse awaits its destiny: being buried under shifting sand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rubjerg-knude-lighthouse,"Desertification is not a problem that is usually associated with Denmark. Yet 60 meters above the sea, the Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse is slowly being claimed by shifting sands that have caused the structure to be abandoned for over 10 years, and will eventually cause its complete destruction. Wind from the North Sea blasts up the cliffs toward the lighthouse, and has steadily caused sands to move and bury the structure. Since its creation, the coast has eroded at a rate of five feet per year, rapidly changing the landscape around the lighthouse. The lighthouse stopped functioning in 1968, and stayed alive for a few more decades as a museum and coffee shop. But slowly, the force of the sand overtook the lighthouse, causing its abandonment in 2002. Efforts in the 1990s were taken to plant grass and other foliage to stop the spread of the sand, yet anything that was done was overpowered with ease by the sweeping dunes and erosion. When the lighthouse was first built in 1900, a few other small buildings were still nearby. The Mårup Church near the lighthouse, a residence built next to the structure and small gardens have all since been dismantled or destroyed by nature. The lighthouse is the last building to remain standing against the sand, but not for long, as it is expected to plummet into the sea by 2020. Update as of October 2019: The 720-ton lighthouse was moved 70 m inland. This is expected to extend its life until about 2060.",lighthouses abandoned ruins

However if you must, you might want to do it in the futuristic wooden confines of the Kastrup Sea Bath outside of Copenhagen. Part of the coastal Kastrup Strandpark in Copenhagen, the sea bath looks like something from the future of boardwalks. The award-winning feature was built in 2004-2005 by the White Architects firm, who put a modern spin on the classic wooden seaside attraction. The structure looks like a swirling ribbon falling into a semi-circular shape, with one end elevated above the other. To keep the thing from being destroyed by the harsh, salty sea winds, it was constructed out of a variety of African wood that is said to be harder than steel. Assumedly this would make slipping and falling, all the more painful. However once you are on the sea bath structure, you can see that even while it is decoratively lovely, it’s also packed with functionality. More than just a diving platform (although it has one of those), the sea bath features bathrooms, benches, and different levels of lounge area. The real main attraction though is the little patch of sea that is contained within the circle. while it is not cut off from the wider ocean, it cetainly seems less likely that a sea monster will attack you while you are swimming inside. At night, the whole thing lights up with classy accent lights that make it look even more science-fiction-y, even if it is made of wood. People seem hell bent on testing fate, and swimming out into the ocean, so lets hope they do it responsibly in the confines of the Sea Bath.",swimming pools parks water
191,Land of Legends,"Lejre, Denmark","This Denmark theme park is part family attraction, part experimental archaeology project.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/land-of-legends,"Located in the spacious Danish countryside is a theme park known as Land of Legends (Sagnlandet Lejre) that replaces roller coasters and cotton candy with authentic recreations of life during a number of brutal historical eras. From the Stone Age to the Iron Age, Land of Legends attempts to mix fun with the gritty realities of pre-industrial society. The park was actually established in 1964 as a site where archeologists and anthropologists could attempt to recreate ancient civilizations among the natural bogs, lakes, and woodland of the area. The researchers would reconstruct Iron Age farming equipment and housing, attempting to learn more about eras in the distant past by experiencing them. The actual benefit of the experiments were controversial, but people flocked to the site to watch the pioneering scientists work. Today, the site has embraced the public’s interest in its work and evolved into a park that invites visitors to come and experience life in the past for themselves, all while the experimental reconstruction continues. The major historical reconstructions at the site now include the original Iron Age village, a Stone Age camp, a Viking market, and a smattering of 19th century farm-cottages. Visitors can try their hand at some labor intensive farming, ancient handicraft, or simply watch the archeologists work. Stepping into the Land of Legends is almost like a form of time travel in immersing visitors so completely in the ancient eras. And even if that concept is too far-fetched, the park is still home to acres of experimental science.",amusement parks farms archaeology science

The highly acidic bogs have extremely low oxygen content and the combination allows for the remains of individuals to remain in a remarkable state of preservation for thousands of years. Various dating methods have shown that Grauballe Man lived in the Iron Age of Europe sometime around the 3rd century BCE. He is widely known for his distinctive ginger hair. Known collectively as “bog people,” bodies such as this one have been found by digging the peat used as fuel and building material for hundreds of years. Grauballe Man was discovered in 1952 and was the subject of what were then unprecedented efforts to preserve the body intact. A decision was made to subject the body to a further “tanning” process that allowed for continued preservation of the body after removal from the protective bog. Like other bodies recovered from the bogs, Grauballe Man shows signs of violence indicating that he was killed rather than dying of natural causes. In this case, the Iron Age man had his throat cut in what is theorized to have been a ritualistic sacrifice, bogs and marshes were considered by Iron Age cultures as portals to the world of the gods through which offerings could be left. The unclothed body today is noted for its striking red hair, a color that is the result of immersion in the bog and not the natural color of hair Grauballe Man had during his life. Today the body is on display at the Moesgaard Museum near Aarhus, where it can be viewed by visitors.",bog bodies mummies memento mori museums
194,Velling Koller Fairy Tale Gardens,"Bryrup, Denmark",The decaying remains of a 1960s mechanical wonderland that never officially closed.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/velling-koller-fairy-tale-gardens,"There’s an intrinsic corpse-like sadness hanging over what remains of the Velling Koller Fairy Tale Gardens near Bryrup, Denmark. What was once a vibrant fairy tale theme park is now a ghost of its former glory, set within a lawn surrounded by a few pigs, ducks, a pony, and some playground equipment. In 1956 Holger Rohde, a conservator-restorer by trade, was inspired by Disneyland to set about building a fairy tale theme park to attract visitors. The Fairy Tale Gardens opened in 1962 and was an immediate success. In the mid-1960s, it was only surpassed in visitor numbers by Copenhagen’s Tivoli Gardens. Rohde populated the place with rides and mechanical tableaus telling the recorded tales of Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm. For good measure, he also threw in some of Space Age excitement in the form of aliens, robots, rockets, and the story of Yuri Gagarin. The Danish cowpunk (country punk)/comedy band DAD shot the music video for their signature song, “It’s After Dark” on the grounds, showcasing its creepy, shiny mannequins and oddly proportioned interpretations of Disney characters. The Fairy Tale Gardens never officially closed, though after its heyday in the ‘60s it fell into disrepair. The grounds remained open as the garden slowly fell apart. The wooden birch men rotted away, more and more recorded fairy tales fell silent, and swan boats were turned into planters. Rohde sold the place and retired in the late 1980s. Only two breeze-block castle structures and one of the open wooden sheds that housed a fairy tale tableau remain. One of the castles served as a rabbit hutch for a while, but this now stands empty. The other is connected to the main building and is home to a damp and depressing ball pit decorated with an abandoned attempt at a mural of a Hans Christian Andersen scene. Update July 2018: The site has been converted to a camping site. The main gate and rabbit castle still remain, but are now integrated in to the camping’s offices. The playground has been updated and restored and the place is often brimming with campers. Be careful if you use the playground, some of the homemade equipment features sharp metal edges that may leave impressive souvenir scars. The surrounding woods are worth a hike, with a beautiful view at Vellingkalv and the remains of a robbers den to the east.",disney abandoned amusement parks fairytales theme parks gardens abandoned plants

Consisting of a wood-paneled deck raised on steel legs, the simple form of the Infinite Bridge seamlessly connects the land with the sea as it stretches out into the Bay of Aarhus. The bridge forms a perfect circle overlapping the sand and sea. The height of the bridge decking above the water varies with the tide. The bridge spans 200 feet (60 meters) in diameter and provides a panoramic view across the bay and along the forest-lined stretch of beach. The Infinite Bridge was designed by Danish architects Niels Povlsgaard and Johan Gjødes. It was constructed in 2015 for the biennial Sculpture by the Sea event. The bridge is located on the site of a former historic pier. The bridge was one of 56 sculptures in the Aarhus area and was originally designed as a temporary display. However, the bridge was so popular, particularly with locals, that the bridge became a permanent piece of functional interactive artwork.  The Infinite Bridge is set up between May (week 19) until October (week 42). There is roadside parking beyond the bridge beside the Marselisborg Deer Park.",bridges outsider art art architecture

Yes, they will take you for a boat ride. In fact, they’ll even let you steer. The ships at the Viking Ship Museum in the Danish city of Roskilde may be above the waves now, but until 1962, they were decaying at the bottom of the icy depths in Skuldelev. Known now as the Skuldelev ships, these ancient vessels were five in  total: two cargo ships, a long-cargo/fishing ship, and two warships. Products of the 11th century, the ships were determined to be the remains of ships that were sunk deliberately to act as an underwater shield, defending Skuldelev from attacks by sea. The museum (along with the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo) is a nautical enthusiast’s paradise. The five hulking restorations are the main attraction, but the museum is rich with seafaring artifacts and displays, and there is a strong representation of the art of boatbuilding, including an option to buy your very own handmade wooden boat to take home. Due to the heavy focus on building, this particular viking museum is known for having the most skilled crew out there, when it comes to reconstruction. One of the more exciting offerings in vikingland is the museum’s full-day “Learn to Sail a Viking Ship” course. Focusing on practical sailing practices, participants learn the basics for sailing a square sail, a very different experience from today’s modern sails, a challenge for both experienced and novice sailors. Along with an opportunity to learn the ropes, the museum also offers a children’s museum, a restaurant and cafe, and interactive displays of the three inside boats, the ones not currently afloat on the harbor.",ship graveyards vikings ships museums and collections

King Gorm and his son, Harald Bluetooth (whose name and runic symbol were later given to Bluetooth technology) left behind massive pagan mounds, rune stones, and a Christian church to commemorate the paradigm shift that occurred between their reigns. The first stone was erected by King Gorm the Old following the death of his wife, Queen Thyra, sometime around the mid-10th century. It reads, “King Gormr made this monument in memory of Thyrvé, his wife, Denmark’s adornment.” This is the oldest known writing referencing Denmark as a cohesive nation, and because of this the stone is sometimes called “Denmark’s birth certificate.” The second, larger stone was erected by King Harald Bluetooth and reads, “King Haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of Gormr, his father, and in memory of Thyrvé, his mother; that Haraldr who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian.“ This stone, erected some time after the first, is significantly more Christian in fashion. It marks a point of transition between paganism and Christianity in Denmark. This is driven home by the intricate Viking-style carving of Christ on the cross on the converse side of the stone. Just beyond the stones are two massive mounds, constructed with architectural precision equal to the Egyptian pyramids. These are a traditional Scandinavian pagan burial, and the first is believed to be King Gorm’s original tomb. The purpose of the second mound remains a mystery. The scant remains of a massive Viking ship have been unearthed between the mounds. Towards the end of his reign, Harald had Denmark’s first stone church erected at Jelling to solidify his Christianization of the nation. The church has been strikingly well-preserved, with frescoes from the 1100s still vivid and intact. These are family heirlooms of sorts belonging to the Danish royal family, all of whom have descended from Gorm and Thyra’s line, but the stones, the mounds, and the church are significant to all Danes. They represent the origins of their national identity, and they carry it with them when they travel out into the world—an image of the Christ carving appears on all Danish passports.",mounds paganism vikings unesco christianity royalty burial places cemeteries churches sacred spaces
199,Voergaard Castle,"Dronninglund, Denmark",This Danish castle is supposedly haunted by a woman too independent to not be a witch.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/voergaard-castle-2,"Too beautiful to be duplicated, it is said that the harsh lady of this Renaissance castle had the architect thrown into the moat and left to drown, so that he could never build another one like it. As notable for its art collection as for its ghost stories, Voergaard Castle is located in Drottninglund, in northeastern Denmark. It houses works by Goya, Rubens, and Raphael, as well as furniture belongining to both Louis XIV and Louis XVI. With its oldest part dating back to 1480, this castle with its wide moat and meter-thick walls has had many years to accrue both art pieces and pieces of legend. Besides an infamous dungeon without light, ventilation, or room for a grown man to sit or stand, many of the darker stories surrounding Voergaard Castle have to do with a merciless noblewoman named Ingeborg Skeel. In addition to offing the poor architect, Ingeborg is charged with continual cruelty, all-consuming greed, and thoroughly haunting the grounds – so thoroughly that a priest was called in after her death to perform an exorcism. History, however, presents a more complicated picture. There was indeed a woman named Ingeborg Skeel, who acquired the estate in 1578, when it also received status as a local judicial unit. The highly-enterprising Ingeborg managed the estate herself, which was unusual for her time, and aroused the suspicion of the populace. In addition to accusations of various evil deeds, it was rumored that she was a witch, in a pact with the devil, and any number of other unsavory charges. Ingeborg can’t have been all bad, though – she was certainly a talented businesswoman, and gave back to the community in a number of ways, donating money to the local poor house and erecting both a hospital and school for the people living in nearby Sæby. So, if the reports of a ghostly lady making her way around the castle at night are true, she may not be out to steal souls. She may just want to be sure the finances are still in order.

200,Frederiksborg Castle,"Hillerød, Denmark",This striking royal residence is the largest Renaissance-style castle in Scandinavia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/frederiksborg-castle,"Just north of Copenhagen lies an imposing royal palace complex dating to the early 17th century, built for King Christian IV who ruled over Denmark and Norway at the time. The monarch first demolished his father’s manor house, where he was born, and then built this palatial Dutch Renaissance-style castle on the site. Dubbed Frederiksborg Castle, it remains the largest Renaissance castle in the Nordic region. In 1859, a major fire destroyed much of the castle, and a national collection and lottery were held to rebuild the structure. Remarkably, the chapel came out of the fire almost intact and is therefore still in its original state. When the restored castle reopened in 1878 it became home to the Museum of National History, which showcases art and artifacts from Danish history within the palace walls. The museum’s portrait collection, the largest in the country, is like taking a stroll through time. Visitors can also explore many restored staterooms inside the castle, including the Great Hall, a grand ballroom above the chapel. These beautiful spaces offer a glimpse of royal life in Denmark centuries ago. Outside, the castle complex is an architectural gem in a stunning setting, spread across three small islands around the Slotssøen, or “Castle Lake.” While the castle was being built, King Christian IV stayed in an Italian-style “pleasure palace” on the other side of the lake, and when it was demolished in 1720 it was replaced by the beautiful baroque gardens seen today. A visit to the castle would not be complete without a stroll through the impeccably landscaped English gardens. They are full of beautiful flowers and perfectly trimmed hedges, and offer picture-perfect views of the castle and lake.  The castle is an easy trip from Copenhagen. It's about a 40-minute drive and there are a number of public car parks within walking distance of the castle. There are regular trains from Copenhagen Central to Hillerod and transport is free with a Copenhagen Card—look for the S-trains and line E, disembark at Hillerod station.

However, thanks to an old saying, the street is known by many Danes. The street is mentioned in the phrase “Fanden er løs i Laksegade” (“The devil is loose on Salmon Street”). The story behind this curious sentence dates back to an unusual event that occurred in the house at Laksegade 15 in 1826. On that bizarre day, people noticed that all sorts of debris were being chucked out of the house’s windows. Potatoes, peat, and other objects littered the street as a crowd began to gather. The onlookers could hear screams, laughs, curses, and swearing coming from inside the house as stuff continued to be hurled onto the street. Some people tried to peek inside the house to snag a glimpse of the source of the commotion. Some said they heard a deep, non-human growling, others said they saw a pair of glowing red eyes, and still more claimed to see no one at all. The police were called to investigate, but when they entered the house, everything stopped. It was completely empty, and there were no signs of any humans or animals. There weren’t even any clues that could lead them to any potential culprits. Because of this, people began speculating that the ruckus must have been the devil’s work.  The easiest way to get to Laksegade is either on foot or bike. It's not recommended to get there by car, as there are few parking spaces and the whole area is made up of one-way streets.",urban planning roads legends

Neither man nor God could save the church that was originally dedicated to Saint Lawrence of Rome. First built in the 14th century the brick chapel was the largest church in the region during its heyday. However around 1600, increasing desertification began taking its toll on the building. Rising levels of sand began to bury the foundations faster than they could be dug out, while sand found its way to the interior of the aging church through every crack and crevice. By the late 1700s the door was almost completely covered and had to be dug out regularly just to hold services. Despite the ever increasing issues with the church as it fell deeper and deeper into the sands, the owners of the church refused to let it be closed down. The tapestries and furniture were removed from the interior lest they be buried, and it was not until 1795 and with the permission of the King of Denmark that the Sand-Covered Church was finally closed. Most of the church was demolished, leaving around nine feet of wall standing, these were quickly wiped from the landscape by the shifting dunes. The tall main tower was left to jut from the sands, and it is this brick monolith that remains to this day. The Sand-Covered Church has been white-washed over the years and ownership transferred to a historical society, but the historic tower remains otherwise unaltered. The tower can be entered on certain days of the year and the view from the windows is a reminder of the building that lies beneath.",churches abandoned geology sacred spaces
203,Thingbæk Kalkminer,"Skørping, Denmark",An old limestone mine transformed into a beautiful and unusual sculpture museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thingbaek-kalkminer-limestone-mine,"Since 1935, the old Thingbæk limestone mine has been operating as a museum dedicated to sculpture. This distinctive, unusual exhibition space is beautiful and chilling, lit mostly by candles and kept at a temperature of about 45 degrees Fahrenheit year-round. As such, it’s a surprising and charming stop along an older two-lane highway that’s now usually bypassed by travelers who take the nearby (faster) freeway. The highlights of the mine are the gypsum sculptures created by the late Danish artist Anders Bundgaard, who was the first to place his plaster figures in the caves decades ago, as well as bronze sculptures by another late Danish sculptor, Carl Johan Bonnesen. Many of the imposing pieces displayed in Thingbæk served as early prototypes for massive sculptures that now dot public areas around Denmark, such as Bundgaard’s bronze Cimbrian Bull located in the center of Aalborg, and his Gefion Fountain located on the harbor in Copenhagen. Another big draw during the coldest months are the bat colonies that overwinter inside the mine museum. There are many hundred counted each year, and there are five species of bats that call the cave home between late autumn and late spring. And during certain holiday seasons, there are also concerts in the mine, as the crisp air and cave wall acoustics offer quite a spectacular experience. Recent changes are helping to make this place a destination for a younger generation. A new visitor center opened in 2015, and it now tempts the local “witch,” Dannie Druehyld, to occasionally emerge from her home in the surrounding forest to teach crochet workshops or tell kid-friendly mythical stories. (Yes, really.) And up the hill past the mine are several “land art” sculptures in the woods on a loop trail, pieces made from natural materials and now slowly decaying back into nature.  Thingbæk Kalkminer (Thingbæk Limestone Mine) is part of the Rebild cultural center located just off Hobrovej (Route 180).

204,Thagaard's Plantation,"Thisted, Denmark",A failed attempt to control drifting sands yielded a gnarled sylvan wonderland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thagaards-plantation,"In the 18th and the 19th centuries, the northwestern Jutland district of Thy was experiencing desertification, with driving North Sea winds blowing migrating dunes ever further inland, covering once-fertile agricultural land. The Danish government devised a strategy of planting forests on the shifting sands to halt their progress — a strategy which eventually worked, after some (ultimately picturesque) trial and error. One of the earliest such plantations was undertaken in 1816 and was named after Lauritz Thagaard, Denmark’s official “sand drift commissioner.” The project saw the introduction of Commons spruce, birch, Scotch pine, alder, European aspen, and willow trees to the area. However, the relentless winds, damp salt air, frosts, and local sheep eager to munch tender saplings made for tough going for the nascent forest. A plantation keeper was introduced in 1817 to look after the young trees, and dykes and ditches were constructed to protect them from the unforgiving climate, but it was all in vain; the project was abandoned in 1842. Though a failure, the lessons learned led to the more successful Tvorup dune plantations of the 1850s, which saw a hardier mountain pines take root and carpet the inhospitable dunes in a stable evergreen forest. It wasn’t only the land conservation project that was eventually a success, however. Many birch and spruce trees from Thagaard’s Plantation managed to survive and eventually thrive, growing slowly but surely and becoming gnarly and crooked from the prevailing winds.

205,CopenHill,"Copenhagen, Denmark",The world's first combination ski slope and power plant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/copenhill,"In the industrial neighborhood of Amager, CopenHill (known to locals as Amager Bakke) is the world’s first combination re-usable energy power plant and fully functioning ski slope. Its boxy silver exterior, lean gray smoke-billowing towers, and blinking red lights are viewable from throughout Copenhagen, but at the top of the 85-meter climb to the hill’s roof visitors will find a fully-operational dry slope for skiers and an observation look out with breathtaking views of the city. A ski lift and elevators are also available to help you make the ascent, and walking paths along the edge of the building offer a path for fitness enthusiasts who lack a fear of heights. If that doesn’t sound enough like spitting in the face of acrophobia, the world’s highest climbing wall is currently being constructed along one of the building’s tallest outside edges (it will be 85 meters tall by 10 meters wide and come directly off the side of the building) and is scheduled to open in spring 2020. Wisely, it will require certification to climb. The building, which cost some $650 million to construct, was designed by Danish architecture firm BIG as a grand gesture towards reaching Denmark’s goal of becoming the world’s first carbon-neutral city by 2025. The firm is also responsible for designing Denmark’s notoriously pink Superkilen, sci-fi sets for the show Westworld, and an enormous Tesla coil for a power station in London. The firm’s CEO Bjarke Ingels has called CopenHill, “a crystal clear example of hedonistic sustainability” with the plant boasting the potential to generate enough clean energy to deliver electricity to 150,000 homes per year by incinerating 440,000 tons of waste.  Visiting the slope is free, but if you want to ski you can buy a ticket and rent equipment in the gift shop at the base of the hill or online. Next to the gift shop is a cafe and bar which has a neo-viking aesthetic with sheepskin rugs and rustic light fixtures. Free parking for bicycles and cars is available in the lot next to the gift shop.",ski energy power stations sports architecture

After World War I, fueled by unrest and Hitler’s charismatic leadership, the Nazi Party grew in Germany. The Nazis blamed the Jews, Communists, liberals, and pacifists for the Great Depression, and promised to restore Germany’s standing in the world. Denmark declared itself a neutral party at the outset of World War II, but just a few months after the official start of the war Germany began occupying the territory. Over the course of the war, a resistance movement developed, and many Danish Jews escaped the country when German authorities ordered their internment as part of the Holocaust. Germany’s interest in the Danish territory was strategic—the Nazis hoped they could use its location to better attack Norway. They built about 50 bunkers in the Houvig area, many of which remain today, spread out in the dunes and along the beach. Now empty, dank, and graffitied, these weathered concrete blockhouses are nevertheless worth a visit for any history, architecture, or photography buff. They also form a wondrous hide-and-seek  playground for older children visiting the beach. And if you visit after dark, the bunkers provide the perfect platform from which to almost touch the profusion of stars in the heavens over the North Sea.

The cast iron fence posts in the garden sports several symbols, and you will find them inside the building, too. But there are not as many as there used to be. A large mosaic of swastikas was removed from the building around the late 1930s, after members of the Nazi party tended to gather there and salute the symbol. If you walk around the museum today, you will find odd, geometric ornaments flanking the windows. These were once swastikas but were re-chiseled into a series of geometric shapes to avoid the Nazi gatherings. The depictions of the swastika, an ancient icon historically used as a symbol of good luck, were actually incorporated into the museum nearly 40 years before the Nazis appropriated the design and ran it through their notoriously efficient propaganda machine. The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek museum was built to house the extensive art collection of Carl Jacobsen, which he gifted to the public in 1888. Jacobsen was the son of the founder of the Carlsberg brewery, J. C. Jacobsen, who named the brewery after his son. Carl’s relationship with his father was strained, so when he entered the beer brewing business as a young man in 1882, he named his brewery “New Carlsberg,” in part to spite his old man. The passionate art collector also adopted a swastika as his signature logo, and this trademark was incorporated throughout the art museum that bears his name. If you walk around the back of the building to the museum garden, you will find windows still featuring the original swastika design. The symbols here were kept in tact, possibly because no one would have noticed Nazis saluting behind the building.

208,BonBon Land,"Holmegaard, Denmark","The greatest amusement park in the world is wall-to-wall farting dogs, puking rats, and cows with exposed breasts for the whole family.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bonbon-land,"In Denmark, on the island of Zealand, a 45-minute drive from Copenhagen, lies a disgusting and magical world every family should experience. It began as BonBon, a candy factory in Home-Olstrup that successfully produced confections in the ‘80s and ‘90s with brazen names, such as Seagull Droppings, Large Boobs, Pee Diapers, Ear Wax, and Hundeprutter (“Dog Fart”). Naturally, children could not resist such delectable scatological treats. Numerous requests to visit the factory were met with rejection due to strict hygiene laws. No swimming in the chocolate river allowed in real life, kiddies. In 1992, the owner, Michael Spang expanded his successful business into the BonBon Land theme park, which eventually housed dozens of rides and characters with naughty names and personalities on par with the line of candies. The park originally offered simple duck boat rides in a pond, a movie theater, and a small candy factory and store. Although Spang wanted to create an amusement park for kids of all ages, there’s not much innocent about it. BonBon-Land quickly exploded into a massive 32-acre carnival of farting, defecating, and urinating character sculptures, many of whom are exposing large breasts with erect nipples. How can this be a family-friendly theme park? Because the Danish totally get it. Immature people of all ages want to goof off in a land filled with dirty cartoon animals and amplified fart sounds, and rightly so. Displayed across the grounds you will find a sewer rat who seems to be projectile vomiting urine, seagulls defecating into an alligator’s mouth, and voluptuous bovine breasts aplenty. Besides all of the animals that are excreting fluids and baring their ample bosoms, you’ll discover that most of the characters are either drunk or sick. Many of the animals resemble Disney characters with a twisted dose of perversion. The park offers age-appropriate attractions as long as the whole family is keen on potty humor: gentle rides for the young ones and 18+ coasters featuring even more vulgar displays of animal exhibitionism and muck flinging. Located dead center in the park is the Dog Fart Switchback (“Hundeprutterutchebane”). Although not the most high-powered rollercoaster, it is by far the most popular. Riders soar and glide over mounds of dog excrement while amplified fart sounds boom from a giant humiliated dog lifting his leg. He actually looks terrified about his lack of control. Henry the farting dog is also the mascot of the park, as you will find countless souvenirs of his likeness in the park’s gift shop, Paradise. For guests who want to skip right to the high-speed rides, the ‘”The Tomcat” (Hankatten) and “The Wild Boar” (Vild-Svinet) are the way to go. The latter, voted Denmark’s best roller coaster in 2003, is the park’s leader as far as sheer speed and G-force, taking passengers up a 97-degree ascent and topping out at over 45 mph. Other attractions at the park have irresistible names as well, such as the Worm, the Stud, Seagull Blobs, Horses Bulbs, Fold Cod, Crow Trees, the Horse Dropping, the Crazy Turtle, Skid Mark, Beaver Rafting, Dunce Cap, and Rubbish Dump. Also located within the park is Fantasy World, a walkthrough indoor playground, which according to BonBon Land’s website, houses Denmark’s largest collection of mechanical pixies, as well as “the colorful Mexico.”",amusement parks dogs animals

It’s the sole survivor of a lost 16th-century fortification. Jarmers Tower (Jarmers Tårn) is the only remnant of the old wall that once wrapped around Copenhagen. The tower, which was part of a fortification built in 1520, was named after the Wendish prince Jaromar II of Rügen, who in 1259 successfully attacked the city near the spot where the was later built. Originally, Jarmers Tower was one of 11 different defense towers. But as the city outgrew its wall, both the wall and most of its towers were lost to time. The sole surviving bit was restored after the area around it was excavated in the 1880s. Now, it stands preserved as a ruin within a small plaza also named after Jaromar.

Over the last 20 years, Bispetorvet’s very purpose has oscillated between town square and parking lot, never quite settling for either. In the early 20th century, a block of houses to make way for a garish palace-like office building on the square, complete with turrets and spires. When building material prices soared, the project was abandoned. The town bought the empty lot and Bispetorvet obtained its current size and shape. When the sandstone slabs that had been lining the square since 1921 had to be replaced in 2005, the town sent a delegation to approve the selection and quality of the stones at a quarry in Obernkirchen, Germany. Here they saw a pallet of sandstone that had been taken aside as it contained visible fossils found during quarrying. One of these fossils was the footprint of a dinosaur, that of a species similar to Allosaurus, and the delegation spontaneously decided that a fossilized dinosaur footprint was just what the square needed. The footprint was installed in 2006 alongside a tablet with a few general facts on Allosaurus, but not a word on how or why the footprint ended up there in the first place, possibly because no one really knew. Update May 2019: In April 2019 the footprint and the plaque were moved to the opposite side of the square, nearer to the theater. This was done because it was being damaged by people leaning their bicycles against it.  The dinosaur footprint is on the inside of the western wall of the square, opposite the theatre.

Alternately known as the “Swan Pharmacy” collection, the historic display of apothecary ingredients, equipment, and furniture has called the building home for more than 350 years. Originally, the chemist’s stores were located in a ground-floor storefront. But as medicinal technology evolved and the science improved, many of the ingredients and tools were found to be obsolete and were stored away in the house’s attic, and rarely touched again. Sitting in the attic as the centuries passed, the collection became a sort of time capsule of historic Danish medicine. Among the odd remedies on display are Spanish fly (which was said to aid the libido), dried buck blood, whale oil, and even a bottle of a miracle tonic known as “Theriak.” Made of dozens of ingredients including snake meat and opium, this magic potion was said to make the sick well. Today the collection of archaic medicines and remedies is still located in the attic of the Jen Bang House, and visitors can set up a tour of the weird larder.

The Troldkirken is known as the largest of the area’s neolithic long barrows with a capstone that is believed to weigh over 15,000 pounds. Of course such a Herculean creation earned the rock formation a suitably legendary myth. The barrow is said to have been created when a troll living outside the city of Sønderholm became annoyed with the ringing of the city’s church bells. As trolls of legend are so fond of doing, he freaked out and attempted to throw a boulder at the church, but his toss fell short of the city, landing atop the barrow and creating the “Troll Church” dolmen. The location was the first prehistoric site to be officially protected by the Danish government in 1809, and continues to be a popular destination today. The lovely countryside all around the barrow is breathtaking as well, although it would be wise to leave your church bells at home if you plan on exploring this scenic bit of prehistory.

They’re relics of World War II that have been transformed into a unique work of art. When Germany occupied Denmark during World War II, the beaches along the west coast of the Jutland Peninsula were marred by more than 7,000 concrete bunkers and fortifications. For decades after the war, these structures sat like ugly reminders of the international conflict. But in the 1990s, some of the bunkers were reborn as works of art. Danish Artist Elle-Mie Ejdrup Hansen was commissioned to mark the 50th anniversary of the war’s end with an art project. The collaborative project included works by 24 international artists and a musical composition by Danish jazz musician Palle Mikkelborg. One of the artists Elle-Mia Ejdrup Hansen invited to participate in the project was British sculptor Bill Woodrow. Woodrow had the idea to transform four of the unsightly, decaying bunkers into mules. He did this by attaching steel mule heads and tails onto the existing structures. The animal Woodrow chose wasn’t random. As mules are infertile, the artist used them to symbolically say that the terrors of war should not be able to reproduce.

216,Haraldskær Woman,"Vejle, Denmark","When this Iron Age bog body was discovered in 1835, it was thought that she had died recently.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haraldsk-r-woman,"In 1835, while excavating some peat on an estate in Jutland, Denmark, farmers found a female body lying supine in a bog. Once the farmers removed the layers of branches that covered the body, they saw that she was naked and had a leather cape and woolen garments folded atop her abdomen. If not for the antiquated garb, the farmers—because of the excellent condition of the body—thought the woman had died only recently. Once the body was taken to a lab for further examination, forensic biologists marveled at her well-preserved skin, deeply bronzed because of the tannins in the peat. Every single organ in her body remained intact, with no sign of degenerative disease. The doctors determined she was about 50 at her time of death in 490 B.C.; they determined she stood about 4’11”. In 2000, scientists revisited the case of the Hardaldskaer Woman (named for the estate where she was discovered), and found that her stomach content revealed a diet of unhusked millet and blackberries. They also found a distinct bruising around her neck, suggesting that a rope had once been tied around this area. Scientists also assumed that the woman had already died before the branches fell over her, pinning her body further down into the bog. Because of her nudity, careful placement in the bog, and since cremation was the most popular way to intern someone in that period of Jutland, the scientists deduced that the Haraldskaer Woman was a victim of religious sacrifice. Now the Haraldskaer Woman rests in an ornately carved sarcophagus in the St. Nicolai Church in Vejle, Denmark. There is only a simple glass covering over the body; she seems to rest peacefully as visitors the world over pay homage to one of the only human remains of the Iron Age. Update August 2018: Due to renovations, the church is closed until December 2019.

217,Dragsholm Castle,"Hørve, Denmark","Considered one of the most haunted places in Europe, this 800-year-old castle was home to noble prisoners.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dragsholm-castle,"Dragsholm Castle was built around 1215 by the Bishop of Roskilde. Located in the north of Zealand, it was originally built as a palace but was later fortified. It was the only castle on Zealand not to be taken during the Count’s Feud, a war of succession that raged across Denmark from 1534 to 1536. After the Count’s Feud and the ensuing Reformation in Denmark, the crown took control of Dragsholm Castle. For more than a century, Dragsholm was used as a prison for noble and ecclesiastical prisoners. Depending on the severity of their crimes, these prisoners were kept in conditions ranging from reasonable comfort to abject misery. The most famous prisoner to be held in its walls was James Hepburn, the fourth Earl of Bothwell. Lord Bothwell was a man with a certain charm and a talent for finding trouble. By his mid-30s he had racked up a string of scandals including multiple marriages, adultery, divorce, and bankruptcy. Most notably, he was the third and final husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. It was also widely believed that Bothwell had murdered Mary’s previous husband, Lord Darnley. This caused a rift in the country that came to a head at the Battle of Carberry Hill. Bothwell lost the battle and promptly fled to Denmark, where he was detained and eventually imprisoned in Dragsholm. By all accounts, he was kept in truly awful conditions: For the last 10 years of his life, he was chained to a pillar half his own height, unable to stand upright. The pillar can still be seen at Dragsholm, surrounded by a circular groove dug in the floor by the enchained Lord Bothwell’s shuffling. Bothwell died in the castle in 1578. During the Dano-Swedish War of 1658–1660, the Swedish king Charles X Gustav tried to blow up Dragsholm Castle. While not entirely destroyed, the castle was badly damaged and lay in ruins for a number of years. The king later gave the castle to a nobleman and grocer named Heinrich Müller, and in 1694 it was sold to the nobleman Frederik Christian Adeler. These two men restored the castle in the Baroque style of their time, creating the castle that we see today (at least on the exterior; the interior has been modernized to some degree). Today, Dragsholm Castle is a tourist attraction, and home to a hotel and restaurant. But the past still clings to it—especially if you believe in ghosts. Many paranormal enthusiasts consider the castle one of the most haunted places in Europe, and it is supposedly home to around 100 different ghosts. Phantasmal residents are said to include a woman in white, believed to be the ghost of Celina Bolves, who was allegedly sealed inside the walls by her father as punishment for a dalliance with a common laborer. The Grey Lady, meanwhile, is a friendly ghost who in life was done a great favor (what that favor was varies depending on the source) and now wanders Dragsholm as a happy spirit. Then, of course, there’s the ghost of Lord Bothwell, which has been spotted multiple times. Most famously, witnesses claim to have seen Bothwell riding through the castle courtyard with full horse and carriage, perhaps still trying to escape from the decade-long torment he suffered at Dragsholm Castle.  Dragsholm Castle is located at Dragsholm Allé 1, 4534 Hørve, in Zealand, Denmark, about 50 miles west of Copenhagen. The castle is now a Relais & Châteaux hotel with two restaurants. If you can’t stay overnight, you can reserve a table at one of the restaurants and maybe you’ll see a ghost or two over lunch (table reservations are required).",jails ghosts haunted prisons castles

Built in the middle of a lake that provides a defensive moat, the castle has been home to the same family since 1784. A story has been passed down through the generations about the wooden doll in the castle’s attic. The legend states that if the wooden doll is moved from its cushion on the rafters, then the castle will sink into the moat on Christmas Eve. Previous generations that lived within the castle refused to spend Christmas at the castle, fearing that the ominous tale would come true. However, the current occupants, Count Ahlefeldt-Laurvig-Bille and his family have instead taken on a Danish festive tradition that is usually reserved for elves.

Cirkelbroen is 130 feet (40 meters) long, made of steel, and consists of five interlinked platforms, each with its own mast held up by metal wires.

But you’ll also notice animals and phrases that symbolize the vices of the Danish politicians and remind them that their true role is to serve the people. These latter details were not part of the original plan—Larsen added them after deciding the flowers were too boring. His decision to include the unflattering symbols and sayings earned him the nickname of “the evil painter.” If you follow the frieze, you can see that the more Larsen painted, the more ironic his comments became. According to local lore, his additions infuriated the then-Minister of the Interior, Ove Rode, so much that Rode withheld his salary. Because of this, the “evil painter” included the phrase “Do not pick the fruit until it is ripe. If weeds have to be eliminated, don’t forget Rode” in the frieze, using a variation of “rødder” (roots) to poke fun at the politician.

The site is named after the first work to be placed in the area, a giant wooden snake painted bright yellow with a hollow body that people can crawl through (skovsnogen means “forest snake” in Danish), and the privately-owned patch of forest in West Jutland has been accumulating equally strange and grand works of art ever since. To date, the works of over 50 separate artists have been installed on the land, with more appearing, some for good, some just for a bit, every year.  A majority of the pieces are fairly grand in scale, represented by shacks, huts, tall sculptures, and other works which are meant to be interacted with by visitors. Among the many and varied constructions on display are a massive insect with a geometrically angular abdomen, a full size car that is crushed beneath a huge boulder, and giant perfume bottle made of red stone. The various huts that people an enter each carries its own identity as well be it a faux pirate radio station or a hidden room in a stark abstract factory construction. The open air gallery also plays host to a number of performance pieces year round as the weather itself changes the tenor of the natural space.

223,Østerlars Church,"Gudhjem, Denmark",The largest of Denmark's seven mysterious round churches stands on an island in the Baltic Sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/osterlars-church,"Alabaster white with coal black tarred shingles on the roof, Østerlars Kirke is Bornholm’s biggest and oldest round church. It’s one of four of these intriguing structures found on the Danish island. Østerlars Church dates to around 1150, though its roof was added much later. The building originally served as both a place of worship and a fortified refuge against seafaring invaders. Its origins are a bit of a mystery. One theory maintains that round churches are often associated with the Knights Templar, but no one really knows for sure who built them or why. Another theory attributes the building’s shape to its possible use as an observatory. Historic murals, which depict the birth of Christ, the gates of hell, and various foreboding Judgement Day scenarios, are a good reason to venture inside. Dating to roughly 1350, they were painted over during the Reformation like many frescos in Denmark’s oldest churches. Fortunately, these were uncovered in the 1800s and restored to their full brilliance in 1958. The church chimes are located in the neighboring bell tower. Today, the medieval church remains a hub of modern activity. It still holds regular services, and tourists are welcome to wander through when services aren’t in session.  Services are held on Sunday, and the church is open to the public all days of the week.",christianity murals medieval churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
224,Hair Jewelry Exhibit at the Bangsbo Museum,"Frederikshavn, Denmark",The largest collection of hair jewelry in Europe reminds you how creepy 19th-century love was.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hair-jewelry-exhibit-bangsbo-museum,"Hair jewelry – braided bracelets, twisted watch chains, curled necklaces and the like – is pretty “ick”-inducing to us today. Modernity thinks of hair as a dead thing – on our bodies and off of it. But traditionally, one’s hair was conceived of as an undying part of oneself, to live on as a remembrance long after the physical body had decayed. For example, Civil War soldiers often left a lock at home to be made into jewelry if they met unfortunate fates. But the tradition of hair jewelry as we think of it today was revived in the Scandinavian countries out of dire necessity in the 19th century. In many Swedish villages, harvests had been particularly bad for the previous years and this, coupled with a depression, put men and women on the verge of starvation and bankruptcy. Faced with these circumstances, women revived the nearly-archaic tradition of bijouterie, or handcrafted jewelry, using human hair. In the case of their rediscovered craft, time was on their side. Throughout Europe during the time of the Napoleonic wars, gold and silver weren’t readily available. Hair jewelry was the perfect alternative. These country women, eventually called “hårkullor,” or hair ladies, started making all varieties of jewelry, including brooches and rings, with the customer’s hair and the name of his or her loved one wrapped into it. Instantly recognizable because of their traditional dress, the “hårkullor” travelled around Europe, selling their wares, training apprentices, and sending money back to sustain their small villages. Soon, the rest of Europe adopted the craft, expanding the uses of hair for large-scale landscape “paintings” and floral designs. Even Queen Victoria got in on the trend. Home of the largest collection of human hair trinkets in Europe, the Bangsbo Museum displays the wares of the “hårkullor” in a permanent exhibit. Made creepier and probably mustier by the centuries that have passed since their creation, the museum’s repository includes hair watch chains, usually made for men out of their wives’ hair, and bracelets, necklaces and rings worn by women made from their husband’s clipped locks. Wreaths and plaques made from the hair of dead relatives, amongst other oddities like human hair mittens, are also on display. Worth a trip for the original Christmas gift ideas!

225,St. Canute's Cathedral,"Odense, Denmark",The last Viking king of Denmark is buried inside the crypt of this cathedral.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-canutes-cathedral,"St. Canute’s Cathedral is a Gothic, red brick building constructed in the 1300s. The church is named after Danish King Canute IV, who was murdered at this location. He ruled Denmark from 1080 to 1086 and was later canonized. According to legend, Canute was murdered in the cathedral when he tried to force the Jutland peasants to form a war party and attack England. With him was his brother, Benedict, and 17 hirdmen (followers). They were killed in front of the altar inside a wooden church that predated the current building. Today, the bones of Canute and his brother Benedict rest in the crypt below the cathedral. Also buried in the crypt are King Hans, Queen Christine, Prince Frants, Christian II, and Queen Elizabeth. Inside the church is a gilded, wooden triptych carved by Claus Berg. The triptych consists of three panels and illustrates the sufferings of Christ.",burial places churches sacred spaces history & culture architecture
226,Himmelbjerget,"Ry, Denmark",Denmark's famous pseudo-hill.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/himmelbjerget,"The Himmelbjerget Hill, or “Sky Mountain,” is one of the highest points in Denmark, reaching 147 meters. Oddly enough, geologists have robbed some of the hill’s pride by saying it is a “fake” hill. After the Ice Age was over, glacial streams created subglacial stream trenches which later formed the pseudo-hill. According to geologists, a “real” hill is evenly rounded on all sides. The Himmelbjerget reportedly became famous when a group of students were walking up the “pseudo” hill and being so impressed with its beauty, wrote to Danish poet Steen Steensen Blicher and asked him to hold a popular meeting there. The next year he did exactly that and thousands of people were invited to the Himmelbjerget. Taken over by excitement, Blicher forgot to ask permission from the property holder, a local farmer, and a quarrel started between the two. It was soon solved when the king at the time visited the area and leased it from the owner (later gaining absolute ownership), allowing people to enjoy the Himmelbjerget for free. The tower erected at the top of the Himmelbjerget was built in commemoration of King Frederik VII who in 1849 gave the Danish people free constitution. The tower was 25 meters high and completed in 1875. Scattered throughout the rest of the hill are a bunch of little monuments, including a small wooden hut hidden in the woods that visitors are encouraged to look for.

227,Museumsgården,"Læsø, Denmark",This antique farmhouse is one of Læsø's rare seaweed houses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museumsgarden,"Museumsgården, which is part of the Læsø Museum, is a preserved farm that acts as an open-air museum. Visiting the museum offers a glimpse of the past, letting visitors get a sense of a time when men spent large chunks of the year out at sea and women tended to the farms. The museum’s artifacts and interior decor act like a time capsule of life on Læsø. Its most recent owner, Sine Krogbæk, lived on the farm up until 1949. She made few changes to the old building, so it looks much as it did when her family first moved into the property around 1860. While there, be sure to take a close look at the farmhouse’s roof. The quaint white building is snuggly capped with a silvery roof of dried seaweed. Roofs like these are unique to Læsø, and around 250 such tangtag once peppered its villages. After the salt industry deforested the island, the locals were forced to turn to the sea when searching for building materials. They used a blend of seagrass and seaweed to top their houses, creating thick, rounded roofs that eventually hardened and became waterproof. Using seaweed in this way declined in the mid-1900s. A disease in the 1930s killed much of the seaweed around the island, and reforestation efforts meant there was once again a healthy supply of timber for people to top their homes with. Now, only a couple dozen of these seaweed roof buildings still exist on Læsø.  Tours can be arranged by emailing museum@laeso.dk. Each tour lasts approximately one hour. To get to Læsø, you can take the Læsø Ferry from Frederikshavn or catch a flight via the Copenhagen Air Taxi from Roskilde. You can get around the island by renting a car, electric bike, or even an Icelandic horse!",seaweed preservation museums architecture
228,Nellemann's Have,"Sæby, Denmark",This historic orchard contains Northern Europe's largest collection of paradise apple trees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nellemanns-have-garden,"The small town of Sæby has one seriously impressive collection of paradise apple trees, part of a lovely garden called Nelleman’s Have. Like a lot of landscaped areas in northern Denmark, this orchard and lush cultivated flower garden abuts a wilder forested area, which is also open to any and all visitors who feel like taking a stroll in the woods. Founded in 1925 by a local land inspector and aspiring fruit farmer Nicolai Nellemann, the late apple enthusiast’s eponymous garden is said to contain somewhere between 200 and 300 varietals of paradise apples. After Nicolai Nellemann died in 1976, his son Ib kept improving the garden and grew the orchard to about 1,000 trees of about 400 varietals until his own death in 1991. After Ib Nellemann’s death, the estate was neglected and became quite run down due to a lack of general upkeep and care. But locals knew they had something special in their midst that just needed a bit of attention to flourish once again. In 2008, a group formed to keep the lovely garden free and open to the public, and to keep cultivating the trees and improve a few features around the garden. Most notable as of 2019, there are several nice flat trails for walking about and an open-air, covered building to enjoy a packed lunch or snag some shade along the easily navigable paths among the trees.  Nellemann's Have is especially beautiful to visit in the springtime when the apple trees bloom. The garden is free and open every day of the year, sunrise to sunset.",orchards apples fruit gardens trees plants
229,'Scenarie',"Albertslund, Denmark",An artist has turned what most people would consider a bathroom nightmare into a work of political art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/scenarie,"When walking from the Albertslund commuter train station in Denmark, the sight of a man in a tub screaming in horror while his bathroom is flooded by sewage will probably catch your eye. The odd fountain is the work of Danish artist Peter Land, who created “Scenarie” in 2008. The artist uses the piece to raise the question of what happens when the social framework that forms the basis of a society breaks down or is challenged. Much like a well-functioning bathroom, a well-functioning society is something people take for granted. These bathroom structures breaking down could, according to Land, be described as a plumber’s nightmare; a metaphor for what would happen if society should suffer a similar fate. Land is also aware of the response art like this can provoke, particularly from members of the community who pass it often. The fact that the piece elicits strong reactions was especially evident when, two months after it was unveiled, someone beheaded the man sitting in the tub.  ""Scenarie"" is located right outside of the north exit of the Albertslund commuter train station in Copenhagen.",bathrooms fountains public art sculptures art
230,Elia,"Herning, Denmark",This huge industrial sculpture looks like a UFO and a factory had a baby.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elia,"Visible in an ominous flash from the train on the way to Herning, Denmark the huge sculpture known as Elia is a jarring black tribute to industrial design via an abstract vision of Hell. Elia is the creation of Danish sculptor Ingvar Cronhammar whose works often take the shape of angular abstractions that look like nothing so much as art deco flourishes come to life. Finished in 2000, Elia itself is a massive, 200-foot in diameter dome that is capped by four towers that resemble the smokestacks of a mid-century factory. Four equally spaced staircases lead to the top of the dome where visitors can peer down a shaft located between the towering stacks. Most of the time the dark shaft seems to simply lead endlessly into the ground but at a random interval once every 18 days, a gout of flame issues from the depths. The entire work is constructed of pure black metal save for the red caps atop each of the smokestacks which are illuminated each night, giving the piece an even more demonic quality. Beneath the dome itself, the ground has been carved into a concave bowl and when it storms in the area, the whole piece acts as a giant drum, amplifying any thunder in a dreadful roar. Visitors cannot enter the depths of Elia, but even from the outside, the sculpture’s rather imposing atmosphere is communicated for miles around.",gates to hell industrial sculptures
231,Submerged Sculpture of Hans Christian Andersen,"Odense, Denmark","After funding was cut for a memorial to the Danish author, the sculptor had his statue ceremonially lowered into the city harbor.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hans-christian-andersen-odense-harbour,"Odense is the hometown of Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875) and the city has plenty of monuments commemorating the world-renowned fairy tale author. Few of them, though, have been involved in such controversy as the 10-foot (three-meter) bronze figure of Andersen created by local artist Jens Galschiøt. For five years, the sculpture stood outside the Odense City Hall waiting to become part of The Storyteller’s Well, a planned fountain dedicated to the world of Andersen’s fairy tales. The whole project was, however, literally buried after the city council cut the funding and failed to find a suitable downtown location for the artwork. Galschiøt was disappointed, to say the least. On October 8, 2011, as a symbolic protest against bureaucracy, the sculptor arranged a public “burial” for his statue. A brass band played while a horse-drawn carriage transported the €250,000-sculpture from the city center to the harbor, where it was lifted up in the air by a crane before slowly being submerged into the water in front of hundreds of “mourners” devouring free hot dogs and “funeral beer.” Some locals found the happening disrespectful, while others were pleased that the author of The Little Mermaid and The Ugly Duckling now was physically closer to some of his fairy tale characters. Half a year later on April 2, 2012, Galschiøt “resurrected” the figure and brought it back to dry land for a combined celebration of Easter and Andersen’s birthday. After, the statue toured Denmark for a while before eventually being sold to a golf club. This could have been the end to what some call “a modern Hans Christian Andersen story” if it hadn’t been for a final twist: One morning, the sculpture seemed to have returned to its former spot in the harbor basin. It turned out, though, that Galschiøt had installed a reproduction during the night. This substitute statue has resided in the docks without permission for over a decade now.  From Odense Central Station, you can reach the sculpture by foot in about 10 minutes. It's located below Odense Havnebad, the public outdoor swimming pool.",children's literature fairytales authors sculptures statues
232,Hals Whale Jaws,"Hals, Denmark",A small Denmark town displays a pair of titanic jaw bones as their community symbol.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hals-whale-jaws,"In the small town of Hals, Denmark there are two tall bones standing on one end of the town square. The bones, which once belonged to a massive Blue Whale, let visitors literally walk into a whale’s mouth. The original whale, who “donated” its bones, was shot back in 1868 in the Barents Sea by Captain C. Klitgaard, a resident of Hals. After returning with his tragic-to-modern-sensibilities kill, the blue whale’s jaw bones were removed, bleached, and given a new life as a local landmark. These first jaws were destroyed in 1953 when a truck hit the fragile old bones. Sadly, the remains were not worth trying to save. Luckily for them, the town did not have to continue without their beloved bones for long. A new jaw was donated to the city in 1955 by the consul of Sandefjord in Norway, Lars Christensen. One of Norway’s greatest whalers, Thor Dahl from Sandefjord delivered a new set of jaws to the port in Aarhus, on April 27, 1955. The new jaws, which were taken from the largest animal in the world, the blue whale, dwarfed the previous mouthpieces. Judging from the size of the bones, the original creature is thought to have measured almost 100 feet long and weigh about 90 tons. The whale jaws from 1955 are kept in the museum, safe from the elements and bolting trucks. They are replaced by a more durable replica from glass fiber. Even though it is a replica, you will still be in awe standing in front of the imposing monument. They are a popular attraction, especially for children who are not burdened by any moral quandaries the bones might present, and who also find it fun to stand inside the mouth of a blue whale.",whales bones animals

The author was born in Odense, the son of a shoemaker and a washerwoman. At the age of 14, he moved to Copenhagen, where he would call home for most of his life. Though Andersen loved to travel (the large leather trunk he carried on those journeys is on display at the Copenhagen airport) he never settled anywhere else. Andersen died in 1875, at the age of 70. The composer J.P.E. Hartmann was a close friend, and one of the last people to visit the author before his death. Andersen’s health had been growing worse for several years, and the two reportedly discussed what music would be played at his funeral. On August 11, 1875, Andersen’s funeral was held at the Cathedral of Our Lady in Copenhagen. He was buried in Assistens Cemetery, where he originally shared a burial plot with his friend Edvard Collin, and Collin’s wife Henriette. In 1914, the Collins’ tombstone was moved to another cemetery. A new gravestone was put in place, but only included Andersen’s name and the dates of his birth and death. His gravestone and the location are much more modest than one might expect, but nevertheless get regular visits from fans.
