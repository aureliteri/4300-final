0,Ash Jesus and Ash Buddha,Macau,Sculptures of religious figures made from the ashes of pilgrims' incense.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ash-jesus,"Using the resurrected ashes from temple incense in Shanghai, Chinese artist Zhang Huan created the torsos of two of the most prominent religious figures in the world. Standing over 8 feet tall, Ash Jesus and Ash Buddha were recently displayed in Macau. In a kind of religious showdown, the figures were installed facing each other; Jesus with hands outstretched, and Buddha sitting cross-legged, the perfect embodiment of tranquility. These massive sculptures are two of many impressive works of art by Huan that incorporate the ashes of incense carried by pilgrims. Using steel, and wood as a frame, the sculptures were layered in ash, giving them a deathly and eerie look and adding further complexity and symbolism. Huan hoped the figures would show similarities between the Eastern and Western religions, and the two ash deities were shown in as a part of a larger exhibition entitled “East Wind, West Wind.”  This exhibit was a temporary exhibit sponsored by Louis Vuitton at their Flagship store at One Central Mall, NAPE, Macau. - The exhibition ran from April to June 2011 in their special art exhibit, ESpace. As such this temporary exhibit is no longer available in Macau",giant buddhas outsider art statues
1,Old Protestant Cemetery,Macau,The final resting place of 19th-century sailors previously banned from being buried within Portuguese Macau.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-protestant-cemetery,"Macau, a small peninsula southwest of Hong Kong, is mainly known for its flashy casinos. Dig a bit deeper, and you’ll find a trove of historical treasures hiding among the luxurious hotels and glitzy attractions. For several hundred years, Macau was a colony of Portugal, which left behind distinctive historical and cultural sites. But the Old Protestant Cemetery is unique among Macau’s graveyards, as most of those interred there are neither Portuguese nor Chinese. The Portuguese colonists viewed the peninsula as sacred Roman Catholic ground. As such, they prohibited any Protestants from being buried within the city limits. And on the outside of the city walls, the Chinese refused to allow any foreigners to be laid to rest within the land. This left Protestant sailors and merchants—many from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Northern Europe—in a tough situation. They were forced to bury their dead secretly at night, risking dangerous confrontations with the Chinese officials and left to do nothing but hope that the unsanctioned graves they dug wouldn’t be defaced or destroyed as punishment. In 1821, the non-Catholic, non-local merchants finally gained access to their own burial grounds, thanks to the British East India Company’s decision to buy a plot of land to use as a graveyard. People originally buried outside the city limits were exhumed and reburied at the cemetery. By 1858, the graveyard had already filled. The cemetery closed and a new one was opened, earning this one the title of the Old Protestant Cemetery. You’ll find some interesting graves within the cemetery, including those of the artist George Chinnery and missionary Robert Morrison. You’ll also spot the resting places of many fascinating seamen, including a cabin boy who died of “a fall into the hold.” Keep a particular eye out for the grave that says “Secret to the memory” instead of “Sacred to the memory.”  The cemetery is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. It's located just off the entrance to the lovely Luis de Camões Park, which is also well worth a visit.",sailors christianity colonialism graveyards graves gravestones burial places cemeteries
2,Taipa Houses,"Taipa, Macau",These pastel-colored homes were built when the island of Macau was a Portuguese colony.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taipa-houses,"These Portuguese-style homes show a different Macau, far from the lights of casinos. The Taipa Houses were built in 1921, to serve as the residences of senior civil servants when the island was a colony of Portugal. (Macau was a Portuguese colony from 1557 until 1999, when the rule was transferred to the People’s Republic of China.) In 1992, the regional government renovated the houses and turned them into a museum. In 2016, the houses became home to the Macanese Living Museum, which includes artistic and cultural artifacts as well as recreations of what these houses looked like when they were initially built.",colonialism houses museums architecture
3,Batu Caves,"Batu Caves, Malaysia","Holy Hindu shrine in an enormous, monkey-filled limestone cavern.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/batu-caves,"During Thaipusam, an annual celebration of the triumph of good over evil, hundreds of thousands of spiritual pilgrims climb the 272 stairs up into the Batu Caves carrying kavadis, symbolic burdens which include elaborate body piercings. This is the Malaysian version of a Hindu festival celebrated among the Tamil community in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Thaipusam comes from the junction of two words, the Tamil month called “Thai” and a star, named “Pusam.” Observed each year in January or February according to the Tamil calendar, the festival of Thaipusam honors the Hindu god Murugam and his victory over the demon Surapadman with his vel, or lance. Festivalgoers wearing yellow or orange observe traditions including shaving of the head, and carry kavadis representing the fulfillment of vows to Murugam, thanking him for favors done or in advance for future favors sought. The most common kavadis are fruit, flowers, or a pail of milk, but others are as elaborate as heavy peacock-feather covered shrines carried on the head, representing the defeated demon who was transformed into a peacock. The most famous images of the festival are of devotees with cheeks and tongues pierced with ceremonial lances, and others hauling large kavadis with hooks in their backs. The piercings, along with fasting and ritual, induce a trance-like state intended to focus thoughts inward. At the caves a swami removes the piercings, lifting the spiritual burden. Located seven miles north of Kuala Lumpur, the caves were made famous in 1878 by zoologist William Temple Hornaday, better known for the time he put a Pygmy tribesman on display in the monkey house at New York’s Zoological Park. During Malaysia’s colonial heyday, the caves were a popular site for picnicking British couples. The stairs were added in more recent times. The gallery of the main Temple Cave at the top of the stairs is 300 feet high and 1200 feet long, with small openings letting in natural light. A smaller gallery is up another fight of stairs, mostly open to the sky. Two other smaller caves are also at the site. In 2006, a 140-foot tall concrete statue of Murugan was added at the foot of the stairs in the weeks preceding Thaipusam, a giant chrysanthemum garland draped around his shoulders by construction crane. The caves are home to colonies of long tailed-macaque monkeys which roam the stairs and the caves, and have been known to swipe sunglasses, cameras, and snacks from tourists. In 2009, more than a million people visited the caves during Thaipusam.  From Kuala Lumpur, take the KTM commuter train from KL Sentral station to the Batu Caves Station. Batu Caves station is the eighth (8th) station from KL Sentral. You can also take the public bus (11 and 11d). The public buses can be boarded at the Pudu Raya Bus Terminal in Kuala Lumpur. If you're two or more people traveling together, and it isn't a rush hour yet, think of taking Grab taxi, called also ""Asia's Uber.” When looking for something more adventurous make sure to check out tours offered by ""Dark Cave Malaysia"" company, operating on the grounds of the Batu Caves. During these tours you'll have a chance to enter part of the Batu Caves seen only by relatively few. If you are hungry, don't head straight back to the city center. Instead, try South Indian traditional Dhosa at one of the Indian restaurants situated right next to the caves. You can't miss them, since there are always people dining.",hinduism monkeys shrines rites and rituals caves ecosystems sacred spaces statues
4,Kampung Kuantan Fireflies Park,"Bestari Jaya, Malaysia",Malaysian fireflies create a dazzling display as thousands light up in unison.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flashing-fireflies-kampung-kuantan,"A small number of firely species perform an astonishing collective trick: They light up as one. Tens of thousands of fireflies will blink in perfect unison for minutes, sometimes hours, at a time. Known as “sychronicity,” it is a somewhat mysterious phenomenon. Even though each firefly flashes according to its own natural rhythm, it also receives feedback from flashing lights nearby. This feedback loop, an example of the mathematical concept known as coupled oscillation, eventually leads to a humongous mass of simultaneously blinking fireflies. One of the best places in the world to see this magnificent display is in Kampung Kuantan, Malaysia. Sadly, over the last ten years the beetle has been disappearing from the region due to poorly managed tourism and river pollution. All is not lost, however. Thriving colonies can still be found in the Bagan Krian mangrove tracts, the Tanjung Piai mangrove regions, and the Cherating and Kemaman shorelines, among other places.",bioluminescence bug week insects animals
5,The Pinnacles of Gunung Mulu,"Marudi, Malaysia",These jagged limestone blades cut out through the canopy of the jungles of Borneo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-pinnacles-of-gunung-mulu-marudi-malaysia,"High atop the Malaysian mountain Gunung Mulu is an impressive alien landscape made of sharp rock spires that rise up out of the surrounding jungle like spikes of angry earth. The climb to the Pinnacle of Gunung Mulu is gruelling and dangerous, so much so that the national park is sometimes used by the Malaysian Army for training. However, those who are daring enough to make the trek to the top of the mountain will be rewarded with one of the most unique and stunning vistas in the world. The tall stone spikes known as the Pinnacles of Gunung Mulu are stark karst formations that were created as the soft limestone eroded away across millennia. Hidden so far up the mountain, the formations are relatively untouched by humankind and the only people to be seen for miles are other pilgrims to the bizarre bit of topography.  It usually takes a couple of days to reach the rock outcropping that serves as a viewing platform for the Pinnacles. Along the way, hikers encounter pitcher plants and toucans along with the grueling terrain. However, ladders and railings have been installed to help with the trek as much as they can. The park at large is also home to a number of large caves that make an excellent accompaniment to a visit to the Pinnacles.",rocks geological oddities geology
6,Niah Caves,"Miri, Malaysia",One of the largest caverns in the world has a maw large enough to stack cathedrals in.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/niah-caves,"One of Borneo’s many and varied natural wonders, the Niah Caves are a system of colossal underground chambers large enough to fit a couple of Notre Dame Cathedrals stacked on top of one another. They also contain some of the earliest human remains ever found in Malaysia. The initial excavations into the Niah caves began in 1950s and ’60s when evidence of human habitation in the caves was found, including cave paintings and remains. The remains were found to be a staggering 40,000 years old, meaning the natural caves have been fascinating homo sapiens from cavemen to the camera-happy tourists of today. The cave paintings were found to only be around 1,200 years old, making them nonetheless interesting, but paling in comparison to the ancient bones. Today, the caves are a popular tourist site owing to their awe-inspiring size and natural beauty. The entrance to the main “Great Cave” alone is dozens of meters tall, inviting metaphorical measures such as how many churches or other huge structures could fit in it. No matter how you describe the caves, it is likely that it will be tinged with a sense of wonder.  Before entering the caves, you need to visit the Niah National Park office to purchase a ticket. The caves are about a 40-minute walk from the office. Because the caves are dark and slippery, bring a flashlight and sensible walking shoes.",subterranean caves natural wonders ecosystems nature
7,Langkawi Sky Bridge,"Langkawi, Malaysia",This dangerous-looking suspension bridge may have been too unstable to remain open.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/langkawi-sky-bridge,"Curving wide around a forested mountain peak, the Langkawi Sky Bridge in Malaysia is an impressive feat of engineering, or so it would seem since the bridge has been closed for years with not much chance of reopening. Constructed in 2005, the steel skybridge is a pedestrian thoroughfare that allowed visitors to take a scenic stroll high above the lush forests of the Gunung Mat Chinchang mountain. After a tram ride to the foot of the bridge, the walkway winds almost leisurely around the very tips of a trio of mountains. The path is suspended over 2,000 feet above sea level by a single massive pylon that trails thick steel cables down to the bridge. The pieces of the over 400-foot bridge were lifted onto the mountain via helicopter and constructed at elevation. It looks both futuristic and almost frighteningly precarious. And as it turns out, these fears might be justified. After being open for a scant few years, it closed in 2012 for renovations and repairs. It partially reopened in February 2015 and is now fully accessible. Hikers can head to the nearby Seven Wells waterfall and hike to the summit of Gunung Mat Chinchang. It’s a tough, but easy to follow trek, that will take you between 1-3 hours one way, depending on your fitness level. The views are totally worth the struggle. There is no public transport in Langkawi and the place is quite far away (6+ miles) from the most popular areas of the island - Cenang and Kuah. So you will need either to rent a scooter, car or get a taxi.",engineering bridges architectural oddities architecture
8,BOH Tea Garden and Factory,"Cameron Highlands, Malaysia",The largest tea plantation in Southeast Asia supplies gorgeous vistas alongside tea for the surrounding countries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boh-tea-plantation-and-factory,"The largest tea plantation in Malaysia is a massive spread of acres that supplies almost all of the tea for the considerable demand in the surrounding countries. It is also loaded with a natural beauty all its own. Founded during the British colonial era by the British businessman J. A. Russel, the plantation has grown considerably since 1929. It has expanded from a small tract of land in Habu to acres of tea-growing sites in Cameron Highlands. The cool climate and the rich soil of this province provide a fertile ground for cultivating tea. The name BOH comes from “Bohea”, the hills in Fujian Province where tea was originally thought to have been discovered. During World War II, the estate was occupied by the Japanese and largely abandoned. After Malaysia declared independence from the British Empire in 1957, many British planters left the country. But the Russels remained in Malaysia, and the company grew as they acquired several other tea farming operations. Today, at over 8,000 acres, the BOH tea plantation is the largest in Southeast Asia. BOH also processes its harvest in its own factory located in Sungai Palas. In the same site is the in-house cafe and gift shop where guests can purchase the varieties of tea produced in the factory.",tea farms colonialism food

10,Bamboo Playhouse,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",A delightful architectural wonder awaits on a lake island in Kuala Lumpur’s oldest park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bamboo-playhouse,"Designed by Malaysian architect Eleena Jamil, the Bamboo Playhouse is a public pavilion located in Kuala Lumpur’s Perdana Botanical Gardens. The sustainable playhouse features a three-dimensional floorscape and tree-like columns that rise up to support the roof, offering a playful reprieve for the public that blends into the surrounding landscape. The playhouse is situated on a small island in a large lake that stretches across the center of the gardens. The structure also contains a series of hanging “tree-houses” made from bamboo baskets, where visitors can enjoy meditative views of the lake. The playhouse has also been used as an event space for performances and exhibitions. The design also features raised square platforms set at various levels to create different dimensions across the open structure. Jamil took her inspiration from traditional structures called wakafs, which serve as resting places for village communities in Malaysia. Contemporary architectural designs made of bamboo are a rare sight in Malaysia, but the playhouse is a creative example of how the sustainable material can be used in fun new ways for other structures. According to Dezeen, “The Bamboo Playhouse was shortlisted [in 2015] for an award for a World Architecture Festival, where bamboo was touted as a revolutionary building material by Dirk Hebel.”  The Bamboo Playhouse is open daily from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.",botanical gardens architectural oddities architecture

This century-old Buddhist temple, built in dedication to Guan Yin, the bodhisattva of compassion, offers a rare tranquility within the bustling confines of Kuala Lumpur.

13,Bukit Bintang Street Art Alleys,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Cartoon clouds and nature-inspired murals have transformed the streets of Kuala Lumpur.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bukit-bintang-street-art-alleys,"Bukit Bintang, meaning Starhill, is one of Kuala Lumpur’s most-visited districts. It’s home to some of the city’s biggest and most expensive shopping malls and restaurants as well as the street food mecca of Jalan Alor. Jalan Alor is one of the best-known jalans, or roads, of the district. Some of these were known for the same unsavory characteristics many major city back alleys throughout the world are known for. But in the late 2010s, Kuala Lumpur City Hall decided to transform these streets into art projects. Most of the murals that now decorate Bukit Bintang’s most infamous jalans were started in mid-2018 and completed in December of that year. A majority of the artwork in these central alleys dividing Bukit Bintang’s major city blocks comes in the form of painted murals with bright colors and natural imagery like rivers, rainforests, and tropical Southeast Asian fauna. A more novelty art type on display here are neon sculptures of cartoony cloud silhouettes that float above the street and light up at nighttime. One of the most notable natural inspirations to this arts district is the water stream painted on the floor, following the path of an actual stream that once flowed through Jalan Alor. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like Kuala Lumpur’s City Hall has released the names of the artists that designed and/or worked on this transformation. Perhaps this was not an oversight but rather by design, to emphasize the anonymous, self-less ideal of projects meant for the greater good.  While the jalans have been beautified, they are still back alleys in a major city’s tourist district, so take the usual caution when wandering through them, especially at night. The most-decorated alleyways are Jalans Alor, Berangan, Changkat, Rembia and Tengkat Tong Shin, but many other murals can be found in Bukit Bintang.",street art public art roads murals art

Although the Cat Museum is a mix of serious historical exhibits along with kitsch you might find in a cheap Chinatown bodega, it takes its work analyzing the history of cats very seriously. For centuries, Southeast Asia has had a history with cats, documented in great detail at the Cat Museum. Interestingly enough, Kuching actually means cat, making the location of the museum all the more apt. Besides stuffed cats, porcelain cats, and gigantic fang doorways, the museum also recounts bizarre superstitions around the animal, like nearly drowning a cat in order to bring rain. Outside of superstitious near-cat abuse, cat lovers should take solace in some of the more approachable exhibits, like Felis Badia, the rarest cat in the world, of which the museum is in possession of the only stuffed specimen.

15,Snake Island of Borneo,"Kuala Penyu, Malaysia",This tiny island in the South China Sea is crawling with venomous sea snakes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snake-island-of-borneo,"Pulau Tiga Park encompasses 158 square kilometers of open ocean containing three islands that were formed by mud volcano eruptions in the late 19th century. While the largest island (Tiga) is known for its natural volcanic mud baths, the smallest island (Kalampunian Damit) boasts an attraction that is far less relaxing but perhaps a bit more fascinating: lots and lots of deadly snakes. An isolated rock covered with tall silver Pisonia trees, the calm pale surroundings of Kalampunian Damit — also known as Snake Island — stand in stark contrast to the community of wild serpents that call the island home. Known as yellow-lipped sea kraits or banded sea kraits, the venomous sea snakes spend their nights hunting deep waters for eels and small fish, returning to land by day to digest and get some sleep. Individual kraits tend to have one specific home island to which they return, forming a constant and fairly stable population. They also use their home base as a breeding ground, meaning Kalampunian Damit tends to be particularly snakey during mating season. While banded sea kraits are considerably more poisonous than cobras, they are also fairly reclusive and non-aggressive and bite humans only in rare occasions where they are harassed or trod upon — which can admittedly be easy to do on a tiny island full of snakes, but as long as visitors watch their step they are in little danger. Being somewhat off the beaten path, Pulau Tiga Park sees few visitors, and is most famous for being the shooting location of the first season of Survivor.

However, the gorgeous place of worship has a unique catch: It’s filled with live pit vipers. The Snake Temple (officially known as Hock Hin Keong or Cheng Hoon Giam) was built in the mid-19th century to honor Chor Soo Kong, also known as Qingshui, a Buddhist monk and healer born in China during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The legend holds that during his lifetime, Chor Soo Kong sometimes offered shelter to local jungle snakes. After the temple was erected in his honor, it’s said snakes began showing up there of their own accord. Snakes aside, the temple is a beautiful piece of architecture. In its earliest years it was a simple attap structure, a traditional housing style found in the rural villages of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. But after decades of improvements and several major renovations, it has blossomed into a magnificent structure, featuring intricate detailing on the doors and rafter beams. The main temple opens into a courtyard, where the Shrine Hall of Kuan Yin is located, allowing visitors to marvel at the beautiful plants that populate the garden. Follow the pathway and you will arrive at the “snake pool,” where snakes recline on trees among leafy green branches, either basking in the sun or taking refuge in the shade. The snakes are thought to be kept docile thanks to incense being constantly burned. Locals will also tell you that many of the snakes in question, which are Wagler’s pit vipers and green tree snakes, have been de-venomed. Still, you’ll want keep your hands and feet to yourself at all times, and look around before you sit. It’s not recommended to bring small children, but the temple is a tranquil spot and they claim that no one has ever been bitten.  The temple is located about a 25-minute drive from downtown Penang, so either get a taxi, or catch the free shuttle bus. There is not much else around the temple, so consider trying to fit this in before or after the airport. On your way to the courtyard, you can also visit the exhibition next to the temple, which includes pythons and cobras. While entry to the temple is free, you do have to pay for a photo opportunity with these snakes. This is completely optional.",religious parks snakes temples

Nepenthes rajah is the largest of the pitcher plants, and it’s also the largest carnivorous plant in the world, sometimes referred to as the “king of the pitcher plants.” It is essentially a trap filled with up to three and half liters of water and two and a half liters of digestive fluid. It is evolved to lure insects to it, and when the insects fall in they are unable to escape and are digested by the plant. While insects, particularly ants, are by far the main staple of the Giant Malaysian Pitcher Plant (aka the Rajah Brooke’s Pitcher Plant, aka the King of Nepenthes, aka Nepenthes rajah), occasionally the large plants catch bigger prey. On a number of occasions rats have been found half-digested inside the pitchers, and other small vertebrates such as small birds, lizards, and frogs occasionally fall victim to the plants as well. This and one other pitcher plant, the N. rafflesiana, are the only plants known to catch mammalian prey. Among other unusual traits of the plant is a peculiar relationship with local shrews, one that may in fact be the origin of their large size. The plants have evolved to entice and attract tree shrews. The shape and size of the pitcher plants forces the shrews — who want to mark their feeding territory — to defecate directly into the plants’ cups, providing them with valuable nitrogen. And while it is rare for the plants to catch rats and mice, shrews poop in them all the time. This beneficial relationship between the pitcher plants and small mammals depositing feces into them may in fact be a driving factor behind the evolution of these the largest pitcher plants.",carnivorous plants horticulture plants

The white sandy beaches attract visitors from Malaysia’s mainland, and it’s a snorkelling, fishing, windsurfing, canoeing and jungle trekking destination. It is also said to have been an old pirate hideout. Look for lesser known treasures as you follow the trail that winds its way around the island through a number of lost beaches. On the northwest side of the island is an abandoned resort. The bar and bungalows are still in place, worn and weathered from their lack of use. Because of the island’s diminutive size, both the modern amenities and the deserted remains of a resort long gone can be discovered all on foot.

Founded in 2008 by former journalist Mohamad Norawi, this farm-café offers desserts and drinks made with vanilla beans grown and harvested on-site. Vanilla farms are rare in Malaysia, but Norawi is on a mission to change that. The farm, which supplies vanilla beans to restaurants throughout Kuala Lumpur, has quickly become a popular local and tourist attraction. Visitors can ride ATVs to tour the farm, learn about the harvesting season, and view the rows of vanilla orchid canopies. The tour ends at the farm’s café. Try the freshly churned vanilla bean ice cream or a vanilla bean root beer float. There’s also various waffles and pastries topped with—you guessed it—vanilla bean whipped cream.

25,B-24 Liberator Wreck at Gunung Telapak Buruk,"Kuala Klawang, Malaysia","The remains of this RAF plane and its crew were lost for decades, nearly engulfed by the Malaysian jungle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/b24-liberator-wreck-gunung-telapak-buruk,"On a rainforested mountaintop in Malaysia, not far from Kuala Lumpur, lies the wreckage of a Royal Air Force B-24 Liberator. World War II had ended only a few days before the British aircraft disappeared, lost while dropping supplies for resistance fighters in the remote jungles of Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. It was more than a thousand miles from its base in the Cocos Islands. Less than a week after the surrender of Japan, a crew of eight was sent on a mission to the Malay Peninsula to drop supplies, search for POW camps, and perhaps to even drop leaflets announcing the end of the War. There was no distress signal, no indication of trouble—but the plane disappeared, thought to have gone down in the ocean. Forty six years later, a remote wreckage site was reported by local Orang Asli tribesmen. The wreck may have first been spotted in the 1950s, but those reports are sketchy and, if true, were never acted on. (At the time, fear of an ambush by Communist insurgents may have been a factor.) When the locals came to the authorities in 1991, it was thought the plane might be the missing RAF tail# KL654/R, but expeditions to examine the site didn’t begin until 2006. In 2009, British and Malaysian volunteers excavated the area, uncovering the remains and some personal effects of the eight-man crew. In 2012 they were laid to rest at a special ceremony at the Cheras War Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur. The wreck, while spread over a large area, is well preserved, including sections of the wings, the fuselage, the engine, and even some faint markings. Although located in thick virgin jungle, it’s a popular destination for hiking groups. There is abundant wildlife, including siamang gibbons, and—although the species has been declared extinct on the Peninsula—Sumatran rhinos have been rumored to check the site out too. The wreck is located on the mountain called Gunung Telapak Buruk, about an hour’s drive south of Kuala Lumpur. There are two hiking routes to the wreck, the northern route is shorter, but requires a four wheel drive to get to the trail head (this is the position marked here). The southern route is longer and more challenging – about a 20 kilometre round trip through rugged terrain crossing Gunung Berembun, and the trail starts near the village of Kampung Pantai Baharu. There are several hiking groups that arrange visits to the site, and the trail itself, once located, is well marked and regularly used.",crash site aircraft world war ii military
26,Cheong Fatt Tze's Blue Mansion,"George Town, Malaysia","Once the private home of China’s most legendary tycoon, getting inside this stunning mansion no longer requires an elite pedigree or acts of daring.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cheong-fatt-tze-blue-mansion,"In the 1880s, with a career in full ascent, diplomat and merchant Cheong Fatt Tze (aka “the Rockefeller of the East”) took a political appointment in Penang and built a home that continues to put all others in George Town to shame. The “Blue Mansion,” as it’s known today, has 38 rooms, hundreds of windows, seven staircases (one imported from Scotland), five courtyards, porches lined with cast iron detailing so fine that it resembles lace, and gables inlaid with bright porcelain mosaics. Its architecture is most unique for the period, in that it bucked the trend of looking to the Anglo-Indian style, looking to the Southern Chinese courtyard homes of the Su Chow dynasty as touchstones instead. Again, in choosing a color to diffuse Penang’s soporific heat, Cheong Fatt Tze picked his heritage over what was popular at the time; blue prevailed, as white is traditionally the color of death in Chinese culture. Cheong Fatt Tze lived in the house when business kept him in Penang, though he was often called away. The Blue Mansion became more of a family property, and it was noted that his seventh wife was particularly fond of the home. Regardless, when Cheong passed away in 1916, his will specified that the home remain a family property, and a sum of money was set aside to maintain it in perpetuity. It took very little time before these funds were mismanaged. The building fell quickly into disrepair, leading to squatters taking up residencies in some of the mansion’s more remote, disused wings. With the death of Cheong Fatt Tze’s last son in 1989, the crumbling property was put on the market. A group of well-intentioned locals beat out bigger development firms to secure its purchase and restoration on the building began shortly thereafter. Today the mansion, restored to its former glory, has been reborn as a UNESCO-recognized hybrid museum-bed and breakfast. 16 rooms are available to stay in overnight, while historical tours of the manor are offered to guests and the general public alike three times daily, making a magnate’s opulence accessible to all.",mansions hotels museums
27,National Textile Museum,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",An exploration of Malaysian heritage through the lens of traditional textiles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-textile-museum,"Housed within a striking landmark building designed in the Indo-Saracenic Revival style, the National Textile Museum in Kuala Lumpur is dedicated to the very fabric of Malaysian culture. Behind the pink-striped exterior of the former Federated Malay States Railways building, the museum is comprised of four galleries spread across two floors. They trace the history and significance of Malaysian textiles through the exhibition of traditional modes of dress, and by charting the evolution of textile-producing technology. The Pohon Budi or “Tree of Life” gallery introduces visitors to the ancient origins of textile production and trade. This gallery spotlights prominent Malaysian textiles such as the songket (a silk sarong interwoven with gilded thread), keringkam (a kind of gold embroidery typically seen in headscarves worn by women in the Malaysian state of Sarawak), pua kumbu (a colorful, patterned cloth reserved for Iban ceremonies), and linangkit (a kind of decorative embroidery that adorns the skirts of Lotud women). The gallery also maps out the tools and techniques used to create these textiles. The Pelangi Gallery is named after a multicolored cloth worn by various ethnic groups across Malaysia. This rainbow fabric is said to symbolize Malaysia’s colorful heritage, and showcases the ways in which different communities style and adorn this national textile. The Teluk Berantai Gallery refers to the floral motif featured in Malaysian songkets. The pattern is associated with Malaysian unity, though different groups have cultivated their own aesthetic versions of it; from tekatan (embroidered gold on raised velvet) to kain limar (a silk panel draped over the songket). Lastly, the Ratna Sari Gallery focuses on the exquisite finishing touches that complement Malaysian costumes: jewels and accessories made from gems, metals, and gold. The term Ratna Sari refers specifically to the traditional jewelry crafted by Malaysian artisans of yore, and which incorporates Chinese, Indian, and Malay details.  The National Textile Museum is open every day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is 5 Malaysian ringgits (about $1.20) for foreigners. The museum is about a 15-minute walk from the Masjid Jamek station in Kuala Lumpur.",textiles crafts culture museums
28,Penang Jewish Cemetery,"George Town, Malaysia",The oldest Jewish cemetery in Southeast Asia is a monument to a disappearing community.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/penang-jewish-cemetery,"Tucked away behind high, unkempt walls on the side of a busy road that feels worlds away from the charming shophouse streets of tourist-friendly George Town, it’s easy to miss the Jewish Cemetery (despite the name printed in English on its gates). If the gates appear locked, a visitor need only knock or shout; the proprietor will soon be out to open them, and give you a brief tour, from the oldest grave, erected in 1835, to the newest, erected in 2011. Upon first entering the cemetery, the graves—formed of long, low triangles or domes similar to ossuaries found in the Middle East—appear to be unmarked. But if you walk around to the other side you can find inscriptions. Most are in Hebrew, a few accompanied by English translations. Nearly all are hidden in small alcoves on the side of the casket-like grave stones, facing away from the entrance. A few small glass pebbles and several stones mark the graves, demonstrating that the memory of those interred here lives on, despite the fact that (according to the proprietor) the last ethnic Jew on the island of Penang is already lying here, a man who died in 2011. When asked if there were still any jews living in Penang, he replies laconically, “There used to be many—but now there are none at all.” The absence may be keenly felt by the traveller to this lonely alcove. Checking the guestbook, it seems that the cemetery often goes days or weeks without a single guest. Those that have made the pilgrimage leave names and countries from all over the world. There are even a few entires in Hebrew. Sadly, Penang’s only synagogue, dating back to 1929, was unable to support a minyan (a group of 10 or more adult Jews, traditionally men), and closed down in 1976, leaving the Jewish Cemetery as the last trace of the community. Even the street it stands next to, once called Yahudi Road, or “Jewish Street,” has since been renamed Jalan Zainal Abidin. The only entrance is via the gate on the main, northern stretch of Jalan Zainal Abidin road. The parts that border the alleyway of the same name to the south are made inaccessible by high stone walls.",judaism jewish graves gravestones cemeteries
29,Sarawak Museum,"Kuching, Malaysia",The oldest museum in Borneo is a cornucopia of rare taxidermy and human skulls.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarawak-museum,"Contained in Borneo’s oldest museum is not only some rare historical taxidermy, but also an exhibit that remembers the historic (if barbaric) culture of headhunting. In 1891, the second White Rajah of Sarawak, Charles Brooke began construction works on what would be the oldest museum in Borneo. This plan came after some nudging from his friend and famous British naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, who had been exploring the Malay Archipelago, collecting specimens for study at the time. The Victorian period architecture, designed after a Normandy town hall, survived through the Japanese Occupation in Malaya (1941 – 1945) during World War II. It had the good fortune to fall under the protection of a Japanese officer, which is why the museum suffered very little damage and looting. A lucky thing too because the natural history collection housed in this museum is regarded as one of the finest in Southeast Asia, which dates back to the dynastic English monarchy of the Brooke family (1841 – 1946). On the ground floor of the Sarawak Museum, you’ll find taxidermied exhibits frozen in time in their wood and glass display case, ever watchful of the many visitors who had walked through the Natural History gallery for decades. They had seen the world changed, although the exhibits themselves remained the same, if not somewhat disintegrating a little as time goes by. A great deal of the collection comes from the Brooke Era, where the taxidermy procedures had been done not in Sarawak, but all the way in Britain. This preservation took place in the 1800s, so delivery by sea took about three months each way yet the fragile shipments remarkably managed to arrive at their destinations without harm. Case in point would be the Orangutan exhibit. As the story goes, the first Rajah of Sarawak, James Brooke, shot two Orangutans during a hunt. He had both packed in ice, shipped to Britain to be taxidermied and mounted, and later shipped back to the Sarawak Museum. Today, this exhibit, along with others from that era have remained as they were in the Natural History gallery. This gallery is home to various taxidermied specimens including primates, avians, felines, and rodents found in Borneo. The natural history collection is not the sole appeal of the Sarawak Museum however. The first floor features ethnographical artifacts of indigenous peoples of Sarawak, including a wide collection of traditional ceremonial masks from different tribal groups. Among the local culture, carved wooden masks are worn by the spirit doctors of a tribe and different masks serve different ritualistic purposes. They can be used to celebrate a good harvest or for spiritual ceremonies like exorcising evil spirits from a victim’s body. The museum’s collection contains mainly masks from the Iban, a tribal subgroup of the Dayak people of Sarawak. Ceremonial masks come with varied expressions, and some are even implanted with actual human hair as facial hair. Also on the first floor is a model longhouse built to depict the traditional living spaces of the historic Dayak people. In previous eras, the Dayaks practiced headhunting, and human skulls would be preserved and installed in longhouses, believing that the trophies would bring a good harvest and fertility to the community. The replica community hut is adorned with its own human skulls. Of course, the practice of headhunting has long been eradicated since the days of the White Rajahs. No need to lose your head worrying over it when visiting Sarawak today. However, maintenance of the heads is not to be taken lightly, even to this day, for as long as human skulls are present in a longhouse there are rules and rituals to follow. The heads need regular food offerings and a constant fire lit beneath them. Failure to do so would anger the spirits of the heads, and this only spells bad omens to the inhabitants of the longhouse. Just to be safe, don’t mess with the heads. Update as of February 2020: The museum is closed for renovations, but there are plans for it to reopen sometime in 2020.",taxidermy museums and collections museums

The Peranakan, also known as the Baba Nyonya in Penang, are largely the descendants of Chinese men who came to the Malay archipelago centuries ago and married local Malay women. During the colonial era, they mainly engaged in trade and business, making them extremely wealthy in both currency and exposure to other cultures. Their opulent homes speak to the wealth and high status they enjoyed. The Pinang Peranakan Mansion is a particularly exquisite example of their culture, which has begun to decline in Malaysia and Singapore. The Pinang Peranakan Mansion belonged to Chung Keng Quee, who was among the wealthiest residents of Penang in the late 1800s. His fortune was derived mainly from his businesses in mining. His mansion was built in a style unique within this part of the world, as it’s an eclectic mix of Chinese and European design elements. Today, it serves as a museum dedicated to Peranakan culture. Inside, a large collection of furniture, silverware, dresses, decorations, collectibles, and appliances is kept on display. This collection provides fascinating insight into the culture’s lifestyles and customs.  It's open Monday through Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The admission fee is 20RM (~$5 USD).

32,Kundasang War Memorial,"Ranau, Malaysia",Four distinctly unique gardens commemorate the POWs who lost their lives during the Sandakan Death Marches of 1945.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kundasang-war-memorial,"“I’m dreaming of Australia, the land we left behind…” These are the despairing words carved into black stone at the Kundasang War Memorial and Gardens, one of the first memorials created to remember the victims of the Sandakan Death Marches of 1945. Over 1,000 Australian and British Prisoners of War perished in Sandakan, Malaysia during the three death marches from the Sandakan POW Camp to Ranau, Malaysia during World War II. A mere 6 men survived, all of them Australian soldiers who had escaped. The memorial was built to commemorate both the victims of the marches themselves and the people of North Borneo who risked or lost their lives to help the POWs by hiding escapees from the Japanese and feeding them until the war ended. The death marches are considered to be the single most atrocious calamity to ever be endured by Australian servicemen during the World War, and three Japanese commanders were eventually tried and put to death for the war crimes. In 1962 the memorial was erected, and it’s a calm and peaceful place to visit despite being located behind a bustling farmers’ market. The gardens are made up of four sections, one for each distinctly different homeland and culture of those who lost their lives, and one for contemplation. There is an Australian Garden, an English Garden, a Borneo Garden, and a Contemplation Garden and Pool. If you visit the memorial you are welcome to watch a video and learn more about the death marches, but if you don’t have the stomach for it you can simply smell the roses of the English Garden, admire the orchids of Borneo, run your fingers across the smooth white pebbles of Kundasang in the Australian Garden, or go to the pool and contemplate the sacrifices, sadness, and all-too-human fallacies of war. Kundasang is located 90 km, approximately 2 hours by automobile, from the capital of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu. Visitors may take a bus from the Jalan Padang Bus Terminal to Kundasang or Ranau for approximately RM17.00 per person. A taxi from the Ranau Taxi Stand (located beside the Merdeka Field) or from a hotel should cost around RM160.00 to RM300.00 per taxi.

Worries simply drift away into a calmer state of being. This Buddhist ethos is perfectly portrayed in Wat Chaiya Mangkalaram, a temple with a giant reclining Buddha. Unlike monuments to other spiritual figures, the Buddha is not supposed to create feelings of sadness or loss. Instead, the 100-foot-long golden Buddha is meant to inspire, showing all of those who follow in his path the supreme happiness achieved from nirvana. Sprawled across the entire temple, the Buddha is slightly smiling and natural light shimmers off of his gold and white finish. Wat Chaiya Mangkalaram is actually a Thai temple, and is not directly connected to Malaysia in origin. The temple was built in 1845 by a Thai monk, and has been a location of serious Buddhist devotion since. Many of the most devoted to the temple have had their ashes placed in niches behind the massive Buddha statue.

Opened in 2005, Ithaa (which means ‘mother of pearl’ in Dhivehi, the local language) charges a premium for its meals, but they might cost less than one would expect for an underwater dinner. They start in price at about $120 US for lunch for hotel guests. The restaurant serves contemporary fusion Maldivian cuisine with Western and Asian influences. Advance reservations are necessary. Designed by the Kuala Lumpur National Science Center, the building qualifies as the world’s largest aquarium tunnel. After completion in 2004, Ithaa was taken to the Maldives on the back of an ocean-going barge. It took 16 days to arrive.

Huge quantities of plankton flow through it, which enables the whole food chain to thrive. More than 250 types of corals are found in the Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve, sustaining about 1,200 species of fish. Baa Atoll refers to three distinct atolls that form a wider ring of islands covering a total area of 345,206 acres (139,700 hectares). Of the 75 islands in the Baa Atoll, 13 are inhabited by Maldivians, some are resort islands (where there is one tourist resort on the whole island), and the rest are uninhabited. The waters of the atoll vary in depth from 98 to 263 feet (30 to 80 meters), whereas around the atoll, the ocean plummets to more than 250 metres in depth. Look in the water, and you’ll likely spot parrot-fish, butterfly-fish, angel-fish, clown-fish, wrasses, marine turtles, moray eels, manta rays, groupers, whale sharks, and dolphins. Some threatened and endangered species found in the waters of the atoll include green turtles, hawksbill turtles, Napoleon wrasses, and tawny nurse sharks. The astonishing degree of biodiversity of the Baa Atoll extends also to above-water flora and fauna. Mangroves are present on virtually all islands, and among the most common animals are several types of lizards, skinks and geckos, fruit bats, frigate birds, and herons. The government has made a commitment to environmental protection, with a particular emphasis on recycling, which has led to the export of recyclable waste becoming a thriving business in recent years, second only to the export of fish.  Baa Atoll can be reached by ferry boats from Malé. Alternatively, there are frequent daily flights between the Island of Dharavandhoo and Malé. From Dharavandhoo, other islands can be reached by boat. The GPS coordinates for this place entry lead to the Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve Office on the island of Eydhafushi. Scuba diving indubitably increases the number of marine creatures you may encounter but it is not a requirement. Snorkeling in waters up to 16 feet (five meters) in depth is sufficient to see more species than you can name. The environmental impact of your visit also depends on the type of accommodation you choose. In this regard, islands develop their own waste management system that must comply with local regulations, which emphasise self-reliance and sustainability. Although official inspections are rare, some islands have taken environmentally friendly practices seriously. Some research before visiting is required, but it is possible to visit the Baa Atoll with minimal environmental impact. As mentioned, some islands are entirely dedicated to tourism, with one resort being the only structure on the whole island. The range of these resorts can vary, from gaudy to luxurious. For a more authentic experience, accommodation can also be found on the islands inhabited by Maldivians. This imposes some restrictions, such as dressing modestly in the villages, no alcohol, and limited nightlife.",coral reefs biodiversity water nature
39,"Thilafushi: the ""Rubbish Island""","Malé, Maldives",The exorbitant price of paradise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thilasfushi-the-rubbish-island,"The Maldives island chain in the Indian Ocean is about as close as it gets to tropical bliss on Earth. The smooth white sand, tranquil blue water, and beautiful foliage annually attracts 750,000 visitors a year. But unbeknownst to most of these tourists, for decades the rubbish they produced - 3.5 kg per day - was being ditched on a floating, heaping pile of trash. In the beginning, Thilafushi was a lagoon composed of shallow coral reefs. In 1992, the Malé government decided to use the barrier island as the final destination for the enormous waste produced by their flourishing tourism industry. “Rubbish Island” as it was called, began receiving visitors in the form of massive refuse freighters, garbage excavators and migrant workers paid to handle the trash. For 20 some odd years, the man-made “island” was presented with approximately 330 tons of garbage a day, causing it to swell at a rate of one square meter every 24 hours. The newly-generated land was soon leased to entrepreneurs who used the island for various industrial activities. The island has of course suffered from the haphazard waste. The outrageous number of flies is a disgusting addition to the area, but isn’t the island’s biggest problem. Commercial activity along with indiscriminate dumping has brought an abundance of toxic materials to the lagoon - broken oil drums, asbestos, lead, and other noxious metals mix in with daily household garbage items creating a noxious sludge. There is little around the island that goes unpolluted as harmful substances seep into the water and smoke from burning waste floods the air. The government outlawed rubbish dumping on the island in 2011 after several freighters, impatient with the dumping process, jettisoned their loads directly into the sea. Garbage boats are reportedly now advised to shuttle their merchandise to India.",disaster areas islands
40,Dhigurashu Thun'di (Long Beach),"Dhigurah, Maldives","A narrow, serpentine spit of sand is constantly eroded and rebuilt by competing currents.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dhigurashu-thundi-long-beach-maldives,"Indian flying foxes—one of the largest bat species in the world—flit from one breadfruit tree to the next, their wings silent above the rhythm of the surf. Here on the island of Dhigurah, a narrow slice of sand and coral in the Maldives’ Alifu Dhaalu Atoll, about two hours by public speedboat from the capital of Malé, the ocean is always nearby. At its widest point, Dhigurah is only 300 meters across, though most of it is much narrower. Its slender shape—Dhigurah means “long island” in Dhivehi—is most dramatic at its southwest end, a sand spit that stretches for hundreds of meters between the atoll lagoon and the open Indian Ocean. Ocean and lagoon waves constantly compete to erode and rebuild the thin, serpentine sandbar, known as Dhigurashu Thun’di, or Long Beach. Yet the water on either side of the spit is surprisingly calm. It’s not unusual to see local children splashing in the waves while their parents set out a picnic nearby. About 600 people live on the island, and the spit is a popular destination for villagers at all times of day. A thin strip of tropical forest thick with palm and breadfruit trees offers shade from the midday sun. At sunset, sand and sky turn dramatic shades of red and orange as the lights of small fishing boats wink on in the gathering darkness. Just beyond the spit, waves crash together, hinting at the powerful forces in motion beneath the surface. Even then, at low tides on calm days, it’s theoretically possible to cross from the sand spit to another sandbar that leads to a small island, home to a luxury resort—though a no-trespassing sign warns you against doing so. The Maldives began welcoming tourists in 1972, and for most of that period, visiting meant flying into the capital of Malé and being whisked by chartered seaplane or private speedboat to a high-end resort island that was off-limits to locals. Since 2009, however, several “local islands,” dotted with guesthouses and small hotels, have opened to foreign tourists. On these islands, including Dhigurah, alcohol is banned and adhan, the Islamic call to prayer, echoes across the sand several times a day. Dhigurah is located close to several nearshore sites popular with whale sharks and manta rays year-round, drawing a growing number of foreigners eager to snorkel or dive with the animals. But Dhigurashu Thun’di remains a quiet, calm place of stunning beauty shared by locals and visitors alike, a slim line of white sand curving between a turquoise lagoon and the open ocean.  Dhigurashu Thun'di is accessible by foot from the island's village in about half an hour. Walking along the northwest-facing beach requires some wading. Reaching it via the southeast beach is not recommended due to the rocky coast and stronger currents. You can also reach the spit by following the island's ""Beach Trail,"" actually an unpaved road through the jungle. The road is used by villagers to access community gardens and the island's garbage collection site, so expect to yield to motorbikes and ""Cool Rides,"" a popular local vehicle that's half motorized tricycle, half mini-pickup. Unlike at the so-called ""Bikini Beach"" for tourists on the island's north side, modest attire is appropriate for Dhigurashu Thun'di, which is very popular with local families. Everyone visiting the Long Beach should be covered from shoulders and upper arms to knees.",waves bats beaches oceans islands
41,Dharavandhoo Fish Market,"Dharavandhoo, Maldives","When the sun sets, the customers arrive—but they’re not human.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dharavandhoo-fish-market,"A small, open-air concrete building sits beside a palm tree at the east edge of Dharavandhoo’s pocket-sized harbor. A sign announces it as the island’s fish market, but it’s nothing like the bustling trade halls of Tokyo’s Toyosu or Seattle’s touristy Pike Place. Here, no money changes hands, and the diverse customers take whatever they’re offered, no haggling necessary. “Reef sharks, stingrays, sometimes nurse sharks up to three meters long,” says Ahmed Mahzoom, listing the fish that gather in the water at the harbor wall’s base. Mahzoom works at one of the handful of modest hotels and guesthouses on the tiny island, which is part of the Maldives’ Baa Atoll and home to about 800 people. From May to November, Dharavandhoo is a hub for tourists eager to see massive gatherings of manta rays in nearby Hanifaru Bay. It’s also popular year-round with divers and snorkelers in search of octopuses, moray eels, turtles, and more. But at the Dharavandhoo Fish Market, the fish come to you. In late afternoon, families gather along the harbor wall behind the market building, often grandparents with teens and children in tow. They handline fish, unspooling line from around a repurposed plastic bottle and tossing baited hooks from the wall’s concrete edge. If something bites, the fisher brings the line in, quickly wrapping it around the bottle, while their assistant waits with a net. Groupers, jacks, and other meaty reef fish are kept, but slender cornetfish and smaller species get thrown back. As daylight fades, the fishers and their families carry buckets with their catch into the market building, a tidy place with rows of filleting stations, sinks, and pump bottles of hand sanitizer. Meanwhile, the fish market’s customers gather outside. The sandy bottom and bright harbor lights make it easy to see the arrivals: one, then two, then six stingrays on this night, circling patiently just below the surface. Cowtail stingrays and paler porcupine rays glide around and over each other in a slow ballet of patience as they wait for dinner. A heron, also interested in what’s on the menu, perches on a nearby jetty. As the fishers gut their catch and toss the remains back into the water, the rays take turns surfacing, snacking, and then circling back to the end of the line in hopes of more morsels. The stretch of water illuminated by the harbor lights turns into a synchronized swimming performance. Even when sharks show up, locals say it’s an orderly affair. Night falls as the fishers prep the last of the day’s catch and pack it up to take home. The final handful of tails and innards is thrown into the water and a waiting ray takes it with barely a ripple. As the families leave the fish market, so do the rays, swimming into the darker waters beyond the harbor’s glow.",marine fishing fish
42,Khustain Nuruu National Park,Mongolia,The grassy landscape is home to the world's last truly wild horses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khustain-nuruu-national-park,"One of the great comebacks of the 1990s took place not on the silver screen or the sports field, but in the grasslands of Mongolia. The takhi wild horses native to the grassy steppes had vanished from the wild in the 1970s, but as a result of various breeding programs, they slowly reappeared in their old stomping grounds, including their original home: the Khustain Nuruu national park. The takhi (officially named Przewalski’s horse after the Russian explorer who first spotted it), may be the world’s last truly wild horse. While most “wild” horses around the globe are domesticated horses gone feral, the Przewalski’s horse was never domesticated. Up until the 18th century, these short stocky horses freely roamed the steppes of Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russian Siberia. But then the numbers started dwindling. In 1967, the last herd of takhi was spotted and in 1969, the last individual horse. They were declared “extinct in the wild,” which remained the status quo for nearly 30 years. There were only 13 surviving takhi horses, kept in different zoos around the world. They were bred carefully, and the population slowly increased to more than 1,500 at which point they were reintroduced into the wild. The downside of this method is that the genetic pool of all the existing horses is limited. One of the places where the reintroduction took place in 1992 was the horse’s native habitat of Khustain Nuruu or Hustai National Park. A year later the park, which stretches across 50,000 hectares, was declared as a Specially Protected Area. Its key mission is to maintain and build a sustainable population of these rare creatures. Visitors to the park can now spot teams of dun-colored horses wandering around the dry grassy landscape. Although the star of Khustain Nuruu is indubitably the takhi, the park is also home to other species like the red deer, steppe gazelle, the Eurasian badger, grey wolves, and the Eurasian lynx.  Khustain National Park is located 60 miles west of Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian capital city. Public transport can drop the occasional visitor nearby the park, but a private car would certainly come in handy given the size of the park. Accommodation can be found inside the park itself, but several camps are scattered throughout the area.",wildlife sanctuaries horses national parks nature animals
43,Genghis Khan Statue Complex,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",Enormous statue of the Emperor of the Mongols.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/genghis-khan-equestrian-statue,"To most of the world, Genghis Khan is known as a brutal and savage dictator, whose campaigns of terror and wholesale massacre of civilian populations may have resulted in the deaths of up to forty million people. But to the people of Mongolia, he is revered as a national hero, ruling over the largest contiguous empire in history and establishing the Mongols as a political and cultural force. Despite being represented on dozens of statues and appearing on everything from bottles of liquor to cigarette packets, it seems that the public’s appetite for more has not yet waned. In 2008, a giant statue of Khan riding a horse was erected fifty-four kilometers from the capital Ulaanbaatar. At forty meters high, it is the world’s largest equestrian statue and stands more than double the height of the previous record holder in Uruguay. Made from two hundred and fifty tons of stainless steel, it reputedly cost $4.1 million to construct. At the base of the statue, visitors can visit an archaeological museum, try on traditional Mongolian costumes, tour the numerous portraits of the Khan lineage, or try the cuisine at the restaurant on the second floor before taking an elevator to to the top of the horse’s head, where they are greeted with a panoramic view over the surrounding landscape. The foundation building, designed to look like European Gothic style architecture, symbolizes that Genghis Khan is standing on Europe after his successful military campaigns, and he is returning East, his home country. If you stretch your eyes to the East, you will see a small statue of his mother greeting him.  The statue is located 54 kilometers from the capital city Ulaanbaatar. This place is also famous for its photo spot with wild birds. Visitors can take a picture with a golden eagle or vulture on their hand.",monuments statues
44,Erdene Zuu,"Kharkhorin, Mongolia","The oldest Buddhist monastery in Mongolia has survived centuries of invasions, political shifts, and religious purges.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erdene-zuu,"The establishment of Erdene Zuu dates at least to 1585, and some posit it goes back much further, as far as the 8th century. It is the oldest surviving Buddhist monastery in Mongolia. The name translated means “100 Treasures,” a nod to the number of original temples and the chain of stupas (mounded reliquaries) that form the exterior walls of the sacred site. Tangled in its legacy, there are the scars of centuries of fighting across those sacred walls. The history of Erdene Zuu is a mix of invasions, religious purges, political shifts, and outright murder. Damaged and dismantled in 1688 during a conflict between Dzungars (a confederation of Mongolian tribes) and Khalkha Mongols (historically ruled by the Khans), what remained of the monastery was reassembled in the 18th century. Again, in 1939, the order suffered a blow at the hands of Khorloogiin Choibalsan, the Communist leader of Mongolia, who ordered the destruction of scores of temples and the slaughter of thousands of monks throughout the country. All that remained of Erdene Zuu were three temples and a small order, with nearly one hundred structures destroyed and an estimated one thousand members either murdered or imprisoned. It was either sheer luck or the twisted wisdom of Stalin that saved the site from total destruction, kept as a token of “religious tolerance” to be put on display for international visitors, including U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace during a trip in the late 1940s. Intervention by the Soviet leader convinced the Mongolian regime to spare the monastery, a move motivated less by goodwill than by political pretense. But tolerance under Stalin and Khorloogiin Choibalsan only went so far, and the monastery was forced to convert into a museum. It remained in this religious limbo until the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviets and reversion of the site to the lamas. It still wears both hats today, and the wall of 108 stupas that surround the compound, clearly visible from a mile away, are in a good state of repair. Inside there are several temples and additional stupas, the oldest dating to 1799.  One particular area of historic destruction by the Communists is cordoned off, but its foundations are still visible. There are plans to rebuild, but work has yet to begin. Erdene Zuu, after so many centuries of sheer will to survive, will get that work done. Part of the Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape World Heritage Site, the monastery is in central Mongolia, about a quarter mile northeast of the center of Kharkhorin.",buddhism temples religion sacred spaces museums

Seeming to promote good relations between the two states, the monument was actually created by the Soviet Union to depict just how much they had done for the lowly eastern communist state. Located on a hill south of the city, the monument features a circular memorial painting that depicts scenes of friendship between the peoples of the USSR and Mongolia. Ostensibly built to commemorate Soviet soldiers in World War II, the sprawling mural also illustrates the defeat of the Japanese in 1939, which brought Mongolia into the Soviet sphere of influence. Of course the victory over Nazi Germany, a battle that subsumed Mongolian troops into the Red Army, is also prominently featured. In 2003, a tank memorial, featuring a Soviet tank from a brigade paid for by the Mongolian people, was moved to the foot of the hill. The tank memorial includes a map showing the route the brigade took from Moscow in 1943 for participation in the fall of Berlin in 1945. From the bottom of the hill, visitors can choose to make the climb of more than five hundred steps in order to reach the monument and mural. Those who make the climb receive a reward of a spectacular panoramic view of Ulaanbaatar, the surrounding mountains and the Tuul river.

46,International Intellectual and Puzzle Museum,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia","An institution dedicated to curiosity, logic, riddles, and Mongolia's long history of puzzles.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/international-intellectual-museum,"Mongolia has a history of puzzle-crafting, and has created some of the world’s most difficult puzzles and chess sets. Shatar, a Mongolian version of chess, dates back to the Middle Ages, while more modern burr puzzles (made from interlocking pieces of wood) can be traced back throughout the 1900s. Mongolia’s enigmatic history is honored at the International Intellectual Puzzle Museum, or the IQ Museum for short. The museum is the creation of Tumen Ulzii, who was born to nomadic herders and would have followed that path had he not fallen in love with logic puzzles at an early age. His father gave him a six-piece burr puzzle with one piece missing. After he solved the problem of the missing piece he began creating his own puzzles, eventually founding a company to manufacture logic games for the youth of Mongolia and a museum to showcase puzzle and logic history. Ulzii’s work has not gone unrecognized—he has been awarded the prizes for “Best Inventor in Mongolia” and “Meritorious Person of Culture.” The museum displays some puzzles created by Ulzii himself, as well as rare and precious puzzles from around the world. Over 5,000 toys, puzzles, and games are on view, most of which visitors are invited to fiddle with. Ulzii’s inventions are usually wooden, the pieces carved into whimsical Disney characters and animals of the zodiac. Some even depict figures from Mongolian history, like Genghis Khan. The simplest are the traditional six-piece models, but some puzzles in the museum include as many as 350 pieces. There are also various puzzles made from gold, precious stones, and silver. One turtle-shaped puzzle offers a prize of $100,000 if solved within a specific timeframe. In the museum’s three decades of operation, no one has ever solved it. Mongolian chess, another of Ulzii’s passions, is also featured in the IQ Museum’s exhibits. Masterful woodcarving, a skill essential to crafting the intricate puzzles, is also exhibited at the museum in the traditional furniture which decorates the space. The purpose of the museum is not just to catalogue the history of puzzles in Mongolia, but to remind visitors that curiosity and play are an important part of training the brain. Visitors to the museum are guided by a docent who performs magic tricks, watches you struggle with the puzzles, and reveals their solutions to you in a matter of seconds. No photos are allowed inside the museum apart from one display at the end. Open your mind to the challenge of games and puzzles and enjoy the fun and beautiful craftsmanship of the exhibits.",chess puzzles games collections museums and collections museums
47,Khamriin Khiid,"Urgun, Mongolia",Mongolian Buddhists believe this monastery in the Gobi desert to be the center of the world's spiritual energy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khamriin-khiid,"According to Mongolian Buddhism, a spot in the middle of the Gobi desert is where the strongest spiritual energy in the world converges. To mark the location, the monastery complex was built in the 19th century, Khamriin Khiid. The original Khamriin Khiid monastery was founded in 1820 by Danzanravjaa, known as the Terrible Noble Saint of the Gobi, who observed the location’s tremendous energy. At its peak, the monastery housed up to 500 monks, and included more than 80 temples within the complex. Danzanravjaa was a great scholar and practitioner of the arts, as well as a social reformer. He set up a theater at the monastery for people to develop their singing and acting skills, and a public school, which encouraged education for both men and women. The lively and productive monastery was destroyed in 1937, in the wake of the Communist purge against religions, and Khamriin Khiid in its current form was reconstructed in 1990. Today, hundreds of pilgrims visit the site every day at dawn to benefit from the spiritual energy that is believed to radiate as a new day is born. Shambala, the centerpiece of the complex, is surrounded by 108 stupas, encircling other holy monuments and temples, the most prominent of which has a large pair of eyes staring at visitors. The enclosed space is said to be warmer due to the energy that emanates from Shambala, and it is not uncommon to see pilgrims taking off their shoes to better absorb the energy. Another form of worship is the throwing of rice, millet, milk and vodka on monuments. Other visitors walk around singing a song composed for Khamriin Khiid. Outside the enclosure are the series of caves where Danzanravjaa and other monks meditated for 108 days, two huge breast-shaped mounds covered in milk, a wind-activated bell, and the actual monastery.",energy monks buddhism deserts religion sacred spaces history
48,The Mother Tree,"Shammar, Mongolia",This spiritual landmark for practicers of Shamanism is drenched in milk and vodka and covered in blue scarves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mother-tree-shammar-mongolia,"Although Buddhism is the most widespread practiced religion in Mongolia, Shamanism is alive and well. Often, the two religions blend into one, and landmarks throughout Mongolia testify to this. The Eej Mod or “Mother Tree” in Shaamar is one stand-out example. Its fame spread beyond Mongolia and worshippers from Japan, Korea, and China  come from afar to pay homage to the Mother Tree. Those who practice Shamanism believe that shamans communicate between the human and spiritual worlds, and the Mother Tree became seen as a gateway to the spirits after it was struck by lightning. Now worshipers will travel to the tree to make an offering in hopes of having their prayers answered. Until 2015, the Mother Tree was an actual tree, around which a ger (aka yurt) had been built. Following a practice that thousands of others had engaged in before, one worshipper in 2015 lit an incense stick by the tree, but this time the tree caught fire, and it was all but destroyed.  The stump was salvaged from the fire and placed in the outside compound. Today, the ger is still in its place, and the ground where the Mother Tree once grew is the object of people’s veneration. The stump, alongside a number of nearby trees, is shrouded in ceremonial scarves, mostly blue, and drenched in milk and vodka. The fence around the compound is “fortified” by tea bricks.  In an adjacent compound, another tree has been elevated to the status of Holy Tree in recent years by an eminent Mongolia shaman. Along the main road running through Shaamar, there is a sign saying Eej Mod (in Mongolian script) pointing left (heading north). There is no well defined road, but tracks going off road are visible at the sign. The Mother Tree is a couple of kilometres along those tracks.",trees religion plants sacred spaces
49,Flaming Cliffs,"Bulgan, Mongolia",Dinosaur eggs were first discovered at these fiery red cliffs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flaming-cliffs,"In the evening, these desert cliffs glow with a fiery red light that seems to mimic the radiance of the setting sun. The cliffs are best seen from below or across the escarpment. But no matter where you stand or what time you visit, you can still witness the breathtaking magnitude and raw beauty of the place come to life. The local geology is just as captivating as the cliff’s blazing light show. This landscape within the Gobi Desert is arguably among the most important sites for dinosaur fossil hunters, and research around the cliffs has proven to be particularly fruitful. Dinosaur eggs were first discovered in this area in the 1920s, and a fossil of a Protoceratops and a Velociraptor locked in a fight were unearthed in the 1970s. To date, paleontologists are finding important fossils in the surrounding area. The Flaming Cliffs are a prime example of what’s known as a Djadochta Formation, layers of sand and calcareous matter. Even by geological standards, the cliffs are an ancient formation, with the best estimates clocking their birth at 71 to 75 million years ago. Another fun fact: The Flaming Cliffs are also called Bayanzag, which means “rich in saxaul,” one of the few plants that can survive the extremes of the Gobi: extremely cold, extremely hot, and extremely arid. Saxaul is a thorny shrub that is better left untouched. Camels, however, seem partial to it. The roughly 60-mile dirt track from Dalanzadgad is compacted rocky desert that makes for an exceptionally smooth ride. Signs, however, are few and far between. It is best to go with someone who knows the area or to ask for directions along the way, even if you think you’re on the right track. Although it’s not uninhabited, it is still a desert, and the risks that this implies should not be underestimated.",cliffs dinosaurs fossils rock formations deserts geology animals
50,Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",An exceptional assortment of fossils recovered from private collections.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-museum-of-mongolian-dinosaurs,"The Gobi Desert on the Mongolia-China border is a beautifully desolate area, but millions of years ago, when dinosaurs roamed, it teemed with life. That combination makes it a world-class source of fossils. It’s the type of place where you can find protoceratops skulls, dinosaur eggs, and a full skeleton of Tarbosaurus bataar, all of which are on display at this museum in Ulaanbaatar. While the museum itself is a bit shabby and rarely appears on Ulaanbaatar itineraries, it holds some real paleontological gems within its walls. Its openly mounted skeletons of original fossils rather than cast copies are a rare sight to behold. The first sight past the ticket booth is a showstopper: the dramatically lit Tarbosaurus bataar skeleton, which closely resembles a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the famed North American predator. Another room (of three) contains a full skeleton of an oviraptor, which stood at a height equivalent to a human’s chest. Perhaps even more incredible than its collection is the museum’s origin story. While Mongolia is a treasure trove of dinosaur fossils, the country’s riches have long been smuggled beyond its borders. This was the case for the museum’s entire collection, until foreign courts mandated their return. The judgment of an American court to hand over the Tarbosaurus bataar skeleton in a case launched by Mongolia’s president prompted the museum’s founding. Another case made headlines when Nicolas Cage returned a Tarbosaurus bataar skull he had bought years earlier (the American actor was not accused of wrongdoing). These successes have spurred more repatriation efforts and investments. So while it may be some time until live stegosauruses wander an amusement park, a shiny future for Mongolian paleontology appears within reach.  Displays in Mongolian and English explain each specimen and offer informational tidbits, such as why it's entirely reasonable to ask if dinosaurs had feathers. A local, English-speaking guide is usually on hand as well. The museum is open everyday from 10 to 7 (summer) or 9 to 6 (winter), even during holidays such as Naadam.

On the northeast shore you can see a dramatic and jagged silhouette against the azure sky, made by shamanistic heaps of stones called “ovoos.” Ovoos are found on many high peaks throughout Mongolia, and according to tradition, when someone approaches he or she is to circle it three times (always clockwise), and then add a few rocks to the ever-reaching pile. Over time they grow, often to impressive heights, some as high as 10 feet (3 m). Terkhiin Tsagaan is also known as White Lake, due to the thick layer of snow sitting on its frozen surface for the better part of the year. Local legend says that the lake was created by a giant tossing a rock that made an enormous hole on landing, but the more down-to-earth explanation goes back thousands of years, and an eruption of the nearby Khorgo Volcano. This geological history is partly what makes the Terkhiin Tsagaan Lake ovoos stand out: They are made by using the black lava rocks that pepper the surrounding terrain. This, and the sheer number of them—in all, hundreds have been ritualistically created, making for a singular and eerie landscape. Terkhiin-Tsagaan is in west-central Mongolia, and the easiest way of accessing the lake is by following a dirt road from Khorgo Volcano. This leads to the north-east shore of the lake, where the ovoos can be found.",rock formations lakes rocks water geology

Strangely, its shape and unusual location aren’t its most fascinating features. The rock has 150 writings etched all over its surface. The scrawled sentiments cover the rock from top to bottom. The most ancient of these writings are in Turkic languages and date back to the 6th century AD. You’ll find words jotted down in other languages, too, like Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese. The inscriptions are proof that Taikhar Rock has been an important site for more than 1,500 years. Adding new writings is a tradition that continues to this day, though most of the current inscriptions seem to mainly be about political slogans or declarations of eternal love. An oovo (a heap of sacred stones) was placed on top to reassert the religious significance of this site. There are two radically different explanations for the rock’s unusual appearance—one mystical, one scientific. According to one account, a mythical giant named Bukhbilegt used this looming chunk of granite to plug a hole in the ground once frequented by a gargantuan snake. But according to a more plausible theory, Taikhar Rock is the result of the nearby river eroding the granite mountains and flooding the area over millions of years.",graffiti legends rocks religion geology sacred spaces
53,Imperial Map Monument,"Harhorin, Mongolia","History, geography, and shamanism meet in this eye-catching monument to the greatness of three empires.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/imperial-map-monument,"Imperial Map Monument commemorates the three empires that settled on the shore of the nearby Orkhon River. Also known as King’s Monument and Monument for the Mongol States, it was built in 2004 on a hill overlooking the town of Kharkhorin. The monument consists of a large pile of stones (a shamanic ovoo) carefully assembled in the shape of a cone, approximately the same size as a tepee, with nine poles protruding from the top. This structure is mounted on a stone-and-concrete platform, and it is surrounded by three walls representing three sections of a circle. The outer sides of these walls feature three colorful mosaics depicting three maps, one for each of the empires. First, there was the Xiongnu Empire, a confederation of nomadic tribes living in the steppes from around the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE. The Turkic Khaganate Empire followed, established by the Göktürks in 682 and lasting only until 744. Finally, and famously, Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries. The Mongol Empire’s iconic place in the culture, combined with the shamanic symbolism of the ovoo in the center of the monument, entice people to leave offerings of vodka, milk, tea, rice, and other edible titbits that inevitably attract birds and the occasional herd of goats and sheep passing by. Several animal skulls can also be found around the monument, completing the surreal scene. It is no coincidence that the Imperial Map Monument is located in Kharkhorin, as this town (then called Karakorum) was the capital of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan’s successor, Ögedei. Imperial Map Monument is a great vantage point to take in the modern town of Kharkhorin and the Orkhon River, and picture what this collection of dirt roads and low-rise buildings may have looked like in its glory days.

It was opened in 1996 under the supervision of the Ministry of Defense. Two sections of the museum are on the ground floor. The first section is dedicated to weapons found in archaeological sites all around the country. You can spot items like bows, arrowheads, axes, and knives from the Bronze Age. Weapons and objects such as armor, horse saddles, and stirrups from later epochs are also collected here. Alongside these artifacts you’ll find reconstructions of other old military items like several swords, two 13th-century uniforms, and a catapult stand. The second section of the museum is packed with modern weapons from the 20th and 21st centuries. Most of the items are from World War I and World War II and are predominantly Mongolian, but you’ll also spot some Russian, Japanese, and German weapons in the mix as well. There are also numerous portraits of Mongolian military heroes and a cordoned-off area with a painting of Lenin looming over a desk.

55,Centre of Shaman Eternal Heavenly Sophistication,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",A nondescript dirt lot hides an intriguing center of shamanic healing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/centre-of-shaman-eternal-heavenly-sophistication,"The Centre of Shaman Eternal Heavenly Sophistication is a rather grandiose name for a place that is, to say the least, underwhelming at first sight. The center is a small dirt yard wedged between modern buildings and a busy road. Like many others in the neighborhood, this dirt yard has a ger (traditional tent) and a semi-permanent ger-like structure. But don’t be fooled by its initial appearance. This place may lack in charm or distinctiveness, but it’s supposed to be as authentic as it gets. A shaman renowned for her power to mediate between this and the other world lives on the premise, and more than one shaman may be on the premise at any given time. The semi-permanent ger-like structure is the heart of the center. There’s no sign and no indication it’s anything other than someone’s private dwelling, so it can be quite unnerving to push the door open. All along the circular perimeter of the structure there are tables and cabinets neatly displaying statuettes, figurines, seashells, beads, pebbles, incense burners, scrolls, drums, antlers, bones, and other (seemingly) random items. The circular display is interrupted by a large wooden chair sitting on a bear skin and by a collection of furry and feathered costumes, a heavy leather outfit, and traditional hats. Outside, there’s an altar that consists of some poles arranged in the style of a tepee and covered by animal hide, but the strong winds from the steppes have blown away part of the covering. A table for offerings and three tridents adorned with yak hair complete the altar. Other features in the yard include two white statues, an ovoo with the skull of a bull, and the ger where the shaman lives. No one knows for certain how long shamanism has been part of Mongolian culture, but it’s been present since at least the earliest recorded history. Instead of being pushed aside by the arrival of Buddhism, it mingled with it, giving birth to the Mongolian Buddhist tradition. The socialist regime repressed all forms of religious expressions, but shamanism never died. With the collapse of the socialist regime in the last century, it came back. Now, it’s pretty common to come across people offering shamanic services. Pictures aren't allowed within the actual center, but you can photograph the outer yard.",cultures and civilizations roadside attractions religion sacred spaces
56,Danzanravjaa Museum,"Sainshand, Mongolia",Hidden treasures belonging to Mongolia's most revered and multi-talented monk spent decades buried in the Gobi desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/danzanravjaa-museum,"The story of the museum dedicated to Dulduityn Danzanravjaa, one of Mongolia’s most revered and multi-talented monks, is almost as dramatic as the man himself. His treasured possessions, such as several kangling (flute made of human femur), a damaru (double-headed drum made of two human skulls), and two kapala (cup made of human skull cups) were long buried in remote, secret locations around the Gobi desert. Danzanravjaa, known by epithets such as the “Lama of the Gobi,” belonged to the Nyingma school of Buddhism, and was the fifth reincarnation in the Noyon Khutukt line of monks. He was born in 1803 and was identified as a lama when he was 12, before which he wandered around the Gobi with his minstrel father, singing songs for money. His biggest claim to fame is his poetry, in which he criticized social evils that he witnessed around him. This is followed closely by his divination, paintings, and writings on medicine, philosophy, and astrology. He was also an active advocate for public education, and set up a primary school, a library and a museum at the monastery where he resided. As if this were not enough, Dulduityn Danzanravjaa was also a talented dancer and choreographer, and established a theatre company that staged dances, plays, and operas promoting women’s rights. In short, Danzanravjaa was the consummate Renaissance man, and is remembered for his immense contributions to all of these fields. Danzanravjaa died in 1856 under shadowy circumstances, believed to have been poisoned by one of his enemies. With the end of his life began the story of the museum in his name that stands today. One of his trusted disciples, Balchinchoijoo collected all his possessions, stored them in crates, and acted as the curator of Danzanravjaa’s relics. This role was passed down to his heirs, and it was the duty of a descendent named Tudev to safeguard them during the Soviet era in the 20th century. At the time, there was a crackdown against religious institutions and artifacts, and hundreds of monastic complexes in Mongolia were destroyed. Tudev carefully prepared each crate for storage and even set traps for extra protection. Every night he buried one in a remote location in the Gobi desert, and memorized the location. In this manner, he managed to bury 64 of the nearly 1,500 crates before the army destroyed the remaining artifacts. He passed on the information about the location of the buried treasures only to his heir, his grandson Altangerel. When Mongolia became free of Communist rule in 1990, it was finally safe for Altangerel to dig up the crates and see what remained of artifacts. Another 24 boxes were unearthed and the relics were placed in the museum in Sainshand, which was opened the following year. Among the exhibits are the costumes used for his theatrical productions, the aforementioned kangling, damaru, and kapala, some shamanistic implements, samples of his manuscripts, and other paraphernalia rescued from the many monasteries that he set up.",theater relics buddhism saints soviet history medicine religion sacred spaces museums and collections art

Located in the westernmost province of Mongolia, the 15-kilometer site is home to at least 10,000 figures pecked and engraved during the Neolithic Period and the Bronze Age. Many of the petroglyphs depict humans herding or hunting wild animals, offering a glimpse of how the hunter-gatherer lifestyle would eventually give way to the domestication of animals as livestock. A closer look reveals that some of the figures resemble extant wildlife—animals that continue to roam this alpine landscape today—such as red deer, ibexes, and snow leopards.

58,Beatles Monument,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",A beloved tribute to the Fab Four and the freedoms they inspired.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beatles-monument-mongolia,"This seemingly random, incongruous little monument in the capital of Mongolia  commemorates not only one of the world’s most beloved bands, but also an important time in recent Mongolian history. Set in a small square near the State Department store, the monument marks the place where, in Communist times, young Mongolians would assemble and listen to forbidden Western music and discuss ideas of freedom and democracy. The Beatles’ music is even credited with inspiring Mongolians to fight for their democracy. On one side of the monument, you’ll see bas-reliefs of the four Beatles. Head to the other side, and you’ll uncover a depiction of a young man sitting on some stairs, strumming a guitar. This image pays tribute to the many Mongolian youths who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s and were inspired by the iconic group. But though the tribute to the Beatles is a beloved part of the city, for a while, it seemed as though developers were not content to just let it be. In 2017, locals took to the streets to save the monument, which had been slated for demolition. Their protests paid off, and the monument still stands today.

59,Mongolian Railway History Museum,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",A collection of old steam and diesel locomotives sitting in a fenced-off garden.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mongolian-railway-history-museum,"Not far from the Ulaanbaatar Railway Station, six obsolete locomotives sit unmoving in a fenced-off garden adjacent to the tracks. The open-air display of trains, collectively known as the Mongolian Railway History Museum, is dedicated to the history of the locomotives that once traversed the country. One is outfitted with a golden plate depicting Joseph Stalin, while two others bear red, five-pointed stars, a symbol associated with communist ideology. Railway development has played a significant role in recent Mongolian history, especially in relation to the coal mining industry. Extending south from the Mongolia–Russia border, the Trans-Mongolian Railway reached Ulaanbaatar in 1950, and was expanded to the southern Chinese border some five years later. Prior to that, there were only a few freight trains carrying coal between Mongolian mines and Russian coal plants. The collection features three steam-powered trains as well as three diesel-powered locomotives. For railway buffs, these include: Locomotive 2-10-0 (L-3167), 750mm gauge T159, Voroshilovgrad 2M62M-043, Te1-20-011 (erroneously marked as TEM1-166), Baldwin/ALCO-influenced 2-10-0, and Su 208-88.  The museum is located at the intersection of Narnii Road and Peace Bridge.  The gate is typically locked, but the fence surrounding the collection is low, so you can appreciate the locomotives from the outside.",railroads trains history
60,Mongolia/Russia Border Crossing No. 487,"Teshig, Mongolia",This extremely remote border crossing was closed to prevent smuggling and looting.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mongoliarussia-border-crossing-no-487,"Many places in Mongolia feel remote due to the long distances dividing them, with precious little to see along the way except the vastness of the steppes and the occasional herd. Yet, even by Mongolian standards, the Mongolia/Russia Border Crossing N. 487 is as remote and obscure as it gets. For one, the crossing has no attractions anywhere near it, and two, reaching it requires significant logistical arrangements. There are some excellent reasons to visit it, but you have to be seriously committed to getting to this isolated location. Border Crossing No. 487 is set deep inside thousands of hectares of Siberian forest, both on the Mongolian and Russian side. On the Mongolian side, very few hamlets can be found across this desolate landscape, and the infrastructure is extremely poor. What’s more, winter brings abundant snowfall and subarctic temperatures (reaching -55 degrees F), making these places reachable only by horses and the sturdiest 4x4 vehicles. There are currently 10 operating border crossings between Mongolia and Russia: five open only to Mongol and Russian nationals, three open to all, one open to freight, and one to passenger trains. There used to be more, and the history of those closed borders speaks to the complex relationship between these two countries. The current Northern Mongolian border was established in 1911, but at that time, Mongolia shared it with two countries, the Tuvan Republic and the Soviet Union. Now, it’s shared only with Russia, after the Soviet Union annexed the Tuvan Republic in 1944. The Tuvan section of the Mongolia/Russia border has always been problematic due to cattle thefts across the border and a thriving smuggling trade, and Border Crossing No. 487 was considered a hot-spot for these activities. Due to the terrain and the remoteness, controlling the border was all but impossible, and it was therefore decided that Border Crossing No. 487 would close. To deter looters and smugglers, the border guards on both sides are instructed to shoot trespassers that enter the area without a permit. Drastic as it may sound, it seems that the move succeeded in pacifying the region. Since its closure, Border Crossing No. 487 has become a destination for a trickle of local tourists. The two posts delimitating the Mongol and Russian territories are set about 10 feet apart, and a white stump of a post was placed in the middle to demarcate the exact border point. It is a simple sight, in a way, but it is steeped in local history and natural beauty.  Do not go to this border crossing without a permit. To visit, you must obtain a permit from the General Authority for Border Protection in Ulaanbaatar. Once you have the permit, you need a 4x4 vehicle to negotiate the 180-km of dirt road from the Bulgan-Murun Road to the border. Along the way, you’ll encounter muddy patches of road, sharp rocks, sand banks and several rivers to ford. Depending on the time of the year and the weather, river depth can be a serious obstacle. Approximately 20 km to the border, there is a road block with a few houses around. Permits are checked here, and an armed guard will be assigned to escort visitors to the border.",border crossings geography borders geographic markers politics history
61,Kharkhorin Rock,"Kharkhorin, Mongolia",A mysterious phallic rock on the grounds of a Buddhist monastery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kharkhorin-rock,"Wandering around Erdene Zuu Monastery, the oldest Buddhist monastery in Mongolia, the absolute last thing you’d expect to find is a sculpture of a penis. But just northeast of the building, there it is: a 24-inch stone phallus known as Kharkhorin Rock, standing alone in the middle of a dusty patch of ground, protected by a small fence. Why in the world would such a risqué sculpture be placed in the middle of a historic spiritual sanctuary? The answer is steeped in centuries of legend. The story goes that there was once a monk who swore to be celibate, but was secretly a womanizer. When the other monks discovered this hidden secret, he was castrated, but they were worried that this offense would inspire similar deeds from a different monk. The large stone phallus seemed to do the trick, serving as a constant, explicit reminder to stay celibate. What makes the story more bizarre is that many women in the area believe Kharkhorin Rock has a completely opposite spiritual purpose, facilitating the miracle of childbirth. Legend has it that women who stand with their legs spread to straddle the sculpture will be more likely to successfully bear a child.",phallic buddhism legends rocks religion sculptures geology sacred spaces statues
62,Abandoned Petroleum Distribution Center,"Hatgal, Mongolia",Traces of the thriving lake trade that once linked the Soviet Union with Mongolia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-petroleum-distribution-center,"Hatgal is a village with fewer than 3,000 inhabitants, though the number swells in the summer when tourists flock to town. It is situated on the southernmost tip of Lake Khovsgol, the largest lake in Mongolia by volume, and it stretches almost all the way to the border between Mongolia and neighboring Russia. In the 1980s, the population was more than double what it is today. These were the golden days for Hatgal, when trade between Mongolia and the Soviet Union was at its peak. Being a satellite state of the USSR for 70 years, Mongolia had a very limited choice of trade partners, and Khovsgol Lake provided an optimal solution for transporting goods between the two Communist countries. In the summer, boats would ply the lake’s navigable routes, and in winter, trucks would travel on its frozen surface as if it were a highway. Apart from being a thriving lakeside port town, Hatgat was also home to an important petroleum distribution center. Petroleum was imported from the USSR, stored in the massive tanks by the lake shore, and eventually distributed throughout Western Mongolia. The government of Mongolia introduced some laws restricting the amount of traffic over Lake Khovsgol due to increasing pollution. However, the real economic blow came in 1991, when the USSR collapsed almost overnight and trade plummeted to nothing. The petroleum distribution has sat abandoned ever since. Of its original facilities, a couple of buildings on the lake shore that used to house administrative personnel are now badly cracked, but are still (barely) standing. Six huge metal tanks are still connected to the network of pipelines that used to carry petroleum to the furthest reaches of Western Mongolia. Four boats survived the test of time, two of which were probably used as oil tankers. Several other boats can be seen laying at the bottom of the lake. To some, these facilities are eyesores on the shore of a beautiful glacial lake, but for anyone interested in industrial archaeology, they are important relics of a geopolitical era that is no more.",energy communism soviet history industrial lakes infrastructure water abandoned

It’s a granite stone that natural elements molded into a vaguely human form. Pilgrims flock to this location to seek advice and have their dreams or wishes granted. The worshippers that journey here make offerings in the form of biscuits, rice, milk, and vodka. These goodies are placed on tables or liberally scattered and splashed all around the compound. Consequently, Eej Khad may not be a paragon of cleanliness, but it’s all part of the ceremony. As the name suggests, the rock is likened to a female figure, and many pilgrims see it as symbolic of motherly protection, generosity, and wisdom. The standard practice is to express three dreams or wishes and circle the rock three times. Eej Khad tends to attract wishes related to procreation, general wellbeing, especially for children, and a plentiful harvest. Others treat the rock as a proxy for their deceased mothers, with whom they seek communion and comfort. Eej Khad is covered by a woman’s garment and a ponytail is attached at the back to enhance the human resemblance. The whole area surrounding the rock is peppered with oovos and sacred rocks, and shamans can occasionally be seen performing rituals at the site.  Eej Khad is located on the slope of the Avdar Bayan Uul mountain in the central Mongolian steppe, roughly 70 miles south of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city. It is at least a 10 miles off the nearest major road, the Zuunmod-Mandalgovi Highway.",pilgrimages rituals buddhism rock formations rocks religion geology sacred spaces

Antonov An-24 airplanes were produced in the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1979, and only 1,264 models saw the light of day. China produced another 103 models of an aircraft identical to the Antonov An-24, but under the name Xian Y-7. The Antonov aircraft was equipped with two four-blade propellers powered by a turbine engine (a turboprop). The Antonov An-24 may not be the epitome of elegance and beauty, but was built to withstand harsh conditions, and it did. It was able to take off and land on unpaved surfaces and needed little maintenance. The sturdiness and reliability of the aircraft was perfect for the challenging environment of Mongolia. In the 1960s and 1970s, several models of Antonov An-24 were acquired by the Mongolian Air Force and by two civil operators, namely MIAT and Hangard Airline. These aircraft are no longer used in Mongolia neither for military nor for civil service. They were instead parked in residential Ulaanbaatar as part of the MIAT fleet. This particular aircraft currently belongs to the School of Mechanical Engineering and Transportation. It appears abandoned but is in fact, used for educational purposes. The buildings surrounding the aircraft resemble ordinary apartment blocks found in the same neighborhood. Measuring 77 feet (23.53 meters) in length and 26 feet (8.30 meters) in height, the Antonov An-24 looks out of place and makes for a curious sight in the neighborhood.",schools airplanes design history & culture

This historical monastery is dwarfed by the striking modern buildings towering around it. The meeting of the new and the old architecture is conflicting and harmonious at once. Built using blue bricks and topped by a wooden roof, the temples in this monastery are rare specimens of pre-revolution structures exhibiting Chinese architecture in Mongolia. After four years of construction work, the monastery became operative in 1908, but soon after its inauguration, the monastery faced an uncertain future. The advent of the Communist revolution in Mongolia in 1921 brought with it the resolve to erase all manifestations of religious traditions. Very few monasteries and temples survived the purges, and those that did survive were deprived of their religious significance and reconceptualized as museums, buildings of historical importance, or simply used for administrative purposes. Choijin Lama Monastery survived as a museum of religious artifacts. Each of the five temples in the monastery is dedicated to a deity. The main temple features an 18th-century statue of the Shakyamuni Buddha. On its right is a statue of Choijin Lama, and on its left is the statue of Baldan Choephel (teacher and head monk) with his mummified remains encased. Together, these temples house a vast collection of Buddhist masks, thangkas (Buddhist paintings on fabric), sculptures, and scriptures. Along the wooden panes covering one of the temples are possibly the most eye-catching paintings in the entire complex. An array of gruesome images portray mangled bodies, severed limbs, and dangling organs. This is the section of the temple dedicated to the Naraka, or Buddhist Hell. This kind of religious art is meant to encourage believers to conduct a virtuous life and remind them to make merits in order to lessen the suffering in Naraka.",communism buddhism monasteries temples history & culture museums
66,Bagan,"Nyaung-U, Myanmar (Burma)","Over 2,000 ancient temples dot the Myanmar landscape at the site of this famed archaeological site.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bagan,"At its prime, the former city of Bagan on the plains of central Burma was likely a wondrous metropolis of ornate, gleaming temple spires and ritual artistry. But it’s possibly even more beautiful and mysterious now that it’s a jaw-dropping ruin. During its heyday around the 12th century, the capital of the Kingdom of Pagan contained well over 10,000 Buddhist temples, stupas, and pagodas. Eventually, the city was brought to ruin by natural disasters and hordes of Mongols, who made light work of the city’s Buddhist inhabitants. Through the centuries, thousands of the temples and pagodas crumbled under their own weight or were destroyed, leaving only a little over 2,000 of the structures today. However, this has done little to diminish the scope of the city’s grandeur. The almost impossibly ornate temples that survive rise up out of the overgrown foliage. The structures, which burst from the plains, look like the creations of a lost civilization. While that is not strictly true, as many of the inhabitants of Bagan would sire the generations that created modern Myanmar, a sense of mystery still pervades the city. Still covering 26 square miles of land, the thousands of ruined temples and religious monuments are now a protected historical site. While some of the structures have fallen into complete disrepair, many others almost look as if they haven’t aged a day, thanks to modern restoration efforts.  The best place to lodge in the area is Old Bagan. With the influx of tourists in recent times, new hotels in New Bagan and Nyaung-U are also opening. Bagan can be toured on foot, giving you an impressive perspective of the old city, although the preferred method of experiencing the ruins (technically known as the Bagan Archaeological Zone today) is via hot air balloon. Balloon rides are offered that bring visitors to a vantage point where they can view the thousands of temples at once. However, the hot air balloon season in Bagan is very short (from October 1 to March 31) due to the extremely hot weather in the region.

While most of Kakku’s stupas were built in the 17th and 18th centuries, the largest is believed to have been built in the 12th century during the reign of Alaungsithu, King of Bagan, as part of expanding religious sites across his empire. Since then, two main architectural designs have created a distinct forest of 2,478 needle stick pagodas that reach out to take the shape of Buddha’s footprint. From the main stupa, where wisps of omnipresent incense smoke perfume the musty air, visitors can walk through the small channels within rows of smaller stupas, each breathtaking in their nuanced designs, many featuring stucco reliefs in differing forms of veneration. While the renovation is ongoing, plenty of the stupas suffer from varying degrees of weathering and damage from the odd earthquake that blights many temple complexes within Myanmar. Due to its remoteness and location within Shan State, visitors are few, although the authorities have created a reflecting pool for photographic delights. Thankfully, unlike at other more famous temples, there isn’t the need to wait for hours to get that cover shot.  Tours are available from the Inle area. If traveling independently, admission to the site is US $3 and a compulsory, but knowledgeable, Pa-O guide costs $5 payable at the tourism office in Taunggyi.

Then, in 1839, it was leveled by earthquakes and subsequently abandoned. The wheel of fortune turns on us all, human and city alike. Inwa — also spelled Innwa, known in classical Pali as Ratanapura (“City of Gems”), and known locally as Awa or Ava — was originally founded in 1365. Located at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Myitnge Rivers on an artificial island formed by a canal connecting the two rivers upstream from their natural point of meeting, Inwa was built to be the capital of a newly unified kingdom that came to be known, appropriately enough, as the Kingdom of Ava. And so it remained for 190 years, serving not only as the seat of power in Upper Burma, but also as the center of a flourishing period of Burmese literature. In 1555 the Kingdom of Ava fell. However, the city of Inwa and its political prestige lived on, serving as the capital of all of Burma from 1599 to 1613, then again from 1635 to 1752, then again from 1765 to 1783. Then again from 1821 to 1842. The aforementioned series of devastating earthquakes struck on March 22, 1839; the entire region was affected, but the capital was hit particularly hard. Although Inwa had been sacked, destroyed, and rebuilt several times over its long history, this time it would not be so. The city was not rebuilt, the capital was officially moved to Amarapura on February 10, 1842, and Inwa was left to the elements. The former imperial city is now a rural area where livestock graze and farmers raise crops amidst the remains of pagodas, palace towers, monasteries, and massive city walls that once formed the outline of a seated lion. One of the monasteries — Bagaya Kyaung, a towering structure built entirely of teak — is still in use as a monastery and school today.

The Mingun Pahtodawgyi is a nice pile of bricks indeed and holds the record for being the biggest pile of bricks in the world. Intended to be a 500 foot high stupa, a mound housing Buddhist relics, the Pahtodawgyi remains unfinished to this day but is still an awe-inspiring structure. Measuring 450 by 450 feet and 172 feet high, it dwarfs the surrounding area, and would easily have rivaled the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza had King Bodawpaya finished its construction. Construction began in 1790, using mostly slave labor, and causing a massive drain on resources and manpower in the area. The project was widely unpopular during its time, which some suspect caused its cessation. King Bodawpaya was a superstitious man and during the construction, it was prophesied that the completion of the great stupa would cause his death or the destruction of the country. Worried about maintaining his empire, the king slowed progress on the stupa. When he died, construction was abandoned completely. Despite not completing the stupa, construction on an accompanying bell was finished, and was similarly grand in size. The finished bell weighed over 200,000 pounds and is 12 feet high. The massive bell can be rung by striking the outside since it has no internal ringing mechanism. Since the early 19th century, the stupa has become increasingly decrepit. An earthquake in 1839 left giant cracks along the face of the stupa, and wear and tear have led it to become almost natural looking.

Whether this worship keeps the boulder from rolling down the precipice is unclear, but the gold-leaf covered stone certainly inspires all who visit. At 25 feet high and 50 feet around, the golden boulder in Mon State, Myanmar is hard to miss. According to legend, a Buddhist hermit was given a strand of hair from the Buddha himself, which he then gave to the king. For his gift, the king offered the hermit a boulder shaped like his head, and used magical powers to pull the boulder from the ocean. The king then built the small pagoda atop the rock to enshrine the Buddha’s hair for all eternity and pilgrims have flocked to the site ever since. Although the pagoda is small by comparison to other grand Buddhist places of worship, its location on the precarious boulder makes up for its miniature 24-foot spire. Seemingly barely resting on its base, the precariously placed golden rock draws thousands every year. Pilgrimage is at its peak during the Full Moon day of Tabaung in March, when 90,000 candles are lit at the site and the golden boulder shines in the night sky. There is accommodation available at the top of the Mountain, or in Kinpun, at the foot of the Mountain, where you can then travel up by pick-up truck (one way costs 2,500 Kyat).

As the legend goes, two brothers were traveling when they encountered the Buddha beneath a tree. After feeding him, Buddha offered them a gift and gave them exactly eight hairs from his head. The brothers then carried the sacred hairs in a ruby casket back to their country where, with the help of the king, they began building what would become the Shwedagon Pagoda complex. When the casket containing the holy hair was opened, the relic unleashed a flood of miracles including causing the blind to see, the lame to walk, and seeing a rain of gemstones issue from the sky. A number of other relics were also entombed at the shrine including a holy staff, a piece of cloth from a sacred figures robe, and oddly a revered water filter. If the legend is believed, the pagoda is around 2,600 years old, but many scientists have placed its construction closer to 1,000 to 1,400 years old. Either way, the opulent site has survived through war and political turmoil in the area and still looms over Yangon in glittering glory. The large central stupa is covered in real gold plates that are constantly donated from countries around the world as needed, and its tip is encrusted with rubies and diamonds. Both spiritually and materially glorious, the Shwedagon Pagoda is one of the wonders of the modern Buddhist world, and may be one of the fanciest sites ever to be founded on a handful of hair. Head towards the golden stupa that towers over Yangon. Shwedagon Pagoda is open daily, from 4-22. Last admission is at 21:45. The ticket is valid for the whole day, so you can visit the pagoda during the day and also at night. Shwedagon Pagoda on weekends and middle of the day can get really crowded, so avoid this time. If possible hire a guide, who will explain everything about the pagoda and the rituals, enhancing your experience hugely. You won't be allowed to enter the temple grounds if you're dressed in shorts.

The landscape around the small town of Hpa’an in Karen State, Myanmar, combines lush open fields and single, bulbous mountains. At the bottom of one such mountain is a steep staircase, painted white. Once at the top, a narrow path leads you into the Saddar Cave, hollowed out of the rock. Buddhist statues, like road signs of all different shapes and sizes, beckon visitors into the darkness. Hundreds of miniature golden icons not much bigger than playing cards form a mosaic onto the righthand side of the cave. You’ll pass a pagoda about the size of a small van and the light then weakens. Visitors must remove their shoes. Only then does the stench of bat droppings fill the nostrils. Sometimes you can hear the bats shriek. Inside the mountain, the painted faces of Buddhist sculptures occasionally flicker into view as you wander through the darkness. Karen State is famous for its Buddhist sites, but Saddar Cave is truly a natural wonder, as well as a holy place. Flash photography illuminates stalactites dripping from the ceiling and stalagmites rise up from the ground, formed over centuries. In one section of the cave a ray of sunshine beams down directly onto one of the largest stalagmites. The path ends at the entrance to open water, where a local boatman armed with a paddle next to a flat wooden canoe will continue your journey out of the cave and out onto a pristine blue lagoon. Paddle around and watch fisherman source their lunch against a backdrop of the limestone rock face.

The Kuthodaw Pagoda was built 1857 by King Mindon Min. The gorgeous temple building is completely gilded on the exterior, giving it the look of a solid gold spectacle. However the true spectacle lays within the stark white stupas that surround its base. Beneath the pinnacled roofs of the squat little structures are 730 marble tablets (729 contain body of the text, while the 730th tablet describes their creation) covered on both sides with dense script. Taken all together, these comprise the entirety of Theravāda Buddhism’s religious canon, its tipitaka (a phrase meaning “three baskets,”which is a reference to the baskets in which the original Buddhist teachings were held). The thick stone tablets each stand over five feet tall and five inches thick. When the tablets were unveiled in 1868, each line of writing had been filled with golden ink and the stones were decorated with precious stones including rubies and diamonds. Unfortunately after the British invaded in the mid-1880s, the troops looted the temple site, stripping the slabs of their gold ink and gems. However today the sprawling book still stands, and the writing has been refilled with simple black ink so that while the opulent glory may have disappeared, the messages of the writings themselves live on for future generations.

The average pagoda tour on the other hand is the complete opposite, and in many ways the most quintessential difference between East and West. Thanboddhay Pagoda is a massive Buddhist complex in Monywa, Myanmar. It is a gilded world, brightly screaming out praise for Buddha through colorful celebration. Throughout the area, each pillar and tower of the Pagoda is carefully and completely covered with images of Buddha. From statues inside the pagoda, to miniatures climbing the sides of the building itself, there are 500,000 depictions of Buddha in total. Although it was originally built in the early 14th century, it was reconstructed in 1939, and is incredibly preserved in its golden form. Unlike many other temples in Myanmar, the entrance is not guarded by lions. Instead, two imposing white elephants stand out against their shimmering backdrop.

Climbing 777 steps from the base of the vertical pedestal takes you to a monastery honoring what has come to be known as the center of Nat spirit activity in the nation. In Buddhist traditions of Myanmar, Nats are spirits of humans that met tragic ends and are portrayed accordingly in shrines across the country. One of the most well-known of the 37 spirits in the shrine of Mount Popa is Ko Gyi Kyaw, who died from his wild lifestyle and alcohol abuse. As the patron saint of tramps and alcoholics, his shrine is often covered in bottles of whiskey. Due to the Nat activity and shrine on Mount Popa, the area is known as the Mount Olympus of Myanmar. The shrine subsequently draws thousands of pilgrims every year, especially during full moon ceremonies two times per year. Non-religious visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the lush mountains, as well as the monkeys that live and beg for food around the monastery. Estimated 2,000 Rhesus macaques live in the monastery today and because of this, monkey poop is prevalent on the monastery steps (which pilgrims and visitors are supposed to climb barefoot). Consequently, a high number of people make their living cleaning up after the monkeys in exchange of a donation, and this fact has originated mixed feedback from visitors to Mount Popa.   Mount Popa is roughly 30 miles Southwest of Bagan. Wearing comfortable clothing covering the neckline and shoulders, cotton skirts (or pants) is ideal. The dress code is the same as for visiting Bagan temples. Since you are expected to walk barefoot, you can also bring socks to protect your feet.",rites and rituals geological oddities natural wonders geology nature sacred spaces
76,U Bein Bridge,"Mandalay, Myanmar (Burma)",The oldest teak bridge in the world is made from the remains of a royal palace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/u-bein-bridge,"Stretching across Taungthaman Lake in Myanmar, the U Bein Bridge might look like just another rickety wooden crossing (which it is), but this historic span is actually made of the remains of a royal palace. Construction on the wooden bridge was completed in 1851 after three years. The bridge was built at a slight curve, and is supported by over a thousand wooden pillars that were hammered into the bottom of the shallow lake. The planks of teak that make up the surface of the bridge were taken from the old royal palace of Inwa, a former Burmese capital, that had been razed a number of times. The resulting bridge might not look very royal, but its history certainly is. Reaching three-quarters of a mile in length, the ramshackle span is surprisingly long for a wooden bridge with no rails, but it cuts a striking figure. The bridge has become one of the region’s most popular tourist attractions and most photographed features. It is especially striking in the evening when the colors of the sunset paint the scene in natural color. This of course means that the bridge becomes more crowded during those times. All the attention has taken its toll on the span. Some of the pillars have been replaced with concrete, and many of the original planks will need to be replaced or refurbished, lest they come off completely. Nonetheless, the bridge is still a beautiful and popular place to capture the beauty of Myanmar.",bridges architectural oddities architecture
77,Snake Pagoda of Myanmar,"Kyaukse, Myanmar (Burma)",These serpents are considered holy and pampered accordingly.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snake-pagoda,"Officially called Yadana Labamuni Hsu-taungpye Paya, this Myanmar pagoda is generally known by another name: Hmwe Paya, or the “Snake Pagoda.” This out-of-the-way pagoda near Mandalay is distinguished by the large pythons who live happily coiled around the Buddha statue within. The temple was founded in 1974 when a Buddhist monk was tending the old pagoda. Inside, the monk found two large pythons wrapped around a statue of Buddha. The monk dutifully carried the snakes out to the jungle and returned to clean the pagoda. Within a day the snakes were back, and a third had joined. Each time, the monks would carry the snakes out to the jungle, and each time they would return. Eventually the monks came to see the snakes as holy, possibly the reincarnated souls of monks who used to tend to the pagoda. The monks stopped removing the snakes and instead began taking care of them. They take such nice care of them, in fact, that it makes sense that the snakes like to hang around the pagoda. The two pythons currently in residence are fed a pot of milk and three eggs every five days as well as a small amount of goat meat. Every morning at 11:00 a.m., the snakes are lovingly washed by the monks in a bath filled with flower petals. They are sometimes even dried with money left as an offering at the pagoda. Each year, thousands of the faithful make a pilgrimage to the temple, and the walls of the pagoda are lined with photos of families visiting the semi-holy serpents. Some depict toddlers happily bathing alongside the snakes. They snakes have never been known to injure anyone and seem quite happy to be touched by the visitors. Though the original pythons have died, new snakes have since been donated by faithful followers. The original snakes can still be seen in the pagoda, albeit in a taxidermied state. Considering the level of care the snakes receive, the snakes no doubt lived a long and happy life. The area surrounding the snake pagoda is also worth exploring and is full of overgrown and beautiful ruins rarely visited by tourists.

Those who visit can expect to find beautiful glass works in shades of blues, greens, whites, and reds buried beneath the mess of flora. The Nagar Glass Factory was Myanmar’s premier glass-making enterprise for decades and the country’s first hand-blown glass-factory. Their customers included the Pan Am airline company, independence leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and even the astronaut John Glenn. But it all came to an end when Cyclone Nargis, the worst natural disaster to ever hit the country, obliterated the factory in 2008. What remains in the jungle around the ruins of the former factory are the countless pieces of colorful glass that were in production or storage at the time. Amazingly, a large percentage of them somehow remain completely intact. It’s a bizarre, otherworldly and strangely beautiful site, even if the circumstances that led to its current state are tragic. Today, the family that ran the factory for decades still accepts visitors. In fact, every piece of glass lying in the jungle is available for purchase. It’s up to each visitor, however, to dig for his or her own treasure among the sprawling forest. While you’re there, be sure to take your time while scavenging through the layers of leaves that blanket the floor beneath the masses of toppled trees. You’ll be rewarded with small treasures like wine glasses, drinking glasses, and fruit bowls. The Nagar Glass Factory is about a 20 minute walk from either Kamaryut or Thiri Myaing stations on Yangon's circular train line. It's not the easiest place to find and there are no signs along the way to point you in the right direction. Furthermore, many locals aren't even aware that it's still possible to visit.

It was constructed during the annexation of Burma by the British, as an exclusive watering hole for soldiers and officials of the British Army. The complex features long, two-story mansions that served as ballrooms, salons, and private rooms. It was one of the most prestigious and popular of the gentlemen’s clubs built in Southeast Asia during the height of the British Empire. The club wined and dined British royalty and many high-ranking officials within its walls, and its name lives on through its signature gin-based cocktail, the Pegu Club, that’s still served in bars today. Sadly, the racist membership policy of the time limited admission to whites only, and locals were only allowed in the club as workers. Somewhat surprisingly, the club stayed open for about two decades after Burmese independence was gained. It was eventually taken over by the Burmese military and later abandoned and left to rot. For years, the old colonial-era clubhouse remained in a state of decay, desperately in need of repair. After significant restorations, it reopened for business in November 2018.",clubs racism cocktails colonialism bars abandoned history

It was originally part of the royal palace complex in Amarapura, but was subsequently moved to Mandalay, where it became known as Mya Nan San Kyaw. Following its move, it became the northern section of the Glass Palace and also part of the king’s royal apartments. It would also be the final home and resting place of King Mindon, who died in this structure in 1878. King Mindon’s son Thibaw, who succeeded his father following his death, often used the building as meditation grounds, but became convinced that his father’s spirit still haunted the grounds, so he immediately ordered the building to be dismantled and removed from the Royal City. Over the course of the next 5 years following its dismantling, the building was reconstructed as a monastery and dedicated as a work of merit to the memory of King Mindon. During the latter stages of World War II, the rest of the old Royal Palace within the old Royal City burned as a result of allied bombing of the Japanese encamped in the old Royal Palace. Due to King Thibaw’s superstition and relocating of the building, he had preserved a significant remnant of the Royal Palace. Entrance to Swenandaw Kyunag is included with the Mandalay Archeologic Zone combo ticket, which also includes Atumashi Kyaung, Cultural Museum Mandalay, Kuthodaw Paya, Maharani Paya, Mandalay Palace, Paleik Paya, Mandalay Palace, and the ancient cities Amarapura and Inwa.",cultures and civilizations sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture

In the winter, the water is too shallow for travellers, making the already remote site even more so. Upon disembarking, a visitor will discover a hillside complex containing over 1,600 Buddhist stupas, some of mud and stone, some intricately carved, some gilded with precious metals. While several have been restored, many have been reclaimed by the surrounding jungle and lay partially crumbled, covered in creeping greenery. These structures date from the 14th to the 18th centuries and are typical of Burmese zedi. Like others found across the region, the stupas feature fantastical creatures like chinthe - mythic lion-like beings that protect sacred spaces. These were (and remain) sites for contemplation and meditation and many contain relics inside their bases. The first stupas at Indein were likely commissioned during the reign of King Narapatisithu, although according to legend, it was King Ashoka - the Indian emperor responsible for spreading Buddhism across much of Asia - who first designated this as a site of particular spiritual importance. Hundreds of years later, that distinction is completely obvious. The sea of ornate spires coupled with the view over the lake and surrounding calm lend this spot an unquestionably mystic, reflective air.

Fewer still can be seen driving along the often empty streets.  When these streets include a 20-lane highway which leads to the parliamentary buildings, one could be forgiven for wondering why such a gargantuan road, or the city itself, was necessary. Some reports suggest that the nervous president overseeing the construction of this new capital–for the entire thing was custom-built over an unknown number of years, in previously uninhabited jungle–insisted on the giant boulevard so that it could act as a runway for planes in case of riots. The reasons the government chose to relocate the capital from Rangoon (the previous capital) to a patch of previously uninhabited jungle 200 miles north remains equally unclear. Naypyidaw translates as the “abode of kings” and is six times larger than all of New York City. The project has been explained away as an “act of vanity,” the result of an astrologers warning, and as a way to cement power through sheer scale and geography. Naypydaw has also been described as the world’s largest ghost town. There aren’t many capital cities in the world which boast 20-lane highways and fewer still where it’s possible to lie in the middle of the road and take photos. Regular trains run from Yangon (Rangoon) to Naypyitaw, but from the station onwards, the only way to travel around the sprawling, empty city is by car or taxi.",roads

Located opposite of the Buddhist shrine of Kyauktalon Taung, the reclining Buddha is filled with rooms that showcase dioramas of the teachings of Buddha and a shrine. When visiting the giant Buddha it should be remembered that despite the odd novelty of walking into a giant head, it is still a place of worship, and shoes should be removed before entering the shrine. After almost 15 years of construction, the reclining Buddha is still not complete. In 2012, construction started on a second reclining Buddha opposite the original, with the aim of being built to stand the test of time. The poor concrete construction of the first has left the original with an uncertain future.  The entrance to the reclining Buddha image is located about 100 meters south of the Hindu temple on Yadana Taung on the left hand side of the Mawlamyine-Mudon road as you head towards Mudon.

It’s hard to miss the kaleidoscope of gemstones that gleams from its every inch. The entire pagoda is made from jade. According to Myanmar’s government, it’s the first pagoda in the world constructed solely from the precious stone. It’s a fitting choice of gemstone, as Myanmar produces almost 70 percent of the world’s supply of jadeite, a type of jade. Work on the monumental structure began in 2012 and didn’t finish until 2015. Even before construction started, a jewelry trader named U Soe Naing spent about 25 years collecting and stockpiling all the jade. He had to gather over 11,000 tons of the stones to build the pagoda. A series of chambers for praying and making merit ring the roughly 75-foot-tall structure. The exterior walls are inlaid with arrays of carved amulets, sculpted leaves, and inscriptions. There are also carved jade footprints of Buddha, where devotees and pilgrims can leave monetary donations. In combination with the Jade Market in Mandalay, this is really the best place to see excellent examples of the stone used within the context of Buddhism.

Containing over 8,000 depictions of the Buddha dating back as far as 1750, the Pindaya Cave is a constantly growing gallery of peaceful statuary. Among the immense collection are representations of the holy figure in almost every one of his traditional poses, including a few unique depictions, such as the Buddha with a single seed in his upturned palm which may be evidence that the cave was once used by a small Buddhist cult. The cave extends almost 500 feet into the hillside and is actually just one of three caves in the area, although the other two caves are not open to visitors and are believed to be quite shallow. Before reaching the cave however visitors must pass through the Shwe U Min Pagoda, the entrance to which is guarded by a large spider statue. The massive bug is actually in reference to a local legend that gives the cave its name. The story goes that seven princesses were forced to take refuge in the cave, but were sealed in by a giant spider’s web. They were eventually saved by a prince who killed the spider, and shouted, “Pinku Ya-Pyi!” meaning, “I’ve got the spider!” This would be truncated and elided over the centuries to “Pindaya.” Now every worshipper has a chance to see the spider for themselves.

But the communities around the shores of Taunggyi’s Inle Lake use a different technique to cultivate their crops. Rather than limit themselves to land, they’ve crafted a series of floating gardens that bob atop the water. Around a quarter of the massive freshwater lake—the country’s second largest body of water—is topped with these manmade gardens. Farmers glide between their plots from atop boats, plucking produce from patches of “land” that rise and fall with the currents. Tomatoes are the most prominent crop to come from these unconventional gardens. They’re so successful they make up around 90 percent of the gardens’ yields. Depending on the season, farmers can also harvest beans, cucumbers, flowers, and gourds. Naturally, root vegetables don’t fare so well in such shallow terrain. Creating these tiny islands is no easy task. Farmers must gather clumps of water hyacinth and seagrass and secure them in place with large bamboo poles, which they then stake into the lake’s muddy bottom. They then heap even more layers of seagrass and silt atop the mounds before planting seeds. The practice of farming atop the lake, rather than around it, is thought to have started in the 19th century before intensifying in the 1960s. Though the unusual agriculture has boosted the region’s economy, people have since started to worry that chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and runoff are destroying the lake’s natural ecosystem.",lakes gardens water plants food

One overgrown mansion in the city’s Bahan township is an amalgamation of styles from the area’s multicultural past. Lim Chin Tsong was a merchant from Burma’s Hokkien Chinese community who turned his family’s rice business into a commodities fortune. Between 1917 and 1919, Tsong spent over two million rupees constructing an ornate villa blending Chinese and European architectural styles, with Burmese teak and Italian marble side by side. But in 1921, Tsong’s business suffered a major setback when the government banned the export of rice. He died just a few years later in 1924, and his estate was declared insolvent. The palace was home to the All Burma Broadcasting Station while the country was under Japanese control beteen 1941 and 1945, and after Burmese independence, it became the Kanbawza Yeiktha hotel in 1951. Myanmar’s Ministry of Culture took over the top floors in the 1950s and has maintained an art school there since, but maintenance has been neglected; the palace is just too big and frequent rain has abraded the old building. The building features the grand staircases, foyers, and columns of a European mansion alongside dougongs (interlocking brackets common in Chinese temples) and murals of the Great Wall by English painters Dod and Ernest Procter. The pagoda-like octagonal five-story tower, rising incongruously above a nearby highway overpass, provides a 360-degree view of the city’s rapidly rising skyline.

However, its infamous place in the history books comes from eye witness reports of an animals-gone-wild style massacre during World War II. According to historical interviews, anywhere between 500 to 1,000 retreating Japanese soldiers were devoured by a large infestation of saltwater crocodiles as the troops entered the marshes and mangroves that surround Ramree. Only around 20 of the men emerged to be captured by the pursuing forces. The survivors immediately began spewing tales of reptilian monsters, horrible screams, and agonizing death.  Due to a fair amount of press corroboration of the military tragedy, Ramree has the distinct honor of being host to the “Greatest Disaster Suffered by Humans Due to Animals” in the Guinness Book of World Records. Local residents dispute the legends of the frenzied feast that haunt their island to this day, but it is true that the highly territorial saltwater crocodiles do still live in alarming numbers around Ramree Island and they are not picky eaters.

There’s evidence that in previous centuries, similar architectural gems were widespread throughout Myanmar, but fire, conflict, pests, and natural elements conspired to erase most of them. With the odds stacked against it, it’s a marvel that this monastery has survived to this day. Nat Taung Kyaung is not far from Old Bagan. There’s no consensus as to the exact date of its construction, but the most credible estimates claim it’s more than 200 years old. It’s important to note that Nat Taung Kyaung is not a temple, but a monastery. Most temples were built using stones, bricks, and stucco, but Nat Taung Kyaung, like most other monasteries from its era, is made of wood, a humbler material leading to a limited life expectancy. But as vulnerable as the material may be, Nat Taung Kyaung was built with teak and padauk wood, which, though not as durable as stone or bricks, is still extremely strong and humidity-resistant. In line with the Burmese architectural tradition, Nat Taung Kyaung exhibits a number of towers with multilayered roofs (pyatthat) and it sits on a wooden platform that forms its base. The intricate carvings decorating the various elements of the monastery have been weathered by the elements, but they still survive as a testimony to the craftsmanship of the artisans that sculpted them.

91,Nesting Turtles of Wa Ale Island,"Kawthaung, Myanmar (Burma)",How often do you find security guards patrolling tropical beaches to protect rare sea turtles from poachers?,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wa-ale-island-nesting-turtles,"Wa Ale Island is a secluded tropical island in the Mergui Archipelago, a group of over 800 islands off the southern coast of Myanmar. As part of the country’s only marine protected area, the Lampi Marine National Park, this small island is home to a number of rare nesting sea turtles, who lay their eggs each season on its sandy beaches just a few feet from the island’s back-to-nature eco-resort. The nesting turtle site is thanks to a unique collaboration between the Myanmar government and a private venture that created a conservation-led tourism project. Those that make it to this remote island will see guards protecting the sand dunes where sea turtles come up each full moon of the season to lay their eggs. The resident security guard often is stationed by a river platform where the trees hide camouflaged python snakes, wrapped around the trees, sleeping. It is estimated that more than 4,000 green, hawksbill, and leatherback turtles have been saved as a result of the initiative.  An e-visa is needed to venture into the Mergui Archipelago and prior to booking a stay at the small Wa Ale eco-resort.",turtles resorts wildlife sanctuaries environment beaches conservation places to stay islands
92,Minbu Mud Volcanoes,"Minbu, Myanmar (Burma)",These muddy eruptions are less deadly than actual volcanoes but also more holy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/minbu-mud-volcanoes,"The rare geological occurrence of mud volcanoes are always a sight to behold, and the fields of bubbling liquid dirt in the small town of Minbu are no exception. Mud volcanoes are formed from methane gases trapped deep below the ground being forced to the surface. In some instances the pressure will push through the water table and mix with the clay or mud in the surrounding areas to create a “volcano” such as the ones found in Minbu. Unlike regular volcanoes, there is no heating involved and in fact, the mud is cool to the touch. The landscape is in Minbu looks like the surface of the moon (if the satellite had active geology) with multiple vents bubbling out of ever-growing craters in the ground. The area is revered as a religious site by the locals who hold the tradition that the volcanoes are powered by dragons deep within the earth. Visitors to the Minbu mud volcanoes are required to remove their shoes when they visit, but these volcanic surroundings aren’t about to burn anyone’s feet. Travelling from nearby Magway, find a motorcycle taxi who can help with a return journey. This will cost 6,000 kyat return per person. The journey will take you across the Arrawaddy River by the newly constructed bridge. Within 15 minutes you will arrive at the main entrance to the Mud Volcanoes.",mud volcanoes martian landscapes volcanoes geological oddities ecosystems geology
93,Atumashi Monastery,"Mandalay, Myanmar (Burma)",This Buddhist monastery once housed an image of Buddha containing a 19-carat diamond.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atumashi-monastery,"With an enormous single prayer hall inside, Atumashi Monastery is also known as the “Incomparable Monastery,” due to its sheer size. Atumashi Monastery is considered one of the largest religious buildings in Mandalay. The gigantic gold and white monastery was constructed by King Mindon in 1857. The monastery was once home to an image of Buddha that contained a massive diamond. The diamond was brought by the Governor of Rakhine from western Burma and presented to King Bodawpaya. However, in 1885, the diamond was lost during the British takeover of Mandalay and was never seen again. After the event of the lost diamond, the British seized control of the monastery in 1890 and turned it into a military barrack. However, this didn’t last long as the monastery was destroyed by a fire. Only the stairways and pillars underneath survived the disaster. A century after the mysterious fire, renovations to the monastery begun around 1990 and ended in 1996, salvaging a fragment of the city’s rich history.  Located east of the Shwenandaw Monastery, Atumashi Monastery is reachable from a narrow road leading to both monasteries.",monasteries religion sacred spaces history & culture architecture
94,Shwethalyaung Buddha of Bago,"Bago, Myanmar (Burma)","The second largest reclining Buddha in the world got ""lost"" for over 120 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shwethalyaung-buddha,"One thinks it would be hard to lose the second largest reclining Buddha in the world. Apparently that would be wrong. Believed to have been built in 994, the Shwethalyaung Buddha is huge, at 180 feet long and 52 feet high. However after a 1757 pillaging of the area, the world lost track fo the Buddha, only to have a British railway engineer accidentally rediscover it, completely overgrown with jungle, in 1880. The Buddha was given a giant mosiac pillow in 1930, and is currently kept under a rather unattractive enormous shed. A number of other giant Buddhas can be found throughout Bago, however the Shwethalyaung Buddha is the oldest and most revered.",giant buddhas statues
95,Boulder Island,"Nga Khin Nyo Gyee Island, Myanmar (Burma)",This remote island known for its balancing boulder may have inspired Peter Pan's Neverland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boulder-island,"The most remote and far-out island in the Mergui Archipelago, Nga Khin Nyo Gyee Island, or “Boulder Island,” is known for the rounded boulder curiously perched atop another rock off the coast of the bay. The iconic balancing rock sits on a tidal platform amid a coral reef garden in the aptly named Boulder Bay. In between the rocky headlands, white sands stretch across the bay, forming a picture-perfect tropical island scene. Only recently opened to foreigners, the over-800 islands of the Mergui Archipelago were once the domain of pirates, and the archipelago has suffered from plundering and pillaging throughout its past. Closed following Burma’s independence and designated “out-of-bounds” during the decades of military rule, it is only in the last few years that intrepid visitors have been allowed back into the island group, which sits in the Andaman Sea off the coast of southern Myanmar. The archipelago is now a sought-after dive destination, featuring mega-fauna such as sharks, whale sharks, and dugongs, and it is sometimes regarded as the last island frontier. Boulder Island is the outermost island of the group, which helps to explain its other claim to fame: that it may have inspired the mythical faraway island of Neverland in J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan. A handful of eco-resorts have opened up recently on Boulder Island, offering low-impact, high-immersion experiences, including conservation projects showcasing the unique environment of the island.  To visit Boulder Island, you need to have an evisa for Myanmar, around $50 USD, and to arrange in advance your trip out to the island, where Boulder Bay Eco Resort is based. There are weekly scheduled departures from Kawthaung in Myanmar, across the estuary from Ranong in Thailand. Another way to visit the archipelago is aboard the Sea Gipsy on Island Safaris, which calls into Boulder Island on its itinerary. Island access is restricted to booked guests and those on approved itineraries.",marine ecology literature rocks islands geology
96,Gokteik Viaduct,"Nawnghkio, Myanmar (Burma)",The highest bridge in Myanmar was once the tallest railway bridge in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gokteik-viaduct,"The Gokteik Viaduct is a vertigo-inducing steel railway bridge that spans a deep river gorge. Built in 1899 and officially opened in 1901, the bridge was constructed as part of the Mandalay to Lashio railway line into Northern Shan State, aimed at expanding the British Empire’s influence in Myanmar. The viaduct is located in the center of the country, about 60 miles northeast of Mandalay. It measures 689 meters (2,261 feet) long and it is built atop 14 towers that rise up to 102 meters (335 feet) above the gorge. At the time of its construction, the bridge was the tallest railway bridge in the world and was considered to be an engineering marvel. It was designed in London, and the pieces were manufactured by the Pennsylvania Steel Company. Pieces of the structure were built in the United States and then loaded onto ships for the months-long journey from New York to Southeast Asia. Just under a year after the pieces arrived, the bridge was assembled. American writer Paul Theroux’s describes the viaduct as “a monster of silver geometry in all the ragged rock and jungle” in his 1975 book The Great Railway Bazaar. Trains still run over this bridge every day, the steel towers suspending riders above the deep ravine.  The trains run once per day in each direction. Total journey time between Mandalay to Lashio exceeds 15 hours. Upper class fares for the full journey is about $6, less for shorter journeys. The main towns served by this train are Mandalay and Pyin U Lwin south of the viaduct, and Hsipaw and Lashio north of the viaduct. For Northbound Trains: The viaduct is north of Mandalay and Pyin U Lwin. Take the train from either of those stations. It is best to sit on the left side of the train in this direction. Tickets sellers usually assign upper class seats on the left side without asking. For Southbound Trains: The two largest towns north of the viaduct are Hsipaw and Lashio. It is best to sit on the right side of the train in this direction. Tickets sellers usually assign upper class seats on the left side without asking. Ticket sales begin at the stations one hour before scheduled departure. Foreigners must produce their passports to purchase a ticket.",engineering colonialism railroads trains bridges
97,Rih Dil,Myanmar (Burma),This heart-shaped lake near the border of India and Myanmar is deeply rooted in Mizo folklore.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rih-dil-lake,"Mizoram, a state in Northeast India, shares a border with Myanmar and Bangladesh, and is renowned for its dense forest cover and the diverse tribal origins of its population. The Mizo people are an ethnic group indigenous to Mizoram and its surrounding areas, which includes parts of Myanmar and Bangladesh. Rih Dil is a heart-shaped lake (word Dil means Heart) deeply rooted in Mizo history, culture, and folklores. According to the Mizo customs, newlywed couples visit the lake to seek blessing and pray for a long marriage. Mizo ancestral tribes also consider the Rih Dil Lake as the gateway to Pialral, or “beyond the world.” It is believed that all souls destined to Pialral must pass through the lake. In Mizo folklore, the formation of Rih Dil was tied to a young girl by the name of Rih-i. She had a cruel stepmother, who convinced Rih-i’s father to get rid of her and her younger sister. Their father killed the younger girl by cutting off her head. When Rih-i found her sister, she was heartbroken. The desolate girl was spotted by a fairy who inquired about her sadness. Upon hearing her story, the fairy asked Rih-i to go to the forest and find a branch with only one leaf. The fairy showed Rih-i how to use the leaf to revive her sister. When her sister was thirsty, Rih-i took used the magic leaf again to transform herself into a stream. Today, the place where Rih-i changed herself into the water came to be known as Rih Dil. Although Rih-Dil Lake has so much cultural and historical importance in Mizoram, the lake doesn’t actually lie in the state. Before the India-Myanmar Border was carved out, the lake was in India, but today it lies four kilometers (2.5 miles) over the border in Myanmar. But Indian citizens can easily visit the lake—the free movement policy allows citizens on the India-Myanmar border to visit the neighboring countries without any visa restrictions. This enables the Mizo community to visit Rih Dil no matter which country they live in. The trading post of Zokthawar is the nearest town to Rih Dil, and Aizwal, the capital of Mizoram, is located some 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the lake. Visiting Rih Dil Lake is a memorable experience that showcases the pristine beauty of the region.  Visiting Rih Dil requires a lot of patience as the roads are in very bad shape. Visiting lake in the monsoon seasons further increases the trouble as the region receives some of the highest rainfall in the country. The best time to visit the lake is the post-monsoon season when the entire area gets covered under a green blanket of vegetation. Also, carry mosquito repellent while visiting during or post-monsoon season.",hearts folklore borders indigenous lakes water
