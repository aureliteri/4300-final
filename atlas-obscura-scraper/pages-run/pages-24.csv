0,H.R. Giger Museum,"Gruyères, Switzerland","The bizarre visions of H.R. Giger, tucked away in a Swiss medieval city.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hr-giger-museum,"In the quaint medieval city of Gruyères, Switzerland, you may meander the cobblestone streets, visit a 13th Century Chateau and take in the stunning valley panoramas from the historic rampart walls. But a far more fascinating site here contrasts with the Swiss scenery and piques the modern curiosity. Along the way to the fromagerie is the H.R. Giger Museum. Even if the name H. R. Giger doesn’t mean anything to you, chances are you are familiar with his best known creation. H. R. Giger is the mind behind the titular monsters from the Alien movie franchise, among many other works frightening works of art. Swiss-born, Giger fell in love with the village at an exhibition there in the 1990s, and now the town’s medieval walls house his museum dedicated to his art, it contains the world’s largest collection of his works. The Museum’s interior was designed entirely by Giger himself. The Museum is intentionally dark, grim, and slightly disturbing: stepping inside feels like entering an alien’s lair. His oeuvre is available for view, including paintings, drawings, even furniture. The disparity between bucolic Switzerland and the obsessive, bizarre works of Giger will lend a Surreal tint to a day spent in Gruyères. While you’re in the area, be sure to visit the Museum’s HR Giger Bar open 10:00-8:30 daily, opposite the museum. The ceiling is like the inside of a ribcage, with vertebrae twisting along its vaulted ceiling. A beautiful panoramic photograph of the museum can be seen at the museum’s website. From Zurich HB (main train station) it’s an easy two and a half-hour trip to Gruyères, first to Fribourg, then a second change of trains in Bulle. There you can catch the RegioExpress towards Montbovon for the last 20-minutes to Gruyeres. From Geneva, it's about the same distance as from Zurich, it’s a lovely run along Lake Geneva to Montreux. There, you can catch a classic Swiss hill-climbing train to Montbovon. There, a ride on the RegioExpress train to Gruyeres (direction Broc Fabrique) is a total of two and a half hours of breathtaking scenery, particularly the hill climb out of Montreux.",science fiction museums and collections art museums
1,Berggasthaus Aescher Wildkirchli,"Wasserauen, Switzerland",This 170-year-old Swiss guesthouse built into the side of a mountain is best accessed by a cable car.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berggasthaus-aescher-wildkirchli,"This gorgeous guesthouse and restaurant is quite literally built into a cliff, and its back wall is made up of the rock itself. Its precarious perch makes it difficult to get to, and it’s only accessible after a steep hike along a mountain path or via cable car (the piano in the living room was brought in by helicopter). It’s been around for 170 years, and was originally a home for farmers; the guestbook goes back to 1940. Open from May through November, the guesthouse uses only rainwater, and there are no showers. Weekends often bring in rowdy groups of Swiss hikers and live music that plays late into the night. It’s run by Claudia and Beny Knechtle-Wyss and their five children, plus it’s home to 35 sheep, 20 rabbits, 5 chickens, 3 pigs, a donkey, and a dog. The guesthouse (which no longer accepts guests and is now only a restaurant) is also just a short distance down the path from the Wildkirchli caves, which were inhabited by Neanderthals as far back as 40,000 years ago.  The caves later became the site of a hermitage. Take the Wasserauen-Ebenalp cable car. It costs 27 CHF per person for a roundtrip.",places to stay mountains restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars houses homes architectural oddities architecture
2,Hammetschwand Elevator,"Ennetbürgen, Switzerland",The tallest outdoor elevator in Europe rockets passengers on a dizzyingly precarious ride to the top of a mountain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hammetschwand-elevator,"Straddling the exposed rock face of Switzerland’s Mt. Bürgenstock is the towering Hammetschwand Elevator, the tallest outdoor lift in Europe, which shoots passengers from an underground boarding station into an open-air shaft leading to the top of the mountain in less than a minute. The Hammetschwand Lift was put into place to carry visitors over 3,700 foot above sea level to the beautiful vistas of Lake Lucerne. Created in 1905 by a popular hotel destination nearby, the elevator has survived both world wars, the elements, and a wood-to-steel conversion to remain a world-record holding attraction. Originally the precarious elevator compartment was made of nothing more than wood and sheet metal which would be drawn up the 500 foot shaft, which was constructed of equally questionable materials. At the time, the ride took up to three minutes to complete. Today, after multiple overhauls, the elevator is made of expertly engineered metal and glass, yet somehow looks nonetheless rickety. In addition to the hair-raising heights that the glass-walled elevator reaches, the speed of the lift has also been increased and riders are now shot to the top of the shaft in less than a minute. The station at the top exits unto a bridge that leads to the mountaintop. Despite the sense of danger, the quick ride along the mountainside provides one of the most scenic views in all of the Swiss Alps, assuring that people will continue taking this ride for one hundred more years to come.",elevators mountains
3,Saut de Brot,"Boudry, Switzerland",This lovely little bridge hidden in a Switzerland gorge is essentially a fairytale.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saut-de-brot,"Tucked away near the bottom of Switzerland’s Areuse Gorge is a nearly fantastical little bridge that looks straight out of a storybook. Of course the Saut de Brot, as it is known, is very real, and absolutely gorgeous. The lush Areuse Gorge in the region of Brot-Dessous in Switzerland was carved over millennia by what is now the Areuse river. The waters still rush along the bottom of the beautiful natural fissure, between tall walls of stone. The gorge is a popular nature spot for hikers who can traverse the trail that hugs the rocky cliffs. However, maybe the most stunning feature is the small bridge that was built to span the Areuse between the canyon walls. Known as the Saut de Brot, the bridge is a simple stone arch that is not overly dramatic in its construction, but is nonetheless singular enough to create an almost fantastical scene like something out of a Tolkien novel or a fairytale. Greenery grows above and around the bridge giving it an even more hidden and secluded feel, even with other hikers and visitors milling around. The actual origins of the bridge are unclear, although it seems like a recent addition despite the stone construction. It was obviously not built by elves, but it almost seems like it could have been. The hike to the bridge is easy and stunning. You can choose your entry point and decide whether you want to go on a simple, hour-long walk or whether you want to make a three-hour hike (there are also options in between). If you start at the train station in Noiraigue you have all options open.",bridges
4,St. Beatus Cave,"Beatenberg, Switzerland",Caves famous for the dragon-slaying saint who lived there.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-beatus-cave,"The legend of the cave revolves around its namesake, St. Beatus, a monk living around 100 AD, who chose the cave in which to spend his pious hermitage. To his annoyance, however, he discovered someone was already living there; a horrible dragon, who shot lasers of fire from his blazing eyes. St. Beatus, however, would not be run out of his cave so easily, and held his cross up to the beast, invoking the Holy Trinity. Thrown into a hysteric fit, the dragon ran down the cliff and threw himself into Lake Thun below, causing the placid clear water to rise and boil. So the legend goes. Like the Alps once were, the St. Beatus Cave is largely unexplored, but a small portion is open to the public. The setting of the cave is reason to visit alone - the beautiful old fashioned Swiss-style building that serves as the cave entrance clings to a vertical rock face. A waterfall seems to leak from beneath the structure, and into Lake Thun below. Bridges and walkways cross the waterfall, and as one climbs to the top, each vista is more inspiring than the last. The cave tour includes many charmingly named stalactites and stalagmites, and a number of underground waterfalls and lakes. Back in the light of day, a visit to the small museum is rewarded with cave bear artifacts discovered within Beatus, and a history of the dangers and delights of caving. For children and any with a fascination of the mystique of dragons, the Fable House is full of displays on dragons throughout history and Bernese Oberland legends.  By car: From Bern - Head for Thun; take the Thun North [Thun Nord] exit -Head for Gunten/lnterlaken From the Brünig - Take the A8 in the direction of Interlaken - Take the Gunten/Unterseen lane in the Rugen tunnel - Head for Gunten/Thun By bus: For information see www.stibus.ch By boat: For information see www.bls.ch/schiff Make sure to bring warm clothing as it can be surprisingly cold inside the caves, even in summer",subterranean sites caves ecosystems
5,The Child Eater of Bern,"Bern, Switzerland","A nearly 500-year-old sculpture depicts a man eating a sack of babies, and no one is sure why.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/child-eater-bern,"Standing in the middle of Bern, Switzerland, is the Kindlifresser, or “Child Eater.” The fountain sculpture towers above the ground, a baby half stuffed into the giant’s mouth, and a sack full of three alarmed tots slung over his shoulder presumably for later snacking. The unsettling sculpture is no modern work of art; built in 1546, it is one of the oldest fountains in the city of Bern. Strangely, no one is exactly sure why it’s there. There are three main theories. The first and most unfortunate possibility is that the Kindlifresser was built as a sort of warning to the Jewish community of Bern. The Kindlifresser wears a hat that is strikingly similar to the yellow pointed Judenhut that Jews were forced to wear at that time. The second theory is that the terrifying Ogre is a depiction of Kronos, the Greek Titan. Kronos has arguably one of the most disturbing tales in Greek Mythology. Long story short, Kronos eats all his god children to keep them from taking over his throne. The final theory is that the Kindlifresser is supposed to be the older brother of Duke Berchtold, the founder of Bern. Apparently the jealousy of being overshadowed by his younger brother for so many years caused him to go mad, eventually sending him into a rage where he collected and ate the town’s children. (It would seem likely that this event would have been recorded in the town’s history books, which it is not.) It may of course be none of the above, and is simply a sort of boogie man from Switzerland’s Fastnacht, or ”Night of Fasting” festival, a way to remind the children of Bern to behave. Whatever the Kindlifresser represents, it has terrified Swiss children for nearly 500 years, and hopefully, will be there to terrify them for 500 years more.",fountains memento mori monuments statues
6,Trift Bridge,"Gadmen, Switzerland",This amazing pedestrian suspension bridge in the Swiss Alps would give Indiana Jones nightmares.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trift-bridge,"Stretching over an arm of Lake Triftsee (itself a product of the Trift glacier), hidden among the high Swiss Alps, the Trift Bridge is a thin modern suspension bridge that looks like it could blow over with one stray wind, but is in fact quite safe. Originally built in 2004, the bridge was replaced in 2009. The first bridge was constructed to allow workers from the Trift hydroelectric plant to access a power plant that was built below the glacier to collect and use the run off. A few short years after the original bridge was built, the second, sturdier model was hung across the wide ravine and the site was opened to the public. Currently the bridge spans a vertigo-inducing almost 560 foot gap in the mountains, suspended over 300 feet from the valley floor. Unlike some of its more primitive inspirations, the Trift bridge is made of thick steel cables over which wooden planks have been bolted. Despite the modern construction it still looks like a death trap. While the bridge itself is an impressive site to visit, the journey to span is harrowing in and of itself requiring a cable car trip, which also carries visitors high above the ground.  It's best to buy tickets up the cable car as early as possible during the day, as they can sell out both ways, or just for the ride back down. While it is possible to hike back down without taking the cable car, the journey is an extra two hour hike.",bridges architectural oddities architecture

8,Abbey Library of Saint Gall,"St. Gallen, Switzerland","This is not only one of the oldest collections in Europe, but also possibly the most beautiful.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abbey-library-of-saint-gall-2,"There are beautiful old libraries, and then there is the Abbey Library of Saint Gall, which may not only be one of the oldest surviving libraries in Europe, but certainly one of the most beautiful. According to the Abbey of Saint Gall’s website (Abtei St. Gallen in German), the earliest evidence of a library collection on the site dates back to around 820 CE, in plans that show a library attached to the main church. The Abbey is said to have followed the Rule of St. Benedict, a portion of which prescribes the study of literature, should a library be available, so it is no wonder that the abbey itself would have been built with one. As the abbey grew over the years, so did its library, and soon the site became known for its collection of illuminated manuscripts and writings, as well as a leading center for science and Western culture around the 10th century. In the mid-18th century, the world-renowned collection was moved to a new library space which was lavishly decorated in a Baroque rococo style. Elaborate artworks were installed in the ceiling which was framed by flowing, curved moldings, giving the space a timeless and fantastical aspect. The wooden balconies are shaped into flowering shapes and designs. Oh, and the books from the historic collection are also on display if you can look past their surroundings to pay attention to them. Today the library at St. Gall is still considered nearly unrivaled in its beauty. It also now holds one of the more important collections in the world, covering 12 centuries of non-stop collecting. The collection even includes the first example of an architectural plan on parchment. But take your nose out of that book and revel in one of the most stunning libraries ever.  Before you go, be aware that cameras are not allowed into the library, and photographs of any kind are not allowed (including photos taken on cell phones.

9,Lion of Lucerne,"Lucerne, Switzerland",This memorial commemorating fallen Swiss Guards of the French Revolution has been called the saddest stone in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lion-of-lucerne,"Created to remember the hundreds of Swiss Guards who were massacred during the French Revolution, the Lion of Lucerne was emotionally evocative enough to garner the attention of none other than Mark Twain. Carved directly into the wall of a former sandstone quarry in Lucerne, the titular lion statue sees the regal beast dying from a spear wound which is marked by a shield bearing the mark of the French monarchy. The remarkably large monument was etched from the stone in 1820 and measures a remarkable ten meters in length and six meters in height. Above the mournful lion is the inscription, “HELVETIORUM FIDEI AC VIRTUTI,” which is Latin for “To the loyalty and bravery of the Swiss,” and below the lion’s niche is a list of some of the deceased officers’ names. In his 1880 travelogue, A Tramp Abroad, American author and noted satirist Mark Twain described the monument as “the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world.” The lifeless eyes of the Lion of Lucerne may not be able to cry, but the endless tragedy in its gaze still inspires more than its share of tears.",literature military history monuments sculptures military statues
10,Sphinx Observatory,"Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland","A historic observatory precariously perched at the ""Top of Europe.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sphinx-observatory,"Scientists have long traveled to Earth’s ends to conduct their studies. Mountaintops are a classic example of a harsh environment that serves as an ideal setting for experiments ranging from the physiological to the astronomical. When the Jungfraujoch station in Switzerland’s Bernese Alps opened in 1912, it became the highest railway stop in all of Europe. It also opened the door for eager scientists awaiting easy access to a high altitude site to do their work. The Sphinx Observatory, completed in 1937, is a result of this influx of research. Perched on a shockingly steep precipice at the so-called “Top of Europe,” the observatory is the highest-altitude construction in the entire continent. With multiple laboratories, a weather observation station, astronomical and meteorological domes, and a 76-cm telescope, the Sphinx has served as a headquarters for researchers in fields such as glaciology, medicine, cosmic ray physics, and astronomy. And over the years, the building has adapted to meet scientists’ needs. Today, the observatory is fully outfitted with electricity, water, telephone, internet, and even a machine to produce liquid air. In addition to the science, the observatory also provides visitors with vertigo-inducing, panoramic views of the snowy Alps, green valleys, and the Great Aletsch Glacier. From the metal grating terrace that surrounds the building, one can see over 11,000 feet below, with views stretching as far as Germany and Italy. Even getting to the observatory is a wondrous journey itself. Riding along the historic Jungfrau railway, passengers have a chance to peer through windows built into the mountainside and browse the peculiar Eispalast (Ice Palace), where ice sculptures depicting everything from people to automobiles are carved within a chilly glacier.  The Jungfraujoch station is serviced by the Jungfrau railway, which can be boarded in the city of Interlaken.",telescopes cliffs observatories astronomy instruments of science mountains
11,Stoosbahn Funicular,"Schwyz, Switzerland",The steepest classic funicular in the world glides along a dizzying incline.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stoosbahn-funicular,"The world’s steepest classic funicular whisks passengers up and down a mountainside along a jaw-dropping 110 percent incline. From its base, it zooms skyward along the dizzyingly steep gradient, gliding through a blend of open air and tunnels before emerging at a quaint car-free village. The Stoosbahn is a wondrous feat of engineering. Riders can climb inside one of its four barrels, where they’re treated to panoramic views of the surroundings. The futuristic cylinders rotate throughout the ride, slowly turning in a way that resembles the movement of beer barrels lined up one after another. This allows passenger cars to remain horizontal throughout their four-minute journey, even as the funicular tilts on its tracks along the slope. The funicular opened in December, 2017, after 14 years of planning and building to replace its 84-year-old predecessor. It begins in Schwyz and ends in Stoos, a small alpine village perched atop a peak that boasts stunning views of region’s mountains and lakes. As the village is car-free, the funicular is the best way to reach it. Because of the difficult terrain, construction workers faced multiple setbacks before finally bringing the innovative railway to life. Despite the difficult geography, officials still pushed for the funicular; an aerial gondola would be a poor substitute because the route passes through an active shooting range. Thankfully, they realized the prospect of possibly peppering passengers with stray bullets was a terrible idea.",funicular engineering railroads trains transportation
12,CERN,"Geneva, Switzerland",Large Hadron Collider and the Birthplace of World Wide Web.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cern,"Tucked away in the peaceful Swiss countryside, deep under fields of wildflowers and quiet suburbs at the foot of the Jura mountains, lies a place that should have a special spot in the heart of every STEM lover. Founded in 1954 to coordinate the research efforts of 12 European countries, CERN – short for the European Organization for Nuclear Research – is the world’s largest (and arguably) most expensive physics lab, home to an array of impressive machinery including several particle accelerators. The biggest of these is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a hollow donut 17 miles (27 km) in circumference buried hundreds of feet underground. Using electromagnets, scientists suspend subatomic particles inside the colliders, then spin them around at ever-increasing speeds, sometimes up to 80 percent of the speed of light. They then smash the particles together. Via Einstein’s theory of mass-energy equivalence, the force of the collisions creates new particles, which fling in every direction and are recorded by sensors. By examining the sensor data, CERN scientists can deduce insights into the Big Bang and the makeup of stars, and even discover new particles, such as the Higgs boson in 2013, the existence of which had previously been strictly theoretical. Yet the singular CERN invention that has transformed the planet didn’t involve atom smashing. By the late 1980s, universities and science centers like CERN digitally communicated with each other over vast distances via telecom lines, but using this early Internet was often tedious and crude. In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at CERN, proposed the HTTP protocol, which when combined with the existing telecom network and hypertext protocol, gave birth to the visual point-and-click system we call the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee is also credited with designing the first web browser. Today, the WWW is regarded as an afterthought at CERN, with only small references to it in their public exhibits. CERN has two exhibitions open to the public, the Globe of Science and Innovation and the Microcosm exhibit. Individual and group tours are also offered Monday through Saturday in English and French, although slots for the individual tours open 15 days beforehand and fill up very, very fast. The individual tours involve a visit to ATLAS, one of the experiments located along the LHC where you can see the scientists at work, and a stop at the decommissioned Synchrocyclotron, CERN’s first accelerator built in 1957.

13,The Reichenbach Falls,"Schattenhalb, Switzerland",The alpine falls where Sherlock Holmes apparently met his demise can actually be visited.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-reichenbach-falls-schattenhalb-switzerland,"Whilst there are some waterfalls in the world, such as the Niagara and the Victoria, that draw thousands of tourists each year to marvel at their natural wonder, there is one hidden away in the alps of Switzerland that looms large in the discerning reader’s psyche: the notorious Reichenbach Falls. For it was here that marked the final and deadly confrontation between Sherlock Holmes and his arch nemesis, the Napoleon of Crime, Professor Moriarty. First published in the Strand magazine in 1893, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle decided to kill off his infamous alter ego in a short story called The Final Problem. His opponent was the nefarious Moriarty, a shadowy figure responsible for organizing all the evil, undetected crimes in London. A fight to the death between the two intellectual equals saw them plunge to their doom in the Reichenbach Falls. The story might have been fiction, but the location was very much real. Doyle was visiting Switzerland as a guest of Sir Henry Lunn, who would go on to found one of England’s first major travel agency companies, Lunn Poly. Visiting the haunting beauty of the Reichenbach Falls, Doyle was given the inspiration for the venue in which to kill off his famous detective. In The Final Problem Doyle describes the falls as a “fearful place…a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house.” By 1893, Doyle had tired of Holmes’ celebrity; he’s quoted as saying, “I have had such an overdose of Holmes that I feel towards him as I do toward pâté de foie gras, of which I once ate too much, so that the name of it gives me a sickly feeling to this day.” Wanting to pursue what he saw as more serious writing, he told his mother, “I must save my mind for better things, even if it means I must bury my pocketbook with him.” But Holmes was to die in glory; vanquishing the wicked Moriarty by sacrificing himself, and sending them both plunging into the chasms of the Falls. But following Holmes’ apparent death, there was large scale public outcry in England. Eventually Doyle relented and restored Sherlock to his adoring fans in the 1902 novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Today, intrepid explorers can retrace Sherlock Holmes’ footsteps by taking a funicular railway to the falls high in the Swiss Alps. There, a pathway and bridge lead to a trail where the infamous narrow ledge is still there today. A small plaque marks the spot where,”at this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty on 4th May 1891.”",rivals week waterfalls literature water

So in 1230 a wooden bridge was constructed, and while that is now long gone and two bridges have been built to take its place, these have all guarded the title of Teufelsbrücke, or Devil’s Bridge. Occult legends aside, crossing that 13th century bridge was likely terrifying on its own as it shook several hundred feet over the water, or got terrifying close to the water when the river was full. The wooden bridge was heavily damaged in the Napoleonic Wars and later replaced in the 1820s, a structure that still stands alongside another more sturdy bridge built in the 1950s. All are rather frightening to drive over for their height in the Swiss mountains. So where does the devil come in? Well, it’s said that in the 13th century the villagers from nearby Andermatt found it to be an impossible task and enlisted the help of the devil. As it goes with getting a devil architect, he demanded the soul of the first to cross. The townspeople sent a scared goat over to outwit him. Enraged, the devil grabbed a massive stone and was about to destroy the bridge when an old woman with a cross stopped him and he dropped it. The stone is actually still around near Göschenen, although it had to be relocated for a rather huge sum of money in 1977 for a new highway. More likely is that a bridge at such height over the raging river is just unsettling in itself, but for good measure someone once added a couple of painted frolicking devils to the tunnel at its opposite side.",devils bridge bridges architectural oddities architecture

But as the glacier receded, so did its number of visitors. Since the end of the 19th century, when the Furka Pass road was built, tourists have flocked to the hotel for its panoramic views over the icy landscape. The glacier was once only a 600-foot walk from the hotel and a 300-foot long grotto carved into the glacier allowed guests to journey inside. Sadly, the Rhône Glacier has lost almost a full mile of coverage in the last 100 years or so. The 11,000-year-old glacier has been known to recede as much as 10 centimeters in a day, and consistently loses about 130 feet a year. The grotto, which dates back to as early as 1894, can no longer be securely carved into the dwindling ice. Hotel Belvédère, which once hosted party-goers and adventurers, and even the likes of Pope John XXIII and Sean Connery, has seen better days. As the glacier moves farther away from the pass, fewer people visit. Though the hotel makes a brief appearance in Goldfinger, it is closed indefinitely. Drivers still stop to take pictures of the building and its mountainous backdrop. The building now sits with its doors and windows boarded up, a testament to the passage of time and climate change.",glaciers climate change hotels

The gable-roofed bridge was built in the 13th century to connect a group of mill buildings to the mainland. During its initial usage the bridge was unique in that the mill workers could simply dump their waste into the river since they were so far downstream. The wooden bridge survived for hundreds of years retaining its peaked medieval style. Then in the mid-1600s it was decided that the bridge would be spruced up a bit and a project was spearheaded to create a series of artworks forming a Dance of Death cycle, also known as a “Danse Macabre” or “Totentanz” in German. The object of such works was to remind everyone that death comes for us all, whether old or young, rich or poor. In the end 67 separate works were painted in the rafters of the covered bridge each featuring at least one skeletal harbinger of death (more often a number of them) coming to drag people to the afterlife. Monks, knights, nuns, and beggars are all seen being taken by death no matter their life. Walks along covered rustic bridges are often symbolic of peaceful times of beauty, relaxation, and simple living, but the Spreuer Bridge really makes sure that people know they need to enjoy it while it lasts, which probably won’t be that much longer no matter who you are.",paintings death bridges art
17,Cabaret Voltaire: the Dada House,"Zurich, Switzerland",One hundred years ago this small house in downtown Zürich became the birthplace of the Dada movement.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cabaret-voltaire-dada-house,"In July 1916 German artist and poet Hugo Ball stood in the tiny performance space at Zurich’s Cabaret Voltaire, and read the first Manifesto introducing the world to a new concept in thought and culture. This was Dada: “An International word. Just a word, and the word a movement.” Ball, along with his wife Emmy Hennings and half a dozen other Dadaists like Tristan Tzara and Jean Arp, opened the small café, gallery and salon as a showcase for the burgeoning, unruly movement. In the process they began a new chapter in Western cultural history. It was here in the Spiegelgasse that the group played piano, danced and performed new forms of poetry. They exhibited art, argued, sang and railed against the war—often in outlandish, stylized costume. With Switzerland neutral during World War I, Zürich had become a haven for artists, philosophers, scientists and writers. Political exiles from all parts of Europe and Russia came, including Vladimir Lenin, who lived near the Cabaret at the time. Some say he was known to drop by occasionally, maybe looking for some absurdist conversation and decent vodka. In the wake of the War’s devastation, Hugo and this loose assemblage of like-minded artists—or “anti-artists” as they preferred – had hoped to create a more permanent home for their anti-war expression, but their own lack of cohesion may have been the Cabaret’s undoing. It only lasted a year or so, and the avant-garde moved on. Over the years the Cabaret Voltaire deteriorated, and after a brief period of occupation by neo-Dada squatters, the building was saved from demolition. In 2004 it reopened as a café, cultural and education center, and bookshop. Hugo Ball and his pals weren’t big on organized celebrations, but even they would probably cheer a hundred years of Dada.

Piz Gloria is named after the 1963 James Bond novel and subsequent film, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, in which a mountain-top hideout conceals Bond’s nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Today, Piz Gloria taps into its James Bond past by offering visitors a 007 Walk of Fame and interactive exhibit aptly named Bond World. The restaurant, which is truly the main draw for travelers, rotates slowly offering diners a view of 200 mountain peaks during the course of their meal. While the food of Piz Gloria has been reviewed as lackluster and overpriced—a classic pitfall of many tourist attraction restaurants—the view overcompensates for what’s on the plate.  Piz Gloria is accessible by an aerial cable car, which departs from the town of Mürren. The cable car ride takes 32 minutes (including a change at a middle station) and offers views of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau mountains, which have been named UNESCO World Heritage Sites.",Unique Restaurants & Bars
19,Barryland,"Martigny, Switzerland","Enormous, fluffy dogs frolic around this museum dedicated to a legendary Saint Bernard.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/barryland,"The Musée et Chiens du Saint-Bernard, aka “Barryland,” is a dog-lover’s dream. Enormous, fluffy dogs abound, their tails wagging and tongues lolling against a backdrop of gorgeous mountain scenery. Playful puppies frolic around their snoozing parents. Both a breeding facility and a museum, Barryland tells the story of the Alps’ most iconic dog breed. St. Bernards are known around the world for their heroic mountain rescues. The stalwart dogs would trek across snowy, icy mountain passes in search of wayward travelers, carrying barrels of spirits around their massive, furry necks. One dog in particular, a beloved pooch named Barry, is particularly well-remembered for his heroic feats. At the turn of the 19th century, Barry lived and worked in the Great St. Bernard Hospice, an alpine hostel for all sorts of travelers. It was founded in the Middle Ages and was a spot of refuge along the ancient pilgrimage route from Canterbury to Rome that winds through treacherous alpine passes. The hospice used a hardy stock of mountain dogs to search for lost travelers and avalanche victims. According to legend, during his short life Barry dug 40 people out of the snow, plied them with Schnapps, and saved their lives by carrying them back to the safety of the hospice. He died in 1814, and his taxidermy body is now on display at the Bern Natural History Museum. Barryland pays tribute to this legendary mountain pup and his fellow St. Bernards. The lower level holds the star attraction. There, the hospice’s resident St. Bernards romp within a fenced-in enclosure, all eager to greet curious visitors. You can even go for a hike with one of the lovable dogs. The upper level contains informational displays that go far beyond the common narrative and offer a complex historical image of the local geology, zoology, religion, and politics, all woven together by a common dog-centered theme.  The museum and dog breeder are both located in the same building close to the City Center of Martigny, VS next to a Roman amphitheater. You can go there by train (station: Martigny Expo) or car. Open to visitors during the whole year, daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.",dogs mountains animals museums
20,Oepfelchammer,"Zurich, Switzerland",A 200-year-old tavern challenges guests to finish a glass of wine while hanging from a ceiling beam.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oepfelchammer,"In northern Switzerland, the city of Zurich operates as a global financial center. But its Old Town (also known as the Altstadt), showcases the quieter, historic side of the city. Nestled the heart of the Altstadt, in a building originally constructed as a residence for nobles more than 650 years ago, sits Oepfelchammer. The tavern is known for its long history and, more recently, its unique drinking ritual. The building earned its name after its stint as a convent’s apple storage unit. In the 17th century, the property became a bakery, and it was a baker who first got permission to start serving drinks in 1801. Today, the restaurant serves Swiss fare and fine wine. After 6:00 p.m., visitors to the tavern are only permitted to drink water, grape juice, or wine. But most importantly, and much more idiosyncratically, Oepfelchammer hosts a drinking ritual known as balkenprobe, or beam challenge. To attempt the challenge, participants scramble and kick their way up onto a ceiling beam. Then, they crawl over to the adjacent rafter and hang upside-down. A waiter brings over a glass of white wine and the inverted guest then attempts to down the entire glass without spilling it. (You can watch someone successfully complete the mission on YouTube.) Should they succeed, the winner adds their name to the collection of carvings on the wall. Anyone who initially fails is entitled to two more attempts. Regardless of the outcome, all who brave Oepfelchammer’s balkenprobe are entitled to a wholly unique kind of hangover.

This engineering marvel is rendered even more incredible by the fact its construction predates cranes and helicopters. Construction on the Niesenbahn began in 1906, and the line officially opened in 1910. Composed of two sections separated by an intermediate station (the only other station on the line aside from the two terminals), the Niesenbahn carries passengers from the Mülenen train station to the looming peak of the nearby Niesen mountain. The upper station sits at an elevation of 2,336 meters (7,664 feet) above sea level. To reach that summit, the tracks proceed along severe and dizzying inclines, reaching a maximum gradient of 68%. The cars can accommodate a maximum of 65 passengers and take approximately 30 minutes to complete the entire journey. More adventurous sightseers are given the option of hiking between any of the two stations, either on the way up or the way down. Less adventurous sightseers can rest assured that the cable supporting the Niesenbahn funicular is engineered to carry over eight times the train’s total weight load, and that the cars are outfitted with automatic brakes.",funicular panoramas trains mountains

23,Leuk Charnel House,"Leuk, Switzerland",For centuries no one knew there were hundreds of bones and precious artwork hidden beneath this Swiss church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leuk-charnel-house,"Beneath an unmarked cellar door in a 15th century church lies a dark, secret, osteological oddity. Leuk is a small town in Switzerland’s Rhone Valley mostly known for the thermal spa to the north, but the town itself has been around a very, very long time. The first church was built around the 6th century out of a preexisting Roman building. This was torn down and reconstructed several times before the gothic St. Stephan’s Church was erected in 1494. In 1981 the church undertook a restoration project. The restorers pulled up the floorboards with the intention of building a basement community center, but soon found that would be impossible. A hidden cellar had been housing a 9-foot-tall, 65-foot-long wall of skulls for centuries. During archaeological excavation the very next year, 26 statues were discovered hidden beneath three feet of bones. They were dated between the 13th and the 16th centuries, around the time the current church building was constructed. The artworks found in the charnel house included a remarkable Pièta and a well-preserved Danse Macabre fresco, still on view in the charnel house. Its memento mori inscription reads: “What you are, we once were. What we are, you will become.” No one is quite sure why the charnel house is there, or why it was kept secret. Some historians speculate that these many bones didn’t end up beneath the church via war, disease, famine or disaster, but rather there simply wasn’t enough room in the cemetery for them. Some of the skulls have what appear to be bullet wounds, which may mean that they were victims of a 1798 battle, exhumed from the cemetery after it became overfull. Whatever the case, the discovery enlivened the city. Several medieval buildings in Leuk were in ruins and slated for demolition. When the secret ossuary beneath St. Stephan’s was discovered, renewed interest in the old buildings increased. They have now been restored, and serve as another draw to the historic little town.",ossuaries secret memento mori catacombs and crypts hidden death burial places

But on the gentle slopes of the northern shore of Geneva Lake, the gentle climate actually offers ideal conditions for growing grapes. White wine is an essential part of local Swiss specialties, cheese fondue and raclette. The entire region around the city of Lausanne is a patchwork of vineyards. Arguably, the most beautiful among them are the ones in the district of Lavaux, to the east of the city. The vineyards of Lavaux are over 800 years old. They were first planted by the monks of the local abbey. The whole district is a maze of vineyard terraces built on a steep hillside, overlooking the lake and offering a postcard perfect view of Alps on the other side. The main wine grape variety grown here is the Chasselas. Locals say that grapes here ripen under the “three suns”, direct sunlight, rays reflected off the surface of the lake and heat accumulated in terrace stones. Lavaux is a UNESCO World Heritage Sites since July 2007. It offers excellent opportunities for hiking and bicycle tours.

He also constructed a great palace known as the Towerhouse, where he and his wife live and work, that looms over the strange exotic world he has created. Covered in murals, and reminiscent of both an Indian temple and a Gothic cathedral, the interior of the Towerhouse, filled with homemade furniture, is even more whimsical than the sculpture garden. Worried by the threat of modernization swallowing the once sleepy farm village of Dietikon, Weber wanted his park to be a place for the imagination to roam free. *Bruno Weber died in October 2011. Some of his family still lives at the Towerhouse, but you can visit one room in the main floor of the house. His wife also created several of the mosaic works and lamps in the house and around the park.  The park is located at the top of a hill that is only reached by a small road not open to regular traffic. You should park at the public parking near the City Hall in Dietikon: Fondlistrasse 158953 Dietikon and then walk up the hill past several large fields of commnity gardens to the park.

28,Grottes de Vallorbe,"Vallorbe, Switzerland",Over 3km of caverns and caves at the Switzerland-France border contain the largest underground river in Central Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grottes-de-vallorbe,"After 150 million years of thrashing and roaring through limestone rock, the Orbe River is content to wind leisurely through three kilometers of caverns and caves, now known as the Grottes de Vallorbe. Discovered in 1961 by divers exploring a siphon, the sight was made public in 1974 and have welcomed researchers and spectators alike to see the largest caves in the Jura region. Additionally filled with waterfalls, stalagmites, dripping columns, fistulas, gushing whirlpools, and immense yawning ceilings, the Grottes de Vallorbe are a sight to behold, and a frigid one at that. Temperatures inside the caves stay at a steady 10 degrees Celsius year round. Humidity takes over at a full 100%, not surprising as the hum of rushing water is a constant reminder that you are just meters above the largest underground river in Central Europe. Recent technology has improved the experience for today’s visitors: user activated lighting highlights unusual features of the cave one by one in a “light show”, while duckboard passages allow for a full view of cave surfaces. Somewhat bizarre is at the end of the tour in which a mannequin dressed in a stereotypical fairy garb welcomes visitors to view the mineral collection, or Fairy Treasure Trove. In any case, the collection is impressive with over 250 rocks and gems from around the world in a spaceship like setting. Exploration and development in the caves continue to this day. Also, if (on the way back to the car park) you take the public footpath that branches off to your left and goes over the stream, climb up it for 15-20 minutes, you will come to a couple of other caves.

But those seeking one of the world’s best succulent collections should head to a more unexpected spot. Every year, cactus lovers from near and far—think plant collectors, botanists, historians, scientists, and curious locals—journey to this Swiss botanic center, which is considered one of the world’s largest and most important collections of succulents. Seeing these desert-dwelling plants next to a lake and backdropped by distant mountains is a jarring sight. About 6,500 different succulent species are displayed, all spread out between huge, airy greenhouses as well as outdoor beds representing different climate zones. There’s also an outstanding library, a seed bank, and an herbarium. During the summer, visitors are treated with a special nocturnal event: the rare bloom of the Selenicereus grandiflorus, a cactus dubbed the “Queen of the Night” that blossoms with large, sweet-scented flowers one night per year. The city hasn’t always wanted this beautiful collection of desert plants. In the 1920s, a local cactus grower tried and failed to sell his cactus collection to the city. A local store owner then acquired the plants and proceeded to gift them to Zürich. The Sukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich (which literally translates to the Succulent Collection of Zürich) was then founded in 1931. The municipality has since attempted to shut down the money-consuming garden it inherited, but local plant lovers rallied to save their beloved prickly place.

31,Haus Hiltl,"Zurich, Switzerland","Featuring a meatless buffet fit for kings, this family-owned Zurich eatery is considered the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the West.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haus-hiltl-oldest-vegetarian-restaurant-switzerland,"For vegetarians left hungry by the meat-laden menus of many European restaurants, Haus Hiltl’s 100-dish no-meat buffet is like water in the desert. A veritable cornucopia of global vegetarian flavors, from saffron gnocchi to palak paneer, the pay-by-weight buffet is only one part of what is now a Swiss vegetarian empire, which has its headquarters on Zurich’s Sihlstrasse. While the Guinness Book of World Records named Haus Hiltl the world’s oldest vegetarian restaurant, it’s more likely the oldest of its kind in the Western world. Opened by restauranteur Ambrosius Hiltl in 1898, the still family-owned establishment has been been patronized by notable vegetarians, including at least one prime minister, ever since. Originally dubbing his eatery with the admittedly less sexy-sounding name Vegetarierheim and Abstinenzcafé (“vegetarian home and abstinence cafe”), Ambrosius Hiltl was a man ahead of his time. More than 100 years before the plant-based diet influencers of Instagram, he became a convert to the health benefits of avoiding meat when, at a doctor’s recommendation, he switched to an all-veg diet to help his rheumatism. When his rheumatism improved, Hiltl became a lifelong advocate of vegetarianism. At the time in Switzerland, the Sunday roast was considered the pinnacle of culinary accomplishment, and Hiltl’s vegetarian cathedral was derided as a “root cellar.” As family lore has it, some initial customers were so ashamed of their meatless emasculation (then, like now, meat was tied to bodily robustness and masculinity), they entered the establishment through the back door. Today, the restaurant’s tagline, “Healthy Indulgence,” continues to push back against the stereotype that vegetarian food is bland. Haus Hiltl owes much of its menu to vegetarian dining traditions in other parts of the world, particularly India. Thanks to religious practices within Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, many of India’s vast and varied cuisines have been historically vegetarian—and these cuisines had a longstanding impact on Haus Hiltl’s  menu. In 1951, family member Margrith Hiltl served as Switzerland’s delegate in the World Vegetarian Congress in Delhi. There, she met future Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who ate at Haus Hiltl on a journey to Switzerland in 1953. The cultural exchange has enriched Hiltl’s menu, which includes items such as an Indian vegetarian thali, or meal combo. The restaurant remains a great option for vegetarians lost in a sea of meat, but the owners say that about 80 percent of diners aren’t vegetarian: They just come for the food. With dishes such as eggplant-and-okra-filled bamja, a mean vegetarian Bolognese, and a pay-by-weight dessert buffet, even the most avowed of carnivores are sure to admit that the erstwhile “abstinence cafe” is anything but a root cellar.  While Haus Hiltl on Sihlstrasse is the restaurant's flagship location (and the location of its most formidable buffet), there are several other locations in Zurich, including a la carte restaurants and Switzerland's only vegetarian deli. The flagship location is open 365 days a year, so you don't have to let pesky things such as public holidays come between you and a serious craving for vegetarian. If you want to take your commitment to vegetarian bliss one step further, the Hiltl empire also offers cooking classes.",switzerland vegan vegetarian restaurants
32,Kaltbach Cave,"Kaltbach, Switzerland",A 22-million-year-old sandstone cave is a natural habitat for award-winning cheese.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaltbach-cave,"In the undulating, green sprawl of an Alpine Valley, clouds swimming against snow-capped mountains, placid cows grazing on verdant meadows, a cave formed from a prehistoric seabed is carrying a culinary secret so glorious that its legacy traverses the globe: from the bucolic idyll of a Swiss vale a few miles from Lucerne, right to your neighborhood supermarket. For many shoppers who browse the cheese aisle at their local grocer’s, the little wedges of Emmi Le Gruyère, in their translucent wrappers with the blue company logo and the Swiss cross at the top, are hard to miss. But few buyers know that the cheese is meticulously aged at the Kaltbach Cave, a tunnel-like cave within the Santenberg mountain with climatic conditions that are just right for ripening cheese. The cool subterranean labyrinth of the Kaltbach Cave is the natural incubator for 156,000 wheels of cheese, mostly gruyère and emmentaler. Stretching over a mile, stacked shelves hold the cheeses at temperatures around 50 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, and the cool waters of the river (Kaltbach means “cold river”) that runs through the cave keep humidity levels at around 96 percent. The cave’s unique climate and the interaction of mineral deposits on the sandstone with the cheese create a distinctive flavor and aroma, and give the rinds their signature dark brown color. Like artists working on their masterpiece, cavemasters turn, wash, and brush the wheels with a brine solution every 7 to 10 days. The cheeses stay in the cave for at least nine months, diligently monitored until they reach just the right aromatic and textural maturity. The art of caring for and gauging the maturity of cheese is called cheese refinement, and it’s a skill transferred down through generations of cave masters at Kaltbach, with no written record of the training. The cave was discovered in 1953 as a natural cheese-aging habitat when local cheesemakers ran out of storage space and began keeping them in the Kaltbach. In 1993, Emmi acquired the cave and has been storing and aging their finest cheeses in it since. The contribution of this tranquil cave in a Swiss mountain to the cheese boards of the world should go unnoticed no more.  Emmi organizes tours of the cave.

33,United Nations Ceiling,"Geneva, Switzerland",This colorful but controversial ceiling has been likened to a 21st-century Sistine Chapel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/united-nations-ceiling,"On November 18, 2008, the United Nations inaugurated a refurbished meeting room at its European headquarters. The room’s ceiling instantly caught the attention of the global media. Some admired the artistic endeavor, calling the room a “21st-century Sistine Chapel.” Others decried the costly project, and criticized the manner in which it had been funded. The Human Rights and Alliance of Civilizations Room, formerly known as Room XX, is one of the largest conference rooms in the Palace of Nations. Its redesign, carried out as part of a Spanish donation to the UN, took more than two years to complete. It was inaugurated by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the King and Queen of Spain, with some 700 guests in attendance. While some tech-minded attendees were undoubtedly focused on the state-of-the-art technology installed in the meeting room, most eyes were turned up toward the ceiling. Above them, the old dome had been changed into a sea of color, one which appeared to drip with stalactites of red and blue and yellow. This was the work of Miquel Barceló, one of Spain’s leading contemporary artists. For two years, Barceló had worked to transform the 16,000-square-foot elliptical dome into something truly special. He and his 20 assistants—including a cook and a cave expert—used more than 100 tons of paint to decorate the ceiling, purposefully choosing pigments from all over the world. And among the sea of bright colors hang the stalactites, which initially unnerved some of those standing below (while others joked that they might fall on the heads of their political rivals). To make sure no such calamity occurred, Barceló hung the resin stalactites, some of which are almost three feet long, from a specially-made aluminum honeycomb, making sure they could not fall. Barceló’s inspiration for the ceiling came from a hot day in the Sahel region of Africa. In language that Hunter S. Thompson would have approved of, the artist explained the roots of his vision: “I remember with the vividness of a mirage the image of the world dripping toward the sky. Trees, dunes, donkeys, multicolored beings… trickling drop by drop. And being consumed.” His work was generally seen as an artistic triumph, with many commentators calling the newly unveiled meeting room a modern Sistine Chapel. Controversy, however, was almost sure to follow, especially in such a hotbed of political discourse. The project had cost around 20 million euros ($25.25 million), with the bulk of the money coming from the ONUART Foundation, a Spanish non-profit, public-private partnership established by the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Of the public money, 500,000 euros ($633,000) came from a budget for overseas development aid and international organizations (like the United Nations). Unsurprisingly, critics argued that this money could have been spent alleviating poverty and improving health care in poorer countries. The debate raged on, with various claims and counterarguments coming from both sides. Javier Garrigues, Spain’s ambassador to the UN, argued that the project was justified considering its location: “Funding the human rights headquarters clearly falls into the category of development aid,” he said. As for Miquel Barceló, he responded to the controversy in a level-headed and sober manner, ditching his more trippy rhetoric to explain how the whole episode had taught him “to be careful in dealings with the political class and to spend more time in my workshop.”  The Human Rights and Alliance of Civilizations Room (home of Miquel Barceló’s ceiling) is located in the Palace of Nations (Palais des Nations) in Geneva, Switzerland. Tours of the palace, which include the Human Rights and Alliance of Civilizations Room, take place most days. Visitors must enter through the Pregny Gate of the palace at 14, avenue de la Paix.

This would be a superhuman feat, as the fork weighs a monumental 929 pounds and stands tall at 26 feet and 2.4 inches. It was declared the world’s tallest fork in 2014, and has become a town symbol. But how did a giant fork come to be lodged in the lake? The bizarre installation was originally created in 1995 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Alimentarium, a food-themed museum in the town. The giant utensil was designed by sculptor Jean-Pierre Zaugg and was instant hit among the townspeople and tourists. Despite efforts to make it a permanent feature, in 1996 it was shipped off to a garden in Littau, Lucerne, and only made it back to Vevey in 2007 for an exhibition on cutlery. This time, a stronger push was made by the town council to retain it permanently as part of the lake’s landscape and they succeeded.

Yet it’s made all the more charming by what’s inside. Built in the 13th century as a defensive fortress, the château of Tour-de-Peilz spent centuries keeping watch on the traffic on the lake. The castle is now preserved as a historical monument, with a stunning view. Since 1987 it has also been home to Switzerland’s first and only board game museum. The Swiss Museum of Games (Musee Suisse du Jeu) is a treasure trove of games played in different cultures around the world, from ancient times until today. Along with the classics—mahjong from China, oware from Africa, pachisi (later parcheesi) from India—the collection includes some unusual pieces like a Cold War spy table game and a collection of vintage slot machines. There are card games, board games, puzzles, and casino games. All the classics are represented here: backgammon, bridge, checkers, Scrabble, Monopoly. And of course, there’s an entire exhibition singularly devoted to chess, including a life-size chess set you can play outside next to the lake. There’s also a library with some 5,000 game-related books. You won’t find video games or mobile games here, though. The curators believe old-fashioned physical games aren’t going anywhere, even as the digital age races forward.

36,Frog Museum,"Estavayer-le-Lac, Switzerland",150-year-old satirical tableaus made from stuffed frogs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/frog-museum,"The Frog Museum in Estavayer-le-Lac, Switzerland is a collection of 150-year-old satirical tableaus of domestic life in the 19th century—all involving stuffed frogs. The museum opened in 1927. According to legend, its collection began in the 1850s thanks to an eccentric military member who harbored a special love for tailless amphibians and began collecting them on his walks across the countryside. The story goes that the officer would take the frogs home, gut them, and fill the sacks of skin with sand before posing them in quirky dioramas. You’ll find much more than stuffed amphibians at this museum, though. In addition to the 108 taxidermy frogs, there’s also a collection of Swiss armaments and battle regalia and many objects related to local history, including a 17th-century kitchen, displayed in a series of small interconnecting rooms.",anthropomorphic frog dioramas taxidermy collections museums
37,Maison d'Ailleurs,"Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland","Museum of science fiction, utopias, and extraordinary journeys of the mind.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maison-dailleurs,"Maison d’Ailleurs, or the “House of Elsewhere,” revolves around extraordinary journeys—of the mind, at least. It is a museum of science fiction, utopias, and other futurist writings. The museum has had an intense history since its creation in 1976. Pierre Versins, an archivist who collected works of science fiction and related memorabilia, donated his archives to the city of Yverdon-les-Bains, which created the museum. Though originally located in a three-story townhouse, in 1991 the collection was moved to a more impressive location: a former prison built in 1806 in the middle of the city. Unfortunately, in 1995 the city cut the museum’s budget, and most of the staff were dismissed. A foundation was created to manage the museum in 1998, and a new director, Patrick Gyger, was named to coordinate the efforts. Today, its archives contain around 70,000 documents related to science fiction as well as all things futuristic—books, art pieces, toys—including some very old, unique pieces, a few dating back to the sixteenth century. The collections of the museum are also used for iconographic purposes and research (literature, the history of ideas, design, and so on). And the museum houses one of the world’s most important collections of documentation about French writer Jules Verne. In 2008, the museum premiered a new wing dedicated entirely to Jules Verne and early science fiction. It also presents two to three temporary exhibitions per year, centered on the main themes of science fiction - cities of the future (both utopian and dystopian), space travel and aliens, lost worlds, etc.—and the artists who rendered them beautifully. Maison d’Ailleurs is a resource that not only catalogues our ever-changing vision of the future, but preserves it for our actual future, so that those who come after may understand something about us—an opportunity any science fiction writer can surely appreciate.

38,Méret Oppenheim Fountain,"Bern, Switzerland",The Swiss artist's bulbous and overgrown shape-shifting sculpture controversially graces the center of Bern.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/meret-oppenheim-fountain,"Méret Oppenheim is ranked among Switzerland’s most well-known artists, known for her vast surrealist oeuvre, and most iconically, for her hairy 1936 work Le Déjeuner en Fourrure (Luncheon in Fur). One of the last masterpieces Oppenheim ever created is considerably more obscure but no less strange than the famous furry teacup, and it can be found in the heart of her chosen home city of Bern. Spirale (Gang de Natur), or The Spiral Column (Nature’s Way), is a spiral-shaped column made of concrete and aluminum. It rises several feet high, and functions as a fountain with water running down the outside. But what makes this piece so unusual is that over the years, the once plain, brutalist-style column has changed drastically in shape and texture. Water and minerals have created bizarre chunks of tufa, a kind of limestone, that “grow” on top of the object, as well as several kinds of plants, mosses, and lichens. What’s more, the piece changes its look every season. When frozen in winter, the fountain is covered over and over with icicles. In spring, tiny flowers bloom on top of it. Indeed the sculpture at Waisenhausplatz in central Bern has grown so fast that in 2013 it required radical renovations. Some 880 pounds of material was removed in order to maintain the object’s stability. This coincided with Oppenheim’s 100th birthday, and since then the lumpy, organic shape has grown back. Meanwhile, Bernese inhabitants are not aligned in their opinion of the obscure fountain. Some complain about its sheer ugliness and costly maintenance, while some admire its ability to transform. Whereas biologists appreciate the unique biotope that has been created in the middle of the city, others complain about the moldy and rusty look. Since Oppenheim herself died two years after the fountain’s installation in 1985, nobody can even be sure about whether she intended the shape-shifting property of her work, or simply did not take into account the high chalk content of Bern’s tap water.  Located at Waisenhausplatz (Orphanage Plaza) in the middle of Bern's Old City. The fountain is freely accessible all year long.",biology fountains columns public art towers sculptures nature art
39,Heureka Useless Machine,"Zurich, Switzerland",One of a series of no-purpose kinetic artworks by Swiss sculptor Jean Tinguely.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/heureka-useless-machine,"Jean Tinguely was a Swiss sculptor famous for his no-purpose kinetic artworks. Heureka one such useless machine. The title, “Heureka,” is Ancient Greek for “I’ve got it!” This is meant to be ironic. The sculpture, created in 1964, is an allegory of consumerism in advanced industrial societies. The machine churns and churns but with no purpose, just absurdity. The Heureka sculpture is made from everyday objects like scrap metal and junk; it’s comprised of various tubes, wheels, iron bars, metal pipes, and electric motors assembled together to create an intricate machine when turned on — or rather, the illusion of one. Tinguely meant there to be humor in the creation, a poetic recycling of the industrial world. He was a follower of the French Nouveau Réalisme art movement, a 1960s avant-garde style that incorporated elements of the real world and everyday life into artworks, creating a new way to perceive reality. Part of the movement’s ideology was responding to the new consumerism in Western society. Tinguely was inspired by Dadaism, which challenged the norms of bourgeoisie high society, a kind of artistic anarchy. Heureka is one of several kinetic works, or “metamechanics” of Tinguely’s career. Another sculpture, called “Homage to New York,” intentionally partially self-destructed at the Museum of Modern Art. Tinguely created the Heureka sculpture for the Swiss National Exhibition in Lausanne and it was later moved to Zürich, where you can marvel at it today in all its complex futility. Tinguely is also responsible for a monstrous, whimsical monument called Le Cyclop hidden deep in the forest of Milly-la-Forêt, France, and was the partner of Niki de Saint Phalle, a prolific outsider sculptor. Update August 2018: Unfortunately the sculpture is now heavily obstructed by the popular Allianz Cinema Zürich. A sign has been placed nearby to educate visitors on its significance, but the operation of the machine and the ability to view it closely now remain severely impeded. From April to October the sculpture is turned on every day at 11:00, 15:00 and 19:00 for 8 minutes.",jean tinguely machines technology sculptures art
40,Bhutanese Bridge Over the Illgraben,"Leuk, Switzerland",A symbol of friendship between the mountainous regions of Switzerland and Bhutan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bhutanese-bridge-over-the-illgraben,"In 2002 the United Nations declared the “International Year of Mountains” in order to promote solidarity between the mountainous regions of the world and raise awareness for their sustainable development. From this, the idea to build the Bhutanese Bride over the Illgraben creek in the Wallis region of the Swiss Alps was born—a symbol of the “bridge” between different cultures. Specifically, the Bhutanese Bridge symbolized the friendship between the canton Wallis in Switzerland, country of the Alps, and the Kingdom Bhutan, country of the Himalaya. The bridge also connects the German-speaking area of the Wallis mountains with the French-speaking area. Planned in Bhutan, the bridge was built by constructors in Wallis under the supervision of a Bhutanese engineer. During the planning period even the Queen of Bhutan came to visit the Wallis. It opened in 2005. To protect the bridge, both a Christian Cross and a Bhutanese stupa, built by French Lamas, were erected nearby. Prayer flags decorate the bridge along both sides of the rail. The 134-meter-long bridge offers great views. But be forewarned the small Illgraben Creek often dries up and can quickly become treacherous: Many mudflows occur every year, sometimes carrying several thousand tons of rubble and mud at 25 km per hour, in a wall 2 meters high. Those mudflows are very dangerous, fascinating as they are, even to locals.  The bridge can be crossed at all times, but not during mudflows.",bridges
41,The Bisses of Valais,"Botyre (Ayent), Switzerland",Medieval irrigation channels built into the sides of mountains provided Valais with water for hundreds of years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-bisses-of-valais-botyre-ayent-switzerland,"Some of the best places to hike in the state of Valais in Switzerland are ancient pathways that once used to bring water down from mountain streams to farms in the valleys and meadows below. The creation of these channels, known as bisses, goes back at least as far as the 14th century, though some believe those medieval routes were built where Roman channels had previously been. In the aftermath of the Black Death in the mid-1300s, with a significantly reduced population across Europe, the grain fields in Valais were repurposed to grow hay to raise cattle for the rising demand of beef across the border in Italy. Owners of the fields and pastures pooled their resources to build bisses for irrigation, which was more necessary than it had been for growing grain. A lot of resources were needed, since many of the bisses were built into the sides of mountains and cliffs, which made digging them particularly dangerous hundreds of years ago. They tended to be between 5 and 10 kilometers, though a few stretched more than 20 kilometers. Over time, they came to be used by vineyards and orchards in the area as well. Those more wealthy landowners, who controlled the water supply, arranged for systems allowing the use of the water by the smaller farmers. The smaller farmers and their families, in turn, helped maintain the bisses, cleaning and repairing them every spring. Canal guards, who lived in cabins along the channels, kept regular watch over the flow of water, making sure it was not interrupted. For the most part, the bisses that remain have become scenic tourist attractions and inspired hiking trails, though some are still in use. Some of the trails run alongside the bisses, but others are the bisses themselves, repaired and reinforced. Le Musée des Bisses offers a convenient itinerary of some of the most spectacular bisse-adjacent trails, the bisse of Sion, the bisse ‘Ayent, and the Bitailla, in addition to exhibits on the history of the Valais bisses.",waterworks farms mountains ancient water
42,Collection de l'Art Brut,"Lausanne, Switzerland","Artworks by loners, prisoners and the criminally insane.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/collection-de-lart,"Some would say that the definition of true art is its ability to provoke a response in the observer, be it positive or negative, emotional or rational. Art Brut–“brut” in the sense of raw–is a term applied to art created outside not only the boundaries of conventional culture, but by those outside mainstream society. The unique art Collection de l’Art Brut in Lausanne contains works of artists from the fringes of society–schizophrenic patients, loners, lost souls, the criminally insane–who suddenly and unexpectedly began making their own art, often in middle or old age. For example, there was Henry Darger, who died an old man after spending a lifetime as a hospital porter in Chicago, his artistic talents unknown even to his closest neighbors, until his 19,000-page novel, filled with a thousand intricate watercolor illustrations, surfaced after his death. What results is art entirely free from any conception of formal artistic rules or conventions, which challenges both how we tend to view such “outsiders” in our own communities, and our expectations of what art should be about. Many of the short biographies presented alongside each piece tell heartrendingly sad or disturbing stories about these untrained but passionate artists. The art is fascinating by itself, but when connected with the often tragic life stories of the creators of these works, it takes on new, profound meaning.",crime outsider art
43,Bärengraben,"Bern, Switzerland",The bears of Bern have been a city highlight for over 500 years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/barengraben,"On the edge of the Aare River, across from the old town (Altstadt) of Bern, Switzerland, is one of Bern’s most famous tourist attractions: the Bärengraben, or Bear Park. In Bern, you’ll find images of bears everywhere you look. Bear cookies, bear sculptures, bear doorknobs, and bear flags are just a few examples. Legend has it in 1191 Duke Berthold the Fifth swore to name his newly founded town after the first animal he killed on a hunt in the surrounding forest, which turned out to be a bear. The town embraced this beer-centric worldview and decided that if they were going to be called bear, they should have some bears. In 1513, the first bear pit was set up in the city near the Käfigturm (Cage Tower) in what is present-day called Bärenplatz (Bear Square.) This bear pit was relocated in 1764 to the Schanzengraben (Moat) in Bollwerk, in front of the gateway to the city. The final, still visible bear pit was opened on May 27, 1857. Over the centuries the bears of Bern have been visited by luminaries such as the German Emperor, the King of Siam, Alexander Dumas, Albert Einstien (it was a short walk from his apartment at Kramgasse 49,] and even Lenin stopping by. In an age before animal rights, the bears were treated inhumanely and kept crowded in the small pit, resulting in fights between the bears and the resulting injuries. They were fed a vegetarian diet, and onlookers would toss bits of cheese to the well-fed animals. The bears did occasionally get their fill of meat when an eager onlooker tumbled head over heels into the pit. In 1903 a drunk convict fell into the pit, passed out, and spent the night there. He was incredibly lucky; he was about to be mauled to death when authorities found him and intervened. Things got slightly better for the bears over the years, but the pit (remodeled in the mid-1990s) was still much too small for the large animals. By 2000 the bear pit, and the mangy, bored bears eating hunks of cheese in it, were becoming an embarrassment for the wealthy and progressive Bern. In 2009 the last two remaining bears were put down due to health problems and for the first time in 496 years, bears ceased to have a presence in the city of Bern. Then, on October 25, 2009, the renamed Bärenpark opened to the public. The bears of Bern now live in a 6000-square-meter park along the banks of the River Aare. The large bear pit is still accessible to the bears for their continued use and the smaller bear pit now is open to the public and is used as a concert venue from time to time.  The number 12 bus will bring you right to the front of the bear park.",animals
44,St. Peter’s Island,"Erlach, Switzerland",The idyllic island where the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau spent “the happiest time of his life.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-peters-island-sankt-petersinsel,"In 1765, the Swiss political philosopher and revolutionary intellectual Jean-Jacques Rousseau was expelled from France where he had spent several years. He resettled in his country of birth and found refuge in the monastery of St. Peter’s Island in the middle of Switzerland’s Lake Biel. After years of publishing (more or less legally) angry political pamphlets and having heated debates in the crowded city of Paris, his philosophical approach shifted radically in this remote piece of earth. The lovely landscape, incredible mountain views, long lonely walks, boating and taking “baths” in flower meadows gave Rousseau a yet-unknown peace of mind. In his famous 1778 book, Reveries of a Solitude Walker, he dedicated a whole chapter (chapter 5) to the island, writing that he had spent the six happiest weeks of his entire life there. The book is considered as a key work in the literary paradigms of subjectivism, pre-romanticism, and romantic sensitivity, where the experience of natural beauty became the leading theme and moral dispositive. But after only six weeks, Rousseau was expelled from the island because Bernese aristocrats we worried about their controversial revolutionary guest. The monastery that had hosted Rousseau still exists and hosts a seminary hotel. Rousseau himself lived in the janitor’s house on the monastery grounds. Today, a monument reminds of the island’s most famous visitor and the Erlach municipality offers Rousseau-themed guided tours across the island. St. Peter’s is covered with vineyards and tiny villages built in Swiss chalet style, and the mountain views from the island are indeed extremely beautiful.  St. Peter’s Island (Sankt Petersinsel in German) is actually now a peninsula and can be easily accessed by bike, ship, of public transport.",philosophy writers books islands nature
45,Psychiatrie-Museum Bern,"Ostermundigen, Switzerland","This small museum displays a collection of outsider art and scale models of past ""treatments"" for mental illness.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/psychiatriemuseum-bern,"On the beautiful grounds of the University of Psychiatric Services in Bern stands a small museum displaying the history of psychiatric care at the location of the former Waldau Insane Asylum. The museum was established in 1914 by doctor Walter Morgenthaler, who worked in the Waldau clinic. Noting that many of the patients developed unusual and interesting artistic talents as a result of their psychiatric conditions, he assembled a large collection of patients’ artwork and texts. The most spectacular of these are the  furniture of Adolf Wölfli, who would become known as one of the most productive art brut masters. In addition to artwork, the museum shows a number of old handling and treatment aids and give a pretty good idea about the actual conditions of how the patients were treated and maintained. The methods could be both brutal and bizarre. One strange and short lived treatment was known as “centrifuge therapy.” Centrifuge therapy, also known as “spinning chair,” or “whirling cage” therapy, was used in the 18th century as a general cure for insanity. The therapy followed a homeostasis logic: mental patients are walking about the hospital, disoriented, confused, and dizzy in the mind (spinners is german slang for the mentally ill). For these unfortunate patients, their world was spinning. Doctors thought it stood to reason that if their minds were spinning, spin their bodies to match the outside world to their minds. Thus, when they stopped spinning, so will their brains. (Some doctors also believed mental illness was due to congested blood in the brain, and that the spinning dispersed the clotted blood.) Displayed with small dolls at the museum, the patient would be strapped down to either a chair or a bed, which would then be spun by a large crank at about 100 revolutions per minute. It was believed to be effective for a time, likely because the patients were dizzy to the point of nearing unconsciousness, thus appearing more calm.",psychiatry insane asylums museums
46,La Tulipe,"Geneva, Switzerland","A rare, flower-shaped example of Brutalist architecture in Switzerland.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-tulipe,"This rare piece of Swiss Brutalism is a unique, gorgeous piece of architectural eye candy. The pink, blue, and orange hues of the windows make it look as through the glass is permanently reflecting a cotton candy-colored sky. The 1976 building is home to the Swiss Medical Research Foundation and has been nicknamed la Tulipe (the Tulip) because of its shape and vividly colorful tinted windows. It was designed by architect Jack Vicajee Bertoli, who once collaborated with the famed proto-Brutalist architect Le Corbusier. The unusual building is considered to be a rare example of (soft) Brutalist architecture within Switzerland. La Tulipe stands out among its nearby structures. It seems like the type of architecture you’d expect to find in an ex-Soviet republic rather than in Geneva. The strange union of harsh, hulking concrete and rosy glass makes it look a bit out of place within its surroundings. It’s also jarring to see the blunt, straightforward elements of Brutalism used to create a florally inspired building that looks both stoic and delicate.  The building is situated just next to the main hospital of the city.",brutalism architecture

On offer are tissues, rosaries, condolence cards, and even a tiny music box playing “You Are My Sunshine.” Prices for these objects range from 1 to 20 Swiss Francs. Designed and constructed by Swiss designer Lea Hofer, “Der Trauerautomat,” roughly translating to “The Mourning Machine,” was set up in 2018 at the main entrance to Friedhof Sihlfeld (Sihlfeld Cemetery). Though it may seem a macabre amenity at first look, the idea behind Hofer’s work is to destigmatize mourning and grief and open up a public discussion on what is still a taboo topic. Sure enough, after being installed at the cemetery the unique machine has stirred up controversy in the Swiss press and online communities. Some perceive it as tasteless and irreverent, while others appreciate this creative approach to tackling uncomfortable subjects. The vending machine is part of the Friedhof Forum at the Sihlfeld cemetery, Switzerland’s first cultural service center that offers information and discussion around death, burials, and mourning. The forum’s so-called “office of the last journey” also hosts temporary exhibitions on these difficult subject. The current exhibition displays a collection of objects left behind by the dead, a tangible approach to talking about death and loss. Update as of June 2022: The vending has been removed.

The stately building hosts a unique museum dedicated to all kind of spiritual movements, occult circles, religious groups, and mystic leaders connected to witches and witchcraft—and, of course, their numerous enemies throughout history. The Hexenmuseum Schweiz (Witchcraft Museum Switzerland) is founded and directed by Wicca Meier-Spring, a modern witchcraft practitioner who aims to tackle the prejudices that witches still face in today’s society. Spanning all continents, witches and witchcraft have been a part of many cultures and civilizations from antiquity to today. From ancient Egyptian dynasties through the rites of American First Nations to New Age movements and beloved fantasy stories, the museum offers a comparative perspective on this multifaceted phenomenon. The exhibition spans several rooms that display a vast collection of curious objects related to folk medicine, folk art, alchemy, astrology, anthropology, archeology, local Swiss traditions, religions, and occultism. There is an herb garden, a divination room, a library, and many other carefully curated exhibits. A large part of the exhibition also commemorates the roughly 10,000 men, women, and children who were murdered during the terrible witch hunts and witch trials all over Switzerland between the 13th and 18th centuries. But this museum is unique in that it looks at how that tragic time impacted modern society and the way witchcraft is viewed today.  The museum is not suitable for children younger than 11 years of age. It has no regular opening hours but upcoming hours and dates are published on the website several months in advance. The museum offers a series of unique guided tours, talks, workshops, and events, such as night walks during the full moon or advanced classes in fortune-telling.

The year 1816 went down in history as “the year without summer.” The volcano Mount Tambora in Indonesia erupted in 1815, causing climate abnormalities all around the globe. The severe levels of sulfur dioxide pollution in the atmosphere made the global average temperature plummet for three years. Floods, crop failures, extreme rain and snowfall, and a general lack of sunshine wreaked havoc around the globe. During this terrible summer of 1816, Lord Byron came from England and rented the Villa Diodati to escape the scandals some of his love affairs had provoked back home. He spent many days and nights with his friends, among them John William Polidori, Claire Clairmont, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (later Mary Shelley). Influenced by the apocalyptic climate and social disasters, the friends started to exchange ideas on occultism and philosophy. Lord Byron also encouraged them to try their hands at writing horror stories to pass the time and reflect the mood of the dreary days. Some of those ghoulish tales were later turned into famous fiction novels. The very first draft of the manuscript for Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus was written inside Villa Diodati. The author penned the book when she was just 18. It was published in 1818. During that dreadful summer, Byron and Polidori also began working on The Vampyre, the first work related to the Romantic paradigm of vampire novels. The village of Cologny has a bus connection with Geneva.

Different parts of the façade and interior combine elements of Italian Renaissance, Rococo, Swiss Chalet Style, and Southeast Asian folk art. The stately mansion, now hosting a museum, is surrounded by a beautiful English-style garden. Both the park and villa are among Zurich’s most wondrous and outstanding architectural sights. This unique, eclectic ensemble is well preserved and there is so much detail to be discovered. Yet Villa Patumbah is not only appreciated by architecture lovers. As a post-colonial relic, the history of the building sheds light on the imperial heritage of Switzerland. Even though the state itself never colonized other nations, many Swiss citizens came to riches by profiting from the imperial structures that Germany, Britain, or France had established from the 18th century on. For instance the mansion’s owner, Carl Fürchtegott Grob-Zundel, a merchant from Zurich, made a living by exploiting a tobacco plantation in Sumatra. When he returned from Indonesia to Zurich after 11 years, his wealth was so enormous he was able to build the flamboyant Villa Patumbah, designed by the famous Swiss architects Alfred Chiodera and Theophil Tschudi. In fact the villa’s name, “Patumbah,” derives from the Indonesian language, and means “A place you like to be.”  The park is accessible free of charge year-round. The villa’s interior and museum exhibition can be visited on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. and Thursdays and Sundays from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m.",mansions colonialism gardens plants history architecture
51,Anna Göldi Museum,"Ennenda, Switzerland",The last woman executed for witchcraft in Europe is remembered in this Swiss museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anna-goldi-museum,"One irony of witch trials is that any sinister malevolence involved was thanks almost uniformly to the accusers and the court itself, rather than the poor luckless innocents who found themselves accused of the same. Few incidents demonstrate this dynamic as clearly as the trial of Anna Göldi. Göldi moved to the central Swiss canton of Glarus in 1765 and took a job as a maidservant for Johann Jakob Tschudi, a physician, magistrate, and rising political figure. She worked for Tschudi for 17 years until one day, her employer abruptly reported to local authorities that he had found needles in his eight-year-old daughter’s bread and milk, and claimed that Göldi had put them there by supernatural means. She was fired and actually managed to escape, but was subsequently apprehended and subjected to brutal torture, being hung by her thumbs with stones tied to her feet. The torture broke her and she confessed to having used the power of the Devil, whom she claimed (in notably cliche details) had appeared to her in the form of a large black dog and given her the needles. She later withdrew this confession made under duress, was tortured again, confessed again, and this time stuck with it, having perhaps noticed a pattern. On June 13, 1782, she was beheaded with a sword for her “crimes.” This was a fairly late date for a witchcraft conviction, well into the Enlightenment and well after the last witch trials in other parts of Europe. News of the trial sparked outrage in Switzerland and beyond, since she had died for what was increasingly seen as a medieval superstition. Indeed, even some details of the trial indicate that those involved realized the outrageousness of their undertaking and sought to conceal it; she was officially charged with “poisoning”, her trial avoided any official allegations of witchcraft, and the court protocols were destroyed after the trial ended. Once convicted she was sentenced to death, despite the fact that the law did not impose the death penalty for non-lethal poisoning. The details of how Anna Göldi was railroaded are no doubt disgraceful, but the most likely reason behind them is truly monstrous. Modern investigators speculate that she had an affair with Tschudi. Adultery was a crime at that time, and Göldi threatened to reveal everything when she was fired for the bogus needle accusations. As this would jeopardize Tschudi’s status as well those connected to him, they decided to solve the problem by killing her and found a superficially legal way to do so. In 2008, 226 years after her execution, the Glarus parliament acknowledged that a miscarriage of justice had taken place and officially exonerated Anna Göldi. Today, visitors can tour a museum dedicated to Göldi’s life and death within the Hänggiturm building in nearby Ennenda. There is also a memorial to Anna Göldi at the Glarus courthouse consisting of two permanently lit lamps, meant to represent violations of human rights the world over, and provide an ever-burning reminder of the injustice that Göldi, Europe’s last “witch,” was subjected to not so very long ago.",witches witchcraft monuments museums

Although the tower is strong—it’s made of 1,220 pieces, held together with 24,400 screws, and weighs over 400 tons—it only took two and a half months to build. Perched at over 7,500 feet above sea level, the theater is meant to celebrate its stunning natural landscape. The space was constructed so that theater-goers inside could still see and appreciate the surrounding views of the Alps. The project was spearheaded by the organizers of the Origen Festival of Culture, who sought to create “a direct dialogue between the performances and the landscape.” The theater’s first performance, held in July of 2017, featured opera and dance. For the next three years, the theater plans to host works that reflect the diversity of the theater, with special consideration to pieces that make use of not just the physical building, but the nature surrounding it. The one thing the Juliertheatre wasn’t built to survive? Time. The performance space is only a temporary landmark in the Julier pass, and will be taken down in 2020. When it closes, the building will be removed and the area returned to its natural state. The organizers say the unique theater’s short timeline is a reflection of “the fleeting art form of the theater and will live on in the memories of its visitors.” Until then, it will be open year-round, with performances beginning when the sun sets, so each season brings a different schedule.  Check the Origen Festival website for information about ticket purchases, transportation, performance schedule. If you use the word ""Juliertheatre"" in your search, you'll likely be directed to another Juliertheatre, in Riom, which is an old charming fort now used as a theatre.

54,Schloss Habsburg (Habsburg Castle),"Habsburg, Switzerland",An 11th-century fortress home to one of the most influential royal houses in medieval Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/schloss-habsburg-habsburg-castle,"Switzerland’s Habsburg Castle, located not far from the Aare River, in the canton of Aargau, is a fascinating medieval fortress. It was the originating seat of the House of Habsburg, one of the most influential royal houses in Europe during the Middle Ages. The castle was originally built around 1020 and extended to a double castle in the later 11th century. The rear castle still exists today, while the front castle is in ruins. The larger and smaller towers of the original castle are preserved and attached to a residential building that was erected in the 13th century. Other parts of the castle complex lie in ruins, but some of the ruined walls are visible and are fascinating to examine. Habsburg Castle was built by Count Radbot of the nearby county of Klettgau in the Duchy of Swabia, and his brother-in-law Bishop Werner von Strassburg. There is some debate on the origin of the name. Some believe that the castle was named after a hawk, which in German is Habicht, while others believe the name may come from the Middle High German word ‘hab / hap’ which means “ford,” as it is located near a ford of the Aare River. Radbot’s grandson, Otto II, was the first person to take the name of Habsburg Castle as his own name. He added “von Habsburg” to his title and created the House of Habsburg. Over time, the family name became more significant than the castle itself. Radbot’s seventh generation descendant moved the family’s power base to Austria  in 1276, and the Habsburg Castle ultimately fell to ruin. Today the castle can be explored in a few hours. An audio tour is offered that tells the story of its history, including the beginnings and rise of the Habsburg dynasty. Magnificent views can be seen from all sides of the castle, particularly from the west wall, but also looking toward the southeast. The vineyard to the east of the castle is quite lovely and extensive, with views to the fields beyond. The most exciting and scenic way to visit the castle is to walk there through trails winding through the forest from the historic town of Brugg, 4 km to the northeast. It's about an hour walk from Brugg. Alternatively, you can drive there, or take a bus from Brugg. Admission is free.",castles medieval history
55,Alte Rheinbrücke (Old Rhine Bridge),"Sevelen, Switzerland",The oldest surviving wooden bridge over Rhine lets travelers cross easily from Switzerland to Liechtensten.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alte-rheinbrucke-rhine-bridge,"In the 1860s, a project to control the flow of the Rhine was completed. It included flood-proof dams that allowed for the construction of bridges over the river. (Previously, river crossings relied on ferries.) From 1867 to 1879, 13 covered wooden bridges were built in the Rhine Valley—today, the only one that remains is the Alte Rheinbrücke (Old Rhine Bridge), which links the municipalities of Vaduz in Liechtenstein and Sevelen in Switzerland. Over time, the rest have been destroyed by floods or fire or have been decommissioned due to old age. On July 8, 1870, Sevelen had made the decision to build this last witness of the romantic wooden bridges on the Rhine and to stop the Rhine ferry. The imposing building stood on September 27, 1871 and cost CHF 28,000. Around 1900, the dilapidated bridge structure had to be replaced. The bridge at Sevelen is the largest bridge of its kind in Europe, and a significant example of Swiss timber engineering. It measures 135 meters (443 feet) long and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. It was built according to the so-called Howe’s system, which combines diagonal pressure elements made of wood with vertical tension elements made of metal. By tightening the screws of the metallic tension members, the structure could be pre-stressed, and settlements could be readjusted. The five pillars create six fields, the inner four of which are around 20.5 meters (67 feet) long. The outer two fields, which connect the bridge with the Rhine dams, are each 26.8 meters (88 feet) long. Since 1973, the bridge has been open only to pedestrians and cyclists, and heavier traffic relies on a newer concrete bridge nearby. In 1981 the government of Liechtenstein put this last covered wooden bridge over the Rhine near Sevelen-Vaduz under a preservation order.",world's oldest woodwork rivers bridges

Upon his death bed Gabriel bequeathed to the city of Lausanne 1.5 million Swiss Francs to erect a building for the use and enjoyment of the public. Construction of the Palais de Rumine didn’t take place until 1892, and owed its design to the Lyonnais architect Gaspard André. The building was inaugurated on November 3rd, 1902, although construction still continued up until 1904. During those days, it housed the library of the University of Lausanne, as well as scientific and artistic collections belonging to the Canton of Vaud. During the 1980s, however, the university moved to its current location by Lake Geneva due to lack of space, and the Palais de Rumine was restructured. Today the Palais de Rumine hosts one of the four sites of the Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne, and also contains not one, but five different museums as well. There is the Cantonal Museum of Fine Art, the Museum of Archaeology and History, the Numismatic Museum, the Geological Museum, and the Zoological Museum.

57,The Henkermuseum,"Sissach, Switzerland",Extensive private collection of authentic Medieval devices used for human torture and execution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/henkermuseum,"The Henkermuseum, or Hangman’s Museum, is one of the most unusual privately owned museums in all of Switzerland. Curator Guido Varesi has researched instruments of torture and execution for a quarter century. As he researched, Varesi slowly built an incredible collection by obtaining pieces from private collectors, auction houses, and other museums. Spread across three floors of a unique building that used to be a jailhouse that contained 3 cells, Guido Varesi’s collection includes many original devices that represent the early days of dark justice, devices used for penal execution in days long since passed. One of the most famous pieces in the Henkermuseum’s collection is the blade from the Senegal Guillotine and a model of said guillotine, a painted oak, steel, and brass model based on the only known photograph of the instrument used by the French in their African colony of Senegal. Another is a full-size replica of the French Berger guillotine built by the museum. The full size Berger machine is not on display inside the museum as it is too large. Of particular note is the large collection of authentic Medieval execution swords on display within the museum. Visitors can also see a very rare Swiss beheading axe with a proven history of removing many heads in times past. Also on display in the museum are props and equipment used by the famous Swiss escape artist Pius Buser. These include his original solid leather straitjacket and his lethal electric chair escape which he used to thrill audiences in the 1920’s Of interest, The Henkermuseum also has a “sister” museum in Canada. This is the large Medieval torture, restraint, and execution collection of Canadian extreme escape artist Steve Santini. Santini’s collection is known as The Dark Justice Museum and at the time of this writing it is a private collection with the hopes of one day being available to the general public in the form of a permanent public museum.",torture museums crime and punishment memento mori medieval museums

Arranged in an arching, half-moon shape, the underfoot artwork shines beneath the flurry of countless pedestrians. Les Naissances de la Pleine Lune (in English, The Births of the Full Moon) was installed in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1999. It may seem like the dazzling stones are a not-so-subtle reminder of the country’s famous wealth, but they’re actually a celebration of birth and life. The golden stones each show the name of a child born within the city beneath a full moon during 1998. Artists Yves Zbinden and Anne-Hélène Darbellay arranged them around a fountain near Church of St. Francis. The 18th-century fountain bubbles with water which, like birth, is a life-giving force.

59,Abbey St. Maurice d'Agaune,"Saint-Maurice, Switzerland",Abbey built on the ruins of Roman catacombs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abbey-st-maurice-d-agaune,"Roman Agaunum, or present day St. Maurice, hides a sordid past beneath its sleepy, quaint patina. During the 3rd century, Roman authority in Agaunum demanded reverence for the divinity of the Holy Roman Emperor as a God. The Theban Legion, commanded by Saint Maurice, had converted to Christianity and refused to fight other Christians. According to legend, Emperor Maximillian ordered the legion to death by decimation as punishment, in which one out of ten was beaten to death by his fellow comrades. Upon further resistance, the Emperor ordered another decimation. Still unsuccessful, he had the rest of the legion slaughtered. Today the town and Abbey bear the martyr St. Maurice’s name in testament. On September 22, 515, the Burgundian King St. Sigismond founded the Abbey on the Roman burial site and opened the “Laus Perennis” - The Perpetual Praise - on the tomb of the martyrs. Chants were performed endlessly day and night by several choirs who sang in shifts. This custom prevailed until the early ninth century. Agaunum became famous for this custom and its martyrs, and its abbey had some of the richest and best preserved relics in the West. Eugene Cox describes in his story “The Green Count” the discovery of St. Sigismond’s remains in 1365 by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV: “The abbot and monks of St. Maurice received their visitor with pleasure but declared themselves confounded when he asked to see the tomb of the holy Sigismond. ‘Seigneurs,’ replied the abbot, ‘the church we know well but are ignorant of the location of the sepulchre.’ Undaunted, Charles asked to see the chapel in which the tomb was supposed to have been.... Then the emperor ‘brought out an ancient chronicle which contained the life of St. Sigismond and the story of how he had been buried and walled up in an underground chapel.’ Charles told them where to dig and they had hardly begun when part of the wall fell away, revealing a cave containing the remains of St. Sigismond.... The monks were astonished and delighted and began to sing hymns and praises to God. The emperor, equally pleased, claimed as his reward the venerable skull for his relic collection....” In the early 17th century an avalanche destroyed the original abbey, and for fear of a similar fate another church was erected set away from the cliff where the original stood. Today it is possible to see the catacombs still intact, and the newer church built next to them. In the apse of the original church, the tomb of Saint Maurice remains with a small alter erected in his honor. Excavation began in 1945, but the ruins of the church and the catacombs remain an archeological site to this day.",catacombs and crypts ruins architectural oddities architecture

The current museum is actually the evolution of a previously established museum dedicated to the postal history of Switzerland that had been collecting artifacts since the 1800’s. By the 1990’s the “Swiss PTT Museum” had incorporated a large section devoted to telecommunications and other forms of contact that were both replacing and being integrated into formal mailing procedures. It was not long before the modern exhibitions began to overshadow the historical post office relics. In the mid-90’s, the name was finally changed to the Museum of Communication and a number of new exhibitions were permanently installed. Today there are still a variety of permanent displays that explore the history of communication through modern displays. Among the permanent exhibitions are the postal collection which includes everything from vintage postal trucks to mailboxes and even a special section focusing on stamps throughout history. There is also a section that turns its focus to new media and digital information that includes an impressive collection of video game consoles and accessories from Ataris to modern gaming PC’s. The connection between the evolution of stamps to video game development might seem a bit hard to make, but the Museum of Communication communicates it quite clearly.",postal video games museums and collections museums
61,Birthplace of the Web,"Meyrin, Switzerland",The World Wide Web was created in this nondescript corridor at CERN.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/birthplace-of-the-web,"It may look like any other hallway, but look closely and you’ll notice a historical plaque commemorating a monumental event in digital history: the birth of the web. The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee. The web, though omnipresent in the age of the internet, was originally meant to be a communication tool for scientists scattered at universities and other institutes around the world. Berners-Lee was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, when he developed the world’s first website. Though simple in appearance, this amazing technological feat revolutionized how we share and store information. The first website was dedicated entirely to itself: a white page bearing nothing but typed hyperlinks. It described the WWW project, as well as core features of the web like how to set up a server and access documents. It was hosted on Berners-Lee’s NeXT computer, which is still at CERN. In 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain. Interestingly, Berners-Lee faced some pushback for his invention, as some at CERN believed it was a waste of resources and wasn’t part of the organization’s core mission. Now, however, the organization at least marks the corridor where the web was born.  This is inside one if the CERN office buildings and not normally accessible to visitors.",internet inventors computers inventions universities plaques technology
62,Jungfrau Park,"Interlaken, Switzerland",A Swiss amusement park entirely dedicated to the theory of ancient astronauts.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jungfrau-park,"The town of Interlaken in the Bernese Highlands of the Swiss Alps is a popular destination known for its fresh air and picturesque mountains and lakes. And, since 2003, it has been home to an amusement park designed by the alien-obsessed Swiss author Erich von Däniken. Von Däniken came up with the idea for an amusement park back in 1997. It would be a place where his theories of ancient astronauts and paleo-contact could be appreciated and given the full respect they deserve, all in a fun and family-friendly atmosphere. And a few years later, an investment group actually agreed this was a good idea. The firm invested 43 million Swiss francs into the project, and Erich von Däniken’s Mystery Park was opened to the public in 2003. The park consisted of eight pavilions dedicated to various von Däniken hypotheses, with each pavilion designed to resemble its theme. Among them were the Nazca Pavilion (alien runways), the MegaStones Pavilion (aliens built Stonehenge), the Orient Pavillion (aliens built the Great Pyramid) and other pavilions focusing on ancient alien contact, the Mayas, and the Vimana and flying palaces. Basically, it was all aliens. Then there was a central pavilion called the Panorama Kugel, which was topped by a 135-foot sphere. The observation deck inside the Kugel provided views across the park, and contained exhibits of von Däniken’s works. The new park got off to a fairly good start, attracting almost 200,000 people in its first 100 days. But it didn’t take long before Mystery Park ran into a few problems. Firstly, some people thought it was an educational aberration that should never have existed in the first place. One of the more notable criticisms came from the Lausanne  architecture and engineering professor Anton Wasserfallen, who called the park a “scientific Chernobyl.” Such criticism meant little if the park made money, but that too became a problem. By the winter of 2004, mounting criticism was being directed at the park and its governmental backers, simply because financial expectations were not being met. The projected 500,000 guests per year were failing to show up, and in 2005 only 200,000 visited Mystery Park. The dire financial situation reached a climax in November 2006, when park operations were suspended indefinitely. But that wasn’t the end of Mystery Park. In 2009, the park was bought out by New Inspiration Inc., who renamed it Jungfrau Park. Von Däniken’s amusement park dream was still alive, albeit somewhat curtailed. Since its reopening, Jungfrau Park now only opens on a seasonal basis, and the financial situation has never reached particularly rosy levels. Still, if immersing yourself in spurious ancient alien theories sounds like a day well spent in Switzerland, you know where to go.  Jungfrau Park is located in the village of Matten bei Interlaken, about 28 miles southeast of Bern. By car, take Highway A8 and exit at Interlaken Ost, N. 26. If you go by train, get off at the Interlaken Ost terminal, from where you can take bus 103 to the park. In 2019, Jungfrau Park is open from May 4th to October 20th. Adult tickets cost 40 Swiss francs ($40 US) and 22 Swiss francs ($22) for kids.",theme parks oddities aliens strange science amusement parks space mystery

Although you could be forgiven for not knowing that since it appears to be a garish pink suburban home from the outside. This hidden stronghold was built in 1940 as part of a larger defensive line that is usually defined more by the miles of cement dragon’s teeth connecting 12 fortresses including the Villa Rose. The fortification itself looks like a harmless two-story home but instead of a nuclear family lounging inside, the false house held massive guns. The large green garage door could open to reveal two huge cannons which were assisted by a third hidden behind the shutters of a ground floor window. The whole thing was made of thick cement walls which were painted pink, apparently in an effort to make the fort seem even more harmless. There are even false windows on the second floor that are simply painted on the concrete. The Villa Rose had a companion fortress along the Toblerone Line known as the Villa Vert which was a similarly disguised battlement that was painted green. Both of the villas were just a couple of examples of “false chalets” built all around Switzerland during the war. Villa Rose is the best maintained example of these secret forts and is now open as a museum.  You can reach the pink villa easily by foot from the station, it's about 20 minute walk.",secret forts hidden eccentric homes military history world war ii homes military
64,Abandoned City of Pripyat,"Pripyat, Ukraine",The ghost town left by the worst nuclear disaster of all time is being taken over by nature and urban explorers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-city-of-pripyat,"When one thinks of Chernobyl, a vacation spot is certainly not the first thing to come to mind. However, more than three decades after the terrible reactor meltdown, tours of the contaminated towns surrounding the infamous reactor are gaining in popularity. On April 26, 1986, during a test to see how much power was needed to keep the No. 4 reactor operating in the event of a blackout, the No. 4 reactor of Chernobyl Nuclear Station exploded causing fire, which lead in the following days to huge damage of the building, releasing extremely dangerous amounts of radioactive chemicals into the air, which over time contaminated millions of square miles in dozens of European nations. The IAEA estimates that approximately 30 people were killed by the explosion and related radiation exposure, with several thousand additional deaths due to higher cancer incidence possible over the long term. The town closest to the No. 4 reactor was Pripyat, a city of 49,000 founded in 1970 to house workers from Chernobyl. It had 15 primary schools, a large hospital complex, 25 stores, 10 gyms, along with parks, cinemas, factories, a pool, an amusement park, and other marks of a thriving community. Because of the people who lived there, it was one of the most beautiful and luxurious cities in the Soviet Union. Only about three kilometers from the explosion, the entire city was forced to completely evacuate on April 27 in just three hours. It was possible only because this scenario was part of the building plans of the plant. Over three decades later, this ghost town is a freeze-frame of the Soviet Union in 1986. Communist propaganda still hangs on walls, personal belongings litter the streets and abandoned buildings. The hammer and sickle decorate lampposts, awaiting May Day celebrations that never took place. Toys are strewn about a schoolhouse where they were last dropped by children who are now fully grown. All clocks are frozen at 11:55, the moment the electricity was cut. Despite the common info, the city was never completely abandoned. Military, police, scientists, and other public authorities use the city as a base to clean radiation in the newly created zone of alienation. The famous pool was in service until 1996. There is still electricity in some part of Pripyat, and to this day there is a functional vehicle base in the city, water supply for the plant, and in the former laundry… there are still laundry after 30 years, where the uniforms of plants workers are washed. in the same building triangle radiation danger signs are made. Ironically, the absence of humans has been excellent for wildlife. In 1986 wildlife was not doing well in Chernobyl, outcompeted for resources by pine and dairy farms. After people left the deer and boar populations returned almost immediately, and despite having radiation levels thousands of times higher than normal, they were not showing obvious signs of mutations (though the plants got pretty weird including some actual glowing) and the animal populations grew enormously. After the elk, moose, deer, and boar returned so did their predators the wolves and lynx. Today the animal populations more closely resemble that of a national park than a radioactive containment zone. As it turns out, from the animal’s point of view, a nuclear disaster is preferable to normal human habitation. To tour Pripyat, Chernobyl, and other surrounding villages, one must first obtain a day pass from the government. These passes can be obtained through the touring companies located in Kyiv, about 110 kilometers from the blast site. There are five well-known tour agencies that take visitors to Pripyat. However, due to the lack of repair, the buildings and other structures in the town are becoming increasingly dilapidated. Because of this, many tour companies will not allow visitors into the buildings. Other than the crumbling buildings, safety is not a major concern. It takes between 300 and 500 roentgen per hour of radiation to deliver a lethal dose. Levels on the tour range from 15 to several hundred micro-roentgens per hour. All tours end with screening for radiation levels. Already, after only three decades of abandonment, Pripyat is beginning to be swallowed up by the surrounding forest. Someday soon, it will no doubt be completely overgrown.  1. Hostel Ukraine Kiev Backpackers (http://www.hostelukraine.com/en//kiev/disaster.html) This is the only hostel in Kiev to offer a tour. 2.

There is a visitor center with a model of the reactor however, and questions about the explosion will be answered there. 2. Pripyat is also on the list. Sites to see include the public schools, a hospital, a never opened fairground complete with ferris wheel, and many homes and apartments, all abandoned. However, most tours do not allow people inside buildings due to their unsound structural instability. 3. Up until April 2008, visitors were also taken to the vehicle scrap yard where military machines used during the radioactive clean up were dumped. The Ukraine government has deemed this vehicle cemetery unfit for visitors due to it still lethal dose of radiation. Vehicles included helicopters, trucks, and ambulances. However, some tours take visitors to a safer abandoned shipyard instead. Some tours include trips to other abandoned villages around the area and optional survivor guides upon request.

67,Odessa Catacombs,"Odessa, Ukraine",The largest catacomb system in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/odessa-catacombs,"In Odessa, when someone’s water line suddenly breaks, or a house settles oddly, or a family pet goes missing, it is not uncommon for Ukrainians to curse about “those damn catacombs.” They are not being delusional, for underneath their houses run some 2,500 kilometers of catacombs, carved into the limestone that the city is built upon. (To get a sense of how much tunnel system that really is, it is only 2138 kilometers from Odessa to Paris.) The date of the earliest catacombs in Odessa is difficult to determine (as they were all widened at a later date), but they likely date back to the 1600s, if not farther. However, the catacombs began to truly grow into their astonishing, labyrinthine form in the early 1800s, when the limestone quarried from them was used to build much of the city. Odessa’s catacombs quickly became the preferred hideout of rebels, criminals, and eccentrics. During WWII, although the Soviets had been forced out of the city, they left behind dozens of soviet-organized Ukrainian rebel groups hidden below the city in the expansive catacombs. Hiding in the catacombs for as much as 13 months, literally below the noses and feet of the Nazis above, the rebels waited for a chance to strike or relay information. These men and women would play chess, checkers, cook, and listen to Soviet Radio, generally trying to make a normal life below the surface of the city. They tried to ignore the malnutrition and malaria which afflicted many of them. Many of the partisan groups lived in the catacombs for the entirety of the rest of the war, and on occasion the partisan groups even managed to blow up German facilities. The Fascist Germans and Romanians meanwhile chose random catacomb exits and sealed them, hoping to trap the men below the city forever, and occasionally tossed poison gas canisters into the catacombs hoping to smoke the soviet rebels out. Once the war was over, the catacombs became home to numerous smuggling and criminal groups, who widened and created new tunnel systems of their own. In 1961, the “Search” (Poisk) club was created, headed by Constantine Pronin of the Paleontological Museum of OSU, and became the first official catacomb exploration unit, meant to explore the catacombs and help document the history of the partisan movement. Today there is an entire Ukrainian subculture of catacomb explorers with dozens of semiprofessional groups, often quite competitive, exploring the catacombs. They go on multi-day underground treks, known as expeditions, to document and map the system. Should someone get lost in the catacombs (as happens every couple of years), these groups put aside their differences and mount large search expeditions. They have rescued a number of children who have wandered into the catacombs. In September 1995, in honor of the 200th anniversary of Odessa, the record for the longest underground journey in the catacombs was broken by a 27-hour continuos journey of over 40 kilometers. (Had they walked in a straight line the journey would only have been 9.5 kilometers.) Shortly after this the mapping of a huge unexplored area of the catacombs known as “K-29” was begun. Partisan weapon caches such as rifles and grenades are occasionally still found within the tunnels, and about once every five years a body is found. On rare occasions these bodies are almost perfectly mummified, freeze dried by the cold, dry air of the tunnels. While most of the time the bodies found are from long ago, stumbling across old bones of soldiers and smugglers from more recent accidents has been known to happen. On January 1st, 2005, some Odessa teens decided to spend New Year’s night partying in the catacombs. However, in the drunken revelry a member of the group, a girl named Masha, became separated and lost in the catacombs. She spent three days wandering in the freezing cold and pitch black before she died of dehydration. It took two years before the police were able to locate her body and retrieve it from the catacombs. While going into the catacombs is not illegal, there is only one small portion of the catacombs that is officially open to the public, which can be seen at the “Museum of Partisan Glory” in Nerubayskoye, north of Odessa. It would be extremely dangerous to try and explore the catacombs on one’s own. However, professionals can be hired at the cost of 250 hryvnia per person, depending on the time spent underground, the complexity and length of the route, the number of tourists, and options for delivery to the site entrance to the underground area.",memento mori catacombs and crypts subterranean sites architectural oddities architecture

The museum’s slogan is “est dolendi modus, non est timendi,” Latin for “there is a limit of sadness, anxiety has no limits.” Outside the museum stands a tank, an ambulance, a fire jeep, and a military jeep. The entrance is a staircase lined with street signs which name every village affected by the disaster. Chernobyl had a population of 49,346 people living in 11,000 apartments, and as such evacuation was not immediate. The radiation on April 27, 1986, the day of the evacuation, was 400 - 1500 mR/h.

69,Darth Vader Statue,"Odessa, Ukraine","A monument to Lenin has been transformed into a statue of everyone's favorite black-helmeted, fool-choking Sith Lord.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/darth-vader-statue,"He was supposed to bring balance to the socioeconomic forces of industrialized society, not leave them in darkness! But — just like the prequels, before we even saw them — we all know how that turned out. The USSR eventually collapsed from outside intervention as well as internal opportunists and revisionists wanting to destroy the socialist model through “free Markets” and “Liberalization” and in the two-and-a-half decades since countless Soviet-era monuments have been scrubbed from cities and towns across the former Eastern Bloc. In April 2015, Ukraine formally passed a controversial package of “decommunization” laws requiring, among other things, the removal of communist monuments. However, for one particular Lenin statue in Odessa, a Ukrainian artist had other ideas. Located in an old factory courtyard on the outskirts of the port city, the statue was scheduled for demolition until Alexander Milov — a local artist whose work was featured at Burning Man in 2015 — proposed a different solution: encasing the existing Lenin statue within a new titanium facade, creating the world’s first monument to Darth Vader. The pose of the old statue has proven to be strikingly appropriate for the new subject; Lenin’s long coat has become Darth Vader’s flowing cape, and the former Soviet leader’s clenched fist now holds a lightsaber. This is not Lord Vader’s first foray into Ukrainian politics, as the Sith master put forward by the Internet Party of Ukraine as a candidate for prime minister in 2014 (the statue is not a project of the Internet Party, despite Milov’s past involvement with them). If you are in the vicinity of the statue and sense a powerful presence in the Force on your phone or other wireless device, that’s because a WiFi access point in concealed in the statue’s helmet, providing free internet to followers of the dark side (or whoever).  Odessa’s Darth Vader statue stands in a private courtyard surrounded by office buildings and factories at 28 Stovpova Street, on the outskirts of town. The entrance to the courtyard may be locked, so it’s best to check in with the security guard to the right of the main gate when entering. The guard on duty will likely speak little or no English, but he will definitely understand the name “Darth Vader.”You can also enter the courtyard through the office building to left of the supermarket. Again, mention ""Darth Vader"" to the guard on the reception desk and he will buzz you through.

The Most Expensive Galician Restaurant has astronomical prices, incredible character performances, and white glove service. And if you can’t afford it? Don’t fear; simply ask for a “90 percent discount” when you get the bill and see the price dwindle to something far more affordable. The restaurant, named for the historic Eastern European region of Galicia (not to be confused with the autonomous community in Spain), takes a little more work than most. For starters, you’ll need to bang on an apartment door and convince the fellow blocking the entrance that you’re worthy of entering the restaurant through his kitchen. He’ll try to turn you away, so you’ll need to be persistent. But when you’re able to get in, it’s well worth it for the gigantic, humorous, and elaborate restaurant. Be sure to visit both bathrooms, each featuring a toilet more stunning than the next. There’s plenty of Masonic imagery throughout the restaurant and, despite being in Ukraine, you’ll also notice some American Founding Fathers decorating the walls of the eatery. Depending on the time of day, musicians will be serenading you along with your meal. And what expensive restaurant is complete without a full-sized car inside? Unlike many other themed restaurants, the food (which includes traditional and modern dishes ranging from Lviv cheesecake to dumplings to steak) and the actors make it well worth it. Just be sure that when the bill comes you ask for the discount, otherwise the restaurant’s name will live up to its promise!  The restaurant is on the second floor. The apartment dweller at the entrance may appear confused first and turn you away. It's typically after the second or third attempt that you're allowed in through the apartment and to the restaurant. With the discount, a bill of $143 will come to $14.",masons expensive eats hidden restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars
71,Golden Gate of Kyiv,"Kyiv, Ukraine",A reconstructed medieval gateway that was the magnificent entrance to the capital city dating back to 1037.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golden-gate-of-kyiv,"In 1982, the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv marked the 1,500-year anniversary of its creation, and as part of the widespread celebrations that took place one of the city’s oldest monuments, the medieval Golden Gate, was restored and rebuilt. This proved a controversial decision as there was no accurate idea of what the original gate looked like, and there were calls to demolish the new structure and display the ruins of the original, which dates all the way back to 1037, during the reign of Yaroslav the Wise. In the 11th century, Kyiv faced the threat of invasion by a nomadic tribe that had stationed itself outside the city limits. Yaroslav managed to defend his city in the fierce battle that followed, but proceeded to increase its protection by building new fortifications around the area. As part of this plan, the Golden Gate or “Zoloti Vorota” was erected, and served as the main ceremonial gateway to the city. The entrance to the huge stone and brick structure was through heavy oak doors, leading to a secure passageway, and was crowned by a viewing platform and a small Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which in turn, was topped by a gilded dome, a possible reason for the gate’s name. It was damaged during the Mongol onslaught of the 13th century, but continued to be used. After it took a few more hits, efforts were made to repair the gateway, but when these failed, it was covered with earth in the 18th century, and this landmark disappeared from the cityscape for nearly half a century. In 1832, excavations were carried out and the crumbling ruins of the once-magnificent entrance were discovered. The walls and sections of the arch that remained were reinforced and protected. The structure that stands today is an amalgam of the original stone and brick remnants and the modern pavilions that were put up around them in the 20th century. A statue of Yaroslav the Wise was later added to the park surrounding the gate.",forts medieval statues ruins history
72,Abandoned Avanhard Stadium of Pripyat,"Pripyat, Ukraine","One of the most poignant ruins of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the local football team's stadium has been quickly reclaimed by nature.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fc-stroitel-pripyat-avanhard-stadium-abandoned,"Walking through the vast Exclusion Zone surrounding the stricken Reactor Number 4 in Chernobyl is a somber experience. Entire villages and towns have gradually begun to disappear and be reclaimed by nature. There are some 90 towns inside the Zone, but the most iconic and well-known is the worker’s city of Pripyat. Opened in 1970, it existed for just 16 years before being abandoned to a nuclear fallout a hundred times more lethal than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Pripyat was a youthful city; nuclear power was at the forefront of modern technology, and the average age of the 50,000 or so who lived in Pripyat was around just 26 years old. The city was built to be one of the most modern in the former Soviet Union, and geared to youth. It had nightclubs, sports centers, swimming pools, bars, and romantic cafes overlooking a lake. It also had a football team, the FC Stroitel Pripyat. Like many soccer teams throughout the USSR, the team was formed out of a group of workers, stroitel meaning “builder” in Russian. They were founded soon after Pripyat was completed, playing in the fifth tier of the Soviet football league pyramid, as well as competing in regional competitions. FC Stroitel, playing in the shadow of the newborn nuclear reactors, in white shirts with blue shorts and red stockings, had their best season in 1985, finishing second and looking good for promotion to the higher reaches of the Soviet league system. Their home ground was called the Avanhard Stadium, capacity 5,000, located a few hundred yards from the now-iconic empty amusement park on Sportyna Street. Walking through this silent city of ruins, past the crumbling apartment blocks, shopping precincts, and abandoned hospitals and schools is a haunting experience. But there is something especially poignant about seeing the places built for leisure and entertainment falling apart. Approaching the old stadium, you pass rusted floodlight towers, some toppled over, and into a perfect rectangle of tall trees, surrounded by a concrete moat. It takes a while to recognize that you are looking at the football pitch, surrounded by a running track. Not many places in Chernobyl show the startling reclamation of nature as much the height of the trees on the football field, which have sprung to over 30 feet in just as many years. On the far side of the old pitch are the remains of the main stand. You can still see the tunnel where the teams would have left the home and away dressing rooms to enter the pitch. Rows of rotting wooden benches line the concrete stand, leading up to the ruins of the covered press box. Midfield Magazine reported how on April 26, 1986, FC Stroitel Pripyat’s opponents for the upcoming weekend’s fixture, the magnificently Soviet named, FC Mashinostroitel, were preparing to leave for Pripyat. The sharp end of the season was approaching, and the two sides were scheduled to play in the semi-final of the Kyiv Regional Cup. A helicopter landed on FC Mashinostroitel’s training field, and a fraught-looking official informed them, “lads, go home, you’re not going to Pripyat tomorrow.” The cataclysmic events unfolding at Chernobyl meant no football team would ever play there again.",chernobyl soccer nuclear disaster areas disasters soviet history sports abandoned
73,Priest's Grotto,"Borshchivs'kyi district, Ukraine",A subterranean Holocaust refuge within one of the world's longest cave systems.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/priests-grotto,"Beneath an expanse of wheat fields within the remote farmland of Western Ukraine lies over 127,779 meters of explorable passageways, caves, an underground lake, and the secret to survival for 38 Jews who lived underground through one of history’s darkest eras. Several brave families of Ukrainian Jews lived for nearly a year within the surreal underground world of the Gypsum Giant cave system, the longest uninterrupted cave habitation known. Needing to conserve fuel and candlelight, they lit the cave only long enough to cook, spending almost all of their time in complete darkness. They struggled with sensory deprivation, isolation, the threat of starvation, and constant fear of being discovered for a year before finding a message in a bottle tossed into the cave which read “The Germans have already gone.” When the families emerged one little girl had grown so accustomed to the dark, that she had forgotten what the sun looked like and asked her mother to  “put out the bright candle, because it hurt her eyes too much.” With the end of World War II, their underground ordeal went untold for decades, with the survivors wary of exposing their hiding place for fear that a future need to retreat back into the earth would arise. Much of the massive cave system remained unexplored until the early 1990s, when Christos Nicola and an expedition of professional cavers discovered several artifacts suggesting relatively recent human habitation.  Since then, Nicola spent ten years researching the story and managed to track down remaining survivors, slowly unearthing the incredible stories of their life underground.  It is about 450 kilometers (280 mi) driving distance southwest of Kyiv, and about 5.5 kilometers (3.4 mi) south of the district seat of Borshchiv.",secret passages grottoes holocaust hidden subterranean sites caves ecosystems
74,Rodina-Mat : Mother Motherland,"Kyiv, Ukraine",340-foot statue built to honour the Heroes of the Soviet Union.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mother-motherland,"Standing proudly over the Kyiv skyline is the 340-foot tall, stainless steel Soviet Mother Motherland statue. Originally intended to be even taller, the sword of the statue was cut because it was higher than the cross of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, a renowned Orthodox Christian Monastery. She ranks 18th on the list of the world’s tallest statues. For a bit of comparison, The Statue of Liberty ranks about 42nd. Held in the statue’s left hand is a shield with the State Emblem of the Soviet Union. For a small fee, you can go up to the height of the shield for a breathtaking view of the Kyiv skyline. Below the towering statue in its base is a Memorial hall that displays the names of 11,600 soldiers and over 200 workers on the home-front, honored during the war with the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The statue is part of the Museum of the History of Ukraine in World War II (until the law changed in 2015 it was known as the Museum of the Great Patriotic War) and standing on top of the hill she is the piece de la resistance. However, with the entire complex covering 10 hectacres and with over 300,000 exhibits it is the largest museum in Ukraine. Setting aside adequate time is very much advised. The entrance to the complex is typically Soviet; bold, large and imposing with sculptures depicting courageous struggles against German invasion, Nazi occupation and, of course, the devotion of the partisans to the party’s cause. The outdoor complex is complete with a plentiful array of carefully arranged tanks, trucks, aeroplanes, helicopters and other assorted vehicles and weapons, all of which can be enjoyed whilst listening to a gloomy soundtrack of Soviet music. The museum is large, dimly lit and does not shy away from the atrocities that took place in Ukraine. Rodina Mat’s construction (1979-1981) was controversial due to the massive costs that many believed should have been put towards more worthy or better causes. Controversy has not left the steel Mother with many people feeling that she should be torn down and her materials better utalised as she is a symbol of the Soviet State and communism. As recently as 2015 the Ukraine parliament, in an attempt to move away from the days of communist oppression, have outlawed Soviet and communist symbols. World War II monuments are exempt from the legislation and as such, because Rodina Mat and her surroundings are Soviet war memorials, her future looks safe. The museum's content and overall atmosphere is heavy. Save the trip up Rodina Mat until the end so that the views and the fresh air can blow some of the depression away.",soviet history monuments statues
75,All Saints Church,"Hodovytsya, Ukraine",The ruins of an abandoned church loom within a picturesque Ukranian village.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/all-saints-church-and-cemetery,"In the Ukranian hamlet of Hodovytsya, cute brick houses line the main road, which links small family farms and miles upon miles of lush green fields. A short walk here will reveal more picturesque gems that hint at the area’s turbulent past. Before World War II, this part of Ukraine was within Poland’s eastern borders, and the community here used to be a mix of Polish and Ukrainian. The Poles were generally Roman Catholic and the Ukrainians mostly Greek Catholic (Eastern-Rite Catholics who practice Orthodox ritual but recognize the authority of the Pope). Given the similarities between the two denominations though, some churches in the region were reportedly attended by both Polish Catholics and Greek Catholic Ukrainians, who would often go to mass together. All of this has changed during the war and then shortly afterward, when national borders were redrawn and people were forcibly displaced from many regions across central Europe. All these messy and tragic relocations left behind traces of the disbanded communities in their former homes, mostly in the form of cemeteries, old houses, monuments, and places of worship. Hodovytsya is no exception. The ruins of the All Saints Catholic stand quietly by the side of a placid lake, making for an impressive sight. The old church is an example of late Baroque architecture and features some heavily damaged frescoes dating back to the 18th century. Sadly, the church was all but destroyed by a fire in the 1970s. The entire roof is gone, but both its interior and exterior are still ornate. There are virtually no Catholics left in the area, so the church has never been restored, but it is open to the public for half an hour each week. While in the village, be sure to check out the graveyard as well. The cemetery here is half-Ukrainian and half-Polish. The Polish part features some beautiful gravestones and sculptures, but it remains largely abandoned since the Polish community left in the 1940s. The cemetery is kept periodically maintained, but as the Polish part is not frequented, most of the graves are overgrown. Someone has recently tied white-and-red ribbons to the Polish graves (the colors of Poland’s national flag), so that they can be more easily identified. There are some beautiful sculptures here, mostly of angels, although many of them have suffered weather damage.  Hodovytsya and the surrounding villages can be reached easily by regular buses from Lviv. Take a bus to Hodovytsya, then walk along the main road towards Basivka. For the All Saints Church, you will need to take a small road on the left (going slightly downhill). As of June 2018, the church was open for visitors on Sundays at 3.00 p.m., for 30 minutes only. For the cemetery, go back to the main road and again follow it in the direction of Basivka. The cemetery will also be on the left. You can then continue to Basivka and take a bus back to Lviv from there.",cemeteries churches abandoned sacred spaces ruins

Since 1735, Under the Black Eagle has tended to the apothecary needs of Lviv’s citizens, making it the oldest operating pharmacy in Ukraine. But since 1966 it has offered more than just medicine. The front room of the Under the Black Eagle is still a functioning dispensary, and it’s here that the pharmacy museum tour begins. Museum visitors can walk through 16 rooms to different historic eras of medicinal care, going back in time as they retreat further into the building. After paying a small entrance fee to the pharmacist, the pharmacy opens up to a wood-shelved room chock full of antique pharmacy equipment. There are mortars and pestles, various beakers, ornate scales, jars containing tinctures, elixirs, and other medicines, all from the 19th and 20th centuries. The material room contains the equipment for manufacturing medicine in earlier times (pill machines, drying cupboards, extraction presses, recipe manuals, etc.). In a replica brewery the pharmacy still offers its “iron wine,” an ancient iron-boosted beverage said to raise hemoglobin in the blood. An outdoor courtyard with an attached 17th century apartment shows what the yards of Lviv’s upper middle class looked in that time period. The pharmacy also boasts one of the most comprehensive medical libraries in Eastern Europe, with over a thousand ancient medical texts and even more books from the 18th to 20th centuries. In the basement, visitors can see one of the earliest forms of pharmaceutical studies: an alchemist’s laboratory. Oak stairs from the courtyard lead to this secret dungeon, where rare plants that would have been used in this seemingly magical room hang around the walls. This exhibit details the beginnings of medicine throughout Ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.

To operate the radar system, a small secret city was built, in which 1,000 people lived. The structure broadcast a sharp tapping sound which earned it the nickname “Russian Woodpecker.” It was such a powerful system that the sounds disrupted legitimate radio broadcasts and communications all over the world. While many people worldwide had theories as to what was causing the noises, the source wasn’t confirmed until after the fall of the Soviet Union. The site at Chernobyl remained in operation after the disaster, but in 1987, most of the technical equipment was moved to a site at Komsomolsk na Amure. Today, the mega-structure is still there, just a few miles south of the infamous Chernobyl reactor. There are plans to install wind turbines on it.

84,'Monument of the Third Angel',"Chernobyl, Ukraine","The biblical sculpture honors those who lost their lives, homes and communities to the Chernobyl disaster.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/angel-monument-chernobyl,"A lonely angel stands at the entrance to Chernobyl’s ‘Wormwood Star Memorial Complex,’ a trumpet pressed to his lips in a silent song. The sculpture, created by Ukrainian artist Anatoly Haidamaka, is a poignant tribute to those who perished in one of the world’s worst nuclear disasters. On April 26, 1986, a safety test on a reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near Pripyat, Ukraine, went terribly wrong, resulting in a steam explosion followed by an epic inferno. The area was rendered an apocalyptic hellscape, with flames licking the nuclear plant for 10 straight days. Radioactive smoke swirled through the air, surrounding the firefighters dispatched to combat the blaze. Many of the firefighters, or liquidators, were unaware of the true nature of the task, at first believing it was another ordinary fire. They battled the flames, their skin blistering as their insides roiled, their immune systems weakening as their bone marrows struggled to produce infection-fighting white blood cells. Twenty-nine people died from acute radiation sickness in the days after the disaster, with hundreds more falling ill in the weeks to come. The Monument of the Third Angel was installed as part of the new memorial park in Chernobyl on April 26, 2011 – the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. The grand opening ceremony was attended by the presidents of both Ukraine and Russia. Just beyond the angel begins a memorial path, decorated with the names of the region’s evacuated villages, and honoring all those people who lost their lives, homes and communities in the aftermath of the catastrophe. The name of Haidamaka’s monument refers to a local folk belief, which became popular in the region after the disaster, and was rooted in a passage from the Biblical New Testament (Revelation 8:10-11): “And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from Heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.” While English-language Bibles translate this name as “wormwood” (Artemisia absinthium), in local Ukrainian and Russian Bibles the name of the star is “polyn” – a word which here is used interchangeably for numerous plants within the larger mugwort or Artemisia family. “Chornobyl” (the plant from which the town takes its name) is one such polyn. As a result of this connection, many local Christians believed that the disaster had been foretold by their Bibles. One of these believers was the rector of Chornobyl’s Church of the Prophet Elijah, Archimandrite Sergius, who also recalled an omen seen in the sky ten years before the disaster: “Many locals saw a cloud fall to the ground so that the outline of the figure of the Blessed Virgin Mary became clear on it… In her hands She held bunches of dry polyn, which we call chornobyl. The Mother of God dropped polyn over the town… Only years later, after the accident, did it become clear what this sign foreshadowed.” Anatoly Haidamaka created his Monument of the Third Angel to honor the lives that were lost to the disaster, but also, something more intangible as well. By focussing on a story that was important to these people, the monument also aimed to embody a sense of the folk culture of this region. Even amongst so many other monuments to the disaster, Haidamaka’s angel stands out as a profoundly human tribute to Chernobyl’s lost communities.   It's possible to visit the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, though tours are tightly regulated.",chernobyl nuclear disaster areas disasters ghost towns monuments sculptures
85,Museum of Unnecessary Things,"Kyiv, Ukraine",A Kyiv-based repository for all manners of discarded curiosities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-unnecessary-things,"Kyiv’s Museum of Unnecessary Things (also referred to as the Recycled Materials Museum and the Museum of Antiques) breathes new life into jettisoned objects. This is where trash is given a second chance, treated as treasure off the beaten path. For those who seek an alternative museum experience, the Museum of Unnecessary Things in Kyiv exhibits junk, for lack of a better word, free of charge. From old sunglasses to dusty instruments and rusting machines, the Museum of Unnecessary Things displays an untold number of odds and ends, though according to City Card, over one million items have made their way to this unusual attraction since it opened in 1943. If old boots and crusty tools don’t pique your interest, this peculiar locale also houses a few once-groundbreaking historical inventions; including the world’s first vacuum cleaner, a gramophone, and the prototype of an early walker.  The museum is fittingly located on the grounds of the Kievgorvtorresurs recycling plant. The museum is closed on Saturdays and Sundays. You need to see the friendly security guard to get let in.",
86,Lysa Hora (Bald Mountain),"Kyiv, Ukraine",This hill is known for its connection to the occult in Slavic tradition.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lysa-hora-bald-mountain,"With its lush trees, bright blooms in the spring, and beautiful views of Kyiv, Lysa Hora (which translates to “Bald Mountain”) is a lovely spot for a picnic that also has links to witchcraft, satanic worship, and political executions. Lysa Hora is one of the mystical “bald mountains” of Ukraine. According to folklore, witches would gather for their Sabbath ceremonies at these hills and be joined by crows, eagles, and paranormal creatures. References to the pagan uses and mystical significance of the bald mountains are found in various texts and literature, including stories by the Ukrainian writer Nikolai Gogol and the Strugatsky Brothers. In 1872, the Russian army built a small fortress on the hill, but due to its location and relative isolation, it was soon converted into a storehouse. Between 1906 and 1917, the site was used for executions of political prisoners of the Tsarist regime—about 200 in total. The most notable execution that took place was that of Dmitry Bogrov, an anarchist and informant who assassinated the Russian Minister Pyotr Stolypin in 1911. The park has also at times been home to Roma refugee camps, which gained international attention in 2018 when far-right radicals attacked the campers and burned their tents. Today, the mountain is a nature reserve and part of the Fortress Museum area. It continues to attract practitioners of paganism and satanic worship. Carved wooden statues of pagan deities have been erected and can be found throughout the park.  From the Vydubichi metro station, pass to the southwest (in the direction of Koncha-Zaspa) a few hundred meters. The bald mountain is quite visible because of the treeless edge and the towering cross on it. Go up the path. Look around - the Left Bank of Kyiv is plainly visible. Then go deep into the grove where you can find the pagan symbols and the entrance to the underground city.",satanic worship paranormal occult witches witchcraft mountains
87,Kyiv Monastery of the Caves and Microminiature Museum,"Kyiv, Ukraine",This 1000 year old relic-filled cave monastery and UNESCO World Heritage Site also hosts an amazing micro-miniature museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyiv-monastery-of-the-caves-and-microminiature-museum,"The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra in Kyiv, Ukraine is many things. Also known as the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves, first and foremost it is a historic Orthodox Christian monastery, built on top of a massive series of tunnels. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the one of the largest museums in Kyiv with many sub-museums held within it. Though from a distance it looks like a standard orthodox church it is built on top of a huge and “very complex system of narrow underground corridors” that contain monks’ living quarters. Travelers in the 16-17th century wrote that “that the catacombs of the Lavra stretched for hundreds of kilometres, reaching as far as Moscow and Novgorod” which, though an exaggeration, helped make the complex famous. The catacombs also contain numerous burials and relics, such the bodies of mummified saints such as Saint Kuksha, Nestor the Chronicler, and Alipy of the Caves, which today are displayed covered with cloth. Among the museums in the above-ground complex are the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, a book and print history museum, a museum of Ukrainian folk art, a theater and film arts museum and the state historical library, but by far the strangest and most curious of the museums is the microminiature museum. This too has a Ukrainian connection, as the micro miniatures are the work of the world microminiature master Mykola Syadristy. Syadristy was born in Ukraine in 1937 and has been crafting micro-miniatures since he was in his twenties, or for nearly forty years. Among his creations are the words “Long Live Peace” in Ukrainian engraved on a human hair, minuscule portraits of Ernest Hemingway and Yuri Gagarin, and what is believed to be the world’s smallest book with 12 pages at an astonishing 0.6 square millimetres, each page filled with the writing and illustrations of Syadristy himself. Among the other items to be seen (all of which must be viewed through a microscope) are a golden chess set on a pin head and the picture of Russian composer V V Andreev etched onto glass and fitted into one half of a poppy seed.",microminiature art catacombs unesco relics and reliquaries miniatures memento mori catacombs and crypts subterranean sites caves ecosystems sacred spaces
88,Pidhirtsi Castle,"Pidhirtsi, Ukraine",One of the most valuable palace-garden complexes in the eastern borderlands—and one of the most haunted.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pidhirsti-castle-2,"Ukraine is a country filled with legends and mysticism. One of the most interesting places is Pidhirsti castle. It’s also known as one of the most haunted castles in Ukraine. Tales surround a mysterious lady in white, whose spirit is said to still wander around the castle. It’s believed the lady’s name is Maria Zhevuska, the wife of Zhevuski Duke. Apart from its ghostly history, the castle is massive and has been restored many times over the years. The castle was constructed around 1640 by a French-Polish architect in cooperation with an Italian architect. The Renaissance influence can be seen in the design of the round church in front of the castle. It’s enriched by statues of saints carved out of local dark sandstone. The castle was sieged several times over its lifetime and was even set ablaze. At the end of World War II, this region, previously part of Poland, was annexed to Ukraine and the castle became a tuberculosis sanitarium, until the fire nearly destroyed it in 1956. Today it belongs to Lviv Art Gallery and can be visited anytime, although it’s still abandoned and in bad condition.  The basement, which holds a “ghost residence,” is not free but can be seen by purchasing a ticket. The church is free to visit.",castles legends history & culture architecture
89,Canteen 19,"Chernobyl, Ukraine",The dining hall that nourishes workers in Chernobyl's Exclusion Zone is also open to visitors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/canteen-19-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-restaurant,"On April 26, 1986, a reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded, causing the world’s biggest nuclear power disaster. The explosion and the immediate effects of radiation exposure killed dozens of plant workers and first responders, and scientists still dispute the total number of nearby residents who have died from exposure-related cancers since. Today, forestry workers, biologists, and construction crews continue efforts to dismantle the damaged reactor and remove waste in the surrounding 1,000-square-mile Exclusion Zone. When they’re ready to take a break and eat, many of them head to Canteen 19. The Exclusion Zone’s most popular dining hall, the Canteen offers a menu of solid Easter European fare, including borscht, schnitzel, kompot, and sweet, cream-filled crepes. (There’s a coffee machine promising a caffeine kick with dessert, but don’t get your hopes up: It’s often out of order.) In addition to keeping Chernobyl workers nourished through the long cleanup, the Canteen welcomes the tour groups that venture into the Exclusion Zone on Ukrainian government–sanctioned trips. To enter the Exclusion Zone in the first place, guests must sign up for a tour or hire a private licensed guide, have their passports checked beforehand by the Ukrainian government, and pass through a military checkpoint an hour and a half from Kyiv. Tour guides lead groups through eerily empty streets, lined with the remains of villages evacuated after the explosion. Pripyat, a Soviet model city built to house power plant employees, then abandoned to nature following the explosion, is filled with the remnants of those who lived there, from a school with scattered Soviet-era posters to children’s shoes, left when their owners fled. Guests must enter the cafe through a radiation detector. The inside of the restaurant itself is strangely banal, its institutional lunch-line serving style familiar to anyone who’s eaten in a grade school cafeteria. For many visitors, however, the best part of Canteen 19 isn’t the cafeteria itself, but the gaggle of puppies that congregate outside. The descendants of pets left behind in the evacuation, they’re mostly gentle and known to have friendships with tour guides and workers (visitors, however, are warned not to touch them, as there’s a small chance radioactive particles may cling to their fur). They’re a reminder that even in places that have known tragedy, the best things about humanity—filling food and friendship with our animal compatriots—prevail.

Little latrines and lavatories fill the space, offering a fun, quirky look at an often taboo part of everyday life. Kyiv’s Toilet History Museum is flush with toilet tidbits and facts you probably didn’t learn in a history class. You’ll discover how toilets looked 5,000 years ago, why medieval toilets were called “wardrobes,” and how a toilet invented by Leonardo da Vinci functioned (though there are some doubts about this latter contraption). The toilet museum covers the many types of commodes throughout history, from Egyptian limestone toilet seats to the mechanics of a modern-day loo. It aims to explore culture and history through the lens of an everyday experience shared by people around the world. The museum contains the largest collection of toilet souvenirs in the world. Among the 580 toilet trinkets, you’ll find traditional statuettes of the porcelain throne as well as various ashtrays, key rings, lighters, and tobacco pipes in the form of a water-closet. Be sure to keep an eye out for the humorous bathroom signs, too. You can also see different toiletries, like the tools and contraptions people once used instead of soap.

91,Holodomor Victims Memorial,"Kyiv, Ukraine",The haunting complex honors the millions of Ukrainians who died in the forced famine under Soviet rule.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/holodomor-victims-memorial,"Set on the banks of the Dnieper river in lush parkland is a hauntingly beautiful memorial to a horrific episode in history, the Holodomor. Entering the park past the guardian stone Angels of Sorrow, visitors can hear quiet but clear chimes, and your eye is drawn to the soaring Candle of Memory memorial atop the underground Hall of Memory. It was not until 2006 that the Holodomor, a devastating famine which took place in the Ukraine region of the Soviet Union, was recognized in the Ukrainian parliament as a deliberate act of genocide against the country’s people. The artificially introduced food shortage created under Stalin was at its peak in June 1933, with nearly 28,000 people starving to death every day. Estimates have put the total number of fatalities at approximately 7 million. Historians today believe the genocide was planned by Soviet leaders to quash any attempts at Ukrainian independence and prevent uprising from farmers who resisted collectivization (confiscating all private farms and livestock and making them government-owned) under the Soviet regime. In 2008, 75 years after the famine-genocide, a memorial to the victims was opened in Kyiv,  recognized as a national museum two years later. Inside the memorial complex is a striking statue named “The Bitter Memory of Childhood,” showing a young girl holding some wheat, a tribute to the most helpless victims of the famine: children. In the Blackboard Alley, boards list the names of the 14,000 villages and towns in Ukraine that suffered, many of whose residents remain nameless to date.  The museum is situated near the Kyev Pechersk Lavra. The museum is easily accessible by public transport, the closest metro station is Arsenalna Station. The museum is open every day from 10:00 until 18:00. Technical day is the second Tuesday of the month. General admission fee to the underground section of the museum (the Hall of Memory) is 16 hryvnas for adults, 6 hryvnas for children. Free entrance for children under 7 years old, museum workers, veterans, soldiers of ATO, conscripts, persons with disabilities (with certificate).

The castle is by far the primary reason for visitors to make the trek to Kamianets-Podilskyi, a city of 100,000 people situated along the Smotrych River in western Ukraine. Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle was a crucial defensive bulwark in western Ukraine for centuries, with an unparalleled record of repelling invaders from Cossacks to Ottoman Turks to Tatars. It also boasts the unheard-of feat of successfully resisting a staggering 51 attacks by the Mongol hordes of the 13th and 14th centuries. The castle at one time featured no less than 12 towers, though only 7 remain intact today. Still, what remains is impressive, as it sits picturesquely sprawled over the hillside across the winding Smotrych River. Inside, you can explore all the dark corridors, dank dungeons, stone passageways, battlements, towers that any castle junkie could hope for.  After crossing the bridge you approach the entrance to the castle, pay a nominal fee and you're inside. If you don't have your own vehicle to reach the city of Kamianets-Podilskyi, there are buses available from all major cities of western Ukraine such as L'viv or Khmelnitskiy.",preservation fortresses castles medieval history

The topic had just started to be discussed publicly when this odd-shaped neomodernist concrete crematorium was built in Kyiv. Taking into account the sensitivity of the subject, architects designed the new structure to avoid any association with the process of cremation. It is sculpted from white concrete with curving lines meant be calming and therapeutic to any funeral attendees and mourners that gathered at the site. The uniquely shaped crematorium stands in Baikove Cemetery’s “Memory Park,” and a giant wall covered in reliefs was built right next to it. Called the Wall of Remembrance, it took 10 years to build, and then when it finally completed in 1982, authorities decided to cover up the reliefs. Today there are methods to remove the concrete that was added to mask the images, and now a small portion of the wall now reveals what lies hidden beneath.  The crematorium is located in Memory Park at the back of Baikove Cemetery.

Lifelike statues chiseled with painstaking detail stand by some of the plots like stone guards. Sculptures of angels draped in delicate, flowing robes adorn some graves, while well-muscled men top others. Opened in 1786, the sprawling cemetery is older than famous graveyards like the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and and London’s Highgate Cemetery. It was originally reserved as the final resting place for Lviv’s upper class residents. The bones of many of the city’s wealthy politicians, scientists, and artists lie within the soil. There, you’ll find the plots of famous Ukrainian figures like poet, journalist, and activist Ivan Franko; composer Stanislaw Liudkevych; and opera singer Solomiya Krushelnytska. Because the graveyard catered to a wealthy crowd, the older parts of it resemble a grand sculpture garden or open-air museum. The cemetery once held even more masterpiece sculptures than it does today. But unfortunately, many were destroyed when the city was annexed by the Soviet Union after World War II. This saw a great number of the city’s pre-war Polish residents expelled and almost 2,000 of the graveyard’s historical monuments and sculptures destroyed. Thankfully, much of the destruction stopped after the cemetery was declared a historical monument in 1975. There are other more modest graves speckled around the grounds, too. A lot of these simpler plots date back to the days when the city was under the control of the Soviet Union. The cemetery also contains sobering war memorials.

Dating back to the 12th century, the baroque church took 20 years to build, and features 5 naves, 5 apses, and 13 domed cupolas on a cross-in-square plan. The cathedral’s proximity to the Royal Palace made it a regular site of events like coronations and the signing of treaties. Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, during whose reign the cathedral was finished, founded Ukraine’s first library there. Many rulers have been interred in the cathedral over the years. Prince Yaroslav’s sarcophagus has been there since his burial, though his remains are believed to have been carried off during World War II. Between 1169 and the 1585, the cathedral changed hands many times and was significantly damaged. During its reconstruction in the 1600s and early-1700s, baroque details like pear-shaped cupolas were added, as were a bell tower, a residence for the Metropolitan (local church head), and ornamented western gates. It was during this time that the exterior was stuccoed and whitewashed and the central cupola was gilded. Frescoes and mosaics that date back to Saint Sophia’s origins decorate the interior. The most famous piece is the 20-foot stone and glass mosaic of the Virgin Mary praying, thought to be indestructible since it survived the centuries of punishment the church suffered.

97,Potemkin Stairs,"Odessa, Ukraine",Featured in one of the most iconic scenes in cinema history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/potemkin-stairs,"Based on the mutiny of the battleship Potemkin of 1905, the Soviet silent film Battleship Potemkin was directed by Sergei Eisenstein and released in 1925. It stands as a milestone in the history of cinema, its montage editing techniques ahead of its time. In 2012, the British Film Institute named it the 11th greatest film of all time, and it has been named as the favorite of Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, and Michael Mann, to name a few. One of the most famous scenes from Battleship Potemkin happens near the climax, which depicts the imperial soldiers massacring the civilians of Odessa. The sequence was famously paid homage to in Brian De Palma’s The Untouchables, also inspiring such films as Terry Gilliam’s Brazil, Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, and even Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Despite its symbolic status, this massacre is thought to have never happened in real life, the film essentially being a dramatized propaganda. Nevertheless, it made the stairway famous enough to rename it the “Potemkin Stairs.” Constructed between 1837 and 1841, the steps were designed by Italian architect Francisco Boffo and Russian architects Avraam Melnikov and Pot’e. They serve as a formal entrance to the city from the harbor side, and originally had 200 steps. A renovation in 1933 reduced the number to 192, with 10 landings. The stairway is also a carefully constructed optical illusion. It is designed so that a person looking down the stairs see only the landings, while a person looking up sees only the steps. During the Soviet era, the steps were renamed the Potemkin Stairs in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the famous mutiny. Following the independence of Ukraine, its original name “Primorsky Stairs” became official again, but the locals as well as tourists still refer to it as the Potemkin Stairs (or Odessa Steps) in honor of its significance in cinema history.",the soviet imprint cinema soviet architecture stairs war film locations military
98,Slavutych,"Slavutych, Ukraine",The last planned Soviet city was built for the former residents of Pripyat after the Chernobyl disaster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/slavutych,"The purpose-built city of Slavutych in northern Ukraine, near the border of Chernihiv and Belarus, was created specifically for the families forced to evacuate the town of Pripyat after the tragedy at Chernobyl, and survivors who worked at the nuclear power plant. It was the last city the Soviet Union created before its dissolution. After the disaster, architects from Ukraine, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan  came together to construct the town, which would house around 25,000 residents. Rather than design the city in a homogenous fashion, the project was planned so that each neighborhood was designed by an architect from one of the nations in a local fashion. Slavutych, therefore, is one of the most unique cities in the world architecturally speaking. In order to build atop the contaminated soil of the area, over six feet of fresh soil had to be laid before construction, which began promptly after the tragedy in 1986. In October 1988, the first residents moved into their new homes. Slavutych was built to be an affluent and prized place to live. The city’s construction ensured that the place had everything needed to give the children of the disaster a fruitful and promising life. The city has a variety of sports centers, youth and cultural centers, playgrounds, medical facilities, and even a hotel. The Slavutych train station still sends workers daily to their jobs at Chernobyl. The number of workers back in 2001 was 9,000, but that number has dipped to around 3,000 people who are still working at Chernobyl and living in Slavutych. The best way to get to Slavutych for a day trip is to base yourself in Chernihiv and take a marshrutka there. There are buses leaving hourly or every other hour to Slavutych from Chernihiv. Taking one back is just as easy. If you're looking for tasty food, check out a restaurant called Old Tallinn in the Tallinn Quarter at Tbilisskiy Kvartal 1. It is located in the city center and is the best place to eat in the city.

A visit to Kyiv is not complete without riding the metro. As well as boasting the world’s deepest station (Arsenalana), the metro system also has some of the most beautifully decorated and ornate stations in the world. Kyiv, a city known for its street art, has brought some of its artistic extravagance underground. The Osokorky metro station—once one of the more generic-looking metro stations—was chosen to house the “More than Us” street art project thanks to its dome-like inner structure. An international team of artists transformed the once-bland interior into a colorful feast for the eyes.

In 1941, when the Germans entered the city of Kyiv, a young Markus was there to greet them, congratulatory flowers in hand. Instead of graciously handing them over to the triumphant soldiers, she threw them, and the grenades hidden underneath them, at the approaching contingent, killing four soldiers. Her father threw a second grenade, to prevent them from retaliating. In the tumultuous times of war, father and daughter had become members of the Kyiv underground, resisting Nazi rule. But her father was caught and killed shortly after the grenade incident. Markus got further entrenched into the movement and took on the alias of Tatyana or Tatiana Markusidze, the daughter of a Georgian prince who had been killed by the Bolsheviks. With this tragic (fake) backstory, she purported to hate the Soviet Union and joined the Germans. A young beautiful operative, she won the confidence of several German officials and gathered information that helped the Ukrainian rebels kill them. She even worked in a German officers’ mess and often lured soldiers into isolated areas and killed them herself. With a number of Nazi soldiers dead, the Gestapo launched an operation to identify and catch her. As she was escaping, in August 1942, she was caught and interrogated brutally for more than five months, which intensified when her Jewish identity was discovered. But despite the torture, she refused to provide them with any information about her comrades. She was then killed in January 1943 and, according to some accounts, her body was thrown into the notorious Babi Yar ravine, where thousands were massacred by the Germans. A few years later, in 1946, a Communist Party district report dealing with the period of occupation included her and spoke about the “brave Komsomol girl who knew no fear, Tanya Marcus, who was known as Markusidze. An active member in the sabotage movement, she personally killed dozens of soldiers, officers, and collaborators. She carried out very responsible operations on behalf of the organization by preparing sabotage operations, etc.” After the fall of the Soviet Union, a statue of this courageous young woman who gave her life in the fight against the Nazis was unveiled in Babi Yar in 2009, just a few years after she was honored as a “Heroine of Ukraine.”  The coordinates are for Babi Yar park, within which stand memorials to victims of the massacre, including the statue of Tatyana Markus.",kickass women war memorial nazis women war history world war ii military statues

The Research and Educational Museum of Sexual Cultures of the World, the only museum of its kind in Ukraine, has rooms dedicated to the sexual cultures of diverse geographic areas such as Greece, Rome, Japan, India, China, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The museum has educational talks for married couples or those wishing to marry. It also has a room specifically for teenagers that has information on human anatomy and sexual behavior and also hosts lectures on sexual education that feature facts about sexually transmitted diseases and contraception. The museum was opened by employees of the Department of Sexology at the Kharkiv Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education in 1999. The private collection of one of the university’s professors was its basis. Visitors have to be at least 18 years old to enter. However, those over 15 are allowed into the area for teenagers. It can be quite difficult to find—it's around a corner in a back alley behind a red building.

Using the water of a living river, this gleeful feat of engineering creates underwater illumination from superpower LEDs to enhance the 70-meter central stream and splay colors across the water projection screen, stretching 16 meters across and 45 wide. One of the first fountains in the country to utilize mobile elements to drastically oscillate water streams, the Roshen Fountain dances like no other. However, one of the most interesting features of the fountain happens to take place underneath all of the flash and sound effects. The Roshen Fountain uses “Hibernation technology” to keep it safe and sound during the harsh Ukraine winter. On October 15th, the equipment is sunk to the bottom of the Southern Buh, the lake whose water it utilizes, and sleeps until the ice is gone, and the show can go on. Part of a complex project of Pivdenny Buh quay reconstruction near Roshen Confectionery Factory, who gifted the installation to the people of Vinnytsia, the fountain is a social and cultural project unlike any of other in Ukraine’s history built by a private business. On September 4th, 2011, the grand opening of the fountain attracted tens of thousands, and until the freeze comes, tens of thousands more can witness the spectacular shows on a daily basis.

In the early ’70s, the Polish gymnast Kasimir Jagelsky and mathematics professor Yuri Kuk decided to create a collective, open-air gym from recycled metal. The scraps, salvaged from old factories and landfills, were ingeniously repurposed to create rowing machines, leg presses, dozens of bench presses, and more. The name Kachalka is derived from the Ukrainian word kachat, which means “to pump.” Today, the gym remains popular with locals and visitors alike, and is open and free year-round. Enthusiasts maintain the gym, and continue to construct new equipment from whatever they can find.  The gym is free to use and is open throughout the year.",gyms recycling soviet history sports
104,Kyiv Institute of Information,"Kyiv, Ukraine","This exquisite, alienesque piece of Soviet architecture is being threatened by modern shopping malls.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/state-scientific-technical-library-of-ukraine,"The inspiration for the UFO-shaped Institute of Information, built in Kyiv in 1971, came from the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. But the shape was not only inspired by alien spaceships—it was also designed to be a unique venue for concerts and events. Florian Yuryev, an artist, architect, inventor, composer, musician, scientist, violinist, poet, and public figure active in Kyiv at the time, wanted to demonstrate the “synthesis of the arts” by combining color, light, and music. He even developed a theory around “color music” and how colors were perceived and could be combined in harmonies. Unfortunately, his work was never officially recognized by the Soviet authorities and the alienesque building was soon used as an ordinary movie theater at the institute. Today, the intriguing building is threatened by modern shopping malls being built in the area. It has still not gained any official status as a protected architectural monument, and the city of Kyiv claims it doesn’t have any money to repair or maintain it. For a building built during the Soviet era, this poses challenges, as the technology and materials used were of poor quality and the budgets were always small, meaning the structure is in definite need of modern maintenance. For the time being, the UFO-shaped Institute of Information is still there, squeezed between modern shopping malls. Fortunately, events like the 2017 Kyiv Biennial, which used the structure as a venue, show that there might be a future for the building after all.  The Kyiv Institute of Information is right next to the Lybidska metro station.",ufos soviet architecture soviet history architectural oddities architecture

It was originally built as an imposing fortress before being converted into a Nazi “Tower of Death.” The Maximilian Tower No.4, as the structure was originally known, is a circular red fort sitting on a hilltop overlooking the Ukrainian city of Lviv. It was constructed in the early 1850s as part of a program that would have seen similar towers erected in every capital city of what was then the Austro-Hungarian empire as a measure to deter civilian uprising via the ever-present reminder of the state’s military strength. While the tower was never used in military actions, when World War II broke out, the building was taken over by Nazi forces and turned into a relatively small concentration camp mostly for Soviet prisoners. Known as Stalag 328, the citadel served as a detention location for Soviet prisoners (among others). The Nazi policy for the treatment of Red Army soldiers was to starve them to death, which the prison did often and without compunction. During its occupation by the Nazis, over 100,000 prisoners are said to have been killed, earning the site the nickname, “Tower of Death.” After World War II, the site was abandoned to private usage until the early 2000s when the location was purchased by investors who converted the space into a lush, five-star hotel destination known as the Citadel Inn. The Inn continues to welcome guests with no plaque, signage, or indication of the building’s true history of fear and death. The hotel boasts a good restaurant on the last floor. There is also a nice viewing spot outside the hotel with a panorama of the city of Lviv.",nazis places to stay hotels world war ii military
106,Synevyr Lake,"Mizhhirs'kyi district, Ukraine",This stunning mountain lake was named for a pair of tragic lovers whose statues stand at the center.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/synevir-lake,"Also called the “Pearl of the Carpathians,” the crystal-clear Synevyr Lake is the largest and most beautiful lake in the Ukranian Carpathian Mountains. It has been named one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine thanks to both its picture-perfect scenery and the mysterious legends around its origin. The old Ukrainian legend tells of a local duke’s daughter, Syn, who had a majestic beauty and unusual blue eyes. She was the only joy for the duke, who lost his wife when Syn was born. Once, on a trip to the forest with her father, Syn suddenly heard the sound of a flute. It was Vir, a local musician. They fell in love at first sight and met each other many times after. When the duke found out about their secret relationship, he killed Vir. Syn rushed to her’s beloved’s grave, hugged a gravestone, and started to cry. At that very spot, the lake appeared, blue as her eyes and clear as her tears. And it was called Synevyr, or “Syn and Vir.” Today you can find Vir’s gravestone on the small island that sits at the center of the lake, along with two wooden sculptures depicting the lovers. But beware when exploring this alluring landscape: Another local legend tells about a werewolf (or “doghead”) who guards the nearby forest.  The easiest way to get to the lake is from the city of Lviv. Take the Lviv—Hust bus to the small town of Mizhhiria. There you will need to change to a bus that goes directly to the lake. The trip costs about 200 UAH ($6 USD).  There are plenty of small hotels and cafes are nearby. As the area is a national park and nature reserve, there are no campfires allowed.",love lakes legends natural wonders water nature statues
107,Pip Ivan Observatory,"Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine",Remains of a station that only operated for one year.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pip-ivan-observatory,"Sitting at the top of Pip Ivan (in Ukrainian, Priest John), or the Black Mountain, as some call it, are the remains of an observatory that was built several generations ago. Recognized as a monument of cultural heritage, the Pip Ivan Observatory was once part of Bialy Slon, an abandoned campus of the former Polish Astronomical and Meteorological Observatory. The area, which is incredibly remote, belonged to the Second Polish Republican back when the observatory was being erected in 1937. Completed the following year, in the summer of 1938, the Pip Ivan Observatory was an incredibly expensive construction project backed by the director of the Airborne and Antigas Defence League, the minister of military affairs, and a group of influential Warsaw astronomers. With walls build of local sandstone that had to be carried to the top of the mountain by local workers due to a lack of roads on-site, the observatory cost more than one million Polish zloty. Designed to look like a castle, the Pip Ivan Observatory, when completed, has 43 rooms and 57 windows. The upper floors were occupied by meteorologists and astronomers, most of them working for the State Meteorological Institute and Astronomical Observatory of the Warsaw University to carry out observations for the Polish Air Force. On the lower levels of the observatory, soldiers lived in special lodgings. In addition to all of the housing, the Pip Ivan Observatory housed a custom-made astrograph, a refracting telescope made by Grubb Parsons of Newcastle upon Tyne, and a special power plant with two Diesel motor-generators. Only a year after the observatory was completed, the Soviet’s aggression toward the eastern part of Poland led the astronomers and soldiers living at the mountain’s peak to pack the most important equipment and abandon the structure. Within weeks, the Red Army captured the building and used it as their own meteorological station. Over the years, the observatory housed a rotating group of troops. It was abandoned in 1944. Several groups offer hiking trips to the top of the mountain to tour what still stands of Ukraine’s highest architectural structure. Over the years, groups of professors and astronomers have raised the idea of rebuilding the observatory and putting it back into use.",instruments of science inventions architectural oddities architecture

From there, walk one kilometer into the woods and only the most intrepid of explorers will find the fortress of Tarakanov. Dating back to the time of Imperial Russia, the massive brick and mortar fortress was constructed during the 18th and 19th centuries to help protect the Lviv-Kyiv rail road and the surrounding area. Fast forward to the 20th century, the ruined fort has also been a set piece for the film industry, most notably for a scene from the film, Inglourious Basterds. Some locals maintain that the village is still inhabited by the ghosts of soldiers who died within the fort’s walls over centuries of occupation by Ukrainian, Russian, and German forces. During World War II, when German troops occupied the fort, there were rumors that Nazi scientists were using the space to conduct gruesome experiments on prisoners in a secret laboratory—with the aim of creating super soldiers. The massive fortress accessed through a hundred-meter long tunnel that was used to transport equipment into and out of the fort. Tarakanivskyy once contained room for lodging, stores, jails, a small church, and also a hospital. Tarakanivsky Fort now belongs to the Ministry of Defense. It’s hidden amongst the forest, and a visit feels as though stepping into another world. The ruins are free to explore, but there are spots that can be dangerous and requires great attention. A torch light or strong flashlight and proper footwear are highly recommended.  From the road in the village of Tarakanov, cross the railway, then turn right. Drive about 800 meters to the rise, then turn left. Travel approximately 100 meters and you will see a tunnel that leads into the fort.",forests hidden world war ii ecosystems military architecture

Created in the late 19th century by Polish sculptor Leandro Marconi, the statue is not like any other recreation of Lady Liberty, and not just because of her pose. While the lady has her traditional crown and torch, the reclining figure is also flanked by two strapping shirtless men, marking the first time in history that Lady Liberty has been shown to be getting any action, even if it is just a metaphor for workers or something. In addition, the model of the figure is a bit more exaggerated than the New York original, with a pointier crown and a more elaborate robe. Not everyone is so impressed with the figure however. Among the locals, the statue has been known to be called, “the lazy statue.” Given that it is the world’s only sitting Statue of Liberty aside from the ones on New York’s Help the Homeless posters, maybe they have a point. The building atop which the statue sits now houses the city’s Ethnography Museum, so if you find yourself going to see one of the exhibits, be sure to look up and take in the relaxed figure.",statue of liberty statues
110,Beer Belly of Ukraine,"Lviv, Ukraine",A peculiarly shaped brass sculpture hidden in a courtyard in central Lviv,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beer-belly-of-ukraine,"Hidden within an unsuspecting courtyard in the middle of Lviv, a peculiar golden-colored sculptural lump lies embedded in the cobblestones. Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that this is a brass representation of a portly man’s beer belly (although it is sometimes at first mistaken for a more unsightly anatomical reference!). Exactly whose belly served as the model is unknown at this point. However, the inscription that encircles the bulbous abdomen helps explain who put it there, and why. The inscription reads: “королівська Пивоварня пивний пуп україни,” which translates to “Korolivska Brewery beer navel of Ukraine.” Look up from the brassy belly, and you’ll see the welcoming entrance of the Korolivska (“Royal”) brewery bar and restaurant, a tourist-friendly establishment with pleasant drinking and dining rooms furnished in dark polished wood. Perhaps the statue was inspired by a loyal customer?

Koelbli has said that the egg will outlast the power plant by 1,000 years. Filled with letters from around the world, the sculpture is meant to function as a time capsule that will remain closed until the year 3000. The letters, Koelbli said, “express hopes of today and hopes for the future generations, for our children’s children.” They’re sealed inside of a secure drum that is identical to the ones used to dispose of and store radioactive waste. Koelbli brought the egg in from Germany. The idea behind it is that life will break through the egg and survive radiation.

The unbelievably lavish mansion was abandoned when Yanukovych fled to Russia in the wake of bloody protests following his government’s unpopular decision to strengthen ties with Russia instead of the European Union. Activists flooded (but did not loot) the newly unguarded property to see its long-suspected opulence for themselves, a disturbing contrast to the poverty of many Ukrainians. The estate was transferred back to state ownership that spring, and was officially a museum by the end of the year. The central feature is the luxurious “Honka” clubhouse. Yanukovych decorated the house and property with outlandishly decadent possessions, including a piano modeled after the one from John Lennon’s “Imagine” video, personalized brandy, a private zoo, an antique book that is likely the first book ever printed in Ukraine, a vintage car and motorcycle collection, a 3D movie theatre, countless paintings and sculptures, and ornamental duck houses. A replica of a Spanish galleon, which has a restaurant on board, sits in the property’s pond, nicknamed the “palace on the water,” and there is also a gazebo, a guesthouse, and a giant sculpture of a horse. The property is now a very nice park accompanying the museum. For nearly a millennium, the land of the Mezhyhirya Residence was home to a monastery. Following that it briefly served as an artistic commune, and in 1935 it became a regular state-run residence for political and military leaders. Yanukovych first moved onto the property when he became Prime Minister of Ukraine in 2002, and gradually increased his ownership of the surrounding lands and buildings, transforming them to fit his lavish lifestyle.",wealth dictators mansions houses homes parks museums

Following them provides panoramic views of the green hills surrounding Lviv, as well as an unusual look at ordinary people’s homes and abandoned industrial buildings.

You can reach the abandoned tracks from various points, just look at Google Maps where the tracks run near a road. If you decide to walk the whole length of the tracks (and starting on Polova Street) you will end up right next to Lyckakivska Street, a couple of miles east of Rynok Square.

It’s staffed by former troops from the 46th Division of the 43rd Rocket Army (“Nizhniodniprovskaya Order of the October Revolution, Red Banner”) who served at the base. When you arrive at the museum there is an introductory video and then a tour of the ground level command post, which has been turned into an exhibition and display area. On the grounds of the base are an array of missiles, launchers, fueling vehicles, and assorted military bric-a-brac. Among the dead nukes on the site is an SS 18 “Satan” missile. The Saran is a real doomsday machine, capable of carrying ten warheads of 750 kilotons each (the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima was 15KT, for comparison). The SS-18 was never stationed at the base, however. The silos controlled from this base housed medium-range nuclear weapons capable of destroying a fair chunk of central Europe. The highlight of the tour is a trip down into the command bunker itself in a tiny lift that grinds its way down the thirty-meter, twelve-story blast-resistant tube to the bunker where the two-man launch crew was based. The decommissioned launch room is much as it was back when it was still operational, with its chunky panels and screens. You can sit in the commander’s seat - and you can press the launch button. The guides don’t speak English, so if you don’t speak Russian or Ukrainian you are missing out on a lot of the background information.

Kyiv is a city that loves monuments or memorials to historical events and people who have shaped, struggled, and fought for their country over the centuries. Be it bronze sculptures or busts of the legendary artist/poet Taras Shevchenko, monumental steel structures commemorating war victories, a memorial for the victims of Holodomor, or statues of peeing boys, Kyiv has it all. In contrast to these large prominent and striking statues, however, there is a collection of mini sculptures scattered across the city.

The museum was opened in 1979 by Mikhail Sikorsk in collaboration with the academy of sciences. The museum started as a passion project of sorts, with the people involved talking to various Soviet and post-Soviet authorities to obtain items and other material for the museum. They were successful as now they have over 450 exhibits, all on display in five large rooms of the church. The exhibition is focused on the history of space exploration and shows various items that were really used for the programs, some of which have been in space. When visiting you can expect to find models of various spacecraft, parts of space ships, reconstructions of satellites like Sputnik,  a  rocket engine, and the spacesuit of Yuri Gagarin. It is also the home of the first Foucault pendulum in Ukraine. The museum also shows the modern part of space exploration and focuses on the achievements of the Ukrainian space industry. When it first opened, the museum was known as the Museum of World Science and Peaceful Space Exploration. It was renamed in 2003.

It was utilized as a prison until 1996. This dark place is now a museum that tells the stories of the bloody occupation by Nazi Germany, and the atrocities committed later by Soviet forces in Lviv. It’s a must-visit to understand the history of this storied city.  The museum is located on the site of a prison that was used at various times by the Astro-Hungarian gendarmerie, the Polish political police, and the police forces of the Soviet Union. As far back as the Middle Ages, the area that makes up modern Ukraine has been fragmented, contested, and occupied by a number of different powers. As World War I was ending, a conflict emerged between Poland and Ukraine that led to Polish occupation of Lviv. As Soviet power was established in the 1920s, Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union. During World War II, parts of Ukraine were occupied during Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. After the war, it took years for Ukraine to recover. In 1991, the country gained independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Exhibits throughout the museum highlight the generations of Ukraine’s struggle for independence and acts as a memorial to all those that perished engaging in the decades of conflict. It’s not a very big museum and is one of the less-visited sites around the city. However, it’s an impressive place to visit and takes guests through the single cells that were once occupied by prisoners, the office of the police, and the vast courtyard where many prisoners were executed near the wall. There are many individual histories written along a few panels on the walls of the prison, mainly in Russian, with some English translations. There are also images of young soldiers in the war fighting against Russia for the eastern part of Ukraine. The museum is located on Łącki Street and is often known as the Prison on Łącki Street.

Built in 1969 the metal and brick expanse is not the most secure piece of civil architecture and when several people jump on the bridge together, or strong winds strike the structure, it is known to shake violently. The first theory holds that this swaying (or wagging) was akin to that of a mother-in-law’s tongue, hence the descriptive name. The second, more accepted but no less colorful, story is that the local chairman who commissioned the bridge did so because he loved his mother-in-law’s pancakes, but she lived on the other side of the ravine, thus the bridge was built to facilitate the indulging of this appetite. The tradition of hanging padlocks on bridges and fences is a known European tradition and given the marital connections of the name, no matter which origin you believe, it is no surprise that it spread to the Mother-In-Law bridge. Due to the weight of all the locks and the weak construction of the bridge, the city continually removes the locks from the bridge and even built a large, metal heart on the Western end specifically to hang locks from. Despite this installation many young lovers still hang their locks directly on the bridge.  Heading from Primorska street, go to Vorontsov palace, and take a left. This will take you across the bridge and into old Odessa.",love locks

At least 30 people, mostly pro-Russian demonstrators, died in a fire inside the prominent building in May 2014. Horrified visitors tramp up and down the blackened stairs and through the scorched halls, hoping for credible answers that were promised by an investigation, even as those answers seem to disappear in the smoke. Some blame Ukrainian nationalists, some the pro-Russian demonstrators. A lot of people talk about gas and Molotov cocktails being used to set the blaze and most of them believe that because the fire spread so quickly and killed so many it was pre-planned. There are a lot of unresolved questions about what happened at the Trade Unions Building, but the undeniable fact is that at least 30 persons died here because of  a very complicated and ongoing regional conflict. All the levels of the building can be visited except the basement, which is closed. There are no risks left to visitors except for some rubble and debris on the floor. People are still coming here to mourn their dead, so  flowers and candles can be found all over the building, turning the charred building into a memorial.",exploration disaster areas

125,Monument to Orange,"Odessa, Ukraine","An artful memorial to 4,000 fateful oranges.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-orange,"For centuries, the Ukrainian city of Odessa has served as the region’s great trading port. But legend has it that it took a fabulous bribe to pave the way. The story goes that 18th-century Odessa wanted money to build their port. Unfortunately, when the new tzar Paul I took power in 1796, he diverted the badly-needed port money elsewhere. That left the city in limbo. As a result, town officials came up with an interesting solution. They imported 4,000 Greek oranges and sent them as an exotic gift to Paul I. Since Paul had never tasted oranges before, he was fascinated and impressed by the fruit. Paul I soon approved the money needed to construct the the port. In 2004, the city gained a monument in honor of those fateful oranges. A giant metal orange on wheels sits on a pedestal, resembling a carriage pulled by a team of horses. Inside, Paul I stands holding an orange up to his face approvingly. The monument is topped with sculptures of several iconic and well-known buildings in Odessa. Designed by Valery Balukh and completed by the sculptor Alexander Tokarev and the architect Vladimir Glazyrin, the sculpture is a monument to a monumental bribe.",fruit statues
126,Odessa Cable Car,"Odessa, Ukraine","Built in the Soviet era, this cableway system still runs gondolas from Odessa down to Otrada Beach.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/odessa-cable-cars,"Getting to and from some of the beaches in Odessa can be a bit of a hassle. Most of the city is located on hills and the slopes are partly covered with huge parks where motor vehicles are prohibited. You therefore usually have to go by foot along rather steep lanes to reach the shoreline. Luckily, there is a quirky, fun and a little bit scary alternative: Riding the Communist-era cable car connecting the upper part of town with Otrada Beach. Opened during Soviet times in 1971, the cableway system hasn’t changed much since then. Even though it has gone from state-owned to privately owned and has been regularly maintained, it now resembles a nostalgic relic of the past. In total, the fleet consists of 65 tiny open gondolas painted in bright colors and decorated with pictures of popular USSR cartoon characters and other themes for kids. Each cabin is designed to carry a maximum of two adults with small children. One-way, the 0.26 miles (425 meters) ride takes roughly six minutes. From a height of up to 121 feet (37 meters), there is a panoramic view of, among other things, the Black Sea, tennis courts, and dense thickets of acacias. Since the cable car never stops, you have to embark and disembark the gondola on the go. The average speed of movement is 4.6 feet (1.4 meters) per second. The Odessa Cable Car must not be confused with the Odessa Funicular, which is an inclined elevator that runs alongside the Potemkin Stairs.  The upper station can be reached by tram No.5. Get off at the Pyrohovska stop, walk under the Mauritanian Arch and then continue straight on for a few minutes until you see the cable car station on your right-hand side. Follow the signs saying Канатная дорога. The lower station can be found by the southern part of the Otrada Beach, near the small marina. Again, follow the Канатная дорога signs. As of 2022, the cable car is running daily during daytime (unless the weather is bad) and a one-way ticket costs 100 UAH (approx. €2.6). Children under the age of three or with intellectual disabilities ride for free. If you speak Ukrainian, you can call +380 68 350 6051 for more info.",cable cars cliffs soviet history transportation

Pripyat, the planned city next to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which opened in 1970, was the ninth such atomgrad built in the USSR to house nuclear power plant workers and their families. About 50,000 people were living in Pripyat when the Chernobyl Disaster happened in April 1986. The power plant was the largest employer in the city; the Jupiter Factory was second with around 3,500 employees. In 1980, it was decided that Pripyat would house a new electronics factory. Jupiter officially made cassette recorders and electronic components for home appliances here. In reality, it secretly produced semiconductor components for the Soviet military and housed test workshops for experimental robotic systems. When the Chernobyl Disaster saw Pripyat evacuated and abandoned, parts of the Jupiter Factory remained in use, primarily for radiological experiments. This went on until 1996, after which it was abandoned too. Today, the remains of the Jupiter Factory are a site of glorious disrepair, slowly being taken back by nature like the rest of the city around it. Much of what is in there has been picked over by scavengers. Presume anything that hasn’t is highly irradiated.  Ukraine is a war zone, so don't risk going there at the moment for obvious reasons.

Every surface of the 13th-floor hallway at 26 Radunska Street has been transformed by former resident Tatiana Pick, into a hallway to hell. Presumed to be one of the residents of the floor, the artist spent five years turning the walls, roof, and even the floor and garbage chute into the canvas for her very own psychedelic vision. Not everyone in the building was even on board with the transformation, but Pick didn’t ask for permission to begin with. The walls and roof of the hallway are covered in multi-colored bulbous skin that seems to have absorbed countless animal figurines, toys, plants, mirrors, glass orbs, undefinable textures, and obscure religious iconography. Despite the peculiarity of the objects embedded in the walls, nothing seems out of place in the hallway, because nothing seems in place to begin with. Only the doors of some apartments on the floor have been left untouched by the artist, but not all. Lost in the fantasy, it’s easy to forget you’re standing in a functioning apartment hallway, with people living regular lives in regular apartments, right on the other side of this mysterious and disturbing dream world. Update: Due to refurbishment of the building the hallway has been completely replastered and very little of the art remains.   26 Radunska St is a private apartment building.

The collection began when a resident of one of the surrounding apartment blocks at 1 Mukachivska St found two lost toys nearby, and placed them under a small roof in the shared courtyard, in case the owner returned to collect them. The owner never did come back, and an unlikely shrine to lost things was born. Ever since, the little corner has attracted all manner of junk and former plaything, creating a melancholy little space that is nonetheless fascinating for its bittersweet looks. In the years since, the collection has grown as residents of the apartment blocks surrounding the yard have given a temporary home to hundreds of plush animals, dolls, musical instruments, figurines, and bicycles. One of the things that makes this amazing little found museum all the more stunning is the fact that all of the found items are arranged like they  are part of some little shrine. Rather than being carelessly tossed into a pile in the corner, the various toys and tchotchkes are placed on rickety shelves and pieces of furniture.

133,Highgate Cemetery,"London, England",London's creepiest cemetery was once the site of dueling magicians and mobs of stake-carrying vampire hunters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/highgate-cemetery,"Opened in 1839, Highgate is one of London’s most infamous cemeteries, originally opened as one of the city’s “Magnificent Seven” park cemeteries. The initial design was carried by architect Stephen Geary. Among the impressive Victorian and Egyptian influenced tombs are the gravestones of Karl Marx (recognizable by the glowering bearded bust); sci-fi author Douglas Adams; James Holman, a sightless 19th-century adventurer known as “the Blind Traveler” (a pioneer of “human echolocation,” he was able to sense his surroundings by the reverberations of a tapped cane or horse’s hoof-beats); and Adam Worth, a famous criminal and the possible inspiration for Sherlock Holmes’s nemesis, Professor Moriarty. Comprised of Kensal Green, Highgate, West Norwood, Abney Park, Nunhead, Brompton and Tower Hamlets cemeteries, the Magnificent Seven were created in 1832 as part of an effort to move burials out of the City of London in response to the twin pressures of the health concerns about overcrowded churchyard cemeteries, and desires for build-able land in the rapidly expanding city. The cemetery’s tombs and buildings are constructed in an imposing Victorian Gothic style and during the mid- to late 1800s it was a highly sought-after burial ground. However, by the end of WWII the cemetery was overgrown, unattended, and in serious disrepair, all of which added to its creepy feel. In the 1970s the infamous cemetery became the location for another English Gothic tradition, the horror films of movie studio Hammer.  These films regenerated public interest in the cemetery, and stories of grave robbing, desecration, and vampires in Highgate began appearing in the news. As described in the book Beyond the Grave, “Many claimed to see a particular creature hovering over the graves. Scores of ‘vampire hunters’ regularly converged on the graveyard in the dead of night. Tombs were broken open and bodies were mutilated with wooden stakes driven into their chests. These stolen corpses, turning up in strange places, continuously startled local residents. One horrified neighbor to the cemetery discovered a headless body propped behind the steering wheel of his car one morning!” Known as the Highgate Vampire Sensation it culminated in 1970 with two magicians, Farrant and Manchester, claiming that each would be the first to find and kill the supposed vampire. Manchester announced an official vampire hunt, and on Friday the 13th, “a mob of ‘hunters’ from all over London swarmed over gates and walls into the locked cemetery, despite police efforts to control them.” The two magicians were supposed to settle the debate with a “magicians’ duel” but it never happened. Farrant was arrested in the churchyard next to Highgate Cemetery with a crucifix and a wooden stake and in 1974 was jailed “for damaging memorials and interfering with dead remains in Highgate Cemetery.” Though neither magician found the supposed vampire, in the various “hunts” graves were ransacked and real corpses were indeed staked and beheaded. The debate between Farrant and Manchester continues to this day, while the cemetery remains a popular location for occult, paranormal and vampiric enthusiasts.  Both the West Highgate section, which is the most overgrown, and the East Highgate section, including the grave of Karl Marx, can be explored on your own, but you need to pay an entrance fee. There are guided tours available for both sections. You need to book entry tickets ahead of time for the West Highgate section. The cemetery gates are open to visitors daily from 10 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m. (depending on the season). From Underground stop Archway (not Highgate). On leaving the station, turn left and walk up Highgate Hill (past the Whittington Hospital) until you get to St Joseph's Church (obvious by its large green copper dome). Enter Waterlow Park on your left and go downhill across the park (past the duck ponds) to the Swain's Lane exit (below the tennis courts). The walk takes about 20 minutes. Note: photography is strictly limited in the cemetery. From their website: ""Ticket price includes permission to take photos for personal use only. Video cameras and the use of tripods are not permitted.

This covered Victorian market is one of the oldest markets in London, selling meat and fish as far back as the 14th century. The current green and red roof, however, was constructed in 1881 and made Leadenhall Market a popular attraction in London. The marketplace was featured a few times in the Harry Potter series—it was the film location for some of the original exterior shots of Diagon Alley, the cobblestoned shopping hub of the wizarding world where Hogwarts students can stock up on school supplies like spellbooks and wands. Today if you wander down the market’s Bull’s Head Passage you may recognize the blue door of an optics shop (an empty storefront at the time of shooting) as the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron in Goblet of Fire. In the films, the magical Diagon Alley is accessible to wizards and witches from London through the Leaky Cauldron, an unassuming pub wedged next to a record store.

An English parish church located halfway between the Tower of London and London Bridge, it was originally built during Norman times. Although the Great Fire caused terrible damage to the church it was faithfully rebuilt and topped with a steeple designed by Sir Christopher Wren. But in 1941, the church was devastated by the Blitz. A direct hit destroyed everything apart from the north and south walls, and Wren’s steeple. The threat of German invasion of the United Kingdom had ended with the Battle of Britain a year earlier, but the sustained strategic bombing of the UK continued. By 1941, the Blitz was reaching its terrible crescendo. Starting on September 7, 1940, London was bombed for nearly 60 consecutive nights. The night of December 29 saw the most ferocity, as the Luftwaffe blanketed London with bombs in what was called the Second Great Fire of London. By the end of the Blitz, over 1 million London homes had been destroyed, including much of the old Saxon church. After the war, with much of London in rubble, the slow rebuilding process began. But St. Dunstan-in-the-East remained in ruins. In 1967, the City of London Corporation decided to turn the bombed-out shell of the church into a public garden, which remains to this day. Hidden away on a secluded side street, and long since dwarfed by the modern steel and chrome structures of the city, it remains one of London’s secret gardens. One of the last Blitz-damaged buildings left in the United Kingdom, overgrown with trees, ivy, and wall-climbing flowers growing amongst the ruined arches, it’s a poignant living memorial to the horrors of the Blitz and a testament to the resilience of the City of London which survived it.

137,Fingal's Cave,"Isle of Staffa, Scotland",This astonishingly geometric cave has inspired everyone from Jules Verne to Pink Floyd.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fingal-s-cave,"Queen Victoria, Matthew Barney, Jules Verne, and Pink Floyd are not names you usually hear in the same sentence, but then the place that they all share is itself quite uncommon. Known as Fingal’s Cave, it bears a history and geology unlike any other cave in the world. At 72 feet tall and 270 feet deep, what makes this sea cave so visually astoundingly is the hexagonal columns of basalt, shaped in neat six-sided pillars that make up its interior walls. These fractured columns form a crude walkway just above the water level so that visitors can go far inside and explore the cave. The cave was a well-known wonder of the ancient Irish and Scottish Celtic people and was an important site in the legends. Known to the Celts as Uamh-Binn or “The Cave of Melody,” one Irish legend, in particular, explained the existence of the cave as well as that of the similar Giant’s Causeway in Ireland. As both are made of the same neat basalt columns, the legend holds that they were the end pieces of a bridge built by the Irish giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (a.k.a. Finn McCool), so he could make it to Scotland where he was to fight Benandonner, his gigantic rival. The legend, which connects the two structures, is in effect geologically correct. Both the Giant’s Causeway and Fingal’s Cave were indeed created by the same ancient lava flow, which may have at one time formed a “bridge” between the two sites. Of course, this happened some 60 million years ago, long before people would have been around to see it. Nonetheless, the deductive reasoning of the ancient peoples formed the connection and base of the legend that the two places must be related. The cave was rediscovered when naturalist Sir Joseph Banks visited it in 1772. At the time of Banks’ discovery, Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem in Six Books was a very popular poetic series, supposedly translated from an ancient Gaelic epic by Irish poet James Macpherson. The book was an influence on Goethe, Napoleon, and Banks, who promptly named the Scottish cave, which already had the name Uamh-Binn, after the Irish legend, calling it “Fingal’s Cave.” And though Banks is responsible for both rediscovering and renaming the cave, it would be a romantic German composer who truly vaulted the cave to world fame. So moved was famed composer Felix Mendelssohn by the splendor of the cave that he sent the opening phrase of an overture on a postcard to his sister with the note: “In order to make you understand how extraordinarily the Hebrides affected me, I send you the following, which came into my head there.” The Hebrides Overture, also known as Fingal’s Cave, premiered on May 14, 1832, in London. (The original name may have been based on the amazing noises the cave sometimes produces.) In a one-two Romantic punch, artist J. M. W. Turner painted “Staffa, Fingal’s Cave” in the same year and together these launched the cave from a little-known wonder into a must-see Romantic-Victorian tourist site. William Wordsworth, John Keats, Lord Tennyson, and Queen Victoria all visited the cave as did consummate traveler and lover of wonders, Jules Verne. After this, the cave never left the public imagination. Pink Floyd named one of their early, unreleased songs after the cave, and Matthew Barney used the cave in his Cremaster cycle. One can visit the cave via cruise (though boats cannot enter the cave, they make regular passes by it) or can travel to the small island of Staffa and hike into the cave by stepping from column to column. By the way, northern shores of Staffa host a puffin colony during the summer months.  To get to nearby Iona the ferry from Fionnphort connects with bus number 496 to Craignure, which connects with a Caledonian Macbrayne ferry service to Oban. Oban has a train and bus service to Glasgow. The journey from Iona to Glasgow takes approximately five hours. The bus and ferries will wait for incoming services to try to keep the connections. Boat trips from Oban, Dervaig, Tobermory, Fionnphort (all on the isle of Mull) and Iona allow visitors to view caves and the puffins that nest on the island between May and September. There are relatively few puffins that nest on Staffa, and they tend to nest on the other side of the island from Fingal's cave. The entire island is walkable via trails. There are tours available that take in Staffa as well as more puffin-heavy islands; they run mostly in June-July, which is high puffin season. There is a landing place used by tourist boats just north of Am Buachaille, but disembarkation is only possible in calm conditions. The island lacks a genuine anchorage.

138,Twinings Tea Shop,"London, England","A 300-year-old tea shop that brought tea to the English people, not to mention the Queen herself.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/twinings-tea-shop,"You’ll have to excuse the exoticized Chinamen figures atop the Twinings tea shop doorway at 216 Strand. They’ve been sitting up there for about three centuries, in which time the cultural acceptability of such caricatures has lessened, and tea is more often associated with British gentry than with Chinese merchants. As a young man Thomas Twining apprenticed under an East India Company merchant, importing goods from exotic locales, coffee and tea in particular. Twining’s mercantile career began in 1706 when he opened a small storefront on a busy London thoroughfare called the Strand. He called it Tom’s Coffee House, and it soon became a popular gathering spot for fashionable aristocrats. Despite his shop being dedicated to coffee, Twining soon garnered a reputation for having some of the finest tea blends in London. Within a decade he ceased selling coffee entirely and almost exclusively sold dry packaged teas. This allowed women to partake in tea-drinking at home as well, as coffee houses were male-only establishments. Twining expanded his business, opening up more shops, and eventually growing it into the tea empire it is today. Though we think of Britain’s relationship to tea being as old as the nation itself, the drink had only been introduced in the 1660s by a Portuguese queen. With the expansion of East Indian trade and merchants like Twining though, tea quickly became the national beverage. Today Twinings is synonymous with the history of British tea. Over 300 years later, the original Twinings shop on the Strand is still in business. The Twinings logo, a simple, gold sign bearing the company name, has remained unchanged since 1787, making it the second oldest corporate logo still in use, behind that of Stella Artois, which was first introduced in 1366. In 1837, Queen Victoria granted the company a Royal Warrant, a merit which has given Twinings the honour of providing tea to the Royal family ever since.",royalty shops food history

The Society “is devoted to exploring and furthering the esoteric, literary and artistic aspects of life in London and beyond”. The gallery shop, situated within a small group of commercial premises along an arterial road, is full of taxidermied specimens of all sizes, skeletons under glass domes, erotica, modern art, books and myriad other curios. Step inside and glimpse everything from polar bears to peacocks, quartz dildos to vintage speculums, winged animals to insect sculptures, skulls of all sizes and origins, anatomical anomalies, and even a couple of mermaids. The shop’s website describes it as “an attempt to recreate or reinterpret, within 21st century sensibilities, a 17th century Wunderkabinett”. Although in need of a good dusting, the Last Tuesday Society’s Shop of Horrors is curious, horrific and fascinating in equal measure. “It is a collection of objects assembled at a whim on the basis of their aesthetic or historical appeal,” the website explains. “There is no attempt at creating or explaining, meta-narratives or educating anyone. It is merely a display of naturalia and artificialia designed to give pleasure to the creators of the Museum, who hope that you too will enjoy it.” The shop’s manager, Vadim Kosmos, says: “Curiosity shops provide a sense of wonder. You can look anything up on the internet these days, but you can’t touch it.” The groundwork is now a dedicated bar selling the usual drinks and cocktails but specializing in absinth served in the traditional manner with fountain, spoon, and sugar   The closest tube station is Cambridge Heath, bus from Old Street.

140,Fairy Pools,"Isle of Skye, Scotland",These fantastically named natural pools look like something out of a Scottish myth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fairy-pools,"Scottish culture is chock full of naturalistic Celtic myths and legends that speak of magical beings living under hills, and waters filled with beasts large and small. The Fairy Pools near Carbost, Scotland embody that sense of magic in their unbelievably blue waters. Accessible only by a foot hike through the Glen Brittle forest, the series of small waterfalls that make up the so-called Fairy Pools are some of the most pristine swimming holes in the world. On a sunny day, the turquoise waters of the natural pools are so clear, one can readily see each moss-covered stone at the bottom. Located at the foot of the Cuillin Mountains, the crystal-clear water flows between pools with waterfalls of various shapes and sizes. On wet, cloudy days after a good rain, torrents of water rush and whirl in thunderous cascades. There does not seem to be a legend attributed to the fairy pools, but rather the pools look as though they were pulled from the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien. The waters of the Fairy Pools might be bone-chillingly cold, but their near supernatural atmosphere has made them one of Scotland’s most enduring natural wonders.  From Portree on the Isle of Skye, head North and then West towards the town of Carbost. Just before reaching the town, head South towards Glenbrittle. A small fairy pools sign can be seen at the crossroad. While driving towards Glenbrittle, the Fairy pools car park will be found on your right. Parking costs £5 per car and must be paid for by coins or card (no notes). From the parking lot, called (and signed) Glumagan Na Sithichean, cross the public road to find the path labeled ""Sligaghan,"" take the path in front of you. The return walk takes 2 hours without any places to protect from the sun, wind or rain. Several small river crossings are required (with large rocks to help) and ground can be slippery when wet.

141,Puzzlewood,"Coleford, England","The mysterious, fantastical woodland inspiration for ""The Lord of the Rings.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/puzzlewood,"Located inside the Forest of Dean near Coleford, Puzzlewood is a popular outdoor tourist destination in Gloucestershire, England. It’s filled with beautiful moss-covered rocks, bridges, and fantastic rock and tree formations that can be accessed by miles of winding pathways. Puzzlewood, used as a filming location for Merlin and Dr. Who, covers more than 14 acres and is considered one of the best examples of pre-Roman Celtic open iron mines. The paths were laid in the early 19th century by the owner at the time. It didn’t open to the public until 100 years later. An enchanting place, Puzzlewood is said to have served as the inspiration for J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. A frequent visitor to the area, Tolkien may have considered Puzzlewood and the Forest of Dean when he created the Old Forest, Mirkwood, Lothlorien, and other places in his Middle Earth. In addition to the forest, there are farm animals, outdoor picnic tables, a cafe, a gift shop, and a children’s playground in the area. Some of the animals kept in Puzzlewood include cattle, wild fowl, rabbits, donkeys, Soay sheep, goats, and Shetland ponies. The area around Puzzlewood is a working farm. Over the years, evidence of Roman occupation of the area has been found in the form of over 3,000 coins from the third century. Over the hundreds of years since the Romans left the site, the trees and moss have grown unchecked to cover any man-made structures that may have been left behind for mining.  Puzzlewood is less than a mile south of Coleford in the Forest of Dean. The simplest way to get there is to head to Coleford and follow the brown tourist signs for Puzzlewood.",intriguing environs natural wonders ecosystems nature animals
142,Fairy Glen,"Isle of Skye, Scotland",This dramatic landscape hidden on the Isle of Skye looks as though you've stepped into the magical realm.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fairy-glen,"The Fairy Glen is one of the Isle of Skye’s most enchanting attractions. The bumpy, off-the-beaten-path spot stands out from the surrounding farmland. The natural rock formations, cone-shaped hills dotted with ponds and scattered waterfalls, are all within one small area, making it seem as though it’s the shrunken version of a large-scale geological wonder. Though there’s no definitive folklore linking the land to the magical realm, some say faeries created the dramatic landscape and still dwell within its many crevices. It’s no wonder; the whimsical otherworldly landscape looks just like the kind of place you’d expect to find mythical creatures. The Isle of Skye is, after all, rich with faerie lore. However, the unique geological formations are actually the result of a landslip, similar to the one that created the nearby Quiraing. It’s easy to spend a morning or afternoon wandering among the cluster of hills. The grassy glen’s natural colors are especially vivid on a sunny day. Visitors can take their time climbing the mounds or snapping photos of the stone designs tourists tend to create (though they’re not nearly as impressive as the more permanent rock spiral). The best vantage point is from the top of Castle Ewan, the natural rock formation that resembles an ancient ruin. A steep, narrow trail leads directly to the top, but it does involve a bit of scrambling. The locals consider the stone designs created by tourists to be vandalism and spend the winter undoing them each year. Since the glens are on private property, it’s appropriate to respect the wishes of the locals on this matter and refrain from building with the rocks.  Note that there are no signs for the Fairy Glen. If you're heading North on the A87 (coming from Portree), turn right on the road right just before the Uig Hotel. It's about a five minute drive along a narrow, winding path to the glen, which is visible from the road.

143,Platform 9 3/4,"London, England",Kings Cross Station pays tribute to its role in Britain's best-selling book series.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/platform-9-3-4,"Harry Potter fans know: the best way to get to Hogwarts is aboard the Hogwarts Express, which dutifully awaits students of the prestigious wizarding school at Platform 9 3/4 at the start of each term. Reaching the platform, of course, is an adventure in itself; magical blood and nerves of steel are required in order to pass through what appears to be a solid brick barrier to where the platform is located on the other side. Details of Platform 9 3/4 were made public by the 1997 publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, the debut novel of J. K. Rowling’s phenomenally popular Harry Potter series. Kings Cross station reappeared several times throughout the series, serving as the setting for some of the most pivotal moments, and the station was later used as a shooting location in the Harry Potter films. For several years now, Kings Cross has celebrated its role in the beloved books with a marker indicating the location of Platform 9 3/4, below which a baggage trolly can be seen disappearing into the bewitched barrier. Construction on Kings Cross Station between 2005 and 2012, however, made the magical platform even more elusive than usual, shuffling the marker and accompanying trolly to various locations around the station several times, at one point relegating it to an alcove outside. In 2012 it was announced that the attraction had finally found a permanent home in the New Western Departures Concourse, nestled between Platforms 9 and 10, right where you would expect it. Important to note: for muggles, the barrier remains quite solid, and Potter fans are advised against attempting to cross it. Easily found within King's Cross Station, but allow plenty of time if you wish to wait in line to pose with the magical trolley, or visit the adjacent Harry Potter Shop, especially during the high tourist season.",monuments
144,Cecil Court,"London, England",A charming 17th-century alley is lined with secondhand bookstores and antiquarian shops.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cecil-court,"This dreamy little 17th-century lane is a book lover’s paradise. It’s lined with about 20 secondhand bookshops and antiquarian shops, all selling a trove of unique treasures. It’s no wonder the street’s nickname is “Booksellers’ Row.” Cecil Court feels like a hidden gem. Though the narrow street splinters from a highly trafficked thoroughfare, it maintains a calm, cozy atmosphere. The buildings that stand today date from the late 19th century, making a wander down the street feel like a stroll through London’s past. Pop into the Victorian shop fronts, and you’ll be greeted by shelves of (at times pricey) goods. You can find anything from first-edition books to rare children’s literature, from unique maps to esoteric goods and one-of-a-kind jewellery and art. You can also sift through boxes of prints and books outside some of the shops. Cecil Court is one of the Covent Garden neighborhood’s older passageways. As such, it’s as historical as it is aesthetically alluring. An eight-year-old Mozart stayed here for a year while he was touring Europe. A century later, the street became a hotspot for early British filmmakers; and it was the inspiration for “Diagon Alley” in the Harry Potter films.  You can stroll down the street at any time, though most of the shops don't open until around 10. Once you've explored all Cecil Court has to offer, pop over to nearby Goodwin's Court to glimpse another charming alley.",alleyways bookstores shops
145,Goodwin's Court,"London, England",An easily overlooked stretch of ornate window fronts and gaslight lamps that could be right from the pages of Dickens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goodwins-court,"London is famous as a city of side streets and alleyways and conjures up pictures of deerstalker-clad detectives appearing from the fog, pacing behind top-hat adorned gents or serial killers. Goodwin’s Court is an excellent example of just that sort of evocative image, tucked neatly away between London’s modern, bustling boulevards. An easily missed set of steps from St. Martin’s Lane leads through a low-roofed arch and around a corner to reveal what seems to be a perfectly preserved piece of London nostalgia: a spindly stretch of ornate window fronts and gaslight lamps, akin to anything found in the pages of Charles Dickens or Conan Doyle. According to the nearby plaque, the well-preserved row of shops was built in 1690, predated by a passage known as Fishers Alley. Actress and mistress to Charles II, Nell Gwynn, is thought to have been one of the earliest residents of the Court. It’s easy to imagine elaborate window displays, which were at the time gaining in popularity, decorating the elegant windows and catching the eyes of shoppers strolling by. When the shops slowly became increasingly unprofitable, the quaint alley was occupied by offices, and many theater and entertainment agents have taken spaces there at different points in time. Today, the doors are decorated with gleaming door knobs, knockers, and nameplates for the businesses contained within. The charming passageway now maintains a relatively secluded feel from the surrounding busy streets, serving as a scenic shortcut. Goodwin’s Court draws its fair share of local photographers and domestic TV stations in search of a unique city location. Whether viewed through the spectacles of Dickens or just straight out of the history books, it’s an excellent example of the architecture and historic charm that helps London continue to capture the imagination.  Goodwin's Court is easy walking distance from Trafalgar Square and the Charing Cross Tube Station.",retail alleyways cities literature shops history
146,Magic Circle Museum,"London, England",This collection of illusory paraphernalia has been culled from the history of London's premier magician's club.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/magic-circle-museum,"Established back in 1905, Britain’s Magic Circle is a secretive group of illusionists who have set out to keep the magic in magic. While the illusionists are not inclined to reveal their secrets, curious conjurors can take a peek at the mysterious collection kept in their headquarters’ museum. Opened in 1998, the clubhouse of the Magic Circle was built from the ground up as a base of operations for the century-old illusionists club. In addition to a mid-sized theater where regular shows can be put on or simply prepared for, and a library of books pertaining to the art of illusion, there is a remarkable museum of posters, artifacts, and ephemera from throughout the history of magic. Among the items on display are a number of props from guns used in bullet illusions, to pieces of Houdini’s famous act, to the cup-and-ball trick that Prince Charles used when he applied to join The Circle (he was accepted in 1975). Entrance to the Magic Circle headquarters is restricted to members of the close-knit magician’s cabal, although they do host a number of public events where mere muggles can enter the building for presentations, shows, or simply to see the museum. Anyone that does not want to wait for them to pull back the veil can apply to join the Magic Circle, although it requires two years as an apprentice, and being sponsored by at least two preexisting members just to be able to test in.

147,Mary King's Close,"Edinburgh, Scotland",17th century streets hidden under Edinburgh were once a breeding ground for the black death.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mary-kings-close,"Life in 17th-century Mary King’s Close in Edinburgh was less than sanitary. Inhabitants lived in narrow winding streets, crammed into packed tenements up to seven stories high. Without a proper sewer system, tenants simply dumped waste into the streets below. Rats ran wild in the close carrying fleas with them everywhere they went. When the fleas became infected with the bacterium Yersinia pestis, better known as the bubonic plague or “The Black Death,” it spelled disaster for the residents of Mary King’s Close. When the Black Death first appeared on the British Isles, it appeared to be a problem only in the English territories. The Scots delighted in calling it “the foul death of the English.” Soon, however, the rats, fleas, and bacteria had made their way to Scotland. The country lost a quarter of its population to the scourge. In the tight quarters of Mary King’s Close, the disease was particularly devastating. There is a persistent myth that in an effort to quarantine the victims, Edinburgh city officials sealed off Mary King’s Close in 1644, leaving some 600 inhabitants to perish inside without hope. In reality, the plague victims were well cared for, and the town council managed the outbreak efficiently and compassionately. Families healthy enough to be moved were taken to Burgh Muir. Those who weren’t able to be moved let the workers know by putting up white flags in their windows so that food and coal could be delivered to their doorsteps. The plague doctor, George Rae, then came into the town wearing leather from head to toe and a bizarre bird-shaped mask to help protect him from the disease. (It worked; the leather kept the fleas from biting Rae and he survived the outbreak.) To save a plague victim, Rae would slice off the top of the victim’s sore and jam a red-hot poker into the wound to cauterize it. While no doubt horrible, the technique did indeed save lives. After the plague had passed, tenants continued to live in Mary King’s Close up until the beginning of 20th century, when it was emptied and sealed up. The last person to leave, did so in 1902. The Royal Exchange was built on top of it and the close was forgotten. It wasn’t rediscovered until workmen digging on the street above accidentally punched down into the winding streets. The closes were used as bomb shelters during WW II. Beginning in the 1990’s, Mary King’s Close has become a popular tourist site, with guided tours by historical reenactors, and attracts those interested in its macabre history and many ghost stories. One of the most famous ghosts supposed to live here is a 10-year-old girl named Annie who died of the plague. Believers report temperature changes and feeling a strange presence in her room. Many have left toys, dolls, and sweets for her in the close. Tours are given seven days a week, all year long (excluding Christmas Day) with special events throughout the year, including a look into what Christmas would be like in the close’s prime.  Directions for how to get to the close for different types of transportation can be found on the official website. The walking tour is just over an hour, it will cover very uneven surfaces in near darkness, including several sets of stairs, steep grades, low ceilings and doorways. Wear suitable footwear. The tour is not wheelchair accessible and may not be suitable for those with limited mobility or problems with confined spaces. Children under 5 are not permitted.",subterranean sites ruins
148,The Churchill War Rooms,"London, England",The perfectly preserved underground rooms where Churchill plotted the war against Germany.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-churchill-war-rooms-london-england,"Hidden deep underneath the streets of Westminster lies what was once one of the most secretive and protected parts of London. As the German Luftwaffe pulverized Britain during the Blitz, a system of bunkers and tunnels protected the British government, as Sir Winston Churchill and his chiefs of staff, desperately plotted to secure Britain’s defense against the impending Nazi invasion. The Churchill War Rooms remain remarkably preserved. After the last V2 rocket hit London, and victory in Europe was secured, the government returned to its daily duties above ground in the Houses of Parliament and the War Rooms were simply sealed up and forgotten. They remained so until 1984 when custody was handed over to the Imperial War Museum and the bunkers were opened to the public. Today, the hidden complex looks just as it did in 1945, as though Winston Churchill had just left the room, and was about to return. Plans for some form of protective bunker where the government could operate in safety were drawn up, as far back as 1938. The Spanish Civil War had shown what horrors modern aerial bombardment could inflict. As Germany ramped up its military industrial might, the Committee of Imperial Defense began digging underneath the basement of the New Public Offices, located on the corner of Horse Guards Road and Great George Street. A complex system of bunkers, sleeping rooms, communication equipment and ventilation was burrowed underneath Westminster, and the War Rooms were completed on August 27th, 1939. Just five days later, Germany invaded Poland. The main brief of the war rooms was to provide the Cabinet with safety whilst they worked. It was also to become the nerve centre of the British war effort, as a meeting place for the Chiefs of Staff for the Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force. Today, entrance is gained by a small doorway by the Treasury building, under steps marked with a statue of Clive of India. The corridors are narrow, and dimly lit just as they were during the dark days of the Blitz. As wave after wave of German bombers firebombed London with high explosives and incendiaries, the War Rooms aimed to maintain order and calm. One of main corridors still has its weather board in place, where a card strip would indicate whether the day would be sunny, rainy, or cloudy. During air raids, the indicator was always changed to “windy” as a joke. Original plans during the 1930s had mooted the idea of having the Prime Minister and his Cabinet evacuate the City and operate from the country, but it was felt that Londoners would feel abandoned. So the Cabinet would meet daily here underground. The Cabinet Room is left as it was, with Churchill’s chair at the head of the table. The War Cabinet would meet here during air raids, a total of 115 times. But the danger was still deadly. Despite the re-enforced concrete, it is estimated that a direct hit by a bomb of anything over 500 pounds would have completely destroyed the deep lying bunker. Of equal importance as the Map Room. Here a daily intelligence report of the enemies strength’s and movements were plotted on giant maps. Manned 24 hours a day, the maps also showed the depositions of the British armed forces. Heads of all the armed divisions relied on the up-to-the minute military intelligence depicted on the maps, providing crucial information for King George VI and Winston Churchill. Depicted on the maps by strings of blue wool and pins, the German advance was steadily plotted. By 1940, the foreboding line of blue wool had reached the English Channel itself. As the Battle of Britain raged overhead, the tension within these hidden rooms must have been on a knife edge. Joan Bright, of the War Office and stationed in the War Rooms described how they had “been shut up inside the fortress of Britain. Blacked out, bombed out, conditioned to austerity.” An idea of the firestorm that fell upon London is given by daily reports of the V1 rocket attacks pinned to the wall of the map room. From June 15th, 1944, to July 20th, the intelligence staff plotted 3,955 of the feared “doodlebugs” launched. Of these, 2,955 crossed the coastline into England. One of the most important rooms in the bunkers was also its smallest. A former broom cupboard housed a telephone that was in turn connected to a vast scrambling device housed in the basement of nearby Selfridges department shop on Oxford Street. Developed in America by Bell, it was the cutting edge of communications technology. For it was in this tiny broom cupboard that Winston Churchill was able to talk directly, and safely, to Roosevelt. The scrambler, codenamed “Sigsaly” opened a vitally important direct hotline between the two leaders without the fear of being tapped by the Abwehr, the German intelligence service. A visit to the Churchill War Rooms is to step back to a time to when the future of Britain, and indeed the free world, hung desperately in the balance. Immaculately preserved by the Imperial War Museum, the underground headquarters look just as they did when the lights were finally turned off in 1945.",bunkers hidden military history world war ii military
149,221b Baker Street,"London, England","The popularity of Sherlock Holmes led to the creation of his fictional address, turning the orderly London street numbers askew.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/221b-baker-street,"Beeton’s Christmas Annual was a hugely popular Victorian literary magazine. The November 1887 issue featured a story that introduced the world to one of the most famous detectives and street addresses in fiction; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “A Study in Scarlet” marked the first appearance of consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, and his friend Dr. John Watson. Watson recounts how, “We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows.” Located near Regent’s Park in London, the Baker Street of the 1880s was largely made up of Georgian townhouses. But at the time Conan Doyle was writing, the street numbers didn’t actually run as far as number 221. Presumably, Conan Doyle didn’t want an actual home to become affected by his popular stories. But when Baker Street was extended northwards in the 1930s, it created an actual 221B. It was given to an Art Deco bank building owned by the Abbey National building society. Almost immediately the Abbey National started receiving both fan mail and genuine letters asking for help from the bohemian consulting detective. The volume of letters was so great that the Abbey National actually hired a full-time staff member to deal with all the correspondence. In 1990 the Sherlock Holmes museum opened on Baker Street, albeit a few doors down from the building society, at numbers 237-241. The museum faithfully recreated the living quarters of Holmes and Watson, even down to the exact 17 steps leading up to the sitting room. Immaculately decorated and furnished with everything from Holmes’ violin resting in a chair by the fireplace, his collection of books on beekeeping, to Dr Watson’s handwritten notes, it gives the impression that Holmes and Watson had just left 221B on a pressing case, leaving their rooms perfectly preserved. Indeed, the museum purposely went out of their way, perhaps mischievously, to give the impression that Holmes and Watson were actual people. All over London, blue circular plaques adorn the walls where famous people have resided. These are strictly limited to real people; however, the museum created a similar-looking plaque for its exterior bearing the inscription, “Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, 1881-1904.” The fiction was given further weight when an opening ceremony given by the leader of Westminster City Council in 1990 bestowed upon the museum the official address of 221B. A dispute immediately arose with the Abbey National over the famous address. For not only were there now two 221B’s on Baker Street, but the museum’s one put the street numbers out of order. The feud wasn’t settled until the Abbey National vacated their building in 2005, and the museum was given sole rights to the famous number. But still today Baker Street is the only street in London that has a house number that appears out of sequence with the rest of the street. Today the museum is a bustling tourist attraction in northwest London, with the recent BBC television series Sherlock ensuring that the famous address remains high in the public consciousness. And on the second floor there is a collection of the correspondence which still comes to number 221B Baker Street from all over the world, hoping to secure the services of Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective. Given the small space of the museum, there are often long lines waiting to get inside.",eccentric homes literature homes museums

151,Kensal Green Cemetery and Catacombs,"London, England","Winding paths and ramshackle mausoleums in the oldest ""park cemetery"" in London.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kensal-green-cemetery-and-catacombs,"Kensal Green is the one of the oldest public burial grounds and the first of the “Magnificent Seven” Victorian garden cemeteries built in the suburbs of London in the 19th century. Comprised of Kensal Green, Highgate, West Norwood, Abney Park, Nunhead, Brompton, and Tower Hamlets cemeteries, the Magnificent Seven were created beginning in 1832 as part of an effort to move burials out of the City of London in response to twin pressure of health concerns about overcrowded churchyard cemeteries as well as desires for buildable land in the quickly expanding city. Rapid population growth and a cholera outbreak in London in the 1830s hastened plans to offers an alternative to small crowded churchyards within the city, with large new cemeteries on the outskirts of town. Inspired by the model created at Père Lachaise in Paris (est. 1804), London’s garden cemeteries set out to design burial grounds with inviting landscaping, shady trees, and winding paths. The Kensal Green cemetery opened in 1833; most of the first 54 acres were consecrated by the Church of England, with a small Dissenters’ Section for other sects and religions at the western end. The cemetery now covers 72 acres (29 hectares) in northwest London, bounded by Harrow Road to the north, Ladbroke Grove to the west, the Paddington Canal to the south, and St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Cemetery to the east. The new cemeteries gained popularity in the Victorian period, with their elaborate rituals surrounding death and mourning. After the funeral of HRH The Duke of Sussex, sixth son of George III, in 1843, and that of his sister HRH Princess Sophia in 1848, Kensal Green in particular became the most fashionable burial ground in the country if not the empire, attracting literally hundreds of titled aristocrats, numerous celebrities, and the aspiring middle classes. Many of the tombstones and mausoleums of the period are enormous and lavish, with areas for visitors to loiter. The crushing death toll of WWI led to less ostentatious funerals and memorial decorations, and the growing popularity of cremation brought the heyday of the garden cemetery to an end. With their decline in popularity came an overall decline in conditions. Aerial bombardment did some damage in WWII, and by the 1960s, they were best known for their spooky overgrown and ramshackle appearance. In recent decades, volunteers have helped to clear and restore monuments and chapels at Kensal Green, which now has some 140 listed buildings and monuments. The cemetery holds some 65,000 graves, and still retains a romantic atmosphere, with mature trees and magnificent monuments along the main carriageways, overgrown paths, and tumbled tombstones in the byways. Many notable people are buried at Kensal Green, among them Charles Babbage* (of Difference Engine fame), engineers Sir Marc Isambard Brunel and Isambard Kingdom Brunel, authors William Makepeace Thackeray, John Gould, Wilkie Collins and Anthony Trollope, playwrights Terence Rattigan and Harold Pinter, merchants Andrew Pears, W.H. Smith and William Whiteley, painters William Mulready and J.W. Waterhouse, as well as Lady Wilde and Lady Byron, Winston Churchill’s daughter, and Charles Dickens’ in-laws. The catafalque and hydraulic lift in the Anglican Chapel have been restored to working order, although an appeal is now underway to restore the building itself. The Anglican Chapel (and the catacomb beneath it) and Dissenter’s Chapel can be visited on the regular Sunday afternoon tours led by the Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery. *Not all of Babbage is buried at Kensal Green. Half of his brain is preserved at the Hunterian Museum, London.

152,Alnwick Poison Garden,"Alnwick, England","The sign at the garden gate reads: ""These Plants Can Kill.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alnwick-poison-garden,"Inspired by the legendary botanical gardens in Padua, an English duchess created this garden dedicated entirely to flora which are deadly and/or narcotic. Behind big black gates, the carefully curated garden contains about 100 legendary killers like Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade), Strychnos nux-vomica (strychnine), and Conium maculatum (hemlock). Guides explain their deadly properties while keeping ne’er-do-wells and curious children away from the plants, warning them: “Do not touch any of the plants, don’t even smell them. There are plants here that can kill you.” The duchess herself is an unlikely patron. Until 1995, she was just Jane Percy, mother of four. Then in 1995, her husband unexpectedly became the twelfth Duke of Northumberland following his brother’s untimely death, and the next thing they knew they had a castle to deal with. As she inspected her newly inherited digs and expansive gardens, much of which had been meticulously designed by the famous landscape designer Capability Brown, she came across an overgrown, neglected section. Formal gardens had been planted in that spot by the first duke in 1750, and it passed through several incarnations until World War II, when it was converted from a place of Italian ornamental splendor into a victory garden of vegetables. By 1950, it had closed. She decided to restore it, not to its former glory, but into a new, modern garden. The poison garden opened in 2005 as just a portion of the ambitious 14-acre new gardens. Wanting in part to hark back to old apothecary’s gardens, the duchess shied away from planting healing medicinals and instead sought out hard-to-get deadly poisons. Also included in the gardens are narcotic plants like opium poppies, cannabis, magic mushrooms, datura, and tobacco. Many of these required special government permission to grow. Because the danger posed by poisonous plants is very real (some can kill or sicken just through touch), some plants are caged, and the garden is secured each evening behind gates under a 24-hour security watch. Other parts of the garden include an enormous multi-level treehouse and a bamboo labyrinth. You may also find the looming Alnwick Castle strangely familiar, having seen it stand in as Hogwarts in the first two Harry Potter films. The gardens are planned in several phases, some of which are still incomplete—funds in the millions of pounds have not been as forthcoming lately.  The Alnwick Garden is just off the A1 at Alnwick, and is well signposted. Buses connect Alnwick to the surrounding towns and Newcastle. Train station: Alnmouth. The Poison Garden can be visited only as part of a guided tour. The tour is free after you have paid the entry fee to the Castle gardens. Tours run every half hour up until 5 PM.",botanical tunnels poison horticulture gardens plants
153,Natural History Museum of London,"London, England",Eighty million natural history specimens call this gargantuan museum home.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/natural-history-museum,"Established in 1881, the Natural History Museum of London has an impressive 70 million specimens in its stately walls. Based on the collection of Sir Hans Sloane, the museum now includes such star wonders as Archie the Giant Squid who resides in the Darwin Centre Spirit Collection of jarred specimens (Archie can’t be in the main museum as its weight would cause it to crash through the floor), as well as a cursed amethyst and a piece of Kryptonite. Some of the specimens were even collected by Charles Darwin himself, a statue of whom sits in the main hall near a replica of a Diplodocus donated by Andrew Carnegie. The building was constructed with terracotta tiles in order to resist the soot in the air of Victorian London, with the west wing and the east wing are adorned with images of living and extinct species, respectively. However, you may note a coelacanth in the extinct animals wing, as it was of course only recently that ancient fish was revealed to still be living on our planet. In 2015 it was controversially announced that the popular diplodocus skeleton in the main hall (it can be seen in one of the photos) would be removed on the grounds that it was not a genuine skeleton. This resulted in a well supported “save Dippy” campaign, but the decision stands to give pride of place to the real skeleton of a blue whale. As such, in 2017, a blue whale skeleton was hung from the ceiling. The sea creature, which had been injured by whalers, was found beached in Ireland in 1891. The museum is also a fully functional laboratory, with more than 300 scientists working in a variety of fields related to biology & geology. Taking a behind the scenes tour or visiting the newly renovated Darwin Centre Cocoon you can see them at work. The building also contains a massive research archive, library, and operational labs.  The Queen's Gate entrance is best for visiting Dinosaurs, and the Exhibition Road entrance is best for Wildlife Photographer of the Year and Volcanoes and Earthquakes.

155,The Sherlock Holmes Museum,"London, England",This London pub hides a peculiar secret: a recreation of the rooms shared at 221b Baker Street by Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-sherlock-holmes-pub-london-england,"The Sherlock Holmes pub on Northumberland Avenue, near London’s Charing Cross Station, is much like the countless other pubs in the capital. That is until you venture upstairs where, in the dining room, is a life-size copy of the apartment shared by Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Until 1957, the Sherlock Holmes Pub was known as the Northumberland Arms. But then, its owners had the fortune of acquiring an entire exhibit dedicated to the world’s most famous detective that had been created for the 1951 Festival of Britain. Curated by the Westminster Library and sponsored by the Abbey National building society, the Holmes exhibit was as detailed as it was authentic. After the Festival closed, the whole Holmes collection was installed in the pub, which was renamed in honor of its new fictional tenants on the upper floor. The recreated study of 221b Baker Street is, according to the pub, “as it appeared on a crisp day in the years following the great detective’s return to London in 1894.” The rooms are decorated with the famous pipe, violin, and scientific equipment, while the wall is marked with a VR (for Victoria Regina) made by Holmes’ pistol shots. Plaster casts of some great bloodhound prepared by New Scotland Yard lie next to a snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the center, a gift from the King of Bohemia in connection with the Irene Adler papers. The attention to detail is remarkable, and the many screen and stage depictions of Holmes and Watson are represented with props and artwork. So lifelike is the representation of 221b Baker Street, that it feels like you’ve stepped back into Conan Doyle’s Victorian London.",bars literature shops
156,The Mail Rail,"London, England",Hidden beneath the streets of London is a secret subway that only carried mail.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mail-rail-london-england,"The Post Office Railway—commonly known as “Mail Rail”—was an automatic electric railway created to speed Royal Mail delivery in London by bypassing the city’s congested streets. In the 2000s, Royal Mail deep-sixed the system and the site became a lure for adventurers eager to survey its ruins. Early in the the 20th century, Royal Mail officials sought a way to make delivery faster. They found inspiration in Chicago’s subterranean freight train system. In 1927, after more than a decade of planning and work, the Post Office Railway opened for business. At its height, the system conveyed four million pieces of mail down a 6.5 mile underground stretch of track at speeds approaching 40 miles per hour with termini at Paddington and Whitechapel. Its stations are closer to the surface than the tunnels, which were dug at a depth of 70 feet below the surface. This allowed workers to easily bring mail to the surface and the incline allowed for gravity-powered propulsion and braking. Around the middle of the 20th century, the system reached its peak volume, shuttling 4 million pieces of mail a day. As the century wore on, however, the mail volume dwindled, and the railroad went into the red. In 2003, the railroad was closed down and abandoned and many of the entry points were sealed off.  It was long thought inaccessible, but after a group of partiers forced their way into the system others sought to find access. Since then, a few intrepid explorers, cameras in hand, have made the voyage underground. Gaining entry through mail sorting offices, explorers trekked through the tunnels and the ghost stations while trying to avoid detection by security cameras. Their images reveal an empty but intact world. Much of the rail equipment appears in working order, sitting dormant, waiting to deliver one last love letter. Since the end of July 2017, the site has now been turned into the Postal Museum complete with a 20-minute ride on specially made miniature trains (which will start operating from 4th September 2017). The Postal Museum is open every day from 10 am to 5 pm and tickets currently include entry to the Postal Museum itself, the Mail Rail exhibitions as well as their temporary exhibitions.

157,Eilean Donan,"Kyle of Lochalsh, Scotland","The most iconic structure in Scotland has been home to bishops, colonels, and Sean Connery characters.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eilean-donan,"Having been featured in photos, ads, and films, the island fortesss known as Eilean Donan has spent centuries solidifying its position as the most iconic image of Scotland for natives and foreigners alike. Built on an island a mile away from the Village of Dornie, the land was first occupied in 634 AD, home to the monastic cell of Bishop Donan. During the 13th-century Alexander II built the first incarnation of Eilean Donan to defend the surrounding mountains of Kintail and the Isle of Skye against the Viking hordes. This original castle is said to have an immense curtained wall connecting seven towers and spanning the entire island. Come 1719, a lesser-known Jacobite uprising partially destroyed the structure, and for the following 200 years, it lay in near ruins. Finally, in 1911, Colonel John MacRae-Gilstrap arrived. He bought the island and restored the castle, reopening it in 1932. Jutting artfully from its island perch at the intersection of three lochs, the castle has been featured in a number of ad campaigns, television, and films, such as; The New Avengers (1976), Highlander (1986), and Entrapment (1999). As of 2021, the Internet Movie Database (IMBD lists 21 entries in which it was used as a location, beginning with “Bonnie Prince Charlie” starring David Niven in 1948. Today, what is deemed the fourth incarnation of the castle (the history of the second and third structures remains unknown) is still owned by the MacRae family, who run a tourist center and restaurant for those who care to venture into the Feudal folds of Scotland’s history.

158,Crossbones Graveyard,"London, England","This South London cemetery holds the remains of more than 15,000 people.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crossbones-graveyard-london-england,"Cross Bones Graveyard in south London became known as the “single-woman’s” cemetery because of the high concentration of sex workers, dubbed “single-women” or “Winchester Geese.” Since these women were prevented from receiving Christian burials, Cross Bones became the unofficial resting place for them and other poor people living in squalor in the suburbs of London. Closed in 1853, it was estimated that 15,000 people were buried in the cemetery, the majority sex workers. A modern excavation done in the 1990s revealed that the area was heaped with bodies, some basically piled in mass graves. Even more grisly, the excavation led to the discovery that more than 40 percent of the graves were fetuses, or infants under the age of one. Researchers also discovered that bodies in the cemetery had come into contact with a number of diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, and Paget’s disease. Today, the horrors of the cemetery are recognized and remembered each Halloween and the site now houses an unofficial memorial garden, although most of it remains under concrete. The red fence outside it is densely decorated with tributes in the form of flowers and ribbons and the names of those buried and left to be forgotten.

159,Garden of Cosmic Speculation,"Holywood, Scotland",A 30-acre garden inspired by the principles of modern physics.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/garden-of-cosmic-speculation,"Snail-shaped grass mounds, twisting DNA helix sculptures, and undulating waves of rhododendrons make up the Garden of Cosmic Speculation, a 30-acre garden whose design is guided by the fundamentals of modern physics. The garden was designed by architecture theorist Charles Jencks and his late wife, Maggie Keswick, an expert on Chinese gardens. Located at their private residence, Portrack House, near Dumfries, Scotland, the design, according to Jencks, brings out the basic elements that underlie the cosmos. From 1989 until Keswick’s death in 1995, Jencks and his wife met with horticulturists and scientists in order to design a landscape that would bridge the worlds of art, nature and science. Perhaps viewed as an unconventional approach to landscaping, the garden features a dizzying display of geometric fractals that all illuminate—or at least are inspired by—concepts of black holes, string theory, and the “Big Bang.” The garden features five major areas connected by a number of artificial lakes, bridges, and other architectural works, including large white staircases and terraces that zigzag down a green hillside, representing the story of the creation of the universe. Jencks continued work on the garden through 2007. Today, it is open to the public one day a year through the Scotland’s Gardens Scheme and helps to raise money for Maggie’s Centres, a cancer care foundation named after Jenck’s late wife. Update as of March 2020: The garden is currently closed until 2021.  Holywood 1½ miles off A76, five miles north of Dumfries.

160,The King's Cross Ice Well,"London, England",A subterranean ice warehouse that has lain hidden beneath central London for over a century is now open to the public.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-king-s-cross-ice-well-london-england,"In Victorian Britain, fresh ice was a rare commodity. It was used largely for the refrigeration of meat and dairy products, as well as in place of anaesthetic for many surgical procedures. Ice also became something of a decadent luxury amongst those who could afford it; drinks served with ice cubes stood as a testament to wealth and distinction. The two Victorian ice wells located behind King’s Cross Station in central London were constructed by the Italian-Swiss immigrant, Carlo Gatti. Arriving in London in 1847, Gatti was an entrepreneur who became famous as an ice cream manufacturer, importing his frozen ingredients from Norway by way of ship and canal boat. At the time, most ice was harvested from frozen ponds and rivers and had to stored in underground vaults to slow the thawing process. Gatti’s ice warehouse in London consisted of two conjoined wells, each with a depth of forty-two feet and measuring a diameter of thirty feet, which between them were able to store many tons of natural ice. From here Gatti formed something of an empire, supplying ice to clients far and wide across London. By the time he died in 1878, Carlo Gatti was a millionaire. The King’s Cross ice wells were in use until 1904. By this point however, artificial ice production was becoming more common, and Gatti’s legacy was rendered obsolete. The cellars were covered and forgotten for many years while the ice warehouse itself was converted into a horse and cart depot. More recently, the building has been developed into the London Canal Museum. The ice wells beneath have been emptied, cleaned and lit, and can be viewed from a special observation platform. Additionally, once a year the museum invites visitors to descend into the ice wells to experience the history of the site up close. Just in case you can’t make it to London for a visit however, the museum has also installed a web-controlled camera inside the cellar, allowing users to tour these Victorian ice wells using their web browser.

161,Holyrood Abbey Ruins,"Edinburgh, Scotland","Ruined 11th century abbey built by King David I in Edinburgh, Scotland.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/holyrood-abbey-ruins,"Since it was completed in the early 13th century, the Holyrood Abbey Church has acted as a fulcrum for major events in Scottish and English history. Tracing the history of the church tells the story of Scotland’s relationship with its neighbors to the south, and its ruined state neatly summarizes the results of English colonization in the British Isles. The abbey’s name refers to King David’s experience with a charging deer and the shining holy cross that appeared in the forest to save his life. Rood is an Old English name for a crucifix. Founded by the king in the 12th century, the church was a grand structure with huge sweeping towers and a massive nave. Since it was near Edinburgh Castle, kings regularly stayed at the abbey and worshipped in the church, but its period of regular use was slowly coming to an end. In 1544, recurring war and invasion from England began to take a toll on the church as structural damage occurred during the War of Rough Wooing. Only ten years later, parts of the church were deemed unnecessary and were also removed. Although the Abbey was remodeled in 1633, its improvement did not last long. During the glorious revolution, English forces once again struck a deadly blow as a mob looted the church and destroyed the roof in 1688. At this point, Holyrood had nearly taken on the form it has now. An attempt to replace the roof was shoddily made in 1768 and the new roof fell in on itself within a decade. Today, the Abbey Church stands as it has for the last 250 years as ruins next to the palace in the middle of Scotland’s capital city, Edinburgh. The ruins of the Abbey Chapel are said to have inspired Felix Mendelssohn to write his “Scottish Symphony” after a visit in July 1829. Queen Victoria and her uncle King Edward IV have been sited as using these dilapidated ruins as a model for their artistic endeavors.  Included in the price of admission to Holyrood Palace.

162,The Witches' Well,"Edinburgh, Scotland",The fountain marks the area where hundreds of accused witches were burned at the stake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-witches-well-edinburgh-scotland,"Edinburgh Castle is a hotbed of tourist activity. More than a million people mill about its esplanade each year while they push through the throngs of visitors edging toward the castle gates. Many are unaware they’re walking atop the same ground that once saw the terrible death of hundreds of accused witches. Being accused of witchcraft the guilty parties were denied a proper burial and thus their remains were left where they perished. The Witches’ Well, a cast iron fountain and plaque, honors the Scottish people who were burned at the stake between the 15th and 18th centuries. It’s an easy site to miss for people only focusing on the castle that looms ahead. During the 16th century, more women were murdered at this site than anywhere else in Scotland. Each victim was denied a proper trial. Scotland’s King James VI believed witchcraft was a form of Satanism and that anyone who possessed those abilities was tainted by the devil. As a result, in the 17th and 18th centuries, more than 4,000 alleged witches (mostly female) were put to death. By the end of the 17th century, witches were routinely hanged instead of being burned. The last hanging took place in 1728. During the satanic panic of the time, anyone could be accused of using black magic. Those killed were often mere herbalists, the mentally ill, or those on the wrong end of someone else’s ill will. Suspected women were frequently bound by the hands and feet, then thrown into a lake to determine their innocence. Those who drowned were cleared, and those who had the audacity to survive were accused of witchcraft and sent to the stake. In 1894, Sir Patrick Geddes, a philanthropist known for his innovative thinking in urban planning and sociology, commissioned his friend John Duncan to design this drinking fountain for the west side of Castlehill Reservoir next to Ramsay Garden. Duncan was a famed artist who was influenced by Celtic myth and legend, which is evident in the sculpture. The small plaque, which features a bronze relief of witches’ heads entangled by a snake, uses dualism to highlight the balance between good and evil and to show that every story has two sides. The relief contains the image of a Foxglove plant, from the center of which is a coiled snake intertwined around the head of Aesculapius, the god of medicine, and his daughter Hygeia, the goddess of health. The Foxglove plant, though used medicinally, can also be poisonous depending on dosage, and the image of the serpent imbued with wisdom is also acknowledged as evil. A hole beneath the snake’s head once spouted water, though it’s dry now. The upper left corner contains Roman Numerals equivalent to 1479, and 1722 is depicted in the bottom right (the period of the most prevalent persecution of witches in Scotland.) The bottom left displays the year of the sculpture’s completion and the sculptor’s initials: 18 (JD) 94. Two bolts on the upper corners differ in design, and are Wiccan symbols of air and water. The trough is sculpted on three sides. The font displays flora with roots beneath the earth and branches above. The left panel depicts the Evil Eye with frowning eyes and a nose. The right side depicts a pair of hands holding a bowl, meant to represent healing hands. A plaque above the well was erected in 1912.  The Witches' Well is on the wall of the Tartan Weaving Mill and Experience that faces the castle esplanade. It is very easy to miss. While heading toward the castle, as you pass the Tartan Weaving Mill, look directly to your right and you'll see it.",witches magic death monuments history

Operating for over 150 years, it is Edinburgh’s oldest purpose built attraction. Established in 1835, the building was originally called “Short’s Observatory, Museum of Science and Art” until 1892 when it was purchased by Patrick Geddes and renamed “Outlook Tower”. Committed to the idea that exhibition is the most exhilarating form of education, Geddes eventually incorporated Maria Short’s Camera Obscura, and “Camera Obscura and the World of Illusions” was born. Part of the purpose of the activity center is to provide a better understanding of Edinburgh, and what better way to showcase the city than to enjoy it through telescopes, view cams, and of course, the 360° panoramic view provided by the Camera Obscura on the rooftop terrace. The rest of the building is filled with optical illusions, puzzles, mirror mazes, and a vortex tunnel, providing guests with dizzying alternate realities and tricks on the mind and on the eyes. Visitors are encouraged to get involved with everything, play with it all, and unlike a lot of learning centers, there is nothing in this one you are not allowed to touch.

However in England persecution of “witches” lasted well into the 1950s , at least in the form of attacks on the Museum of Witchcraft. As a young man Cecil Williamson stayed with his uncle, the vicar of North Bovey, in Devon. It was there he met a woman accused of witchcraft and, after intervening to stop local teens from harassing her, the he and the “witch” became friends. Williamson later is said to have been the “occult advisor” to the British secret service during the war. Cecil went on to start the Museum of Witchcraft with his friend and occultist Gerald Gardner, but during its early years the museum faced some harsh persecution as well as problems from within. Eventually, Gardner and Williamson had a falling out, resulting in the museum being split into two entities. Williamson’s new Museum of Witchcraft was forced to move three times due to vandalism and pressure from the locals in the towns. In Bourton-on-the-Water dead cats were strung up outside the museum and the museum was set on fire, a kind of modern day witch burning. Finally, Williamson settled the museum in the picturesque fishing port of Boscastle where it remains today. Williamson died in 1999 leaving the museum in the hands of Graham King, who organized a burial for the skeleton of accused witch Joan Wytte, which was in the museum’s collection and had been on display for many years. Today the museum has a very large collection of occult- and witch-related history and artifacts and among the exhibits are “Images of Witchcraft,” “Devil Worship and Satanism,” “The Hare and Shape Shifting,” and appropriately an exhibition on the “Persecution of Witches.” In 2014, the museum came under the auspices of the Museum of British Folklore who added “Magic” to the museum’s title to better encapsulate the breadth of their interests, which include exhibits on “Crowleyian,” “Gardnerian,” and “Alexandrian,” practices alongside the traditional witchcraft displays.

This tourist attraction is by no means hidden, but its sidelong devotion to history amidst the animatronics, fake smoke, and theatre blood make it unique among its kitschy brethren. Part of a small European chain of attractions that are each tailored to the local history of their city, the London Dungeon features dramatic and shocking recreations of such real life horrors as a mad King Henry VIII, Guy Fawkes’ bombing plot, and of course a fully explorable series of Whitechapel alleys stalked by Jack the Ripper. The London Dungeon was opened in 1974 by Annabel Geddes. Originally, it comprised a wax exhibition of gory and macabre local history. Over the following decades, it grew to feature walkthrough theatrical shows. In the 90s, the Dungeon was rebranded, with a shift towards interactive horror, and away from historical accuracy. Covering London’s instances of plague, torture, and murder, the attraction is clearly more invested in scares than facts.

167,Stonehenge,"Wiltshire, England",Famously misunderstood wonder of the ancient world,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stonehenge,"Much can and has been said about this amazing monument. In fact, many theories diverge dramatically, regarding the purpose and span of time during its construction. There is a lot of information that most theories agree on. Radiocarbon dating of soil and bone tools found in the appropriate strata date construction of Stonehenge to somewhere in the 3000-2000 BCE range, which maps to the Neolithic age. The stones are also not native to the immediate area, instead are from 240 miles away in Wales. The orientation of many of the remaining stones seems to coincide with a solar calendar. What this tells us is that stone age technology was used to transport these huge stones the 240 miles, to shape the stones to fit together using carpentry methods, to dig the holes for the stones to sit in as well as the earthwork ditch/bank for the henge, to move the standing stones into place, and to raise the lintel stones into place on top of the standing stones. Here are a few small goodies that will make your visit a bit richer: The biggest misconceptions about Stonehenge is not that what you might think. 1) The term “henge” refers to a circular earthwork where the bank has an internal ditch. The term has nothing to do with the stone structures. There are dozens of other henges scattered across the south of England, with or without standing stones. 2) Stonehenge is actually not a proper henge, as are found all over the south of England. The technically proper placement of bank and ditch is reversed at Stonehenge. 3) Stonehenge was built by pre-Celtic peoples, so the Druids had nothing to do with creating the monument (for the record, the modern Druidic religion is a modern reinvention). 4) Mortise and tenon joint elements show up on the wrong parts of some extant standing and/or lintel stones, implying that we are today able to see mistakes made during the original construction some 4000-5000 years ago. The monument and surrounding area is breathtaking. Spend some time in the region north of Stonehenge, exploring the Cursus, Cursus Mounds, and Woodhenge.  The best and simplest way for travelers to visit Stonehenge is to go to the Stonehenge Visitor Center, which has a huge free car park, ample services, an exhibition (museum), a model village, and shuttle buses out to the site and back.  If you care to walk it, you can do that, too. Many tour operators offer all manner of coach tours to the site. The cheapest way to visit is to drive towards the henge (with it on your right) and park up on the dirt road just after you go past. From here you can walk almost as close as people who have paid the site entry fee, saving yourself some money.

Designed by French sculptor Pierre Vivant in 1998, the eight-metre-tall stoplight was originally installed on the site of a plane tree that suffered and died from air pollution. Its changing patterns are meant to reflect the “never-ending rhythm of the surrounding domestic, financial and commercial activities.” The initial idea was to make the London Stock Exchange’s activities trigger the lights, but it was scrapped as it cost too much to put into practice. The tall “Traffic Light Tree” changes its 75 sets of lights in a random order, much to the confusion of unprepared drivers. Indeed, when Saga Motor Insurance surveyed British motorists on the best and worst roundabouts in the country in 2005, the one containing the “Tree” naturally came up high on the ranking.  The light can be seen at Billingsgate Market, at Trafalgar Way. From the Underground, take the Jubilee line to Canary Wharf, less than a 20 minute walk. When you get outside, turn right to walk up the stairs to the street. Turn right and keep walking down the same street as it curves around and goes over some water. The tree will be at the end in the middle of a roundabout across from the market. Using the term 'Traffic Light Tree' on Google Maps will help direct you to the location, as Canary Wharf and The Docklands can be a difficult place to navigate.",traffic lights electrical oddities outsider art monuments statues
169,Witley Wonder Underwater Ballroom,"Godalming, England","The hidden ""ballroom"" under a mansion lake was built by a criminal who ate a cyanide pill during his trial.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/witley-wonder-underwater-ballroom,"Called an “Underwater Ballroom,” in reality it was a subterranean smoking room built beneath a roof aquarium. Either way, it was spectacular, and like everything else on Whitaker Wright’s Lea Park estate, it was doomed. The main house on the estate was a 32-room mansion, and Wright had three artificial lakes constructed, the 9,000+ acres lavishly landscaped and reeking of wealth and means. Perhaps the most famous addition to the palatial properties was the underground conservatory/smoking room with aquarium windows, an epic statue seemingly rising out of the manufactured lake on the underwater dome that gave the glorious below-ground room a ballroom-like appearance. Whitaker Wright wore many hats throughout the years, but when he finally settled into something, it was something big - big and illegal. London and Globe Company floated stock and bonds in the realm of the mining industry, and at first Whitaker’s business dealings were simply misleading, not particularly criminal. The line was crossed into outright swindling when, after floating a large, unwieldy bond issue for the Waterloo Railway (an expensive endeavor quite out of his usual comfort zone) everything went south, straining his finances. To keep investors from seeing him struggle, he began to issue himself a series of loans and shuttle them between his companies. Unable to keep things afloat, in 1900 he fled, leaving his floundering investors in a panic, and single-handedly terrorizing London’s exchange. Now considered a scourge and a scoundrel, Wright was retrieved and forced to stand trial. Needless to say, it didn’t go well. Convicted of fraud, he was sentenced to seven years in prison by the Royal Courts of Justice in 1904. In a court anteroom, Whitaker Wright took his own life by swallowing a cyanide pill immediately after sentencing, and was found dead on the floor with a revolver in his pocket—assumed to serve as a backup in case the cyanide failed to finish the job. Wright did not face public disapproval alone—his estate actually attracted the ire of fellow countrymen as well, with its extensive acreage and resource-sucking extravagance. Once he died, the estate was auctioned off, much of it purchased by Irish shipbuilder and businessman William Pirrie (of Titanic fame), who changed its name to Witley Park and extended the property to include a deer park. In 1952, the mansion was destroyed in a fire. While new houses have been built, the landscaped park and the now ancient-looking ballroom remain.  Witley Park is a private property, and while permission is occasionally granted to view the ballroom, it isn't open to the public.

170,The Old Curiosity Shop,"London, England",The quaint little store that is said to have inspired a famous Dickens novel was only given its name after the book was released.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-old-curiosity-shop-london-england,"Tucked away among the buildings of London’s School for Economics is a small, wood-beamed shop. Dating from the 16th century, its sloping roof, overhanging second floor, and uneven Tudor gabling mark it as one of London’s oldest shops. Dwarfed and out of place amidst one of the world’s most prestigious universities, the little creaking shop, constructed from salvaged ship wood, survived not only the Great Fire of London in 1666, but the devastation of the Blitz. Living in neighboring Bloomsbury, Charles Dickens visited the quaint shop on a number of occasions. Although the name was added after the novel was released, it is thought to have become the inspiration for his 1841 novel, The Old Curiosity Shop. The Old Curiosity Shop of Dickens’s imagination was the home of a virtuous teenage orphan, Nell Trent, and her grandfather. The tragic tale took place in “one of those receptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd corners of this town and to hide their musty treasures from the public eye in jealousy and distrust.” The story was originally serialized in 1840, in his weekly periodical, Master Humphrey’s Clock, along with Barnaby Rudge. The Old Curiosity Shop was so popular, legend has it that readers in New York, desperate to find out the conclusion, stormed the wharf of Lower Manhattan when the ship bearing the last installment docked. Oscar Wilde, however, was less enthused: “One would have to have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell without dissolving into tears…of laughter.” The original shop itself started as a dairy, given as a present by King Charles II to one of his many mistresses. In the early 1970s, it was a bookstore specializing in Charles Dickens’s books. Hidden away on Portsmouth Street just south of Lincoln’s Inn Fields, the Old Curiosity Shop today is a retailer of high-end shoes and is still open for business, as it has been for over 500 hundred years.",literature shops

The cast iron tunnel is 1,215 feet long and covered with around 200,000 white tiles. It was created as a way for workers who lived in south London to get to work at the docks on the Isle of Dogs, replacing a ferry service, although now it offers 24 hour access to any travelers who need to cross the London river. During World War II, the northern end of the tunnel was damaged in the London bombing, and there you can see it reinforced with a concrete lining and thick steel. To enter the tunnel, look for the glazed dome buildings for access into the underground passageway. Renovation work to install new lifts and improve drainage started in 2009 and was completed in 2014 after delay. Access to the tunnel is by stairs or lifts.  Although a foot tunnel, Greenwich council is trialling the use of a “shared” cycling and pedestrian use at less busy times.

172,Word on the Water,"London, England",This 1920s Dutch barge is now a floating bookstore.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/word-on-the-water-the-london-bookbarge,"A most unusual barge floats on Regents Canal, which flows amid the office-littered landscape of King’s Cross. Step aboard the vessel, and you’ll find a trove of literary treasures waiting to be discovered. Word on the Water, a 1920s Dutch barge, houses an assortment of cult, classic and contemporary fiction and nonfiction books, as well as a large array of children’s books. Its items fill the space both inside and outside the barge, so even those a bit wary of stepping off solid ground can still peruse parts of its collection. The shop, which the brainchild of Paddy Screech, Jonathan Privett and Stephane Chaudat, has been open for nearly a decade. But it wasn’t always so easy to find. Previously, canal regulations meant the barge had to change location every couple of weeks, popping up wherever its owners could get a spot. After breaking the rules and squatting in one location for six months, the canal trust finally relented and gave the bookshop boat a permanent berth—thanks largely to public outcry and a successful campaign led by the shop’s many supporters. In its spot along Regents Canal, the barge has become much more than a bookstore. In the winter, its woodburning stove is lit, offering bookworms of all ages a cozy refuge from the dreary cold. In the summer, the barge hosts a variety of performances, bringing anything from folk groups to jazz bands to poetry slams to its rooftop garden. Word on the Water is a beloved feature of Granary Square, an area developed out of the old King’s Cross train sheds. The particular stretch of Regent’s Canal the barge sits on is home to a small portion of London’s large boating community, some irascible geese and swans, as well as a fine scattering of moorhens.  The nearest station is King's Cross St Pancras, then follow signs to the Regent's canal. The book barge is open daily from noon to 7:00 p.m., regardless of weather.

173,Seven Noses of Soho,"London, England",Several plaster noses are hidden in plain sight around London's Soho neighborhood.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seven-noses-of-soho,"There’s a perfectly good explanation for why several plaster noses appear randomly around London’s Soho neighborhood. However, the urban legends that have bubbled up around the mysterious sculptures may be even better. In 1997, with the proliferation of CCTV cameras spawning a controversy in the United Kingdom in general and London in particular, artist Rick Buckley undertook a project to critique the spread of “Big Brother” society. Inspired by the Situationists—a midcentury artists’ group with a flair for avant-garde performative works—Buckley made 35 plaster of Paris casts of his own nose and affixed them to buildings scattered around London. Targeting well-trafficked areas and important public buildings like the National Gallery and Tate Britain, Buckley installed his guerrilla artworks right “under the nose” of the burgeoning surveillance state. He painted the noses to match the walls they were affixed to and did not publicize his project whatsoever, curious to see if he could execute his plan without being detected and hoping that the unnoticed noses would simply become part of the structures themselves. Most of the noses were discovered fairly quickly and removed, but for those few that remained, he accomplished his goal—with some unintended consequences. Buckley didn’t publicly claim responsibility for the noses until 2011, allowing 14 years for the new architectural details to generate origin stories ranging from the misguidedly speculative to the endearingly fantastic. What is perhaps the best-known legend refers to the Seven Noses of Soho, and states that if you manage to find all seven of the mysterious noses hidden around London’s historic entertainment district, you will become fabulously wealthy (sources provide confirmation of only five noses in Soho and one of them is not a Buckley nose, so the prize still awaits intrepid treasure hunters). Another myth took the noses to be original and claimed that London architects used to be in the practice of including casts of their noses on their finished buildings. A number of legends revolve around one nose in particular: the one stuck to the Admiralty Arch that leads from the Mall to Trafalgar Square (often included among the Soho noses, though it is technically not in Soho). One story stated that it was put there to mock Napoleon, fixed at a height that allowed cavalry troops to tweak it as they passed under the arch. Another held that the nose is a nod to the Duke of Wellington, who was famous (among other, more world-historical accomplishments) for possessing a very large schnoz. The most amusing myth is that the nose is a potential spare for the memorial statue of Admiral Lord Nelson that stands atop a column in Trafalgar Square. Apparently, there was concern that the uppermost extremity of Nelson’s likeness would be damaged when the statue was lifted to the top of the high column, so a spare was stashed on the arch. Not bad histories for a nose that didn’t exist until 1997. If you’re interested in this particular anatomical tour of London, a quick Google search and this map should get you started on the known, confirmed nose locations. There are also an unknown number of ears hidden on various buildings around Covent Garden. The ears are thought to be installed by another sculptor, only this time for no apparent reason.  The coordinates provide the location of the Admiralty Arch nose. You can find the general location of most of the noses mapped on Google Maps and Foursquare.",noses protest hidden art
174,Growing Underground,"London, England",The world's first underground farm is in a Word War II bomb shelter beneath the streets of London.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/growing-underground,"An urban farm lies far below the surface of London, out of reach from any fresh air and sunlight. Growing Underground uses innovative LED lights to grow produce such as coriander, broccoli, fennel, and other micro herbs in an effort to promote zero-carbon food. The farm’s bounty goes on to fill the plates and shelves of high-end London restaurants and big-name stores such as Marks & Spencer. To make up for the lack of natural light, the plants are grown beneath LED lights that bathe the bunker in an eerie pink glow. The lights shine the brightest at night, when electricity is the cheapest. The produce is grown with hydroponics, meaning the seeds rely on a cocktail of mineral nutrients and a water solvent rather than soil. Before Growing Underground moved into the space, the shelter had been abandoned for 70 years. It’s one of eight deep-level bomb shelters built around London during World War II, that at Clapham North was constructed between November 1940 and 1942. At one point the large shelter housed 8,000 troops in a labyrinth of stairwells and tunnels that stretched for more than two miles over 100 feet underground. The Clapham North tube station opened more than four decades before the shelter was built beneath it. An extension of the City & South London Railway to Clapham Common one stop to the south, the Clapham North station is one of only two remaining in the city that has an island platform in the station tunnel. All eight of the deep-level air raid shelters feature a pair of parallel tunnels 16 feet and six inches in diameter and 1,200 feet long. Ten tunnels were planned to house a total of 80,000 troops, but only eight were constructed. The company now offers tours to the public, allowing visitors to tour the eerie pink farm of the future deep below the buzzing city streets and take home micro herb salad harvested straight from the farm.

176,Temple of Mithras,"London, England",Rebuilt remains of a temple to Roman god Mithras.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-of-mithras,"Conspiracy theorists the world over look at major financial centers for signs of secret societies. Long before IIluminati, Masons, or even Templars had instituted their secret handshakes and hidden brotherhood, ancient Rome had its own secret societies. Mere blocks from the financial epicenter of the London Stock Exchange in the center of the city of London lies the reconstructed remains of a Roman temple to the god Mithras, whose mystery cult was known to exist all over the empire. As would be expected of a secret society that came to power almost two thousand years ago, not much is known of the secret cult surrounding Mithras. Even in antiquity the rites were kept shrouded in secrecy, and male-only membership was proven with secret passwords and handshakes. Mithras is similar in name to Mithra, a Zorastrain angelic being, and Romans associated Mithras with Persia, and hence Zorastrianism. However, modern scholarship refutes the direct link to Zorastrianism. The Roman deity, Mithras, was worshiped as the god of the sun. The temple remains are Roman in origin and contain other artifacts relating to Roman deities including Minerva, Mercury, and Bacchus. What we do know is that Mithras was a hero figure in a battle between good and evil, and that he is often depicted in a cave slaying a bull. He was popular with the military and political elite, so garrisons all over the Roman world were known to have temples dedicated to Mithras, called Mithraeum. The Mithraeum in Londinium was built in the late second century, but seems to have fallen out of use by the early fourth century when the temple was filled with religious statues and apparently sealed. One probable reason for this was Emperor Constantine’s conversion to Christianity, in 312 CE, following which Christianity was made the state religion of the Roman Empire and Mithraism was outlawed. This temple was easily ignored; as was common with Mithraeum, it was built 18 feet below street level to create a symbolic cave emulating the one where Mithras slew the bull. The location of this temple to Mithras is hardly surprising, as the City of London is roughly in the same location as the Roman settlement in Londinium, on the banks of the Walbrook -  a long lost tributary of the Thames. A statue of Mithras slaying the Astral Bull was found as early as 1889, but the temple was not finally unearthed until 1954 during the construction of a modern office development, Bucklersbury House. Subsequent development in London’s financial district lead to the Mithraeum being disassembled and rebuilt on Queen Victoria Street, where it could be seen by all at slightly above street level. In 2009 the Temple was removed, with the intention of relocating it in the new Walbrook Square development on the site of the soon to be demolished Bucklersbury House. Long legal wrangles have prevented this, but the Temple has recently been reassembled near the site it originally occupied.  Take the Underground to Bank Station.

A few facts can be confirmed about the Knights. A group of pilgrims traveled to Jerusalem in 1119, and some of them were armed and followed a strict, religiously inspired code. Here’s where the facts get muddy. According to the story, nine among them took vows to become monks and were trapped in the Temple of Solomon. Or so the story goes… Named Knights Templar because of the Temple of Solomon (“templar” meaning of the temple) their group quickly blossomed as more pilgrims began traveling to Jerusalem from Europe. Muslim–Christian tensions in Jerusalem rose, and it became very expensive to protect the Christian pilgrims. Funds were raised from Europe as the Knights grew in number and prestige. Back in London, the Knights began to influence politics. With wealthy friends and their Church in central London, the Templars became intertwined in the financial and domestic concerns of the burgeoning English nation. The Master of the Church was an ex officio member of Parliament: separation of Church and State was more than five hundred years away. With a distinct round nave, the Temple Church was consecrated in 1185. The round church is modeled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. (In a twist of fate, that church may originally have been a temple to Aphrodite in the second century.) But by the late 1200s, the Crusades weren’t going so well, and, with other troubles in France, the clout of the Knights waned. When they eventually fell in 1307, their land was seized by the Crown. King Edward II used the land and buildings for law colleges that developed into the present-day Inns of Court. During World War II, German firebombs damaged the roof of the Temple Church, but it has since been restored.

Comprised of Kensal Green, Highgate, West Norwood, Abney Park, Nunhead, Brompton and Tower Hamlets cemeteries, the Magnificent Seven were created in 1832 as part of an effort to move burials out of the City of London in response to the twin pressure of health concerns about overcrowded churchyard cemeteries and desires for buildable land in the rapidly expanding city. Damaged during bombing in WWII and suffering from the general neglect and decline of most of London’s great cemeteries, by mid-20th century Nunhead was considerably overgrown with many monuments in poor repair or damaged completely.

A tentpole of the rugged vistas that characterize the Isle of Skye, this point of interest in the Scottish Highlands is a site of folkloric mysticism and natural grandeur. Situated atop Trotternish Ridge—a peninsula in the northeastern region of the Isle of Skye, created as the result of a colossal landslip—the Old Man of Storr is a 160-foot pinnacle rock formation named after its likeness to, well, an old man. The Storr, which refers to the group of looming outcrops that include and surround the Old Man, is a title derived from the Norse word for “Great Man.” Legend has it that the Old Man of Storr was a giant who resided on the Trotternish Ridge. When he was laid to rest upon his death, his thumb—the “Old Man”—remained partially above ground. The Old Man of Storr towers over the Sound of Rasaay at an elevation of more than 2,300 feet, and a hike up the grassy mounds toward the group of curious pinnacle rocks that surround the Old Man provides magnificent, panoramic views of the water and the surrounding mainland.

The name “the Devil’s Pulpit” originally referred to the mushroom-shaped rock that sometimes pokes above the rushing stream. Some say the rock is where the Devil stood to address his followers, the crimson current swirling at his feet. Others say Druids held secret meetings there, hidden from sight within the shadows of the gorge’s looming walls. Still more tell tales of witches using the rock as an execution block. However, over time, many people began referring to all of Finnich Gorge as “the Devil’s Pulpit.” It’s still a fitting name, as the red water certainly gives the whole place an eerie, almost sinister aura, though its color actually isn’t the work of the Devil at all. It’s merely a result of the underlying red sandstone. But this doesn’t make the gorge feel any less otherwordly. Climbing down the slippery steps—of course referred to at the Devil’s Steps—and entering this realm of verdant moss-covered rocks and ruby-toned water reveals an enchanting world, where thin beams of sunlight shine spotlights the gurgling stream.

The hand-carved caves were opened as of 2003 as a tourist attraction so any aspiring historic detectives are welcome to explore the caves and decide for themselves. Update as of May 2022: The site is closed indefinitely.  Gilmerton is in southern Edinburgh. Grab a bus from Princes Street or North Bridge- the 3 or the 29 (heading to Mayfield and Gilmerton respectively).

186,Kyoto Garden,"London, England",A little slice of Japan and its aesthetics in London's Holland Park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyoto-garden-holland-park,"Among the many lovely features of west London’s Holland Park is a beautiful Japanese garden gifted to the British capital by the city of Kyoto in 1991 to commemorate the longstanding friendship between England and Japan. The garden was designed by renowned Japanese landscape architects, who created a stunning green space marked by a large and beautiful pond fed by a tiered waterfall. The pond is surrounded by stone lanterns and lush plants native to Japan. A small bridge crosses over the water, while shoals of colorful koi carp swim below. Lurking around the vegetation in search of insects is a beautiful flock of (fairly tame) peacocks. The garden’s Japanese maple trees are particularly visually striking during the autumn months, when their leaves turn a rich golden red color casting the garden in crimson hues. And in springtime, the Sakura trees’ cherry blossoms bloom exuberantly with thousands of pink petals.  Holland Park is open every day from 7:30 a.m. until a half hour before dusk, and is free to the public. The nearest tube stations are Holland Park and Notting Hill stations, which are within a short walking distance of the park.",japanese gardens landscapes gardens design parks plants
187,Gearrannan Blackhouse Village,"Outer Hebrides, Scotland",Spend the night in this formerly abandoned traditional Scottish village.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gearrannan-blackhouse-village,"Huddled atop a hill overlooking the fierce Atlantic is a quaint cluster of stone cottages. This once-abandoned village both preserves a piece of the Outer Hebrides’ past and serves as a picturesque place for travelers to spend a night or two. This cluster of houses was built in the late 1800s. They’re the traditional blackhouses that once dotted the Hebridean landscape. For centuries, Highlanders and their livestock lived in these one-room abodes. The houses, which featured packed earth floors, drystone walls, and thatched roofs, offered refuge from the wild North Atlantic weather. A fire in the central hearth kept the space warm, and a divider separated the human inhabitants from their farm animals, which remained huddled at one end of the building. Between 1945 and 1965, the other crofts and blackhouses on the Isle of Lewis received running water and electricity. People lived in these houses until the 1970s, when the village’s remaining elderly residents moved into more modern homes that didn’t require as much upkeep. It seemed as though the village would then be lost to time, destined to crumble and decay until it was no more than a ruin. But in 1989, Urras nan Gearrannan, the local trust, set to work restoring and preserving these historic buildings. Now, the renovated blackhouses are available as holiday accommodation. Families can rent individual cottages, or budget travelers can hunker down in the hostel. Each building is named after the family that once lived there, and bits of the village serve as a museum that honors this bygone way of island life. You may even catch a glimpse of someone weaving Harris Tweed! While there, be sure to venture beyond the village. Its perch along the Isle of Lewis’ western coast offers prime access to spectacular coastal hikes.  For the hostel, prices are £20.00 per person per night. The Family Room costs £65.00 per night. It's recommended to book your bed in advance, although the hostel does accept walk-ins if space allows. You may also book the individual cottages online as well. The signage is in Gaelic, so wayfinding can be an interesting challenge. The locals speak English, but when not addressing tourists it is a great opportunity to listen to the language. Near this village is the Calloway Mill, where they process the wool to be made into Harris Tweed, send it out to the weavers on five-foot ""beams,"" and then clean the fabric that is returned, package it, and send it around the world where it is made into suit jackets, hats, wallets, and other items.

188,The Glasgow Necropolis,"Glasgow, Scotland","""Respectful to the dead, safe and sanitary to the living, dedicated to the Genius of Memory...""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glasgow-necropolis,"Fifty thousand bodies are buried in the 37 acres of the Glasgow Necropolis which sits on a hill adjacent to the Glasgow Cathedral. Monuments of every architectural style are here, designed by major architects and sculptors of the time, including Alexander ‘Greek’ Thomson, Charles Rennie Macintosh and JT Rochead. In 1832, The Cemeteries Act was passed in Britain, which allowed burial for profit. Before the act, the parish church held full responsibility for burying the dead. At the time, Glasgow had a growing population with fewer folks attending church, and the city was one of the first to take advantage of the act. In April 1833 the Victorian Glasgow Necropolis officially opened, and was an interdenominational burial ground with the first burial being Joseph Levi, a Jew, and a jeweler. A year later, the first Christian burial was of Elizabeth Miles, the stepmother of the Superintendent, George Mylne. Uncommon for its time, the necropolis kept records of the deceased, including ages, sex and cause of death. A bridge, known as the “Bridge of Sighs,” stands at the main entrance, and got its name for being part of the funeral processions route (also an allusion to the “Bridge of Sighs” in Venice). In 1838, ornate gates were erected, restricting access onto the bridge. Between the gate and the bridge are three modern memorials: one to the still-born children; one to the Korean War; and one to the Glaswegian recipients of the Victoria Cross. The cemetery opens daily at 7AM, and still attracts local and global visitors.",relics and reliquaries catacombs and crypts
189,Freddie Mercury's Former Home and Studio,"London, England",A makeshift shrine to the late rock star is still kept up on the nondescript façade outside 1 Logan Place.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/freddie-mercury-s-former-home-and-studio,"Garden Lodge Mansion is on a quiet residential street in Kensington, London. If it weren’t for the piles of sorrowful letters, you would never guess that it was once the home of one of rock music’s most irrepressible performers, Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. Mercury moved into the house in 1985, and decorated sumptuously. In the beginning, Garden Lodge was host to raucous parties and late night recording sessions in the attached studio. However, as Mercury’s health deteriorated he retreated from the public eye. Despite the fact that he denied his HIV positive diagnosis, began to spend less and less time performing and on camera, and more time at home in Garden Lodge. He grew increasingly frail, and in the final weeks of his life he was tended to by his former lover and best friend, Mary Austin. Mercury died on November 24, 1991. He left the home and much of his estate to Austin, wanting to secure a place for her and her sons. Contrary to his flamboyant stage persona, Freddie Mercury’s home life was secluded and private. This is reflected in Garden Lodge, which is surrounded by tall stone walls that shield the house and garden from view. Mercury was cremated and his ashes were interred in a secret location that Mary Austin states she will never disclose. Without a gravesite at which to pay their respects, fans flocked to 1 Logan Place to mourn. The stone walls were soon covered in letters and memorabilia, and on the green doors marked “Studio Gate” and “Garden Lodge” mourners etched their condolences. Mary Austin and her family still reside in Garden Lodge, where the decor is apparently much the same as Freddie Mercury left it. Outside on the street, though it has been more than two decades since Mercury’s death, Queen fans still leave letters, flowers, gifts, and graffiti to remember the singer. Update January 2019: The stone walls have recently been cleaned up with no sign of graffiti and letters left by Freddie’s fans. Fans continue to seek out the backstreet so it’s possible that soon that they won’t be bare long. However, Garden Lodge’s new back door warns that “graffiti is a crime” and points out that security cameras are in operation.",rock and roll shrines graffiti houses homes

Skara Brae’s inhabitants are thought to have been makers and users of “grooved ware,” a distinctive pottery style developed in northern Scotland not long before the establishment of the settlement. Skara Brae consists of ten clustered houses built of flat stones stacked within earthen dams, without mortar. Given the number of homes in the community, it seems likely that no more than fifty people lived in Skara Brae at any given time. The dwellings contain a number of stone-built pieces of furniture, including cupboards, dressers, seats, and storage boxes. A number of enigmatic carved stone artifacts have been found at the site. The purpose of these remains debated among scholars. It is also thought to be one of the earliest settlements to have a toilet and sewer system of some sort. Each individual hut released its waste into a central drainage system that carried it to the ocean. The stone drains were thought to be 14 to 24 inches high and lined with tree bark to make them watertight.

191,Giant's Causeway,"County Antrim, Northern Ireland",Northern Ireland's Brobdingnagian stepping stones.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giants-causeway,"Famed for its thousands of interlocking hexagonal columns that rise vertically like steps, the Giant’s Causeway is a geological oddity that looks distinctly man-made. In fact, the unusual formation was born of natural processes during the Paleogene (65-23 million years ago), when Northern Ireland was subject to powerful volcanic activity. During this period, molten basalt came into contact with chalk beds, forming a lava plateau. When the lava cooled quickly, the plateau contracted and cracked, forming 40,000 hexagonal columns of varying heights that look like giant stepping stones. The largest stand almost 36 feet tall. According to legend, an Irish giant by the name of Fionn mac Cumhaill constructed the causeway himself so that he could skip over to Scotland to defeat his Scottish rival, Benandonner. Apparently, while in transit to Scotland, Fionn fell asleep, and Benandonner decided to cross the causeway to look for his competitor. To protect her slumbering husband, Fionn’s wife gathered him up and wrapped him up in cloth in order to camouflage him as their child. When Benandonner made it to Northern Ireland he saw the large infant and could only imagine how big Fionn must be. Frightened, Benandonner fled back to Scotland. But the causeway remained. Although the phenomenon of basalt columns is relatively rare, there are a few dramatic examples of the rock formation found around the world, including Fingal’s Cave in Scotland, Los Prismas Basálticos in Mexico, and the Devil’s Postpile in California.  There is the option to take a shuttle bus from the visitor centre to the coastal area to explore; otherwise there is a 15 minute walk down the sloping landscape to get to the Causeway. The Causeway is free to visit. You do need to pay to enter the gift shop and visitor center. The cost can be found on their website, https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/giants-causeway. Pre-purchasing tickets can save you a little money on your trip. Sensible footwear is recommended, and a warm jacket; the coast is generally always colder than expected! Car parking at Causeway is for the visitor center. Other less expensive parking can be found at the nearby train station or in a field owned by a local farmer that opens during the summer. Alternatively, there is parking in the town of Bushmills and a shuttle bus goes back and forth to the causeway.",geological oddities geology

First occupied by Alderman David Henry Stone, who in 1874 was Lord Mayor of London. Shortly after moving to Fairwood Alderman Stone commissioned James Pulham & Son to build the folly.

Hunter had a reputation as a bit of a mad scientist, and the idiosyncratic collection reflects this. The museum houses one of the oldest collections of anatomical, pathological, and zoological specimens in the United Kingdom. The collection comprises more than 3,500 anatomical and pathological preparations, fossils, paintings, and drawings. One half of the brain of the famous mathematician Charles Babbage is on display (the other half is with his Difference Engine at the London Science Museum). Also in the collection are the Evelyn Tables, acquired from Italy in 1646 by John Evelyn, a prolific diarist best known for his detailed journals written during the Great Fire of London in 1666. The tables are wooden slabs of “mounted dry tissue” displaying veins and arteries from dissections and are the earliest known anatomical preparations in Europe. The surgical instruments carried by doomed Scottish explorer Mungo Park are also in the collection. John’s older brother, also a noted physician, anatomist, and collector bequeathed his belongings to the University of Glasgow, Scotland, forming the basis for the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow. Update: The Hunterian Museum is currently closed to the public while it undergoes renovations. According to its website, the museum will open again to the public in early 2023.

194,Lullaby Factory,"London, England",Wedged between two buildings at the Great Ormond Street Hospital is this secret music installation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lullaby-factory,"Between a new and old building at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London is a secret music machine. The Lullaby Factory was installed in 2012 and is a concoction of pipes and horns that covers one of the hospital’s old brick buildings. It’s lodged in a courtyard that was created when a new glass building was constructed next door. The older hospital is slated to be torn down in 2028, but Studio Weave designed this hidden sound installation to add discovery and joy for the young patients at the hospital. You can listen to the music created by sound artist Jessica Curry beneath different towering metal devices, some components of which were salvaged from an old hospital boiler. For those children who are unable to leave their hospital rooms, the music from the Lullaby Factory is available to be piped in through radios.  To find it, enter the children's hospital, opposite number 47 Great Ormond Street. At the reception desk, ask for directions to the Lagoon restaurant. At one side of the restaurant, you will find the instruments at a very small deck. They are only accessible through large sliding doors which are open when the weather is warm. In winter you can only look out through the glass, but you will not be able to hear anything. Update July 2017:  The pipes and horns are there, but there's been no music for years. Cafeteria/restaurant workers had no idea where or what it was. The deck below is now fitted with patio seating and is protected with netting which obscures the view. A knowledgeable employee said that children are told to whisper their wishes and prayers into the base of the tubes in hopes that they will fly to the heavens.

195,The Morpeth Arms,"London, England","A historic London pub with prison cells in the cellar and a ""spy room"" on the second floor.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-morpeth-arms-london-england,"The Morpeth Arms is among the creepiest of old pubs in London. In addition to originally being used as a prison and transfer facility for the old Millbank penitentiary, the building was also a deportation holding centre for convicts being shipped off to Australia. Convicts would be led from their cells at Millbank through the tunnels below ground, where they would be locked up temporarily before being taken aboard a ship or a carriage. The tension of the space can still be felt in the air, which has a distinctly eerie vibe. Millbank Prison closed in 1890, but the underground cells remained. It’s now a typical London pub with beer, food, and loyal patrons, but the dark history of the cells in the basement hasn’t been forgotten. Bar staff have reported seeing movements or items replaced, and a general feeling of unease when closing up at the end of the night. The phantom feelings have gotten to the point there’s a closed-circuit TV with a camera fixed on the cells monitoring for spectral activity. The other notable feature of Morpeth Arms is its “Spying Room.” The room is on the second floor of the pub, decorated in a 1920s style and themed after Mata Hari, the infamous dancer and double agent. Its windows, which just so happen to look out upon the British Intelligence Service building across the street, are adorned with binoculars so pub patrons can spy on the spies. MI6 and FBI agents are said to occassionally call in for a pint.  If you're there to drink, after work is crowded but lively and fun. If you want to try and access the cellar, go late (or early). If you ask nicely and the bar backs are feeling accommodating, you might just be able to tour the cells below. Nearest Tube station is Pimlico. As of May 2017, public access has sadly been severely limited due to health & safety issues. A CCTV screen is set up in the bar, but tours are no longer allowed.

196,Longleat Hedge Maze,"Wiltshire, England",The longest hedge maze in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/longleat-hedge-maze,"Added to the historic grounds of the stately home of Longleat in 1975, the Longleat Hedge Maze in England is the largest of several mazes on the property. The maze is constructed of more than 16,000 English yews and is the longest (but not the largest) hedge maze in the world, covering 1.48 acres and 1.69 miles of pathway. It is a full-scale maze, with several dead ends and multiple paths punctuated by six raised bridges, all of which surround a central tower. The maze is part of the 8,000 acres that have been the home of the Marquesses of Bath since 1541. 900 of those acres were laid out by the famous landscape designer Capability Brown, who also had a hand in the grounds of Alnwick Castle (now home to the Alnwick Poison Gardens). The property includes a slew of unusual features, not least of which is the Safari Park of exotic animals that has been open to the public since 1966. Designed as the first drive-through safari park, there over 500 wild animals can roam freely. According to the Safari Park web site: “Despite the understandable initial concerns of locals with regard to the introduction of lions to Wiltshire, the Safari Park concept has been a great success and Longleat’s ground-breaking innovation has been repeated at wildlife collections all over the world.” Before his death in 2020, the land was owned by the 7th Marquess of Bath, Alexander Thynn, known primarily for his eccentric lifestyle, numerous mistresses, and the erotic murals he painted all over the residential portion of the house. He was also a great lover of mazes, and added the hedge maze, as well as three other smaller garden mazes: the Lunar Labyrinth, the Sun Maze, King Arthur’s Maze, and the Love Labyrinth. The historic house, gardens, hedge maze, and safari park are open to visitors.

197,London's Original and All-Inspiring Coffee House,"London, England",The site of London's first coffee house has been serving refreshments of one kind or another for 360 years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/londons-original-all-inspiring-coffee-house,"In 1652 the first coffee house in London was opened on St Michael’s Alley, off Cornhill, set within a warren of medieval streets. In truth, it was less coffee house and more wooden coffee shack, but it had the enviable advertising distinction of being situated below the spire of St Michael’s Church, visible all over London. It was operated by Pasqua Rosee, a servant or possibly valet to the businessman Daniel Edwards, who was an importer of goods from Turkey that included coffee. There are two stories as to how the coffee house came to be established. One is that Rosee had a falling out with Edwards and left his employ to set up the business. Another, and probably the more likely, is that visitors to Edwards’ home to try this new and exotic drink became too many and too frequent, so Edwards helped Rosee set up as a public vendor. There doesn’t appear to be a definitive name given for Rosee’s establishment. Some accounts refer to it as being called “The Turk’s Head,” while a plaque on display in St Michael’s Alley today refers to it as being the site of “The Sign of Pasqua Rosee’s Head.” Indeed, it was Rosee’s own profile which graced his coffee house sign. Resplendent in a turban and sporting a twirly moustache, the image of the head of a man of Turkish origin became the default sign for all coffee houses. It should be noted that the first coffee house to be established in England was located in Oxford. It was opened in 1651 by a Jewish man named Jacob and called the Angel. However, a pamphlet distributed by Rosee extolling the “virtue of the coffee drink” named himself as the first to make and sell the beverage in England. Sadly, despite Rosee’s being a hugely popular gathering place and a centre for creativity and communication – and spawning hundreds of rival establishments around the capital – it (and he) was short-lived. There is evidence that he intended to open another coffee house in a permanent establishment on Cornhill, “adjacent Newman’s Court,” but all historical record of Pasqua Rosee ceases from 1658. His intended Cornhill location is now, ironically, a Starbucks. And in another twist of coffee-related fate, the location of the house Rosee shared with Mr. Edwards, at 38 Walbrook, is also now occupied by Starbucks. The site of Rosee’s original coffee house was re-built after the great fire of London in 1666 and re-opened by another proprietor as the Jamaica Coffee House. Re-built again in the 19th Century, it continues serving drinks under the name of the Jamaica Wine House.",Unique Restaurants & Bars

Focusing on an interactive experience, the museum offers everything from prison artifacts for visitors to handle, to tours led by costumed guides, and even extended speeches by actors in character. The displays also feature audio and visual presentations and a number of realistic figures painted and dressed to look like the hoosegow’s prisoners and jailers.

199,Old Operating Theatre Museum & Herb Garret,"London, England","In this cobwebbed old operating theater, you can practically hear the screams of the unanesthetized patients.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-operating-theatre,"Housed in the attic of St. Thomas Church, Britain’s oldest surviving operating theater looks much as it might have in 1822. One surgeon who operated there described it thus: “the first two rows were occupied by the other dressers, and behind a second partition stood the pupils, packed like herrings in a barrel, but not so quiet.” The patient on the operating table would have been awake and staring right back at the surgeon, as anesthetics weren’t yet in use. Rather than anesthetics, patients were given a wooden cane to bite on to muffle the screams. Surgeons relied on swift amputation techniques, the faster you could remove a limb the better a surgeon you were and the higher the survival rates of the patients. Many patients died of infection, with only about one in three surviving the procedure, and the old frock coats worn by surgeons during operations were, according to a contemporary, ‘stiff and stinking with pus and blood.’ On the plus side, dead bodies could be used for dissection and further teaching of anatomy. Patients were brought into the theatre via a now-closed opening in the wall behind the current chalkboard. It led straight into the ward, where other patients were unfortunate enough to still be able to hear the screams during the operations, often amputations of limbs.  The ground was covered in sawdust to soak up the blood, but there was still enough of it for the original floorboards to show a lot of blood in later chemical analysis. The museum was founded by Richard Mead, a doctor of St Thomas, who had an interesting cure for venereal diseases: snail water anyone? The operating theater also has a collection of instruments for cupping, bleeding, and trepanning, or skull-drilling. Of interest in the attic is an old apothecary, formally known as the “Herb Garret”, which previously occupied the whole space before making room for the operating theater. It’s all up in the roof of a beautiful English Baroque church, complete with wooden spectator galleries. Some primary schools will take students here on field trips. This is one of the oldest operating theatres in Europe, and for the entrance staircase itself, it’s worth the visit. This is the place to thank God for morphine.  The museum is located in Central London, in the historic Borough of Southwark, just South of London Bridge, and opposite Guy's Hospital. It is only 2 minutes walk from London Bridge Underground Station, and a few minutes walk from the rebuilt Globe Theatre, Tower Bridge, HMS Belfast, Clink Prison and other attractions in Southwark. The entrance itself is part of the experience, but it is not friendly to any injuries or claustrophobia. There are many stairs in an incredibly tight space, but it lends to aiding the imagining of those patients back in the 1800s.",anatomical theaters pharmacy museums medical museums
200,Glenfinnan Viaduct,"Glenfinnan, Scotland","Now famous as the ""Harry Potter bridge,"" this impressive concrete viaduct has long been an icon in its own right.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glenfinnan-viaduct,"This giant curving viaduct is an iconic scene for any Harry Potter fans and hopeful Hogwarts attendees. But even if the Hogwarts Express hadn’t been shown chugging along the railroad on its way to the famous school of witchcraft and wizardry, this viaduct would still deserve to be an icon in its own right. The setting promises excellent views as the viaduct overlooks the waters of Loch Shiel and the Glenfinnan Monument. Built in the 1890s, this railroad viaduct was the first structure in Britain to be built with mass concrete. It was this innovative building method that allows the overpass to remain in such good shape today. The viaduct was constructed by Robert McAlpine and Sons under the control of Sir Robert McAlpine, who became so fond of constructing in concrete that he was given the nickname “Concrete Bob.” The crew built the 100-foot-tall, 416-yard-long bridge along an elegant curve, which lets train passengers look out the window and catch fantastic views of the other end of the train chugging along the tracks against a backdrop of beautiful Highland scenery. Despite its importance as a civil engineering icon and the clear beauty of its surroundings, the railway didn’t gain fame until it was used in several of the Harry Potter movies. In particular, fans will notably remember the scene featuring the viaduct, the Hogwarts Express, and Arthur Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia. It’s even nicknamed the “Harry Potter Bridge.” The Glenfinnan Viaduct appears on some banknotes as well. Apparently, since its brief role in the movies, the British Transport Police have had to put up signs to discourage trespassing following a number of near-misses between trains and Harry Potter fans, as the overpass is still very much in use. The diesel-powered West Highland Line frequently runs across it and there are regular steam-hauled excursions available in the summer. The iconic Jacobite steam train runs across the viaduct to Fort William and Mallaig. The train may pause at the viaduct, time permitting, to allow visitors to take in the magnificent views.",world's first pop culture railroads trains infrastructure
201,Whispering Gallery at St Paul’s Cathedral,"London, England",Hear the quietest sound from across the dome.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/whispering-gallery-at-st-paul-s-cathedral,"In the walkway that circles the inside of Christopher Wren’s great dome whispered words can be heard clearly directly across 137 feet. The trick of acoustics is an artifact of the perfection of the dome, which was completed in 1710. The current cathedral is thought to be the fourth cathedral on that spot, replacing the third incarnation which was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Wren, who had already been planning on retrofitting the existing cathedral, took on the monumental task of creating a new central cathedral. Astonishingly, he was also responsible for the rebuilding of an additional 50 parish churches during the same period. His design was modern and quite different than the earlier cathedral design, incorporating a massive dome designed in homage to St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. The first stone was laid in 1677, and it opened in 1697, just 32 years after the fire - a lighting quick build, in cathedral terms. The dome was completed after opening, and the building was declared complete in 1710. It is the largest cathedral in England, and considered Wren’s masterpiece. Wren became the first of many prominent people interred in St. Paul’s after his death in 1723. His epitaph reads “Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice”, Latin for “Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you”. St. Paul’s was struck by, but survived bombing raids in WWII, and remains an active church. The Whispering Gallery is one of three galleries accessible in the cathedral. It is located at the top of 259 steps, 99 feet above the floor of the cathedral, which is decorated with a compass rose.

202,Hyde Park Pet Cemetery,"London, England",The final resting place to 300 Victorian-era pets hides inside the city park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hyde-park-pet-cemetery,"Touching inscriptions to departed pets still mark the burial spots for hundreds of beloved animal companions buried between 1881 and 1915. Beginning with the internment of a Maltese terrier named Cherry, owned by friends of the park gatekeeper at the time, the tiny cemetery stayed open to burials until space ran out at the beginning of the 20th century. Although most of the headstones with inscriptions like “Darling Dolly – my sunbeam, my consolation, my joy” and “Prince. He asked for so little and gave so much” to the touching “In memory of our darling little Bobbit. When our lonely lives are over and our spirits from this earth shall roam, we hope he’ll be there waiting to give us a welcome home” show testimony for the Victorians’ love for their dogs and cats. There are also at least three monkeys and several birds remembered here as well. The cemetery sits inside Hyde Park’s 350 acres – which have been open to the public as parklands since 1637 –  tucked away by the gatekeeper’s cottage. Today the cemetery is managed by the Royal Parks, and is only visible through fences unless a special visit is arranged.  Located in Victoria Gate Lodge’s garden on Bayswater Road. The Pet Cemetery is not open to the general public, although, a special one-hour viewing can be arranged by contacting The Royal Parks. The cost is £60.00 for up to six people. The cemetery is possible to view from the outside by peering through the protective gate that surrounds the guard house.",pet cemeteries victorian graveyards graves gravestones parks cemeteries animals
203,Wistman's Wood,"Devon, England",This tangled English forest looks like something right out of a fairytale.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wistman-s-wood,"The moss-covered boulders, and twisted, ancient brambles of Wistman’s Wood are haunted by tales of druids, ghosts, and supernatural spooks. While that is all myth, it’s not hard to see why the forest is a magnet for such hokum. Wistman’s Wood is an ancient forest that has largely been left to grow wild, free of destruction, or shaping by humans or large animals. This is largely due to the treacherous, rocky ground at the base of the trees which make it difficult to traverse. The large, moss-covered boulders create countless small crevasses and places to trip and fall. With unfettered growth the trees have grown old and gnarled. The rocks have stunted their height, and the crooked branches hang down in an oppressive canopy. Given the evocative feel of the wood, it is no wonder that a number of supernatural tales have been attached to the forest. Many tales of ghosts and hauntings have been reported surrounding the wood, but the most prevalent myth revolves around hellhounds and druids. Legends tell of packs of fierce “Wisht Hounds,” huge black dogs with red eyes and a taste for blood. It is also a popular belief that the wood was a sacred place for druids to come and worship around the many impressive stones in the area. There are also tales of knots super-venomous adders waiting in between the rocks for foolish travelers to stumble upon. Unfortunately, mystical beasts and nature wizards only exist in stories. Yet Wistman’s Wood makes it seem so very possible that they could be real.",fairytales forests natural wonders ecosystems nature
204,St Michael's Mount,"Cornwall, England",A island reachable by a causeway at low tide is possibly one of the earliest Western European locations to be identified in text.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saint-micheals-mount,"Not to be confused with its counterpart Mont Saint-Michel in Normandy, St. Michael’s Mount in England is a civil parish and island accessible only during low tide. A manmade causeway of granite serves as a passage to the tidal island during times when the waters allow; otherwise, one must approach by boat. Although an underground railway exists to deliver goods to the castle from the harbor, its steep grading does not allow for passengers and is not even open to the public for viewing. One of 43 tidal islands within walking distance of mainland Britain, St Michael’s is (if historians are correct) one of the earliest locations identified in text in all of Western Europe. Believed to be mentioned by both Pliny the Elder’s Naturalis Historia as well as Greek historian Diodorus Siculus’ Bibliotheca historica, both scholars had access to the now non-existent texts of Pytheas, the ancient Greek geographer thought to have visited the island in 4th century BC. (It is still argued that the Diodorus Siculus reference to “Ictis,” a tin-trading center thought to be St Michael’s, is actually Looe Island, off of the coast of Cornwall). St. Michael’s has harbored its share of monastic buildings, abbeys, churches, and escapes for pilgrims and devotees. Battered by earthquakes, floods, and war, structures have come and gone, been rebuilt, and in one case, revealed the remains of an anchorite who had been sealed up in a chamber under the church in a makeshift tomb. In the present day, the island is home to a 15th-century chapel, a village made up of eight houses, an island cemetery acting as a final resting place for island residents and drowned sailors, and a castle, residence of Lord St Laven, John St Aubyn. The ancestral seat of the St Aubyn family, the island and castle was given to the National Trust in 1954 but remains the home of the family, who retained a 999-year lease. Tours of the island and parts of the castle are available, and there is a museum with several artifacts that pertain to the island’s long, colorful history.",islands sacred spaces

The initial aim of the space was to embellish the entirety of the interior and exterior of their home and garden. However, as the project developed it became a diary of their lives. From childhood, through bereavement, love, and a spiritual relationship with Mexico, to which Wright feels a special affinity, each little detail holds special meaning. All of this is combined with influences from Haiti and South America. Amongst the ubiquitous mosaics are large “Spirit” sculptures alongside shrines and hand-written memory boards recording events from the past, present, and future. The artworks are created from a wide range of materials such as dolls with disabilities, false teeth, used wigs, old toys, dirty used combs, and old wills, letters, and photographs collected from the junk markets of Paris, Brussels, Budapest, and other European cities. Recently Vince Rogers, a filmmaker from the BBC produced a short film about the project using archive film going back to 1998. A Canadian TV Channel is also currently producing a short documentary about the House of Dreams Museum. Wright and his current partner Michael Vaughan have also recently produced a book about the home. Alongside these indelible documents of the cacophonous home, Wright’s works have been bestowed to the National Trust so that when the death visible in so much of Wright’s work comes for the artist himself, the House of Dreams will live on.  You must buy a ticket for the day of your visit. Check the website well before your intended visit as it's often sold out months in advance.

206,The Witchery,"Edinburgh, Scotland","Near the former site of numerous witch burnings, this lavish Edinburgh mainstay pays homage to Scotland's brutal history.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-witchery,"Edinburgh’s famed culinary destination delights contemporary patrons with fine Scottish cuisine and luxe, broody atmosphere. But rewind four centuries, and residents of this old-world landmark lived only a stone’s throw away from the convicted witches burned to death on nearby Castlehill. Nestled in Boswell’s Court amid a cluster of historic buildings at the gates of Edinburgh Castle, The Witchery is housed in a former abode built for merchant Thomas Lowthian in 1595. Visitors can still make out his initials and his motto, “O Lord in thee is all my traist,” at the door. Boswell’s Court is named after a previous resident, John Boswell, the uncle of James Boswell. James was known for being the biographer of Doctor Samuel Johnson, not to mention a clue in crossword puzzles. Johnson was a famous English poet and playwright, as well as the writer of the first comprehensive English Dictionary . The two are reported to have dined together at this location towards the end of the 18th century. Following Lowthian’s residence at Boswell’s Court, the building served as a committee chamber for clergy members of the Church of Scotland and later, a rectory; but it’s The Witchery’s proximity to Castlehill, where hundreds were burned at the stake, that renders this gastronomic sensation a beguiling (if sinister) linchpin of the Edinburgh experience. It’s believed that some 4,000 accused witches were executed across Scotland between the late 16th century and the 1720s. This aggressive and ruthless witch hunt was most notably helmed by Mary Queen of Scots’ son King James VI of Scotland (and I of England) in the nation’s capital during his reign from 1603 until his death in 1625. James forged the only royal thesis condemning witchcraft titled Daemonologie, by which the hysteria over this “high treason against God” went mainstream and resulted in what historians believe was the highest concentration of witchcraft-related executions in the country. Named in memoriam of the innumerable accused, The Witchery was opened as a high-end eatery and inn by restaurateur/hotelier James Thomson OBE in 1979, thus breathing new life and theatrical flair into Boswell’s Court. Magnificent tapestries, paneled walls of 17th-century oak taken from the neighboring St. Giles Cathedral, and gilded accouterments adorn The Witchery’s lush Jacobean interior. The award-winning Secret Garden, The Witchery’s al-fresco component added on in 1990, provides a light and airy balance in juxtaposition to the rich opulence of the main dining space with a painted ceiling a la Rossend Castle in Fife, and a quartet of floor-to-ceiling French doors. Guests may also book one of nine theatrical hotel suites located just above The Witchery for an extended stay at one of Edinburgh’s most enchanting points of interest.  This site is not wheelchair accessible. Lunch is from 12 to 4:30 p.m., afternoon tea is from 3- 4.3:0pm, and dinner is from 4:30 - 11: 30 p.m. seven days a week.

207,Burke & Hare Murder Dolls,"Edinburgh, Scotland",Tiny effigies of the victims of Edinburgh's famous Anatomy Murders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burke-hare-murder-dolls,"Just a few years after the “Anatomy Murderers” William Burke and William Hare were apprehended in Edinburgh, two boys discovered these tiny dolls, each nested into a miniature coffin hidden away in the city park. At first theories on the dolls’ significance ranged from witchcraft to child’s toys, but eventually, it began to seem that the 17 tiny figures could be effigies for the 17 murder victims a decade earlier. There is also a belief that the figurines were meant to represent sailors lost at sea who hadn’t received a proper burial. Holyrood Park, where the dolls were discovered, has a clear view of the Firth of Forth estuary. Even the nearby St. Anthony’s Chapel ruins were said to act a lighthouse. There is a possibility that these were funeral effigies. Between 1827 and 1828, William Burke and William Hare lured in and murdered their lodgers in a scheme to provide fresh bodies to the local anatomy school. Dr. Robert Knox, a brilliant and well-known local anatomy lecturer, purchased the bodies and most likely knew that something was a bit suspicious about his supply chain. The crimes were exposed when another lodger discovered the body of a previous tenant and reported it to the police. Burke and Hare were apprehended along with Burke’s mistress, Helen McDougal, and Hare’s wife, Margaret Laird. Despite finding the body of this last lodger in Knox’s classroom, ready for dissection, the evidence was not truly damning until Hare turned on Burke and gave a full confession. William Burke was hanged in January 1829. His body was handed over for dissection, and his skeleton and a book bound from his skin remain in the collection of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. The four-inch-long dolls were in the hands of a private collector until 1901, when eight of them were handed over to the National Museum of Scotland where they can be visited today. Although it is generally agreed that the mysterious little dolls are associated with the crimes of Burke & Hare, no one is certain who among the killers created them. DNA studies conducted in 2005 using DNA extracted from Burke’s skeleton attempted to prove that they had been created to assuage the guilty conscience of William Burke, but the test proved inconclusive so the truth of their creation may never be known. It has been theorized that the body of the dolls were made from wooden toy soldiers that were popular at the time, post the Napoleonic War. All the dolls are wearing military-style boots and there is a line across their foreheads, indicating some form of a hat. It has been speculated that the dolls were the work of a cobbler. Tools used to carve the coffins are similar to those used by persons of this profession. As are the hinges and nails used in their construction. Burke’s death mask and skeleton are on display in the Edinburgh University Anatomy museum and a book bound in his skin is across town at the Surgeon’s Hall Museum.  Daith Comes In Gallery, Level 4 1/2, National Museum of Scotland. Access to the museum is free. The most direct line to the dolls is to take the lift/elevator at the back of the museum to Level 5 and take the first set of stairs down one flight. Look for the wooden hearse & metal coffin.

208,Buchanan Castle,"Drymen, Scotland",This castle was established by the 4th Duke of Montrose and is connected to the Buchanan Clan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buchanan-castle,"The stately Buchanan Castle was once a grand Scottish country house before it was swept up in World War II and subsequently abandoned to the overgrowth. After the first castle built on the site burned to the ground in 1850, Buchanan Castle was built on its ashes to serve as the grand home of a family of dukes. The house was built in the traditional baronial style with pointed towers and asymmetrical living areas to give the royalty the opulent house they felt they deserved. The royals lived in the house until 1925 when the home was turned into a hotel complete with a golf course. However, once the Second World War began, the estate was taken over for the war effort and turned into a hospital. During this time, the stately house of healing saw a number those wounded in the war, most famously attending to Rudolph Hess, Hitler’s right-hand man, after he flew to Scotland in 1941. After the war ended the building was briefly used as a school, but was eventually partially demolished and left to nature. Today, the golf course remains and is still in use, but the castle grounds themselves are covered in creeping plants that are slowly covering all of the still-standing walls. Update as of April 2021: The castle is now fenced off and best viewed from a safe distance.  Located between Buchanan Castle Golf Club and the housing estate.",castles military history military ruins

Accessed via a dark and uninviting alley, through a heavily disguised door with a polished brass skull as a handle, a staircase leads into a basement beneath a 200-year-old building. Along a corridor in this basement, a further series of rock-cut steps lead into the cavernous void beneath the city. The final descent into the Lost Caves is by escort, as they have a strict maximum occupancy. Here, 26 feet below the venerable old George Hotel, which has accommodated guests as diverse as Charles Dickens and Elizabeth Taylor, is a most unlikely gin palace. When, why, and by whom these deep grottoes were excavated is unknown, however, they do appear to have been adapted for the purpose of storing and brewing ale on rock-cut ledges. Instead of holding barrels of beer, these rock ledges now make a cosy cushion-strewn perch upon which gin and cocktail aficionados can sample the bar’s latest below-ground beverage creations. It is also worth remembering that it’s just as difficult to find the way out of the Lost Caves as it is to find the way in, so visitors are advised to moderate their cave cocktail consumption with escape in mind!  The access to the Lost Caves is somewhere in the vicinity of the George Hotel and The Lost Property Bar. Dress warmly.

210,Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls,"Isle of Skye, Scotland",Ancient cliffs resembling a kilt on Scotland's second largest island emit an entrancing sound.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kilt-rock-and-mealt-falls,"On the Inner Hebridean Isle of Skye are two spectacular sights, both visible from the same observation point on the Trotternish Peninsula. One of these is the magnificent 90 meter Kilt Rock, which looks strikingly similar to a pleated kilt. Made up of basalt columns resting on a sandstone base, one might even say that the colors of the rock formation appear almost tartan. The other point of interest is the Mealt waterfall, which, fed from nearby Mealt Loch, plummets from the top of the cliffs to the rock-laden coast below. Beyond these visual treats there is also an aural element to the site. When a strong wind is blowing while one observes the sights, a beautiful yet haunting tone appears to come from the surrounding area. Disguised, the instrument emitting the eerie noise is actually the fencing that surrounds the lookout point. Holes facing the sea allow wind in to the piping, turning the safety feature into an organ of sorts to accompany the breathtaking views off the north-eastern coast of Skye. On clear days, the Isle of Lewis and even mainland Scotland can be seen from the Trotternish Peninsula. About 17 km north of Portree, up Staffin Road, and just 2 km shy of Staffin, the observation point can be found.

211,The Quiraing,"Isle of Skye, Scotland","Islanders once used this dramatic, otherworldly landscape to hide their cattle from Viking raiders.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-quiraing,"This is the kind of place that leaves you breathless, and not just because you have to trek uphill. The craggy landscape looks like something from a magical realm. Its ridges roll toward the sky like great green waves and little lakes nestled at their feet darken and seem to dance beneath the passing clouds. Though it looks like a serene scene straight from a dream, the Quiraing was formed by terrestrial turmoil. It’s one of Britain’s largest landslips, and was created due to strain within its underlying layers of rock. It’s part of the Trotternish landslip, which also created the equally beautiful Old Man of Storr. But unlike at the Storr, the earth at the Quiraing isn’t done wriggling around just yet—the road at its base has to be repaired yearly because the land still shifts a few centimeters each year. But as inconvenient (and costly) as the constant road repairs may be, there’s no denying the constant movement has created an utterly amazing landscape. Jagged cliffs, towering rock pinnacles, and various dips and valleys create a rich tapestry of textures, forming a vivid feast for the eyes. Trails wind through the geological wonder, letting you wander among its many rock formations. The views are spectacular from any angle. As such, it’s no wonder people have been drawn to the land for thousands of years. Its name comes from a Norse saying for “Round Fold;” a nod to the Isle of Skye’s Viking history. It’s been said the islanders used to hide their cattle from Viking raiders within the Quiraing’s many nooks and crannies.  The Quiraing gets pretty busy, especially during peak tourist season (summer). But if you get there early in the morning, you'll be able to enjoy its beauty almost by yourself without having to trudge behind throngs of tourists. The trails can be steep at times and get slippery when wet, so wear sturdy hiking shoes and be sure you stick to the proper paths.",trails intriguing environs natural wonders ecosystems geology nature
212,Old Calton Cemetery,"Edinburgh, Scotland",A 18th century graveyard and its astonishing cortege of macabre iconography.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-calton-cemetery,"If you’re lucky enough to be in Edinburgh, don’t forget to have a lazy Sunday stroll in the Old Calton Cemetery, and zig-zag between the most elaborate and stunning examples of funeral arts in all of Scotland. Established on the northeast side of the city center in 1718, the Calton gives a spookily authentic feeling of being trapped in a Hammer film setting, expecting the devilish Black Donald at any moment of this delightful promenade. The graves and mausoleum of this Scottish “Pere Lachaise” cemetery vie with each other for the title of most quirky and elegant. Several notable people of Edinburgh’s history rest here, including philosopher David Hume, publisher William Blackwood and clergyman Dr. Robert Candlish; beyond that, several sober-looking monuments mark the resting place of martyrs past. Skulls and macabre symbolism are elegantly carved in each of the stones, and silent alleys invite visitors to wander. The sepulchral beauty of the Calton Cemetery offers a fascinating journey through the last memorial of forgotten strangers. The cemetery is also home to the only monument to the American Civil War outside the U.S. A statue of Abraham Lincoln standing over a freed slave was dedicated on August 21, 1893. This was also the first statue of a U.S. president outside the U.S. borders and remains the only one of Lincoln within Scotland. The six soldiers commemorated on the monument all fought for the Union. Unbeknown to a lot of people is that the cemetery is divided into two parts by Waterloo Place. A much smaller section can be accessed by turn the corner on Calton Hill, a road to the left just before the steps up to Calton Hill. The bodies that were removed to make way for Waterloo Place were carefully transported to New Calton Burial Ground, less than a half a mile to the east. At the southeastern corner lie the sole remains of the notorious Calton Jail.

213,Vatican Necropolis,Vatican City,Hidden beneath the famous St. Peter's Basilica is a veritable city of the dead that may hold the remains of St. Peter himself.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vatican-necropolis,"St. Peter’s Basilica is an astounding and massive wonder, filled with sculpture, art, frescoes, woodworking, reliquaries, and more.  But not many people know that five stories beneath this architectural marvel lie ruins that date back to the founding of the Roman Empire. If you stand near the altar at St. Peter’s (it’s the one with the enormous and incredible Bernini baldacchino under the central dome), you’ll be looking at a point that is stacked upon 2,000 years of history, represented by the preserved artifacts of six different historical periods. Upon entrance to the Scavi, or Vatican Necropolis, you are led down three levels to a 1st century AD Pagan burial ground with some small clay and stone repositories, above which is a 5th century Pagan and Christian combined burial ground with several medium-sized stone mausolea and some other ruins, which include a fractured piece of a large triumphal arch.  Roughly speaking, these two levels and the periods during which they would have been used account for nearly 90% of the span of the Roman Empire (27 BC – 476 AD). Between these levels and the next is a small earthen mound with a hole dug out of it, which is lit and lightly cordoned off, and contains what are said to be the bones of St. Peter himself, as well as the rock on which the original church was first built, in accordance with the edict found in Matthew 16:18-19 , “Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam…“  Two levels above this spot, this text is inscribed in a ring around the dome above in gold and blue frescoes, in letters roughly 20 feet tall, and the dome’s central point is directly above. The next level is a 12th century early Christian church, in the ceiling of which are actually grates up into the floor of the basilica, and the Papal grotto is within this labyrinth as well.  Visiting the necropolis can only be done through an advanced reservation. Requests must be made in writing and groups are limited to 12 people, all of which must be 15 years of age or over. The excavation site can be quite hot even in winter as it is humidity-controlled to preserve the structures. Keep this in mind when choosing what to wear for the day, as you’ll likely want to dress in layers but will still need to comply with the dress code for visiting a holy site (shoulders covered, women in pants or skirts below the knee.) The entrance is very difficult to find, walk around the outside of St  Peter’s square. You’re looking for the Swiss Guard up the border path on the outside of The Vatican on the left side if you’re facing the Basilica steps, not the Swiss Guard posted at the Arco del Campane.

214,Gallery of Maps - Galleria delle Carte Geografiche,Vatican City,Breathtaking and huge 430 year old maps of Italy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gallery-of-maps-galleria-delle-carte-geografiche,"Predating a unified Italy by nearly 300 years, the gallery of maps at the Vatican shows the length and breadth of the peninsula circa 1580. Pope Gregory XIII commissioned the maps from his cosmographer, the multi-talented Italian priest Ignazio Danti. Danti had come to Rome from his post as mathematics professor in Bologna to help the pope with his efforts to correct the inaccurate Julian Calendar using modern Renaissance mathematics and astronomy. At the time, cartography was undergoing its own renaissance. The age of exploration had brought new knowledge of distant lands, and technical innovations like the magnetic compass, sextant, and telescope improved accuracy. By the late 1500s the famous mapmakers Mercator and Ortelius were creating their landmark world maps. More significantly, before Danti took up his post in Bologna, he had spent a decade creating the magnificent hall of maps known as the Sala delle Carte Geografiche at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence at the behest of Cosimo I de Medici, duke of Florence. Maps were not new at the Vatican. Huge maps of the known world capped by a ceiling of stars were painted in the early 1500s in the Loggia della Cosmografia under the guidance of Pope Julius II (primarily remembered for commissioning Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel). To top that, Gregory set his sights on the 120 meter long corridor on the third floor of the Belvedere Courtyard. The ambitious project to install 40 enormous and highly accurate maps began in 1580 and took just 18 months to complete. Details of the large frescoes show the Siege of Malta, the Battle of Lepanto and large-scale maps of the maritime republics of Venice and Genoa. One map shows the Battle of Fornovo, the first battle in the Italian Wars against France. Each regional map is accompanied by a detailed view of its major city. The ceiling frescoes illustrate stories from the lands depicted below. Danti is also credited with the brass orrery that sits in the hall. The gallery was restored and enhanced under Pope Urban VIII a century after it was created. Most visitors today pass through the gallery on their way to the Sistine Chapel as part of the Vatican Museums.",vatican dead explorers marvelous maps and measures repositories of knowledge
215,La Resurrezione,Vatican City,If you want to talk to the Pope you will have to stare down this surreal vision of Jesus rising from a nuclear hell.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-resurrezione,"Looming over the main stage of the Paul VI Audience Hall in Vatican City, La Resurrezione by sculptor Pericle Fazzini depicts a thoroughly modern resurrection scene that dwarfs the sitting Pope as he receives his general audience. Installed in 1977, the massive sculptural piece shows a rapturous Jesus figure held aloft on plumes of twisted metal brambles. Made of a bronze-copper alloy, the gigantic piece of religious misery stands over 20 feet tall and over 60 feet long, weighing in at a whopping eight tons. While the imposing display is fairly abstract, it is said to specifically depict Christ rising from a nuclear crater, invoking the 20th century fear of the bomb. The thick fumes of toxic smoke portrayed in the piece almost seem to writhe beneath the over-sized Son of God. This evocative piece is located in the audience hall used by the Pope to deliver his less popular general audiences and oratories. These smaller (by comparison) events offer a chance to get a bit more up close and personal with the Pope, but one must still confront the beauty and (the horror) of La Resurrezione.",vatican sculptures
216,Stufetta del Bibbiena,Vatican City,The Vatican's secret porn-festooned bathroom was painted in erotic murals by one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stufetta-del-bibbiena,"A tiny bathing chamber in the Vatican’s Papal Apartments was painted in 1516 by Raphael for one Cardinal Bibbiena, a good friend of the pope and apparently, a fan of the erotic decorative arts. Bibbiena, known in his pre-Cardinal life as Bernardo Dovizi, was a writer, lover of the arts, and something of a libertine. When he moved into the Vatican, he sought out Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino, better known as the artist Raphael. Generally known for more sanctified images, Raphael produced some of the most magnificent religious paintings and portraits of the Renaissance. But apparently, he was willing to do a little side work. Located within the private papal apartments, the murals imitate many of the frescos uncovered in classical era Roman building throughout the empire, featuring frolicsome nymphs and satyrs. The pope at the time of the painting was Pope Leo X, formerly known as Giovanni di Lorenzo de’ Medici, and a close friend of the Cardinal. The Medici pope was known for his support of the arts, and indeed sponsored other Vatican works by Raphael and other notable Renaissance artists. Purportedly, upon his being named as Pope, he commented to his brother, “Since God has given us the Papacy, let us enjoy it.” Stufetta della Bibbiena means, roughly, Bibbiena’s warm room, and once served as a bathroom. Over the years the erotic wall coverings have been ignored, covered, and the room converted for different uses. The images are more playful nudes and suggestive mythological beasts than raunch, but there are some titillating exceptions. There is an image that depicts Pan, the goat god of nature, moving away from some bushes somewhat aroused. This was decided to be a little too offensive for the church and efforts were made to censor it, however this only made it appear larger and more noticeable. In 2011, writer Tony Perrottet wrote about his coup: he successfully finagled himself into the normally off limits room, and personally explored the tiny room. He described the details of the panels: “Raphael had designed his frescoed panels like a graphic novel, recounting the adventures of Venus, the goddess of love, and Cupid, the god of erotic desire, for Cardinal Bibbiena to admire as he lounged in his hot tub. At knee level, the original silver faucet was crafted into the face of a leering satyr. One panel showed the naked goddess stepping daintily into her foam-fringed shell. In others, she admires herself in a mirror, lounges between Adonis’ legs and swims in sensual abandon. A couple of the frames, even more risqué, have been destroyed. One, recorded by an early visitor, showed Vulcan attempting to rape Minerva.” Raphael painted a portrait of the cardinal the same year. It now hangs at Palazzo Pitti in Florence.",vatican erotic intriguing environs ecosystems
217,Vatican Mosaic Studio,Vatican City,A hidden workshop for creating and restoring Papal mosaic masterpieces.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vatican-mosaic-studio,"Back in the late 16th century, Pope Gregory XIII became pretty much obsessed with mosaics. He brought Venetian mosaic artists to Vatican City specifically to teach their trade to Roman craftsmen, who soon set about decorating parts of St. Peter’s Basilica, including the Gregorian Chapel and the Dome of Michelangelo. Such was the success of this new artistic initiative that mosaics spread to other cupolas in the Basilica, becoming an integral part of this masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. It wasn’t until 1727, however, that the Studio del Mosaico Vaticano (Vatican Mosaic Studio) was formally established. The studio is tucked away in a comparatively unassuming building in Vatican City. Here, a handful of highly talented artists and craftsmen have worked tirelessly over the years to restore the 10,ooo square meters of mosaics in Saint Peter’s Basilica, while at the same time creating original mosaic masterpieces. These artists were also pioneers of the filate enamels technique, which allowed them to create minuscule mosaic tiles that comprise the incredibly detailed works in the Basilica, which to the untrained eye often look more like paintings than mosaics. But the work of the studio certainly doesn’t begin and end with the Basilica. It also produces mosaic pieces by commission, of varying sizes and normally inspired by religious works, which are sold throughout the world. The Pope, and many Pontiffs before him, also requests original works from the studio. These are traditionally given as gifts to visiting heads of state. Over the last two centuries, recipients have ranged from the King of France Charles X to U.S. President Bill Clinton, the latter receiving a mosaic landscape.  The area in which the Vatican Mosaic Studio is located is off-limits to the general public, so you’ll need to visit with an official tour guide. There’s a shop on site, but don’t expect to pick up any bargain mosaics to send home; these things don’t come cheap.",vatican pope mosaics catholic religion sacred spaces art
218,'The Vision of Constantine',Vatican City,This equestrian statue of Constantine the Great has been the subject of criticism for centuries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-vision-of-constantine,"In 312, shortly before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, Constantine I—known as the first Roman ruler to convert to Christian faith—prayed along with his army. While doing so, it’s said a cross miraculously appeared in the sky with the inscription In Hoc Signo Vinces, or “By this sign you shall conquer.” With this divine encouragement, the emperor went into battle and successfully defeated Maxentius. Over a millennium later, in 1654, Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini was commissioned by the Vatican City to create an equestrian sculpture. Initially, it was designed to be placed in the interior of St Peter’s Basilica, but much to Bernini’s chagrin, Pope Alexander VII decided that it should be constructed at the foot of the Scala Regia, the stairway that connects the basilica to the Vatican Palace. This caused a big problem for the sculptor, as the marble block he had chosen was too small to fit the niche, making the statue seem dwarfed and out of proportion. In the end, Bernini sculpted an extensive marble drape behind Constantine the Great to make up for the space. It was finally completed in 1670 after the Scala Regia was restored by Bernini himself from 1663 to 1666. The statue is purposely placed so that the sunlight that pours into the basilica gives the sense of a God-sent vision. Despite Bernini’s effort and work, the sculpture was met with a volley of criticisms immediately after its unveiling. Contemporary writers pointed out various “problems”, while others complained that the cross was not viewable to most people and that the statue lacked realism. Even today, “The Vision of Constantine” continues to be a subject of criticism, albeit for different reasons. To most visitors to the Vatican, it’s only visible from a single viewpoint under the basilica’s portico. This inaccessibility has caused the statue to receive little attention in art history, and still remains relatively obscure an attraction.",religion sculptures sacred spaces statues history & culture
219,Vatican City Walls,Vatican City,"Historic fortifications form the boundary of Vatican City, but it’s not entirely surrounded by walls.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vatican-city-walls,"Medieval and Renaissance walls form the boundary of Vatican City, but do not enclose it entirely. For the millions of tourists who visit the independent city-state each year, an occasional metal detector is the only thing that might slow them down. Historically speaking, surrounding a town or city with walls was rarely a bad idea. Pirates, raiders, and rival states were just a few threats to a settlement, making fortifications a wise investment of time and money. Vatican City was no exception. The first major fortification of Vatican City was completed in 852. Following an attack by Saracen raiders in 846, Pope Leo IV ordered the construction of a wall around the Leonine City, an area that covered the current Vatican territory and the Borgo district of Rome. The 39-foot-tall Leonine Wall, as it became known, stretched for a little under two miles as it encircled Vatican Hill. It was the first time the area had been completely enclosed. Once the Muslim threat had passed, many of the city gates were opened. Paul III and Pius IV later expanded and modified the fortifications in the 16th century, partly as a statement of political power but also to protect against political violence in Rome. Further modifications were made up until the end of the reign of Pope Urban VIII in the 1640s. These historic walls still exist along most of the boundary of Vatican City today. But the 110-acre city-state is far from being an impenetrable fortress. Anyone can stroll into St. Peter’s Square, where a white line painted on the ground is the only boundary. And of the six entrances into Vatican City, three are open to the public. Some parts of Vatican City are off-limits. But everywhere else is easily accessible, the only barriers to a quick entrance being the queues and an occasional metal detector. Even the Vatican Library, famous for its secret archives and Dan Brown-escapades, is easy enough to enter if you have a Vatican library card. As Ken Pennington, a professor of medieval history at the Catholic University of America, told The New York Times: “When I am there I show the guards my library card and they let me right in. It’s the only place in the world where a library card gets you into a country.”  Vatican City is an independent city-state enclaved within Rome. Visitors do not need a visa or even a passport to enter, but some visitors might be asked for identification, so it’s a good idea to take your passport, national ID card, or driver’s license.",enclaves walls catholic christianity
220,Domus Sanctae Marthae,Vatican City,These spartan apartments are provided to clergymen visiting Vatican City.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/domus-sanctae-marthae,"While many visitors to Vatican City simply look for affordable lodging while in Rome, the Domus Sanctae Marthae is the accommodation of choice for the College of Cardinals and other Catholic holy men. Otherwise known as the Casa Santa Marta, the five-story building lies on the edge of Vatican City. Built in 1996 by Pope John Paul II to make papal visits easier on the aging clergymen who had been staying at lodgings farther afield, the 131 rooms are the temporary home for clergy when they are in the Vatican on official Holy See business, providing comfortable but not overly proud accommodations. However, when the College of Cardinals are summoned to elect a new pope, the guesthouse clears for the cardinals. The windows are then shuttered and locks are placed throughout in order to ensure privacy.

221,Shajarat-al-Hayat (Tree of Life),Bahrain,This centuries-old tree tells an unusual tale of vegetation and fertility in the desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tree-of-life,"Impossibly squeezing the moisture from grains of sand, one tree in Bahrain has found a way to thrive in the desert. The Sharajat-al-Hayat or Tree of Life has stood alone in a brutally harsh climate for over 400 years in a remote desert location. Lacking any visible source of water, the 32-foot mesquite tree has baffled visitors and scientists alike for its entire life as it has continued to grow. Although the mesquite tree is known for holding a great deal of water in its massive root system, there is still no source of water in sight. Even arid vegetation needs water to survive, which makes Bahrain’s Tree of Life even more mysterious. Without a rational explanation for the tree’s biological success, many have turned to mythology and religion for answers. Some assert that Enki, an ancient god of water in Babylonian and Sumerian mythology, protects the tree. Others still believe the site is the historical location of the Garden of Eden. Whatever the answer, the tree has shown no sign of dying, and continues to inspire as it stands proudly in the tiny desert nation. Only a mile from the tree is the hazy Jebel Dukhan, the highest point in Bahrain. From 440 feet above sea level, the hill allows for a true appreciation of the barren landscape in which this tree has thrived.",flora deserts trees natural wonders plants nature
222,Arad Fort,"Arad, Bahrain","This beautifully historic Bahrain fortress might not be the most popular attraction around, but that might make it all the better.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arad-fort,"A 15th century Islamic fort stands well preserved off the coast of Bahrain, a testament to its sturdy construction (and reconstruction). A short five minute drive from the sleek modernity of Bahrain’s International Airport sits one of the oldest archaeological sites on the island. Arad Fort is not as large or as celebrated as its nearby sibling the Bahrain Fort, but it is this reason that Arad is worth a trip, as a visitor will often find themselves the only person there inside the fort, allowing one to absorb the history uninterrupted. Built in the 15th century using traditional Islamic building techniques (palm trees, the abundance of coral limestone found on the beaches), Arad Fort was constructed on a strategically important waterway linking the small island with the rest of Bahrain, and to aid in keeping invading marauders out. Bahrain was at one time the seat of power and trading in the ancient Arabian Gulf, the heart of what was then known as the Dilmun, or Telmun civilization, linking Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley together through trade. But following the rise of Islam, the island was fought over and controlled by a number of different civilizations. Fort Arad was built by the Bedouin dynasty known as the Jabrids to help fortify the island after they took control in the mid-1400’s. Alas, the fortress did not live up to its purpose as the Portuguese handily invaded and seized Bahrain in 1521, killing the Jabrid’s ruler in the process, and controlling the much coveted island for nearly a century until they were defeated by Persia. Over the next few centuries Arad Fort became an area of much fighting in Bahrain, usually whenever the island was attacked by marauders or changed hands through use of force. It was not until 1820, that the Al Khalifa family were installed as the royal monarchy by Britain, and still make up much of the current government of modern day Bahrain. In 1980 the fort was restored with the same materials used during its original construction. There are really no restrictions on where you can go or what you can touch, making the fort a fun place to hop around and a great interactive experience, especially for a family with energetic little minions. Comfortable shoes are a must if one wants to climb about on the ramparts. Located in Muharraq, just South of Bahrain International Airport",fortresses forts architectural oddities architecture

224,Barbar Temple,"Barbar, Bahrain","This archaeological site boasts temple ruins that date back 5,000 years to the Dilmun culture, an may have been described in the tale of Gilgamesh's search for immortality.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/barbar-temple,"Despite the historical significance of this site, it has very few visitors, and is secured by a single guard who is very happy to tell you all he knows of the site. The Barbar Temple is actually three Dilmun temples, built on top of each other, starting in the third millennium B.C. (For context, the Egyptian Pyramids at Giza started construction in the middle of the second millennium B.C.). Temple 2 was built approximately 500 years after Temple 1, and Temple 3 was built in approximately 2100-2000 B.C. From a central terrace, a stairway leads to a shrine for water cult ceremonies; the spring of sweet water filled the pool at least through the 1950s, as you can see in photos in the small museum on site. This spring was likely a reason for the location of the shrine. Originally uncovered and excavated by Danish archaeologists Glob, Andersen, and Mortensen in the 1950s, most of the finds—which include a copper bull’s head, tools, weapons, and pottery—are on display in the Bahrain National Museum. Approximately four millenia ago, a poem written in cuneiform on a clay tablet in ancient Sumer described Dilmun: The Land of Dilmun is holy, / The Land of Dilmun is pure. / In Dilmun no cry the raven utters, nor does the bird of ill-omen foretell calamity. / The lion kills not, / Nor does the ravening wolf snatch away the defenseless lamb. / Unknown is the wild dog who tears the kid. / The dove does not conceal its head. / No one here says “my eyes are sick.” No one here says “my head is sick.” No one here says “I am an old woman.” No one here says “I am an old man.” The maiden walks here in innocence. No lustrations need to be poured. / The somber death priest walks not here. By Dilmun’s walls he has no cause for lamentations. Could the basis of this Sumerian poem be why Gilgamesh, hero of the earliest surviving notable literature in human history, possibly actually ruling the Sumerian city of Uruk sometime between 2900-2350, traveled to Dilmun to seek immortality? As Bahrain is only approximately 15 miles by 30 miles, the majority of Dilmun ruins are in the northern governorate, and the capital of the Dilmun civilization was likely housed at the Qala’a Bahrain (Bahrain Fort) nearby to the temple. If Gilgamesh did travel to Dilmun, he probably walked the same ground you will at this temple site.  Note that Google Maps and Waze will send you past the parking lot and you may have to turn around.",artifacts temples archaeology ruins history & culture
