It is one of the world’s biodiveristy hotspots, meaning that it’s especially rich in endemic species, or those found nowhere else in the world. The Parc Zoologique et Forestier Michel Corbasson (Zoological and Forest Park) in Nouméa is the perfect place to get a feel for the endemic flora and fauna of this island nation in the South Pacific. Enjoy a stroll through the endemic species section of the park to get up close and personal with New Caledonian crows, giant geckos, goliath imperial pigeons and the flightless kagu. Walking through the kagu enclosure is a special experience—the birds are curious and will follow visitors around the boardwalk, carefully inspecting them. Many of the animal enclosures also list feeding times, giving you a chance to see park staff interact with the animals, and talk about the animals and their plight (many are endangered). The park has trails catering to a variety of interests including a quiet walk through a native forest where, if you’re lucky, you’ll see colorful birds and butterflies.  There is a small café at the entrance to the park where you can purchase a variety of sandwiches and salads to enjoy on the picnic benches amongst the peacocks. Make sure to bring cash as credit cards aren’t accepted at either the café or park entrance.",endangered animals zoos animals
1,Jean Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center,"Nouméa, New Caledonia",Marvel of green building techniques that sings with the wind.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jean-marie-tjibaou-cultural-center,"Designed by Renzo Piano and opened in 1998, the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center (Centre Culturel Tjibaou) was built to mimic the villages of the local Kanak people. It is named in honor of Jean-Marie Tjibaou, who died in 1989 while leading a fight for freedom from the French government, and dedicated to exploring the culture of New Caledonia and the South Pacific. Although a wonder of modern architecture and green building innovations, it is also deeply connected with the area, from its exterior of local iroko wood to its utilization of traditional building techniques. The building was designed to “sing” as it vibrates with the strong ocean winds, which are also allowed through the building as natural ventilation, so that the center is not just in harmony with nature, but a part of it. The double layered exterior forces warm air up and out of the building. It was also created to be stable in violent winds and earthquakes. The huts of the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center contain a center for art, a museum, theatres, and a library.",sounds architectural oddities architecture
2,Sentir de la Petite Cascade de Farino,"Farino, New Caledonia",This peaceful path through the jungle is surrounded by songbirds and complete with a waterfall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sentir-de-la-petite-cascade-de-farino,"This amazing trail is just a short walk from the parking area. Intrepid explorers can venture down this jungle pathway until they reach the waterfall at the path’s end. Located in the middle of the rainforest, the falls and trail are just a short drive from the administrative office of Farino. It’s a beautiful ride that offers some of the most amazing views of the island’s west coast. The more the 2- mile walk (3.6km round-trip) is an easy trek along a well-marked path. The path takes you deep into the rainforest and along the creek that flows from the bottom of the falls. It’s easy to spot a few of New Caledonia’s endemic bird species and lizards along the path.  The parking lot from where you begin the hike is located at Le Refuge de Farino (a campground with tent spaces and cabins). There are signs along the way from Farino pointing you in this direction.",rainforest fauna trails animals
3,Bonhomme de Bourail,"Bourail, New Caledonia",A beachside monolith shaped by years of waves crashing against hard quartz.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bonhomme-de-bourail,"The Bonhomme de Bourail is a striking rock formation, a monolith made of quartz, that protrudes from the sea on the south end of the Baie des Tortues (Turtle Bay). The rock formation’s name translates to “Gentleman of Bourail,” and was named for its resemblance to a man’s head with a hat on. Years of waves crashing upon this rock led to its unusual shape. But despite the durability of its material, the structure is surprisingly fragile. Another rock formation—La Roche Percée (The Pierced Rock), named for a hole in its base—could once be found nearby, but after a series of landslides, was destroyed in 2007. The lagoons surrounding New Caledonia are recognized for their outstanding biodiversity including corals, turtles, dugongs and whales. The exceptional importance of this region, including the Bourail Lagoon, has been recognized through its designation as a UNESCO world heritage site. The beach at Turtle Bay is in the center of three beaches with the Baie des Amoureaux (Bay of Lovers) to the northwest and the Plage de la Roche Percee (Roche Percee Beach) to the southeast. The Bonhomme de Bourail can be seen from a number of vantage points, including spots on the network of hiking trails which connect the three beaches. Turtle Bay is the perfect place to spend a relaxing day, or take advantage of the only surfing spot in New Caledonia with waves reaching up to 2.5 meters (8 feet). The beach is beautifully nestled in the forest covered hillside and is separated from the small parking area by a swath of New Caledonian pines. Turtle Bay a special place not only for its natural beauty, but also for the significance it has to the local indigenous populations, for whom this place is an important gateway to the kingdom of the dead.",rock formations beaches rocks geological oddities natural wonders geology nature
4,Monument de Balade,"Balade, New Caledonia",An overgrown monument remembers 60 years of French control in New Caledonia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-de-balade,"This monument was erected in 1913 to mark 60 years since the French violently took possession of New Caledonia in 1853. Erected with much fanfare, the large pyramid-shaped monument sits atop a stone base on top of a small hill. Today, more than a hundred years later, the monument has fallen into obscurity. An overgrown path leads to the monument and the area where the monument sits is also overgrown with knee-high grasses. Today, few visit the area. Located on the far northeastern corner of Grande Terre, the largest island of New Caledonia, a few miles from the village of Balade along the RPN7 main road. The monument is easy to reach, as long as you know where to look. Adding to the difficulty of finding this monument is (1) it is not shown in Google Maps and (2) the sign at the nearby road marking the spot is easy to miss, because it is small and nearly overgrown.  The monument can be found at: -20.297345, 164.474412 It is located along the RPN7, just north of the road, about 2 miles (3 km) west of the Balade church, and about a third of a mile (600 meters) west of the turnoff to Maamaat beach. Search maps for ""Maamaat"". In maps, look for a small trail west of the Maamaat beach turnoff shaped like a circle. The monument is in the middle of that circle.",beach hiking trails colonialism hidden monuments
5,Hobbiton,"Matamata, New Zealand","The real life Hobbiton, this sheep farm has been forever transformed since being built for The Hobbit film series.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/real-life-shire-hobbiton,"Once an unassuming farm, this hillside will never be seen the same way again after being chosen to act as a set for “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” films. Even before it was retrofitted with several Hobbit Holes to play the part of Hobbiton in Peter Jackson’s adaptations of the classic Tolkien book series, this sheep farm seemed like a perfect stand-in for the famous fictional “Shire,” home of hobbits everywhere. Indeed, its natural likeness is undoubtedly the reason Jackson and his producers chose the location—with the only other qualification being that it’s located in New Zealand, the unofficial real-life location of Tolkien’s Middle Earth. In September 1998, Sir Peter Jackson “discovered” the Alexander Farm during an aerial search for suitable film sites. Site construction started in March 1999. Filming The Lord of the Rings trilogy commenced in 1999 and lasted for three months. When the site was rebuilt for The Hobbit trilogy in 2009, these structures were built out of permanent materials. The entire reconstruction process took two years, yet filming The Hobbit trilogy began in October 2011 and took only 12 days. At its peak, 400 people were on-site, including Sir Peter Jackson, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Bilbo Baggins, and young Bilbo Baggins. The farm is still an active sheep farm, but visitors can tour the area used for the set. Most of the Hobbit Holes are fenced off and you can’t enter them, but one is specifically designed for visitors to enter and explore. Tour guides are employed to explain where in the movies each area appears – Bag End is a highlight, along with The Green Dragon, a whimsical old-world pub. In fact, The Green Dragon is now open for business, and at the end of the tour, you can have a drink there. The set is very detailed and the hobbit holes are purposely made to look as though they have been there for years, complete with details like fake moss and many other small touches. There is laundry hanging, food displayed, salmon being smoked and other fish caught mimicking a very realistic set. The tree at Bag End is a fake tree intended to preserve the area’s appearance as it was in the film, even though the one featured in The Lord of the Rings was real. The film version was actually cut down and placed there for the movie. It died by the time they decided to film The Hobbit, so a fake tree with hand-painted leaves sits in its place, an exact replica of the original. The gorgeous location makes it easy to see why this was chosen for The Shire. The farm is in the middle of the countryside, still seemingly hidden from the modern world. A GPS is helpful in locating it since there aren’t really any signs directing you where to go.  Tours depart from 3 sites: The Shire’s Rest, Matamata i-SITE, and Rotorua. The Hobbiton tour includes walking through the Party Tree, the Party Field, Bilbo Baggins’ hobbit, Bag End, the Watermill, and finally finishing at The Green Dragon (a cafe), a complimentary cider, all handcrafted and exclusive to Hobbiton Movie Set, will be served. It’s 111 miles from Auckland to Hobbiton. Almost everyone that visits New Zealand rents a car or a motor home to explore. Given this, you do not need to organize your tour with a third-party service unless you need transportation to The Hobbiton Movie Set. In short, buy tickets directly from The Hobbiton Movie Set and drive to the location. Once you arrive, it’s private property, and then you do need to take a tour. You cannot get to The Hobbiton Movie Set yourself, nor can you see it from a distance. You must take the bus included in your ticket. Make sure that you purchase tickets in advance.

6,Waitomo Glowworm Caves,"Waitomo, New Zealand",Tubing through a cave lit with glowworms is a magical underground experience.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/waitomo-glowworm-caves,"In 1887, English surveyor Fred Mace and local Maori Chief Tane Tinorau decided to explore the Caves of Waitomo. They entered the cave system on a tiny raft where a stream descends into the underground, and with their candles, they carefully navigated the stream through the caves. In the darkness, they noticed starlike lights scattered across the formations above their heads. Thousands of glowworms were hanging peacefully above their heads, forming a magnificent bioluminescent cosmos. The glowworm is a catch-all name for the bioluminescent larvae of various species. The larvae of the beetle fireflies (Lampyridae), beetle larvae (Phengodidae), and of Arachnocampa, a type of fungus gnat all bioluminescence. It is these fungus gnats that can be found in massive numbers in Waitomo caves. The fungus gnat larvae cling to rock walls and hunt with long strings of sticky mucus. When seen in large groups they are truly astounding. Elated with joy, the two men would return many times to explore further. On an independent trip, Tinorau found a land entrance, which is the same entrance that is used today by tourists from around the world. Tourists started visiting in 1889 when Tinorau and his wife began leading tours. Today, many cave guides are descendants of Tinorau and his wife, and the fungus gnats, with their long strings of sticky mucus, still glow beautifully.   You can buy single tickets for any of the caves, or you can buy a bundle. I strongly recommend you buy a package and see them all. Not only is this a more economical option, but all of the caves are worth seeing. It costs ~ 97ND to tour all three caves. All tickets include tours of the caves. You cannot self navigate the tours. Reservations are required, and numbers on each tour are restricted.",bioluminescence caves ecosystems animals
7,Milford Sound,"Milford Sound, New Zealand","Dolphins, ancient clams and hundreds of waterfalls make this one of the world's top tourist destinations.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/milford-sound,"Off the coast of New Zealand, in the Tasman Sea, huge granite cliffs rise 3,900 feet or more, and plunge 300-1500 feet under the surface of the water. These mountainous structures, carved by ancient glaciers, are the fjords of the Milford Sound. Milford Sound is home to some of the world’s most unique flora and fauna. Ancient clams called brachiopods are buried under the floor of the fjord, and have had no need to evolve for over 300 million years. The world’s largest population of black coral trees also lives under the surface. Related to sea anemones, the coral colonies’ lifespans are over 4000 years and they are among the oldest continuously living organisms on the planet. There are approximately seven million of the colonies in Milford Sound. Black coral trees can be seen through the Milford Discovery Centre and Underwater Observatory. Dolphins, New Zealand Fur Seals, and Fjordland Crested Penguins also frequent the waters. Lucky visitors will see the occasional whale that wanders into the fiord from the Tasman Sea. Dolphins swim alongside the Milford Sound Cruise Ships and show off for their guests. Groups of penguins pop in and out of the water, while the fur seals rest on the low rocks. The fjord gets over 20 feet of rainfall every year, feeding its two permanent waterfalls. Good weather is a bit of a long shot, but rains only serve to create hundreds of temporary waterfalls that sporadically appear on every cliff. If the sun does decide to peek out of the clouds, expect a rainbow at the bottom of every misty waterfall. Milford Sound is New Zealand’s most popular fjord, because it is the only one that can be reached by car. Milford Road is a steep five hour drive from Queenstown, but the determined traveller will find that the stunning scenery and Lord of the Rings landmarks make the journey as delightful as the destination.   The journey to Milford Sound will take at least 12 hours, including travel time and sightseeing. The best way to see the wildlife and take in the scenery is by taking the 1 ½-2 hour cruise through 16km of fiord. Kayaking is also a good way to get up close and personal to the wildlife. For more extreme visitors, there is scuba diving, base jumping, and mountain climbing. The only accommodation in Milford Sound is at the Milford Lodge.",fjords dolphins fauna flora waterfalls water plants nature animals
8,Castle Hill,"Castle Hill, New Zealand","The Dalai Lama named this New Zealand landscape the ""Spiritual Center of the Universe.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spiritual-center-of-the-universe,"New Zealand is known for its natural beauty, but in 2002 a particular patch of farmland was given a special honor. It became a “Spiritual Center of the Universe.” Called Castle Hill, the area is a high country station—a station is a large farm area dedicated to the grazing of sheep and cattle—on New Zealand’s South Island. Looking like the ruins of a castle, and hence the name, the hill is a popular climbing and bouldering spot for rock climbers. But rock climbers aren’t the only ones impressed by the site. In 2002, the Dalai Lama visited the South Island. Apparently, he didn’t like the energy in the nearby town of Christchurch (whose church is made from rock quarried from the boulders) and he was taken to the boulder field. He was so taken by the landscape, and his spiritual experience there he named the area a “Spiritual Center of the Universe.” The area got some world exposure when the nearby Flock Hill station was used for the filming of the climactic battle scenes of the 2005 movie The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.  The hill is located at an altitude of 700 metres, close to State Highway 73 between Darfield and Arthur's Pass. It is on private property.",geological oddities natural wonders geology nature
9,That Wanaka Tree,"Wanaka, New Zealand","A solitary tree has grown up all alone on Lake Wānaka, backdropped by the beautiful Southern Alps.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lone-tree-of-lake-wanaka,"Framed by the South Island’s stunning Southern Alps, a lonely tree has grown up to spread its wings just off shore at the south end of Lake Wānaka. Known as the “lone tree of Lake Wānaka,” it is said to be one of the most photographed trees in all New Zealand. However, you still need to have the inside scoop to find it, as there are no signs directing people to the solitary tree. It’s just enough off of the beaten path to not be bothered by too many tourists unless they’ve done their research. Walking along the lake to find the lone tree is a beautiful sight. When you arrive, you’ll find beach access on the shore just a stone’s throw away from the tree, the perfect place to have a picnic and watch the sun set or rise. If you can stand the cold but refreshing water of Lake Wānaka, swimming is a great way to awaken the senses. The lone tree is right at the foothills of Mount Aspiring National Park, a World Heritage Site, acting as a doorway into even more of the breathtaking landscapes that embody the South Island of New Zealand. Try visiting when the sun is low on the horizon and there’s an abundance of colorful low light, rather than the view being bleached out by the midday sun. At this time of day you’re also more likely to find the lone tree of Lake Wānaka, all alone.  The easiest way to access this iconic tree is via a car park located just a two minute walk away. This car park is found at the start of the Waterfall Creek Track.",lakes trees water plants
10,The Tree Church,"Ohaupo, New Zealand",One man's dream has turned into this naturally growing chapel made of almost nothing but trees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tree-church-ohaupo-new-zealand,"Many people see the face of God in the beauty of nature, but few have ever taken this to the extent of Barry Cox, the infinitely patient creator of New Zealand’s Tree Church. According to his website, Cox has long appreciated the beauty of churches he has seen across the world during his travels, and finally decided to create one of his own. Cox runs a service that safely uproots trees using a truck mounted scoop called a “tree spade,” and replants them elsewhere. Using his preexisting equipment and know-how, Cox began planting a variety of trees on his land to form portions of the church, each chosen for a different quality. For instance, the walls were planted with leptospernums for their color, and the roof was created using cut leaf alders for their sparse canopy that would allow the natural light into the space. The project began in 2011, and the planted trees were delicately trained across an iron frame until they began to grow together to shape the gabled form of the church. The church has continued to grow over the years and is now almost completely formed, although the iron frame remains, waiting for the day when the structure will be sturdy enough to stand on its own. Today the Tree Church is open for weddings and events, and can seat up to a hundred guests. Cox’s grounds also include green garden walks and a medieval-style labyrinth. Outdoor weddings are always a gamble, but at least this one provides a roof either way.  The Tree Church is open to the public on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Groups and private events are arranged by appointment only.

11,Devil's Bath,"Waiotapu, New Zealand",This electric green sulphur lake in New Zealand looks like a cartoonish radioactive dump site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devil-s-bath,"The Wai-O-Tapu Wonderland in New Zealand is home to a number of roiling, bubbling geothermal sights, but possibly the most intriguing is one of its most calm. Known as the Devil’s Bath, this neon green pool of stagnant stink water is a natural wonder. Between geysers and colorfully steaming mud bogs, the Wai-O-Tapu volcanic era offers no shortage of wondrous attractions. The Devil’s Bath may not have as many active reactions as other features in the vicinity, but it is still the most eye-catching (and the most intriguingly named). The pool sits in a slight depression likely created from a massive eruption from underground. It is well out of reach of visiting gawkers but can be seen clearly from above. The bright green water gets its color from deposits of sulphur that rise to the surface and float on top. The green identifies that active mineral while other hues found across the park such as blues, reds, and otherwise signify other volcanic elements. The origin of the demonic monicker is unknown, but given how unnatural the pool looks, it would almost come as no surprise to see Satan himself rise from the still lake. Despite the name and almost frightening display of geothermal chemistry, the Devil’s Bath and all of the volcanic craziness in the area are a favorite attraction for traveling families looking to show their kids how bizarre and unnatural nature can look.",geological oddities natural wonders geology nature

John, on the South Island of New Zealand. The color of the lake’s water truly sets it apart from other lakes. It’s a beautiful turquoise blue is a product of the surrounding glaciers. The glaciers in the headwaters of Lake Tekapo grind rocks into a fine dust on their journey down towards the lake. The resulting particulate, called “rock flour,” is suspended in the water and causes the magnificent turquoise. The amazing color of the lake set against the backdrop of snow-capped peaks and fields of wildflowers makes Lake Tekapo an extraordinarily dramatic landscape. The best views can be had from the top of Mt. John, which is home to University of Canterbury’s Mt. John Observatory.

Commissioned by local politician, John Cargill, son of Captain William Cargill, in the 1870s, the tunnel is the primary draw, but not the only draw, of the area, which is also known for the beauty of its rugged sandstone cliffs, rock arches, and caves. To reach the beach today, visitors must trek across private farmland. The path, which was opened in 1983, descends from about 500 feet above sea level and is located just a short distance from Blackhead Road. The path winds its way to the top of the tunnel, which then leads guests down 72 steps to the beach. The tunnel is a bit spooky. Naturally lit, the tunnel is quite dark and if you speak at a low enough pitch while inside of it, it resonates loudly from one end to the other. From SH1, South Dunedin, follow the Southern Scenic Route sign to Blackhead Road. Turn on to Green Island Bush Road and stop at the carpark.

Along with its neighbor Franz Josef Glacier, it’s one of the world’s most accessible glaciers for exploring, and regular guided tours are available. The glacier has been advancing since 1985 after decades of retreating, and with all the movement and melting stunning ice caves have been revealed. However, gorgeous as it is, solo wandering is not allowed as there is a danger of ice breaks and rockfalls that in the past have proved fatal. You must take a tour; you can not access it without either flying on a plane that can land on ice or land with helicopter. The hike to the viewing point is easy and it's still impressive.

The horizontal visibility of the water in the area has been measured at an average of 63 meters, which is a world record for fresh water. This value, verified using specialist optical instruments, approaches the theoretical maximum for optically pure water. The springs are notable for the volume of water discharged from the eight main vents, ranking among the largest in the world. It is estimated that 14,000 liters of water are produced per second, approximately enough to fill 40 bathtubs. In a 1974 television documentary, it was noted that this would be enough water to supply a city the size of Boston, Massachusetts. The floor of the lake is covered with white sand. Waters expelled from some of the smaller vents carry the sand upward. These vents are known as the dancing sands, which for the few scuba divers who have secured permission to dive in the springs, is one of the highlights of underwater sightseeing. At the entrance to the walkway to the springs, the Department of Conservation in New Zealand has placed a sign: “Te Waikoropupu Springs are a taonga (treasure) and waahi tapu (a sacred place) for Māori, both locally and nationally. The legends of Te Waikoropupu are told in the stories of Huriawa, its taniwha (guardian spirit). In Māori tradition the Springs are wairou, the purest form of water which is the wairua (spiritual) and the physical source of life. The Springs provide water for healing, and in the past were a place of ceremonial blessings at times of birth and death and the leaving and returning of travelers.”  Head out of west out of Takaka and you will the sign.

16,Gibbs Farm,"Makarau, New Zealand",A gigantic sculpture garden is packed with innovative oddities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gibbs-farm,"In 1991, entrepreneur and art collector Alan Gibbs purchased a piece of property on New Zealand’s North Island that has now come to be known as Gibbs Farm. Immediately following his purchase, Gibbs knew that the property would eventually grow to become the world’s ultimate meeting place of giant sculptures and rolling farmland. Over the past 25 years, Gibbs has hired 22 renowned sculptors from around the world to construct towering abstract sculptures atop the rolling hills of the 1,000-acre plot. Every month, the farm is open to the public for one day, in which visitors will have the ultimate chance to witness the unique adaptation of innovative sculptures to an outdoor environment. Perhaps one of the most famous sculptures on Gibbs Farm is Neil Dawson’s “Horizons,” which resembles a giant piece of corrugated iron atop a hill. While it may appear to be a computer-generated cartoon, astoundingly, Horizons is a real sculpture made of welded and painted steel, and it fits in perfectly with the cow-filled agricultural landscape of the farm. Also found on Gibbs Farm is Sol LeWitt’s “Pyramid,” a cluster of concrete blocks that form a perfect staircase for the sheep of the property. Anish Kapoor’s “Dismemberment” sculpture is a humungous tube with open ends on both sides, nestled in a slight dip in the farm’s rolling hills. Perhaps one of the most ingenious creations found at Gibbs Farm is the Electrum, the world’s largest Tesla coil, standing at four stories tall. On a leisurely walk through Gibbs Farm, visitors will be treated to an array of multi-story paper clips, a forest of 100 giant vertical lights, a bridge made out of cubes, a field of multi-colored squares, and even a life-sized, incredibly-realistic giraffe. Although Gibbs Farm is rarely open to the public and is little-known worldwide, it is truly one of New Zealand’s best-kept secret gems.",electricity sculpture gardens farms sculptures art

New Zealand’s largest volcanic eruption killed over 100 people and created an entirely new landscape of steaming fumaroles, boiling mud, and deadly hot springs all inside the new caldera. The village of Te Wairoa was established in 1848 by Christian missionaries as a model village. Sixty years after the eruption of Tarawera, the Smith family purchased the land and began excavating, looking for the remains of the lost village Today visitors can explore the 12-acre site including the excavated village, museum, and a reconstruction of a pioneer era cottage.

Cold winds tear through the air, battering the land and all that grows upon it. The weather is so fierce that the whipping winds have left a patch of trees weirdly warped. The tangled trees stretch sideways rather than upwards. They’re bent at odd angles, their branches permanently coiffed to the side like a permanent, ill-advised hairdo. Sheep farmers planted the trees to give their flocks shelter from the wild weather. Cold air whirls around the Antarctic Ocean uninterrupted, causing the winds to gain immense strength before hurling themselves at whatever objects they first encounter. The trees struggled to bear the brunt of the windy assault, causing them to bend northward. On a pleasant day, beams of sunlight spotlight the gnarled knot, giving it the appearance of a surreal piece of art. Against the ominous gray skies of a drearier visit, the mangled mass seems almost sinister. Slope Point is a beautiful place to explore. Green pastureland stretches toward the horizon, leading to the rocky cliffs that plunge into the water below. The place is sparsely habitated, apart from the sheep that dot the landscape.

Only there, once you’ve descended deep into the belly of the cave passage, will you find the galaxy of glowworms dangling from the ceiling.  The Waipu caves are unregulated and unguided, which means visitors are responsible for their own safety (check the weather a week before going and never explore alone). The caves are wet and slippery, and sometimes you'll need to wade through water up to waist-height. The inner chambers are suitable for experienced cavers only. Sinkholes are common and correct footwear and a head torch are necessary. Turn off all lights to make the most of the glow worms. Please respect the local area and take all rubbish home with you. There is a shower and toilets in the car park near the caves to clean your gear (and yourself, if you wish).",glowing bioluminescence bug insects underground subterranean sites caves ecosystems
20,Electrum,"Kaukapakapa, New Zealand",One of the world's largest Tesla coils.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/electrum,"Tesla coils have always played a special role in denoting the “mad” scientist. Created by that great icon of mad science himself, Nikola Tesla, the coils have long been beloved by high-voltage hobbyists. One of the world’s largest Tesla coil, however, was commissioned neither as a work of science nor as a movie prop, but as a work of art. Known as Electrum, this four-story (38-foot) Tesla coil was commissioned by a prominent New Zealand art patron, Alan Gibbs, and set up on his farm outside of Auckland in April of 1998. Built by the late artist Eric Orr and high-voltage engineer Greg Leyh, the enormous coil puts out over 3 million volts, enough to rip electrons out of the air molecules around it. A particular delight of Electrum is the hollow spherical cage on top of it, where Greg Leyh often sits during discharge shows. The arcs from the coil would instantly kill anyone they struck, but Leyh is safe within the Faraday cage created by the sphere. Of course, if he were to put his hand in the cage, he would be instantly electrocuted. Though Electrum is the largest coil currently in existence, it is not the biggest ever created. That title belongs to an 18-story coil built-in 1903 by Nikola Tesla himself at Wardenclyffe on Long Island. Unfortunately, it was torn down due to a lack of funding before it was ever fully operational. But Leyh, the co-creator of Electrum, has plans to resurrect Tesla’s dream of a giant coil — times two. Under the project name “Lightning on Demand,” or LOD, Leyh has purchased 81 acres in the Nevada desert where he plans to build twin 118-foot-tall Tesla coils, which would be big enough to generate 10-million-volt lightning arcs that would stretch across an area the size of a football field. Having built a pair of 1:12 scale (still almost 10 feet tall) coils as a proof of concept, Leyh is waiting for funding to help bring his electrical dream to life. Other large Tesla coils currently in action include the Viziv tower in Milford, Texas, “BIGGG” Tesla coil in Oklahoma, Big Bruiser in Wisconsin, and a pair of coils known as CAUAC that make an appearance at the annual Coachella music festival. A number of large coils can also be seen at the yearly Teslathon gatherings.  Check Gibbs Farm website for visitor dates.

Together with the “pancake” layering of the limestone — created by immense pressure on alternating hard and soft layers of marine creatures and plant sediments — it makes for a very strange and beautiful environment. The coastal promontory of the Pancake Rocks is looped by an easy walking track — 15 minutes, or as long as you want to take to stare into the fascinating surge pool at the point (known as the Devil’s Cauldron), catch the blowholes in action, or enjoy the sweeping views down the Paparoa National Park coastline. Time your visit to coincide with High tide. It is interesting to look at when the tide is out but the insane display of the blowholes only happens around high tide.

22,Kapiti Island Nature Reserve,New Zealand,Only 68 people per day are allowed to visit this New Zealand bird-watcher’s paradise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kapiti-island-nature-reserve,"An hour’s drive north of Wellington is the Kapiti Coast from which nature enthusiasts can get tours to the island nature reserve that lies across the Rauoterangi channel. Kapiti Island is one of New Zealand’s celebrated conservation success stories since invasive predators have been fully eradicated allowing rare bird species to thrive. Limited access helps maintain the pristine environment, but humans have lived on the island for nearly 800 years. The Maori call the island Te Waewae-Kapiti-o-Tara-raua-ko-Rangitane and began settling there in the 18th century, around the same time that Captain Cook visited in 1770. During the 19th century, more than 2,000 people employed by the whaling industry occupied the island and some of the blubber pots they used can still be seen on the island. The island was also was also the center of the middle New Zealand empire ruled by chief Te Rauparaha from the 1830s to the 1860s. Today, the oldest building on the island is the Whare Tawhito, built in 1897 when the government purchased the island to restore New Zealand’s natural heritage. It was once the home of the world’s first state-sponsored conservation officer, Richard Henry, and today it is the first stop for visitors where they receive instructions about exploring the island. Following the elimination of rats, cats, possums, sheep, dogs, and mustelids, the island’s rare bird population has flourished.  One of the great success stories is the thriving population of 1,200 little-spotted kiwis which are extinct on the North and South islands, but which were brought back from the brink when five birds were transplanted to Kapiti in 1912. Other species for which lucky twitchers should be on the lookout include kakariki (red-crowned parakeet) and the kaka, a medium sized parrot and close relative of the famous kea and kakapo.  Although the omnivorous weka, a flightless rail, also lives on the island, it has not posed a threat to more endangered species, and its cousin the takahe has also done well on Kapiti now boasting a nationwide population of 347. Visitors to Kapiti Island will no doubt be amazed by New Zealand’s natural splendor, even if this island is truly for the birds.  Visiting the island must be done through one of two approved tour companies, Kapiti Island Eco Experience, or Kapiti Island Nature Tours.",birds animals
23,Rotorua,"Rotorua, New Zealand",Major tourist destination known for its bubbling mud-pools and hot thermal springs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rotorua-1,"New Zealanders like to refer to their land as “God’s Own Country,” a land of plenty with beautiful scenery and a temperate climate. But located 230 km south of Auckland lies a city that bears more resemblance to the “fiery deluge, fed with ever-burning sulfur unconsumed” from John Milton’s epic poem “Paradise Lost.” A city on the shore of a lake with the same name, Rotorua, is known worldwide for its geothermal activity and geysers. Rotorua’s tourism industry is the largest in the area; the city is a major destination for domestic and international travelers. Rotorua, also known as “Sulphur City,” was first settled by the Maori people around 1325 CE. They used the pools at Whakarewarewa for cooking and heating. The hellish landscape contains around 500 pools and seven active geysers, the most active of which, Pohutu (“Big Splash”), can erupt to a height of 30 meters. The thermal activity in the town comes from the Rotorua caldera. It results in bubbling mud pools and hot thermal springs. The Buried Village, an area covered by the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption, is another popular destination, as are the botanical gardens. The area first became popular with tourists in the late 19th century when people came to the area to relax in the town’s bathhouse, now the Museum of Art and History. The hot thermal springs must be incredibly attractive as the visitors keep coming despite a frequent rotten egg smell that overtakes the city. There are many things to do in Rotorua, including taking a lesson about the Maoris in Whakarewarewa; visiting the Living Maori Village; soaking in the iconic thermal springs at Polynesian Spa; visiting the mud bath at Hell’s Gate, and learning all about New Zealand’s unique hydrothermal and volcanic environment at the Waimangu Volcanic Valley.  Rotorua is served by State Highways 5, 30, and 30A, and the Thermal Explorer Highway touring route, with State Highways 33 and 36 terminating on the outskirts of the city.",fiery wonders martian landscapes natural wonders ecosystems nature
24,Baldwin Street Houses,"Dunedin, New Zealand",One of the world's steepest streets seems to have houses sliding down it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baldwin-street-houses,"Thanks to some blunt city planning Dunedin, New Zealand’s residential Baldwin Street has become known as one of the world’s steepest roads, and it certainly seems like if there were a street that was any steeper, it would be a wall. When the city of Dunedin was first planned, it was done so by urban designers back in London who simply slapped an orderly grid system atop the map with no consideration of the actual topography. This resulted in a number of streets that landed right on extremely steep hills. Rather than scale down the steepness, the roads were simply built at a staggeringly steep grade. Baldwin Street ended up being the most extreme victim of this remote city planning, earning it the Guinness World Record for the steepest street in the world for many years. In July 2019, the world record title was granted to Ffordd Pen Llech in Harlech, Wales, leaving Baldwin Street in second place. The street seems to take a good deal of pride in its reputation. Each year, multiple charity events are held on the street including a fun run to promote fitness where people run up and then down the shockingly laborious thousand-some feet of the street and an even weirder event where spherical, red-coated chocolate candies bounce down the street in a distance race.",world record urban planning roads houses homes
25,Putangirua Pinnacles,"Cape Palliser, New Zealand",These phallic stone spires once served as Tolkien's Paths of the Dead.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/putangirua-pinnacles,"Enormous stone pillars of ancient gravel occupy a valley near the southernmost point of New Zealand’s North Island. They have fascinated locals since time immemorial. Over the past seven to nine million years, the forces of wind, rain, and floods eroded these curious geological formations into an impressive collection of tall spires. Each pinnacle (or “hoodoo”) is capped by a cemented layer of silt and rock, protecting the gravel directly below but allowing erosion to take place around it. Some even feature “fluting,” or long vertical ridges running down their sides caused by rainwater during particularly violent storms. All together, the effect is that of a number of separate stone rods having been grouped together, although the caps do make them look surprisingly phallic. The Pinnacles have long been a favorite nature spot, but they achieved true fame when they were featured in the third Lord of the Rings film, Return of the King. The looming pillars rise up around Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli while they walk the Paths of the Dead, before actually meeting the Dead Men of Dunharrow. As one of the best examples of badlands erosion in the world, the Putangirua Pinnacles are a must-see for any geology geek, as well as any Tolkien geek.

Still more than 12 km long, it descends to less than 300 meters above sea level, in the middle of a tropical forest. Along with nearby Fox Glacier, they’re the only two glacial formations on Earth that coexist with tropical plantlife. According to Maori legend, Franz Josef was formed when a local woman named Hineukatere brought her lover Wawe climbing up Mt. Cook; when he fell to his death in an avalanche, Hineukatere’s tears froze into the glacier, giving it the Maori name (Ka Roimata O Hinehukatere, the Tears of Hinehukatere). Westerners renamed it in honor of the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef in 1865. Franz Josef is one of the most volatile glaciers, occasionally seeing flow rates up to 70 cm per day (that’s about ten times the average). It’s been in a very rapid retreat since 2008, and worsening conditions on the terminal face have forced the closure of the glacier walk entrance; currently the only way onto the glacier itself is via helicopter tour. Coming from Franz Josef Glacier township, the access road is a left just across the Waiho River bridge on Route 6.",natural wonders water nature

The crew was fishing with baited hooks, and unexpectedly they caught a 500 kg colossal squid that was nibbling on an Antarctic toothfish (the staple diet of this species which inhabits the Southern Ocean). The squid was barely alive and close to death, so they brought it into the freezer of the ship as a specimen. The colossal squid is now believed to be the largest squid species in the world. Larger and heavier than a giant squid, equipped with limbs covered in teeth and hooks, a gigantic razor sharp beak , and the largest eyes in the world (10 inches across, the size of soccer balls), the colossal squid goes to show that “sea monsters” may exist after all.",giant squid natural history museums world's largest taxidermy collections water animals museums

The disaster was extensive: villages were destroyed, more than one hundred people were killed, and the island’s famed Pink and White Terraces disappeared beneath the waters of Lake Rotomahana. Out of the destruction came the formation of the area now known as Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley, and one of the world’s largest hot springs. The simply-named Frying Pan Lake occupies 38,000 square meters in part of the volcanic crater. The shallow waters average a deadly 110-130 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of the lake is only about 18 feet deep, but at vents parts of it plunge down to 60 feet. Some sources claim that Frying Pan Lake is the largest hot spring in the world, while others favor Boiling Lake in Dominica, Lesser Antilles; Glenwood Springs in Colorado; or the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park.",hot springs martian landscapes natural wonders ecosystems water nature

This strange boulder makes for an unusual beach attraction. Known as Split Apple Rock, the naturally occurring rock formation is located just off the coast between Kaiteriteri and Marahau in Abel Tasman National Park. It’s made of granite and estimated to be around 120 million years old. According to Māori legend, the boulder was split by two feuding gods who were fighting to possess it. To resolve the issue, they used their huge godlike strength to break it in half. As such, the Māori name for the rock is Tokangawhā, which means “burst open rock.” A more scientific theory is that water seeped into a crevice in the rock and then froze during an ice age, expanding and thus splitting the stone. The rock is 160 feet or so out from the shore. The beach can be accessed by walking down a short track just outside the town of Kaiteriteri; alternatively, kayak tours or water taxis will let you see the rock from the sea. In 2014, the formation was officially named Tokangawhā / Split Apple Rock.  You can walk out to the rock at low tide (you'll still be wading through water). Or, when the water's high, you can kayak there. Public toilets are available near the beach on Moonraker Way.",mythology rock formations rocks geological oddities geology

The facilities opened in 1999 welcoming waves of photo-happy tourists and art lovers who wanted not just to relieve themselves but also record the experience. Recycled bottles and tiles are embedded in the concrete of the facilities to create the psychedelic designs. In addition to the standard men’s and women’s stalls, the center of the toilets has a living tree that grows up through the roof of the pavilion and blends with the native grasses that are grown on the roof. Hundertwasser passed away in 2000 shortly after the toilets were opened, making them the final piece of art that he would produce in his lifetime.

Underneath the continuous plumes of white smoke, there are brilliant yellows, teal blues, acid greens, and rust reds. But when Captain Cook sailed by the small volcanic island in 1769 he only got close enough to see the smoke. So White Island it became. The bright yellow comes from the volcano’s natural sulfur. So much sulfur that there were a few attempts to mine the valuable element, which is used to make sulfuric acid, fertilizer, and other commercial products. The year 1914 saw how dangerous sulfur mining on an active volcano can be, when the island’s mining camp disappeared under a landslide from a collapsed crater wall. Accounts differ, with either ten or twelve miners working that day, but whatever the number, all were swallowed up by the island. The only witness to survive the disaster was Peter the Great. Unfortunately, as the camp cat, he couldn’t tell the authorities much about what happened. Thirty miles off the coast of the New Zealand’s North Island in the Bay of Plenty, White Island is officially called Whakaari/White Island in order to honor both the Maori and European names (although it’s mostly referred to as White Island). It’s small, only about a mile across with the volcano’s crater walls reaching just over a thousand feet above the Bay. Looks can be deceiving, however – what you see rising out of the water is only the peak of a much bigger undersea mountain, roughly four times the size of the island. It’s still erupting regularly, even as recently as December 2019.  Whakaari/White Island is in the Bay of Plenty about 30 miles from shore, 140 miles east of Auckland.

The rocky shoals that extend out from Matakaea (Shag Point) represent the petrified hull of the canoe, the Maori say, and the nearby rocky promontory represents the body of the captain. The Moeraki Boulders are actually a type of huge stone that is recognizable for being highly spherical. They can be found scattered around the Koekohe Beach near Moeraki, a small town on Aotearoa (New Zealand’s) Otago coast. This section of beach has been protected by the government as a scientific reserve. The Moeraki Boulders are not the only rocks of this size and shape; there are huge spherical boulders molded over millions of years on other Aotearoa coasts as well. Weighing several tons each, the Moeraki Boulders originally formed about 60 million years ago during the early Paleocene. Some can measure up to nine feet across. For millions of years, the boulders lay buried underground, covered up over time. Slowly, they have emerged as waves wash away the mudstone. As mesmerizing as the boulders are there is a stunning array of seaweed, invertebrates, shells, bryozoan and ascidians (filter feeders that sieve food particles out of the water) and sponges washed up on the beach.

This stunning landscape where the Tasman Sea meets the Pacific Ocean is considered by the Maori to be sacred ground, as it is the jumping-off point for souls of the recently deceased to journey to meet their ancestors in the spiritual homeland. According to Maori legend, when a person dies their spirit makes the long journey north to this point, specifically to a gnarled pohutukawa tree that has managed to cling to a cliff while still bearing the brunt of the sea. Here the spirit slides down the roots of the tree into the sea, moving away from the mainland towards Three Kings Island and onto Ohaua, where it looks one last time to see the living left behind. From there, the spirits travel to the land of the ancestors, or Hawaiiki-A-Nui. The pohutukawa tree at Cape Reinga is believed to be around 800 years old, and supposedly never blooms the characteristic bright red flowers these trees are known for. Near the tree, there used to be a small stream called Te Waiora-a-Tane. The waters from this were considered sacred, and washing the recently deceased’s body with water from Te Waiora-a-Tane was a critical part of the traditional funerary rites. It is also believed that once the soul passes the point where the stream disappears into the sea it cannot return to the land of the living. The Europeans on the island, specifically the Christian missionaries, thought this sacred water was all hocus pocus. Considering the need for a fresh water source, and that many Maori in the area at the time had converted to Christianity, the decision was made to cap the stream to make a reservoir. Little resistance was met when this was done, and yet nature has a way in things. As soon as the reservoir was finished, the stream disappeared, winding back underground out of sight. It now empties directly into the sea, and can only be seen at low tide. Cape Reinga is also significant as the meeting place of the Tasman Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The Maori call this meeting the “Te Moana-a-Rehua.” This clash of water is believed to be a male sea meeting a female sea, symbolizing the coming together of energy and the creation of life. It’s a beautiful belief that the dying leave the world as seas meet to create life anew.  To get to Cape Reinga, head north via Route 1 from any major city to the (literally) the end of the road. Mileage signs along the driving route will mark the way. Parking is available but limited, especially during summer. (It may be difficult for large vans or campers to park due to space constrictions.) The tree itself cannot be accessed by foot, but there is a nice lookout point with a small metal sign. There are also several nice photographic vantage points along lighthouse footpath for the photographically savvy. This site is very remote, so plan accordingly. There is no cell service in the area near the lighthouse, and the road leading to the lighthouse is quite windy in some places. Eating, drinking, or smoking are highly discouraged giving the spiritual importance of the place. Note that due to the difficulty of translating the Maori language, interpretive signs at the site may have different names and/or spellings.",funeral rituals lighthouses geographic markers tradition oceans death
40,Maungawhau (Mount Eden),"Auckland, New Zealand",The platform atop this verdant volcano was built with the help of a royal elephant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maungawhau-mount-eden,"At almost 650 feet high, the cone of this long-dormant volcano is the highest natural point in the Auckland region. But that’s not its only claim to fame—the stone observation platform at its peak was built with the help of an elephant. The volcano’s last eruption is thought to have been around 28,000 years ago. It spewed lava from three different cones to form the land upon which Auckland now sits. The peak, which goes by both its Māori and English names, is the highest point in the city, making it a popular destination. The 160-foot-deep crater Te Ipu-a-Mataaho (“The Bowl of Mataaho”) is named after a deity said to live inside it, guarding the secrets of the earth. In the late 19th century, much of one side of the mountain was quarried to build some of Auckland’s earliest homes, prisons and other structures in the region, as well as the platform atop the peak. The laborers were mostly Māori men and prisoners, but one was a royal elephant. Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, was to finish his 1870s tour of the Royal Navy in Auckland. When passing through Nepal, the prince was gifted a three-year-old elephant by Sir Jung Bahadoor. Alfred named the elephant Tom, and took him along to New Zealand, much to the delight of Auckland residents who had likely never seen such a creature before. Over the course of the prince’s stay the elephant was kept in the royal barracks. But his strength and size weren’t put to waste. While on board the ship from Sri Lanka to New Zealand, Tom carried 300 tons of coal across the vessel, much to the delight of the sailors. He was put to similar work on Mt. Eden’s platform, hauling heavy basalt up the mountainside. The royal pachyderm was rewarded for his labor with candy and beer. Today, the mountaintop platform remains one of Auckland’s most popular tourist sites for its beautiful views of the city and surrounding area. Tom’s life didn’t last quite so long, but his memory still remains. He did not stay in New Zealand, but relocated to several British zoos before his death in 1882 at the Dublin Zoo. The zoo held onto his remains, and in 2010 they were purchased by the Trinity College Zoological Museum, where they are now on display.",maori elephants craters quarries volcanoes mountains geology animals
41,Hot Water Beach,"Hot Water Beach, New Zealand",Handcrafted thermal spa washes away each night with the tide.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hot-water-beach,"The average hot tub costs a couple thousand dollars, but Hot Water Beach allows people to carve their own thermal hot tub right on the beach in New Zealand. With just a few thrusts of a shovel, beach-goers can watch a slow gurgle of warm, geothermal water rise from below the sand to gently fill a personal spa-like pool. In peak season, hundreds take to the beach with their bucket and trowel, digging pools just big enough to lay out in the water, which can reach temperatures of 147 degrees Fahrenheit. Those who forget a spade still can’t be dismayed, as the local surf shop rents out digging tools for hot-tub creation. Despite the comfort of the beach side spa, visitors must be careful not to venture too close to the water past low tide, as the breaking waves and rip currents near the beach have a notorious and dangerous track record. Unfortunately for beach-goers, their hard work creating the perfect shoreline hot tub is all for naught as high tide comes in and washes down the walls of their personal tubs.",beaches geological oddities natural wonders water geology nature

Identified in the 1920s when surveyors were working on State Highway 12, which runs through the forest, the Tāne Mahuta believed to be somewhere between 1,250 and 2,500 years old. A remnant of the ancient subtropical rainforest that once covered this section of the North Auckland Peninsula, Tāne Mahuta is named with Maori mythology in mind. In Maori, Tāne is the son of the sky father, and Papatuanuku the earth mother. All of the living creatures in the forest are considered to be Tāne’s children. Tāne Mahuta is easily the most famous tree in all of New Zealand even though other massive kauri trees are located nearby.

43,Dark Sky Project,"Lake Tekapo, New Zealand","Home to some of the world’s darkest skies, this project blends ancient Māori culture with world-class astro tourism.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dark-sky-project,"The Dark Sky Project (formerly known as Earth and Sky) offers a fully guided, multimedia indoor astronomy experience on the Tekapo lakefront in New Zealand. The 1140-square-meter building gives visitors a 45-minute daytime astronomical experience that combines Māori (the indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand) heritage with modern-day scientific discovery. For the Māori, the sky was used as a sacred roadmap to mark not only time and place, but also the natural flow of Earth cycles, including fishing and harvesting seasons, and even to gauge when accidents or death might fall upon members of their communities. The Māori people currently make up around 14 percent of New Zealand’s population. The building that houses the Dark Sky Project was named after Rehua, the eldest child of the Māori gods and an important star where knowledge is believed to come from. It’s also the Māori name for the road to Tekapo, Te Ara o Rehua, also known as the starlight highway. The first of its kind in the world, the Dark Sky Project blends research from the University of Canterbury at the Mt John Observatory with tātai aroraki (Māori astronomy). The initiative worked closely with the Māori, the University of Canterbury, and Professor Rangi Mātāmua, an expert in Māori astronomy. As part of the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve, the location is one of the darkest—and quietest—spots on the planet, offering visitors a phenomenal view of the mysterious wonders of the Southern skies. For its new indoor Dark Sky Experience, the tour begins over 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang and uses tātai aroraki (Māori astronomy) to anchor the sensory adventure. For its stargazing experiences, the reserve has one of the world’s busiest night skies, where guests can catch glimpses of shooting stars and distant planets. At Te Tahitaha o Te Raki (also known as the Earth’s edge), thousands of visitors soak up spectacular views of the Milky Way each year. Unlike most places around the world affected by light pollution, this location preserves the night sky and advocates for minimal light pollution. There’s also a “giant purpose-built crater” observatory for private viewing experiences of the Southern skies, complete with powerful optical telescopes. “Experiencing a truly dark night sky can inspire a sense of awe and wonder about our place in the universe—this is what motivates us both as researchers and as human beings,” says Associate Professor Karen Pollard of University of Canterbury (UC).  The Dark Sky Project recommends booking tickets in advance “to avoid disappointment,” so be sure to check out their website before embarking on your journey. The tours are also provided in English, Japanese, and Chinese and depart at every hour in each language.",dark skies maori astronomy science

However the Shackleton expedition was made just a bit brighter by the presence of the ship’s cat, Mrs. Chippy. Harry McNeish was a carpenter on Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance expedition to Antarctica, as well as a member of the long journey from Elephant Island to South Georgia to look for help and rescue for the rest of the expedition members. He was also known as the caretaker of Mrs. Chippy, the cat that accompanied the men until the Endurance became trapped in pack ice. Unfortunately Mrs. Chippy was shot along with the sled dogs once the team became trapped in the ice. To honor the brave kitty, the New Zealand Antarctic Society added a bronze statue of Mrs. Chippy to McNeish’s grave in 2004, seen as she would usually lounge on his bed onboard the ship.",cats graves gravestones memorials monuments animals
45,Larnach Castle,"Dunedin, New Zealand","One of New Zealand’s few castles boasts beautiful gardens, grand architecture, and a history filled with family drama.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/larnach-castle,"One of only a few castles in all of New Zealand, Larnach Castle has a scandalous history, one rich with family drama, death, and a slew of ghost stories. The interior is filled with vintage furniture, striking designs, and cat artwork. This architectural oddity would be difficult to stumble across, unless you knew it was there. While New Zealand has a number of bustling metropolitan hubs, tucked away in the South Island is the city of Dunedin. Wandering through the streets here, you’ll find dozens of tiny shops stacked high with curiosities and vintage wares, as well as a vibrant student population during university months. Modeled on Edinburgh in style and layout (and even taking an adapted version of its Gaelic name, Dùn Èideann), Dunedin has the allure of a hidden city, the type of place that time forgot. To add to its old-world charm, tucked up on the hills of the Otago Peninsula, overlooking the city on one side and the Pacific Ocean on the other, lies Larnach Castle. William Larnach, a wealthy merchant banker and politician, built the castle for his first wife in the late 19th century. It took over 200 workmen three years to build the exterior. European craftsmen spent another 12 years completing the manor’s interior. Larnach spared no expense when it came to constructing this late Victorian-era abode. Both the exterior and interior use extravagant stones and materials that were imported from all across the world. Sadly, Larnach committed suicide in a Parliament building in 1898, his ruined finances and a rumored affair between his third wife and youngest son driving him into despair. The family fell apart due to legal battles over his estate. Larnach Castle passed through several hands and was eventually reduced to shambles until its current owners, the Baker family, bought it in 1967 and became dedicated to restoring it. The garden—which the New Zealand Garden Trust has deemed a Garden of International Significance—is in itself worth the visit. In winter, snow will likely blanket its beauty. In summer, spring, and fall, however, it is a nature lover’s wonderland, stretching all the way from the doorstep of the castle to the edge of the ocean.  Tours of the interior can be made by booking online. The staff is highly knowledgeable about the history and scandals of the Larnach Family. There are a lot of stairs, so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. If you want to ascend to the spire, be prepared for some steep climbing and a tight stairwell. The views really are spectacular, so it's well worth it.The gardens are also extensive and you can easily spend a few hours wandering around.

46,Rere Rockslide,"Rere, New Zealand",Nature's slip and slide.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rere-rockslide,"Just outside the city of Gisborne in New Zealand is an amazing water ride that is not connected to any kind of theme park. It is purely a result of the natural flow of the Wharekopae River, and it is completely free to ride. The Rere Rockslide, off Wharekopae Road, is a flat slab of rock nearly 200 feet long (60 meters) that descends at a 30-degree slope into a deep pool. Water running over the rock has smoothed it over the centuries, making it safe to ride down the slide on some kind of floating device (or, though it is not advised, on your stomach). All manner of thing is ridden down the rockslide, including strips of cardboard, boogie boards, tires, inflatable mattresses, inflatable chairs, yoga mats, kiddy pools, and inner tubes. They each provide a different experience: Inflatable mattress rides tend to be more leisurely, boogie boards more exciting. However fast one goes, the pool at the bottom cushions the blow as the ride ends. The Rere Rockslide tends to be busy pretty much all day, but early in the morning it can be found empty and calm. The nearby Rere Waterfall, while not as exciting, can also be fun for water adventurers. People can walk along behind the water curtain (carefully, because the rocks are slippery), and though it cannot be slid over, some find it fun to jump into the pool at its base from the top of the falls. Eastwoodhill Arboretum is also nearby, and a nice place to walk around in nature. There is parking off Wharekopae Road. The Gisborne District Council takes care of the rockslide, but visitors are expected to take their means of sliding and anything else they brought to the area away with them to keep it clean. Visitors are advised, by way of signs, that though the rockslide is safe for people of most ages, it can be dangerous if you're not careful.

The Dunedin Museum of Natural Mystery is a tiny collection of curios that attempt to show off the beauty of bones and the bizarre. Spread over three rooms of an old central city villa, the museum contains a collection of skulls, bones, biological curiosities, ethnological art, and unusual cultural and paranormal artifacts which the artist has collected over a lifetime. There’s also a gallery featuring the artist’s trademark textural bone sculptures and paintings of animals on canvas. Most of the things in the little museum have been personally picked up or kindly donated by the artist’s friends and colleagues. Nearly everything in the museum has some connection with the world of nature, but there are also a few other interesting things that just seem to fit. The collection is always changing, as items are added or removed. The artists concocts new displays that he adds to the mix, and also improves and revamps older ones. The museum might be small, but it’s got the skeleton of much greater ambitions.  The Museum is open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. See its website for opening hours on public holidays. It costs NZ$10 to visit the museum for waged adults, $20 for families( two adults and up to three children), and $5 for unwaged/students and young people aged 6-16. Children under 6 can visit for free. Parking is available on the street or in the driveway by arrangement. Alternatively, it's a short walk up the hill from George Street or Olveston.

48,Wrights Hill Fortress,"Wellington, New Zealand",Anyone wanting to know what a dwarven mine sounds like need only visit the tunnels of this New Zealand artillery compound.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wrights-hill-fortress,"Built in the early 1940’s, the Wrights Hill Fortress is a circular artillery embankment that consists mostly of long underground tunnels which were actually used to create the sound of the dwarven mines of Middle Earth. Completed in the final years of World War II, the fort was meant to have three large guns positioned on the above ground portion, although only two (9.2” Mk. XV’s for you armaments fans out there) were ever installed. The squat circular base was not much to look at above ground, but below ground it contained a labyrinth of tight concrete tunnels, some buried as deep as 50 feet deep in the earth. Most of the space underground was used as storage or office space, although there were also rooms filled with large diesel engines for power. The base never saw any action during the war, but both of the massive guns were fired in the years following the cessation of hostilities. The test fires shot projectiles out over the New Zealand territory seemingly just to say that they hadn’t been put in place for nothing. Although their existence really did end up amounting to little as they were scrapped in 1960, with the parts being sold to the Japanese, possibly as a way of saying, “here we built these guns for you anyway.” The fort was abandoned not long after. Today the fortress has been restored by a preservation society and officially named a historic landmark. On certain holidays the 2,000 some feet of tunnels are opened to visitors. The site is also often used as a set for televisions and film productions. Famously the tunnels beneath the base were used as an audio palette for the Mines of Moria in Peter Jackson’s Fellowship of the Ring. Creating tunnels 50 feet underground might not be deep enough to unleash a Balrog, but it is deep enough to sound like you could.",fantasy locations fortresses forts film locations film military history military
49,World's Loneliest Tree,"Campbell Island / Motu Ihupuku, New Zealand",The most remote tree in the world is more than 170 miles from its nearest neighbor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-loneliest-tree,"Nestled in a windswept cove, the lone tree on the subantarctic Campbell Island / Motu Ihupuku in New Zealand shouldn’t technically be there. The Sitka spruce, a native of the northern hemisphere, is a long way from its taxonomic cousins—and in fact, the closest tree of any kind is more than 170 miles northeast on the Auckland Islands. The lonely tree was planted around the turn of the 20th century by New Zealand’s then-governor, Lord Ranfurly. More than 100 years later, the introduced spruce is considered the most isolated tree in the world, after the former record-holder, the Tree of Ténéré in the Sahara Desert was mowed down by a drunk driver. The conifer endures not only isolation but also the wild weather of the “Furious Fifties” latitudes. Campbell Island has the cloudiest climate in the subantarctic, with rain for 325 days and gale-force winds for 100 days of the year. Surprisingly, the spruce seems to be thriving in these conditions, growing at a rate five to ten times faster than normal. Still, the 30-foot-tall tree lacks the cone-shaped crown characteristic of the species, instead growing into a poofy cauliflower shape. It’s thought that this unusual silhouette is due to the central trunk being removed to serve as a Christmas tree. This likely happened several decades ago, when the island played host to year-round meteorological staff. Although this rugged, windswept speck of land lacks trees, it is home to an array of other botanical curiosities, including otherworldly flower fields of “megaherbs.” The Loneliest Tree is a poignant reminder of the human impact on this fragile and unique ecosystem. Campbell Island was exploited by humans for whaling, sealing, and farming since its discovery in 1810. Other human imports, including destructive rats and feral cattle, have been removed, but the Sitka spruce remains, a lone sentinel. In 2014, scientists took core samples from the 100-year-old tree to examine climate information contained within the tree’s rings. Despite its remote location at the bottom of the world, the tree’s rings record radiocarbon from above-ground nuclear testing. This perhaps serves as a reliable marker for the advent of the Anthropocene—the geological age of humans. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the world’s loneliest tree.  Campbell Island is an UNESCO World Heritage Site and nature reserve administered by New Zealand’s Department of Conservation. Access is restricted and a permit is required to land.

Tākapu is the Māori name for these southern seabirds, which are native to New Zealand and known to mate for life. The female lays one single pale blue egg, and co-parents with her partner, taking turns at hatching, sheltering and feeding their juvenile. In its fourth month, the young Tākapu embarks on a 1,700-mile journey across the Tasman Sea to the east coast of Australia. The journey takes anywhere from 8 to 14 days and is repeated four years later when the birds return to New Zealand to breed. Once back in New Zealand, the adult birds won’t usually migrate again. They spend spring and summer at the breeding colony and during the winter months disperse to local coastal waters. Breeding takes place anytime between mid-September until mid-December.

Tolkien was writing his description of Edoras, the capital city/fort of the kingdom of Rohan, he most likely had no idea that he was essentially describing New Zealand’s Mount Sunday. Nestled in the Canterbury Plains of the South Island, Mount Sunday feels worlds away from any civilization. But, in reality, this majestic spot is only about two hours southwest of Christchurch. The low mountain sits in the middle of towering alps on a flat river plain, giving it a lonely, expansive feel. Because of director Peter Jackson’s vision, the world of Tolkien was eventually brought to life on film, using much of New Zealand’s natural landscape as the backdrop. When it came time film the portion of The Two Towers that takes place in Rohan’s seat of power, Jackson saw the remote beauty of Mount Sunday’s isolated peak as the perfect spot for the home of the horse-lords. The entire town of Edoras was actually built on the mount, including the large great hall, and it was all taken down at the end of filming. Any diehard Lord of the Rings fan knows that no trip to New Zealand would be complete without a stop here. But a visit to Mount Sunday isn’t just for LOTR fans. If you don’t have a a lot of time to visit all the picturesque places the South Island has to offer, Mount Sunday, and the areas immediately surrounding it, provide a great glimpse of the area’s natural beauty without having to travel too far. The best way to get there is to book a tour out of Christchurch. Go with a company who really knows the area well, because it's on private property and not exactly the easiest place to get to.

The park also served as the set for Rivendell, hidden refuge of the elves, in the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings trilogy. The park was opened in 1983, as part of a plan that established a number of regional parks in the Wellington region. A plot of land owned by the Wellington Regional Water Board was expanded with the purchase of land from a logging company. Filming for Rivendell and the Fords of Isen took place in the park. It contains the locations where Elrond says farewell to the Fellowship of the Ring, where Frodo looks out from the balcony during his recovery after being stabbed by a Nazgul blade, and where the iconic kiss between Aragorn and Arwen took place, among other recognizable moments. All buildings, walkways, and other structures were removed after filming was complete, but a half size replica of the archway was recreated so that visiting fans can imagine what the original would have looked like and take photographs.

Demolition World is an extension of David and Lee Fallow’s family scrap business. Their collection, curated and staged as a mysterious small town, comes from years of buying and selling salvage, building demo, rescuing and recycling old structures, and scooping up stock overruns. Beginning in 2003, they hit on an eerily charming way for customers to peruse it all, by elaborately set decorating their little corner of southern New Zealand. The familiar and the exotic create a carefully assembled community here, including an entirely rebuilt church (where a bride with golden ringlets is left at the altar), a pioneer kitchen, a toy shop, an imaginary medical and dental clinic (best to leave that one to the imaginary health department), and a medieval banquet attended by utterly bored metallic mannequins. The mannequin population also includes rare vintage models, some from as early as the 1940s, including a line-up of rainbow-haired beauties hanging from the rafters. If they don’t creep you out enough, feel free to poke around for the puppets. Despite an air of general creepiness, Demolition World—just like the owners—is jovial and welcoming, where stories of the collection and creation of the little town flow freely.

Coated in a shiny pink glaze and speckled with sprinkles, the doughy delight looks identical to Homer Simpson’s favorite snack. And this quirky roadside attraction is indeed tied to The Simpsons. American movie studio 20th Century Fox gifted the strange statue’s ill-fated predecessor to the community in 2007 to promote its upcoming premiere of The Simpsons Movie, as the New Zealand town shares a name with the fictional town the iconic cartoons inhabit. Installing the colossal confection was meant to be a publicity stunt for both the movie and the small town. However, it unfortunately drew the wrong type of attention. In September 2009, an arsonist set the statue ablaze and burned the doughnut to a crisp. Determined to keep the doughnut legacy alive, the town erected a pink-painted tire in its place. The makeshift monument stood for roughly three years until it was replaced by this concrete version in July of 2012. Metal steps behind the doughnut let people climb up and poke their heads through the hole for photos. Luckily, this newest version is fireproof: it will hopefully remain a positive icon for the town and an unexpected treat for visitors for years to come.",donuts giant food cartoons pop culture roadside attractions statues food
58,Weta Cave,"Wellington, New Zealand","Inside this faux cave, visitors can learn how some of their favorite fantasy characters were created.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/weta-cave,"Weta Cave is the shop and tours section of the award-winning Weta Workshop. The workshop was founded in Wellington’s Miramar Peninsula in 1987 by husband and wife Richard Taylor and Tania Rodgers. Noted New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson collaborated with Weta for practical effects from his first feature film, Bad Taste. But it was the work of Weta Workshop and Weta Digital in Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings film trilogy that made Weta a household name in filmmaking throughout the world, and lead to the Weta Cave’s opening in 2008. As such it, makes sense that this space is primarily a The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit souvenir shop, but there are many other fantastic offerings around the cave, including memorabilia from other Weta collaborations such as The Chronicles of Narnia and Alita: Battle Angel. Outside, visitors can take photos in front of a door made just for a hobbit, and with life-size trolls from the films. The interior is filled with movie props and costume pieces from films such as Avatar and District 9. Weta Cave also hosts guided tours, which consist of 45 minutes of film creativity and Weta Workshop insight. The guides and Weta Cave retail staff are passionate and relish at the opportunity to share their film knowledge with visitors.

59,Farewell Spit,"Puponga, New Zealand",This deadly little sliver of beach has seen hundreds of whales beach themselves over the years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/farewell-spit,"Splaying off from the northern tip of New Zealand’s southern island, the skinny little beach known as Farewell Spit is a lovely and remote piece of nature that seems to call to whales who are looking to kill themselves. Despite what one might think, the name of Farewell Spit (called “Onetahua” by the native New Zealanders) does not refer to saying goodbye to the scores of whales that have run aground on the sands over the years but is actually a reference to nearby Cape Farewell, which was named such for the traditionally sentimental reasons. In fact there does not seem to be any reference to the many mammals who have died there over the years, only when the aquatic giants are laying there drying out in the sun would someone guess how deadly the spot is. Since anyone started recording such a statistic, 680 whales have died from stranding themselves on the spit. In 2015 some 200 whales beached themselves on the sand, although many were able to be floated back out to sea by concerned activists and the tides. No one is exactly sure why whales strand themselves in general, although it is thought that near Farewell Spit it has to do with the shallow waters surrounding the sands interfering with their natural navigation. The clear social bonds between whales may also play a factor with just a few whales creating a tragic chain reaction that lead to dozens of grounded giants. There is an automated lighthouse near the tip of the spit that keeps ships from running afoul of the same fate as so many whales down the years; it’s just too bad so many majestic creatures couldn’t see the light.",underwater week whales beaches animals

While the colonial exhibition has a respectable array of European pioneer artifacts, the museum’s real attraction is the broad collection of Māori artifacts. It includes an extensive range of significant items in extraordinary condition, dating back to the 1400s. The highlights of the collection are a replica wharenui (meeting house), hand-carved observing all Māori traditions and Tapu (spiritual code), using original materials from other meeting houses. There is also a hand-carved waka (war canoe) dating back to 1867, as well as stone tools and personal adornments. The museum is housed in the old Okains Bay Cheese Factory, which was converted and opened as a public museum in 1977, in the decades since the collection has been categorized and expanded, becoming an impressive look at what life on the Peninsula was like in ancient and colonial times. In the main courtyard are preserved colonial-era buildings including a working Blacksmith shop from the early 20th century. The museum also hosts an annual event on the 6th of February for Waitangi Day, which includes demonstrations of traditional Māori dance, a Māori hāngi (traditional method of roasting food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven) and an impressive display of the waka in the river. Okains Bay is on the Banks Peninsula, only hour away from Christchurch and a short drive over the hill from from Akaroa which is a popular tourist destination with some breathtaking views over the harbour on the way.",maori culture cultures and civilizations colonialism ancient museums and collections museums

It’s a peaceful place, one without tourist boats and very few structures at all. You may notice it while standing on the city’s shore, or while cruising along on a ferry to one of the more developed islands. This oasis of serenity is Browns Island, or Motukorea in Māori.  Though it looks quiet, it’s actually a remnant of the land’s volatile past, as it’s one of the Auckland volcanic field’s most intact volcanoes. The island once bustled with human activity, too. It’s speckled with archaeological ruins from Māori pā, meaning villages or defensive settlements. For centuries, the Māori gardened on the little island and used it as a base while fishing. Regular tour boats don’t stop at Browns Island, but it’s accessible by private sailboat, kayak, or seaplane. When you’re on the island, you’ll notice it seems like a steep, grass-covered hill plopped within the harbor. You can see down into the main caldera from the top of the hill, as well as three volcanic cones on the curving slopes.

They are impossible. Not impossible however, is a device which uses available energy, solar or water for example, to do its work for it. Not so much a perpetual motion device, as just a very efficient (or should you be feeling judgmental, lazy) machine. Such is the Beverly Clock, a clock invented in 1864 by Arthur Beverly and located in the foyer of the Department of Physics at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. Run on atmospheric pressure and changes in the temperature, an airtight box inside the clock expands and contracts throughout the day pushing on a diaphragm. It takes only a six-degree Celsius temperature variation over a day to raise a one-pound weight an inch. This in turn descends, powering the clock. Despite having never been wound, the clock has indeed stopped running a number of times due to mechanical failure, for cleaning, and on a few occasions when the temperature and atmospheric pressure has remained steady for very long periods of time. Despite this, because the mechanism continues to function, the Beverly clock is considered one of the world’s longest running experiments, and is the closest anyone will ever see to a “perpetual motion machine.” This location took part in Obscura Day 2010!

65,'Diminish and Ascend',"Christchurch, New Zealand",This aluminum “stairway to heaven” has impaled at least a couple of birds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/diminish-and-ascend,"“Diminish and Ascend” is a welded aluminum sculpture by New Zealand artist David McCracken. Unveiled in 2013 at the “Sculpture by the Sea” exhibition in Sydney, the staircase-like structure now stands in a lake at the Christchurch Botanic Gardens. When it was first unveiled in Bondi Beach in Sydney, “Diminish and Ascend” reached up and over the edge of a cliff, giving the impression, from some angles at least, of an endless “stairway to heaven” stretching up into the sky. The optical illusion was achieved by having fairly regular-sized steps at the base, which slowly narrowed to a point at the very end. Rather than reaching infinitely to the heavens, the sculpture was in fact about 31 feet long. It was an impressive sight, and became one of the most photographed sculptures at that year’s “Sculpture by the Sea.” According to McCracken, the idea for “Diminish and Ascend” came about years before its creation, during “a conversation about a performance piece depicting a ladder, or similar, that required the protagonist to grow smaller in order to ascend … a kind of Lewis Carroll device that we talked about achieving with shadow puppetry or projection.” McCracken made a rudimentary sketch of a stairway designed using a perspective illusion, which years later he turned into a sculpture. After Bondi Beach, “Diminish and Ascend” was displayed at “Sculpture on the Gulf” on Waiheke Island in New Zealand. Then, in 2016, it was installed in Kiosk Lake in the grounds of Christchurch Botanic Gardens in New Zealand, where it stands today. Since its installation in the lake, the stairway has become a popular hangout among resident ducks and visiting seagulls, who like to gather on the steps (with monthly poo-removal costs amounting to about NZ$700). For at least two gulls, however, the sculpture’s “stairway to heaven” tag has proved all too literal. The unfortunate birds accidentally flew into the sculpture’s pointy end, impaling themselves on the tip of the stairway. Following the bird impaling incidents, McCracken agreed he had to do something about it, and suggested removing the metal tip and replacing it with silicone painted to look like steel. It’s unclear if such a change ever occurred. As for the artist’s future projects, he still hopes to build a second Diminish and Ascend but “on a truly monumental scale for permanent placement.” Hot air ballooners, you have been warned…  ""Diminish and Ascend"" is located in Kiosk Lake in the grounds of Christchurch Botanic Gardens in New Zealand.

For years these downed science vessels have simply sunk down to the bottom of the sea in a place now known as the Spacecraft Cemetery. While a great deal of debris and smaller satellites burn up upon re-entry, larger items—including entire space stations—need to be disposed of in a way that keeps the hazardous materials out of public circulation. And what better place than the dark depths of the ocean? Among the craft that has been scuttled at the spot are unmanned satellites, waste freighters carrying astronaut poop, and, possibly most remarkably, the entire decommissioned Russian space station Mir. Many have speculated that on the dark day the International Space Station must come down to Earth, it too will be deposited in the “graveyard.” The accumulated space junk may eventually grow abundant enough to create a sort of futuristic reef, or a preserved record of our orbital ambitions waiting to be rediscovered by the archaeologists of the future.",underwater space exploration graveyards cemeteries
67,Hiakai,"Wellington, New Zealand",This fine-dining restaurant features native New Zealand ingredients and Māori cooking.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hiakai,"Hiakai means “hungry” or “having a craving to eat” in te reo Māori, the Māori language. At Hiakai, a restaurant in Wellington, New Zealand, chef Monica Fiso’s seeks to feed the Māori hunger to finally see their culture celebrated by the mainstream. Telling Māori stories through locally farmed and foraged ingredients is typical of Fiso, who draws on her Māori, Sāmoan, and European roots, as well as her training in posh New York restaurants, to craft a menu centering New Zealand’s long-neglected indigenous foods. Take, for example, Fiso’s seed-coated avocado with vinaigrette made from karamū, a native shrub. It represents Mount Pihanga, a New Zealand volcano that Māori people consider feminine, and who inspired seven male mountains to fight for her love in a classic tale. The menu at Hiakai combines haute cuisine techniques—“foams” and “essences” abound—as well as traditional Māori cooking styles, such as hāngi earthen ovens, which European colonialism either marginalized or misinterpreted. With dishes like kūmara (sweet potato) gnocchi with fried huhu grubs to kina sea urchin pannacotta with with kuku mussels, it’s obvious that at Hiakai, promoting and preserving Māori food culture comes first.  Hiakai exclusively serves a seven course tasting menu, and is reservation-only. Slots in the small dining room fill up months in advance, so book early.",indigenous restaurants food

It’s a site that’s sure to please lovers of the cult film “Rocky Horror Picture Show.” The artwork was erected at the former site of the barbershop where the Hamilton native Richard O’Brien, the film’s creator, cut hair in the late ‘50s and early ‘60s. There, you’ll find a life-size statue of the character Riff Raff (played by O’Brien) in full alien regalia from when he time warps from the fictional planet Transsexual. Those who take the time to look more closely at the brightly colored surroundings will find something else too. Along with the statue are instructions on how to do the iconic “Time Warp” (again).

69,Quasi,"Wellington, New Zealand",The 16-foot sculpture of a hand looks out from his perch on top of an art gallery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quasi-hand-face,"Quasi is many things—public art, rooftop decoration, New Zealand native—but, primarily, Quasi is a face and a hand. Rather, Quasi is a face on a hand. Standing at a little over 16 feet tall, the sculpture is the brainchild of New Zealand artist Ronnie van Hout. Quasi is sort of a self-portrait of van Hout, who scanned his hand and his face and then smashed the two things in polystyrene and resin together to make—what else?—art. Quasi started off as a working title—recalling Quasimodo, from Victor Hugo’s 1831 novel Hunchback of Notre-Dame—and stuck. In a short video from the Christchurch City Council Civic Offices, van Hout says Quasi represents outsiders, and the way society rejects things that are different. “It should make people smile,” “It’s not scary necessarily.” Van Hout created Quasi to “liven up” a Civic Square in his hometown of Christchurch, New Zealand after the town was damaged in a 2011 earthquake, according to The Guardian. Quasi was installed in 2016 and spent three years on top of the Christchurch Art Gallery before moving to the roof of the Wellington City Gallery in 2019, where the sculpture will remain for three years. In 2016, the locals’ reaction was…mixed. The Christchurch art critic Warren Feeney wrote a listicle screed entitled “Ten reasons why Christchurch Art Gallery’s Quasi must go.” Many others hated it. But when Quasi moved to Wellington, Twitter user Ishmael (@beesechunger) tweeted “give him back he was ours the gross hand belongs to christchurch.” This fondness seems more in line with van Hout’s dream for Quasi. “Hopefully people will go past and smile, and maybe that’s enough,” he said in the video. In 2019, to welcome Quasi to their city, the Wellington City Gallery conducted a Q&A with van Hout. Interviewer Megan Dunn asked: “Should we love Quasi?” and van Hout responded “How much could we love a detached hand that has taken on a life of its own?”  Quasi sits on the roof of the Wellington City Gallery and is visible to anyone walking by.

The shells quickly became the defining feature of the house, turning the couple’s home in Bluff into a celebrated tourist attraction. The house’s exterior gave little indication of the spectacular collection within, but once inside, visitors were ushered into the couple’s famous Shell Lounge. Paua shells occupy nearly every surface of this extraordinary living room, their iridescent surfaces creating an effect that is almost overwhelming. Clocks, telephones, picture frames, and various other knick-knacks were all incorporated into the shell motif. Visitors added to the chaotic surroundings by leaving calling cards wedged between the shells and the wall. Enchanting, kitschy, even tacky – however you choose to describe it, no one can deny the Fluteys’ dedication to their collection. When the Fluteys died in the early 2000s, their grandson purchased the house and loaned the shell collection to the Canterbury Museum, despite the protests of some Bluff residents who objected to the shells’ relocation. The museum recreated the Fluteys’ lounge in painstaking detail, working from photos of the original lounge and using much of the original furniture and decorations. The exhibit was opened to the public in 2008 and includes a short film about the Fluteys and their unusual obsession.",eccentric homes outsider art houses homes collections museums

On its outskirts, you’ll find an eye-opening reminder of the living conditions of its oft-overlooked workers. Arrowtown was a bustling gold rush village in the 19th century. During the Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s, workers flocked to the area to search the Arrow River for the precious mineral. At its peak, around 7,000 people called the settlement home. But not everyone who came to Arrowtown was fully integrated into the community. The Chinese gold miners were forced to live in modest huts along a creek that meandered around the edge of the town. Their small settlement became somewhat of a village of its own, one that stood in stark contrast to the main town. Many of the huts have now been preserved and restored. They give visitors a chance to see a different side of Arrowtown than its postcard-perfect commercial avenue. Viewing the ramshackle huts is a reminder of the hard work and harsh conditions the Chinese workers endured.   Arrowtown is roughly a 20-minute drive from Queenstown.

Using water to represent money, the massive hydraulic model of a national economy was, for a time, the most complex, and wettest, economics computer in the world. The MONIAC on display in the Reserve Bank Museum is one of 14 built. It was originally owned by the London School of Economics and calibrated to represent the British economy. A second MONIAC, linked to the first, represented the rest of the world. The MONIAC is one of the most popular exhibits in the Reserve Bank Museum and Education Centre and remains an impressive demonstration of engineering and economic expertise. MONIAC Moniac demonstrations are held on the first Wednesday of the month between 12.15 and 12.45pm. In 1990, the MONIAC was brought to New Zealand by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research and refurbished, including re-calibration to the New Zealand economy. In 1990 it was lent to the Reserve Bank Museum and Education Centre and further refurbishment work was done. Leakage is always a risk, and the display cabinet in which it is installed has been especially built with drainage and a drip-tray. The MONIAC is capable of making complex calculations that could not be performed by any other computer at the time. The calculations are based on Keynesian and classical economic principles, with various tanks representing households, business, government, exporting and importing sectors of the economy. Water pumped around the system can be measured as income, spending and GDP. The system is programmable, and experiments with fiscal policy, monetary policy and exchange rates can be carried out. Besides the working MONIAC at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, MONIAC machines can also be seen at the Istanbul University, Cambridge University and London’s Science Museum.  The museum and education center hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday to Friday. It's closed weekends and public holidays.

Adrian Mann began constructing the musical wonder, which he named after his great-great-grandfather, when he was just 15 years old. He got the idea to build the instrument in 2004, after stumping his teacher with his question about how long brass strings would have to be to create the correct notes if they weren’t wrapped in their usual copper wire. When his teacher couldn’t give him an answer, he set out to find out for himself. Mann completed his mission in 2009, at age 20. The piano clocks in at an impressive 18 3/4 feet, which is more than twice as large as a typical concert grand. Creating the enormous instrument was a group effort: neighbors and friends provided spaces to build it, and others helped by donating money, timber, and tools. The piano toured New Zealand for a while, where it made appearances in shipping terminals, churches, schools, and even at the Otago Museum. Amateur musicians and professionals alike have tickled its keys. But now, after its many stints on the road, the piano has come home to Mann’s workshop in Dunedin. It arrived with a fire department escort in September of 2017 and has remained available for the public to admire ever since.",teens world's largest music
80,The Huddleston,"Hamilton, New Zealand","A steampunk airship ""floats"" above Hamilton Gardens delivering plants and compost.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-huddleston-hamilton-new-zealand,"Head to these delightfully whimsical gardens, and you can’t help but notice an airship bobbing in the breeze, looking as though it recently crashed within a thicket of trees. The Huddleston is one of the newest editions to the sprawling themed gardens at Hamilton Gardens. It’s usually tethered near the Concept Garden, adding a nostalgic, steampunk flair to the greenery that harkens back to a time when steam powered the world. But the strange attraction is more than just an eye-catching blimp. It actually appears to contain fully functioning pieces of equipment. Stuffed full of gardening gadgets and gizmos, the aircraft looks like it could glide above the hedges at night, delivering plants and mulch to hard-to-reach places. The patch of land the airship floats above is a concept garden inspired by map legends and two Maori proverbs. To enter the garden, visitors must walk through a gateway that looks like an enormous yellow wardrobe. Use Gate 1 off SH1 and park at the lower car park. Walk through the red arch and head to the Concept Garden to see the airship.",steampunk aircraft gardens plants
81,Hokonui Moonshine Museum,"Gore, New Zealand",Celebrating the history of whiskey production during New Zealand's era of prohibition.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hokonui-moonshine-museum,"From the late 1800s to the middle of the 20th century, the Hokonui Hills in the Southland region of New Zealand were dotted with more than just sheep. Hidden beneath the land’s bubbling brooks and shoved into gullies were the illegal whiskey stills and wash barrels used to make and store the area’s now-signature moonshine. In the 19th century, temperance societies began lobbying for the prohibition of hard alcoholic beverages. However, their efforts did little to stop New Zealanders from secretly downing an occasional dram. For about 100 years, moonshine was still distributed throughout the country, though the region around Gore, on the nation’s South Island,  was a hotspot for those still seeking an alcoholic drink to illegally imbibe. Hokonui Moonshine weaseled its way onto the black market when a widow named Mary McRae moved to the area after leaving her native land of Scotland as a result of the Highland Clearances. Mary, already a trained distiller, decided to put her background to use. Murdoch McRae, the eldest of Mary’s seven sons and the family’s senior distiller, viewed distilling whiskey as an extension of farming. People favored the McRae’s moonshine over the bottles snuck in from Scotland and Australia, which had been diluted with so much water they’d grown almost too weak to tolerate. The McRae’s moonshine was—and still traditionally is—a pale beverage, though it has the distinct smell of whiskey and supposedly goes down rather smooth. Honey was used to give it a slight tint. The McRae’s bought sugar and yeast from local stores and managed to acquire malt from breweries. The family secretly sold their stock to professionals like doctors and lawyers, and even those living outside the southern region began to covet their creation. Unfortunately, the family also attracted the attention of authorities determined to crack down on those defying prohibition. But the McRae family was smart, and managed to thwart investigating officers by hiding any household whiskey and discussing the locations of their secluded distilleries in Scottish Gaelic, their native language. Murdoch McRae’s original moonshine recipe is still enjoyed by people today, decades after the country’s prohibition officially ended. The Hokonui Moonshine Museum in Gore celebrates the region’s involvement with creating the once-illegal beverage and the McRae family’s contribution to the cause. The small building is packed with equipment donated from local families, like whiskey stills, as well as oral histories and replicas of the whole moonshine-making process. Keep an eye out for the handwritten letter where Murdoch McRae details his family’s original recipe. In addition to honoring the once-illegal whiskey within the museum, Gore also holds an annual Hokonui Moonshine Festival.",moonshine whiskey museums and collections food museums history
82,Old Bank Arcade Animated Musical Clock,"Wellington, New Zealand",A charmingly old-fashioned reminder of the historic building's former life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-bank-arcade-animated-musical-clock,"Old Bank Arcade in Wellington, New Zealand, is actually neither an arcade nor a bank. It’s a shopping center housed in, as the name suggests, the old Bank of New Zealand. And the centerpiece of the center is a unique animated mechanical musical clock which opens each hour to reveal scenes of Wellington harbor’s past and present. The Bank of New Zealand, an architectural gem in the town, opened its headquarters in 1901. It eventually fell into disuse, and when it was renovated in the 1990s something quite unusual was found: Plimmer’s Ark, a three-masted sailing vessel, was unearthed from beneath the ground floor. In 1851, an earthquake ran the ship aground, and her wreckage had lain there ever since. It had been used as a pier, an auction house, and a ship’s equipment store in the later half of the 19th century, but was covered up when the bank was built on top of it. The remains of Plimmer’s Ark are on display in the Old Bank Arcade today, but for a more animated approach to the history, one need only look up to the musical clock. Every hour on the hour the timepiece unfolds to reveal tiny vignettes depicting important moments in this site’s past. In one, little soldiers raise a British flag. In another, a cooper with barrels on a pier rocks back and forth along with a ship on the water, presumably mid-quake. The third shows Edwardian townspeople walking in front of the bank, while in the fourth construction workers dig in front of the same building. Throughout all of these, french horn music and a recorded narration score the show. The clock commemorates the history of the building, the ship, and the land surrounding, encouraging shoppers to stop for a moment to think about all that has happened in the place they stand.",mechanical instruments banks machines clocks shipwrecks ships shops
83,Abandoned WWII Structures of Motutapu Island,New Zealand,A network of fortifications that never saw conflict.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-wwii-structures-of-motutapu-island,"On the small island of Motutapu, a complex of bunkers, tunnels, and observation posts stands abandoned, leftover from the 1940s and preparations for an invasion that never came. In the language of New Zealand’s indigenous Māori people, the name Motutapu is derived from “Te Motu tapu a Taikehu,” the “sacred island of Taikehu” (a reference to a Māori ancestor). Located adjacent to the volcanic Rangitoto Island, it was a home and important site for centuries, and the Department of Conservation and the Motutapu Restoration Trust oversees a network of archaeological sites that date back to before an eruption that blanketed the island in ash 600 years ago. After the Japanese appeared to be making it further and further south during WWII, the New Zealand government focused on it for another reason: its strategic placement in Auckland Harbour. Fearing a potential Japanese assault, the government spent millions of dollars to build fortifications along the coastlines throughout New Zealand. Motutapu’s strategic position, however, led to extensive defenses and the placement of some of the country’s most advanced artillery. Today, many concrete structures remain nestled among the island’s national park and farmland. There are anti-aircraft gun emplacements, lookouts, communications and radar, and sleeping quarters. Dug into hills, some are signposted and indicated on maps, while others require a keen eye and adventure to find.  Be sure to respect the island's sacred status and pack out what you pack in. The island is also pest-free—the result of extensive ecological and conservation efforts—so follow regulations such as only bringing food in sealed containers. When visiting the island, take the ferry from Auckland to Motutapu. This will take you to Home Bay, where the paths to the fortifications begin. Be sure to take navigation equipment and/or a map. A visit can be a day trip, or there are campsites that can can booked through New Zealand's Department of Conservation.",war military history world war ii islands abandoned military
84,Toothbrush Fence,"Te Pahu, New Zealand",Hundreds of toothbrushes hang from a wire fence along a quiet New Zealand road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/toothbrush-fence,"In 2006, local eccentric Graeme Cairns began hanging toothbrushes from a fence along a quiet rural road that runs through the green and rolling landscapes near Te Pahu, New Zealand. Friends and neighbors joined in the fun, and soon even the Prime Minister of New Zealand had her toothbrush hanging in the wind alongside hundreds more. It’s safe to say that Graeme Cairns is an unconventional man. As the self-proclaimed Laird of Hamilton, a member of the McGillicuddy Serious Party, and a member of the Big Muffin Serious Band, he’s definitely pushed the boundaries of staid normality. So too with his 2006 project: the creation of a toothbrush-strewn fence in the heart of cow country about 12 miles from Hamilton, New Zealand. The fence began with a collection of toothbrushes previously gathered by Cairns. At the time, he told the Waikato Times: “All we need to do is add a few more hundred toothbrushes and people will flock from all over the world to see it, I’m sure.” He also compared toothbrushes to tropical fish, as they “come in a bewildering range of colors and shapes.” So he strung up his collection along the fence, and the locals thought “Well, why not?” Soon there were 50 more toothbrushes along the roadside. Not only toothbrushes, but kitchen brushes, electric toothbrushes, and a toilet brush were added. Toothbrushes have since been left by domestic and foreign tourists, as well as a handful of celebrities, most notably New Zealand’s former Prime Minister Helen Clark. The fence hit the big time in 2007, at least among discerning comedy fans, when it was mentioned in the second episode of the HBO comedy series Flight of the Conchords. The episode, “Bret Gives Up the Dream,” features a scene in which two of the central characters are working at a promotional stand for tourism in New Zealand. “Come to New Zealand,” says Murray as he tries to hand out flyers, “It’s like Lord of The Rings. We’ve got interesting attractions: a toothbrush fence, imagine that, a whole fence made out of toothbrushes!” In 2014, a five-meter section of the toothbrush fence was torn up when a car lost control during a high-speed police chase. The fleeing suspect plowed into the fence, uprooting it and the hundreds of toothbrushes innocently hanging from its horizontal wires. The community soon rallied around, however, and the toothbrush fence was returned to its former glory within a week. The toothbrush fence is located along Limeworks Loop Road, Te Pahu, near Hamilton, New Zealand. Don’t forget your toothbrush so you can hang it up with the rest.",fences local history tradition
85,Jellyfish Lake,"Koror, Palau",An isolated dive site teeming with cnidarians.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jellyfish-lake,"Located on an uninhabited rock island off the coast of Koror in Palau, Jellyfish Lake is one of 70 saltwater lakes on this South Pacific archipelago that were once connected to the ocean, but are now cut off. The isolated lakes became the perfect setting for a jellyfish explosion, which some speculate were trapped in the lake 12,000 years ago after a rise in sea levels post-Ice Age. The jellyfish, which munch on algae and have no natural predators present, fill the little lake. Though the jellyfish do have stingers, they are too small to be felt by humans. You can swim in the lake, but you can’t scuba dive, as that may disturb the delicate ecosystem. The lake is stratified into two layers, the upper one being richer with oxygen and less saline, and it’s a more suitable environment for organisms like jellyfish, copepods, and some species of fish. Also, you will want to stay away from the lower dangerous layer of hydrogen sulfide that hovers between 15 and 20 meters deep. During the day, the jellyfish migrate from the west side to the east side of the lake to follow the path of the sun, which feeds the algae they survive on.  Trips have been temporarily discontinued due to environmental conditions.",underwater week lakes water animals
86,Badrulchau Stone Monoliths,Palau,These ancient monoliths make up one of the largest archaeological sites in Palau.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/badrulchau-stone-monoliths,"Possibly the largest and oldest archaeological site in Palau, the Badrulchau Stone Monoliths can be found on the hill slopes at the northernmost point of Babeldaob Island. The site consists of 52 basalt megaliths lined up in two rows, crude faces carved into some of them. Archaeologists estimate its construction dates back to around the year 161. The purposes of these stone monuments have been a question, but it is believed that they served as pillars for a bai, a type of traditional Palauan meeting-house. According to legends, this bai was constructed by the gods and could house thousands of people at one time. If that is the case, the monoliths may be the remains of the largest bai ever built. If you’re fond of Pacific history, archaeological mysteries, and a spectacular view of the sea, you will enjoy this hidden treasure of ruins.  Badrulchau is located in Ngarchelong State on Babeldaob Island.

87,Talasea Airstrip,"Talasea, Papua New Guinea",Two World War II aircraft lie within the jungle around this abandoned runway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/talasea-airstrip,"The South Pacific is littered with relics leftover from World War II. Military tunnels snake beneath tiny towns. Planes and equipment lie sunken beneath the water, cloaked in coral. Dense tangles of jungle hold more forgotten wartime treasures, like this abandoned airfield. Originally built by the Australian army as a small landing strip, Talasea was occupied by both the Japanese and Americans during the second World War, changing hands between them. Too small to accommodate fighter planes, the airfield was used as an emergency landing strip in the later part of the war. In early September 1944, the landing strip saw its final pieces of action. On September 3, 1944, an American B-25H bomber took off from Stirling Island with the objective of locating and destroying any remaining Japanese ships of the South Coast of New Britain. While the mission was a success, the B-25H aircraft incurred engine trouble, and rather than risk the flight back to its base, the captain made the decision to make an emergency landing at Talasea. In a similar mission less than a week later, a Lockheed Ventura was dispatched to bomb a Japanese-occupied airstrip near Rabaul. The Lockheed’s mission was successful, but one engine failed on the return journey. As the crew knew the plane wouldn’t make it all the way back to base, they too made the decision to land at Talasea. Shortly after the war ended, the airstrip at Talasea was abandoned. Palm oil plantations sprung up around Talasea in the 1960s, and nature gradually encroached around the planes. Today, the airstrip is virtually unrecognizable from its former runway glory. The land still holds tidbits of its wartime past, however, as both the B-25 bomber and Lockheed remain in their final resting places. While exploring on foot, make your way through the overgrown bush, and you’ll reach the B-25H bomber, resting on its undercarriage atop a bed of lush greenery. Fewer than 40 yards to the west lies the Lockheed Ventura. With the Allied star still barely visible on its side, you can still walk inside the plant-filled undercarriage and imagine the tight spaces where the pilots and crew would have sat.  Only reachable by 4x4 vehicle, there is nothing more than a cutaway path through the forest that takes you high up onto the incline that was once the landing strip. Land tours to the planes are available from Walindi Plantation Resort.",airports aircraft airplanes military history war history world war ii abandoned military
88,The Tunnels of Rabaul,"Rabaul, Papua New Guinea",This volcanically volatile island town is home to an abandoned series of tunnels left by the Japanese during WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tunnels-of-rabaul-rabaul-papua-new-guinea,"Home to two active volcanoes and some of the most abundant earthquake activity in the world, the township of Rabaul in Papua New Guinea does not seem to be the ideal place for a massive military encampment. But thanks to a strategically significant harbor, the Japanese built one anyway during World War II, leaving behind over 500 miles of tunnels snaking beneath the island when they were routed. Japanese forces overtook the town of Rabaul in 1942 as WWII was in its final years, and quickly established a massive military complex serving their navy, air force, and, infantry. At its height, the Rabaul base and its surrounding encampment served over 97,000 soldiers and thousands more accompanying personnel. Due to the island’s remote location, the main threat to the base was bombardment from the air, which was frequent and often devastating. To counteract this, hundreds of miles of tunnels were built beneath the town where a number of fully functioning facilities were installed. The tunnels were dug by laborers who were captured in Malaysia, China, and Singapore and transported to Rabaul. Many of these laborers died from disease, starvation, poor treatment, and overwork. The Japanese also used local Tolai labor from surrounding villages and prisoners of war. The hospital, barracks, storehouses, and command centers were moved into the underground labyrinth with some of the chambers built as large as four stories tall. Some of the tunnels were hewn right from the existing rock, and some were crude structures supported by palm beams, while others still were fully built out concrete bunkers. All in all, the system became one of the longest and most elaborate in the world. When the Japanese were driven from the island at the end of the war, the base and its copious tunnels were simply left behind. Today, most of the contents of the base have been cleared out but dangerous ammunition and other remnants can still be found in the depths of the tunnels. A volcanic eruption in 1994 nearly buried the entire city beneath volcanic ash and most of the populace were forced to evacuate, but the area is slowly recovering and the tunnels beneath the island are slowly being rediscovered.",volcanoes tunnels military history subterranean sites world war ii islands geology military

Settled in 1790 by a mix of Tahitian islanders and the crew of the famous hijacked ship the H.M.S. Bounty, Pitcairn Island is home to a small population who carve out a living on the small volcanic island. Christian’s bar is the weekly social hall.   Due to the island’s historic moral laws, which previously required a permit to purchase or consume alcohol, Christian’s Cafe actually only began serving alcohol freely after 2009. Since the prohibitions on the island have been relaxed to encourage tourism, the lone cafe bar sees travelers on ten-day or three-day passes and even some guests from passing cruise ships.The establishment itself is a large, white room with a gorgeous view of Pitcairn’s lush tropical foliage, providing a relaxing atmosphere in which to imbibe with the locals. The island has only 50 aging inhabitants and very little import of goods, so the bar hours are kept relatively short, opening only after 6:30pm on Fridays, but if you can find a way to make it to the island it is your best bet for mixing it up with the historic island’s locals.",Unique Restaurants & Bars

The men of HMS Bounty, sent from England in search of breadfruit two years earlier, were tired, they were sick of Bligh’s tough command style, and mostly, they really, really wanted to go back to Tahiti. 18 men overpowered the captain, threatened his life, and set him adrift on a small boat with 18 loyal men. There began one of the most extraordinary stories of seafaring endurance and survival, in which Bligh and his men, powered perhaps by a desire for righteous revenge, navigated 3,618 nautical miles over 47 days and arrived in Timor to report the mutiny. Only one man did not make it - a sailor by the name of John Norton was stoned to death by natives during an unsuccessful attempt to make landfall for provisions on the remote Tofua Island. Meanwhile, the mutineers set out to establish their life of ease on Tubuai, Tahiti, and Pitcairn Islands with their new native wives. In fear of detection, after settling on Pitcairn Island,  the mutineers burned the Bounty in the water, effectively trapping themselves in their new island paradise. What followed was anything but an idyllic life. The men fought and squabbled and succumbed to disease, they committed suicide, and they killed each other in cold blood. Eighteen years later, when Pitcairn and the mutineers were discovered by the ship Topaz, only one of the men was still alive. In 1957, photographer and explorer Luis Marden made the extraordinary discovery of the remains of the Bounty, still visible in shallow water off the shores of Pitcairn, more or less undisturbed for a century and a half. Although some artifacts from the wreck were removed, there are still remains that can be seen by divers willing to risk the dangerous swells of the bay. Other artifacts are on display at the community hall on Pitcairn. Elsewhere, you can pay your respects to Captain Bligh in London, where his tomb is topped with a carving of breadfruit.",shipwrecks ships islands water ruins

The To Sua ocean trench is a swimmer’s delight, set on the edge of a tropical paradise with the South Pacific lapping at its shores. Surrounded by lush gardens, visitors wind along cliffside paths to the natural salt water pool sunken deep into the earth. The western side of the ocean trench opens onto a small, sandy beach only accessible through a cave-like nook. Sheer rock faces of volcanic basalt disappear underfoot, leaving an epic ladder as the sole access point to the water below. Too impatient to descend slowly? While making a flying leap into the crystalline water may seem a poor choice, at 90 feet in depth, the salt water pool offers a perfectly safe opportunity for those bold enough to give it a go. Should acts of bravado prove less appealing, paddling the turquoise waters of an ocean trench while humming Bali Hai will likely make for just as memorable an experience.

(You’ll sometimes hear them referred to as the Taga blowholes.) The Alofaaga blowholes and others like them developed thanks to lava flows that gradually carved out underwater caves. These sea caves grew upwards towards the land, until they became tunnels connecting the ocean to the rock face above. When water breaks against the seaward end of one of the Taga tunnels, it rushes into the tube, erupting through the hole above ground in a waterspout that may be as high as 20 meters, but is often much higher. The accompanying water pressure also causes a loud puffing sound, that punctuates each gush of seawater. Most of the land in Samoa is under customary ownership, in which land is owned by indigenous communities and administered under their jurisdiction. For this reason, the entrance to the blowholes is through the Taga village, and visitors pay a small fee to visit the natural wonder. First-time visitors may feel inclined to step back from the surging spray, but villagers have no such qualms. For another small fee, locals throw coconuts in the vent right before the big blow. The nuts rocket even higher than the water jet, easily reaching 100 feet. For the best show, come at high tide (and expect to get wet).  The Blowholes are open for viewing every day from 8 AM to 5 PM, except Sundays, when they are open from 12 PM to 5 PM.",underwater volcanoes natural wonders geology nature

This is the Pulemelei Mound — also known as the Tia Seu Ancient Mount — and nobody really knows when it was erected, or why it is there. With a base measuring 65 meters by 60 meters (213 feet by 197 feet), Pulemelei Mound consists of a foundational platform of volcanic rock supporting multiple layers of natural basalt stone, piled on top to a height of 12 meters (23 feet). The structure is pyramidal with flat top. Several purposes have been proposed for this structure, including use in religious ceremonies, as a lookout platform, or as a burial monument. It most likely served multiple functions, but in truth the reason for its construction and the role that it played remain unknown. Pulemelei Mount was most likely built sometime between 1100 and 1400 CE and remained active until 1700-1800, after which time it fell into disuse and was left to be reclaimed by the jungle. Although it is occasionally cleared of vegetation to reveal the details of its stone construction, the easily concealed structure is very quickly overgrown by the lush forest surrounding it once again, adding an additional degree of difficulty to the already tricky task of finding it. The site is located in Letolo Plantation, a short walk away from the road. The way is unmarked and can take some trial-and-error to find, and seeing a pyramid needs a bit of imagination if it has not been cleared up recently. Once there, however, you can see the ocean from the top, and the views are magnificent. It is a 40 minute walk from plantation via a forest footpath. Way to the mound is badly marked. Just before reaching to the place there is a sign on a tree showing way to a car park but there is no way of getting your car to that point.",pyramids lost wonders mystery ancient
94,Robert Louis Stevenson Museum,"Apia, Samoa",A museum now occupies the mansion in Samoa where the prolific Scottish writer chose to spend the last years of his life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/robert-louis-stevenson-museum,"Born in Edinburgh, Robert Louis Stevenson was diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child which, along with his nomadic nature, led him on a series of travels in search of a warmer climate later in life. After several European and North American locales, the writer settled on life across the world—in Samoa. The house he and his family built there is now a museum packed with many of the writer’s original belongings. Stevenson—by this point a bona fide literary celebrity—and his family set sail from San Francisco in 1888 and toured the Pacific for three years, spending time in Hawaii, Tahiti, the Gilbert Islands, New Zealand, Sydney, and Samoa. It was in the latter that Stevenson finally settled, purchasing 127-hectares in 1890 for his recuperative residence. The house they built—named “Villa Vailima,” after the nearby village—ultimately  included five bedrooms, a library, a ballroom, and the only fireplace in Samoa, as well as a grand piano, a tablecloth from Queen Victoria, and a Rodin nude given as a gift by the artist himself. Despite this rather grand home, Stevenson made fast friends with many locals. For his efforts in advocating for indigenous political interests, he earned the familiar nickname “Tusitala” from the locals, meaning “Teller of Tales.” Stevenson, author of Treasure Island and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, died in 1894 at age 44 and, per his wishes, was buried atop the nearby Mount Vaea. After his wife, Fanny, passed away twenty years later, her ashes were brought from California and interred beside her husband’s remains. In the years after their deaths, their home housed first German, then New Zealand, and finally Samoan diplomats once independence was achieved. Severely damaged by hurricanes in 1990 and 1991, the mansion was fully renovated and reopened as the Robert Louis Stevenson Museum in December of 1994, a full century after the writer’s death. Today, Stevenson’s family home is the most popular tourist attraction on the island of Samoa, although it may only see a few outside visitors each day. The staff run a guided tour of the home, which is kept as it looked at the time of Stevenson’s death. On fair weather days, visitors can also take a hike to the top of the hill and pay their respects at the author’s burial site.  From the waterfront, flag a taxi down and head for the Cross Island Road. Directions can be found on the official website.",pacific scotland mansions burial places literature islands museums

Malietoa, the first head of state to be a follower of the Baha’i faith, also dedicated the temple upon its completion in 1984. The temple was designed by Iranian-Canadian architect Hossein Amanat. As is required according to Baha’i scripture, the temple has a nine-sided circular shape. Like other Baha’i houses of worship around the world, the Samoan temple honors local cultural and environmental elements. The temple sits among 20 acres of prayer gardens comprised of over 60 species of plants, flowers, and tree, all native to Samoa.

While everyone aboard was safely evacuated, the ship began to list as it was brought into Roderick Bay, and the captain had no choice but to ground it, lest it sink entirely. The ship still rests there to this day and has become something of a tourist attraction. Several salvage companies have made attempts to retrieve the ship, but all found that it had already been ransacked by locals during the civil war the Solomon Islands endured.

97,Egg Fields of Savo Island,"Panueli, Solomon Islands",Megapodes incubate their eggs using the heat of an active volcano on this Pacific isle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/egg-fields-of-savo-island,"From Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, Savo Island is reached by a 30-minute boat ride across the Iron Bottom Sound—so named for the dozens of ships and planes that sank in it during World War II. The island is also home to an active, steaming volcano and bubbling hot springs. The heat attracts megapodes, chicken-sized black birds that utilize the warm environment to incubate their eggs. Accessing Savo’s volcano on foot takes about two hours, one way. The trek follows a path created by lava from the last eruption (which took place during the mid-19th century), surrounded by verdant jungle on either side. Hot springs and cold streams punctuate the path, but be careful: The water near the top is really, really hot. At dawn, megapodes lay and bury their eggs in the sandy fields around a village called Panueli. The volcanic earth keeps the eggs warm, so mother birds can simply fly off. Left unattended, the eggs become fair game for predators. Men from the village arrive, digging more than three feet down to unearth the birds’ nests. They work with their hands in order not to damage the large duck egg–sized treasures, then wrap the lot in banana leaves for safe keeping. Later in the day, women fill in the holes and level the sand. Villagers won’t kill megapodes for food, but they do collect eggs as a source of food and income. Each one is worth about $2. At one time, eggs were abundant in the sand fields around Panueli. But as of 2017, only one egg-laying field remains, and the yield is sparse. Over-harvesting has created an unsustainable environment for the megapodes, so all who visit should plan to bear witness to egg-laying at dawn, but to abstain from egg-snatching afterward.  While the villagers harvest the eggs for food and income, visitors should refrain from digging, trampling, or disrupting the megapodes' habitat.",yolk lore eggs endangered eats volcanoes geology
98,Hunga Ha'apai New Volcano Island,Tonga,Underwater volcanic eruption forms new island off the coast of Tonga.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hunga-ha-apai-new-volcano-island,"Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai is an underwater volcano off the coast of Tonga, just 62km (39 mi) northwest of the Tongan capital of Nuku’alofa. The volcano gets its name from the two small islands it’s nestled between, Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha’apai, and is part of the highly active Tonga-Kermadec Islands volcanic arc. The area, which is known to Tongans as the islands that “jump back and forth” from seismic activity, is also part of the highly volcanic Pacific Ring of Fire. It is thus believed that Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai is part of a cluster of 36 undersea volcanoes. In March of 2009, Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai erupted for several days, sending a violent stream of steam, rocks, and ash thousands of feet into the air. For days, huge columns of smoke and ash were seen rising from the Pacific ocean. Geologists confirmed that the eruption came from two volcanic vents, one that was located on Hunga Ha’apai, and another located 100m (330 ft) offshore. The two vents ejected so much debris, however, that they created a new landmass between them. Though the eruption wiped out all signs of wildlife on the original islet, the “new” island added hundreds of square meters to Hunga Ha’apai.",fiery wonders volcanoes islands natural wonders geology nature
99,Republic of Minerva,Tonga,"A failed utopia, shut down by a more legitimate nation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/republic-of-minerva,"Although many utopian societies seem doomed from the outset, the Republic of Minerva was up against a unique challenge: Creating a libertarian micronation on reclaimed reefs in the Pacific Ocean, when the land already had an owner. Situated 250 miles from Tonga, the Republic of Minerva was conceived by wealthy Nevada real estate mogul Michael Oliver. According to Oliver, his organization the Ocean Life Research Foundation had raised $100 million to create a utopian society on Pacific reefs. Oliver’s plan was to create a micro-nation without taxes, welfare or economic intervention, that lived chiefly off of tourism and fishing. In 1971, Minerva’s construction began by bringing barges of sand to the reefs to raise them out of the ocean. Oliver then led a conference of neighboring states in which he delcared his intentions, only to find out that Tonga had issued a claim over the land. At that point, Oliver and his organization jumped the gun a little bit. Ignoring other claims to Minerva, Oliver issued a declaration of independence and created a coin currency for his new nation and was all set to launch into his experiment in nation building. Unfortunately, the King of Tonga did not accept the new country’s legitimacy, and issued a document laying official claim to the reefs. Within months, representatives from Tonga made it clear they were in control of the reefs, and Oliver and his followers left without a fight. Since that time, a few other groups have tried to set up shop on the islands of Minerva, only to be rebuffed once again by the Tongan government. Almost all of the land brought to the reefs has since been reclaimed by the Pacific Ocean.",micro-nations

Each coral limestone slab weighs approximately 30 to 40 tons. Because of its clear resemblance, it has been nicknamed the “Stonehenge of the Pacific.” The name means “Maui’s Burden” in the local language, and as the stones are too heavy for humans to handle, it is believed that the god Maui himself brought them from ‘Uvea (Wallis Island) and constructed the monument. They now reside in a small roadside nature reserve. Archaeologists, on the other hand, generally seem to believe that the Ha‘amonga was built by an early 13th-century king as the gateway to his royal palace, Heketā. Otherwise, it has been suggested, it might have been used for astrological purposes. These theories are unconfirmed, however, and the origin of the huge trilithon remains a mystery.",megalithic standing stones islands
101,Funafuti Airport Airstrip,"Vaiaku, Tuvalu","With only one flight in and out a week, the unfenced runway at this small island's airport transforms into a seaside park for locals and visitors.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/funafuti-airport-unfenced-airstrip-park,"Despite its white sand beaches and lively coral reefs, Tuvalu is the least visited country in the world. That’s not particularly surprising when you consider there is only a single, weekly flight to and from the remote island every Tuesday. The other six days of the week, the runway at Funafuti International Airport transforms into a public park. The unfenced airstrip is a place for locals to lounge about and enjoy the island sun, typically in the early evening when the day’s temperatures have cooled. Touch football, soccer, and volleyball games are often underway, and residents will ride around the smooth tarmac on motorbikes. The tranquility is only interrupted once a week when a siren blares warning residents to clear the runway for an approaching flight. There used to be another weekly flight to and from the island on Thursdays, but that flight has since been suspended, likely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The U.S. Navy built the Funafuti Airport in 1943 during World War II. In November 1943, the airfield became the headquarters for a U.S. bomber unit fighting Japanese forces. By the summer of 1944, the U.S. had already begun withdrawing from the island as the fighting moved north, closer to Japan. By 1945, the U.S. Army had fully withdrawn from the island. Soon after the war, the military airfield was repurposed into a commercial airport. In October 1982, Tuvalu welcomed Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. They were the first royals to visit the island, arriving only five years after Tuvalu became a fully independent sovereign state within the Commonwealth.

102,Tuvalu Women’s Handicraft Centre,"Vaiaku, Tuvalu",Ancient weaving techniques are used to create these colorful souvenirs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuvalu-womens-handicraft-centre,"Right next to Tuvalu’s tiny airport is a small shop known as the Tuvalu Women’s Handicraft Centre. Lined with colorful handmade baskets, fans, necklaces, mats, fishhooks, and woodcarvings, the shop showcases the work of female artisans from the island nation. The shop is only open two days a week when flights land on the Funafuti Airport Airstrip. It is Tuvalu’s only souvenir shop. In Polynesia, it’s often the women who learn and pass down traditional techniques used to create such handicrafts. Polynesian woven goods populate almost every aspect of life on the islands and have been used to make sails, roofing, mattresses, and, of course, clothing. Today the same techniques are used to create everything from baskets to mats. Coconut palms, or kere, are used to make dancing costumes whereas butterfly pandanus, ie’ie, is used in basket weaving. Hibiscus plants, pūrau, are used more widely than either and are used to make everything from ropes, mats, sandals, and dancing skirts. Usually, weavers use the entirety of the plant—stems, veins, bark, leaves, and all—soaking the raw material, macerating it, and then soaking it again. Afterward, the plant material is smoothed, beaten, and dried to get the light tan color used in many of the woven crafts. Natural dyes are also sometimes used to create colorful patterns in the finished weavings. Sometimes whole leaves are sewn into skirts as well, mixing woven patterns with raw plant material. Traditional woven dance costumes often demonstrate as much artistry and skill as Tuvaluan dances themselves. Dance skirts, known as titi, combine many materials. Today finished costumes combine natural materials like leaves and seeds with imported cloth and beads. Sometimes elaborate geometric designs are sewn onto pandanus leaves covered in white cloth which are then attached to the skirts. The colors used in the costumes sometimes serve to demonstrate the status of the dancer or if they’re a part of a certain village, school or church. Titi are usually worn over a fabric dress and are accessorized with wristbands, a headband, and armbands. These costumes are worn during traditional Tuvaluan dances like the Fatele Nukulaelae.  There are very limited flights in and out of Tuvalu. Be sure to do your research before traveling here. The Tuvalu Womens' Handicraft Centre is only open on days when flights go in and out of the tiny airport.

Never fear; Vanuatu Post has you covered. One of the world’s only underwater post offices can be found off of Mele, Vanuatu, which hosts the Hideaway Island resort, a vacation spot specializing in scuba and snorkeling. It’s a fully functional post office, which means it also comes with the irritations of a regular post office. It’s only open during certain hours, which are signaled by a flag raised above a float over the post office. You may arrive to find it closed, in which case you must take your mail back with you—no dropping it off. Fortunately, though, you most likely won’t have to wait in line. And of course, because water would ruin any traditional postcards, scuba divers must purchase waterproof postcards and stamps and have them embossed on land rather than writing in ink.

104,Mount Yasur,Vanuatu,This South Pacific volcano has been blowing its stack for over 800 years and is said to be home to a cult leader waiting to be reborn.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-yasur,"Dominating the silhouette of Tanna Island in the South Pacific is a mighty vulcan mountain of Yasur that, despite having spat fire into the heavens continuously for over 800 years, is surprisingly welcome to sightseers and visitors. Daring travelers hoping to see a little action while in the Republic of Vanuatu would be hard-pressed to find a more active locale than Yasur Mountain. The volcano is a continuous hotspot of magma activity, spitting molten rock into the air above its caldera continuously for centuries. Unlike many active volcanoes, the summit of Yasur is approachable on foot by anyone daring enough to try, becoming a major attraction on the tiny island. The mountain has become sacred to many of the locals who subscribe to the cargo cult based around the enigmatic man-god John Frum. The figure of John Frum is shrouded in mystery, some saying he is a white American serviceman, while others have described him as a black man in a local dress. No matter his true form, to those who believe that he will lead them into a brighter future, he is a god. According to some, John Frum actually lives inside of Yasur Mountain, simply waiting to be reborn. While it is unlikely that an enigmatic miracle man is living in a state of flaming un-death deep inside the volcano, the fires of Yasur Mountain are nonetheless awe-inspiring.

105,Million Dollar Point,"Luganville, Vanuatu","The U.S. military dumped millions dollars worth of goods off a beach in Vanuatu, purely to spite the British and French.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/million-dollar-point,"When the United States military abandoned the Vanuatuan island of Espiritu Santo after occupying it as a base during World War II, it left behind infrastructure works such as roads, buildings and runways. But its oddest legacy might be the millions of dollars of goods it dumped into the ocean—just so the French and British couldn’t have them. Today, off the shore of what’s been dubbed “Million Dollar Point” in the Pacific Ocean, snorkelers and scuba divers encounter a surprising sight: a fortune’s worth of military tanks, guns and jeeps resting beneath the waves. Espiritu Santo, an island in the Vanuatu archipelago, was established as a military supply base, naval harbor and airfield after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the U.S. used it as the launch site for its attack on the Japanese in the Pacific. At the time, parts of Vanuatu were still under British and French colonization. When America left the military base after the war, the remaining goods—everything from weaponry to bottles of Coca-Cola—were offered to the French and British at a very low price, 6 cents to the dollar. However, the colonizers were going on the assumption that should they refuse to buy the items, the U.S. military would be forced to simply leave them behind for free. The Americans were having none of this. To spite the British and French, the military made the rash decision to drive all of the vehicles, food, clothing, drinks, and other equipment to a wharf on the southern coast of the island. The army then drove all of the vehicles into the sea, used bulldozers to dump the rest of the supplies over the wharf, before also driving the bulldozers into the sea, ensuring that the European countries would not be able to get their hands on the items at all, free or otherwise. Millions of dollars worth of goods were completely destroyed over the period of those two days, rendered unusable at the bottom of the ocean. As a result of the dumping, the waters were contaminated with fuel, rubber, metal and other waste, leaving the local Vanuatuans shocked at the carnage, though they salvaged what they could once the Americans had finally departed. Today, you can make your way to Million Dollar Point and take a snorkel or scuba dive through the wreckage, should you desire to swim through this odd memorial to political spite.

106,Ambrym Island,"Malampa Province, Vanuatu",Plains of ash and pair of semi-active volcanoes contribute to the otherworldly beauty of this little-known Vanuatu island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ambrym-island,"If you ask around about volcanoes in Vanuatu you will inevitably be steered towards Tanna Island and the expensive package deals that every tour shop in town sells. They’ll promise you a night at a resort and an easy 20-minute walk up the side of a volcano to see the fireworks. But those who prefer the road less travelled might find their way to Ambrym Island, where the challenging hike through the tropical forest takes 4 to 6 hours, accommodation is in tents or huts built by local villagers, and the food is whatever your guide catches on the way up to the camp site. The centre of Ambrym is dotted with a pair of volcanoes, Maroum and Benbo, but it is less popular than Tanna because they don’t produce such a flashy display. Maroum volcano is a roaring cauldron which produces “Pele’s Hair,” fine strands of volcanic glass which coat the ground around the crater. They are said to occasionally form fragile glass “hairballs” that, in the right wind, can be seen blowing up from the crater. Maroum is also reputed to the site of animal sacrifices – dropping a white chicken into the crater helps escape bad luck. Benbow is a more hazardous journey, and the crater must be entered via a rope to see the lava. The ash plains that lie between Maroum and Benbow are stunning in their own right, but can only be crossed with a guide. Black ash, tinted orange with sulphur from the volcanoes, they become on an eerie sight when wisps of smoke and cloud float through. Different parts of the island have different stories about how the series of volcanoes came to be. One story is that a group were visiting family on the other side of the island, and crossing over left some laplap cooking under coals in the centre of the island. On their return through the forest the laplap had been consumed by the earth, and a volcano erupted the next day. Visiting Ambrym requires more cultural respect than the usual tourist expedition. Visitors must book in advance and can only visit the volcanoes with a local guide. Guides are enthusiastic about sharing stories about their history and their way of life, but they are new to tourism, and there’s a sense that too much attention could upset a delicate balance between maintaining cultural ties and becoming yet another commercialized tourist trap.

107,Amelbati Cannibal Site,"Walarano, Vanuatu",Nestled in the jungles of Vanuatu are the remains of what was once a cannibal oven.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amelbati-cannibal-site,"Surrounded by coconut palms and cacao trees, today these lush grounds in the tiny South Pacific nation of Vanuatu (which is made up of 83 small islands) are eerily quiet. But once upon a time, they were the religious grounds of the Amelbati tribe, which practiced cannibalism. The Vanuatu islands first had contact with Europeans in 1606, but Malekula was isolated and little visited by Europeans until well into the 20th century. As a result, the island’s Indigenous traditions were better preserved there than elsewhere in Vanuatu. This site of former cannibal ceremonies is a 30-minute uphill trek from Walarano village on Malekula. Called a nasara, this sacred ground is also where the Amelbati tribe buried their chiefs. The Amelbati are a subset of the Small Nambas clan. A namba is a woven penis sheath traditionally worn by adult males in Vanuatu. The size of the leaf used in the sheaths differentiates Malekula’s population into two distinct groups comprised of many tribes: the Big Nambas and the Small Nambas. The nasara formed the epicenter of the community. Here the tribe performed all their important ceremonies and rituals. The nasara is roughly broken into four “rooms:” the ceremonial performance space, the courtroom where judges determined captives’ fates, the kitchen where human flesh was cooked, and the cemetery of past chiefs, which includes their memorial stones, skulls, bones, and conch shell trumpets. The site was abandoned when the population moved to the nearby islands of Rano and Wala. According to one Vanuatu man, the process of making human flesh edible was time tested and precise: First, our ancestors would dig a hole in the ground like this. They’d put hot stones in the hole, then cut up the person into pieces and put those on top. They’d add in some yams and taro, put in some more hot rocks, and cover it all over with banana leaves to keep the steam in. Standard baking time for the underground oven was three to five hours. And the chief of the village always got to eat the victim’s head. We’d kill and eat people who stole our women or came to fight us, but we don’t do that anymore. We feel very sorry for those people now. The last reported cannibalism on Malekula Island took place in 1969. Today, the people who live in this isolated paradise are decidedly friendly and hospitable to tourists.",cannibals indigenous islands cemeteries nature

The men climb to the top of these towers, attach two long elastic vines to their ankles, announce to the world their most intimate (and occasionally last) thoughts and then leap.
