0,Österreichische Nationalbibliothek (Austrian National Library),"Vienna, Austria",The beautiful baroque library of the Hapsburg empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/osterreichische-nationalbibliothek,"The Österreichische Nationalbibliothek (Austrian National Library) is a breathtaking baroque masterpiece, finished in 1726. Formerly the court library to the Hapsburgs, it is one of the world’s major libraries, with an extraordinary collection that dates back to the 14th century. The current collection contains around 2.5 million books. Visitors can visit many special collections in addition to the main halls, which include prints, maps, papyri, portraits, music, and theater. But the magnificent library itself is the focal point here. Among the exhibitions are two exquisite Venetian baroque globes — one for the Earth and one for the sky, each with a diameter of more than one meter.

1,Stephansdom Crypt,"Vienna, Austria",The crypt of the imposing Stephensdom holds royal intestines and thousands of skeletons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stephansdom-crypt,"In the middle of Vienna, the dark and imposing St. Stephen’s Cathedral (Stephansdom) draws thousands of tourists to gaze at the grand architecture. But there is something to be seen below as well: just beneath the stone floors lie the skeletal remains of over 11,000 people. Surprisingly few visitors opt to enter the crypt. The entrance to the underground tomb is hidden in plain sight, as an innocuous staircase on the left side of the main floor. The vast Stephansdom crypt is divided into a number of smaller crypts and catacombs, and is still an active burial spot. The last tenant to move in was Franz Cardinal König, the archbishop of Vienna, who was laid to rest there in 2004. Most of the bodies of the Habsburg royalty are interred nearby in the Imperial Crypt on Neuer Markt square. In another section, known as the ducal crypt, the organs of princes, queens, and emperors are kept. Along with some bodies and hearts, over 60 jars of imperial intestines rest in the ducal crypt, including one containing Empress Maria Theresia’­s sovereign stomach. Not long ago, the seals on one jar broke, leaking 200-year-old visceral fluid onto the floor. The stink was apparently so awful that it took a day or two before someone was willing to go down and address the situation. In 1735, Vienna experienced an outbreak of the bubonic plague. In an effort to keep the Black Death at bay, the numerous cemeteries surrounding the Stephansdom and the charnel house (a building for storing stacked bones) were emptied, and thousands of bones and rotting corpses were thrown down into the pits dug in the floor of the crypt. The downside to this arrangement was that the smell of the catacombs would occasionally waft up into the church and make religious services impossible. To combat the unfortunate smell, as well as make room for more bodies, a few unlucky prisoners were lowered into the pits where they were forced to scrub the rotting flesh off the plague-ridden and disordered bodies, snapping and breaking the skeletons down to individual bones, and stacking them into neatly ordered rows, skulls on top. It seems that they never finished the job–to this day, one can still find sections of the crypt scattered with piles of disorganized bones and deteriorating coffins. Guided tours only. On special occasions like “die lange Nacht der Kirche” (“the long night of churches,” a yearly event), the crypt is open to the public. Inside the Cathedral, meet at the stairs to the catacombs, which are on the left side near the back as you enter the church.",hapsburgs memento mori catacombs and crypts eccentric homes subterranean sites homes churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
2,Habsburg Imperial Crypt,"Vienna, Austria",The final resting place for the remains of 143 Habsburg royalty.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hapsburg-imperial-crypt-vienna,"Habsburg funerals were elaborate affairs. Death loomed large in the cultural life of the Viennese for centuries, celebrated in song, poetry, and artwork. Macabre memento-mori sculptures, designed to inspire piety, can be spotted throughout the city. The death of an emperor or empress was a major event. As one of the major imperial royal dynasties of Europe, as well as the Holy Roman Emperors from 1438 to 1740, the Habsburgs ruled over much of Europe until their downfall in World War I. For many Habsburg monarchs their death meant not only the creation of an elaborate and beautiful sarcophagus for the Imperial Crypt, but also a silver urn to preserve their heart and reliquaries to contain their embalmed entrails. After the funeral, the parts of the deceased would part ways, to be interred in three separate holy crypts. Twelve emperors, 18 empresses, and 113 other members of the Habsburg family are interred in the Imperial Crypt (Kaisergruft) in Vienna. The crypt, also known in German as the Kapuzinergruft (“Capuchins’ Crypt”), holds 105 metal sarcophagi, the most elaborate of them designed by the royal sculptor Balthasar Ferdinand Moll. The Rococo double sarcophagus of Emperor Franz Stephan and his wife Empress Maria Theresa is considered his masterpiece. The royal couple lie on top of the tomb, surrounded by elaborate reliefs illustrating scenes from their lives. The hearts of 54 members of the royal family are held in special urns in the Herzgruft, or “Heart Room,” located a few blocks away in St. George’s Chapel of the Augustinerkirche, and the embalmed entrails of princes, queens and emperors are kept in the Ducal Crypt below the St. Stephen’s Cathedral (Stephansdom). The Imperial Crypt below the Capuchin Church and monastery was originally intended to hold only the remains of Empress Anna and Emperor Matthias, who died in 1618 and 1619. The crypt was expanded many times over the centuries to accommodate more royal remains: first in 1657 by Emperor Leopold I, again in 1754 by his daughter the Empress Maria Theresa, then again in 1908 by Emperor Franz Joseph. The buildings were restored more recently in the 1960s. Emperor Franz Joseph’s sarcophagus is the only one made from stone instead of metal. It is flanked by the coffins of his wife Elisabeth and son Rudolf. It was Rudolf’s mysterious and tragic suicide (after murdering his 17-year-old mistress) in 1889 that began the downward trajectory of the Habsburg Empire. Because Rudolf left no male heir, the crown was passed from Franz Joseph to his nephew, Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination in 1914 tipped off World War I. Charles I, Franz Ferdinand’s heir, became the last emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Neither Franz Ferdinand nor Charles, however, is interred in the Imperial Crypt. Franz Ferdinand is interred with his wife Sophie in Artstetten Castle, Austria. Charles is interred with his wife Zita in the Church of Our Lady of Monte, in Madeira, and their hearts are held at the Loreto Chapel of Muri Abbey in Italy. Archduke Otto, the last Crown Prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was interred in the Imperial Crypt following his death on July 4th, 2011. He is the last Habsburg to be interred there.

3,Schmetterlinghaus: The Imperial Butterfly Park,"Vienna, Austria",A tropical paradise just a short trip from the opera house is filled with beautiful winged creatures.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/schmetterlinghaus-imperial-butterfly-park,"Built around the turn of the last century and part of the Hofburg palace, this “Jugendstil” or Art Nouveau greenhouse is filled with a lush, tropical landscape, trickling waterfalls, and within its humid walls you will be treated to its delicate inhabitants - the butterflies. Peeking into hollow trees and up among the branches, you can watch the graceful favorites of the bug world flitter and fly, or softly rest and pulse their exotic wings, possibly on your outstretched finger. A closer look could very well uncover cocoons, or you may even catch a hatching. The butterfly house offers two levels from which to seek sights of the colorful flyers. A short film at the end of your walk though the butterfly habitat will give you some scientific insight on the ethereal creatures you just enjoyed inside the tropical forest in the center of a city.  As of June 2021, the butterfly house requires a negative COVID-19 test or immunization card to enter.

With around 1,000 clocks in the “Uhrenmuseum,” there is much to see. Of particular note is the 230-year-old astronomical clock, constructed by an Augustinian friar. Built in 1679, and calibrated up to the year 9999, it is a gorgeous piece of engineering. With layers upon layers of golden gears, and over 30 readings and dials, it is stunning. Each hand takes 20,000 years to revolve. It’s all arranged in chronological order, from ornate pocket watches, to a 15th-century tower clock, to sundials, to rare Japanese pillar clocks, to grandfather clocks, to Black Forest cuckoo clocks, to a huge clock organ (unfortunately not working at the time of this writing).

5,Kriminalmuseum,"Vienna, Austria",Macabre museum devoted to historical Viennese murders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kriminalmuseum,"Skulls, medieval torture devices, bloody gloves, depictions of murder, death masks, and rusty axes - the Kriminalmuseum in Vienna, Austria is not for the faint of heart. The Kriminalmuseum or Criminal museum follows crime, punishment and murder from the Middle Ages right up to the present day. It is housed in one of the oldest buildings in the Leopoldstadt area, the “Seifensiederhaus,” or “Soap Boilers House,” and dates back to 1685. Twenty rooms of this 324 year old home are devoted to this surprisingly large and very morbid museum about crime and murder. Of course the Kriminalmuseum is about more than just murder. There are cases devoted to counterfeit money, lock picking, brothels, and police investigation. But mostly, images of crime scenes, murder weapons and the skulls of both murderers and their victims fill the space. While macabre, the museum has a fascinating and somewhat mysterious quality to it. For non-German speakers there is a further air of mystery: the informational signs and grisly newspaper articles are all in German. Though sometimes, in the Kriminalmuseum, it is better not to know.",crime and punishment
6,Karlskirche (St. Charles's Church),"Vienna, Austria","Built to give thanks for the passing of a plague epidemic, this cathedral is a one-of-a-kind architectural hybrid.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karlskirche-st-charles-church,"The Karlskirche cathedral is a unique architectural curiosity, a mix of ancient Greek and Roman elements with Byzantine, Renaissance, and Baroque styles. Commissioned by the Habsburg Imperial Court to fulfill a religious vow, its symbolic details also sought to bolster Vienna’s historic claim as the temporal center of Christendom. In the early 18th century, Central Europe was hit by the last great outbreak of the Black Plague. Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI made a vow to build a church dedicated to St. Carlo Borromeo—revered for attending to Milanese plague victims in the 16th century, and the emperor’s namesake—if the city was saved. After the plague passed, the new church was officially announced in 1713. The church was designed by court architect Johann Bernard Fischer von Erlach, whose Baroque architecture profoundly influenced and shaped the tastes of the Habsburg Empire. Von Erlach’s ambitious design is centered around a portico in the Ancient Greek temple style, flanked by two columns modeled after Trajan’s Column in Rome. The twin columns reference Solomon’s Temple as well as the Pillars of Hercules (a symbol adopted by Charles V to represent the Holy Roman Empire), and are together reminiscent of the Pantheon of antiquity. The columns feature reliefs crafted by the Italian sculptor Lorenzo Mattielli, and depict scenes from the life St. Borromeo. The dome recalls that of St. Peter’s Basilica, but is remarkably different in that the base is an elongated ellipsoid. At the main altar, a scene portrays the ascension of St. Borromeo. Above the sculpture group, a circle of angels and sun rays is arrayed in front of a source of light, echoing a similar design found in St. Peter’s Basilica. The fresco of the dome was painted by Johann Michael Rottmayr of Salzburg and Gaetano Fanti of Bologna, and displays an intercession of St. Borromeo—supported by the Virgin Mary—pleading to the Holy Trinity to end the plague in Vienna.",plague churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
7,The Narrenturm,"Vienna, Austria",This former insane asylum now holds a pathological anatomy museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/narrenturm,"Meaning “Fools’ Tower,” the Narrenturm was one of the first insane asylums ever built. Today the Narrenturm no longer holds mentally imbalanced Viennese, but it does contain something else of interest: The Anatomical-Pathological Museum. While the circular building (known by locals as “the poundcake”) houses only a small percent of the museum’s total collection, it contains some fascinating pieces. Syphilitic skulls that resemble Swiss cheese, jars of disfigured fetuses, and graphic wax displays of untreated STDs all peer out at you from the old cells. It also contains a recreated wonder cabinet, complete with a narwhal tusk and taxidermied monkeys. Keep your eyes open for the Hydrocephalic skeleton, towards the end of the museum. His enormous head is hard to miss. Update August 2017: The building is undergoing a major renovation and much of the collection has been moved into storage.

8,The Lost Garden of Schloss Schonbrunn,"Vienna, Austria",The topiary maze at the Habsburg hunting lodge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lost-garden-schloss-schonbrunn,"Schloss Schonbrunn, in Vienna, is the ridiculously resplendent former hunting lodge and summer palace of the Habsburgs. The palace is, of course, massive and ornate. But one of the most delightful features is surely the Irrgarten, or “lost garden,” otherwise known as a topiary maze. The original maze was demolished in 1892, for courtiers, royalty and various ladies of the court were meeting in the center of the maze and “disreputable encounters” were taking place. It was rebuilt in 1999 following the design of the original maze from 1686, and is surprisingly challenging to navigate.",topiary mazes gardens plants
9,Republic of Kugelmugel,"Vienna, Austria","A spherical ""micro-nation"" in the heart of Vienna.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/republic-kugelmugel,"The Republic of Kugelmugel (roughly, “spherical hill”) was originally constructed by the artist Edwin Lipburger and his son Nikolaus Lipburger in 1971, in a small Austrian town called Katzelsdorf. The building has 7.68 m in diameter and is constructed of timber blocks covered with zinc sheets. At first, it served as a painter’s atelier. But after some time local authorities informed the Lipburgers that spherical buildings were not allowed. In an attempt to protect their creation from being demolished, the Lipburgers created their own Kugelmugel township, complete with self-made street signs surrounding the sphere. Later, as the legal dispute escalated, Edwin Lipburger attempted to declare the structure as its own federal state, the Republic of Kugelmugel, even going so far as to issue his own stamps and currency and refusing to pay taxes. The elder Lipburger was eventually sent to jail, for 10 weeks in 1979, for the offense of putting up unapproved street signs. The key to understanding Kugelmugel is that it was founded as a “republic” both as an artistic intervention and in order to protect the spherical house from being demolished. As an act of resistance, it earned quite a few fans. In the early 1980s, Austria’s culture minister, Helmuth Zilk, suggested Kugelmugel be moved to the Vienna Prater amusement park. The Lipburgers went along with the idea, having been promised access to tap water, electricity, and sewers. But these facilities were never provided, which resulted in a long-lasting dispute with the city of Vienna. Edwin Lipburger died in 2015, but Kugelmugel still sits in Vienna Prater, enclosed in barbed wire. A proud “micronation,” it counts about 600 people as citizens, though their citizenship is enjoyed from afar.  Kugelmugel is located in Vienna's famous Prater park. Today it is mostly a gallery space that's open to the public for exhibitions and performances several times a year.",spheres micro-nations outsider architecture
10,Palmenhaus,"Vienna, Austria",Dine amidst exotic plants at this former royal greenhouse.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palmenhaus-austrian-greenhouse-restaurant,"In Vienna, plants and humans can sit side by side and enjoy the sunlight, high ceilings, and dazzling views of the royal gardens. Formerly a greenhouse built for Austrian emperors, Palmenhaus now serves as a cafe, bar, and lounge where folks can dine amidst exotic flora. The first iteration of the greenhouse was built in 1822, overlooking the expansive Hofburg palace gardens. Nearly 80 years later, Austrian architect Friedrich Ohmann built the extravagant, steel-and-glass Jugendstil structure that still stands today. After a multimillion dollar renovation in 1998, the building now boasts more than 22,000 square feet of magnificent flora, food, and even a bunch of butterflies. (You’ll find them in the Schmetterlingshaus, or “House of Butterflies.”) Want to dine al fresco? You can venture out onto the Burggarten, a vast patio overlooking the former emperor’s gardens. You’ll find all sorts of delicious items to munch on, from freshly-baked pastries to fish dishes to decadent desserts. Though the lunch and dinner menus change daily, you can always expect to find the classic Viennese morning meal of handmade rolls, jam, and blossom honey on the breakfast menu. But, no matter what you order, the best part of your meal will likely be feasting your eyes on the greenery and glass fit for an emperor, or at least his plants.  If you're planning on visiting Palmenhaus for lunch or dinner, consider making a reservation via phone or online. (Note: They do not take reservations for the Burggarten.) If you're dining on a Friday evening, be sure to head over to the lounge for live DJ sets, where you can dance among the plants.",greenhouses butterflies restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars plants
11,Globe Museum,"Vienna, Austria",Handsomely crafted representations of our round planet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/globe-museum,"Until the 19th century, globes often came as a pair—a world globe and a matching celestial globe. One can’t help but observe the admirable craft and beauty that was once devoted to these small representations of our world. To visit the Globe Museum is to step back into a time when all things, including scientific instruments, were made with care and artistry. There is no better way to explore the ways in which man’s understanding of the earth and the heavens has changed over hundreds of years of exploration and study. The world’s only public museum dedicated solely to globes contains an astonishing collection. (The Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, also has an extensive globe collection.) There are folding fabric globes (which were inflated with a bellows), giant man-sized globes, and tiny plum-sized globes, each exquisitely made with dark wood, fine lines, and rich colors. Some of the most interesting items in the museum are the brass tellurions. A tellurion is a mechanical demonstration of the earth’s movement about its axes, consisting of a long arm at the end of which is a small rotating globe with a moon spinning around it. At the other end of the arm is a charmingly simple sun: a candle and a brass reflecting disc. With a turn of the crank, the system comes alive. As the earth and moon spin, the tellurion shows seasons, eclipses, tides, precessions of the equinox, and other astronomical phenomena.",globes marvelous maps and measures instruments of science inventions collections museums and collections
12,Sigmund Freud Museum,"Vienna, Austria",The former private quarters and office of Dr. Sigmund Freud now hosts a museum housing the works of the founding father of psychoanalysis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sigmund-freud-museum,"For 47 years, the controversial neurologist and pioneer of psychoanalysis lived and worked in the house at Berggasse 19. While his famous couch resides in the Freud Museum in London, along with many of the original furnishings from the Berggasse house, what remains is the precious legacy the good doctor left behind. Most of his writings were conjured here, and the rooms have been converted into archives of his life and works. Along with the lion’s share of Freud’s papers, the museum houses his impressive antique collection, and many of his personal items are located in what used to be his waiting room. Exhibitions display his influence on art and society, and attached to the museum are 35,000 volumes of psychoanalytic research, the largest library of its kind in Europe. Opened in 1971 by the Sigmund Freud Society with his youngest daughter Anna present, the museum now lies in the hands of the Sigmund Freud Foundation. The foundation hosts the Sigmund Freud Lecture every year on May 6th, the doctor’s birthday. While it is not the most colorful museum dedicated to the man, students and scholars will find it to be a suitable place to examine original documents and experience the few film and sound recordings made of Freud and his family.",medical libraries medical museums collections museums
13,Museum of Art Fakes,"Vienna, Austria",This Austrian museum celebrates the work of famous forgers and their inimitable imitations.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-art-fakes,"Sitting across from the famous work of architectural art, Hundertwasserhaus, one of the most original works in the world, is a small museum that takes a look at the other side of the art world where forgers, fakers, and charlatans thrive. The Museum of Art Fakes (Fälschermuseum) in Vienna is a little gallery that doesn’t have an original work in it. The collection contains works that appear to be from such art world luminaries as Klimt, Rembrandt, and Matisse, but were in fact created by the hand of some enterprising forger. Rather than condemning the practice, the museum celebrates the artistry of the forgery, being careful to distinguish different types of fakery. As their website describes it, there is forgery in the style of another painter, where a forger tries to create something they can pass off as a new work from a famous name; there is the identical forgery that is created to exactly replicate a pre-existing work; and there are copies, which are identical works created at least 70 years after the death of the original painter and sold as replicas. The collection also highlights a few notable forgers including Tom Keating who claims to have forged over 2,000 works as a statement against the corruption of the gallery scene, planting “time-bombs” in his replicas that could be discovered later, invalidating the forgeries to any duped collector. Of course, even these forgeries are now valuable. The museum also displays a number of forged diary pages purported to have been written by Adolf Hitler. Faking something well is no easy feat. Thanks to the Museum of Art Fakes, the appreciation of charlatan art is very real.",hoaxes hoaxes and pseudoscience museums and collections art museums
14,Hundertwasser's Odd Architecture,"Vienna, Austria",Op-art architecture designed for happiness.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/europe-s-oddest-architect,"Born Friedrich Stowasser in Vienna in 1928, this artist and architect took on the more grandiose name Friedensreich Regentag Dunkelbunt Hundertwasser during a stint at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Preferring spirals and curves to straight lines, he designed many eccentric structures with mismatched windows, some with trees growing out of them, undulating floors, bright tiles, and unexpected domes and curves. Three of his most famous structures can be seen in Vienna; the municipal heating plant Fernwarmewerk, the Hundertwasserhaus apartment building, and the KunstHaus, which is a museum of his works. Hundertwasser grew up in WWII-era Germany. Born to Catholic and Jewish parents, he joined the Hitler Youth to avoid persecution. His unusual architecture is an extension of his overall philosophy, outlined in the 1950s in assorted manifestos with names like “Mouldiness Manifesto against Rationalism in Architecture”, and “Speech in Nude for the Right to a Third Skin”, which must have been most interesting when presented live. He believed that happiness could be found in joyful design, and that the straight lines and boxes of traditional architecture were a problem to be solved. Hundertwasser’s eccentric structures delight visitors in Austria, Germany, Japan and and New Zealand. His final design was built after his death in Magdeburg, Germany in 2005. The artist lived in New Zealand in his later years, and died in 2000 aboard the RMS Queen Mary 2 en route to Germany where he was to view his last work, the “Waldspirale” in Darmstadt. In Vienna: Hundertwasserhaus (private residence) Hundertwasser’s most famous building was constructed between 1983 and 1986. The flowing lines and organic forms house 52 apartments and four offices, with plenty of room for living plants and trees.

And it is all owned by Swarovski. Swarovski’s surreal museum/theme park Crystal Worlds was first opened back in 1995 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the company’s founding. Like something out of a fairy tale, the park’s main attraction is the “Chambers of Wonder” exhibition, which is contained within a green hill, the entrance of which is made to look like a crouching giant. The exhibition itself consists of over a dozen different rooms decked out in Swarovski crystals, creating uniquely themed, glittering spaces that could just as easily be a dwarf king’s treasure hall. In 2015, the park was given a facelift and expanded to almost double the original size.

Visitors can ascend the winding stair that wraps itself around the tower and look out upon the ethereal and heavily wooded terrain just right outside the city. In 1889, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the reign of Emperor Franz Joseph I and to showcase the commercial and industrial innovation of the region, the tower began construction. The tower was first made of wood, however, and was destroyed by a storm shortly after its grand reveal. A year later, the tower reopened––this time made of steel––but by WWII, it began to decay and was demolished in 1953. A few years later, another attempt to reconstruct the tower began and it has remained ever since, with the last extensive renovation in the early 80s.

17,Wotruba Church,"Vienna, Austria",This cubist Vienna church building looks like some sort of alien stonehenge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wotruba-church,"Sitting atop a grassy hill in Vienna is the Kirche Zur Heiligsten Dreifaltigkeit (Church of the Most Holy Trinity), what looks to be an asymmetrical jumble of concrete slabs, precariously threaded together. However, most people simply know it as the Wotruba Church. On the initiative of Margarethe Ottillinger, a monastery church made of marble blocks was already planned by the Viennese architect Fritz Gerhard Mayr in the mid-1960s. Ottillinger, who was suspected of being an industrial spy and therefore spent a number of years in Russian captivity, was unable to realize her plan, and several years passed before construction could begin on the outskirts of the Wienerwald. The modernist chapel takes its name from the visionary architect behind its creation, Fritz Wotruba. The sculptor-cum-architect began building the strange building in 1974, inspired by elaborately gothic Chartres Cathedral, though you could be forgiven from seeing how given the brutalist church that he ended up designing. Built on the site of a former Nazi barracks, the church is formed from 152 concrete blocks, bolted together like a Jenga tower in mid-tumble. The windows are built into the irregular spaces between the blocks. Inside of the church, the main chapel is essentially mundane with regular church seats, uniform psalm books tucked into their backs. Were it not for the chaos of the church walls all around, it would not seem that different from any other around the world. Unfortunately, Wotruba did not live to see his beautifully odd church reach completion. He died in 1975, just a year shy of the building’s completion in 1976. While the architect behind the alien church did not survive to appreciate his work, it still stands today, wowing parishioners and fans of odd architecture alike. Even today, the untreated concrete surfaces are in astonishingly good condition and are hardly weathered or riddled with cracks. It may seem a bit cold and abstract in comparison to more traditional churches, but the experience of walking into a giant brutalist sculpture is heavenly in its own right.",brutalism churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
18,Schloss Hellbrunn,"Salzburg, Austria",Trick water gardens from 1619 featuring a 200 piece mechanical theater powered by water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/schloss-hellbrunn,"Schloss Hellbrunn was the summer playhouse of Markus Sittikus, the archbishop of Salzburg, built-in 1619. The palace was only for the daytime; there are no bedrooms in the home. It was simply an opulent and delightful place to while away the hot summer days for the powerful archbishop and his friends. But Hellbrunn was not merely a place for luxurious food, wine, and music. The palace was built over natural springs (supplied by the palace’s namesake, Hellbrunn River), which inspired Markus Sittikus to outfit Hellbrunn’s vast gardens with some remarkable fountains. A summer day at Hellbrunn would start with a great outdoor feast. As the guests finished off their meal, water would suddenly shoot out of the table, and out of each guest’s seat, completely soaking all present, except, of course, the archbishop. Sittikus would then lead his sopping and delighted guests through the gardens, showing them many marvels of the day. Small water-powered automata dot the grounds, depicting everything from a knife-sharpener grinding scissors to the mythological Perseus, fighting the sea dragon, and freeing the captured Andromeda. There are several beautiful grottoes, each one featuring a different curiosity, like the Birdcall Grotto—a mechanism, hidden from sight, makes the sounds of different bird calls, tweeting and singing in a cacophony of song. The water-powered device consisted of bellows and a pin roller which directed the air into the different pipes for the birdcalls. Also, a delight of its day was the crown grotto, in which a golden crown would rise and fall on a jet of water, illustrating the quick and easy rise and fall of power. As his guests gazed on these wonders, Markus Sittikus would place himself discreetly next to a set of controls…and before the guests knew what was happening, they were being soaked from all directions. No one was safe. It was impossible to guess when the water would come, and where it would come from. No spot in the garden was dry, except wherever Markus Sittikus stood, and where the tour guide stands today. Hellbrunn remains almost completely unchanged nearly 400 years later, except for the Mechanical Theater, which was added in 1750, a little more than 100 years after Markus Sittikus’ death. The complicated mechanism for the enormous automaton is still functioning in its original form. The incredible theater displays a bustling baroque town with 200 moving figures, repeating their clockwork motions to the water-powered organ music. The huge and complex Mechanical Theater and trick fountains of Hellbrunn would have been a marvel to guests in its day - and remains just as marvelous today. Other attractions on the palace grounds include a museum in Hellbrunn hall, the Salzburg zoo, and the Steintheater, a rock quarry that was repurposed as an outdoor stone theater. Also on display is the pavilion used in the 1964 musical “The Sound of Music.” Perhaps the best attraction is the Monatsschlösschen, which houses the folklore section of Salzburg’s Carolino Augusteum Museum.

19,Cemetery of the Nameless,"Vienna, Austria",The resting place for anonymous victims of the Danube's dark waters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cemetery-of-the-nameless,"Suicide victims turned away from a Catholic burial, bodies with no names fished out of the Danube. That’s who lies resting in this hard-to-find cemetery. The cemetery was originally opened in 1840 and subsequently, following repeated floodings and the construction of a dyke, expanded in 1900. In 1935, a small, modernist graveyard chapel (built by architect Karl Franz Eder) encompassed by rosebushes was built on top of a hill between the two parts of the cemetery. While the older part lies abandoned these days behind the embankment, overgrown by bushes and trees, the new section is surrounded by a small wall and has been taken care of by the family of Josef Fuchs since 1933. Up until 1900, 478 unidentified people were buried at the cemetery, many of whom drowned in the Danube or committed suicide, thus denied a Christian burial by the Catholic church in Vienna’s Central Cemetery, Zentralfriedhof. The new part of the cemetery is the last resting place for another 104 dead, 61 of whom remained unidentified and most of whom the river’s current brought ashore nearby due to the junction of river and canal. The last nameless body was buried here in 1940. As the municipality of Albern was incorporated into Vienna in 1938, all unknown dead since have been buried in the Central Cemetery. In addition, due to the 1939 construction and expansion of the Alberner Hafen, an industrial harbor, the currents in the Danube have changed; its waters no longer swirling debris of any kind ashore, its victims no longer given up so easily. Most of the graves are adorned by black crosses made of cast iron, each featuring a silvery crucifix. Following tradition, each year on All Saints’ Day local fishermen honor the unknown dead in a small ceremony by floating a raft on the Danube, remembering the dead by a commemorative inscription in German, Hungarian and Slovak. Located in Simmering at the Alberner Hafen, at the junction of Danube and the Donaukanal (Danube Canal), the cemetery is quite difficult to find, an unexpected gem hidden behind an industrial estate and two staggeringly huge grain elevators. Take bus 76A to the stop 'Alberner Hafen', follow the street ('Molostraße') roughly 500 meters through the industrial estate, passing by the grain elevators and warehouses on your left. At the end of the street, on the banks of the Danube, you find the cemetery.",memento mori catacombs and crypts cemeteries
20,Wiener Pestsäule (Vienna Plague Column),"Vienna, Austria",Baroque celebration of the end of the Great Plague of Vienna.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vienna-pestsaule-plague-column,"Placed in the middle of one of Vienna’s most famous streets the huge gilded, baroque confection of a sculpture at its center is in fact a memorial to the worst plague in Viennese history. The Great Plague of Vienna brought the imperial city to its knees. Death toll estimates range wildly from a merely upsetting 12,000 to a truly devestating 75,000 people. The killer is thought to be the same Bubonic Plague (Yersinia pestis) that raged first in the 14th century, and began a second tour of duty in the 17th. All across Europe, outbreaks of disease crippled towns, but Vienna, as a trade cross-road was perfectly placed for a true epidemic. The Viennese Plague is notable for some of the first modern approaches to controlling the outbreak. While still wildly feared and treated largely with a mixture of religious speculation and leeches, city doctor Paul de Sorbait made the first inroads on sanitation measures to control the spread of disease, and the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity created special plague hospitals to care for the infected, and deal with the bodies of the dead - most of which were burned outside of city limits in giant plague pits. Not great, but an improvement on the “just leave them there and don’t touch them” approach. Freely mixing religious iconography with the Hapsburg dynastic motifs, the 69 foot tall tower is as much political propaganda as it is a sacred memorial. This elaborate column was erected in 1693 in the place of a simpler column erected during the plague by the Brotherhood. The figures at the base represent the triumph of faith over disease, while the mid-portion of the sculpture is dedicated to coats of arms and a praying figure of Emperor Leopold I - who, it should be noted, must have been doing that praying from a distance, as he fled the city during the outbreak. It is topped by golden cherubs and other religious figures, and, at last check, a rather unsightly mass of bird netting.",hapsburgs plague festivals memento mori statues
21,Naturhistorisches Museum,"Vienna, Austria",Beautiful Austrian natural history museum with carved ceilings and row after row of ancient taxidermy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/naturhistorisches-museum,"The rooms of the Naturhistorisches, or Natural History Museum, in Vienna, Austria are astonishingly beautiful, with carved ceilings and creaking wood floors. Each room, painted a different color, is lined with dark wood cases filled with row after row of taxidermy. In some rooms, the walls are covered with the delicate, twisting vertebrae of snakes, others feature the sturdy bone shells of turtles. The display cabinets seem to come straight from an 18th-century naturalist’s study, with lines of mice carefully tagged and cataloged.  Indeed, many eminent naturalists served as collectors and advisors to the museum including the famous Alexander Von Humboldt and the museum is undeniably from another time in its ambiance. Yet the curators do manage to keep the collection updated and fresh with objects like the stereoscopic slide viewers sprinkled throughout the museum. The modernity of these 3-D photographs provides an interesting contrast with the rest of the collection. Of particular note are the glass models of sea-life around the museum, the work of the Blaschkas, a 19th-century father and son team of expert glassmakers. The jellyfish are simply breathtaking.",blaschka models wonder cabinets natural history museums and collections
22,Vienna Sewer System,"Vienna, Austria",Vienna's underworld of tunnels and subterranean rivers made an iconic appearance in a 1949 Orson Welles film.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vienna-sewer-system,"Beneath the streets of Vienna lies another network of passages: its historic sewer system that dates back to the mid-1800s. It’s one of the most impressive sewer systems in Europe, but this underworld of Vienna is famous for a very different reason: its iconic appearance in the 1949 film The Third Man. Set in the divided, war-torn Vienna of 1947, the film, starring Orson Welles, portrays the issues prevalent in post-war Vienna, including the division of the city into sectors, the black market, and penicillin theft. It eventually culminates in a tense, eerie scene featuring Welles running through the sewers, brilliantly atmospheric in black-and-white and with dramatic camera angles. It made the tunnels famous—to whatever extent a sewer can become a celebrity.  This system of tunnels and underground rivers was the most complex in Europe at the time it was built, and was widely expanded after a debilitating cholera outbreak in 1830. Storm waters and sewage were channeled into a system for the first time and kept out of the Danube and its tributaries. The sewer was further expanded throughout the 19th and 20th centuries to keep up with the city’s population growth, and despite suffering heavy bombing (along with the rest of the city) during World War II, repairs were completed by 1950. Parts of the sewers are open to the public, but only via an occasional guided tour. It uses the film as a theme, but the sewers are a spectacular sight in their own right, a brilliant part of city infrastructure and a historic piece of engineering well worth seeing.  Reservation online or via phone is required (the phone number is available on the website). Whilst a trip into the sewers, it is never too dark (they are well lit, and additionally headlamps are worn) and it does not venture into any small spaces. There are some narrow passages, but they are tall and many spaces in the tour are large, even cavernous. The tours are given with fully trained sewer workers. Tours are only available in English at 3pm daily. Look for the '3. Mann Tour' booth at Karlsplatz-Girardipark, 1010 Wien, opposite the Café Museum. Tours are currently suspended due to Covid-19.",sewers subterranean underground film locations film infrastructure subterranean sites world war ii water military
23,Museum of Contraception and Abortion,"Vienna, Austria",This museum promotes informed contraception by documenting its often secret past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-contraception-and-abortion,"Despite the daunting challenge of collecting information and artifacts surrounding one of the most unspoken parts of our culture, Vienna’s Museum of Contraception and Abortion has managed to gather an impressive collection of contraceptive curios that tell the often tragic tale of pregnancy avoidance and termination. Founded in 2003 by gynecologist and abortion provider Dr. Christian Fiala, the museum has met with praise and controversy in equal measure. The collection is located in Vienna, Austria, a country with one of the most intolerant attitudes towards contraception and consequently one of the highest abortion rates in Europe. Undaunted by the critics, Fiala opened the museum with the express goal of educating visitors about the necessity and reality of pregnancy avoidance through the artifacts and history of the precaution. The museum is split into two wings, one devoted to contraception and the other devoted to abortion. As visitors enter the museum, they must first pass through the contraceptive wing. This section collects a number of historical forms of birth control ranging from the harmful to the seemingly insane. There are soaps, sponges, plugs, and washes that were said to prevent insemination, many of which released harmful (if not fatal) agents into the users body, alongside condoms made from everything from pig bladders to sheep skin. Each piece has information placing the item into a historical or cultural context which gives the exhibit a gravity well above gawking at the insanity of the past. Once through the contraceptive portion of the museum, guests enter the abortion portion. This half of the museum explores the varied ways that women have tried or been instructed to do in order to terminate unwanted pregnancies. The often gruesome remainders of abortion’s history include pins, hangers, and other tragic instruments used to induce a miscarriage. While sometimes uncomfortable, the displays are invaluable in understanding the need for the safe abortion treatments we have today.",medical museums women museums and collections museums
24,Wolf and Cow Playing Backgammon Mural,"Vienna, Austria",A silly medieval mural preserved on the side of a Viennese house.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wolf-and-cow-playing-backgammon,"In the 15th century, Enea Silvio Bartolomeo Piccolomini, better known later in life as Pope Pius II, described all the fine houses of Vienna as being painted inside and out with fabulous scenery. Like the marginalia found in illuminated manuscripts, the houses would have featured religious and historic portraiture, along with some humorous imagery for good measure. These medieval murals have mostly been destroyed by time, but one, of the humorous variety, can be seen today on a house in Vienna’s historic center. The facade of the Hasenaus (“Hare House”) features a wolf and a cow in spectacles engaged in a game of backgammon. Behind the board are the legs of a man, who appears to be holding a fly swatter, perhaps to attend to the players. One explanation for this absurd scene is that it is an allegory for the political tensions between Protestants and Catholics. It’s not clear who’s winning. Others have suggested that the man behind the game is a furrier eagerly awaiting the conclusion of the game so he can take the hide of the loser. The wall painting dates approximately to 1509. The house would have been originally been covered with scenes of medieval life, in particular one large motif of a rabbit hunt (hence the name). But when it was refurbished in the 18th century, all but the backgammon game was lost. Luckily, it has been carefully preserved so that Viennese and visitors alike can admire it, wondering what it’s supposed to mean.",wolves cows games murals medieval animals art

At the Austrian brewer Starkenberger’s Castle they offer a complete beer-centered experience with beer trivia, beer history, and of course, beer drinking. However, the most unique elements of the castle are the “world’s only beer-swimming-pools” — seven 13-foot pools of warm beer (with some water), each containing some 42,000 pints where one can sit and bathe and relax fully immersed in beer. The beer is rich in vitamins and calcium, and it is said that sitting in it is good for the skin and helps cure open wounds and psoriasis. The pools started back in 2005 when the old fermentation cellar of the 700-year-old castle became obsolete, so they turned the area into a beer spa. The beer is kept quite hot, although you can order a cold beer from the pool. Drinking from the pool is ill-advised.

26,"""Stock-im-Eisen"" Nail Tree","Vienna, Austria",Legends surround an ancient tree trunk riddled with nails for good luck.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stock-im-eisen-nail-tree,"Once thought to have been the last tree standing in an ancient forest, or the work of Satan himself, hundreds of nails have been driven into the wood of this ancient tree trunk for reasons unknown. “Stock-im-Eisen” means “staff in iron” in German, and is the oldest known example of the tradition. These types of Nagelbaum or “nail trees” were common throughout southeastern Europe in the middle ages. The reasons behind them are not totally clear. It is thought that the practice of sacrificing what would have at the time a fairly valuable item, nails, was done as an act of thanks or in hopes of good luck. The nails trees of Europe inspired a similar practice during WWI of creating patriotic “Nail Men” as fundraising projects and acts of national pride. Research in the 1970s dated the spruce tree approx 1400, with the first nails driven in while it was still alive. It was cut down around 40 years later. The section now on display is about 7 feet tall,  and is accompanied by decorative panels illustrating the history of the nagelbaum. On display since at least 1548, the tree is now located safely behind glass on a corner of the magnificent Palais Equitable at the corner of the Graben and Karntner Strasse in Vienna.",flora trees plants
27,Ungarisches Haus (Hungarian House),"Vienna, Austria","The townhouse where the ""Blood Countess"" Elizabeth Báthory started her murderous career.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ungarisches-haus-hungarian-house,"The plain facade of this townhouse betrays nothing of the atrocities that may have taken place here when it was the residence of one Countess Elizabeth Báthory. Elizabeth Báthory is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the most prolific female murderer ever, but she might even be the most prolific murderer of all the Western World. She allegedly tortured and killed more than 600 virgin women in order to drink and bathe in their blood, believing it would preserve her youth and beauty. Some historians believe that these accusations were trumped up as an intrigue to bring down a powerful woman, but the number of testimonies against her as well as Báthory’s own confessions make for a convincing case. At the turn of the 17th century, the “Blood Countess” intermittently lived in her husband’s Hungarian House at 12 Augustinerstrasse, right in the heart of Vienna. The rest of her time was spent at Cachtice Castle, where she eventually moved full-time as she drew more and more suspicion. The city’s nearby markets served as a hunting ground for Bathory’s servant Ficzkó, who was instrumental in providing a steady stream of young Viennese maids for the countess. With the promise of food, shelter, comfort, and security, the young women would leave their families to serve the mysterious noblewomen. Ficzkó and other servants would return year after year, luring in more and more young ladies (all of them beautiful), but those who left would never be seen again. Some were taken to Cachtice Castle, though in the beginning some were employed at the Hungarian House. Though no townsperson dared to question the countess, there were frequently strange sounds emanating from the house at nighttime. Apparently the nocturnal disturbances once even prompted the monks from the Augustinian monastery across the street to pelt the house with earthenware, demanding silence. It apparently began as simple domestic abuse, flogging them and leaving them naked in the snow—atrocious, to be sure, but not uncommon in these pre-OSHA days. But the abuse the young women suffered at the hands of the countess and her accomplices grew more and more diabolic. Reports included everything from pulling their fingers off to biting the flesh from their faces, and then, of course, draining their blood so that she could bathe in it. All of this was eventually discovered at her castle, where she was put on an early form of house arrest—simply walled in and never allowed to venture out. You can visit the ruins, but for some Elizabeth Báthory deep cuts, pay a visit to her townhouse in Vienna, the place it all began. The house is not open to the public, but you can always visit the Italian restaurant on the corner.

An unsettling depiction of an emaciated death holding an hourglass evokes the sense of memento mori: Remember that you too will die. It isn’t hard to forget in this cemetery, where skulls abound - including winged skulls, skulls with snakes emerging from their eye sockets, skulls on which angels prop themselves, skulls with hourglasses, skulls with a pick and axe for miner’s graves, and skulls that hold holy water. The cemetery was built in 1502 and holds the remains of some big Austrian names. Mozart’s wife and father rest there, as well as Archbishop Wolf Dietrich, who helped make Salzburg rich with his salt mines, and who was later arrested and imprisoned over salt-mine rights. Dietrich was denied the archbishop’s honor of being buried in the Salzburg Cathedral crypt, and instead his remains are housed in a massive mausoleum, the centerpiece of the St. Sebastian Cemetery. Just to the right of the cemetery’s entrance, up a small flight of stairs, is the grave of and a monument to physician, botanist, alchemist, astrologer, occultist, and philosopher Theophrastus Paracelsus (1493-1541), “the father of modern medicine.”",memento mori catacombs and crypts cemeteries
29,Gasometer Town,"Vienna, Austria",Apartment complexes built into huge repurposed natural gas tanks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gasometer-town,"A gasometer or a gas holder is a large container in which natural gas is stored at atmospheric pressure. In the 19th and early-20th century, gasometers were used to temporarily store natural gas near towns and city districts, where it could be used by industry and households. The purpose of these installations was to lower the gas pressure from high levels present in pipelines. They also regulated the supply between periods of high and low demand during the day. An average gasometer is a gigantic structure, capable of storing tens of thousands of cubic meters of gas, with diameters that could reach up to 60m. Due to technological advances, gasometers have been largely replaced by other methods of gas storage, such as giant underground facilities and high pressure pipes. By the end of the century, many towns and cities in the U.S. and Europe ended up with disused gasometers scattered around their suburbs. While some of these giant objects have been demolished to make way for new urban development projects, some of them have been reclaimed and converted for new purposes. An excellent example are the former Gaswerk Simmering gasometers in Vienna. This complex of four gasometers was built in a period of three years, between 1896 and 1899, in order to supply town gas for Vienna’s street lamps. Each of these gargantuan tanks could hold up to 90,000 cubic meters of gas. They remained in use for almost a century, until 1984. After they were finally retired from gas storage, these ornate red brick structures were deemed too beautiful to be destroyed. Instead they were converted into apartment blocks and commercial space. Only brick facades and metallic roofs remain of the original construction. The new interior of each gasometer was designed by a different architect, Jean Nouvel (Gasometer A), Coop Himmelblau (Gasometer B), Manfred Wehdorn (Gasometer C), and Wilhelm Holzbauer (Gasometer D). The reconstruction started in 1995 and finished in 2001. The lower floors of the gasometers are occupied by shopping malls, mid levels are converted into office spaces, and apartments are situated on the top of the structures. In the years between decommissioning and reconstruction, the four gasometers had a brief stint in the film industry, as a setting of one of the James Bond films and as a venue for raves. These large round structures provided an unusual echo effect popular with ravers of the day.",architectural oddities architecture
30,Vienna Grand Ferris Wheel,"Vienna, Austria",Vienna's giant wonder wheel had a starring role in one of the greatest noir movies of all time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vienna-grand-ferris-wheel,"Vienna’s grand ferris wheel, the Wiener Riesenrad, was, until 1985, the largest in the world. Found in Prater Park, just north of the elegance of Vienna’s Inner City, the giant ferris wheel will be, for lovers of cinema, forever linked to the classic film, The Third Man. Carol Reed’s 1949 film noir masterpiece starring Joseph Cotton as Holly Martins, concerns a writer searching amidst the ruins of post war Vienna for his enigmatic friend, Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles. Filmed almost entirely on location amongst the actual rubble of Vienna in the late 1940s, one of the most famous scenes was shot on the iconic ferris wheel. Discovering that his friend Harry Lime had not only faked his own death, but was mixed up in a black market racket selling doctored penicillin which caused the deaths of many children, the Riesenrad was where Lime, looking down 212 feet to the people below, asks Martins, “Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever… if I said you can have twenty thousand pounds for every dot that stops.” The Prater Park itself dates much further back, to when Emperor Joseph II, at the height of the power of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, gave his hunting ground over to the public to become an amusement park in 1766. Called the Wurstelprater, the amusement park is one of the oldest in Europe. The Riesenrad itself was built in 1897 by an engineer of the British Royal Navy, Lieutenant Walter Bassett Bassett. The grand ferris wheel is largely unchanged from its condition during the filming of The Third Man. The distinctive red numbered gondolas provide the same exceptional views over one of Europe’s most beautiful cities. Some of the old gondolas can be reserved for romantic dinners, and at the height of the ferris wheel’s slow turning to the top, the people down below do indeed resemble dots.

31,Josephinum Medical Museum,"Vienna, Austria",One of the best collections of wax anatomical models in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/josephinum-medical-museum,"Once an academy for aspiring imperial army surgeons, the Josephinum is now a medical museum housing the second largest collection of wax anatomical models in the world, and the largest collection of wax obstetric models. Protected in their original rosewood and venetian glass displays from the late 1700s, the 1,192 models of dismembered body parts and whole figures were created to train medical students in an age when corpse dissection was still messy, inconvenient and, in some places, illegal. The details are exquisitely accurate, down to the wax-dipped thread serving as veins and arteries. In order to get these 1,192 fragile objects from the wax-artists workshop in Florence to Vienna, Austria in the 18th century, the models were painstakingly carried over the alps by pack mule, and then traveled by Danube river the rest of the way to their new home. Arguably the most beautiful model is the “Anatomical Venus”. The wax woman, inspired by the goddess of beauty, lies supine in a glass coffin with her chest splayed open to reveal her inner workings. With long hair, eyelashes, pearls and a gold headband, this gutted Snow White is an exquisite example of the 18th century marriage of art and science. The museum also has a large collection of early medical instruments. Clemente Susini’s wax models, painstaking to produce and incredibly fragile, can be seen in only a few other locations throughout the world, including La Specola Museum in Florence, the Semmelweis Museum in Budapest, and the Wax Anatomy Museum ot University of Cagliari.  Currently, the Josephinum is closed due to extensive renovation work. According to the website, it will remain closed for the next few years.

32,Brest Hero-Fortress,"Brest, Belarus",Thanks to its heroic service during WWII this Soviet castle has been turned into a monument towered over by a brutalist titan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brest-hero-fortress,"Much like the Soviet “Hero Cities” that were given a special title due to their special defense of the nation during World War II, the Brest Fortress (now “Hero-Fortress”) acted as a critical bulwark during the German invasion and now the site is protected as a major war memorial distinguished by its brutalist concrete statues and architecture. First established in 1830 the fortress was designed as an impenetrable star sitting at the confluence of two rivers. There was a central structure known as the “Citadel” which was protected on all sides by three wide fortifications. As the westernmost defensive position in the Soviet empire in the 19th and early 20th century, Brest Fortress was a proud symbol of national strength almost from its inception, but it was also an important target for European invaders. After changing hands a few times during and after World War I, the Brest Fortress earned its lasting legacy during the World War II German invasion, Operation Barbarossa. During the siege, tens of thousands of German troops hammered the fortress which held strong thanks to a garrison of civilians and military who were nearly able to turn back the assault. Eventually the fortress fell however, with much of it being destroyed or damaged during the siege. At the end of the war Brest was liberated and the fortress was retaken from the Germans, still the worse for wear. Instead of demolishing the complex, the entire site was turned into a huge memorial to the fighting men and women who died defending the position. It was given the new title of “Hero Fortress” and eventually large pieces of statuary were installed. Today much of the defense is preserved just as it was after the war with the crumbling walls and bullet holes intact. Among the stunning and powerful sights are the massive star-shaped gate, a memorial known as “Thirst” that shows a sickly soldier getting a drink of river water, and the main monument which takes the form of an imperious stone giant. The main museum also holds a wealth of displays telling the story of the fortress. The main entrance is in the end of praspekt Mašerava. You can enter or leave the complex from other gates as well.

33,Minsk KFC,"Minsk, Belarus",Remnants of the city's Soviet history hover over this modern fast-food outlet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/minsk-kfc,"It’s difficult to miss the irony when you spot the smiling face of Colonel Sanders beckoning you in for fried chicken beneath a dramatic Soviet mural. At one of Minsk’s ever-expanding KFC franchises, communism and capitalism collide in a confusing contrast of heroic sculptures and crispy fried chicken. This is the most dramatic of Minsk’s KFC outlets, just one of many fast-food chains that crept into the Belarusian market as the country began to emerge from isolation in the last few years. KFC first set up business in Belarus in 2015, while the Soviet sculpture that sits above the fried chicken shop was carved in the 1960s. The sculpture, designed in the style of Socialist Realism that was popular across the Soviet Union at the time, is named “Solidarity” and was created by the sculptor Anatol Yafimovich Arcimovich. The KFC was designed in the style of countless other KFCs that you’ll find across the world, from the United States to China, with the distinctive red colors of the Colonel’s enduring brand filling in for the red of socialism. Perhaps this is how the Cold War was always meant to end, as the workers of the world unite to dine on bargain buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The reality is less idealistic, but this Soviet-style KFC in Minsk is still definitely a measure of change in the Belarusian capital. Minsk suffered immeasurable damage during the fierce fighting of World War II, but once the German army had been beaten back, Minsk was honored as a Hero City and was rebuilt and restyled into a Soviet model city, on the express orders of Joseph Stalin. The wide boulevards and elaborate murals and sculptures are a lasting relic of the Socialist era, while the fast-food chains and Western brands mark the turning point toward capitalism. Whether you’re a fan of the Colonel’s fried chicken or not, there’s no doubt that this is one of the most striking KFCs in the world. In fact, it’s probably the most Soviet KFC in the world.  This KFC is found on the corner of Prospekte Pobeditelei, opposite Niamiha Metro Station and just down the road from the Palace of Sports.",beautiful fast food communist architecture soviet architecture chickens fried foods fast food communism soviet history sculptures

Lined up against the walls are rows of glass containers holding preserved fetuses and babies with serious deformities: Siamese twins who remained connected after birth, “mermaids” with their legs fused together, fetuses with only one eye, babies with two faces. These malformed fetuses were collected during the 19th and 20th century, and initially remained in storage until 2000 when an exhibit was created and opened to the public for a brief period. It reopened in its current format in 2012 and is a fascinating spot for those interested in teratology, or the study of abnormal formations and anatomical abnormalities. One of the missions of the museum is to emphasize the importance of healthy lifestyles. To this end, the museum is divided into two halls. One of the halls contains exhibits relating to common lifestyle problems like smoking, alcoholism, and obesity. The other hall houses the collection of babies with abnormalities that researchers believe were a result of the parent’s lifestyle choices. A similar collection would be hard to gather today thanks to modern medical advances that have made it easy to diagnose such problems in the early stages of a pregnancy. The building itself has early medical connections. It was built by King Stefan Bathory, of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, who died in the palace under mysterious circumstances in 1586. His doctors performed an autopsy on his body to get some answers, and this was the first anatomical autopsy in eastern Europe.  The museum is open from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday. The admission fee is 1 ruble ($0.53) and goes directly to the funding of the Medical University.

When the owners of these confiscated artifacts cannot be found, rather than hiding them away or destroying them, the items are put on display in the city’s small but wildly diverse Museum of Rescued Art Treasures. The collection contains over 300 pieces that have been collected, mainly during the 1990s when smugglers were trying to take advantage of the political upheaval in Russia. Items on display range from ancient artifacts from the 16th century to contemporary works of art. Historic bibles, religious triptychs, Soviet sculptures, paintings, and all manner of other works are on exhibit within the confines of the home-sized museum. The largest find on display is an entire set of antique furniture that was found hidden in a shipment of milk powder. Unfortunately, not all of the “saved” pieces came out of their ordeals unscathed. In order to transport some of the larger items they had to be chopped up into component parts, and have been reassembled as well as possible in the museum, although they will clearly never be the same. Nonetheless, it is a far nobler fate than being sold on the black market and forever lost to the world.",crime museums crime crime and punishment museums and collections art museums

Why not drink a cup of cat coffee or cat tea while playing cat chess or cat checkers, admiring cat art? Or, if you prefer, pet one of the cats that comprise the museum’s “staff.” The Cat Museum opened to the public in 2015. Jimmy the cat, the furry, four-legged “director” of the museum, welcomed everyone to the first exhibition. Titled Cats in the City, it showed photos, paintings, and other pieces of arts made by both Belarusian and foreign artists. Ever since, there have been cat-related exhibitions on display in the museum and visitors are also welcome to leave their own pieces of arts using the pens and papers provided. The staff of the museum consists of cats that were previously strays. After veterinary inspection and vaccination, they become full-time employees at the Cat Museum. Of course, the director also has a few human employees to help out. And, unlike most museums, a visitor who finds a staff member they like in particular is welcome to bring him or her home if they promise to take good care of them. The Cat Museum is only a short walk from the metro station Oktyabrskaya (Kastryčnickaja).

With 8 triangular faces and 18 square faces, the bizarre geometric shape was chosen for the new design of the library and has been turning heads since its construction. Designed by architects Mihail Vinogradov and Viktor Kramarenko, the library’s main section is 236 feet high and features 22 levels of collections along with large conference rooms that can seat 500 people. In total, the library has 8,600,000 items available in a variety of languages and types of media. Although its size and shape are unique, when the building is illuminated it steps into a class of its own. Dominating the landscape for miles around, the glowing orb has almost become more of a tourist attraction than a functional library. This is probably aided by the newly designed park which houses the library, along with the library’s observation deck that looks over Minsk.",libraries architectural oddities architecture
38,Kafe Gagarin,"Brest, Belarus",Take Soviet nostalgia to new heights by toasting the first man in space over a full spread of Belarusian and Soviet fare.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kafe-gagarin,"On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first astronaut to orbit the Earth. Named a Hero of the Soviet Union, he remains one of the most famous cosmonauts in the history of space travel. Decades later, long after the fall of the Soviet Union and Gagarin’s own death in a training-jet crash, his legacy as the first man in space is still revered, especially at Kafe Gagarin, a Soviet-themed restaurant in Brest, Belarus, that celebrates all things Gagarin while serving Kremlin-worthy dishes that might even have satisfied Stalin. It’s a unique, yet endearingly bizarre place to dine. The outside seating—a series of booths set inside a stretched, 1960s-style sedan and decorated with a backdrop of a Soviet beach holiday—doesn’t exactly fit chilly, inland Belarus. Inside, you’re greeted by a beaming Yuri Gagarin, depicted in a mural in full cosmonaut gear. Newspaper cuttings from April 12, 1961, adorn the front walls and serve as placemats, while the television’s endless loop of black and white newsreels take you back to the lofty heights of the Soviet space program. Communist flags hang from the ceiling, and Soviet stars decorate the napkins and menus. But Kafe Gagarin is more than just a nostalgic shrine to Yuri Gagarin, and compared to the cosmonauts’ early space food, the Belarusian and Soviet classics on the menu are out of this world. While Gagarin is blasted into space, you can slurp an appetizer of vibrantly pink borscht soup. When Gagarin lands back on earth, you’ll be tucking into plates of vareniki dumplings and stacks of draniki, the Belarusian potato pancake staple. And thanks to a plentiful selection of beers, wines, and vodkas, you can wash down pork cutlets or chicken kievs as you’re transported to a bygone era.",the soviet imprint space soviet history restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars
39,Mound of Glory,"Smaliavicki rajon, Belarus",A striking Soviet memorial commemorates the liberation of Belarus from the Nazis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mound-of-glory,"Anyone heading toward or out of Minsk on the Minsk-Moscow highway can hardly miss the dramatic bayonet-shaped obelisks towering over the road, a little outside the city. The unusual-looking Mound of Glory memorial honors the soldiers that fought and died in the Second World War, and is a tribute to an important victory in Soviet history, Operation Bagration, which liberated the region from the Nazis in 1944. The memorial complex was built in 1969 to mark the 25th anniversary of Belarus’ liberation from the German forces. The operation was carried out by four fronts of the Soviet Army, and their heroism is celebrated through the four tall bayonets, surrounded by a huge ring. The inside of the ring is decorated by mosaic tributes. The more striking outer side depicts the faces of soldiers and military symbols. The 230-feet mound it’s built on has its own significance—it was formed using scorched soil from “hero cities,” a Soviet honorary title for places that showed great courage during the period of German occupation. Visitors can walk up to the top of the structure to take a closer look at the ring and the bayonets. The memorial is a solemn structure, a reminder of a war where thousands of lives were lost, but its height and scenic overlook have made it a popular spot for newlyweds to snap pictures.",soviet architecture war memorial soviet history military history war history world war ii military
40,The Stalin Line,"Minski rajon, Belarus","Remains of the old fortification along the Western border of the USSR, now an elaborate defense museum.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-stalin-line-minski-rajon-belarus,"Not far from the capital city of Belarus is one of the most grandiose defense museums in Eastern Europe, the Stalin Line Historical and Cultural Complex, named after the original Stalin Line, a network of fortifications along the Western border of the former Soviet Union. The fortified line was built in the 1920s to protect against attacks from the West. But when an attack from the West did come two decades later, the line provided little defense. The Stalin Line was an impressive line of concrete bunkers and weapons emplacements, aka pillboxes, that stretched from the Karelian Isthmus near Finland to the shores of the Black Sea. However, it was abandoned by 1940 in favor of a newer line being built further West at the frontier of the expanding USSR. When Germany invaded in 1941, the new line was not yet finished, and the old line was in disrepair, leaving the Soviet Union vulnerable. Today, what remains of this historical system can be found in various places across Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. To commemorate the 60 year anniversary of Great Patriotic War (World War II), a collection of military paraphernalia was amassed in the area of the line near Minsk. The museum complex includes a collection of trenches, roadblocks, bunkers, dots and other fortifications, and all kinds of technology like radar systems, boats, helicopters, war planes, tanks and weapons. Visitors who are keen on racing around in a war machine can even try out some of this equipment. But one exhibit stands as a reminder of the horrors of warfare: Called “Bombed House,” it is a replica of what an ordinary house would look like after being bombed in war.",forts military history war history world war ii military museums and collections museums
41,Geographic Center of Europe,"Polotsk, Belarus",A monument in the Belarusian city of Polotsk claims to mark the exact midpoint of the European continent.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/geographic-center-of-europe,"The small city of Polotsk in the Vitebsk region of northern Belarus is the exact geographic center of the European continent. Or so it claims. Admittedly, the geographic center of Europe is more widely recognized as being slightly further to the east outside Vilnius, Lithuania, based on research led by Jean-George Affholder of the National Geographic Institute of France. However, more recent research conducted by a Belarusian team (who presumably had no bias whatsoever) identified the center of Europe as being in their own country. Belarusian geodesists Alexey Solomonov and Valery Anoshko published their discovery in 2000 in a Moscow-based technical magazine. This most recent in a long line of claimants to the “center of Europe” title was verified by Russian scientists from the Central Research Institute of Geodesy, Aerial Survey and Cartography in Moscow. The prized location in Polotsk is memorialized by a monument established in 2008. Though small in comparison to some of the larger Soviet-era monuments nearby—including a lovely Lenin statue up the street—the center of Europe marker is a very nicely designed element of the tree-lined city center, even if the claim is taken with a pinch of salt by locals. The monument depicts the northern hemisphere of the Earth with a map of Europe crossed by meridians. The boat on top of the marker is a symbol of the city of Polotsk, which was an important trading post on the River Dvina dating back to the time of the Vikings. In addition to visiting the monument, if you head to the nearby post office, you can purchase a certificate to prove you’ve been to the very heart of the continent.  The marker is in a public park in the center of town, surrounded by many shops, restaurants, and museums to explore. Inscriptions on the monument are written in Swedish, Russian, Greek, English, and Belarusian.",geography geographic markers science monuments
42,Lee Harvey Oswald's Apartment in Minsk,"Minsk, Belarus",The apartment building where JFK's assassin lived after defecting to the Soviet Union.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lee-harvey-oswalds-apartment-in-minsk,"The assassination of John F. Kennedy might never have occurred if it wasn’t for the dull nightlife of Minsk in the 1960s. Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin accused of shooting President John F. Kennedy, defected to the USSR in the early ’60s, after he was discharged from the U.S. Marine Corps. His hope was to attend the Moscow State University, but instead the Soviet authorities sent him to work as a lathe operator in Minsk. Apart from his job at Gorizont Electronics, which produced radios, televisions and electronics for space and military use, he was given Russian lessons and a government-subsidized studio apartment in downtown Minsk, more luxurious than any working class Russian could dream of. He even met a pharmacology student Marina Prusakova there, and married her in 1961. The apartment and cushy lifestyle did come with a price. As a U.S. citizen, Oswald and his wife were under constant surveillance from the neighboring apartment. A KGB agent on duty could hear the married couple’s conversation through the thin walls and there was even a peephole with a magnifying lens into their bedroom. Oswald’s life in the USSR did not pan out the way he expected. In his diary he wrote, “I am starting to reconsider my desire about staying. The work is drab, the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling alleys, no places of recreation except the trade union dances. I have had enough.” Shortly afterwards, he wrote to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow requesting his American passport back, since he never formally renounced his U.S. citizenship. The following year, Oswald returned to the U.S., along with his wife and their infant daughter. He made history a few years later, when he was accused of killing President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. Who knows, if Minsk had had in the ’60s a fraction of the night clubs, bars, bowling establishments, cinemas and restaurants it has today, history might have taken a completely different turn. The apartment is a private residence and is not open to the public, but it is possible to see the building from the outside. There are no signs indicating which unit it is. Some sources suggest the apartment was at the top right of the building while others say the bottom left. There is, however, a hostel in the same building at the top left facing the square.",assassination presidents soviet history history

At the base are several huge statues depicting weeping or stoical women, who express the pain and sadness of the mothers, sisters, and wives of their generation. It’s a very striking memorial, which benefits from its picturesque location on a small island in the river Svislach.

Nevertheless, right in the middle of town there is one peculiar attraction: a midcentury Soviet airplane. Permanently parked just off the main road down the street from the town hall, even some locals ask themselves how the aircraft ʻʻlanded” here. During Belarus’ Soviet days it was common to put large machinery on literal pedestals after they were retired, as a testament to Communist industry. You can find trucks, cars, tanks, concrete mixers and littered across Belarusian cities, but few are as striking as the Chachersk airplane. It is a Soviet Tupolev Tu-124, a sibling of the Tu-104, the world’s first successful jet airliner. These planes flew the skies between 1962 and 1980. They seated 56 passengers and were equipped with parachutes to be used in an emergency landing. Before it was decommissioned the the plane was used by the Soviet Union Ministry of Defence. Afterward, it mysteriously ended up as a ʻʻmonument” in Chachersk. The nearest airport is about 100 kilometers away. When it first arrived the airplane was used as a movie theater. Nowadays it is used as a local culture centre for exhibitions and education of handicrafts, for instance, knitting. Chechersk is easy to find on the highway Gomel–Mogilev. About 45 kilometers from Gomel you have to take right (P38 road) and after another 15 kilometers you will reach the destination. Both objects are located near the central road. Be aware that many areas around the city are uninhabited due to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl catastrophe in 1986. Thus it is not recommended to stray from the main road and venture into forests.",chernobyl airplane graveyard airplanes soviet history
46,Museum of Stones,"Minsk, Belarus",A unique park tells the geological history of Belarus in a national “map” of thousands of boulders and blue spruce.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-stones,"At first glance it seems like an ordinary park, until you notice the unusual number of boulders. This is the Museum of Stones, an open-air geological gallery created during the waning years of the Cold War to celebrate the unique topography of Belarus. The 18-acre Museum, just outside of central Minsk, gathered thousands of carefully chosen boulders from every corner of the country, including some with ancient carvings, and curated them into a singular vision. Together with molded land formations and tree plantings, the park forms a kind of large-scale national map. It was designed in the mid-1980s by a team from the National Academy of Sciences to replicate features of the Belarusian landscape, by using the placement of 2,135 stones, paths, blue spruce, and varying elevations. The ambitious project (the scale of the “map” is 2000:1 in the horizontal plane, and 100:1 in the vertical) had only gotten started at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the wake of the post-communist chaos, funding dried up, and where there had been hope for explanatory signage, docent-led tours, and well-run support facilities, there are now weedy paths, graffiti, and stolen signs. Still, the park is a popular spot for picnics and kids to climb, and many of the “exhibits” have secret stories to tell. There is a “Boris Stone” (one of several mysterious boulders that were discovered around the River Dvina with medieval inscriptions), and others with carvings of both Paganism and early Christianity. Some represent minerals commonly found in Belarus, and many, by their composition, reveal their long glacial journey from the Arctic tens of thousands of years ago. It may look like a bunch of big rocks, but first glances can be deceiving. The Museum of Stones is found just outside of the Minsk Beltway on the eastern side of the city, a short walk from the Uručča (Уручье) metro station.

In January 1966, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus built the memorial complex in memory of the hundreds of Belorussian villages destroyed by Nazis during this period, making it the most significant war memorial in Belarus. Sadly, the Khatyn massacre was not an unusual incident in Belarus during the second World War. At least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were burned, destroyed by the Nazis and some or all their inhabitants were killed as a punishment for collaboration with partisans. In the Vitebsk region 243 villages were burned down twice, 83 villages three times, and 22 villages were burned down four or more times. In the Minsk region 92 villages were burned down twice, 40 villages three times, nine villages four times, and six villages five or more times. Altogether, over two million people were killed in Belarus during the three years of Nazi occupation, almost a quarter of the country’s population. In memory of lives lost, each individual village destroyed is represented and those that have been since repopulated are honored by their names in tree sculptures, representing new life and survival. Bells ring every 30 seconds to commemorate the rate at which Belarusian lives were lost throughout the duration of the war. Possibly the most affecting piece in the complex is the statue of Yuzif Kaminsky, the only adult survivor of the Khatyn massacre. The 56-year-old was wounded, burnt, and left for dead during the killings, but recovered consciousness after the executioners had left. The statue shows him holding the body of his young son in his arms.  The memorial complex of Khatyn is situated in Logoisk region of Minsk area, Belarus 223110. There is a sign for the memorial on the 54th km of the Minsk-Vitebsk (M3) motorway.

If a blaze was spotted, the lookout would ring a bell to alert the team of the danger.

Founded in 862, Polotsk was the premier city of the powerful Principality of Polotsk, which ruled over a vast swath of Belarus in the Middle Ages. The power and influence of the principality was at its height during the reign of Prince Vseslav the Seer. In 1044, Prince Vseslav commissioned the magnificent cathedral of St. Sophia, also known as the cathedral of Divine Wisdom. Built by Byzantine architects, the church reputedly resembled St. Sophia in Constantinople, present-day Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. But through the centuries, it has undergone many changes, largely due to the tumultuous history of the region. The domes of the cathedral—seven according to historians, a defining feature of Byzantine architecture—have been lost. Both the exterior, with its graceful bell towers and the richly ornate interior, are now baroque in appearance. A model of how it is believed to have looked, when it was first built, is on display in the cathedral, showing the extent of the changes. Though much of the church has changed, fragments of its ancient masonry remain intact. Visit the church, and you’ll find some beautiful, faded frescoes, the original foundation, and the burial chamber where the remains of Vseslav and his kinsmen are believed to be interred. St. Sophia is now a Museum of Architecture. As it has excellent acoustics, it also serves as a concert hall for chamber music that regularly hosts organ recitals on Sunday afternoons.  Outside the cathedral, near the steps leading down to the River Dvina, is a Boris stone, one of the four on Belarusian soil. The one in Polotsk reportedly weighs 70 tons! Its history and significance, even today, is shrouded in obscurity. The ancient inscriptions on it have been variously interpreted as pagan or early Christian. The locals appear to agree on one thing alone, that touching the stone and making a wish makes it come true! Another legend claims that touching the stone grants you forgiveness for your sins.

It provided a crucial link in a chain of continuous, navigable waterways. An extraordinary feat of hydraulic engineering at the time of its construction, the canal is included in the tentative UNESCO World Heritage list. With a total length of 63 miles (101 kilometers), 13 miles (about 21. kilometers) of which are in the Republic of Belarus, it connects 11 rivers and seven lakes. But though the canal’s construction was an impressive engineering endeavor, its glory days were short-lived. The rapid development of railroads in the latter half of the 19th century rendered the waterway obsolete. The project was abandoned, even as it neared completion, on the last section of waterways in Poland. After lying largely in disuse for more than a century and suffering significant damage during the World Wars, the stretch lying in Belarus has been restored and is now being developed as a unique tourist attraction. The Belarusian section of the canal flows through a vast tract of virgin forest known for its untrammeled natural beauty.  Visitors on the Belarusian side can take an hour-long cruise on the “Neman,” crossing the lock gates in Dombrovka. Kayaking and canoeing are popular. It is now possible to cross the international border at Poland on a boat. Trout and grayling are, apparently, plentiful in these waters, making fishing a worthwhile pastime!

According to local legends, about a dozen crosses drifted to Turov from Kyiv during the Middle Ages, somehow coming ashore despite traveling against the river’s current. The crosses were pulled from the water and erected on the riverbank, where it was hoped they’d remain standing as a testament to their miraculous appearance. But when Soviet regime was established in Belarus, everything associated with religion fell under disdain. Officials decided in the 1930s that the crosses had to be disposed of. To prevent this, locals took down the crosses and hid them, leaving no hints about their whereabouts. Less than a decade later, two crosses again miraculously appeared from the river. They’re now held in local churches. A third one was also found in the river, but the fisherman who discovered the cross decided to bury it at the local cemetery. But it didn’t remain beneath the earth for long. The cross has been gradually emerging from the ground for years, “growing” about a centimeter annually. Supposedly, this cross that refuses to remain buried is warm to the touch all year, even during the winter. Locals say it’s a place of miracles, where people can come to solve their problems and heal their ailments. Of course, they also say these wondrous healings only happen for those with high amounts of faith. Not a long ago, a smaller “baby cross” began appearing from the ground in the cemetery as well. Though not yet as sought-after as the first cross, it supposedly has its share of miraculous healings, too. The coordinates lead to the cemetery containing two of the crosses. Four crosses are known. One is displayed inside the Church of All Saints. One is in the yard of Cathedral of St. Bishops Cyril of Turaŭ and Lawrence of Turaŭ. Two crosses are in the cemetery that is located outside the town (a short 10-minute walk from the town center).",miracles crosses christianity mystery legends religion sacred spaces statues

An avenue of linden trees leads up from the gate to the charming country mansion. Overlooking a lush meadow, where the Loshitsa River merges with the Svislach, the manor offers scenic river views. Surrounded by well-tended gardens and lawns, the estate includes fruit orchards and extensive woodlands. There is also a crop of outbuildings: a gatehouse and steward’s residence, as well as ruins of a family chapel, a stone mill, and a brewery. A manor has stood in this property since the 16th century. Owned by a succession of noble families, it was inherited by Evstafy Lyubanski in the late 19th century. He initiated large-scale restructuring of the old wooden house, adding a stone guest wing to the existing building. The manor now presented an interesting asymmetrical appearance, embellished with elements of Art Nouveau architecture, which was popular at that time. The interior of the house was elegantly furnished with period furniture, gilded mirrors, paintings, art objects, and magnificent, ceramic tiled, floor to ceiling stoves. The lady’s boudoir was oriental in flavor, with a portrait of Yadviga Lyubanskaya,  resplendent in a Chinese robe, on one of its walls. Loshitsa Manor reputedly had the first bathroom with indoor plumbing in Minsk. The park had ancient trees, some as old as two hundred years. Lyubanski, who was an amateur botanist, added rare and exotic shrubs and trees like the Manchurian Apricot and the Crimean Pine. Evstafy Lyubanski courted and married a notable beauty of the time, Yadviga Lyubanskaya.

Tragically, Yadviga’s life ended under mysterious circumstances, some say as a consequence of an illicit love affair. After her untimely death, her distraught husband left for the Caucasus, never to return. Loshitsa Manor ceased to be a family home. In the ensuing years, Loshitsa served in various capacities: an agricultural research facility, headquarters of the occupying German forces during World War II, and an office of a United Nations agency after the war. It lay abandoned and in disrepair for several decades before restoration began after the Independence of Belarus.

Parulis has a personal connection with most of the items found in the museum. A few objects on display are old boots, firemen equipment, a broken gramophone, and old photos. Many of the items were crafted locally or were passed down over various generations. A trip to this museum is certainly a different experience than visitors will find at a more traditional museum.

57,Zdravnevo,"Viciebsk, Belarus",The country estate of renowned Ukrainian-born artist Ilya Repin.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zdravnevo-ilya-repin,"On the left bank of the Dvina, some 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the Belarusian city of Vitebsk, is the country estate of Ukrainian-born artist Ilya Repin. An avenue of lindens leads from the gate through an extensive park shaded with mature trees, to a charming dacha with a tower. The tower, which has natural light flooding in through its many windows, served as the artist’s studio. Repin lived and worked in this summer house, called Zdravnevo, from 1892 to 1900, during which he completed paintings such as The Belarusian, Moonlit Walk, and Autumn Bouquet. Ilya Repin was born in the provincial town of Chuhiiv, Kharkiv Oblast, in Ukraine. His family was of modest means and as a youth, Repin was apprenticed to a local icon maker. While training at the prestigious Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg and on his subsequent travels in Europe, he was exposed to a range of artistic genres, from Classicism to Impressionism. However, Repin was searching for a uniquely Russian style of expression. Towards the end of the 19th century, Russia was deeply divided, with cataclysmic societal tensions simmering under the surface, waiting to erupt. Repin’s epic portrayal of Russian life, past and present, found expression in Realism: boldly composed, politically engaged, and with considerable psychological depth. His monumental painting, The Barge Haulers on the Volga, drew wide critical acclaim, for its powerful and truthful depiction of the poverty and hopelessness, of the working classes in Tsarist Russia. Other paintings followed with equal success. It is said, that Repin bought the estate in the Vitebsk region, with proceeds from the sale of his painting, The Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, to Tsar Alexander III, for a fabulous sum of money. Even after he moved from Zdravnevo to his permanent home in Repino, his family continued to live in the estate, till the 1930s. The property subsequently fell into disuse and disrepair. In the 1980s, restoration began on the property. Today, it is open to visitors, for a nominal entrance fee, as a House Museum of Ilya Repin. The reception rooms and bedrooms of the summer house have been furnished with period furniture, tasteful yet frugal, just as they were when the Repins called it home. The artist’s sketches, letters, books, photographs, and other personal memorabilia are on display. Reproductions of some of his paintings hang on the walls. The originals are mostly in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. The artist’s studio in the tower can be reached by a steep, winding staircase. It offers a 360-degree, panoramic view of the surrounding lush countryside. Outdoors, it is pleasant to stroll along the pathways, skirting beds of peonies and roses. There is a lily dappled pond and a bronze statue of the artist nestled amidst some shrubbery. The gazebo on a high bank of the river overlooks a wooded shoreline. Repin’s “Sunrise on the Dvina” may well have been painted from a similar lookout point on the estate. Indeed, Repin’s paintings of the last decade of the 19th century, abundantly reflect the remote and tranquil beauty of the Vitebsk region.",artists art history estates politics museums
58,Fountain of Three Storks,"Minsk, Belarus",A sculpture of graceful storks sits atop this fountain in Independence Square.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fountain-of-three-storks,"Independence Square in Minsk and the surrounding buildings were designed in the classic, constructivist style of architecture by renowned Soviet architect, Iosif Langbard. The square is immense and is designated for various public events. In stark contrast to the monumental scale and austere grandeur of the square is the beautiful Fountain of Three Storks that was installed in 2005. The fountain features a bronze sculpture of artistically crafted storks taking flight and sits on a glass dome, which is the roof of an underground mall, the Stolitsa. The circular granite base of the fountain holds the water jets. The sculpture on the fountain is an apt metaphor for the city of Minsk. The first written reference to the city can be traced to 1067, when it was a fortified settlement on the River Nyamiha. Since then, its recorded history has been fraught with turmoil. Repeatedly ravaged by war and devastating fires, the city has risen from its  ashes multiple times, renewing and reinventing itself. Today, it is a modern metropolis with a population of almost two million. The white stork is the national bird of Belarus, celebrated in local folklore as a harbinger of hope and regeneration. Each spring, the return of the migratory birds for the nesting season is welcomed with joy. Throughout the summer, stork nests are a common sight in the Belarusian countryside.  The Romanesque Red Church, which overlooks Independence Square, merits a visit as well.",sculptures history & culture architecture
59,Site of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' First Congress,"Minsk, Belarus",The secret meeting held in this building would forever change the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/first-congress-of-the-russian-communist-party,"For three days in March 1898, this house hosted the first congress of what would become the Russian Communist Party. The event was held in utmost secrecy in the Minsk, Belarus, home belonging to the railway worker Rumyantsev. All participants knew what would happen if they were caught—the cover story for the meeting was that they were celebrating the name day of Rumyantsev’s wife. No minutes were taken from any of the six sessions held but the resolutions were recorded, and a stove was kept burning in the next room so that participants could quickly destroy any information recorded, if needed. One of the participants at the First Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party was Vladimir Lenin, who was in his 20s at the time. He smuggled a draft program for the party, which he had drawn up in 1895, to Rumyantsev’s house written in milk between the lines of a book to avoid detection. Although the meeting was held without being detected by the authorities, five of the nine delegates elected by the Congress were arrested within a month. The First Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party never united the Russian Social Democracy and a wave of police repression followed the meeting. It would take years before the party functioned as intended—its second congress wasn’t held until 1903. Still, the first congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party was the seed of a movement that would forever change the world.",social movements lenin communism politics

The Hallerbos—also known as the Blue Forest—is covered with millions of bluebells from late April into May. The otherworldly transformation of the 1,360-acre woods has a floral carpet brushing up against the lean beech trees as far as your eye takes you. Visitors can stroll the winding paths, and watch for rabbits and deer that wander through the green and azure woods. While the woods, located in the Halle municipality between Flanders and Wallonia, is not far from Brussels, it’s often overlooked by visitors. The phenomenon of “bluebell forests” is not uncommon in Europe, particularly in its oldest woods, but the Hallerbos is unique for the density and beauty of its blooms. While Hallerbos is mostly known for its bluebells, the forest features nature of all kinds in every season including oak, ash, pine, beech, giant sequoia and larch trees. As well as wildlife such as squirrels, foxes and almost 100 different species of birds.  The entrance is on the Chemin du Bois de Halle off of Exit 22 on Brussels Ring Road. You can also take TEC bus 115A to the Vlasmarkt stop and take Vlasmarktdreef to the woods.

61,Royal Greenhouses of Laeken,"Brussels, Belgium",Lavish royal estate punctuated with heated greenhouses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/royal-greenhouses-of-laeken,"King Leopold II of Belgium is most well known for creating the Congo Free State in the late 19th century. When Leopold was not establishing colonial settlements and exploiting native populations, he was building lavish royal estates punctuated with tremendous heated greenhouses. The most impressive of Leopold’s creations in Brussels is the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken on the grounds of the Palace of Laeken built between 1884 and 1886. It is an extravagant creation, complete with thirty pavilions connected to the prize of the complex, the Winter Gardens. Towering over the grounds, the beautiful glass dome of the garden shines royally above all else. Inside, the beauty is no less impressive. Exotic tropical plants make up a sizable portion of the gardens. However, the standouts of the collection are the azaleas and geraniums, which, when in bloom, brightly light up the corridors of the garden, catching the sunlight and pleasing every side of the senses. Oddly enough, the impressive Winter Gardens of the complex are also called the Greenhouse of Congo and feature many tropical plants the king undoubtedly encountered during his time in Africa. This strange link between the king’s colonized territory and his excess in Belgium starkly contrast, and highlight the grim realities of the colonization Leopold essentially popularized in the late 1800s. Keeping with the exclusive and royal nature of the gardens, the Laeken Greenhouses are only open for two weeks per year in late April and early May. Fortunately, those two weeks usually fall in line with the majority of flowers blooming in the Winter Gardens. Easily accessible from the city center of Belgium. It's only open to the public for three weeks in spring.",horticulture plants architectural oddities architecture
62,Reading Between The Lines,"Borgloon, Belgium","Part modern art project, part traditional chapel, this see-through church is only substantial from the right angle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/reading-between-the-lines,"From inside the Gijs Van Vaerenbergh-designed art church known as Reading Between The Lines, the natural sunlight hits the ground in a noirish checkerboard, belying the construction’s almost completely insubstantial walls. However, from any other angle, the building seems like a solid little chapel. Basing their design on the traditionally built local chapel in Limburg, Belgium, the architectural duo created their church in 2011 in conjunction with the art museum Z33. The single-steepled house of worship is set atop a concrete foundation on which 100 layers of stacked steel forms create the semi-transparent walls. Each layer is separated from another by over 2,000 squat steel columns. The net effect of the odd metal construction is that when viewed directly from any side of the church, its walls appear to be roughly see-through. However if the viewer sees walls from a higher or lower angle, the structure is suddenly solid. All said, the welded wonder weighs over 30 tons. Effectively a giant optical illusion, Reading Between The Lines serves as not only a statement about the permanence of architecture but also the relative sturdiness of church institutions themselves by creating a quiet place of reflection where one is at once removed from and exposed to the outside world.",churches sacred spaces architectural oddities art architecture

64,Gravensteen,"Ghent, Belgium",This fairytale castle was built as a show of power but was nearly torn down thanks to its history of torture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gravensteen-2,"Constructed over the site of a much weaker looking wooden castle by a pompous count, the fairytale fortress known as Gravensteen became a house of torture and injustice from the 12th-century and was almost torn down later on due to the memory of those atrocities. While a much smaller castle existed on the site prior to the construction of Gravensteen, it was the ostentatious Count Philip of Alsace who created the lovely, if imposing fortress that remains today. The fort was originally constructed as a symbol of the power of the Count of Flanders, it was Philip, who had fought in the Crusades and seen a number of grand castles in his travels, who insisted that the walls and towers of the castle be built to such a height that their very presence would let everyone know just how much money and influence their position held. Gravensteen is often called the Castle of the Counts for this reason. Eventually, the counts abandoned their seat in the 14th century and the castle became simply a prison and courthouse. It featured multiple courthouses and subterranean dungeons in which criminals and accused simply awaiting trial were kept in unlivable conditions and frequently tortured. While the barbaric activities were abandoned as the area became more civilized in the ensuing centuries, the site never lost the taint of the horrors that were once perpetrated within its walls. By the end of the 1800s, the structure had become unsound and its reputation was doing nothing for it in the court of public opinion, thus Gravensteen was nearly razed. Luckily a preservation group realized the architectural and (however horrible) historical importance and managed to save the castle. Today, the site has been greatly restored still retaining a decorative moat on three sides, and is open to the public, even featuring a torture museum, possibly as some sort of mea culpa. Despite its grim past, Gravensteen is still one of the most stunning historic castles remaining in the world. Update May 2019: As of May 2018, the torture museum no longer exists. There were some renovations carried out and the implements of torture are now reduced to a few remaining examples displayed behind a plexiglass barricade.  The audio guide is included in the ticket price. Quite popular, the guide tells you a lively story of the castle's history. Available in English & Dutch.",torture museums castles

Essentially the Atomium is a 335-foot-tall giant iron crystal, replicated in shiny steel. It is formed by nine spheres arranged in the the shape that iron atoms take in their delta and alpha allotropes. (In iron’s gamma allotrope, there are extra atoms at the center of each face of the cube.) The Atomium is magnified 165 billion times the normal size of an iron crystal. Designed by André Waterkeyn (the director of a federation of metallurgical companies and not a sculptor by trade), one of the original ideas had been to build an upside down version of the Eiffel Tower, but in keeping with a 1950s atomic age theme, they built the Atomium. The Atomium was recently renovated and all but three of the steel spheres are available to enter and contain everything from an exhibition space, to a restaurant, to a place for Belgian school kids to have sleepovers. Nearby the Atomium is  Mini-Europe, a theme park featuring miniature replicas of European monuments.

Brussels is known as the home of “bande dessinée” or “comic strips,” specifically those targeted at a Franco-Belgian audience. The comic book culture in the area has roots going back further than many American comic properties, and a wide number of genre and independent comics have flourished in stark contrast to the American superhero boom. A number of these properties have become cultural institutions and their creators such as Hergé and Dupuy and Berberian have become internationally known figures.

Each of the works towers over the streets below some creating whole scenes with backgrounds and little pieces of implied action while others are simply character portraits. While none of the murals were painted by the original artists, the styles have been aped so expertly no one would ever know. There are currently over 50 murals dotting downtown Brussels (an area known as the “Pentagon”), and a few more of the works have also started appearing in nearby cities.

Thanks to him and his Peruvian wife, who you are surely to meet once inside, a truly interesting combination of live performance and libation awaits. As Retsin, a self-described “vampire,” describes it, his house originally housed a chapter of the Freemasons during the time of Napoleon. However during his residence in the space, he has refurbished the rich interior to resemble a living cabinet of curiosities. The walls are covered in huge portraits of vaguely sinister figures like something out of a particularly ominous nightmare, and the surfaces are covered in countless statues and figures that seem to have been collected from a wide range of eras and areas (and possibly horror dimensions). Retsin himself consideres the space to act as a sort of museum. There is also a distinctly Cuban flavor to much of the space and the events inside with rich rum cocktails served from the old bar and Latin music playing. This owes to Retsin’s professed past of textile trading in Central America. Regardless of the origins, the sense of Havana nights decadence pervades the home although it has been filtered through the morbid sensibility of a living oddity/most interesting man in the world.

70,The Doomed City of Doel,"Beveren, Belgium",This ghost town in Belgium will lose its street art when it ceases to exist.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/doel,"In the very near future, Doel, Belgium will only exist in pictures and memories. The tiny village is scheduled to be completely destroyed to make room for an expanding harbor, and even protest and the incredible street art in the abandoned town cannot stop the inevitable destruction. For 700 years, Doel stood near Antwerp along the Scheldt River in Belgium, and includes a home that once belonged to the family of painter Peter Paul Reubens. As Antwerp expanded in the 20th century, its port needed more space, and Doel quickly became a target for demolition. Trying to force residents out, the government scheduled demolitions multiple times, but were beaten by popular protests from the 1970s through the 1990s. But despite the will of the people, Doel could not be saved and in 1999, the town was officially scheduled for complete demolition. In 2007,  a campaign group called Doel 2020 set into motion a plan to ensure Doel’s survival by turning it into a haven for street artists. Since that time, residents have trickled out as artists have made their way in. The increasingly abandoned town became the perfect playground for street artists from across Europe to debut their works around Doel. Today, there are only about 25 inhabitants left of the original 1,300, all of whom are bravely flaunting mandates that they vacate their homes immediately. Meanwhile the town has been transformed into a post-apocalyptic artistic paradise thanks to the murals covering each and every building. Despite these people’s stubborn refusal to leave, the government plans to continue with demolition, at which point all traces of Doel, from residents’ homes to the the living street art, will be lost forever. You can see some lovely drone shots of Doel in this video.  Going inside of the buildings is prohibited, though it can be managed. There are police patrols from time to time, so watch out for those. The fall was a perfect time to go because of the contrast between the grey weather, abandoned buildings and the colorful plants creeping in through the windows and such. It is not possible to drive into Doel itself unless you are a resident.

By 1796, the abbey was abandoned. Built in 1146, a dozen monks and 3 lay brothers came from Clairvaux to the Walloon Brabant province of Wallonia to establish a Cistercian abbey. After a few false starts in what turned out to be less than ideal locations, abbaye de Villers started to come together, and although it took 70 years, the abbey came to fruition when the refectory was finally finished in 1267. Despite the incredibly slow start, the abbey soon showed itself to be worth the weight, over the next few centuries, it housed up to 100 monks and 300 lay brothers at a time, its grounds swelling to 100 acres. It wasn’t until the 16th century that the holy place started to lose ground. Spanish tercios, dwindling funds and a shortage of monks did considerable damage to the abbey, but it was the French Revolution that finally put the ancient monastery out to pasture. The building was completely abandoned by 1796, and when a railway line was built through the grounds in 1855, the abbey and the acreage it sat on fell even further into disrepair. Disregarded for almost 100 years, the state of Belgium finally stepped in, bought the property and began conservation efforts, which kicked into a considerably higher gear by the 1970s once it was declared an official historic site. Now maintained regularly by the Association pour la Promotion Touristique et Culturelle de Villers, its former Cistercian-style beauty is being revisited in several of the outbuildings including the dorms, kitchen, refectory, cloister, and most importantly, the brewing house. Now you can bring a picnic lunch and wander the grounds of this ancient piece of history being brought back to life. Better yet, explore as you sample some of Belgium’s finest beers in the local Le Moulin de Villers restaurant across the street from the abbey grounds.

Lesser known, however, is that the Manneken Pis not only has a female counterpart, Jeanneke Pis, but also a dog known as Zinneke Pis, who is forever lifting his leg onto a Brussels street pole. Zinneke Pis was installed on the corner of Rue des Chartreux and Rue du Vieux Marché aux grains in 1998, centuries after his symbolic master was installed in the city in 1619. Like the little boy and the little girl, the pup was created life-size, but unlike its masters, the Zinneke Pis is not actually a pissing fountain, it is simply a bronze statue. Nonetheless, the metal canine is just as cute, looking a little guilty as he lets loose on the street corner. The bronze buddy is not as well known as his masters, but if people could catch on to his adorable little face, it is no doubt that gardens around the world would be covered in peeing dog statues in no time. The creator of the dog also lives in the neighborhood, and he modeled it after his own pet, which can still be seen occasionally wandering the area. It is not known how often the real dog pisses in the street, but it can be well assumed that it is not as often as the eternally micturating Zinneke Pis. Also, it’s a boy.",peeing statues dogs statues animals

Opened in 1912 and originally equipped with torches, the caves are explored in two parts. The first is a long walk to a grand “cathedral”, followed by an hour and a half boat ride down the caves’ quiet and entirely underground river, the Rubicon. Floating down the underground river gives the impression of an entering a lost underground fairy kingdom. The history of the Caves of Remouchamps is also quite unique. Some 8,000 years ago, Paleolithic hunters sheltered themselves in the cave, and much later, the same area was used as a wine shelter, and a shelter during World War II. Throughout the cave there are a handful of remarkable sites for visitors to see. Bat sightings are a treat for guests and while drifting on the Rubicon, look closely for the niphargus, a blind, translucent shrimp. Many stalactites and stalagmites decorate the interior of the passageways, one famously noted for its resemblance to the Virgin Mary.",geological oddities caves ecosystems geology

Less graphic, but still interesting, are the exhibits following the chronological development of medicine starting with Hippocrates and covering such medical luminaries as Galen and Vesalius. Other exhibits are devoted to non-Western medical traditions such as traditional cures of African tribes and the pre-Columbian Indians.

77,Fort de la Chartreuse,"Liège, Belgium",This abandoned Belgian fortress is purposefully being left to nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-de-la-chartreuse,"The Fort de la Chartreuse is a 150-year-old fortification that once defended the Belgian neighborhood of Liège, but is now an abandoned folly that is slowly being overtaken by foliage and graffiti. Built between 1817 and 1823, the fortress rests on the grounds of a former monastery on an elevated hill in Liège. It was originally built by the Dutch army, as Belgium had not yet been founded. However, during the Belgian revolution in 1830, the large fortification was taken over by Belgian forces who used the space as a barracks. It was large enough to house 3,000 troops, but was never filled to capacity. In the ensuing years, the fort was used as a prison by the Germans during both World Wars, and subsequently the buildings were used as a hospital by the United States. After over a hundred years in service, the huge complex was simply abandoned and continues to lay empty among a portion of land that is slowly being reforested. Today the site is slowly being retaken by the surrounding foliage which creeps over the stonework like ancient ruins. Urban explorers and graffiti artists have also left their mark, making the abandoned Fort de la Chartreuse a relatively haunting gallery of ever-changing street art.",graffiti military history abandoned military
78,Tower of Eben-Ezer,"Bassenge, Belgium",A Belgian self-built tower inspired by the Bible and ancient civilizations.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tower-eben-ezer,"The Tower of Eben-Ezer is a self-built castle constructed in the 1960s by a single man in the isolated Jeker valley of Belgium. The builder, Robert Garcet, was fascinated with the Bible, numerology, and ancient civilizations. The entire seven-level tower is built of flint, and according to Garcet, was designed using ancient mystical measurements. On the top of the tower are four giant biblical animals, and the interior is full of Garcet’s biblical, archaeological, paleontological, and geological art. Even more curious is that although the tower only looks ancient, it sits on top of a vast network of truly ancient tunnels. Garcet claims to have discovered over a hundred “new” fossilized creatures and a 70 million-year-old village in the labyrinth of tunnels under the tower! Unfortunately, the village was destroyed by a mining explosion before it could be studied. A new educational space called the Le Musée du Silex (Museum of Flint) takes the visitor on a tour of the history and use of the flint stone. Individual admission allows entrance to several levels of the tower and gardens, and a xeroxed informational guide, available in French, Dutch, and English.

79,Laeken Cemetery Crypt,"Brussels, Belgium",This recently restored crypt was once plagued by liquefying coffins and exploding caskets.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laeken-cemetery-crypt,"Beneath Laeken Cemetery lies an extensive crypt whose funerary galleries stretch out in eerie silence. While never entirely abandoned, the crypt has certainly suffered its share of decay over the years, often resulting in some messy and highly malodorous situations. Laeken Cemetery is one of the oldest and most important cemeteries in Belgium. Often compared to the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, it’s the resting place of many famous Belgians and features elaborate tombs and various works of art. The cemetery also sits adjacent to the Church of Our Lady of Laeken, which houses the Royal Crypt of Belgium, where members of the Belgian royal family are buried. Unlike the lavish and dutifully cared-for Royal Crypt, however, the crypt beneath Laeken Cemetery has had a far more checkered history. Inaugurated in 1878, the underground burial galleries beneath Laeken Cemetery cover an area of more than one hectare. The crypt consists of three main tunnels that follow the pathways of the cemetery above. Light filters down from small square windows set at regular intervals into the ceiling (and evident in the pathways above), casting enough light to see by, albeit an eerie half-light that adds a distinctly creepy atmosphere to the crypt. Vaults line the walls of the quiet corridors, some occupied and others empty. The oldest date back to the 1880s, with the most recent installed in 1978. When it was built beneath the cemetery almost 150 years ago, the first coffins were made of wood. These, however, eventually broke up and liquefied inside the vaults, creating a horrific stench inside the crypt. The cemetery then made metal coffins (typically of zinc) compulsory for all crypt burials, to avoid such unpleasant scenes. Further problems arose in the years that followed, due to cases of “exploding casket syndrome.” If a casket was completely airtight, or had a defective “burper valve,” no gas could escape as the body inside decomposed. Eventually, the buildup of gases created so much pressure that some caskets exploded, sometimes with enough force to shatter the granite facades of the individual vaults. Once again, the cemetery staff had a truly nasty cleanup to take care of in the crypt. By the 1980s, the crypt had fallen into a shabby state, with cobwebs, rust, and mold creating an even darker mood inside its tunnels. For 30 years the vaults lay almost unattended, with some people referring to it as the abandoned crypt of Laeken Cemetery. The local government eventually intervened. After an investment of 4.5 million euros and a five-year restoration effort, the funerary galleries were finally returned to a more respectable state, as can be seen in this video from 2017. Still, a descent into the crypts of Laeken Cemetery remains a slightly chilling experience, even without all the cobwebs.  Laeken Cemetery is located in Laeken, a residential suburb in the north of Brussels, Belgium. The crypt lies directly beneath the cemetery, with access via a flight of stairs in the cemetery grounds. The cemetery is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tours of the cemetery and the crypt can be arranged in advance. If you visit independently, be prepared for the crypt to be closed; you might have to ask around about how to get inside. You can get to the cemetery by taking the metro to Bockstael station, or trams 62 or 93 to the Princess Clementine stop.",subterranean underground tunnels catacombs and crypts burial places subterranean sites cemeteries
80,The Lucifer of Liège,"Liège, Belgium",A marble Lucifer hides behind the pulpit of this Gothic cathedral.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lucifer-of-liege-liege-belgium,"The original structure of St. Paul Cathédrale de Liège goes back to the 10th century, but it’s been built over a few times, and today it is mostly comprised of 13th and 15th century architecture. In the midst of this Gothic marvel, filled with works of religious art, sits a stunning statue of the fallen angel Lucifer embedded in the niche of the pulpit stairs. Know in English as the “Lucifer of Liège,” its actual title is “Le génie du mal“—”The Genius of Evil.” It was carved by Belgian sculptur Guillaume Geefs in 1848, and it depicts a tortured yet beautiful young man. As idealized as his image is, he is actually a replacement of another Lucifer carved by Guillaume’s younger brother Joseph a few years prior. Joseph’s sculpture, “L’ange du mal” (or “The Angel of Evil”), was installed in the Cathedral in 1842, but church officials thought that his depiction was too beautiful and a bad influence on the church youth, so his big brother Guillaume was commissioned to come up with a replacement statue that wasn’t so … distracting. It might be easy to mistake the Lucifer of Liège for one of the saints that ring the front of the pulpit, where Peter, Paul, Hubert, and Lambert reside. But the details reveal his true identity—the curved walls at his sides are bat wings, the apple at his feet has been bitten, his chained toes are sharp like claws, and small yet tell-tale horns emerge from beneath his hair. Liège is about 60 miles east of Brussels in the French speaking part of Belgium, not far from the borders with Germany and the Netherlands. The Cathedral of St. Paul is in the center of the city, a few blocks from the Meuse River.See website for full schedule of events and services.When you get inside, you'll find Lucifer underneath the two staircases at the back of the pulpit.",religion churches sacred spaces statues
81,Sanctuary Wood Museum,"Ypres, Belgium",A rare example of World War I trenches from the British front.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sanctuary-wood-museum,"When the Great War ended in November 1918, farmers in northern France and Belgium returned to find their fields and villages totally destroyed by four years of trench warfare. Much of the area was covered over with grass, hedgerows, and forests. Except for one place. A Belgian farmer called Schier returned to his land on a hill overlooking the ancient medieval city of Ypres, and, after clearing the trenches and craters of debris and casualties, simply left the site as it was. Once part of the British front line, the hill witnessed some of the most intense battles of the war. It lies there today looking much as it did a hundred years ago: a mess of rusted barbed wire, shell holes full of water, trees shattered by artillery fire, and a system of mud-filled trenches and tunnels. Called “Hill 62” on military maps (a reference to its elevation), it was known as Sanctuary Wood by the tens of thousands who lived and died there. The name was given in the early days of the war when the heavy woodland provided perfect cover for respite from German guns and a place to treat the wounded. Within months though, the constant artillery bombardments turned the wood into a devastated nightmarish landscape. Sanctuary Wood now operates as a memorial and museum. Climbing down into the ruins of the original trenches, it is a rare opportunity to physically understand the daily horrors of life on the Western Front. The preserved farmhouse is filled with the rusted artifacts Shier found on his property: rifles encrusted with mud, German steel helmets riddled with bullet holes, and a collection of period stereoscope photographs of the battlefield. Walking through the farmhouse into the back garden, past rolls of barbed wire and an alarming stockpile of German artillery shells, a wooden signpost indicates the way to the “British Front Line.” Just down the road from the museum and trenches is Sanctuary Wood Cemetery, where more than 2,000 soldiers are buried.",wwi war memorial preservation war history memorials cemeteries military museums
82,Basilica of the Holy Blood,"Bruges, Belgium",Christ's blood preserved in a Belgian town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/basilica-holy-blood,"The Basilica of the Holy Blood (Basiliek van het Heilig Bloed) is a 12th century chapel, in the medieval town of Bruges, Belgium, which houses a revered vial containing cloth stained with the actual blood of Christ. Or so it is believed. While the chapel itself is a beautiful site, it is the blood and its accompanying story that attracts visitors, from the devoutly religious to the deeply skeptical to those just curious to know what the fuss is all about. It is popular legend that following the Crucifixion, Joseph of Arimathea wiped blood from the body of Christ and the cloth was preserved. The artifact was kept safe in the Holy Land until the time of the Second Crusade when King of Jerusalem Baldwin III gave it to his brother-in-law, Count of Flanders Diederik van de Elzas. The Count then took the relic back to Bruges where it sits in the upper chapel of the Basilica, still unopened to this day. The vial itself is a marvel, adorned with gold and enclosed at each end by coronets decorated with angels. The chapel is open daily to visitors who wish to view the relic. On Ascension Day, a festival known as the Procession of the Holy Blood attracts residents and tourists alike. It is on this day that the Bishop of Bruges carries the cherished vial through the streets preceded by residents performing an historic reenactment of the relic’s arrival and acting out other biblical scenes. The first recorded procession took place in 1291, and some 718 years later, it is still happening.  This is a busy tourist attraction, keep in mind that on some days you may wait in line for up to an hour. There is an entrance fee of 2.50 euros. The opening times are currently 9:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. and 2:00 p.m.- 5:30 p.m.. Important: the reliquary can only be viewed between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. You are not allowed to take photos inside and re supposed to keep silent as it is a holy place.

83,Manneken Pis,"Brussels, Belgium",A little sculpture with a large wardrobe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/manneken-pis,"The corner of Rue de l’Étuve/Stoofstraat and Rue du Chêne/Eikstraat in the heart of old town is the home of one of most peculiar attractions of Brussels: A statue of little naked boy pissing in a fountain known as Manneken Pis. No one is quite sure just how and why this unimposing sculpture became so famous. There are thousands of similar fountains and sculptures scattered all over the continent, yet thousands of tourists flock each day to take a photo of this particular one. Manneken Pis is a little sculpture with a large wardrobe. The statue gets dressed in tiny costumes several times each week in one of around 1,000 different costumes. A society called Friends of Manneken Pis takes care of the costumes. The society receives hundreds of suggestions from fans each year, but only a handful gets made and used. The schedule of costumes is published on the web and on the posters plastered around the fountain. There are several legends associated with Manneken Pis. Some say that the statue was inspired by a legend regarding the 12th-century battle between troops of Duke Godfrey III of Leuven and Berthouts, the lords of Grimbergen. Little Godfrey III was only two years old when he inherited his duchy. The commander of his troops hung a basket with the little lord on a tree branch to encourage the soldiers. According to legend, baby Godfrey took a piss on the heads of Berthouts who subsequently lost the battle. Another legend claims that the statue represents another little boy, famous from another war. The story goes that Brussels was under siege in the 14th century. Enemy soldiers tried to blow up the city walls by placing a bomb near its foundations, but unknown to them they were being spied upon by a little boy. When soldiers moved away, he simply urinated on the fuse and thus saved the city from impending doom. Another story says that Manneken Pis represents a son of a wealthy merchant who one day got lost in the big city. His desperate father organized a search party and turned the city upside-down. The boy was found happily pissing in somebody’s garden. The sculpture was a gift from his father. The current bronze sculpture is the work of Jerome Duquesnoy. However, there was a similar much older stone sculpture dating back to at least 1388. The original boy was stolen several times and finally lost. Manneken Pis has also served as a model for hundreds of cheap replicas used as garden decorations all over the world, furthering the statue’s elusive, ever-growing legend. There is another Manneken Pis in the nearby town of Geraardsbergen. There has been a long feud over whose statue was the elder one, which has developed into a friendly animosity between the two respective guilds. The issue has been solved, however, as an examination of the city archives proved the Geraardsbergen version to be older. Incidentally, it was commissioned to replace a statue of a lion that, in a similar feud, had been stolen by the inhabitants of Ghent. Besides these two statues, there are more throughout the Low Countries, though most have either disappeared through time, and few have a working fountain. These statues were generally erected in honor of the tanners’ guilds, who are known to have collected urine for use in their trade since Roman times.  When you go visit Manneken Pis, make sure also to visit his ""sister,"" Jeanneke Pis! While hundreds of people visit Manneken a day, almost no one knows about Jeanneke.",peeing statues peculiar fountains landmarks statues

The venue was built around 1697 by sculptor and architect Jean Cosyn, who is best known for designing Brussels’ Grand Place. La Bellone (as it’s often referred to) was named after Bellona, the Ancient Roman goddess of war, whose figure towers over the main door. The facade is also decorated with motifs celebrating the 1697 Battle of Zenta, an important Austrian victory over the Turkish Empire. The house was acquired by Nicolas Bally and his wife Gertrude de Smeth immediately after its construction, though not much is known about the couple, nor how they used the estate. The building was acquired by the city in 1913 and has undergone several restorations in the 100 years since, including the 1995 addition of its distinctive glass roof by architect Olivier Noterman. Today, a hall and a covered passageway open up to a courtyard where the curved glass roof protects the house and provides a space for events ranging from exhibitions to meetings to musical performances. La Bellone also serves as a cultural center, information center, and arts library. La Bellone is open Monday and Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 12 p.m. to 7 p.m. The Bellone Café is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Saturday.

85,Black Tower,"Brussels, Belgium",A fantastical 13th-century fortification sandwiched by a modern hotel in central Brussels.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/black-tower,"With its dark pointed turret and rounded walls overgrown with foliage, the Black Tower impresses itself as an edifice right out of a fairytale. Its name, likewise, conjures up thoughts of medieval fantasy and the majesty of ancient legend. Step back, however, and 21st-century reality brutally crushes the illusion. Indeed, Brussels’ Black Tower is diminished and dwarfed by a relatively bland modern hotel building that appears to have been constructed around it. Despite the ignominy, though, the tower (known locally as Zwarte Toren or Tour Noire) still stands proud as one of the best preserved of the city’s historical fortifications. Built at the beginning of the 13th century, the tower was already obsolete by the 15th century thanks to the construction of new fortifications around Brussels. The edifice somehow survived centuries of redevelopment in the area around Saint Catherine’s Church, a district of the city that became an inland port. Safely ensconced in its cozy niche, the Black Tower remains as an appealing antique oddity. It’s a true hidden medieval treasure, right in the middle of the modern city.  The Tower sits in an open public square and you can walk behind it and all the way around it. The Tower isn't far from Grand-Place (about five-minutes' walk).

Beernaerts recognized the vast difference between learning to dive in the blue lagoons of the exotic island regions and learning in a dirty, shallow pool in the city of Brussels. He wanted to instill an immediate love of diving in those who did not have the option of traveling to some far-off vacation spot to enjoy the underwater world, so he brought an underwater world to Belgium, by creating Nemo 33. Its deepest level reaching 113 feet down, Nemo 33 was once the deepest indoor swimming pool in the world. With simulated caves, several platforms, and the 33-meter deep cylindrical pit, Nemo 33 provides a place for novices and veteran divers to learn and enjoy themselves in a clean and exciting environment. While it still isn’t Bora Bora, the facility is extravagant and multi-purpose, used for recreation, several different diving instruction packages, military training, and film production.

The building in Cinquantenaire Park in Brussels was commissioned from architect Victor Horta in 1889. Although Horta would later be renowned as a great influencer in Art Nouveau, here it just creeps out in his version of a Greek temple. But look closely and you’ll find no straight lines and each seemingly classical detailed altered in an organic feeling way. The temple was meant to hold Jef Lambeaux’s “Human Passions” relief, depicting a startling tableau of war, rape, and violence. However, Horta and Lambeaux almost immediately didn’t get along. Horta wanted the Temple open so that the relief was always visible; Lambeaux wanted a wall. The sculpture also wasn’t exactly getting rave reviews, with L’Art Moderne in 1890 describing “a pile of naked and contorted bodies, muscled wrestlers in delirium, an absolute and incomparable childish concept. It is at once chaotic and vague, bloated and pretentious, pompous and empty.” The Temple remained unfinished even for the celebratory Brussels International World’s Fair in 1897. Finally a barricade was built up around the Temple, but it remained much longer than intended. It was finally opened to the public in 2002, but even now is only open an hour a day, and not on Mondays. Temple of Human Passions is open a few hours every Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Dr. Guislain, the museum’s namesake, defended the rights of the mentally ill and laid plans for decent and humane treatment back in 1828, when patients were still being tied up with chains. A statue of Dr. Guislain can be found on Begijnhoflaan. The museum hosts exhibitions of the work of the mentally ill, including a current display of the Serbian painter, Goran Djurovic. They also curate exhibitions that examine how we relate to each other as people, including a current fascinating retrospective of how a man looks at man, called “People on Show.” In addition to rotating exhibitions, the museums houses three permanent collections: (1) a comprehensive history of psychiatry, (2) a catalog of photographs of the mentally-ill dating back to 1860, and (3) a collection of outsider art. The history of psychiatry chronicles ancient treatment, from both Greek and Eastern histories (trepanning tools to Hippocrates to exorcisms), through the present-day use of psychotropic drugs. A fascinating computer module lets the visitor administer a variety of tests, including one from the late nineteenth century. The museum also includes a small collection of medical models related to psychiatry. The history includes information about the Anti-Psychiatry movement as well.

The equation of time is one of thirteen fascinating dials displayed on the Centenary (Jubilee) clock affixed to the former keep. Other dials demonstrate the metonic cycle, solar cycle, lunar cycle, and zodiac among others. Incidentally, the clock tells the exact time as well. The clockmaker Louis Zimmer presented the timepiece to his native town in 1930, in honor of the 100th anniversary of Belgium’s independence. The clock displays its varied time-related information through elaborate drawings, steady hands, and mechanical globes. Every quarter hour, three statues on the tower’s wing, representing three phases of human life (child, adolescent, and adult) strike the bells with a fourth figurine (old man) joining on the hour. The sides of the Zimmer Tower show the four stages of life, each featuring a different person or character, including writer and activist Anton Bergmann and metal worker Louis van Boecke. At noon, a celebratory parade consisting of past kings, mayors, and burgomasters takes the onlooker through Belgium’s first 100 years of independence. The first floor of the tower houses Zimmer’s extraordinary Astronomical Studio. Built concurrently with the Centenary clock over a period of five years, the studio is comprised of a planetarium with a revolving disk on the ceiling replicating the Northern hemisphere.  The tower’s gear mechanism takes up the entire second floor. All thirteen faces are controlled by a single master clock that adjusts the 75 dials every 6 seconds. In 1960, the town dedicated a tower pavilion adjacent to the tower to accommodate Zimmer’s Astronomical Clock. The clockmaker’s tour de force is 16 feet high and weighs over 4,500 Ibs. It contains 93 dials, one of which, recording the period of precession of the Earth’s axis, holds the world record for slowest clock pointer. It will take 25,800 years to complete a full revolution.

While following the well-trodden trail, you’ll come across wooden artwork tucked among the trees. Their vibrations, clicks, and ability to warp ambient noise make for a surreal walk through the woods. The Klankenbos Sound Forest uses auditory and aesthetic art to create an unusual experience. In the decade since it was started, its 17 different installations have manipulated sounds in unique, innovative ways that both delight and unsettle those who wander through. Exploring the whole of Klankenbos will take around two hours. Every single work of art contains its own sonic surprises. The medley of innovative items forms a sort of choose-your-own auditory adventure. Each structure is a sight to behold, but the real treat comes from those you can climb inside. Walk into weathered huts that seem to vibrate and buzz of their own accord. Climb inside an oversized metal cylinder, where you can feel the sonar waves pulse through the enclosed air. Descend into a soundproof glass tunnel-like structure, where the usual sounds of the forest are replaced with an eerie, unnatural silence. Take a seat in a chair wedged between two sounding boxes that amplify nearby noises. In addition to the permanent structures, temporary exhibitions sometimes pop up as well. The sound park is free and open to the public at all hours.  A brochure with a map of Klankenbos and information about the sound installations is available at the Klankenbos information point Radio Forest, in exchange for a voluntary contribution. At each installation you will find an information panel. You can also explore Klankenbos with the free GPS-controlled Klankenbos app. There are guided tours available and for the kids, there are scavenger hunts and workshops. More information is found on the website. There are two brasseries at Klankenbos, Scoutsrally on the forest side, Oud-Dommelhof on the parking side. At the Scoutsrally outdoor playground is also where Laura Maes' installation Liglicht is located.",sounds forests trees ecosystems plants art
93,St. Anna's Tunnel,"Antwerp, Belgium",Rare wooden escalators lead deep down into an otherwise staggeringly monotonous tiled tunnel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-annas-tunnel,"Majestic wooden escalators lead you deep down into a tunnel that stretches beneath the Scheldt River. They’re the highlight of the otherwise staggeringly monotonous 1,876 feet of ceramic tiles that backdrop your walk from shore to shore. The escalators were made in the 1930s. They were a novelty then and still are now, thanks to the rarity of wooden escalators. The beautiful woodwork is remarkably preserved, making this a real treat for anyone tired of the modern, more unsightly escalators that dominate pretty much everywhere else. St. Anna’s Tunnel was built to connect the newer parts of Antwerp with the older portion of the city so locals wouldn’t have to rely on ferry service alone. Originally, plans were made to build a bridge over the river. But this would’ve gotten in the way of the many ships that cruise the waterway, so officials decided to build under rather than over it. As with many European structures, the tunnel was badly damaged during World War II. The passage has since been repaired, and it and its unusual escalators are still frequently used by pedestrians and cyclists as they go about their daily commutes. As you go down the escalator, visitors will see some pictures on the walls displaying the tunnel’s history and how it was built.  There's actually some nice places to discover at ""Linkeroever,"" the other side of the Scheldt. Keep the river on your right, and follow the trail for about half a mile toward a small beach called Sint-Annastrand, that might even lose some of its grimness during summery days. And there's also a hilarious 6D cinema!",woodwork stairs trails tunnels subterranean sites
94,Potato Vending Machine,"Heuvelland, Belgium",Because sometimes you need to make a batch of frites even when the stores are all closed.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/potato-vending-machine,"Potatoes occupy an exalted position in the cuisine of West Flanders and Belgium in general. Frieten or frites—what people in other parts of the world call fries or chips—are a culinary staple. They can be drenched with mayonnaise, devoured alongside a wide array of friterie offerings, or used as a base over which to pour stoofvlees or carbonnades, the classic Flanders beef and beer stew. But what if you need some spuds after hours? Well, you’re in luck—rural Belgium has you covered. Vending machines have sprouted up in small villages around the countryside, where anyone can purchase potatoes and onions around the clock. This automaat is outside Wijtschate, a quiet village that was reduced to rubble by four years of fighting in the Ypres Salient, an area within Belgium that saw some of the most intense fighting during World War I. During the war, the British forces took to calling the village “Whitesheet.” Wijtschate isn’t the only place you can spot a potato vending machine. Germany, France, and Scotland have caught on to the idea as well. The growth of these unusual fast-food options appears to be in response to a desire for local, organic food, as well as being an economical way for farm markets to extend their hours without having to pay a staff member to constantly be on sales duty. Automaten with fresh sliced bread from local bakers as well as strawberry vending machines are also popular and have been around for many years. Update as of August 2020: The machine is now located outside a farm a short drive from the junction listed. Follow the narrow road and take a signpost right turn.  The GPS coordinates lead to the junction of Ieperstraat and Langebunderstraat. A sign there points to the vending machine.",onions vending machines potatoes roadside attractions food
95,Commemoration of Peter the Great's Vomit,"Brussels, Belgium","When you're a great Russian Tsar, even your vomit gets a statue.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/commemoration-of-peter-the-great-s-vomit,"In Parc de Bruxelles, across from the Royal Palace in Brussels, there are two odd, 8-meter pits on either side of the path. Walk over to the pit on the left hand side, but know that this isn’t the best part of town; it apparently has been the site of prostitution for centuries. So why does it have a commemorative statue dedicated to Peter the Great? This is where the great Tsar once ralphed. The story goes that on April 16, 1717, Tsar Peter Alexeyevich wasn’t feeling so well after a night of revelry. Around 3 PM, while being shown about town, the great leader sat down on the edge of a fountain and puked. Even the best of us have our bad days. In the 1800s, previous structures were razed to make room for the Parc de Bruxelles (also known as Le Bassin Vert, or the Green Basin). The two natural pits in the earth were large enough that the designing committee elected to leave them as is rather than filling them in. Taking a cue from their Western neighbors, they designed a fashionable English garden, complete with a sculpture park. In 1856 Prince Demidoff donated a statue to commemorate Peter the Great’s visit to Brussels, and included a small inscription on a basin noting the details of the incident in botched Latin: “INSIDIENS MARGINI HUIUS FONTIS, AQUAM NOBILITAVIT LIBATO VINO,” which translates to, “As he sat on the edge of this fountain, he enabled its waters with the wine of his libations.” The basin and its inscription are no longer there, as the statue has been vandalized repeatedly over the past century and a half. Those in the know remember though: this is the spot where the Tsar lost his lunch.  The closest Metro station is Parc, just a short walk away.",sculpture gardens royalty parks sculptures

It’s the size of a supermarket and divided into eight different sections, heavily decorated with kitsch and glamour. A full Airstream caravan sits inside the travel section, while myriads of superhero toys adorn the walls of the comic book entryway. Marklin’s largest model railway track winds through the children’s section. Ornate furniture and vinyl records decorate the inside of the Rock n’ Roll room. A few more steps further, and you’ll find the greenhouse for the store’s nature collection, and then you’ll see a small, refurbished Fiat inside the cooking section, La Cucina. Lastly, a British section ends the shop, and spills out to the outdoor dining area where you can grab a drink and a snack.  The bookshop is buried on the outskirts of Brussels, nearly outside city limits. However, the Metro lets you off right at the entrance if you get off at Roodebeek, as does Bus 178.",bookstores
97,Jeanneke Pis,"Brussels, Belgium",Brussels' favorite peeing boy has a sister.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jeanneke-pis,"Nearly everyone who has so much as stepped foot in the city of Brussels has heard of the city’s trademark statue Manneken Pis, but few have heard of its counterpart, Jeanneke Pis. Squatting at a height of a little under a meter, this modern statue portrays a small, pigtailed girl with her knees spread while happily urinating. This limestone memorial was originally created by Denis-Adrien Debouvrie in 1985 and officially unveiled in 1987. Because it is such a new addition to the city’s history, Jeanneke Pis remains widely unknown to travelers who do not live in Brussels. The statue is located across the street from the Délirium Café on the nearly-hidden Impasse de la Fidélité near the Rue des Bouchers, which may also explain its lack of popularity in comparison to Manneken Pis. The girl is also (perhaps mercifully) afforded greater privacy than her male peer, as anti-vandal iron bars now cover her cosy niche. A visit to Jeanneke Pis can also be an altruistic one as passersby are encouraged to throw coins into the fountain beneath the squatting girl. The money goes towards a cancer research charity. To find the urinating girl, look for the Impasse de la Fidélité alley off Rue de Bouchers (not far from Grand Place and the Royal Gallery of Saint Hubert arcade).

98,Théâtre Royal de Toone,"Brussels, Belgium",Drink among marionettes at this pub inside a historic puppet theater.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/theater-royal-de-toone-puppet-bar,"Just steps away from the crowds of the Grand-Place, down an alley marked with the word Toone and two cherubs, lies a nearly 200-year-old puppet theater. Founded in 1830, the Théâtre Royal de Toone still offers several shows each week. For those who want to pair their puppetry with exceptional Belgian beers, its space is also home to a pub that lets you drink among the marionettes. According to Toone’s current owner, Nicolas Géal, Brussels had around 50 puppet theaters in the 19th century. Marionettes were often used to perform satires, as artists believed it was safer to filter biting commentary through the innocuous face of a doll. Today, the marionette theaters of Brussels have all but disappeared, but Toone keeps the tradition alive. Its 1,400 puppets perform classics such as Romeo & Juliet, The Three Musketeers, and the Nativity story. After the curtain falls, thirsty audience members can head to the adjacent pub. While the show may be over, the theater’s “stars” still dominate the creepy-cozy space. Dolls dangle from the rafters; decapitated, mustachioed puppet heads peer down from above a door; and, on a small, spotlit stage, two swashbuckling marionettes freeze mid-duel. In addition to its diverse array of dolls, Toone also has an impressively varied beer list, from refreshing blondes and tart, cherry krieks to full-bodied browns and offerings from almost all of Belgium’s Trappist breweries.  If you haven't hit your puppet quota, there's also an on-site museum that features many of the theater's dolls. It's opened up during intermission at performances. There are shows on Thursday and Friday at 8:30 p.m., and Saturday at 4:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Unless otherwise noted, the shows are in French.",puppets theaters beer victorian bars Unique Restaurants & Bars
99,Cycling Through Water,"Genk, Belgium",This bike path was sunk below water level for maximum wonder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cycling-through-water,"What do you give the cyclist who has everything? In Limburg, a Dutch-speaking province of Belgium that has built extensive bike paths and bills itself as a “cycling paradise,” the answer is a bike path that makes you feel a bit like Moses. The Cycling Through Water bike path cuts clean through a pond in surrounding Bokrijk Park, giving riders the feeling, for about a tenth of a mile, of zipping through two neatly parted seas. The contrast of the path’s straight lines amid natural features makes for dramatic contrast. And, as the 200-meter path is sunk nearly five feet, it puts cyclists eye level with the surrounding water. In summer, people enjoying Cycling Through Water may find themselves making eye contact with a duck paddling by. In winter, they have an up-close view of the sky’s reflection in the frozen pond’s glassy surface. Opened in 2016, Cycling Through Water is part of a larger initiative to attract tourists to the region with outdoor art and world-class cycling infrastructure. While urban planners and cycling advocates in much of the world do battle with planning boards to set up bike lanes and protect them from traffic, Limburg is hatching new ways to make biking delightful, even if that means building bike paths among the treetops. As a representative of the local tourism bureau told Time, when the magazine picked the path as one of its Greatest Places of 2018, “We do not want to create more miles, we want to create better miles.”  The cycling path, which is free and always open, is located near bike junction 91. It is near attractions and things to do such as hiking paths and an open-air museum. The local tourism bureau also suggests several bike routes that incorporate Biking Through Water. The area has many bike rentals, including for e-bikes that are also welcome on Cycling Through Water. Cycling Through Water is also close to multiple bus stops, including Bokrijk Domein.",biking transportation water architectural oddities architecture
100,The Yorkshire Trench,"Ypres, Belgium",In an area where the remnants of WWI are discovered on a regular basis this preserved frontline trench may be the most amazing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-yorkshire-trench-ypres-belgium,"The First World War may be a hundred years old, but repercussions of the “war to end all wars” are still keenly felt for the inhabitants of Flanders where farmers ploughing their fields routinely unearth unexploded shells, grenades, barbed wire, shrapnel, and remnants of the trenches. In the Ypres salient in Belgium, where hundreds of thousands of men were thrown into some of the deadliest fighting on the Western Front, the British and Germans fired an estimated 300 million shells at each other which never exploded, and lie hidden under the now silent fields. The so-called Iron Harvest in 2013 alone unearthed over 160 tons of deadly artifacts. In fact there were so many recovered shells that the Belgian government created a daily pick up service where farmers could leave their deadly discoveries by the side of the road to be picked up, and safely delivered to a specialist bomb disposal service in Poelkapelle. Since the end of the war, over 260 people have been killed by disturbing unexploded bombs around Ypres alone, most recently in 2014 when two construction workers accidentally detonated a 100 year old shell. But alongside the daily harvest of unexploded artillery, it’s also commonplace for farmers and construction workers to unearth more gruesome discoveries. One such was on an industrial site in the village of Boezinge, just outside Ypres, where work was being done on the Ypres-Izer canal. Here in 1992 a section of the British front line was discovered, along with the remains of 155 soldiers. The trench had been dug and held by units of the 49th West Riding Division from Yorkshire in 1915, and was fiercely fought over for the next two years. The company official record stated that, “…frontline is in dreadful state. Line only held by a series of outposts disconnected from each other. Trenches mostly falling to pieces and drainage very different.” It is thought that the majority of the 155 men who were found there died on the morning of July 6th, 1915. When such a discovery is made the Commonwealth Graves Commission is called in to see if the remains can be identified. A team of archaeologists known as “The Diggers” then go to work to unearth and preserve the site. The trench has been left intact as it was in 1915, with sandbags, duckboards, fire-steps and loopholes. The trench system also has dugouts which in wet weather are still flooded, some reaching below ground to the depth of 30 feet. At this point of the line, the German front line trench was only 100 yards away. Today visitors walking through an anonymous looking industrial estate in a small village in Belgium will find a poignant and moving reminder to the daily horrors of trench life in World War I and a living memorial to 155 young men who never returned to West Riding in Yorkshire.",wwi military history military
101,Smedenpoort Skull,"Bruges, Belgium",The bronzed skull of a beheaded traitor was affixed to the city gate in the 17th century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/smedenpoort-skull,"The medieval Smedenpoort, or “Blacksmith’s Gate,” dates back to 1297, and is one of the four remaining city gates of Bruges. Look closely at the upper lefthand corner above the arch and you’ll notice a morbid curiosity: A bronzed human skull is affixed to the gate’s yellow brick facade. It is a replica of the skull of an executed traitorous statesman whose head was prominently displayed as a warning to the people. In 1691, hostile French troops had gathered near Bruges but could not infiltrate the city’s ramparts. They conspired with Belgian statesman François van der Straeten to enter the city through the Smedenpoort. Unfortunately for the conspirators, the plot was discovered and relayed to the city council. François van der Straeten was arrested on June 26, 1691, and hanged. His head was dipped in bronze and then hung from an iron pin on the gate as exemplum justitiae. The skull disappeared during the French Revolution and was rediscovered in 1876. The remnants of the original skull are housed in the Archaeological Museum in Bruges, and a bronze replica now hangs on the Smedenpoort.  The gate that stands today was rebuilt in 1367 in place of the original 1297 gate. It has been restored several times over the centuries. The skull that hangs on the gate is a replica of the original. The Smedenpoort is located on the edge of the west side of the city. The other western gate, Ezelpoort, is about 2 kilometers away. The other two original gates are located on the eastern side of town: Kruispoort, at Langestraat 191, and Gentpoort at Gentpoortstraat.",execution skulls medieval history architecture
102,Cemetery Dieweg,"Brussels, Belgium",Nature is slowly overtaking this disused cemetery on the outskirts of Brussels.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cemetery-dieweg,"The Cemetery Dieweg was constructed after a cholera epidemic ravaged Belgium in 1866. As the population grew and other cemeteries closed, Dieweg became overcrowded and the cemetery was abandoned in 1958. A few decades later during the 1980s, the cemetery fell into a state of decay. Its maintenance was then limited to the pathways, which left the upkeep of the graves to the families. Ever since, nature has reclaimed many of the tombs, as they are covered in ivy and weeds. This creates a unique atmosphere and makes the cemetery one of the more unusual places in Brussels. Although the cemetery isn’t functional anymore, a few exceptions have been made. For example, the famous cartoonist Hergé, from The Adventures of Tintin, was buried here. Every so often, a burial takes place in the cemetery. Recently, plans have been made to maintain certain important gravestones. After all, architectural styles with funerary art dating from the late 19th-century to the 1950s are richly represented throughout the burial site.  The entrance of the cemetery is located on the Dieweg, which is a 15-minute walk from the Uccle-Calevoet train station.

103,Vlooybergtoren,"Tielt-Winge, Belgium","The ""stairway to heaven"" lookout tower was built to resist weather, arson, and the laws of physics.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vlooybergtoren,"When passersby point at the Vlooybergtoren in the town of Tielt-Winge, Belgium and say, “Lookout,” it’s not because the large metal staircase is about to fall—even though it looks like it should. The Vlooybergtoren, built in 2015, replaces a wooden lookout tower that was, for many years, a favorite place to climb up and take in the view in town. Vandals set the former tower on fire, so when the Vlooybergtoren was commissioned, the conditions were that it had to be made of metal and vandal-proof. The perplexing, seemingly gravity-defying nature of its design is just icing on the cake. Designed by the Belgian engineering firm Close to Bone, the top platform of the staircase tower offers a view of the stunning landscape, including nearby Kabouterbos (“Fairy Tale Forest”). It has been called both the “stairway to nowhere” and the “stairway to heaven.” The structure weighs 13 tons and the top platform is 33 feet (10 meters) off the ground with nothing supporting it. Only the bottom platform makes any contact with the ground. Most who visit it wonder how this is possible. That would be because the bottom portion of the tower is very heavy and very strong. From there, the railing walls, functioning as light but sturdy structural beams intended to resist forces acting on the structure, including gravity, and keep it stable, extend out and into the air. They prevent the peculiar structure from dangerously sagging or tipping. Two vibration dampeners keep the Vlooybergtoren from shaking due to foot traffic up and down the stairs, or strong winds. The steel of the walls is galvanized to prevent corrosion and covered with weathering steel to protect it from the elements. It has the same rusty color as local ironstone, a deliberate reference that does not indicate that the metal is in danger of falling apart. Or, despite all appearances, falling over. TheVlooybergtoren gained popularity after being shown on the Belgian TV show Callboys, which shot a few scenes at the staircase in 2016 and 2019. Update July 2018: The tower has recently been damaged by an explosion caused by vandals. The base structure wasn’t damaged, so city council is looking to improve the tower. There are plans to make it even higher, and it’s said they may construct a new tower somewhere in 2019. Update May 2022: The tower has been fully renovated and is once again accessible.",engineering towers architectural oddities architecture

Resting in the Verbeke Foundation Art Park near Antwerp, Belgium, the cozy anatomical model was the work of Dutch designer Joep van Lieshout. The slim, curved interior of the furnished anus features a double bed, windows, heating, and of course, working plumbing. The exterior of the room is sculpted with bulging veins and a giant puckered sphincter (non-functional) on one end, and painted the visceral red of exposed organs. The colossal muscle tube almost seems out of place in the idyllic art park, near a placid pond, yet it is composed of soft, natural angles, no matter how gross. Despite the stomach-churning imagery, visitors still flock to the site to spend the night in the big colon which is also surrounded by such wondrous sites as black swans and an unobstructed view of the night sky. Hotel Casanus is somewhere between theme bed and breakfast and gross-out stunt tourism, but whatever the draw, guests can’t help butt visit.  One night in Hotel Casanus, Joep Van Lieshout’s installation, costs €120 for two people. Breakfast and access to the museum are included in the price.

Its only patrons were members of the monarchy of Belgium and their esteemed guests. Built in 1887, the station and its accompanying waiting house were King Leopold II’s idea. Known as the “Builder King,” he commissioned buildings and public works projects throughout Brussels. The royal train station is on the smaller scale when compared to his other grand ideas, but that doesn’t mean the sculpture-topped building is any less impressive. But sadly for this sliver of royal infrastructure, trains haven’t whisked royal passengers to or from the station in over a decade. The last train departed in 2001, and the tiny transportation hub has been abandoned ever since. It’s possible for adventurous urban explorers to catch a peek of the depot on its sad, lonely spot next to the tracks. Defaced by vandalism and marred by years of neglect, the once-stately station now has a forgotten feel. Be sure you admire the structure from the appropriate side: The wall next to the station marks the border of the Royal Domain. Don’t try to climb over it, unless you want to dine with the King (and face the repercussions for trespassing).  Be careful when visiting because the train line is still very much in use today, even though trains don't stop at the station. Urban explorers will realize they need to climb a wall to actually see the historic station. As of 30 November 2019, this is the best way to get there: Head south on Chausèe de Vilvordi and make a right on Rue Albert. Find parking anywhere nearby. Walk back to the intersection of Chausèe de Vilvordi and Rue Albert, where you will find an unpaved beaten down path parallel to Rue Albert with an upward incline going to the train line. As you hike up 60 meters, across the train line, you'll be able to see the outer facade of the royal train station.",royalty trains infrastructure abandoned

They’re not grooving to a live band, jukebox, or playlist. At Cafe Beveren, they’re moving to the music played by one of the city’s last functioning Decap dance organs. In the early 20th century, Belgian dance halls buzzed to the beat of mechanical, multi-instrument “organs.” These self-playing mini orchestras became so popular that design firms found themselves building more compact versions to fit inside smaller venues such as cafes and bars. One such firm was Gebroeders Decap Antwerpen (Dutch for “Decap Brothers Antwerp”). It’s Decap’s 1937 dance organ, complete with an accordion, drum set, and saxophone, that sits in Cafe Beveren today. While these devices have largely disappeared, replaced by jukeboxes and music-streaming services, Cafe Beveren’s organ still attracts both nostalgic older generations and younger customers who come for the cheap beer, dancing, and quirky, no-frills vibe. And, like the drinks, playing a song is very affordable: Anyone who wants to hear a tune can simply drop a one-Euro coin into the organ’s control box, then watch the instruments come alive.",music history bars Unique Restaurants & Bars music
108,Stari Most,"Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina",Bridge that died in war and was resurected.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stari-most,"The Bosnian War of the early 1990s had many victims, both human and architectural. One of the best known among these was the Old Bridge of Mostar. Once one of the most iconic landmarks of Bosnia and the old Yugoslav federation, the bridge was destroyed by Croatian armed forces on November 9, 1993. The bridge, a masterpiece of Ottoman Turkish architecture, was commissioned by none other then Suleiman the Magnificent, and designed by Mimar Hayruddin, a student of the famous Mimar Sinan. The construction began in 1557 and took nine years to complete. Elegant in its simplicity, the bridge consists of a single 30-meter-wide and 24-meter-high arc, connecting the steep riverbanks of Neretva river. Two towers protect the entrances to the bridge. These massive stone structures stand in sharp contrast to the streamlined silhouette of the bridge, only emphasizing its beauty. The surrounding city of Mostar even owes its name to the bridge, “most” meaning bridge in Serbo-Croatian. After the end of the Bosnian War, the bridge was reconstructed from 2001 to 2004. Much of original stone were salvaged from the bottom of the river. The rest was replaced with new blocks quarried from the same locations used for the original construction. A coalition of international organizations led by the World Bank and UNESCO financed the reconstruction. Diving into river from the highest point of the bridge has been a test of courage for local young men for as long as anyone can remember. Tourists can pay locals to make the dive for their viewing pleasure. Official annual bridge-jumping competitions started in 1968 and are still held each summer. In 2015, the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series was held in Mostar.  Frequent buses from Sarajevo (3 hours). Stunning views.",bridges architectural oddities architecture

Plunging from cliffs as high as 83 feet into a natural, watery amphitheater that is almost 500 feet across, the series of waterfalls at Kravice are nestled in a natural reserve southwest of the city of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The collective impression created is one of a more approachable, kid sister to the thunderous Iguazu Falls spanning Brazil and Argentina’s border that remains less visited, and unspoiled in a way its big brother can no longer claim. The rapids at the base of the falls aren’t particularly dangerous even in the springtime, and no lifeguards are charged with policing activities. This makes the natural swimming holes at Kravice local favorites despite the water’s year-round chilly temperature. As if bathing beneath cascading waters and leaping from rock to rock weren’t enough, a rope swing has even been added for bonus kicks. With a bar on its banks, a classic mill and old sailing ship moored in the lake at its base, Kravice Falls leaves nothing wanting. Tour groups can be hired to bring you to Kravice, but part of the joy in experiencing Kravice Falls is its general lack of crowds, which means joining a large cluster of strangers bound for the falls may just defeat the purpose of the place. Knowledgable visitors instead recommend renting a car from Mostar or negotiating taxi service to and from the woods, the latter of which merely adds to the adventure by tossing in the fun of haggling over price.  Head south-west out of Mostar following signs towards Krusevo and follow the road all the way to Ljubuski. Turn left towards Studenci.

110,Watermills of Jajce,"Jezero, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This cluster of little wooden huts once ground local farmers’ wheat into flour during the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/watermills-of-jajce,"Jajce, in the central region of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is a historic city all about falling water. Famous for its enormous waterfall in the middle of town, the meeting of two rivers – the Pliva and the Vrbas – established the region in the 14th century as the capital of the then Kingdom of Bosnia.  There’s a town castle, old fortified city walls, high mountains and deep river valleys. And just downstream, in the area of the Pliva Lakes, is a collection of about 20 little huts that once served as watermills for local farmers. The little windowless huts sit on top of skinny stilts right over the gushing water. Since the flow here is spread out, by using a series of little mills instead of one big water wheel, the diffuse water power could be aggregated. Pretty ingenious. Most of the huts go back to the period of the Austro-Hungarian empire (about 1867 to 1918), and they give the impression of a little storybook village. No longer used for actual milling, the Pliva Lakes watermills draw tourists down the river from the giant waterfall in town. That one is certainly impressive with its showy 65-foot drop. But the little shingled watermills feel like they might be home to some local trolls, with their dragons hitched up out back.

111,Sarajevo Bobsleigh Track,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",A war-torn Olympic relic is being overtaken by graffiti and nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarajevo-bobsleigh-track,"Once a proud feature of Sarajevo’s 1984 Winter Olympic games, the bobsleigh track has since fallen into ruin after being the victim of military actions. The 1300-meter concrete track was completed in 1982 and featured a total of 13 turns for the lugers to navigate. The expensive public work paid off for the country after the events around the site during the Olympics garnered enormous crowds. The track was able to be reused during World Cup competitions in later years following the winter games and it appeared that the long track would continue to pay dividends. Unfortunately when the Yugoslav Wars began in 1991, the track, like the rest of the country, became embroiled in the fighting. The curled turns were used as defensive positions for Bosnian forces, and the whole of the track became pocked with bullet holes and other wounds. Today, the track still stands as a favorite spot for local graffiti artists who have decorated whole swaths of the curving lane. The Sarajevo Bobsleigh Track is a literal concrete reminder of a more prosperous time. It is currently under re-construction for future bobsleigh competitions but official guided tours are still available.  Do not wander around this area alone or without a local who knows it perfectly; there are still many unexploded mines littering the hillside. Venturing off the established paths is not advised. However, many travelers do hike this medium-difficult trek through the houses on Mount Trebević. Alternatively, there are tours which cater for those who do not want to hike or local buses which go three-quarters of the way there. You can also hire a taxi and your driver may act as your tour guide for the trip, just be patient and negotiate the price before getting in. The easiest way to reach the track is now via the recently refurbished cable car. The way is signposted with maps from the cable car exit.",olympics sports abandoned ruins

The two fractal walls of the memorial were erected in the 1970’s to remember Operation Fall Schwarz, otherwise known as the Battle of the Sutjeska. The military action took place during World War II and saw Axis forces attempt to rout a group of Yugoslavian forces and capture their leader. The complicated battle saw most of the Yugoslav forces able to escape, including their leader, foiling the Nazis’ plan, which was actually the second attempt at the same strategy. While the the Axis’ plan was a failure, it was not without tragedy. Over 7,000 people were killed, mostly just citizens who could not escape with the majority of the Yugoslavian military forces. To remember both the Nazi failure and the tragic loss of life, the abstract war memorial was constructed. Like many of the memorials constructed in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 70’s the monument is an angular abstraction constructed from bleak grey cement. However despite the tragic roots and brutalist construction, the majestic strangeness of the Tjentiste War Memorial cannot be denied. Stay on the M-20.

113,ARK D-0: Tito's Nuclear Bunker,"Konjic, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This top-secret nuclear bunker hidden in a Bosnian mountain has been converted to a modern art exhibition space.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ark-d-0-tito-s-nuclear-bunker,"Behind a seemingly ordinary house along the river Neretva outside of Konjic in Bosnia-Herzegovina lies a forgotten bunker, hidden right in the mountain. Built at the behest of Yugoslav revolutionary and “benevolent dictator,” Josip Tito, the nuclear bunker officially known as ARK (Atomska Ratna Komanda, Atomic War Command) D-0 was a well-kept secret for decades. The construction started in March of 1953 and wasn’t finished until 26 years later in September of 1979. It is all hidden behind what seems to be an ordinary house, and stretching 663 feet into the mountain with over 919 feet of rock on top of it, at the thickest point. The whole complex is built in a horseshoe shape, resembling a maze with offices, conference rooms, dorms and of course, Tito’s private rooms. It was all supported by two kitchens and a supply of oil, food. and water that could sustain the bunker for up to six months. In the event of a nuclear strike, the bunker could accommodate Tito and 350 of the most important political and military persons in the country. The importance of this facility is clear when considering the measures that were taken to keep it a secret. For one, all of the workers were blindfolded when being transported to the building site, only being allowed to remove it once inside. In September 1979, when the construction was finished, only 16 people knew of the bunker’s existence - three generals and 13 soldiers serving the facility. All of them had taken an oath to preserve the secret location. The building of ARK D-0 was costly, and not just in the monetary sense. Apart from the $4.6 billion invested in the construction, it also took a lot of lives. According to the testimonies of some of the workers, not a single shift passed without a fatality. ARK D-0 exists today only because of the Bosnian military guard, who refused to carry out an order from Serbian high command in Belgrade, who wanted to blow up the bunker up in 1992. Thanks to this forward thinking bit of preservation, the bunker is still in much the same condition as it was during the Yugoslav era with all of its furniture and equipment intact. In addition to acting as a time capsule from a more paranoid time, the bunker is also home of a contemporary art biennial called D-0 ARK Underground. So the bunker, once built for a small circle of the Yugoslavian elite and close to being destroyed forever, is the home of a contemporary art exhibition. It’s said that Tito never came to visit the bunker but one can imagine that this was not what he had in mind for the future of ARK D-0.  ARK D-0 is located in a military facility on the east side of the river Neretva south of Konjic. The area is a military compound, so you can only visit with a guided tour.

However, Bosniak loyalists built a tunnel which would secretly supply much of the rest of the city during the occupation. Begun in January of 1993 under the codename “Objekt BD,” the tunnel was built to link the Bosnian neighborhoods of Butmir and Dobrinja under a Serbian-controlled aircraft runway. The crude tunnel was dug by hand and shovel from both sides, by workers who chiseled away at the earth in eight-hour shifts. The clandestine laborers, who were paid in cigarettes, had to contend with near constant shelling and underground water which would rise to waist high in the cramped tunnel and had to be emptied one bucket at a time. The two tunnels finally met in July of 1993 creating an 800-meter lifeline between the two neighborhoods. Once completed the tunnel had an average height of one and half meters, and was shored up with tons of steel and concrete. A small railway was finally built into the floor and crucial food, gas, and weapons were finally able to be secreted into the very heart of the siege. After the war ended the tunnel was abandoned, but a museum was built in the building which covered the Dobrinja entrance. The museum displays weaponry and ephemera from the war and allows visitors to explore a short distance into the tunnel. The war may be over, but the Sarajevo War Tunnel Museum makes sure that no one will forget the unstoppable determination and resourcefulness of Sarajevo’s citizens.",tunnels military history subterranean sites military museums and collections museums

The mountaintop provided views of the entire city, and was a key point in military observation. After World War II, this lookout point proved useful again, when the fortress was converted into an astronomical observatory. The Orion Astronomical Society established the Čolina Kapa Observatory and worked hard to bring it up to state-of-the-art technological standards. By 1972, it was the only facility of its kind in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its three domes crowned the building waiting for astronomers to observe the night sky, while the fortress below contained all that visiting scholars might need for several days’ stay, including a reference library and a photo lab. Research done at the observatory led to the publishing of a photographic atlas of the North sky compiled from the images taken here. Unfortunately, two decades later in the 1990s much of Sarajevo was devastated by shelling during the Bosnian War. The astronomical observatory was no exception. The Čolina Kapa Observatory and all its instruments were completely destroyed between 1992 and 1995. The area was absolutely shattered by the conflict, and without adequate funding, the observatory was abandoned. Today it remains an important symbol of Sarajevo, as its white building still looks over the city from Mount Trebević, though today the walls are crumbling and decrepit. Though the abandoned building is a popular attraction for urban exploring hikers, most Sarajevans would prefer that the observatory be restored. Without Čolina Kapa, astronomy is virtually non-existant in Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite the fact that the study of the stars reaches back to the 15th century in the region. A fundraising campaign has been launched with the intention of “bringing astronomy back to Sarajevo.”",abandoned observatories astronomy war history abandoned military ruins
116,Museum of the Assassination of Franz Ferdinand,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",The place where WWI started.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-assassination-of-franz-ferdinand,"On the 28th of June, 1914, Sarajevo found itself in the epicenter of world politics. Gavrilo Princip, an 18-year-old school boy, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir apparent to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This act triggered a chain of events of global magnitude. Europe’s empires were on a collision course for decades, now a clash was inevitable. A month later the world was at war. On that fateful day in June, Princip did not act alone. He was part of a group composed of young men of all three Bosnian nationalities. No less than five assassins awaited the Archduke that morning in Sarajevo. The first three failed in their attempts. Princip succeeded only by chance. The first two assassins watched as the motorcade of the Archduke rolled by, and with bombs and pistols in hand, they failed to act. Finally, a third assassin threw his bomb, but the bomb bounced off the car’s roof and into the street, where it exploded and wounded the crowd. That assassin attempted to swallow a cyanide pill and jump into the river, but he promptly vomited up the pill and as the river was only 4 inches deep he was easily apprehended very much alive. Princip, who was a relatively minor player in the plot, on hearing that the assassination had failed, went to get a sandwich. It was only when he happened to see the motorcade driving by him, that he hastily pulled out his pistol and shot both the Archduke and the Duchess Sophie dead. Franz Ferdinand’s last words were, “Sophie, Sophie! Don’t die! Live for our children!” followed by him repeatedly saying, “It is nothing. It is nothing. It is nothing.” They both died seated upright in the car before they could receive medical attention. Gavrilo Princip died in an Austrian prison awaiting the conclusion of his trial. To most of the world, Gavrilo Princip was a crazy youth deluded by nationalism; fueled by a naive anarchism he became a terrorist. However, in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later in the Socialist Republic he was seen as a hero. The building on the street corner overlooking Latin Bridge, next to which Princip was standing when he fired the fatal shots, was turned into a museum dedicated to him. The exact spot he was standing was marked by embossed footprints and a memorial plaque was placed on the corner of the street. In 1941 during WWII, the memorial plaque was removed for the first time by the occupying Nazi army. During the war of the 1990’s, the public and official opinion of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand changed. To the Bosnian Muslim population, the events began to be seen as a Serbian plot imposed upon the citizens of Sarajevo. Princip was perceived as a Serb terrorist by them so the museum was shut down, footprints removed, and memorial plaque smashed. In the years following the Bosnian War, the local perception of history flipped one more time. The museum has been reinstated, this time as a museum of the Austro-Hungarian rule in Sarajevo, and a new memorial plaque was placed on the street corner.",wwi memento mori monuments museums and collections museums
117,Old Jewish Cemetery of Sarajevo,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This historic cemetery was inaccessible for several years due to dozens of land mines.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-jewish-cemetery-of-sarajevo,"This large Jewish cemetery was originally founded in 1630 and contains over 3,850 weathered tombstones. For several years, it also contained around 70 land mines. As part of the Ottoman Empire, Sarajevo became a safe haven for Sephardic Jewish refugees following their expulsion from Spain in 1492. A sizeable number of Jews had settled in Sarajevo as soon as the 16th century, prompting the building of a Jewish quarter in the city that included a synagogue, a courtyard, housing, and the cemetery. While the oldest graves here are Sephardic, the cemetery also became a burial ground for Ashkenazi Jews, who arrived in Sarajevo in the late 19th century. The graveyard is particularly notable for the unique shape of its tombstones, which bear the influence of the monumental, medieval Bosnian stećci in their block-like shapes and decorative motifs. The cemetery’s position on the side of Mount Trebevic overlooking the city made it an attractive artillery position during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Held by Bosnian Serbs, it would become the front line, sustaining considerable damage from bullets, explosions, and return-fire from the city below. Before the war’s end in 1995, the site was heavily mined. The Norwegian People’s Aid Society was assigned to clearing the explosives and would remove 60-70 land mines and around 100 pieces of unexploded ordinance before their task was done. The cemetery was finally returned to Sarajevo’s Jewish community for reopening and restoration in September of 1998.",jewish war history cemeteries military
118,Bascarsija,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",Oriental bazaar in the heart of Sarajevo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bascarsija,"Baščaršija is the main tourist attraction of Sarajevo. Located at the heart of the city, this bazaar is one of Sarajevo’s oldest areas as well as a well-preserved example of oriental architecture in the Balkans. The name Baščaršija is derived from two Turkish words, “baş” meaning “head” or in this case “main,” and “çarşı,” a commercial street. Situated along the northern bank of the Miljacka River, Baščaršija is an oriental bazaar, a maze of narrow streets with small shops where craftsmen make and sell their products. At one time, each street was dedicated to a different type of craft: metalwork, jewellery, pottery and so on. Nowadays, many of the old artisan shops have been converted to souvenir shops and cafes. Many cities and towns in Bosnia have followed the same historical pattern. Townsfolk, craftsmen and merchants whose livelihoods depended greatly on long-distance trade and good relations with the ruling power converted to Islam, while the countryside remained largely Orthodox. Like many oriental cities, Sarajevo was divided into a residential area or “mahala” and a commercial zone or “çarşı” (a “čaršija” in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian.) By Balkan standards, Sarajevo is a relatively new city, founded after the Ottoman conquest. The history of Baščaršija begins in 1462, when Isa-beg Ishaković, Ottoman governor of Bosnia, built a caravanserai, a kind of oriental roadside service station where travellers could find lodging, fodder for horses, exchange money and repair their carts. The golden period of Baščaršija came in the 17th century, when it contained more then a thousand shops practicing over eighty different crafts. In the 19th century, the bazaar suffered a devastating fire which cut its area roughly in half. At that time Bosnia was a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and imperial authorities wanted to convert Sarajevo into a “modern” European city. Accordingly, they did little to preserve what they saw as a backwards oriental bazaar. After the Second World War, the cultural and historical significance of Baščaršija was reassessed, and it gradually became the symbol of the city again.",inventions architectural oddities architecture
119,Igman Olympic Jumps,"Hadžići, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This abandoned Olympic skiing facility still bears the scars of the Siege of Sarajevo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/igman-olympic-jumps,"The area around Igman Mountain outside of Sarajevo has been the site of cross-country skiing, the 1984 Winter Olympic ski jump—oh, and some wartime atrocities. Long before the Igman Olympic Jumps were built, the area was already a popular cross-country skiing destination for the nearby locals. When the site was eventually selected as the location for the 1984 Olympic ski jumping facility, construction of a new road started in 1979, followed by the construction of the two concrete jump chutes, the judges’ tower, and the lifts throughout the following years. The completion of the facility in 1983, and the subsequent Olympic Games brought an increased interest in recreational skiing in general, but also ski jumping. However the good times were not to last. Throughout the Siege of Sarajevo (1992-1995) the area around Igman became the scene of fierce fighting (not unlike the bobsled tracks from that same Olympics). Eventually it became a part of the United Nations buffer zone between the belligerents of the Bosnian government and the Army of Republika Srpska, stretching from the Sarajevo airport and out from the city. The angular Olympic pavilion was even used as a backdrop for summary executions. Today the remains of the fighting can still be seen on the ruins of the Olympic facilities; traces of UN symbols still linger on the abandoned judges’ tower, and some of the structures are still riddled with bullet holes. Even though the ski jumping hills are unusable today, there is some activity in the Igman ski resort. Three lifts are open to give access to a handful of usable ski slopes. The Olympic podium has been restored to its original state to cover the bullet holes from the executions, restoring some of the normality to a once popular ski resort plagued by war.",olympics sports abandoned ruins
120,Garavice Memorial Park,"Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina",A forgotten and crumbling Yugoslav monument to the victims of fascism.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/garavice-memorial-park,"Just outside the town of Bihać, in Bosnia, a somber memorial park marks the place where 12,000 ethnic Serbs and Jews were executed by fascist forces during the Second World War. Axis forces controlled much of the Balkans during the war, and as borders were redrawn the town of Bihać became a part of the fascist-aligned Independent State of Croatia. In June 1941 the new mayor of Bihać, Ljubomir Kvaternik, moved towards homogenizing the town, ruling that all ethnic Serbs and Jews had to leave their homes. Many did, but a great number ignored the order. In July, the mayor called for the arrest of all those who remained. Between July and August that year, thousands of Jewish and Serb civilians of all ages were taken to sites outside the town and executed en masse. One of the largest places of execution was on Garavice Hill—and it was here, decades later, that socialist Yugoslavia would build a monument to the dead. The Garavice Memorial Park to the Victims of Fascist Terror was designed by renowned architect Bogdan Bogdanović, and completed in 1981. It consists of 15 stone columns placed around the crest of Garavice Hill, roughly 15 feet in height and each formed from a series of carved stone blocks. Engravings on the blocks show curious patterns and abstract designs, reminiscent of local folk art. Today, the memorial park is poorly maintained. Some of the pillars were damaged during the conflict in the 1990s, while graffiti stains many of the stones. Unlike other monuments in the nations of former Yugoslavia, where fresh flowers often indicate their contemporary use as memorial sites, the Garavice Memorial Park appears to be largely forgotten. Its antifascist message remains a powerful one though, for those who still choose to visit; and an engraved script on a stone near the entrance to the park reads: “Life is stronger than death, Justice is stronger than crime, Love is stronger than hate.”",communist monuments fascism communist architecture execution war memorial war history world war ii memorials monuments abandoned military architecture

During the spring of 1942 the Croatian army, Ustaša militia, and the German Wehrmacht surrounded the town of Banja Luka, and over the ensuing weeks, 80,000 civilians were wounded, 1,700 partisans killed, and 50,000 civilians were sent to concentration camps. In early July, a group of partisan forces was finally able to break the siege, but the human cost had already been paid. To honor this tragic battle, the Kozara Memorial monument was erected in 1972. Designed by Dušan Džamonja, and built atop Mrakovica Mountain on a plateau surrounded by dense forest, the segmented tower stands 33 meters high.

But since its creation the strange, graveyard has become a dilapidated dumping ground that looks like an abandoned fantasy kingdom. The sprawling stone memorial was designed by architect Bogdan Bogdanović, known for his politically-inspired abstract concrete sculptures. Finished in 1965, the cemetery holds the remains of 560 members of Yugoslavia’s National Liberation Army who were killed during World War II. The strange boneyard was designed in tiers, not unlike a rice paddy, and the gravestones are shaped like puzzle pieces. All of the burial steps lead up to a grand wall at the back of the site that has a fountain at it’s center that is overlooked by a concrete artwork that looks like gears or maybe suns. Through out the monumental cemetery are paths that lead in between tall concrete canyons that seem like something from a warlock’s labyrinth. Unfortunately, the cemetery had fallen into severe disrepair by the 1990s, with the concrete walls covered in graffiti, and trash littering every nook and cranny of the space. It was also damaged by fighting and war. In 2005 a restoration effort took place that repaired many of the monuments and works, but unfortunately the site soon fell into disrepair once again, with trash and graffiti again taking over the cemetery.

123,Sarajevo Spite House,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","Inat Kuća, or ""House of Spite,"" is more than just an oddly named restaurant.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarajevo-spite-house,"In 1878, Austria-Hungary gained control of Bosnia and Herzegovina via the Treaty of Berlin, and promptly set to work occupying the country and expanding Habsburg influence in the Balkans (which — spoiler alert — was a project that did not end well). Part of their plan involved transforming Sarajevo into a model colony where modern urban planning practices and new technologies could be tested for use throughout the empire. First, however, they’d have to overcome an unexpected obstacle: one stubborn old man. As part of Sarajevo’s makeover, Austro-Hungarian city officials began construction in 1892 on a magnificent new city hall. The building was designed to be a show of great strength and power, as well as an integrated part of the city’s new tram system. Their first task was clearing the land for the structure to be built. After demolishing several houses that would be in the way, though, they ran into a problem. An elderly Bosnian fellow named Benderija refused to agree to the destruction of his house, even after being offered more money than the property was worth. Without the land under his house, there would be no way for the city hall to be built at the desired location, right next to the River Miljacka. Lengthy negotiations ensued between the old man and the city (with even the Austro-Hungarian Minister of Finances getting involved) until finally, in 1895, he agreed to sell his property for the extravagant price of a sackful of gold ducats, but only under one condition: the authorities would have to move his Ottoman-era house, brick by brick, and rebuild it on the other side of the river. Benderija got his way; in the popular account of the story, the old man spent every day of the move sitting in the middle of a nearby bridge, smoking cigarettes and carefully watching the workers transport each brick across the river. When the house was finally rebuilt, it was aptly named Inat Kuća, or the House of Spite. Today, this proud symbol of Bosnian stubbornness serves a more practical purpose: it was converted into a Bosnian restaurant in 1997. The building is across the River Miljacka from the Vijećnica City Hall, which is now a museum. The restaurant serves traditional Bosnian cuisine 11AM-11PM every day of the week.",spite house restaurants houses homes
124,Bridge on Neretva,"Jablanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina","A bridge destroyed three times: once as a ruse, then in an actual attack, and finally for the movies.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bridge-on-neretva,"During the Second World War, Bosnia was the scene of some of the fiercest battles between the Yugoslav Partisans (the Communist guerrilla-resistance) and the Axis Powers. The Axis Powers tried, ultimately unsuccessfully, to annihilate the Partisan guerrillas in a series of fierce military operations. At times, the Axis Powers came quite close to annihilating the resistance, especially during what would be later known as the Battle of Neretva, which was the culmination of an operation codenamed Fall Weiss. The main targets of the operation were the Partisan leadership, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and the main Partisan mobile hospital. To carry out this anti-Communist operation, the Axis Powers amassed six German, three Italian, and three Croat divisions, along with several regiments of Chetniks and Serbian Royalist guerrillas, employing Italian allies. At a crucial point in the battle, the Partisans found themselves surrounded in a narrow pocket on the west bank of Neretva River, near the town of Jablanica, Herzegovina. With their backs to the river, they faced the advance of main the German force, supported by several Panzer brigades. The opposite side of the river, the east, was guarded by far inferior Chetnik forces. Despite this, the Partisans didn’t have enough time to force their way across the river. The Neretva is a swift river, flowing through mountainous terrain and impassable at most places. The only link to the other side was a single railway bridge heavily guarded by Chetnik forces. Defeat seemed imminent. The Partisans, however, staged an ingenious deception. They blew up the bridge. When air reconnaissance reports came in, the German command concluded that the Partisans were probably planning to push north along the west bank of the river, and that they destroyed the bridge in a desperate attempt to boost morale in their ranks. They immediately changed the course of their attack and started redeploying northwards. This gave precious time to the Partisan engineers to repair the bridge. The bridge had been blown up in a way that, from the air, made it look totally out of commission, while its main structure remained partially intact. The Partisans then stormed the east bank of the river and overwhelmed the surprised Chetnik forces. Despite seeing through the Communists’ plan quite quickly, the Axis Powers were caught flat-footed. They couldn’t redeploy in time. They managed to organize a Luftwaffe air raid, but the effect was only partial due to the area’s mountainous terrain. The bridge, however, was once again destroyed—this time for real, by the Luftwaffe’s bombardment. After the war, a new railway bridge was built on the same spot. The events of the battle were depicted in a 1969 Yugoslavian movie which featured well-known Hollywood actors Yul Brynner and Orson Welles, the latter in the role of a Chetnik commander. In order to realistically depict the Battle’s climactic scene in the movie’s finale, director Veljko Bulajic decided to blow up the actual bridge. He expected that the remains of the bridge would become a tourist attraction. But none of the actual shots made it into the final cut, as thick clouds of black smoke obscured the view. The scene was finally shot with a scale replica on a sound stage in Prague. Today, there is a museum dedicated to the battle in the town of Jablanica.",ruins

By then all buildings in the city had suffered some type of damage and over 35,000 had been completely destroyed. Many of the explosive craters left behind by the shelling were filled with red resin to mark the casualties suffered at the spot. The explosion patterns reminds some of a flower leading to the memorials being named “Sarajevo Roses.” However many of them also resemble giant bullet wounds lest anyone forget their violent origins.

Running between July 3rd, 1993 and January 9th, 1996 it even surpassed the two years of the 1948-49 Berlin airlift. 12,000 flights brought 160,000 tons of food and medicine to the people of Sarajevo but it was not always appreciated. The ICAR canned beef soon became a symbol for the shortcomings of the humanitarian help. According to eyewitness reports collected by writer David Charles, sometimes the food was leftovers from the Vietnam war that expired 20 years earlier, and sometimes it was pork, an egregious oversight when half of the population receiving the aid were Muslims. Even cats and dogs were said not to eat it. After the war the “Grateful Citizens of Sarajevo” thanked the international community through this golden, meter tall can of ICAR beef. Something other than food and medicine Sarajevo was in dire need of during the fighting was weapons. But because of the international weapon’s embargo put on the belligerents, they had to turn to Colombian drug cartels and smuggle the weapons into the city illegally. Because of this, some people say that they did more to save Sarajevo than the UN and that they should get a monument on their own.",giant food military history monuments military food
127,Mostar Aircraft Hangar,"Gnojnice, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This abandoned airplane hanger is said to have once been a top secret launch facility.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mostar-aircraft-hangar,"Like so many military installations from the Yugoslav era this aircraft hangar outside of Mostar lies abandoned, but can be still be visited by anyone looking for a bit of off-the-beaten-path urban exploring. The abandoned aircraft hangar in the village of Gnojnice outside of Mostar is a haunting arch built right into a weedy hillside. The high, cement ceiling is molded into a smooth curve, creating a huge concrete cavern filled with nothing but debris and echoes. There are exits on either end of the tunnel and giant blast doors can still be found within. According to travel blogger Cheryl Howard who visited the hanger with a local guide, the abandoned airplane garage was once a top secret facility hidden next to the Mostar airport. Yugoslavian revolutionary Josip Tito had fighter jets placed deep in the mountainous bowels of the hangar, ready to deploy. The natural fortress protected the planes from attack, as well as from the prying eyes of citizens and spies. Today the hangar lies abandoned in complete darkness with debris and broken glass everywhere. The old, abandoned cavern is not an official tourist attraction, but for the determined, this little bit of top secret history can be sought out.

Built at the end of the 16th century by the well-known court architect Mimar Koca Sinan, the bridge is a triumph of Ottoman monumental architecture and civil engineering. With its 11 masonry arches spanning 179 meters, the bridge is celebrated as a perfect example of proportion. Today, people are once again talking about the beauty of the bridge and its significance as a piece of architecture. But in the early 1990s, the bridge, included on UNESCO’s World Heritage list in 2007, was known as the site of a large number of brutal killings during the Višegrad massacre. At that time, there were so many bodies floating down the river from the bridge that they clogged a hydroelectric dam in Serbia. Milan Lukic—convicted of murder, extermination, persecution, cruel treatment, and inhumane acts against his Bosniak neighbors by a trial chamber in 2009—was largely responsible for the killings. Lukic used the surrounding area as headquarters for his rape camp, turning nearby fields, factories and, of course, the bridge into sites of abduction and massacre. While the connection to Lukic has drawn many to the bridge, it is perhaps most famous for its role in Nobel Prize-winning author Ivo Andric’s book The Bridge on the Drina. Recently declared in danger of collapse because of fluctuations in the river level, the Mehmed Pasha Sokolovic Bridge is closed to traffic. The location of the bridge is a way off from the real one.

They are futuristic, brutalist, and tell the stories of Balkan conflict. The purpose of the monuments was manifold. First, their blocky, concrete construction was meant to signify the resilience of Yugoslavian communism. The futuristic style of the spomeniki symbolized forward facing optimism for the nation. Individually, the gigantic statues commemorated an event in Yugoslavian history, perhaps a victory in battle or a tragic massacre. Some of the monuments are still in use; for example, the Kruševo Makedonium holds a museum in its belly. Others, like the Kosmaj Monument and the Mitrovica Miners Monument have been neglected, but are still regularly visited. The monument on Grmeč Mountain is completely abandoned. Moss grows in its cracks, and the only way to find it is by wandering through the forest, as no signs point the way. The name of the architect is lost to history, as is the exact revolution the rotund spomenik is meant to commemorate.

130,Old Sarajevo Clock Tower,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This historic timepiece is thought to be the only public clock in the world that keeps lunar time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-sarajevo-clock-tower,"Located in the historic old town section of Sarajevo, the Old Clock Tower is not only one of the largest in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but it is also believed to be the only clock tower in the world that keeps lunar time making it always seem like it is broken. Dating back to the 16th-century and towering next to the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque in the center of the city, the old Sarajevo clock tower is one of the tallest in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The current clockwork mechanism was installed in the late 1800’s being imported from the London watchmaking firm Gillett & Johnson, because of this it has sometimes been referred to as “Little Ben”. The arcane machinery does not follow the standard time, but instead marks time based on the movement of the sun and moon so that the locals can time their prayers, thus the clock strikes midnight a sunset in the town. The delicate astronomical measurements required to keep time with the turning of celestial bodies requires that the clock be calibrated every three days or so. This responsibility has fallen to a single clock keeper who has reset the gilded clock hands right on schedule since the 1960’s. He is honored by the task, considering it a holy calling. Since the original religious purpose behind the lunar timepiece has long since had its meaning obscured, most tourists simple think the four sides of the clock tower are keeping bad time, and even many locals are unaware of the significance of the strange timepiece, yet like the inexorable turning of the sun and moon, it is unfailingly reset despite what people think.

131,Jajce Fortress,"Jajce, Bosnia and Herzegovina",The remains of the last Bosnian fortress to fall to the Ottomans are still standing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jajce-fortress,"Jajce Fortress was the stronghold of the town of Jajce, a former royal capital and the last territorial possession of the Kingdom of Bosnia. Jajce was founded in the 14th century by Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a powerful feudal lord in medieval Bosnia. Built at the confluence of the Pliva and Vrbas Rivers, the town served as the seat of power for Hrvoje, who bore the title Grand Duke of Bosnia and was heavily involved in the political intrigues and military actions needed to protect Bosnia’s independence from her more powerful neighbors, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. Thus it is altogether sensible that Hrvoje also built a fortress atop the hill at the center of his new town, to deter foes and safeguard his own power. Hrvoje died in 1416 after shifting his alliances one too many times and being stripped of most of his lands in the process. His town and the fortress at its heart, however, still stood, and in 1421 King Stjepan Tomasevic moved his royal court to Jajce, thus making it the capital of the Kingdom of Bosnia. To reflect the city’s new royal status, a palace was built within Jajce Fortress in the mid-15th century and an royal portal was added to the complex, emblazoned with the royal Bosnian coat of arms. Jajce Fortess stood fast for another century and helped maintain the independence of the city while the rest of the Kingdom of Bosnia fell to encroaching Ottoman forces. It could not hold out forever, though, and in 1527 Jajce was finally overtaken, making it the last Bosnian town to fall to Ottoman rule. Today, Jajce Fortess still stands on top of the rounded hill at the center of the medieval city, but the tall stone walls and watch towers now only enclose a grass-covered plateau that the Bosnia royal court once called home. The fortress is a short walk from the famous waterfall at the center of Jajce.",fortresses castles medieval ruins

Bruce Lee (born Lee Jun Fan) become a cult hero, and thousands kids practiced their moves with homemade nunchaku (a Japanese weapon used in the movies, often called “nunchucks”). Before the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, the city of Mostar had a population nearly as large as that of all three Bosnian nations. When the war erupted, the Serbian community was quickly driven out, leaving Muslims and Croats to fight over the city. Years after the war, Mostar is still a divided city. The Bosniak Muslim population inhabits the eastern side of the Neretva River, while the west bank remains almost exclusively Croat. The love and memory of Bruce Lee, however, is one of the rare things that still unite all its people. To commemorate this, the people erected the world’s first statue of martial arts legend and philosopher Bruce Lee. The idea for the monument came from the Mostar Urban Movement youth group. And on November 26, 2005, a life-sized bronze statue by Croatian sculptor Ivan Fijolić was unveiled in Zrinjski City Park on the western side of Mostar. Sadly, not even Bruce Lee could fight off the force of malice. Days after the statue was unveiled, it was vandalized. The sculpture was then moved to a more secure location. It surfaced once again in Zagreb as part of an arts festival. It has now returned to the park in all its splendor, for all to enjoy.",sculptures statues

Local people who knew of the tragedy told the priest of this church, and he took the child from the river and buried the body behind the church. After some 100 or 200 years, the body was exhumed because the Church wanted to build on the grounds. When they saw that the child was well preserved, it was declared a miracle and the body was taken inside the church. Pregnant women and mothers who wish to symbolically protect their children pay homage to the body of the young boy preserved in the old Orthodox church of St. Michael the Archangel, in Sarajevo. The child’s mummified body is positioned on an upper floor tomb on a trestle structure, so that one can pass beneath the child’s body and be blessed by it. To this day, women “who wish to encourage their fertility or to protect their children” walk around the structure three times and then crawl under it.",relics and reliquaries sacred spaces

There are tens of thousands of these inscribed stones scattered around the region, but some of the best-preserved specimens are conveniently located a short walk from the Old City of Sarajevo, at the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Stećci began appearing in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the mid 12th century, reached their peak in the 14th and 15th century, and fell out of use with the arrival of the Ottomans in the 16th century. They were used by followers of the different Christian churches in the region, including the Bosnian Church, Catholics, and Orthodox. While most of the stećci are written in the now-extinct Bosnian Cyrillic alphabet, some inscriptions are written in the Glagolitic alphabet, the first Slavic alphabet created by the same Saint Cyril and Methodius who later created the Cyrillic alphabet. The stećci at the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina are located both outside the main entrance of the museum, and spread around in the botanical garden in the courtyard.  The easiest way to get to the museum is to take the tram number three (3) from the Old City/Baščaršija away from the direction of the Old City. Get off when you see the American Embassy on the right (it's very large and a commonly referenced landmark in Sarajevo) or the Museum itself on the left. You can purchase tickets for around €1 at most kiosks. If you would prefer to walk, which is recommended, go from the Old City to the river and head to the right, following the river along the same street for around 20 to 30 minutes. At some point the street will pull away from the river but will reconnect in about 300 meters and continue until the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina which will be on you right.",tombs medieval

The modest, Ottoman-era building sits at the base of an enormous cliff, where the Buna river seeps out from a mysterious cave and over a small crescent waterfall as it courses towards the larger Neretva. The water flowing by the monastery is a stunning hue of blue and is said to contain mystic properties. The monastery itself was built in 1520 by the Dervish, a mystic branch of Sufi Islam known for rituals that involve various forms of whirling. The monastery was considered a tekija or tekke, a place of spiritual retreat and reflection. Between the beauty of the monastery itself in its impressive setting, the quiet of the nearby village, and the peaceful sounds of rushing water, even the most non-religious visitors can’t help but succumb to its calming influence. Visitors of all faiths and persuasions are welcome to visit and permitted to spend as much time as they like at the monastery. This is not a destination to be checked off a list, but a truly peaceful place to be experienced in full.  Blagaj is easily reached by bus or car from Mostar.

According to this article, there is in Bosnia, near the town of Visoko, a pyramid similar to the Egyptian ones, called by many, “Europe’s first pyramid.” In April 2006 excavations began on the site, led by a Houston-based metalworker, Semir Osmanagić, who claims that the structures were most likely constructed by the Illyrians, and that the pyramid was therefore built between 12,000 and 500 BCE. The “pyramid,” at that moment, became a celebrity, received a name, Pyramid of the Sun, and began to multiply, as it is now talked about as the center of an entire “Valley of Pyramids.” According to Osmanagić, there are four other ancient structures in the valley: the Bosnian Pyramid of the Moon, “Bosanska Piramida Mjeseca;” Bosnian Pyramid of the Dragon, “Bosanska Piramida Zmaja;” Bosnian Pyramid of the Love, “Bosanska Piramida Ljubavi;” and Temple of the Earth, “Hram Zemlje.” Archaeological discovery of the century? The experts say probably not. Where Osmanagić sees all the elements of a ceremonial megastructure–four perfectly shaped slopes pointing toward the cardinal points, a flat top and an entrance complex–professional archeologists see an angular mound and an overactive imagination. Osmanagić’s critics accuse him of promoting pseudo-scientific notions and damaging a legitimate archaeological site–a medieval walled town sits atop the “pyramid”–with his excavations. Throughout all the negativity, Osmanagić remains determined to prove his case.

137,Men's Water of Kladanj,"Pauc, Bosnia and Herzegovina",A wellspring of natural Viagra found in Bosnia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/men-s-water-of-kladanj,"Even at its heyday in the mid 1960s so-called Men’s Water – Muška Voda – of Kladanj was a strange campy attraction. The Balkans, like many other mountainous regions of Europe, have abundance of natural mineral springs. Depending on the particular mineral content, water from many of such springs can have certain health benefits and waters from various locations are recommended as potentially helpful for a wide range of ailments. Enter Men’s Water of Kladanj, a supposed natural Viagra welling forth from the earth. Kladaj is a town in east Bosnia, on the slopes of Konjuh mountain. The legend of the amazing powers of the water from the local spring starts with the famous Ottoman 17th century traveler and writer Evliya Çelebi who described the Kladanj spring as a fountain of youth. In the 1960s a small mountain resort was built near the source and the water was bottled and marketed. Unlike most other brands of mineral water, which were sold in large 1l bottles, this one was sold in half liter square shaped bottles, more akin to hard liquors, probably to emphasize its ‘potency’. As a marketing ploy the water was even sold bundled with folk music records. While scientific research did confirm an overall beneficial effect in regulating blood pressure, blood sugar level and intestinal flora it never confirmed any effectiveness of the water as a cure for impotence. However locals claim that the large number of children in an average family in the region is proof enough of water’s magical properties.  Car is the best option to get to the Muška Voda well. Roads are small and gravel laden, but are currently under construction and are expected to soon be fully operable. Another option is to go to Kladanj (there are buses between Sarajevo and Tuzla leaving more or less every hour) and ask one of the locals to drive you there. There are persons at the main square in the city that might want to help you.

Its history is as fascinating as the building is beautiful. In fact, in 1898, the mosque became the first mosque in the world to receive electricity. The Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque was completed in the 16th century and features Ottoman architecture. To this day, the mosque remains one of the largest in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its electrical first wasn’t the only interesting episode from the building’s past. During the Siege of Sarajevo (which lasted from April 1992 to February 1996), the Beg’s mosque was an obvious target for air raids that sought to bombard major monuments of art and culture. As such, it sustained significant damaged; however, with donations from the international community, the mosque was rebuilt in 1996. While the exterior retains the Ottoman architecture, Bosnian calligrapher Hazim Numanagić redesigned the interior in 2001. Today the mosque serves as the main congregational mosque of the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but tourists and guests are welcomed.

142,Bullfights of Grmec,"Oštra Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina",Two bulls enter. One leaves a champion—but neither loses its life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bullfights-of-grmec,"Bullfights in Bosnia are an ancient tradition. A symbol of power in the Mediterranean since before the Greeks, bullfighting has been present in many forms, from the bull-jumping rituals of ancient Crete to the well-known and bloody corrida de toros in the Spanish-speaking world. Unlike its Spanish counterpart, the Bosnian bullfight does not involve humans as active participants and does not result in the death of the bulls. These fights are duels between the bulls themselves. Fights happen in an open field, as each bull tries to chase its opponent away from a loosely defined pitch. These fights are an extension of natural fights for dominance that occur between male animals of many species in the wild. Fatalities are almost nonexistent, as animals fight within the limit of their natural instincts: When a bull is losing badly, he’ll back down. Bullfights of this sort are organized in many places in western Bosnia and the neighboring Croatian regions of Lika and the Dalmatian Littoral. Arguably the most famous, however, is the so-called Corrida of Grmeč, or Grmečka Korida in Serbian. Grmeč is a mountain in the extreme west of Bosnia. The name is of recent origin and is a version of a Spanish word. The event itself, however, is of ancient origin. Records show the annual bullfights go back for over 230 years. The bullfights are organized on every first Sunday in August. Before the Balkan wars of the 1990s, the venue of the Grmeč event was on Medjedje Brdo near Sanski Most. But the community of Sanski Most was destroyed by the wars, and the fights have been moved to the village of Oštra Luka, part of a Serbian territory. Bullfights attract thousands of spectators each year, mainly locals and their visiting relatives, but also increasingly curiosity seekers from other places. They are accompanied by a typical country fair, along with barbecues, copious amounts of beer, and folk music. In 2005, the Grmeč event was honored by a postage stamp issued by Republika Srpska (a Serbian entity in Bosnia). Curiously, the Balkan tradition bears a striking resemblance to the Japanese bullfights of Okinawa.",wondrous performances rites and rituals

The bridge, known as Stari Most, Old Bridge, or the Mostar Bridge, gave the city of Mostar its name nearly five centuries ago. Hidden up a flight of stone steps in one of the bridge’s old defensive towers, the Museum of the Old Bridge documents the bridge’s long history. Sometime in the fifteenth century, a wooden bridge was built across the river. But as the town slowly grew in importance and became a crucial trading link between the Adriatic Sea and the interior, a stronger bridge was called for. In 1557, Ottoman Sultan Süleyman I commissioned a stone bridge to be built. Hayreddin, an esteemed Ottoman architect, designed the bridge, which took a total of nine years to complete. The imposing stone bridge, known as Stari Most or “Old Bridge,” is almost 100 feet long and some 13 feet wide. On November 9, 1993, during the Bosnian War, bombs purposefully destroyed the historic bridge, which has long stood as a symbol of the region’s multiculturalism. An international movement to reconstruct the bridge soon began, and on July 23, 2004, the reconstructed “new” Old Bridge was unveiled. The Museum of the Old Bridge, also known as the Old Bridge Museum, tells the bridge’s history.  Filled with informative panels and relics, the museum is laid out over multiple floors. Windows on the top floor offer panoramic views of the city. Knowledgeable guides are available and eager to answer questions about the bridge’s history.

In addition to prehistoric carvings, archaeological remains in the area testify to the presence of Illyrians, Romans, Ottomans, Austro-Hungarians, and Slavs. The buildings in the center of Stolac bear signs of Christian (Orthodox and Catholic), Islamic, and Judaist religious traditions. Čaršija Mosque (Emperor’s Mosque) was built in 1519 under the aegis of Sultan Selim and exemplified the local take on the traditional Ottoman architectural style. Unfortunately, the 1992-1995 war left behind immense human and cultural devastation. According to UNESCO, approximately 75 percent of the entire cultural and archaeological heritage in Bosnia and Herzegovina was lost during this relatively short period of time. During the summer of 1993, Stolac was bombed to the ground, including one of its most important and recognizable structures: the Čaršija Mosque. Reconstruction work on the mosque and compound began in 2001. Using pre-war photographs and piecing together the larger fragments, it took three years for a team of experts to complete their mission. The mosque finally re-opened to the public in 2004. One distinctive feature of the Čaršija Mosque is its façade, which showcases some fine murals. The compound where the mosque is located also includes an old well, a fountain, and a cemetery. A school, a reading room, an inn, and a building accommodating 15 shops are also an integral part of the compound, delimitating segments of its boundaries.

Mostar has no shortage of abandoned, bullet-riddled buildings, but the old bank, one of the tallest in the area, is haunted by its especially incendiary role in the Bosnian War.

Besides a sea of torn ledgers and invoices on the third floor, little remains of the bank itself. The roof is still accessible from a ladder on the 10th floor. It offers an exclusive view of Mostar and the surrounding hills. Those who don’t want to enter can enjoy the graffiti around the base of the tower.  Entry is not encouraged by the city of Mostar, but if you are planning to enter, you can hop in around the back.

147,War Hostel Sarajevo,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This unusual hostel provides a glimpse of life in a city under siege.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/war-hostel-sarajevo,"The siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War lasted for almost four years. This made it the longest siege in modern warfare, surpassing well-known historical events such as the sieges of Stalingrad and Leningrad. The population of Sarajevo suffered terribly under the blockade by the Bosnian Serb forces. Food supplies and medicine ran low as water, electricity, and heat were disconnected. The city was constantly bombarded; an average of 329 shells were fired into Sarajevo every day, with a maximum of 3,777 on July 22, 1993. The owner of the War Hostel in Sarajevo, who goes by Zero One, lived through the war, and now operates a unique hostel that recreates the experience for its guests. Normal hostel bunk beds have been replaced with mattresses on the floor lined with military sheets. Lighting inside comes from makeshift wartime lightbulbs powered by a car battery. The walls are covered with bullet holes, and the sound of machine-gun fire and exploding shells can be heard throughout. The owner stresses that this is a place to visit specifically for educational purposes, for those who want a better understanding of life for the people of Sarajevo during the war. Visitors who are looking for a comfortable place to stay are encouraged to find another hostel.",war hotels war history military
148,Buzludzha Monument,"Kazanlak, Bulgaria",An abandoned saucer-shaped monument in the Bulgarian mountains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buzludzha-monument,"On the remote Buzludzha peak in the mountains of Bulgaria stands an unusual abandoned monument. The peak itself was the site of a battle between the Bulgarians and the Turks in 1868. In 1891 a group of socialists lead by Dimitar Blagoev met on the peak to plan for Bulgaria’s socialist future. To celebrate these events, the government in power during the height of Soviet influence decided to erect a monument commemorating socialist communism. Work on the monument began in 1974, and was undertaken by units of the Bulgarian Army assisted by numerous artisans responsible for the large statues and murals. Large images of Lenin and Marx looked over the arena built for state functions and celebrations. Above it all blazed a red star-shaped window in honor of Soviet Russia. After the government’s fall from power in 1989, the site was abandoned and left open to vandalism. The main entrance has been sealed and therefore closed to public. However, there is still a little way to get into the building on the right hand side of the building. Inside the Buzludzha Monument, most of the artwork has been removed or destroyed, but the concrete structure still stands against the elements. A preservation team worked to get the monument listed as one of the seven most endangered heritage sites in Europe, and plans to preserve and restore the monuments are underway. A guard has been put in place 24/7, so it is no longer possible to break inside. Visitors are still encouraged to visit the outside to experience the unique architecture.

149,Devil's Bridge,"Ardino, Bulgaria","An architectural marvel that spans the Arda River, and has stories of a haunted past.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devils-bridge-ardino,"Constructed between 1515 and 1518 in the early 16th century by a builder Dimitar from the nearby village of Nedelino, Dyavolski most, the Devil’s Bridge or also known in Turkish as “Sheytan Kyupriya”, is the most stunning of the humpbacked bridges that cross the Arda River in Bulgaria. It was built over a demolished Roman bridge and cuts from the steep slopes of the Rhodope Moutains along an ancient road linking the Aegean Sea and the Northern Thracian Valley (Gornotrakiiskata Nizina). The bridge is located near the town of Ardino, which even has a water fountain shaped like the bridge. It’s one of several “devil’s bridges” found around Europe. Its span is 185 feet long, 11.5 feet wide, and at its gravity-defying central arch stands 37.7 feet high. Interior semi-circular arches were built in to monitor the water level. The reason some locals are hesitant to cross at night is rooted in dark lore. One story is that the head builder’s wife passed away during construction, so her shadow was encased in the structure. Another tale has it that the devil’s footprint can be found somewhere on the rocks. While this is all folkloric myth, its towering form does make for a somewhat unsettling vista in the darkness. The bridge was declared a cultural monument in 1984. It was also the spot for filming several scenes from the 1988 Bulgarian movie “Time of Violence” (“Vreme Razdelno”).",devils bridge ghosts bridges architectural oddities architecture

The Belogradchik rocks form a 3 km wide and 30 kilometer long strip, and the rock formations reach some 200 meters in height. They were formed at the bottom of a sea as the product of compression (they began 230 million years ago as sediment at the bottom of a shallow sea) and then erosion over the last 45 million years. The rocks, made largely of limestone, also hold hundreds of caves, including Magura Cave where the bones of prehistoric species like cave bear or cave hyena have been discovered, as have cave paintings dating from 10,000 BC - 600 BC. Among two of the most famous and most curious legends surrounding the rocks are that of the Madonna and the Schoolgirl. In the legend of the Madonna, a beautiful nun falls in love with a man on a white horse, gets pregnant, is cast out by the monks and as she is leaving the nunnery, day turns to night and all, Madonna, monks, man on the white horse are turned to stone forming the rocks. The schoolgirl’s legend is remarkably similar. It also concerns a beautiful girl (who seem to be especially prone to being turned to stone) , replace the nuns with a mean schoolmaster, her love interest is a blacksmith, and this time she is being chased by the schoolmaster and runs into a bear, when—kazam!—as before all are turned to stone.",long now locations geological oddities geology

It is difficult not to invoke these mysterious figureheads while walking the site of the Founders of the Bulgarian State Monument in north-eastern Bulgaria. Since 1981, perched on the heights of the town of Shumen, this huge monument commemorates more than 1300 years of Bulgarian history. Visible from as far as 18 miles away, it looms almost 1,500 ft. above sea level, a gloomy overlord hovering over the city of Shumen. Krum Damyanov and Ivan Slavov built the cubist-style memorial in 1981, commemorating the 1300 anniversary of the Bulgarian Empire. The sculptors of the monument, which is also referred to as The Monument to 1300 Years of Bulgaria, gave kings and heroes the appearance of towering giants of stone, echoes of the past forever frozen in concrete. The menacing figures lurk in high corners of a geometric building with slick, towering walls, the monument reached by climbing a stern concrete staircase. Unlike the Buzludzha Monument and many other Bulgarian monuments from the communist era, the Shumen memorial has been kept up over the years, beautifully maintained and a favorite spot for weddings and photo shoots.",communist monuments communist architecture brutalism memorials monuments statues
152,The Eyes of God,"Karlukovo, Bulgaria",The ceiling of Prohodna Cave in northern Bulgaria affords a peek at the sky via two deity-sized-eye-shaped holes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-eyes-of-god-karlukovo-bulgaria,"Located in the Iskar Gorge amidst one of Bulgaria’s largest karst regions, Prohodna is one of the best-known caves in a country full of them. This is thanks in large part to the eerily symmetrical holes in the cave’s ceiling, which provide visitors with a rather striking subterranean image. Known as the Eyes of God, these holes are located in the middle chamber of the 262-meter-long cave, illuminating the interior and providing a uniquely framed view of the firmament above. Remarkably in size, similar in shape, and eyeish in appearance, these holes are the result of natural erosive forces. (The possibility of human embellishment has not been ruled out). These slow and steady forces are still at work, as is often demonstrated by the water running down the cave walls from the “crying” eyes above. Prohodna itself has two entrances opposite each other — the “Small Entrance”, which is 35 meters high, and the “Big Entrance”, which is 45 meters high — making it the largest cave passage in Bulgaria (its name, in fact, means “Thoroughfare Cave” or “Passage Cave”). The pools of light permitted by the ceiling holes can sometimes be visible from either entrance, creating the appearance of glowing eyes staring out from the dark depths of the cave. Little surprise, then, that they are known locally as both the Eyes of God and the Eyes of the Devil. These unique formations provided the backdrop for a scene in the 1988 Bulgarian movie Time of Violence. Prohodna shows evidence of prehistoric habitation, though whether it was a domestic or ritual site is unclear. Today, the Big Entrance of Prohodna is a popular location for bungee jumping.  There is a parking lot near the small entrance, and a path from the nearby Peter Tranteev National Speleological Society leads to the big entrance.",prehistoric rock formations caves ecosystems
153,Rila Monastery,"Rilski manastir, Bulgaria",This historic black and white monastery is one of Bulgaria's architectural jewels.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rila-monastery-2,"Fortress-like, Rila Monastery has gone through many iterations to become the jeweled complex in the mountains that it is today. 1,147 meters (3,763 feet) up in the Rila Mountains, the first and largest monastery in Bulgaria has a history as complex as the region itself. Rila Monastery was founded in honor of the ascetic St. Ivan of Rila (also know as St John of Rila) in the 10th century. He spent the last 20 years of his life praying in relative solitude at a cave some four kilometers away. St. Ivan was revered as a saint during his lifetime. Believers flocked to the remote cave to receive his blessing. Today visitors and pilgrims can still hike from the monastery to visit the saint’s cave — really just a small nook in the mountainside. St. Ivan’s students built the first version of the monastery nearby, and it flourished under the patronage of Bulgarian rulers. However in the 14th century, the Ottoman’s arrival disrupted the peaceful life of the monks. They raided, looted, and destroyed Rila Monastery. In spite of these fallbacks, followers of the church rebuilt it in the late 15th century with help from the Russian Orthodox church and high ranking officials. Even the Sultana, Mara Branković, transferred the remains of St. Ivan of Rila from Sofia to Rila. The monastery prospered again. But in 1833 fire ravished the complex and left only Hreliov’s Tower standing near the Rilska River. Stubbornly, Rila once again emerged from the ashes under the direction of Peter Ivanovich. He envisioned a structure true to the Slavic identity in the face of centuries of Ottoman occupation. Ivanovich built a main church, “Nativity of the Virgin,” in the quadrangle courtyard. Covering it are bright tempera frescoes by Bulgarian masters portraying religious icons, and scenes from heaven and hell. Surrounding Hreliov’s Tower and the church is almost 9,000 square feet of the complex. There is a museum, over 300 monk cells, a library filled with rare manuscripts, and four chapels. The domes, black and white arches, and bright swaths of medieval-style paintings earned it a reputation as a masterpiece of Bulgarian National Revival architecture. Rila Monastery is regarded as a symbol of Bulgaria; it even has a place on their currency. In 1983 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. Rila Monastery continues to draw thousands of visitors despite its remote location. Monks still live there and welcome visitors. Occasionally they can be spotted in their black cloaks and hats walking across the courtyard, sometimes with a cat following. Visitors who want an extended stay on-location can do so in the living quarters and get a small glimpse into the monk life.

154,Historic Melnik,"Melnik, Bulgaria",This tiny Bulgarian town offers a stunning location in the mountains and a storied history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/melnik,"You can see a lot in Melnik (Мелник). Sweeping mountain vistas, quaint city streets and picturesque valleys are all plentiful, as are fantastic markets and great bottles of wine. But the most interesting thing you might come across is this number: 385. That’s the number of residents in this tiny Bulgarian hamlet, and many would say they’re 385 of the luckiest people on Earth. Melnik is the smallest city in Bulgaria by a wide margin – in fact, it’s only able to maintain its status as an incorporated city in somewhat honorary fashion, due to the city’s storied history. In fact, nearly 100 of its barely-more-than-that buildings are designated historic landmarks. Founded more than 1,000 years ago in the 9th century, Melnik has changed hands numerous times as war swept Europe over the centuries, at different times belonging to the Bulgarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Russia, and then Bulgaria once more. The remote city is nestled in the Pirin Mountains, making both travel and residency difficult for citizens. The locals swear by this quiet and reserved isolation however, and visitors are quick to note the quaintness of the town, with its small cafes and old-world atmosphere instantly transporting tourists to something of a land that time forgot. It’s no wonder then, that Melnik has developed a robust and celebrated winemaking tradition, that most ancient of crafts, and one which is perfectly suited for its agrarian surroundings. Of course, that wine is the main cash crop of the sleepy town and brings delight to the locals as well as visitors. Sir Winston Churchill reportedly ordered 500 liters of Bulgaria’s Melnik wine every year leading up to and through World War II. Melnik is also famous for the medieval Rozhen Monastery (Роженски Манастир). The monastery is a ten-minute drive or a pleasant hike from Melnik. There are well-preserved frescoes, stained glass windows, unique carvings, and buildings from the many different historical periods in the life of the monastery. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the many monasteries it founded are still revered, if now little used by either monks or worshippers. That reverence is devotional, of course, for some, but throughout Bulgaria the monasteries remain compelling because of their crucial role in preserving and spreading Bulgarian literacy, culture and identity during five centuries of Ottoman rule. The town is an architectural park and all newly built houses must comply with the Bulgarian Revival architecture. The most visited house is the Kordopulov House, a private museum. Beneath it the ruins of the family church St. Barbara are also worth a stop. Of all once over 70 churches in town, only 3 are still functioning. One of the most important ones is the church St. Antony, the only one dedicated to this saint in Bulgaria. It’s believed that mentally ill patients can cure themselves by spending several nights under the church’s roof. Unlike most Bulgarian orthodox churches, the walls in this one are covered not in biblical scenes, but in more tranquil paintings of flowers and plants. If visiting Melnik on a sunny day and you’re up for a little hike, don’t miss to go all the way up to St. Nicholas plateau. You’ll find the magnificent ruins of several churches, monasteries and Despot Slav’s fortress walls. The views to the magical Melnik Pyramids are breathtaking from there. Melnik is about a 2-1/2 hour drive due south of Sofia. There is a regular afternoon bus from Sofia to Melnik passing through Sandanski. It leaves from the Sofia bus station (just across from the Sofia main train station) and takes about four hours.",cultures and civilizations places to stay eccentric homes shops homes natural wonders nature ruins architectural oddities architecture
155,Monument to the Soviet Army,"Sofia, Bulgaria",A Bulgarian monument to Russia's role in World War II is constantly being painted in pop culture protest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-the-soviet-army,"Built in 1954 to honor the Soviet soldiers who died in Bulgarian efforts during World War II, the Monument to the Soviet Army in Sofia has become a popular site for protest and vandalism involving turning its figures into pop culture icons. Although the huge monument is meant to be a stirring salute to Russian military forces who aided Bulgaria during World War II, the statues and their surrounding park have become a popular hangout for young people and counter-culture radicals. In addition to a tall central spire that sees a Russian soldier holding his triumphant weapon above a group of Bulgarian civilians, there are sculptural reliefs nearer to the ground depicting action-packed scenes of charging soldiers. One such life-size relief has been been redecorated again and again in various acts of protest. In 2011 the charging military figures were painted to look like a mish-mash of American pop-culture icons such as Superman, Ronald McDonald, Santa Claus, and Wonder Woman. The slogan, “In Pace With Time” was scrawled beneath the figures. While this initial act may have been more prankish than political it started a trend that continues today. The figures have been covered in pink in honour of the anniversary of the Prague Spring in 1968, covered in balaclavas to look like the group Pussy Riot, and most recently painted the colors of the Ukrainian flag. Each time the statues are vandalized, they are promptly cleaned but not before the crowds of young people are able to spread images of the painting to the world. The continued vandalism of the Monument to the Soviet Army has managed to raise the ire of not only the Bulgarian government, but Russian officials as well. Yet despite the outrage its highly likely that the bronze soldiers will not remain unmarked for very long. Even without the painted figures, the Monument is an unwitting participant to contemporary life that ignores its history and symbolism. Directly opposite, just steps away, is a huge half-pipe ramp where skateboarders and in-line skaters practice tricks, while those waiting their turn lounge or climb on the Monument steps. Various quarter-pipe ramps are positioned in the walkway between the half-pipe ramp and the Monument steps. Small children sit on the same steps having mid-afternoon snacks or practice their climbing skills. Teenagers looking for love, or its equivalent, climb higher up for a bit of (relatively) alone time. The Monument to the Soviet Army is not quite a case of beating swords into plowshares, but it’s pretty darn close.   Any bus or trolley (in Bulgaria that's the street car with the arms connected to electrical lines) that stops at Орлов Мост (Orlov Most/Eagle Bridge).

156,Museum of Socialist Art,"Sofia, Bulgaria",A collection of art from Bulgaria's time as a communist state.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-socialist-art,"The nondescript, office park-looking building which houses the Museum of Socialist Art perfectly fits the subject matter of its collection. The building is drab, utilitarian, and situated in a shabby neighborhood. But these surroundings only add to the atmosphere of the museum, which exhibits art from Bulgaria’s time as a communist state, from 1946 to 1989. The museum’s collection features works of socialist painting, sculpture, and propaganda, many from eminent artists of the day. Subjects include native communist leaders such as Bulgaria’s first communist leader Georgy Dimitrov and its long-ruling dictator Todor Zhivkov, as well as international communist figures like Vladimir Lenin. Of course, smiling Bulgarian peasants and sweating steelworkers laboring for the state also make an appearance. The museum shop has a small theater which shows propaganda movies and television reels, with English subtitles. The museum, which opened in 2011 and is a branch of the Bulgarian National Gallery, is somewhat small, but the exhibits are interesting. Undoubtedly the premier attraction is the collection of communist statuary arranged outside the museum in the front courtyard, culled from former communist buildings, cellars, and warehouses and saved from being melted down or destroyed, the fate that many such works met at the ousting of Zhivkov in 1989. Huge busts of Lenin glare lifelessly ahead and Bulgarian workers clutch rifles in stone-faced silence, ready to meet the evil forces of capitalism. It even has the gigantic red star which used to sit atop the Communist Party House in Sofia, now an administrative building for the Bulgarian National Assembly.

Located in the Western Rhodopes of Bulgaria, Devil’s Throat Cave is a popular attraction for tourists, spelunkers, and photographers as a subterranean paradise. Enormous and slightly malevolent, the cave descends straight in the depths of hell, with the waters of the Trigrad River plunging 137 ft. into “The Hall of Thunder”. The second largest cavern in the country, the Hall of Thunder houses a funnel through which the water escapes, flowing 500 more feet before joining itself with an underground river. It is this this underground river that presents the most interesting feature of the cave—nothing carried into the Devil’s Mouth Cave by the river ever surfaces from it on the other side. The curious have experimented with everything from pieces of wood to dyes, attempting to track the items (or colors as they make their way through the cave. Despite the fairly short distance, the fact that water seems to take more than 1 1/2 hours to make the journey form one end to the other supports the likelihood of underground streams beneath the river, a possible entirely different geological fascination. Visiting the cave requires a accompaniment by a tour guide, who will lead you through manmade galleries and staircases that lead up along the waterfall. Along the walls are carvings of men and demons, and leading you up and out of the natural entrance into the impressive flora that surrounds the cave’s diabolical mouth.",waterfalls subterranean sites caves ecosystems water
158,The Snail House,"Sofia, Bulgaria",A flamboyant five-story building in Bulgaria resembles a crawling snail.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snail-house-sofia,"The Simeonovo neighborhood in the outskirts of Sofia, Bulgaria isn’t known as a hotspot for many tourists. Yet, hidden in the hinterland, there lives a gigantic snail whose flamboyant rainbow coloration will stop passersby in their tracks. Painted in swirls of red, orange, green, blue, and brown, Bulgaria’s Snail House is five stories tall and is said to have “no straight walls, corners, or edges.” Although it may look like a daycare center or a children’s museum, the Snail House is actually a residential area, the location where many eager spouses have begged their less enthusiastic partners to live inside a multicolored slug. The architect of the Snail House, Simeon Simeonov, has built this rainbow snail abode in anything but a conventional manner. Featuring two tentacles atop its head and curved windows on its side, the snail was ingeniously designed to make all of the building’s appliances appear to be part of its decor. The Snail House’s door, for instance, is painted to be the slug’s mouth, requiring residents to be “swallowed alive” before entering. Simeonov also substituted a standard chimney with a big yellow bee on the snail’s back. In addition to conducting smoke, the bee’s horns double as both night lights and lightning arresters. At the Snail House, even the eyes have a purpose. The house’s air and gas ventilate through the eyelids and exit through the snail’s big red eyes. The radiators at the Snail House are disguised as frogs, ladybugs, and pumpkins. Perhaps the most symbolic feature of this giant escargot, however, is its symbolic meaning for preserving the planet. The Snail House is constructed entirely with lightweight and eco-friendly material, making it truly energy efficient. The next time you pass through the Simeonovo neighborhood, be sure to visit the Snail House, a building so bizarre that you’ll have to drive by at a snail’s pace to get a good look at it.",novelty architecture snails houses homes animals
159,Perperikon,"Gorna krepost, Bulgaria",An ancient Thracian city where fire rituals were practiced on the largest cult altar in Southeast Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/perperikon,"Of all the ancient cultures, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Thracians are some of the most mysterious. Seen by the Greeks as great warriors – as well as barbarians – the Thracians had no written language, and left behind little in the way of monumental architecture. However, this didn’t mean they weren’t good craftsmen, and the Thracians who ruled an area from the Balkans to Bulgaria and Hungary, were expert metal workers making exquisitely crafted jewelry. In Homer’s Illiad he describes a Thracian chariot as “like no war-gear of men but of immortals.” But despite the fact that they were numerous – Herodotus called them the second most peopled group in the world after the Indians – it is believed they mostly lived in villages and were not city builders. (Herodotus also said “they sell their children and let their wives commerce with whatever men they please.”) Today, archeologists still know little about them, and a recent finding has made even the common held beliefs about them suspect. Perperikon (also Perpericon) is the largest megalithic archeological site in the Balkans, and currently being unearthed by Prof. Nikolai Ovcharov, known as the Bulgarian Indiana Jones. It sits on a high, rocky hill some 15 kilometers to the north of the present-day town of Kardzhali in Bulgaria. While the first traces of civilization at Perperikon go back to 5000 B.C. what is of most interest to archeologists is the more recent (1500 B.C.), and only known example, of a huge Thracian city called “the European Machu Picchu” or the “Stone Pompeii.” Complete with buildings, rooms, streets, squares and a water supply system, it is unlike anything that anyone had ever associated with the “barbaric” Thracians. Of particular interest is a huge altar 6 feet in diameter and hewn straight out of the rock. Here the Tracians would have practiced fire rituals such as dancing on hot coals, and would eventually (500 AD) erect a small church when they were Christianized by the Romans. According to the ancient Thracians, the fire dance was in honor of the creator of the world, which was conceived when a woman materialized (showing herself as the sun during the day and asfire at night) and gave birth to a son. The son and mother slept together to make Orpheus the creator/destroyer of the world. The ancient Thracian cult practice of fire dancing continues to this day in the Bulgaria region, under the name Nestinarstvo, though it is now largely commercialized and performed for tourists sake. Despite having been imbued with Christian symbolism, in rural areas of Bulgaria the fire dance is still done in a manner very similar to the way the ancient Thracians would have practiced it on their cult alter in honor of an incestuous creator mother, 1500 years before Christ was born.",ancient cults megalithic cults ruins

The cathedral’s construction began in 1882, but was not completed until 1912, and sanctified until 1924. Named for Russian prince Saint Alexander Nevsky (1221– 1263), the church was built to honor those who sacrificed their lives during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, which liberated Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire.

This scenic, grassy peninsula may appear calm today, but in the past it has seen temples and fortresses, bloody battles, massacres and mass suicide, as well as one of the fiercest naval battles the Black Sea has ever known. Long before the 1791 Battle of Cape Kalikra brought an end to the Russo-Turkish War, Kaliakra was settled by a Thracian tribe known as the Tirizi sometime around the 4th century BC. This stretch of coastline would later be successively occupied by the Romans, the Byzantines, the Bulgarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Romania. There are many stories attached to Cape Kaliakra, some of which are remembered better than others. It is said that King Lysimachus – ruler of Thrace, and heir to Alexander the Great – built his capital here on the cliff. He brought back fine treasures won in campaigns against the Persians, and some say that these remain hidden in caves along the headland to this day. Perhaps the saddest story linked to this peninsula, however, is that of 40 maidens who threw themselves from the cliff to die on the rocks 70m below. In the late 14th century Bulgaria was invaded by the Ottoman Empire and countless people were massacred. To avoid being raped by the Turkish soldiers – or sent back to serve in the Sultan’s harem at Constantinople – the girls tied their hair together and jumped from the tip of Cape Kaliakra.",cultures and civilizations castles ruins architectural oddities architecture

However, when the communist regime collapsed in 1989, the project was abandoned, leaving the synagogue roofless and exposed to the elements. Restoration efforts have been talked for years, but nothing has been attempted yet, and it still remains an empty shell. Update as of August 2022: The synagogue is now under restoration.

The synagogue is located near Baba Vida Fortress, which is on the bank of the Danube River. There is a park along the Danube riverbank, and if you walk through it with the river on your right, you will eventually see the synagogue to your left, right before you reach Baba Vida. It is abandoned and thus open to whoever want to go inside. There is a fence around it and many overgrown plants, but the short part of the fence has a part that is completely cut away, and it is quite easy to find. It is recommended that you only go inside during the day time and wear closed-toed shoes because is broken glass inside. The stairs to the second floor still seem to be structurally sound, so you can climb up there if you want. There will probably be young people hanging out inside the building, so don't be afraid if you hear people inside during the day.",synagogues temples world war ii abandoned military

Though their colors are bright and inviting, the subjects they portray are rather dark and foreboding. The first monastery building in this area was established in medieval times and gained autonomy in the 14th century. Over the years, it was attacked many times by Ottoman conquerors until it was completely destroyed and later abandoned. The current monastery was reestablished in 1825. Over the next decades, a new monastery church was built and adorned with gorgeous paintings created by Zahari Zograf. Admire the artwork, and you’ll see intriguing scenes like the Wheel of Life and images of the Devil attacking and torturing sinners. The 19th-century complex has stood strong in this place despite years of difficulties, particularly in the years when the Soviet-minded government did not look favorably on the religion. Natural forces strained the monastery, too. In 1991, a huge boulder fell from the cliff and caused some damage. The rocky ground where the monastery stands has also been strengthened with huge bolts to hopefully prevent the building from falling down after a possible landslide.  The monastery is located about four miles (seven kilometers) north of Veliko Tarnovo. It is best visited with your own transport. The monastery is not opened all the time.

The spotlights illuminated the massive 11,000 monument so that its majesty could be visible from the sea. In the typical bombastic style of communist-era Bulgaria. The Monument of the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship, or more simply referred to as “The Russian Monument” was constructed in honor of the Soviet Army, as a symbol of friendship between the two peoples. The monument was built on Turna hill, a place that had seen its share of bloodshed as a battlefield where many men had died fighting capitalism and fascism. Like many of the communist-era structures, the friendship monument is glorious and sharply terrifying all at once. 305 stairs that stretch 49 ft. across make up the “Staircase of Victors” that leads to the platform where 4 36-ft. tall concrete soldiers with empty eyes stand at attention, and a cracked bronze cube once held a now extinguished eternal flame. Bronze lettering along the walls of the monument tell the history of the Bulgarian and Russian people, and how their connections have developed over centuries. It took 7 months to construct the token of good will, and over 27,000 volunteers. 10,000 tons of concrete and 1,000 tons of armature iron were carted up the hillside, which was gifted 20,000 newly planted trees to accent the tribute. It was functional and cared for until 1989, and just like so many others of its ilk, it has fallen into disrepair, stripped of its bronze, flame out, music now quiet.

A vaulted brickwork “beehive,” the tomb is part of a larger Thracian necropolis consisting of a corridor and burial chamber decorated with murals that have since been protected as a World Heritage Site. The murals that decorate the necropolis are of exceptional interest because of their elaborate depictions of a ritual funeral feast, fanciful horses, and traditional gestures of farewell. Near the ancient Thracian capital of Seuthopolis, these paintings are one of Bulgaria’s best preserved artifacts from the Hellenistic period. It is estimated that the tomb was built during the last decades of the 4th century BCE. Atop a rocky hill, it has three chambers required by the Thracian cult of the dead: an antechamber for the chariot, horses, or slaves which accompanied the dead to the afterlife; a corridor which stored things needed in the afterlife; and a burial chamber for the body itself.",catacombs unesco catacombs and crypts ruins architectural oddities architecture

Nope. Wrong. Sorry. The correct answer is “Bulgaria.” Plovdiv, Bulgaria is one of Europe’s oldest continuously inhabited cities. Nestled on the Maritsa River, in a valley between the Balkan and Rhodope mountain ranges, the Neolithic settlement became an important Thracian population center, and then the Roman provincial hub known as Philippopolis. Due to its economic and cultural significance, Philippopolis enjoyed the benefit of Roman construction and development, including this theater built in the saddle between two hills overlooking the ancient city. Originally built to accommodate an audience of 5,000-7,000, the subsequent centuries of history (Byzantine, Ottoman, “Eastern Rumilia,” Eastern Bloc) figuratively and literally buried this classical structure, until it was rediscovered thanks to a landslide in 1970. Originally built under the reign of Emperor Trajan, the theater in Plovdiv still bears many striking details, including municipal district names carved into benches so that citizens would know where to sit, engravings that indicate the building was used as a seat for the provincial assembly of Thracia, protective structures that suggest gladiatorial fights against animals were held in the theater, and several walls and steles inscribed in Byzantine Greek (indicating an official policy of Hellenization — rather that Romanization — of the province). The rediscovery and subsequent restoration of the theater is considered one of the crowning achievements of Bulgarian historical conservation. Today, the theater is open to the public, who are afforded unfettered access to not only the seating area but also the stage and backstage dressing area. During the summer, the theater still hosts plays and musical performances. It has also served as the site for modern Zumba parties, and the awards ceremony for the 21st International Olympiad in Informatics (an international computer programming competition for high school students).",theaters roman ancient

If you do the same to a rock, it becomes one of the more unique and whimsical rock formations you’ll ever see. Of course, it takes hundreds of years of erosion for that process to be complete, but the results are fairly typical: mushrooms. Gigantic, freestanding pillars in the distinct shape of mushrooms. Commonly called table rocks in the West, formations like the aptly named Turnip Rock in Michigan or Jug Rock in Indiana bear a distinct resemblance to mushrooms. But the stone mushrooms in Beli Plast, Bulgaria are unique, and the reason is simple: mushrooms. Plural. As in, entire clumps of massive stone pillars grouped together just like mushrooms in the wild. They are formed just the way table rocks are formed: eroded into shape over years and years, as the water that once nearly submerged them lapped against their walls. And then eroded some more by the wind long after the water had receded for good. Unlike most table rocks, the formation at Beli Plast is no single monolith sticking out like a literal sore thumb. These pillars that used to form a lake bed are cute, quaint and suspiciously close in shape and color to actual mushrooms, several of them together yet independent and each reaching several meters high and weighing hundreds of pounds. Under the surface of any number of lakes and rivers, this is how many boulders, rocks and shorelines appear. But it’s rare that you find them, still in tact, in a desert area where water no longer collects.

Flitting in and out between curtains of leaves are the shimmering golden onion domes and Russian Orthodox crosses—tell-tale giveaways of the church’s Russian architecture; it is also known as the Russian Church in Shipka and the Memorial Temple of the Birth of Christ, and as part of the larger Shipka Monastery. The church, which is now Bulgarian Orthodox, was built between 1885 and 1902 in the 17th century Muscovite style, complete with friezes, arcs, and pediments. The building is dedicated to those soldiers—Russian, Ukrainian, and Bulgarian—who lost their lives fighting to free Bulgaria in the Russo-Turkish War from 1877-78 and more specifically, the Battles of Shipka Pass fought between the Russian and Ottoman Empire. The Church officially opened on the 25th anniversary of these battles, with the names of fallen soldiers inscribed on walls within and their remains held in stone sarcophagi in the church’s crypt. The church has a bell tower rising 174 feet, with bells cast from battle cartridges weighing up to 12 tons. The church’s exterior is stunning, especially experienced in its remote and isolated mountain setting, while the interior is decorated with gilded ornamentation and intricate paintings. Shipka Memorial Church is a perfect destination after a long meander up and around the trails in Shipka Pass, where many soldiers sacrificed their lives.

Part of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), one of the most incredible moments was when 7,500 Russian and Bulgarian soldiers stood their ground against nearly 40,000 Ottoman troops. The total of four battles are collectively known as the Battle of Shipka Pass. The pass runs between the towns of Gabrovo and Kazanlak, abuts Stara Planina Mountain, and is part of the Bulgarka Nature Park. Towards the top, at an elevation of around 1,190 m (3,904 ft) you’ll find the town of Shipka, and the hidden gem of the Shipka Memorial Church. Nearby, you’ll also come upon the Shipka Memorial, a 98-foot stone tower commemorating those who died during the many battles in the pass. Within the first floor of the tower is a marble sarcophagus with the remains of Russian and Bulgarian soldiers, while the other seven floors hold historic war relics, the top floor offering a panorama of the peak, the old battlefields—Shipka, Sheinovo and Stara Zagora—and the surrounding scenery. The memorial is one of 26 monuments in National Park Museum Shipka atop Shipka peak, where you’ll also find battle mementos such as dugouts and cannons. A bronze lion guards the memorial entrance that leads to 890 stone steps. Serbia, Montenegro and Romania, the Bulgarian Opalchentsi and the Finnish Guard Regiment were all part of the army of the Russian Empire during what was also known as the War of Liberation (for all but Finland). Overwhelmed by Russian Empire troops, the Ottoman army surrendered at the end of the fourth battle. Today, you can experience the pass both on foot and by car.

Among them is the the tomb of King Seuthes III, who ruled the Odrysian Kingdom in the 4th century BC. The burial site was discovered by archeologists in 2004. It’s a fantastic collection of artifacts that represent Thracian funeral rituals. Before King Seuthes III made the tomb his eternal resting place, it was used as a temple. After his funeral, the first two rooms were walled off and the main passageway was set on fire and filled with dirt and stones. The tomb itself is comprised of several spacious chambers. The first room is rectangular, with a double arched ceiling. The second is circular and domed. The third is an extravagant sarcophagus chamber. The skeleton of the king’s sacrificed horse was found in the first room. One of the most fascinating features is the detailed bust of what is believed to be the king. Archaeologists also found a plethora of artifacts like knee pads, leather armor, weaponry, tack for the king’s horses, ceramic vessels filled with wine, a ritual bed, and a carpet made from gold thread. It makes sense that the king would have such a lavish burial site. Seuthes was a powerful leader. After gaining control over the Odrysian Kingdom, he relocated it to Thrace.

The two most commonly attributed are Sofia and Athena, both of Hellenistic origins.

Lyudmila Zhivkova, daughter of former communist leader of Bulgaria Todor Zhivkov, had the idea for a national exhibition space. Lyudmila worked for her father’s communist government and had an influential role in the promotion of Bulgarian arts and culture. Works on the project were completed in 1981, which coincided with Bulgaria’s 1300th anniversary. Alexander Barov, a Bulgarian architect, was the lead designer on the Palace. The Palace has an official symbol: a bronze sun representative of the old ceilings in traditional houses. The venue spans a whopping 15,000 square meters of concert venues, conference halls, gallery space, theaters and cinemas. Dozens of sculptures, paintings and wood carvings decorate the inside of the building’s many rooms. Each year, the Palace puts on a huge New Years event, which started in 1984. Some of the most famed contemporary artists have performed their work at the Palace including Andrea Bocelli, the opera singer, violinist Nigel Kennedy and soprano Darina Takova.

It’s also surrounded by little mysteries—crumbling buildings, tumbling boulders, unsettling crypts, worn gravestones, foreboding artwork, and at least two tunnels. One of those mystery tunnels is located a few hundred meters downhill, on the winding road leading up to the monastery. The tunnel entrance is only visible to passersby in winter, when the leaves have fallen from the trees that mask its presence. The unassuming steel door, concrete arch above it, and the regularity of construction indicate that this is a relatively modern tunnel, but none of the locals seem to be able to tell when or why it was built. Most likely it was constructed during the Cold War. Park across the road (on the right if you’re going uphill), make your way through the underbrush to the entrance, pull open the great, green metal door, and the tunnel stretches away into the darkness. Assuming you have a torch, it’s safe enough to venture all the way in until you meet the pile of rubble that blocks the tunnel, about 60 or 80 meters from the doorway. Until that point, the tunnel is solidly built and arrow straight. Where it leads to next is hard to guess. As you explore the tunnel, which has no side branches, notice the lack of graffiti, vandalism or damage (aside from the collapsed roof that blocks further exploration). It’s dry, quiet and peaceful; signs of a space that’s long gone unperturbed. The only signs of previous human presence you may see are patches where small fires have been lit in the middle of the floor. Pages torn from what looks to be a collection of mechanical manuals fueled these fires. Their age indicates nothing in particular about the origins of the tunnel, as aged books are commonplace throughout Bulgaria.  Take caution if you decide to enter the tunnel.

There were no climbing harnesses, and the first climbing carabiner was a thousand years away. It is important to keep these facts in mind when thinking about the Madara Rider, a stone relief in Bulgaria from around 710 CE. The Madara Rider is a stone carving, not unlike many found around the world on the sides of cliffs or inside of caves. The Rider depicts a horse-backed warrior victorious over a lion, celebrating his kill with an eagle, and a dog at the horse’s hooves. In itself, the Rider is not a spectacular artistic effort. However, the Rider was created 1,300 years ago, seventy five feet off of the ground on a nearly vertical rock cliff, which reaches more than two hundred and fifty feet above the relief. Inscriptions on the rock around the work mark events between 700-800 CE, and show a period of Bulgarian history before their conversion to Christianity. In a sense, this adds to the mystery of the relief, as it was a sacred pagan site prior to conversion. You can still make out the grayhound-like dog behind the horse and the lion pierced by a spear in front, but a large vertical crack and centuries of moisture and wind have effaced much of the detail the carving must have originally offered. The inscriptions too have significant portions that are unintelligible. Both sculpture and inscriptions, carved in triumphant recognition of a Bulgarian state ascendant, were forgotten during the five centuries of Ottoman rule. Aside from its date and the inscriptions in the area, little else is known of the Madara Rider, making the means of its creation all the more mysterious. The Rider has been granted UNESCO World Heritage status based on the wonder of its creation. Along with global recognition, it gives a great deal of pleasure to Bulgarians. The Rider was minted on a number of Bulgarian coins around the year 2,000 and it has become a symbol of national pride. The Madara archeological preserve contains far more than the Madara Horseman itself. It has beautiful walkways, large and small caves, and evidence of settlement from ancient times.

Just minutes from popular beaches on the Black Sea coast, near the city of Primorsko, is an isolated patch of forest where one can wander around the abandoned, never-finished grand residence Zhivkov had planned, known as Perla 2 (perla means “pearl”). (Not to be confused with Perla 1, another abandoned Zhivkov residence nearby.) The massive building today consists of a skeletal frame of raw reinforced concrete and arches of steel, with multiple wings and countless rooms that provide plenty of fodder for the imagination—just what kind of opulence would have been there, or which room the dictator planned to inhabit. The building also serves as an example of the brutalist architectural style. Unfinished stairways lead to different areas, including ones that go to the flat roof. The terrace has begun to resemble a swamp, with water and even wetland plants, topped with a few trees. And last, for the brave and perhaps foolhardy, are the steps down to the basement. There resides a colony of hundreds, if not thousands, of bats, and who knows what else.  Do not confuse the site with Perla 1, which is on the other side of the beach. It is also an abandoned residence of Todor Zhivkov, but there is a restaurant and beach club in its shadow. Ask and look for Perla 2. Be on guard for the wild and possibly dangerous animals in the forest and the abandoned complex.",communist architecture communism mansions beaches abandoned
184,Rose Museum,"Kazanlak, Bulgaria","Said to be the only museum in the world dedicated to the most classic of all blooms, the rose.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rose-museum,"Part of the larger historical museum in Kazaniak, Bulgaria, the Rose Museum started out as an exhibition temporarily staged to honor the region’s relationship with the oil-producing flower. Eventually, its popularity led to the Rose Museum becoming its own mini-museum, exploring every facet of Bulgaria’s rose production industry. It is the only museum of its kind in the world, and digs into almost every aspect of rose oil and rose water production. Rose-picking/producing has been an important industry in Bulgaria since at least 1650, when written evidence of industrial capacities of the plant were first recorded on paper. Its first export of rose oil was recorded in 1740, sold to a French perfume company as a raw material for the much-desired essential oils that acted as a key player in countless fragrances worn by the women of Europe. Different types of Bulgarian rose oil are produced through a few different extraction methods. The steam distillation process allows for intermediate cooling and produces an oil called attar of roses, while a process of solvent extraction produces rose absolute, and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction produces an essential oil referred to as absolute or as a CO2 extract, which is the type most often used in perfumery. The museum contains the reproductions of the first laboratory for rose oil studies as well as a 1912 rose warehouse. Photos, documents, and vessels for storing and transporting the precious oils are also popular attractions. A gem of the museum that is considered one of its biggest attractions is a vessel that still smells of the musky, floral fragrance despite being out of commission since the 1940’s. The gift shop offers the usual museum fare alongside rose jam, rose liquor, and rose-scented cosmetics. 3km north of centre up ul Osvobozhdenie; take a taxi (3 lv one way), or bus 3 from Kazanlâk’s main square",horticulture flora plants museums and collections museums
185,The Necropolis of St. Sophia Church,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Underneath this Byzantinian church lies a necropolis filled with ancient tombs and the ruins of previous churches.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-necropolis-of-st-sophia-church,"Saint Sofia Church was constructed on the site of several former churches, the earliest of which dates back to the 4th-century. During this time, Sofia was known as the ancient Roman city of Serdica. Over the centuries, a series of subsequent churches were built on the site of the original 4th-century church only to be destroyed by invading forces. Following each wave of destruction, a new church was erected in its place. The current church that exists today is believed to be the fifth iteration of a religious building at this location. The most recent Saint Sofia Church was constructed sometime during the middle of the 6th-century when Bulgaria was under the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. During the 16th-century the church was converted into a mosque to serve the Muslim population under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The former church would remain a mosque for about three centuries. The mosque was abandoned in the 19th-century during Russia’s liberation of Bulgaria and was later re-established as a church. Archaeologists who have excavated the surrounding area discovered that the church stands above the remains of an ancient necropolis. Today, many of the ruinous tombs have been carefully unearthed and are open for the public to explore. This archeological work has helped to reveal the extent of the former Roman city. There are several levels below the church that reflect various eras throughout history, each supported by several informative display panels. The undercroft features mosaics from the floors of the previous churches, as well as some 50 tombs some of which contain traces of frescoes and other ancient artifacts. Sections of each level have been fitted with modern staircases and transparent flooring to reveal and protect the surfaces below.  The entrance to the necropolis can be found inside St. Sofia Church. As you walk inside, head past the small shop area and turn left to access the staircase. There are several staircases, areas of uneven floor, and dim lighting throughout the complex.",tombs ancient archaeology churches sacred spaces

Following the allied bombing of Sofia in WWII, plans were set in motion to create a new center for Bulgarian government. Between 1952 and 1958 the grand Party House (home of the former Bulgarian Communist Party) was built along with the two structures that flank it. Today, these house the Bulgarian National Assembly, the State Council, and the President’s office, as well as some non-administrative establishments like the National Archaeological Museum and a department store. In 1989 most of the communist iconography was removed in the name of progress and new democratic ideology. The red star was removed from the top of the Party House by helicopter and replaced with the Bulgarian flag, and a statue of Sveta Sofia was erected to replace a towering monument to Lenin. Knyaz Aleksandar Dondukov Boulevard and Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard (both named for heroes of Bulgarian liberation) merge together at the Largo. At their intersection there was, until recently,  a lawn known as Nezavisimost, or Independence Square. On it were flags representing each of the NATO member nations. Around 2006, plans were unveiled to remove Nezavisimost Square and replace it with a glass dome, so that the underground ruins of the Ancient Roman city Serdica would be visible to sightseers. This plan met with some controversy from Bulgarians, and construction was stalled for a time. Eventually, the plan was realized, and the glass covering was installed. Today, pedestrians in the Largo can peer down into the space below, which includes the preserved Roman ruins. Likewise, visitors to the ruins can look up through the glass and see the facade of the National Assembly building above. The underground space also has access to some shops and to the city’s metro system.",lenin communist architecture soviet architecture communism government soviet history ruins

It consists of ten cells (caves) located about 98-feet (30-meters) above ground. The cells are separated into two groups. The first consists of three cells followed by two other separate caves. The second group, the main enclosure, is made of five cells, two of which are located higher than the others. The caves of this grouping are connected by small tunnels carved into the rock. In the last cell, visitors will find an empty grave accompanied by a cross carved into the wall. It’s assumed the grave was the victim of robbers since few traces remain of its contents. In the past, the monastery was practically inaccessible. Nowadays, a metallic suspension bridge allows visitors to cross over the valley to reach the second group of caves. The monastery is occasionally home to a couple of rock eagles.  The monastery is accessible by hiking from Provadia or by walking the trail on top of the cliffs from the Ovech Fortress. The bridge is stronger than it looks. It may appear locked from afar, but it's actually open and many people go there. Just squat down to pass a small fence over the bridge, and then again to enter the monastery. The ceiling of the caves is quite low, especially in the tunnels, but you can still walk if you bend down. The last cell with the grave is only accessible through a hole in the ceiling of the fourth cell. Be careful, as there are no railings inside the monastery, and also be respectful of this historic site.",monks monasteries caves ecosystems history & culture

One of  the main attractions for visitors to Pernik is the Starite Rudnitsi 1891 (The old mines 1891). When the coal beds were discovered, Pernik developed quickly, turning into the energy hub of the country. The mine operated until 1966, and in 1986 it was transformed into a massive underground museum dedicated to the history of mining in Pernik. During its heyday, the mine was filled with parakeets to warn miners about gas leaks. Before the days of steam engines, horses were trained specifically to remove coal. They were not bothered by the dark and loud noises while hauling coal. When the mine ran dry, the city’s economic power also faltered.  You can park right in front of the mine, but tickets have to be purchased at the regional history museum of Pernik next door. Tours run every hour officially.

The main waterfall extends to around 65 feet (20 meters) and splits into multiple, smaller waterfalls as it cascades downhill. Multiple paths allow visitors to explore the surrounding area, including a cave that allows access to the source of the waterfall. It’s believed the water in the area contains medicinal properties for joint, skin, and other physical ailments. On Saint George’s Day, locals carry out a ceremony at the waterfall as they attempt to embrace its healing powers. Keen explorers will also discover a small church within a cave in the area that is rumored to be part of a long-gone, much larger Krushuna monastery. The falls are an excellent escape from the city and allows visitors an opportunity to get back to nature.

The Asen family went on to found a powerful dynasty, and ruled Bulgaria for a century. Sofia is the capital of modern day Bulgaria, but the Asen Tsars ruled from Veliko Tarnovo. A monument to the Asen dynasty in the center of the city marked 800 years after the Asen brothers proclaimed Veliko the capital. Ivan and Peter ruled the newly liberated Bulgaria together and undertook battles against Byzantine forces. A system of hereditary rule allowed the family to retain power and the seat of the Tsar was exchanged regularly between family members. As one expects, however, it wasn’t always happy families. Ivan Asen II overthrew his own cousin Boril and then blinded him. Others died in attempts to expand the empire too. The monument Veliko Tarnovo looks down on to the Yantra river and the old town.

But the interior is unlike that of any other Christian building. In the fifth century, the hilltop was already the site of a Roman basilica, and the cathedral was built in the 11th and 12th centuries, during the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire, among other buildings that made the stronghold a center of political and religious activity. But by 1393, troops of the Ottoman sultan conquered the fortress and destroyed the cathedral. Nearly 600 years later, the cathedral was rebuilt on the same spot. At the time, however, the government was communist and officially atheist. The building was completed in 1981 to mark the state’s anniversary, and when it opened to visitors in 1985, it was not for religious services, but for the frescoes and murals painted by Bulgarian artist Teofan Sokerov depicting the history of the Bulgarian state. Despite political changes in the country, Ascension Cathedral still has no altar and remains a museum rather than a church. The frescoes have received mixed reviews. Some view them as impressive examples of social realism that demonstrate different periods of suffering and heroism of the Bulgarian people, while many religious people consider them disrespectful. Others highlight the unusual and modern approach that makes this church an important cultural landmark of Veliko Tarnovo. Irrespective of one’s religious views, the complex provides a good overlook of the town.",murals churches monuments sacred spaces art

It started from scratch in 1947 when thousands of youth gathered at this spot and started a colossal building project to create a new city. The result was a utopian Socialist environment with straight streets, large squares, park areas, and districts that were segregated into different types of factories and workers. The new town was named Dimitrovgrad for the first communist leader of Bulgaria, Georgi Dimitrov. Not much has changed in Dimitrovgrad since it was constructed making it one of the biggest open-air museums of socialist architecture or “Stalin Baroque.” The houses still stand with the same ideological decorations, columns, and small balconies. The most notable advancements are air-conditioners, plastic windows, and commercial billboards. Dimitrovgrad was once a booming location with large factories and open opportunities for young people to start their life. Nowadays, it’s just a sleepy little town. For the 70th anniversary of Dimitrovgrad, the town created a time-capsule of local life as it was when the town was created in this apartment. Visitors can familiarize themselves with furniture, home decorations, technical appliances, and everything else from the 1950s and 1960s. All the items in the apartment are authentic and were mostly donated by local residents.  Visits to the apartment can be arranged via the local history museum.

While other governments caved to the tyrant’s demands, Bulgaria refused to cooperate and 50,000 Bulgarian Jews were rescued from certain death at the hands of the Nazis. Fearing that Germany would pressure Bulgaria to reverse their decision, most of the Bulgarian Jews fled their country. In the town of Gotse Delchev, a small, calm and beautiful town close to the border between Bulgaria and Greece, almost all of the Jewish community followed suit and thousands left Bulgaria. Only one Jewish family did not leave the town in the midst of the war and remained to maintain the town’s temple. The temple sits on one of the town market squares, in between what could best be described as the equivalent of the American “Dollar Store” ventures. Known among the population as “the Havre,” the building was converted into the family’s home after the war. On its exterior, it looks like it always has, featuring a rounded dome topped with the Star of David. However, the interior is a mix of storage and apartments, starkly highlighting the absent Jewish community. The population of the town is now a mixture of Bulgarians, Turks, Roma and other groups, mostly of the Muslim and Eastern Orthodox faith.

The building was constructed around 1926 as the head office for one of the first insurance companies in Bulgaria. It was designed in the Secession style with delicate ornaments that conveyed an elegant beauty. The pinnacle of the building’s design is the corner dome that houses a clock. There is a sculpture of a mother with her two children and a beehive next to her feet. The composition evokes the values of prudence and protection, hard work, and care for the next generation. At the time, it was the highest building in Sofia and arguably the most splendid. Eleven years later, the insurance company commissioned the construction of the “Bulgaria” Complex. This was another building constructed in the same plot, attached to the original building. Although both buildings shared the same owner, they were designed by different architects holding opposite views of aesthetics. Inevitably, both buildings became ideological enemies. The “Bulgaria” Complex was a new design rarely seen before. The building combined a hotel, restaurant, and a concert hall large enough for more than a 1,000 visitors under one roof. It’s a modernist masterpiece devoid of ornamental designs. The beauty of the adjoining building was achieved by regular mathematical proportions and the solemn repetition of elements. A radical decision was later made to strip the old building along the main street of its ornaments. However, along the side street, the original façade was left untouched. Now, half the building shows an ample collection of ornaments while the other side is completely bare. A contrast of the festive and mundane.",buildings design history & culture architecture

Though there seems to be nothing left of it to this day, the strategic nature of the location makes it clear how convenient it would have been for a fortress. The site is located on a rocky peninsula, a flat piece of land spanning about 220 acres and protected from three sides with steep slope that run down to the nearest river. A defensive wall would be needed only from the fourth side to make the area completely inaccessible. In the Roman maps, indeed there is a city on this spot and it is labeled “PALMATIS.” One of the few pieces of evidence for the ancient city are the ruins of a spacious public building, thought to be a basilica. But the walls are completely destroyed and the ground is covered with the debris of limestone fragments. The first impression is of a desolation. After a careful inspection, it becomes clear that these fragments have belonged to old architectural structures which have once held the great roof of the basilica. Those were grandiose columns arranged in two rows, which were dividing the nave in three isles. What is left today are only their bases, which except one are still in the original spots. Everything else is either missing or scattered around, broken. In the eastern side of the ruins lies the most intriguing part, which is also the best preserved. This is the altar area, where the floor stands slightly higher and is clearly outlined by a row of flat stones. Inside are the ruins of the atlar table and the seats for the clergy, which form a structure called a synthronon. The ruins can hint the layout of the floor plan and give a rough impression of the size of the building. But what they cannot do is to tell what it was like to be in the basilica. With only about five percent of the building preserved today, many of the building’s details must be left to the imagination.  The basilica is located just after the last house in the Onogur village.

The cave is impressively large measuring a little over a mile (two kilometers) in length and in places over 100 meters in height. Several large holes in the roof, commonly referred to as eyes, allow daylight to illuminate the vast interior. This offers very interesting photographs, including at night when moonlight streams through the “eyes.” Devetashka Cave was used as a secret military base in the 1950s and subsequently for the storage of petroleum. There is evidence of this in the various concrete bases, walls, and bridges across the river which flows through the cave. More recently, the cave was a scene for the action film The Expendables 2 when Sylvester Stallone crash lands a plane into the cave. Interestingly, the film was later deemed to be in breach of Bulgaria’s environmental regulations, as the bat population was significantly harmed.

As an example of its popularity, the hotel has been featured on a number of online forums and blogs with regards to its distinctive take on brutalist structure. Construction on the hotel began in 1967, but the project was not completed until 1981. Difficult terrain, unplanned changes in materials, and a change in management were among the setbacks that this monumental architectural project faced. The hotel was rather extravagant back in its heyday, housing a swimming pool and riverside nightclub. Unfortunately, it appears that these have been closed and decaying for a number of years now. In 2017, the hotel business went bankrupt and after concerns that the building may be left derelict, a new owner took over. Time will tell over whether the condition of the hotel will be able to return to its glory days. Reviews online give some idea of the current state of the hotel. Despite still welcoming guests, it appears that the building is semi-abandoned. Perhaps this is what makes the hotel stand out though, as it allows visitors to step back in time.

The river flows below worn metal treads of a suspension bridge, which leads to an unnamed lane lined with decaying buildings. Inside a large building, glimpses of art are visible through broken and missing windows—this is the factory’s social hall. One of the most striking pieces is visible even before you arrive inside the main hall: a colorful mural of a farmer who labors in his straw hat as the sun sets behind him. Go inside, look to your right and you’ll see a demented white tiger in a military cap cackling to itself at the end of the hall. These are both modern pieces, but between them, is something special: a 20-meter (65 foot) Communist-era mural featuring drab but doughty workers, an assortment of gorgeous hats, a villain with a monocle, and a terribly grim horse. This is the social hall, its floor strewn in glass shards, dead leaves, unmatched shoes, pages of technical documents shaken loose from binders, reels of 8mm film, endless flakes of paint, and other urban detritus. Many of the rooms connected to the main hall are filled with well-executed art pieces. One is entirely full of chairs. The basement is dark and crowded with crumbling concrete, and is accessible from at least two stairwells. The stairwell closest to the street requires significantly more bravery to traverse than the burned out one at the rear, which is safer and has lovely, peeling teal paint. This relic on the outskirts of Veliko Tarnovo is a fascinating time capsule of Communist Bulgaria, with modernity seeping in through its cracks. The nearby Hostel Mostel has several vinyl records that were rescued from the social hall. They’re filled with alarms and evacuation messages, and were produced for training purposes when the complex was functional.  The roads from the main fortress gate lead to another road, Sveti Kliment Ohridski. Follow it toward the rear of the fortress and you’ll find a rusted suspension bridge over the Yantra River. On the opposite side, across Ulitsa Ksiliforska, there's a bus stop. Walk across the bus turnaround area and turn right up the street, and you’ll see the factory buildings. You can enter the social hall by walking up the stairs and through the main entrance. The next building up the street is an active business which sometimes has a few cars parked out the front, although no one will care that you're paying the hall a visit—just the friendly stray dogs, who like to bounce around the perimeter of your path.",the soviet imprint textiles communism factories graffiti soviet history abandoned
