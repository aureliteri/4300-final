0,Murchison Falls,Uganda,Where the White Nile River dramatically cascades between Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert in Uganda.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/murchison-falls-kabalega-falls,"Also known as Kabalega Falls, Murchison Falls is a spectacular waterfall where the White Nile bursts through a narrow rocky gap and tumultuously tumbles some 140 feet into a pool known as “The Devil’s Cauldron” before flowing into the tranquil Lake Albert. English explorers Samuel and Florence Baker named Murchison Falls named after the president of the Royal Geographical Society, Roderick Murchison. The local name, Kabalega Falls, is a remnant of Ugandan military officer and former president Idi Amin’s regime. In the 1970s, Amin unofficially renamed Murchison Falls to Kabalega Falls in reference to Kabalega of Bunyoro, the late-19th-century king of Bunyoro, Uganda. Murchison Falls crown the magnificent surrounding region, which is subsequently known as Murchison Falls National Park. The park is sited in the Albertine Rift Valley’s picturesque northern end. The park was established as a game reserve in 1926, and today, it serves as the oldest and largest reserve of its kind in the nation. Comprised of the National Park, Bugungu Wildlife Reserve, and the Karuma Falls Wildlife Reserve, the Murchison Falls Conservation Area is home to more than 70 mammal species and 450 species of birds. The riverbanks are dotted with buffalo, hippos, and crocodiles, while elephants, lions, leopards, chimpanzees, and giraffes roam the forests and savannas. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited what is now the National Park in 1907, and notably remarked that the landscape reminded him of a wild Kew Gardens. Other visitors of historical significance include Ernest Hemingway, who supposedly crashed a plane near the falls in 1954,  and former United States President Theodore Roosevelt. The area also makes an appearance in the 1951 film, The African Queen.","Murchison Falls National Park is accessible by car and by plane. The National Park is a popular site for wildlife viewing, hiking, and bird watching. Hot air balloon rides are also offered for an aerial view of the landscape. The park is open year-round, but visits are particularly recommended between January and March, June and late September. Several options for safari are available to prospective visitors."
1,Equator Line Restaurant,"Kayabwe, Uganda","This small roadside eatery exists in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, as the equator runs right through it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/equator-line-restaurant-uganda,"Order a coffee from a barista standing in another hemisphere at this photogenic geographical oddity. A yellow line is painted across a busy village road chock full of motorcycle taxis, thundering buses, and trucks. The line passes through a pair of bright white circular structures, bearing the words “Uganda Equator.” This simple stripe marks the globally significant parallel at 0 degrees latitude. The equator passes through the center of these large, selfie-hotspot hoops on either side of the busy thoroughfare and goes straight through the main entrance of the Equator Line Restaurant. Inside the eatery, the line of the equator crosses the cool tiled floor, passes a bar area, and continues as a yellow painted strip up the wall. Here, in this popular restaurant 6,025 miles from the North and South Poles, the division of Earth’s hemispheres is clearly marked for all to see. The equatorial establishment offers visitors the chance to undertake a series of “water experiments,” one in each hemisphere, and a third directly on the equator itself, after which they are awarded an “equatorial certificate.” In addition to all the the geographical fun to be had, visitors shouldn’t forget that the Equator Line Restaurant is also a place to dine. The eatery serves wonderfully aromatic, freshly ground Ugandan-grown coffee, and the rolex, a favorite Ugandan snack that’s a kind of mixed vegetable omelette wrapped in chapati bread. This local dish is complemented on the menu by a range of food and drink from all over the globe, upon whose principal dividing line the small eatery proudly sits.","The restaurant is in the village of Kayabwe, a little over halfway between the Ugandan capital, Kampala, and the busy city of Masaka. Many tours operating from Kampala or the lakeside resort of Entebbe, bound for the national parks of Bwindi, Queen Elizabeth, and Lake Mburo pass through Kayabwe, and most will stop at the equator line for an unmissable photo opportunity. Public transport is also available from Kampala in the form of regular buses bound for the west of the country and Rwanda."
2,Bwindi Impenetrable Forest,"Kisoro, Uganda",The home of half the world's population of critically endangered mountain gorillas.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bwindi-impenetrable-forest,"It’s tough to describe the feeling of disbelief as you watch a wild gorilla happily devour the plant that, only five minutes prior, burned your skin due to slight contact with its unforgiving leaf. The stinging nettle plant is just one of the reasons for the area’s intimidating name, the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Located in the mountains of Uganda, this dense tangle of trees is home to many species, including about half of the world’s population of endangered mountain gorillas. It’s estimated that fewer than 900 mountain gorillas exist in the world. Catching a glimpse of these rare, beasts in their natural habitat is an awe-inspiring experience. There are several gorilla families that roam freely and peacefully around Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. This is to the credit of organizations like the Mgahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest Conservation Trust (MBIFCT). These organizations hire trained gorilla trackers to spend their days finding and staying with the gorilla families. In this way, the trackers are able to study the gorillas’ behavior, condition them to see humans as a non-threat, and protect them from poachers. Visitors have the opportunity to hike and explore the forest to spend some quality time with these smelly but beautiful creatures. Although the battle with the thick brush can last for several grueling hours, there’s no experience quite like this one. Walking and grunting among the gorillas is well worth the exhausting trek. All the profits from a gorilla trek go into further research and conservation efforts. Not only will you find yourself standing a few feet away from a wild gorilla, but you will witness the beauty that lives within the Ugandan villages surrounding them. And don’t worry, although the stinging nettle will inevitably get you, the forest is also home to the plant that contains the remedy.","Bwindi is the most popular place to trek for gorillas in Uganda. The park is located in the Southwestern part of the country and is one of the most diverse national parks in East Africa. Bwindi is divided into four regions: Buhoma region, Ruhija region, Rushaga region, and Nkuringo region. Gorilla permits are issued within one of these four areas for tourists. Within each region is a family or several that have been habituated to humans. To avoid rain, the best time to visit the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest Reserve is during the ""cold"" season in June through July. It is highly recommended to book your visit with a licensed gorilla trekking tour to ensure safety. The forest reserve is accessible by either airplane or car. For drivers, Bwindi is a two to three-hour drive from Kampala or can be reached via a daily bus service from Kampala to Butogota by way of Rukungiri and Kihiihi. By air, Bwindi is served by three airfields. Travelers can fly in from Kampala or Entebbe."
3,Source of the Nile at Jinja,"Jinja, Uganda","A strangely forgotten claimant to the much contested title of ""Source of the Nile.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/source-of-the-nile-at-jinja,"On August 3, 1858, John Hanning Speke discovered the source of the Nile—in a sense. What remains unquestionable is the fact that this spot became the source of a historic feud between Speke and his expedition-mate, Richard Francis Burton, who were once united in a hellbent quest to pinpoint the same headwaters David Livingstone infamously failed to locate. This small spot along the shoreline in Jinja, Uganda, marks the place where Speke “discovered” the Nile’s headwaters at Lake Victoria while his partner, Burton, convalesced separately at Lake Tanganyika. When the two camps reunited, Burton rejected Speke’s claim in favor of his own idea that Tanganyika was the source of the Nile River. Burton refused to consider the matter anything but “unsettled” until Speke leveraged the British media to lay claim to the validity of his discovery. A vicious public battle ensued between the two men, and continued to spread throughout the contemporary scientific community. It took the Royal Geographic Society stepping in to send Speke back to Lake Victoria to substantiate his theory, which he did in a manner some saw questionable, before the matter of the Nile’s source was declared settled (for a time) in 1863. The rift between the two men, however, would never heal. Speke, now a hero of the Age of Explorers, published two books that made him look a braggart. Burton, meanwhile, refused to accept defeat. A public debate between the two men was scheduled to take place at the British Association to settle matters once and for all, but on the day before the debate, Speke suffered an accidental, fatal rifle shot to the head while hunting. Popular assumption became that Speke’s death was a well-disguised suicide, motivated by a fear of facing Burton in public. The source of all this tumult is marked by a modest sign that reads “The Source of R. Nile - Jinja - World’s Longest River” at Ripon Falls, a series of cataracts that are partially submerged due to dams constructed downriver. A small cafe and shops, as well as boat dock with tours for hire, are located adjacent to this monument.","The site is best accessed via boat, and boat trips to the marker are available. Camping and nature walks are available nearby. It's also a great area for birdwatching."
4,Lake Mburo National Park,"Nyabushozi, Uganda",Uganda's smallest savannah park is home to over 350 species of birds and mammals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-mburo-national-park,"At 260 sq. km, Lake Mburo National Park is the smallest savannah national park in Uganda. The park is nestled among local Banyankole Bahima tribal land. Lake Mburo National Park is teeming with wildlife, with over 350 bird species and large animals like zebra, warthog, giraffe, hippopotamus, impala, buffalo and the elusive eland. The park works closely with the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) on wildlife conservation. This collaboration has focused on the reintroduction of lions, baboons, eland and other wildlife that were destroyed during political unrest in the past decades. Multiple attempts to eliminate tsetse fly infestations as well as poaching activities also resulted in wildlife loss. By working closely with UWA and tribal locals, the park is an example of how wildlife and locals can successfully co-exist. The park offers ranger-guided tours to watering holes for wildlife spotting in the park and birding trips near the lake. Facilities include multiple restaurants close to the lake and tent/accommodation facilities to stay in the park. Expect to go on boat safaris, horseback rides, and guided ranger tours if you stay in the park. This park is a birding paradise so take your binoculars and camera for a unique Ugandan experience.","The park restaurant near the lake has simple Ugandan food next to spectacular lake views and is highly recommended for the price, quality of food, and view. An alternate hotel/resort to stay would be at the Igongo Cultural Centre, which is a 45-60 minute drive away. Be aware of vervet monkeys near the park ranger station who are wily enough to enter any open vehicle in search of a quick snack."
5,Aero Beach,"Entebbe, Uganda",An aeronautical-themed resort forged around rusty relics from the golden age of air travel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aero-beach,"Leaning into the soft lakeside soil, or sandwiched between buildings like a disaster movie set, the corroded hulks of antiquated aircraft are conserved on this lively beach by Lake Victoria. The unlikely attraction is a mere stone’s throw from the abandoned control tower of Entebbe’s old airport, the scene of the Operation Entebbe hostage liberation in 1976. This Israeli Defence Force mission followed the hijacking of an Air France airliner en route from Tel Aviv to Paris. Though a persistent local legend claims that one of Aero Beach’s corroded exhibits is the original hijacked plane, none of the planes here were actually involved in the incident. The particular Air France aircraft that was hijacked was spared a rusty retirement as a giant lakeside climbing frame, having been salvaged by its owners following the hostage liberation. The airplane graveyard, which also boasts a bar and restaurant complex famed for its freshly caught tilapia dishes, is made more surreal by its series of selfie-magnet statues representing famous figures like Nelson Mandela, Queen Elizabeth II, Barack Obama, and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. In recognition of the historic rescue mission, a statue of Commander Yonatan Netanyahu of the Israeli Defence Force (the brother of Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu), who was killed during the operation, has been recently added to the collection.","Aero Beach is easy to find, on the left side of Airport Road before the security check point for Entebbe International Airport. It is passed by almost everyone arriving into Uganda by air. There is an entrance fee payable on the way in to the complex."
6,Kasubi Tombs Ruins,"Kampala, Uganda",The burial ground of four Buganda monarchs was nearly destroyed by a devastating fire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ruins-kasubi-tombs-of-uganda-kampala-uganda,"Situated on Kasubi hill, within Kampala, Uganda, the Kasubi Tombs site is an active religious place in the Buganda Kingdom, the largest of the traditional kingdoms in present-day Uganda To the millions of Baganda people the Kabaka, or ‘King’ of the Buganda people, is the unquestioned symbol of the spiritual, political, and social state of the Buganda Kingdom. As the burial ground for the previous four Kabakas, therefore, the Kasubi Tombs are a place where the Kabaka and others in Buganda’s complex cultural hierarchy frequently carry out important centuries-old Ganda rituals. In 2010, the complex was struck by a devastating disaster. The mausoleum and largest grass-thatched hut in the world was gutted by fire on March 16, 2010, at about 8.30 p.m. local time. The cause of the fire is as yet unknown. Fortunately, not all of the structures were completely destroyed. In 2014, restoration efforts backed by the Japanese government began. As such, this is still an active spiritual site and is still open to tourists.","The tombs have yet to recover from the 2010 fire, though what remains is open to visitors. As of winter 2019, admission cost 30,000 UGX. Be aware, however, that guides don't often stick to this number."
7,Nyero Rock Paintings,"Kumi, Uganda",Six rock shelters covered in abstract art created by ancient Ugandan tribes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nyero-rock-paintings,"The Neyro Rock Paintings, the oldest rock art in Uganda, consists of six panels of prehistoric art, including many geometric and abstract patterns. Painted in red and black pigment on six granite rock shelters, estimates put the rock art anywhere between 3,000 and 12,000 years old. Researchers believe they may have been created by the Karamojong tribe, semi-nomadic animal herders native to this region of Uganda. Visitors will have to hike to see most of the paintings, exploring some wonderful landscapes and weird rock formations along the way, as well as people living the local way of life.","There are no tour buses are going here; you will have to hire a car and drive up yourself. A guided tour is mandatory, which will cost 30,000 UGX ($1 USD is equal to about 3,800 Ugandan Shillings). You will also have to pay for your camera and/or video equipment, but this costs only a few dollars."
8,Semliki Safari Lodge,"Bughendera, Uganda","Nestled in Uganda's Semliki Valley Wildlife Reserve, is a one-of-a-kind safari lodge.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/semliki-safari-lodge,"Located in the Ugandan Semliki valley wildlife reserve, the Semliki Safari Lodge is in the Western Rift Valley, with over 500 sq. km of wilderness. The lodge is remote enough for a truly wild experience and yet, known for the best ‘lodge food in Uganda’. The main house is an open concept, built out of local materials, and wood. Guest lodgings are luxury tents with permanent thatched roofs, attached bathrooms with stunning panoramic views from the private veranda. With a maximum of 18 guests, Semliki Safari Lodge promises a secluded and intimate experience. The forest surrounding the lodge provides beautiful morning views of baboon, monkey, buffalo, kob, hyena, forest elephant and hundreds of bird species. Day and evening forest walks as well as guided wildlife drives are a pleasant way to see wildlife. Guests return to high-end food prepared from vegetables grown on the lodge grounds as well as local Fort Portal foods. In an effort to generate minimal waste via an active recycling program, the lodge uses solar-powered lanterns/lamps.","Enjoy the evening sunsets with a gin and tonic at the lodge's spectacular swimming pool facing the forest. Arrange a trip with the lodge management to Ntoroko, the border fishing village to get a glimpse of life in a traditional Ugandan border town."
9,Igongo Cultural Centre,"Mbarara, Uganda","One of the most detailed and historically accurate collections of Ugandan artifacts depicting Bahima tribal history, culture, and daily life.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/igongo-cultural-centre,"The Igongo Cultural Centre and Museum is on the former palace ground of the local Ankole king, located in Mbarara District in western Uganda. The museum is the largest exhibits center in Western Uganda. The museum has a vast collection of artifacts, exhibits of the agrarian and pastoral culture, history of political changes as well as present-day modernization of agricultural activities in the region. The Igongo Cultural Centre and Museum highlight the way of life of the tribes in southwestern Uganda, including the cattle herding tribe, Bahima, and how adaptable the region has been to new technologies and life. The tribe has collaborated with the University of Basel, Switzerland, on cheese making and milk pasteurization, which the museum has documented extensively as a success story of new technologies from Europe reaching Uganda. The museum is part of the Cultural Centre, which encompasses a state-of-the-art hotel with conference facilities. Day trips from the Centre include visits to the Biharwe Eclipse monument in Mbarara, honey farms, as well as evening entertainment and meetings with the Bahima tribespeople. The museum staff can arrange bespoke events that include afternoon sessions with the local tribespeople in eshawbwe-making from ghee/clarified butter made from Ankole cow milk, and millet bread-making. Other activities include trips to the local Ankole cow farm for a hands-on milking experience. The Centre has two restaurants that serve local, authentic Bahima and Ugandan food.","A rental car (with a local driver) to the centre can take you directly to most of western Ugandan parks, and activities around the center. The museum staff can guide you to local mosques and churches trips as well as a two-hour museum exhibits tour. The museum has a book store with local Ugandan publications, Bahima tribe jewelry and fabrics.

10,Kidepo Valley National Park,"Kaabong, Uganda",This park is home to around 500 bird species.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kidepo-valley-national-park,"Tucked away in the Northeastern part of Uganda lies Kidepo Valley National Park. This 557 square miles of pure wilderness borders South Sudan and Kenya. Nestled between the rugged hills of the semi-arid Karamoja, the park is nourished by two seasonal rivers, the Kidepo River and the Narus River. The Narus Valley is a permanent wetland that quenches the thirst of all the wildlife in the park. The vast and unending savanna plains, with an occasional acacia tree breaking through the landscape best describes Kidepo. The park is home to 77 mammal species and 500 bird species. These can be seen as visitors drive through the beaten tracks on a safari adventure. The vast herds of buffalo and elephants have become a trademark of the park. Rocky outcrops such as the Kakine rock and leopard rock are resting places for big carnivores Other mammal species include cheetahs, elands, zebras, Jackson’s hartebeests, stripped jackals, hyenas, and many more. Rare bird species such as ostriches, secretary birds, Kori bustards, pygmy falcons, and Egyptian vultures also call this park home. The national park is surrounded by a local group known as the Ik people. They reside in the neighboring hills and offer amazing cultural safaris. Their ancestral roots can be traced back to southern Egypt.","The park can be accessed by road or air. The park is open year-round, however, it's advisable to visit during the dry season from September to April. Wildlife safari activities include game drives, nature walks, as well as birding, cultural, and cycling safaris."
11,Jinja War Cemetery,"Jinja, Uganda",The final resting place of soldiers who fell during the First and Second World Wars.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jinja-war-cemetery,"Jinja War Cemetery is a peaceful and well-kept graveyard where rows of white headstones mark the final resting places of both European and African soldiers who died during World War I and World War II. Today, the city of Jinja on the banks of Lake Victoria is best known for two things: It’s the historic source of the Nile River, and is now one of the main hubs in East Africa for outdoor activities like kayaking, mountain biking, and quad biking. But before all this, Jinja was the center for the King’s African Rifles (KAR) in Uganda during the Second World War. Established in 1902, the KAR was a multi-battalion British colonial regiment that served in East Africa. Its rank and file was formed mainly from African soldiers known as askaris, while most of the officers were from the British Army. Starting in the 1960s, as former African colonies began achieving independence, the regiment began to break apart. The Jinja War Cemetery was created as the last resting place for fallen soldiers of the KAR, the vast majority of whom died during World War II. According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the cemetery contains only one First World War burial and 179 burials and commemorations from the Second World War. Most of the graves are those of Ugandans who fought and died with the KAR. There are only a handful of British graves, the most notable being that of Sergeant V.L. Holloway, who died in 1944 while serving in Great Britain’s Royal Army Service Corps. His headstone bears a famous line from the poem “The Soldier” by Rupert Brooke: “There’s some corner of a foreign field that is for ever England.” Also within the cemetery is the Jinja Memorial, a wall that commemorates more than 120 men of the East African Forces who died while serving in World War II. These men were buried in other parts of Uganda, but their graves were later deemed unmaintainable.","Jinja War Cemetery is located not far from the center of Jinja, along Kiira Road and Rotary Road. The cemetery is open Monday to Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m."
12,Kigungu Missionary Landing Site,"Entebbe, Uganda",A monument marks the spot where the first Catholic missionaries arrived in Uganda.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kigungu-missionary-landing-site,"In 1879, two French missionaries crossed Lake Victoria and landed on the Kigungu Peninsular. They were the first Catholic missionaries to arrive in Uganda, and an annual pilgrimage still convenes at the site of their landing. Today, Christianity is the dominant religion in Uganda. The majority of the population (around 80 percent) is Christian, with almost 40 percent identifying as Roman Catholic. And it all began when two French missionaries landed on the northern shores of Lake Victoria. On April 22, 1878, the First Caravan of a Roman Catholic society known as the White Fathers left Marseilles for Africa. The missionaries landed on Zanzibar on June 17, before heading on foot into the African interior. It was a challenging journey through unknown territory, and when the caravan reached Lake Victoria, only two of the group decided to push on across the lake. These two men, Father Simeon Lourdel and Brother Amans, crossed the lake and arrived near Entebbe on the Kigungu Peninsular on February 17, 1879—a day known recognized as the arrival of Catholicism in Uganda. The two missionaries continued north, passing through Kisubi and Rubaga, by which time their arrival had been brought to the attention of Muteesa I, the Kabaka (King) of the Kingdom of Buganda (a subnational kingdom which still exists in Uganda today). Muteesa I ordered that the two French missionaries be taken to Kitebi, where they spent 15 days, both suffering from fever. It was a crucial time for the missionaries. Food was scarce, and without approval from the king, their fates were very much in the balance. But on February 23, as the two men battled their fevers, Muteesa I sanctioned their arrival and sent canoes across the lake to bring the rest of the caravan to Uganda. Not long after, the missionaries visited Muteesa I at his capital of Banda-Kampala. He gave them Lubya Hill on which to build churches, schools, and hospitals. The king, meanwhile, continued to court other new arrivals, including Arab traders and Muslim missionaries, while at the same time fathering 98 children with his 87 wives. He was, if nothing else, a very busy man. Today, a brick monument marks the spot on which the two missionaries first landed in Uganda. At either side of the monument are statues of the two men, both kneeling, one in prayer and the other with hands raised towards the heavens. A plaque on the monument reads: “On this spot landed the first Catholic missionaries of Uganda on the 17th day of February in the year of our Lord 1879; Reverend Simeon Lourdel and Brother Amans of the society of the White Fathers.” Since the 1960s, the site has become an increasingly important pilgrimage destination among Uganda’s Catholic population. Each year on February 17, hundreds of pilgrims travel to Kigungu to commemorate the arrival of Christianity in Uganda, and to pay their respects to Father Simeon Lourdel and Brother Amans.","The monument is located near the Kigungu Catholic Church in Kigungu. The village is about three miles from Entebbe, and right next to Entebbe International Airport."
13,Devil's Swimming Pool,"Victoria Falls, Zambia",The world's highest and most dangerous infinity pool lies at the precipice of Victoria Falls.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devil-s-swimming-pool,"When the water running off of Victoria Falls is at a certain level, a small pool with almost no current forms which adventurous tourists have dubbed the Devil’s Swimming pool. Formed by a rock barrier at the edge of the falls, the water hole welcomes any daring swimmer the opportunity to wade right up to the edge of the falls themselves. However a small amount of deaths have occurred when people are swept over the edge. The pool is accessible during the hot dry season (usually between September and November, when the water level is at its lowest).","About a half mile walk from the falls. Great views of the Friendship Bridge from here! Access to the pool is gained from the Zambia side of the river, despite being approximately equidistant from Zimbabwe. Travelers should be prepared to drive, boat, hike, and finally swim to gain access to the pool. Water shoes are strongly recommended."
14,Kapishya Hot Springs,"Chinsali, Zambia",A secluded natural oasis hidden deep along a rainforest trail.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kapishya-hot-springs,"Tucked deep along a bushy rainforest trail is a serene hot spring surrounded by tangles of leafy trees. The secluded spot feels like a hidden gem within a corner of a sprawling 20th-century colonial estate. A retaining wall keeps the naturally heated reservoir at a perfect temperature—and keeps any curious crocodiles at bay. The springs have been well-managed for some time, and the grounds surely are a testament to the work put in over these many years. When you’re done soaking in the hot springs, you can explore all the scenic landscape has to offer. The grounds themselves are home to expansive gardens, as well as an expanding coffee plantation. The many paths are coated with an array of natural and exotic flora species, with descriptive markers on most of them. Just as you’re about lose yourself on the trail, the gate of the hot springs lodge comes into display with beauty surrounding every corner. With options to camp along the mighty river bank or cozy up in one of the chalets, the lodge has an array of activities that you could get lost in, such as white water rafting, hiking, and playing with puppies. Less than a mile down the road is an incredible scenic hike, allowing you to view deeply into the Shiwa valley.","From Lusaka, take one of the larger bus companies (Juldan, Power Tools, or Likili) headed toward Kasama. Getting off in Mpika to book a taxi to the hot springs directly, is the easiest, and cheapest, method of travel. The lodge is able to accommodate your travel needs, but the price of transport might be a bit higher. It is reliably safer, however."
15,Lusaka National Museum's Witchcraft Exhibit,"Lusaka, Zambia",Artifacts showcasing the witchy history of Zambia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lusaka-national-museum-s-witchcraft-exhibit,"The Lusaka National Museum is an impressive building on Independence Avenue that is dedicated to telling the story of Zambia. The museum is divided into sections: history, ethnography, art, the usual fare—but the fourth section is devoted to witchcraft. The witchcraft exhibit is a fascinating window into the traditional beliefs of Zambia, a blend of Christianity, superstition, and magic. Among the items on display are a snakeskin belt that helped a sorcerer sleep with another man’s wife while the husband was in the same bed, a collection of dolls responsible for all sorts of curses and maledictions, and a potion that allowed the wearer to magically steal crops from a neighbor’s fields. While many of the exhibits are relics of the past, there was a new addition to the museum in 2013 that involved a more contemporary, and cruel, form of witchcraft.  In June 2013, three brothers (Mika, Fabian, and Stephano) were killed by a coalition of the Zambian police and army.  The shootout was the culmination of a seven year search for the brothers who were responsible for murdering 12 people in cold blood. The Mailoni Brothers are well known in Southern Africa, and they have left Zambia with some disturbing, unanswered questions.  How could 3 illiterate brothers have avoided capture for seven years?  What drove them to murder?  Why were they carrying Christian iconography?  The answer, for many Zambians, is witchcraft. In July of that same year, the museum acquired the Mailoni brothers’ possessions: crude knives, spears, and a bow and arrow and added them to the witchcraft exhibit. In reality, the brothers represent a fundamental question that witchcraft, as well as all religions, attempt to answer—how can one protect themselves from the evil in this world?",Nasser and Independence Ave. Near the Freedom Statue.
16,Kasanka Bat Migration,"Serenje, Zambia",Zambia's smallest national park is home to one of the world's largest annual mammal migrations.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kasanka-bat-migration,"Located on the edge of the Bangweulu Wetlands, Kasanka National Park, the smallest and one of the lesser-known national parks in Zambia, is nonetheless a gem for wildlife lovers, home to a diverse array of habitats and animals. The high number of pans, papyrus swamps, dambos, and floodplains makes Kasanka an especially good haunt for birders, with more than 400 avian species recorded in the park. What the park is most notable for, however, is the enormous annual bat migration. Between November and December each year, some 5 million to 10 million straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) descend on the park to feast on the area’s musuku, mufinsa, and other fruit trees. Scientists are not sure exactly where the bats spend the rest of the year, though they are known to come from deep in the Congo rainforest. Visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of this thrilling sight are led on guided tours to various tree hides in the park during the dawn and dusk hours when the nocturnal creatures are especially active. There are so many bats that they darken the sky. The sheer number of bats makes this tradition one of the largest annual mammal migrations on the planet.","The park is managed by a unique private-public partnership known as the Kasanka Trust. The Trust is responsible for running all aspects of park operations. Reservations can be made by calling or emailing the park through their website. Although the park offers wildlife viewing throughout the year, the bat migration occurs in November and December."
17,Chirundu Fossil Forest,"Siavonga, Zambia",The petrified remains of 150-million-year-old trees can be seen in and among the houses of the local villagers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chirundu-fossil-forest,"About 150 million years ago, in what is now the Luangwa Valley, a totally different ecosystem flourished than the one found there today. At that time, large coniferous trees thrived, such as Dadyoxlon sp. and Rhexoxylon africanum. When these trees died, they were eventually buried and turned to stone. The site today contains a large number of extremely well-preserved ancient trees, with features such as tree rings and bark still visible on the fossils. Many of the trees are lying in what appears to be the same location and position as when they fell during the Jurassic Period. The fossils are in a large array of sizes, from small fragments to complete logs up to 30 feet long. Scientists posit that 150 million years ago, what is today a desert region enjoyed a more temperate and wet climate, favorable to growing tall coniferous trees, but also prone to storms and floods. A giant flood may have felled the large trees in this ancient forest, which were then preserved in a layer of soil and petrified as the organic materials were replaced by minerals. In modern times, the unique Chirundu Fossilized Forest is a National Monument of Zambia.","The Fossilized Forest is designated by a small marker on the right side of the road as you head towards Kariba on the Lusaka-Kariba Road. There is an example log near the marker and paths that lead around the area, but many of the most impressive logs are actually across the road. The local villagers will lead you to the best specimens if you ask nicely. It is illegal to remove any fossils from the site."
18,Chishimba Falls,"Kasama, Zambia",Arrogance and quarreling are forbidden near these three sacred waterfalls.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chishimba-falls,"The spellbinding beauty of these waterfalls isn’t the only thing keeping visitors on their best behavior. According to the tradition of the Bemba people, the watery wonder is home to the nature spirit Chishimba, who lives in a cave behind the falls. Because of the spirit’s presence, bad behavior, including fights, insults, and arrogance, is not allowed in the vicinity of the falls. Chishimba Falls is actually a series of three waterfalls along the Luombe River. The individual falls are named Mutumuna, Kaela, and Chishimba, and are separated by a distance of fewer than 1,000 feet. Though the Bemba people arrived in this area in the 17th century, they weren’t the first to call this spectacular sliver of nature home. The land surrounding the falls is dotted with evidence of Iron Age activities, including kilns, smelting pipes, and iron ore deposits. The falls are stunning in their natural beauty, with water cascading year-round over wide granite cliff faces. The falls are surrounded by thick mist forests, which provide a home to many birds and other wildlife. Trails throughout the park and several gazebos offer excellent views of each of the falls and access to the entire site.","The falls are located approximately 22 miles west of Kasama along the Kasama-Mporokoso Road. The road to the falls is marked by signs. At the, park an entry fee is collected and a visitor's center provides information about the falls. The falls also includes camping and picnic areas."
19,Kalambo Falls,Zambia,"This stunning waterfall is the backdrop to a site that has seen continuous human habitation for 250,000 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kalambo-falls,"In the Mbala district in Zambia, the Kalambo River forms the northern border of the country with Tanzania. Along the river is Kalambo Falls, a 725 foot (221 meters) high single-drop waterfall, making it the second-highest in Africa. Besides the stunning views, Kalambo Falls is an important archaeological site, with the earliest evidence of human habitation dating approximately 250,000 years ago until the present day. This makes Kalambo Falls one of the longest continuously inhabited areas in the world. From 1953 to 1963, archaeologist J.D. Clark made extensive excavations of the Kalambo Falls site. He found evidence of continuous habitation at the site dating to the early Stone Age. These finds included stone tools, hearths, and well-preserved organic objects. Kalambo Falls represents one of the strongest sites for evidence of early fire use by humans, with artifacts including charred logs, charcoal, and fire-hardened wooden implements dating to 60,000 years ago. Additional artifacts, such as heavy woodworking tools and burial sites, provide evidence of habitation in the region through the middle and late Stone Ages to the Iron Age, which saw the introduction of the Bantu people.","Kalambo Falls is located approximately 24 miles (40 kilometers) north of Mbala over dirt roads generally only accessible by 4x4s or skilled drivers. Taxi drivers in Mbala are willing to take visitors to the falls for 250-300 Zambian Kwatcha ($25-30 USD). Lake Chila Lodge in Mbala also organizes trips to the falls on Fridays and Saturdays. Once at the falls, there is an entry fee of seven Kwatcha for Zambian residents or $15 for visitors. The site has excellent walkways, with viewpoints that provide stunning vistas of the falls."
20,Nachikufu Cave,"Mpika, Zambia",This fascinating cave is packed with prehistoric rock art and Stone Age tools.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nachikufu-cave,"This cave is a must-see for any archaeology enthusiast. Excavations into its floor have revealed a long and detailed history of human habitation, dating to as far back as 15,000 to 20,000 years ago. In the pre-colonial era, the cave was also used by the Bisa and Lala people to hide from the Bemba and Ngoni raids. Archaeological digs have discovered evidence of three distinct Stone Age industries, dubbed Nachikufan I, II, and III. It’s the best such stone age sequence in Zambia, and does more than just hint at the area’s human history. In addition to the archaeological evidence, the cave contains several rock paintings, though many are unfortunately quite faded and difficult to see. There are three different types of paintings, including the only black rock paintings in Zambia. The earliest paintings include red, geometric paintings, and naturalistic paintings of elephants, antelope, and other animals done in a black silhouette. The most recent paintings are done in greasy white paints and depict tools and unidentified animals. The cave contains several small displays depicting enhanced pictures of the drawings in the cave, along with artifacts excavated in the cave. The displays explain the history of the site’s human habitation and are useful for explaining its archaeological history. In addition, viewpoints outside the cave provide excellent vantage points of the beautiful surrounding landscape.","The caretaker for the site lives just along the road on the way to the site, and will come to the cave when he sees cars or visitors passing by. The caretaker has the key to open the gate to the cave. If he doesn't arrive shortly after you park at the cave, his phone number is posted on the nearby sign. Parking is available at the site and it is accessible during daylight hours."
21,Mwela Rock Art Paintings,"Kasama, Zambia",One of the largest concentrations of rock paintings in Southern Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mwela-rock-art-paintings,"Head to the outskirts of Kasama, and you’ll find a series of rock outcroppings containing hundreds of paintings from Stone Age communities. It’s one of the largest collections of such paintings in all of Southern Africa. The rock outcroppings, which dominate the local landscape, contain numerous caves and were a natural gathering point for both animals and ancient humans. The majority of the paintings there are attributed to the Batwa. The paintings at the site, which covers an area of about 40 square miles, fall into two distinct categories. Some have a geometric or schematic style, while others follow a more realistic animal tradition. The geometric paintings include dots and lines arranged in squares, grids, circles, and ladders. Animals depicted in the paintings include elephants, elands, lions, bush pigs, and praying mantis. The paintings are thought to have either been guides to the animals that people hunted or used for ceremonies such as weather divination. Nearby archaeological digs have discovered Stone Age tools. These artifacts include blades, bored stones, dimpled anvils, grindstones, axes, and microliths. These tools, along with the rock painting, show that the area around modern Kasama has been continuously inhabited for thousands of years.","The site is located along the tarmac of the Mungwi road, heading east out of Kasama. Signs will point the way to the entrance. The site is open during daylight hours throughout the year, and a caretaker is present to collect the entry fee and provide a guided tour of the area. Many of the paintings are hidden or faint, so the guide is invaluable is spotting the paintings and providing a history of the area. Parking is available at the entrance."
22,Niamkolo Church,"Mpulungu, Zambia","Now abandoned, this stone church was part of the missionary efforts that initiated the Christianization of Zambia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/niamkolo-church,"This defunct church on the shores of Lake Tanganyika may no longer be active, but it remains a potent historical marker of how British colonialism changed Zambia forever. Missionaries first came to the region in the 1880s. The expansion of European empires heightened interest in mission societies, who saw opportunity in newly colonized territories and their native peoples. Inspired by the travels and writings of missionary explorer David Livingstone, several different missionary societies moved to establish missions in the central African regions he explored. The London Missionary Society, with which Livingstone first began his travels, was the first of these organizations to establish a mission in what would become Zambia. The mission’s lakeside location positioned it to readily welcome travelers arriving by boat, causing it to flourish. It did so well that between 1895 and 1896, the mission upgraded to a large stone church overlooking the lake. The church served as a place of worship continuously until 1908, when the mission moved inland to avoid the sleeping sickness carried by tsetse flies near the lake. The original church has been declared a national monument in Zambia. It’s the oldest surviving stone church in the country. Though its walls still stand, the roof is no more.","The churchyard is accessible 24/7 without an entry fee, though visitors are asked not to enter the church itself and only view it from the outside."
23,Itimbwe Gorge,"Mbala, Zambia",A series of caves within the gorge hold artifacts from the Stone Age.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/itimbwe-gorge,"Itimbwe Gorge is a small but beautiful valley cutting through the escarpment east of Mbala, Zambia. The gorge walls are lined with a series of caves formed from when the silica in the rock dissolved away as groundwater penetrated from above. Archaeological excavations of the caves revealed artifacts such as buried pots and stone tools—including awls and scrapers—that date back to the Stone Age. The different caves in the valley show different levels of habitation, from occasional use by hunters to long and continuous use revealed by artifacts throughout the strata of the cave floors. Unfortunately, the most recent archaeological work on the site was in the 1950s. A lack of funds or interest has prevented further excavations of the caves since then. In modern times, the gorge is still inhabited by farmers, and an old homestead can be found at the bottom of the gorge. Although game is rare in the area, the hills are easily accessible and offer stunning views of the plains to the west of the escarpment.","Although a good dirt road leads to the valley, the gorge and the caves are unmarked and there are no signs to guide the way. The best option for adventurous travelers is to use a map program and GPS to ensure you are going the right away. The turnoff to the gorge is located approximately four miles down the Nakonde road as you are coming from the turnoff to Mbala. The caves are on the right-hand side of the gorge as you are descending down the escarpment."
24,Source of the Zambezi,Zambia,Africa's fourth longest river originates from a burbling spring in a secluded stretch of woods.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/source-of-the-zambezi,"A small spring gurgles within a lush forest. It may seem humble, but it’s actually the origin of a mighty waterway. The Zambezi is Zambia’s most important river. It gives the country its name, and it most famously flows over Victoria Falls. Along the Barotse floodplain, it’s the location of Zambia’s most famous cultural ceremony, the Kuomboka of the Litunga. It’s the fourth longest river in Africa, and it gets its start along its 1,677-mile (2,700-kilometer) journey to the Indian Ocean from a small spring in the Northwestern corner of Zambia. The Source of the Zambezi is located in a small protected forest. It’s surrounded by a rich Miombo woodland and a strip of Mushitu forest. The area is rich in biodiversity, with nearly 200 bird species and mammals including the Tree Pangolin, Long Footed Rat, Red-Tailed Monkey, and African Palm Civet. Within the protected forest, elevated wooden walkways lead to the source and follow the path of the river down the valley for some distance. The source itself is a small spring that bubbles beneath the bottom of a fallen tree. A visitor’s center explains the importance of the Zambezi River, and provides information on the forest environment. The site also includes a monument to mark the Independence of Zambia, unveiled on 24th October 1964.","The site is located approximately 34 miles (54 kilometers) from Mwinilunga along a dirt road that is in the process of being improved. The best way to reach the source would be to take a taxi from Mwinilunga, or to drive a private vehicle with four-wheel drive. There is a sign to mark the turnoff to the source along the Mwinilunga-Ikilenge road. Camping is available at the site."
25,Fort Zombe,"Zombe, Zambia",The ruins of a massive World War I fort overlook the border between Zambia and Tanzania.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-zombe,"Stretches of stone spill across a hill overlooking both Zambia and Tanzania. It’s a remnant of Fort Zombe, one of the area’s most significant fortifications built during World War I. During World War I, British forces in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) had to defend their border with Tanzania (then German East Africa). The fort was constructed between 1917 and 1918, when the war in Africa was intensifying. It was built to give the British troops the ability to keep an eye out for any German advances. The site itself its surrounded by an outside enclosure measuring just over one mile (approximately two kilometers) all around. Today, this outer stone wall has collapsed, but it was reported to be about 13 feet (four meters) high and very thick. Along the outside enclosure are small structures that appear to have been sniper points. Inside the outer wall are other structures, including those believed to have been bunkers, sleeping quarters, and storage spaces for food and weapons. Also the top of the hill, approximately 330 feet (about 100 meters) from inside fortifications, are the remains of a gravesite reported by the local villagers to have held the remains of the last soldier killed in Zambia during the war. The grave was reportedly exhumed by “foreigners” in the 1980s, and the modern remains include a concrete slab reading “erected by E P Chesnaye, est dist comm., Abercorn” (Abercorn was the colonial-era name of Mbala). At the foot of the hill is a Y-shaped trench that protects the water source for the fort. Throughout the site, it’s still possible to find artifacts of the occupation, including food tins and bottles. Besides the history of the site, the location provides beautiful views of the surrounding valleys and mountains into Tanzania.","To visit the site, it is necessary to ask permission from Chief Zombe. The Chief's palace is located in Zombe village, approximately nine miles (15 kilometers) north of Mbala along the Mbala-Kasesha road. Any of the villagers will be able to direct you to the palace. Once at the palace (a regular-sized house), you must then greet the Chief and ask permission to visit the fort. A small gift (50-100 Zambian Kwatcha) is appropriate. He will either take you to the fort himself or have someone bring you there. For information regarding the fort, it is best to visit the Moto Moto Museum in Mbala and ask one of the staff there to explain about the fort."
26,Ndola Slave Tree,"Ndola, Zambia","Once a meeting point for Swahili slave traders, this ancient tree is now a monument to those killed by the slave trade.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ndola-slave-tree,"Ndola is one of the most prominent towns in Zambia’s Copperbelt province. Today, the numerous copper mines in the region provide the region’s wealth. But in the past, a darker industry spurred the settlement. Still standing near the center of town, the Slave Tree was the central location where Swahili slave traders met to discuss their gruesome transactions. Under its shade, Swahili traders such as Chipembere, Mwalabu, and Chiwala held councils of war and sold enslaved people to the Mambundu from Angola. Much of central and southern Africa, including modern-day Zambia, was crisscrossed by slave traders transporting human captives to the Swahili coast to be sold to Arab slave traders. These traders would enslave people themselves or buy people who had been captured by warring local tribes. Slavery was abolished in Zambia early in the 1900s, when the British Colonial Administration was established. The town of Ndola itself was founded in 1904 after the discovery of copper at the Bwana Mkubwa mine at the site of the slave trading post. The Slave Tree was left standing as a monument to the lives lost to the slave trade.",The Slave Tree is near the center of Ndola along Makoli Avenue. It is surrounded by a small fence with an open gate. The tree can be visited at any time.
27,Chambeshi Monument,"Kasama, Zambia",A stone memorial marks the spot where the fighting of World War I finally ceased—three days after the armistice was signed in Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chambeshi-monument,"The armistice of World War I was supposed to end all fighting on November 11, 1918, at 11 o’clock. Unfortunately, German forces in East Africa, led by General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, did not get the news until three days later. Thus, a monument in Zambia marks the spot where the hostilities of the First World War finally ended, on November 14th. The German general had led a largely successful campaign in East Africa, using guerrilla attacks and keep British forces occupied and away from the fronts in Europe. At the end of the war, he had entered northern Rhodesia (modern-day Zambia) and was marching near the city of Kasama to avoid British forces concentrated near Abercorn (modern-day Mbala). German forces captured the city on November 13, two days after the armistice that formally ended the war. A day later, on the 14th, General von Lettow-Vorbeckwas handed a telegram by a citizen of Kasama, Hector Croad, informing the general of the end of the war. The spot is marked by the Chambeshi Monument, located just north of the Chambeshi River in Kasama. The memorial consists of a large concrete platform, on top of which sit a German cannon and a stone pillar with two plaques: one in English commemorating the event, and one in Bemba honoring the soldiers that fought in the war. After being notified of the armistice, General von Lettow-Vorbeck was ordered by British forces to march north to Abercorn to surrender his forces. A pillar there marks the formal surrender.","The monument is located off the Great North Road, just north of the Chambeshi river approximately 100km south of Kasama. When heading north on the Great North Road, there is a sign on the left hand side of the road just after the Chambeshi River bridge. A path leads to the monument, and the caretaker of the monument will come to meet you to show you the way."
28,Livingstone Memorial,"Serenje, Zambia",An obelisk marks the spot where a British explorer's heart was buried before the rest of his body was transported to England.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/livingstone-memorial,"In 1866, the famed British missionary and explorer Dr. David Livingstone set off for what was to be his last African journey. In 1873, while attempting to map the rivers flowing into and out of the Bangweulu wetlands, he contracted dysentery and eventually died at age 60 in the village of Chief Chitambo in Zambia. Death was not to be the end of the journey for Dr. Livingstone, however. His attendants, Chuma and Susi, wanted to return his body to his homeland in the United Kingdom. They removed his heart and viscera, smeared his body with salt, and allowed it to dry for 14 days in the sun. They then carried his body 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) to the coast, from it was transported back to England and eventually buried with national honors at Westminster Abbey in London. The spot where Dr. Livingstone’s heart and viscera were buried was originally marked by an inscription carved into a mvula tree. In 1899, the tree was cut down and the carving transported to the Royal Geographical Society in London. In 1902, a memorial was constructed on the burial site in the form of a stone obelisk with two brass plaques. The monument has been maintained throughout the years and the plaques have been replaced. A third plaque was added in 1973 to mark the centennial of Dr. Livingstone’s death. Next to the memorial is a mvula tree descended from the original tree that marked the spot.","The monument is located 26km off the Mansa road. From the Great North Road, travel 97km towards Mansa. On the right, follow the sign marking the turnoff to Chief Chitambo's Palace. Signs further down the road will direct you to the memorial. It will be easiest to hire transportation to take you directly to the monument. Otherwise, it is easiest to hitch towards the site in the afternoons when people are returning to the villages and then stay the night, camping at the memorial site. Plan to return to the tarmac the next morning. At the monument, a very knowledgeable caretaker will greet you and collect the entry fee."
29,Kifubwa Stream Rock Shelter,"Solwezi, Zambia",Rare pigmented engravings cover the walls of this Stone Age shelter.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kifubwa-stream-rock-shelter,"A beautiful swath of nature hides a prehistoric secret. There, etched into a rock shelter, are the marks of the people who called this land home thousands of years ago. The Kifubwa Stream Rock Shelters are located along a picturesque valley on the Kifubwa Stream. The most stunning feature of the rock shelters is a series of engravings underneath a series of rock overhangs. These engravings consist almost entirely of geometric line markings and “U” motifs. They were made using the “incision technique,” where the stone of the rock shelter was repeatedly rubbed or chipped away using harder stones. Unusual for Zambia, these engravings were combined with painting, as red pigment was used to color in the engravings. The Kifubwa Stream Rock Shelters were first discovered by Western scholars in 1928. Excavations of the floor of the rock shelters revealed evidence of Late Stone Age hunter-gather occupation, carbon dated to between 6,000 and 6,500 years ago. A the time, it was the first site to show a clear connection between local rock engravings and Late Stone Age communities.","The site is located approximately 3.7 miles (six kilometers) from the center of town, down a well-marked dirt road. It's open during daylight hours throughout the year, and a gatekeeper will collect the entry fee. Well-maintained stairs lead you to the rock shelter and engravings, and a few trails lead to picturesque overlooks. The site is easily accessible by taxi or private car."
30,Mbala Surrender Monument,"Mbala, Zambia","A memorial in the middle of a roundabout marks the spot where German forces formally surrendered, finally ending World War I in Africa.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mbala-wwi-surrender-monument,"After the signing of the armistice of World War I on November 11, 1918, it took three days for German forces in East Africa to learn of the end of the war. On November 14th, German General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck was delivered a telegraph informing him of the end of hostilities, and was ordered by British forces to march north to the town of Abercorn to formally surrender his forces. A memorial in Abercorn, modern-day Mbala, marks the rough location where the German forces laid down their arms. The small monument, situated on a small grassy circle in the middle of a roundabout in the center of town, features two plaques commemorating the historic event. During the war, General von Lettow-Vorbeck had led an effective guerrilla campaign to keep British forces occupied and away from the front lines in Europe. At the end of the war, his forces entered the British colony of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and captured the town of Kasama. There, the general finally learned of the armistice that had been signed in Europe three days prior. This event is marked by the Chambeshi Monument in Kasama. The British command then ordered General von Lettow-Vorbeck to march his forces to Abercorn, approximately 155 miles to the north, near the border of German East Africa (modern-day Tanzania). On November 25, 1918, a formal surrender was held in Abercorn, marking the final end of the Great War in Africa. Following the surrender, the German forces were directed to throw their weapons into the nearby Lake Chila, and then returned to German East Africa. German weapons remain to this day at the bottom of the lake. Examples of some of the weaponry recovered from the lake can be seen in the nearby Moto Moto Museum.","The monument is located near the center of Mbala in the middle of a roundabout on President's Way. The monument is accessible for free 24/7. From November 20-25, 2018, Centennial Celebrations will be held to mark the 100th anniversary of the formal surrender on this spot in 1918."

He was flying, along with 18 other members of the UN staff and other international officials, to Ndola to meet with the prime minister of Katanga Province. As the plane was preparing to land in Ndola, it crashed, skimming the tops of the trees and finally hitting down near an anthill. A fireball was seen from Ndola, but rescue personnel were unable to reach the site until daybreak. Dag Hammarskjöld’s body was found in a seated position at the foot of the anthill, and the other passengers were people found closer to the wreckage. In the years since, there have been several investigations into the crash trying to determine whether the plane was sabotaged or shot down, but no conclusive evidence has ever been found. Today, an expansive memorial stands at the crash site. A plaque marks the exact spot at the foot of the anthill where the Secretary-General’s body was found, and a monument surrounded by quotes from Dag Hammarskjöld commemorates the mission of the plane’s passengers. A small museum at the site explains the circumstances of the peace mission and the crash, and the work of the United Nations.","The site is located about 15 kilometers from Ndola. A taxi from town should be able to take you there, or you can drive on your own and park at the site. A caretaker at the site will collect the entry fee and explain the site.

32,Freedom Statue,"Lusaka, Zambia","Based on a real event, the statue is dedicated to those who fought and died for Zambia's independence.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/freedom-statue,"In front of the government offices in downtown Lusaka stands the Zambian Freedom Statue. The artwork depicts a man breaking free from chains, representing the struggles Zambians faced while overthrowing the chains of colonialism. It’s now such a potent symbol of Zambia that it’s depicted on all denominations of the country’s currency, the Kwatcha. The statue was erected in 1974 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Zambia’s independence. Although the country had a relatively peaceful transition, winning independence without a civil war or armed revolution, the struggle toward freedom was still long. It also, unfortunately, involved occasional violent suppression from the colonial government. This symbolic monument honoring the freedom fighters who died during the conflicts was inspired by a real event. The man immortalized in the artwork is Zanco Mpundu Mutembo, a native to the Zambian town of Mbala. After a trial following his arrest for protesting, Mutembo was sent to Livingstone Prison, where he was held in chains. With 18 armed soldiers facing him, he was ordered to break free from his constraints or be shot instantly. Summoning great strength, he managed to break the chains. Today, the Freedom Statue is a popular gathering place on Africa Day (May 25). On Zambian Independence Day (October 24), a wreath is laid to honor the freedom fighters that lost their lives.",The statue is outside the New Government Complex (near the National Museum) along Independence Avenue. It is accessible for free 24/7.
33,Hulk of the SS Good News,"Mpulungu, Zambia",The forgotten remains of the first steamship that launched on Lake Tanganyika.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hulk-of-the-ss-good-news,"Forgotten and mostly buried in Kituta Bay on Lake Tanganyika lay the remains of the first steamship that launched on these waters, in 1885. After being shelled by a German warship at the outbreak of World War II, the ship was left grounded for decades and all but disappeared into the overgrowth. By the early 1880s, the London Missionary Society was established in the lands surrounding Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa, one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world. Preaching Christianity from their bases at Niamkolo and Ujiji, the lake offered a vital thoroughfare for the society to bring people and supplies to their missions. Although they already had a sailing vessel on the lake that they had shipped overland from Dar Es Salaam, a donation allowed the society to purchase and a steam vessel and transport it to the lake via the newly created Stevenson Road. It was dubbed the SS Good News. The Good News was a sturdy and high-quality ship, built of mild steel with a deck and woodwork of Indian teak. In addition to its steam engine, it had sails to aid in propulsion. It was 54 feet long with a beam of 12 feet. It had been specially designed to be broken apart into relatively small pieces suitable for overland transport and reassembly on the lake. Building the Good News became the responsibility of Edward C. Hore, a master mariner after whom Hore Bay on Lake Tanganyika is now named. When he arrived, he found much of the local population devastated by recent raids by slave traders from Zanzibar. He therefore chose a relatively remote location on the Lofubu River to construct the ship. With the first parts of the Good News arriving in 1883, it took Mr. Hore and his team two years to complete construction. The ship was launched and sailed its first miles under steam in 1885. The SS Good News lead a relatively successful career helping the London Missionary Society supply its stations and maintain contact with the communities around Lake Tanganyika. But by the outbreak of World War I, it had been permanently beached on the shores of Kituta Bay. Nonetheless, at the start of hostilities, the hull was shelled by a German warship to prevent the British from re-floating and arming the ship. It remained upright and above ground on Kituta Bay until at least the 1960s. At some point, due to neglect, the ship has fallen, and it is now largely buried, though some easily distinguishable hull plates and other components of the ship can still be seen peeking out from the overgrowth.","The remains of the SS Good News can be found in Kituta Bay on Lake Tanganyika. Kituta Bay is accessible via a walking trail from Mpulungu, or via 4x4 along a road that passes through Isoko. Once in the bay it will be necessary to ask around in the local village for the exact location of the ship. As a favor, the local villagers can lead you to the spot. The hulk is technically under the responsibility of the Moto Moto Museum, found in Mbala. The propeller of the Good News has been well preserved, however, and is on display at the Tanganyika Victoria Memorial Institute (TVMI) in Mbala."
34,Mbala Pioneer Cemetery,"Mbala, Zambia",A small cemetery on a hill overlooking Mbala contains the history of the town's colonial past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mbala-pioneer-cemetery,"Due to its strategic location, Mbala was one of the first places that the British colonial administration established an outpost in Africa’s Great Lakes region. The outpost was located on the site of Chief Zombe’s village in 1893 and was dubbed Abercorn. This long colonial history is reflected in the graves found today at the Pioneer Cemetery on Cemetery Hill, across the Lucheche river and overlooking the town of Mbala. The oldest graves at the cemetery are those of the early colonial administrators. The most famous of these is the grave of Hector Croad, the District Commissioner for Kasama, who was tireless in mapping and exploring the region. The maps he made would prove vital during World War I, as they were often the only maps available for the area. Croad was later chosen to deliver a telegraph to the commander of the German forces in the area, General Von Lettow-Vorbeck, informing him that the war was over. The general, unbelieving that this could be true, asked to send a telegram to the Kaiser, to which Croad replied: “There is no Kaiser.” The bodies of the military personnel that died fighting in the area were originally buried in the Pioneer Cemetery. After the war, these bodies were exhumed and re-buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Ndola, Zambia. A plaque outside the cemetery describes the military service of the 29 service members originally buried at the cemetery. A more surprising set of graves are those of a number of Polish refugees. During and after the Second World War, a number of Polish refugees fleeing the Soviet Union were settled in various parts of Southern Africa. The last of these camps was located in Mbala from 1943 until 1948. The site was dubbed “Little Poland,” and housed approximately 600 Polish refugees. The camp is remembered by Little Poland Street in Mbala, and by 18 graves of Polish refugees in the Pioneer Cemetery. These graves were restored by the Polish Embassy in South Africa in 2015, and are marked with white gravestones and steel crosses. The Pioneer Cemetery still sees the occasional burial, though most burials now take place at the nearby Mutambilike Cemetery. The grounds become very overgrown in the rainy season, although occasional maintenance takes place.","The Pioneer Cemetery is located just outside town, on Cemetery Hill along the Kasesha Road. There is a plaque located at the entrance to the cemetery describing some of the history. The cemetery is always open."
35,Zwangendaba's Gravesite,"Nteko, Zambia","A Zulu warrior is buried far from home, near the very northern border of Zambia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zwangendabas-gravesite,"In 1816, King Chaka established the Zulu nation with such force and violence that it drove many Zulu tribes out of South Africa in an event known as the Mfecane. One of these groups was the Jere clan, who under the leadership of King Zwangendaba, would spend the next 20 years on a trek through southern Africa. Zwangendaba and his clan first fled to Mozambique under General Shoshangane, where Shoshangane established the Shangaan chiefdom. There, Zwangendaba parted ways with General Shoshangane and continued north into Zimbabwe, where he clashed with the Ndebele, another displaced Zulu tribe. Zwangendaba and his clan traveled farther north, eventually crossing the Zambezi river into modern-day Zambia on November 19, 1835, a day marked as auspicious by a total eclipse of the sun. In Zambia, Zwangendaba continued to move north, using his warriors to raid local tribes for cattle. By 1845, they had reached modern-day Tanzania, where they fought the Ufipa people to establish a territory for themselves. During one of these battles, Zwangendaba was injured by a poisoned arrow, causing his warriors to retreat back south. They camped near Tongola Hill and used herbs to try to cure their leader, but Zwangendaba died. His grave was marked by large stones and logs, and today it has been reduced to a circular pile of stones marked by a modern-day sign. Southern Africa continues to feel the effects of the march of Zwangendaba and other Zulu tribes out of South Africa. After Zwangendaba’s death, the tribe split up under the leadership of his sons, Mpezeni, Mperembe, and Mbelwa, and continued their journeys. Mpezeni’s people traveled south again, settling near modern-day Chipata (in Zambia’s Eastern Province) and intermarrying with the Nsenga people. Every year at the end of February, the Ncwala festival takes place which re-enacts Zulu traditions with thousands of people dressed as warriors. The first fruits of the season are tasted, the Chief drinks sacred blood from a speared black cow, and a singer recites praises in the Zulu language, preserved in a royal court far from the Zulu homeland.","Zwangendaba's grave is located approximately 18.6 miles from Nakonde along the Nakonde-Mbala Road. Traveling from Nakonde, the turnoff is to the left just after the marker denoting 159 kilometers to Mbala, and just before the railroad crossing. Turn left and travel about 0.8 miles down the dirt road. At forks, stay on the largest road. The grave is marked by a green sign and is maintained by a caretaker who lives next door."
36,Zesco Cooling Tower,"Lusaka, Zambia",The abandoned tower is the last remnant of Lusaka's first major power plant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zesco-cooling-tower,"At first glance, many people assume the large cooling tower on the western side of the city is for a nuclear power plant. Although no longer operational, the cooling tower actually served a coal-fired power plant, and was the first major source of electrical power for the then-budding city of Lusaka, soon to be designated Zambia’s (then Northern Rhodesia’s) capital. The city of Lusaka was established in 1905 and named after the headman of the village where it was founded. By the early 1930s, the British authorities were looking to move the capital of Northern Rhodesia away from Livingstone, and Lusaka was a natural choice due to its central location and proximity to the railroads. Moving the capital to Lusaka meant the area needed a power station. The location of the power station was chosen for its easy access to the railroads (and therefore coal supply), the burgeoning industrial area, and the prevailing winds, which carried smoke and soot away from the plant. The power plant began operating in 1934. It was the first major power plant in Lusaka and the second in Zambia, after the power plant constructed in Ndola to support the copper mines. Today, over 90 percent of Zambia’s electricity is from hydroelectric power. The cooling tower and power plant ceased operation in 1970 and has not been used for power generation since. The cooling tower remains a looming landmark over the skyline of Lusaka, and stands as a representative of the engineering heritage in Zambia.","The cooling tower is located on the grounds of ZESCO's headquarters and cannot be accessed by the public. However, it can be seen from afar from a variety of locations. It stands directly behind the Levy Junction Shopping Mall."
37,Stevenson Road,"Mbala, Zambia",This little-known colonial road helped determine the Zambia-Tanzania border.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stevenson-road,"In the early days of European exploration and colonization in Africa, the only way to reach Lake Tanganyika, one of the African Great Lakes, was via an overland route from Dar Es Salaam to Ujiji. This was the route many explorers took to the lake, including David Livingstone and Henry Morgan Stanley. However, this route was controlled by the Muslim traders who dominated what would become the country of Tanzania. The control of the overland route by the Muslim traders had several impacts on the Europeans in the area. For the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, it meant they could easily be cut off from their missions on Lake Tanganyika, such as the Niamkolo mission on the southern end of the lake. For traders and others with commercial interests, it meant that the Muslim traders dominated the trade in the region, including the lucrative ivory trade and the trade of enslaved people. Creating an alternative route to the lake was, therefore, a viable option for both European traders and missionaries alike. James Stevenson, a Glasgow manufacturer and ardent supporter of African missions, hatched a plan to construct a road between the northern end of Lake Malawi (then Nyasa) and the southern end of Lake Tanganyika. This route was attractive for several options. People traveling via ship up the Shire River, along the length of Lake Nyasa, over the proposed Stevenson Road, and along the length of Lake Tanganyika could penetrate 1,400 miles into the continent’s interior with only 275 miles of overland travel. The relatively high plateau between the lakes was believed to be fairly free of the tsetse fly, making the use of draft animals possible, and the route would be over entirely British-claimed territory. Construction on the road eventually began in 1881 after a donation by Stevenson to the London Missionary Society, and the Society’s agreement to ship a small steamship (The SS Good News, the first steamship on Lake Tanganyika) via the Stevenson Road. Unfortunately, due to the difficulties of the terrain and the death of Stevenson in 1885, the Stevenson Road was in many parts more theoretical than an actual road. That did not, however, diminish its impact. Several missions and towns were eventually set up along the path of the road, such as Mambwe Mission, which helped to monitor and counter the slave trade in Africa. Other towns, such as Mbala and Fife, would be important during World War I. And when the German and British representatives at the “Scramble for Africa” were dividing the borders between themselves, the line between the eventual countries of Zambia and Tanzania was drawn parallel to, but just short of, the Stevenson Road.","The Stevenson Road today has largely been either replaced with modern tarmac road or bypassed. Some of the easiest portions of the intact road to see are near the Zambian town of Mbala. Approximately half a mile north of Mbala, there are well-preserved portions leading up to Cemetery Hill, and the along East-West road north of Lake Chila. A dirt road leading west out of Mbala to Isoko and then to the road's terminus in Kituta Bay on Lake Tanganyika is part of the original Stevenson Road. Further information about the road can be found at the Moto Moto Museum, about a mile outside Mbala."
38,Mbala Old Prison,"Mbala, Zambia",This old brick building has held everyone from prisoners of war to freedom fighters during its turbulent history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mbala-old-prison,"This abandoned red-brick building, known as the Mbala Old Prison, was built in 1912 by the British colonial administration back when Mbala (known then as Abercorn) was the seat of the colonial presence in Northern Rhodesia. It is now maintained as a historic building and a Zambian National Monument due to its long and poignant history. When World War I broke out in 1914, the Mbala prison was turned into a defense post for the Northern Rhodesia Police, which was the colonial military. The site was well-suited to repel German attacks over the nearby border from German East Africa (modern-day Tanzania). As the fighting progressed, the Old Prison was used to house German prisoners of war. When the war ended in 1918, the prison was then used to accommodate German Askaris—Africans drafted as soldiers to fight for the colonial powers—until they could be repatriated to their homelands. Later, prominent freedom fighters such as Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe, Zambia’s first vice president, were imprisoned here. Today the building stands empty and disused, preserved as a national monument and one of the oldest prisons in Zambia. Its duties as a prison have been taken over by the new Mbala Prison, located next door.",The prison can be viewed from the street at all times. Visitors interested in learning about the history of Mbala should visit the nearby Moto Moto Museum.
39,'Broken Hill Man' Monument,"Kabwe, Zambia",The skull of an ancient hominid was discovered at this spot.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/broken-hill-man-monument,"On June 17th, 1921, a Swiss miner working in a lead mine in modern-day Zambia came across a mostly complete skull of an ancient human. Tom Zwigelaar was working in the Broken Hill mine in the modern-day city of Kabwe, when the country Zambia was still Northern Rhodesia. An English paleontologist, Arthur Smith Woodward, later assigned the skull as the type specimen for a new species of hominid he dubbed Homo rhodesiensis. This discovery established Broken Hill as an important center for the study of early humankind. In modern times, the skull has been dated to between 300,000 and 125,000 years old. The classification of the skull as Homo rhodesiensis has also largely been discarded, with the “Broken Hill Man,” as the remains became known, generally classified as Homo heidelbergensis. The skull itself currently resides in the Natural History Museum in London. Zambia, however, has made efforts to repatriate the fossil. In the meantime, a monument to the discovery of the Broken Hill Man has been erected on the grounds of the Civic Center in Kabwe. The plaque on the monument is written in both English and Bemba.","The monument is located on grounds of the Civic Center in Kabwe, Zambia. The Civic Center is on Freedom Way, east from the Big Tree and next to Tusker's. The Civic Center keeps normal business hours but the monument is best viewed from the always-accessible sidewalk in front of the center."
40,Chilubula Mission,"Mporokoso, Zambia",The first Catholic Mission to the Bemba people of Zambia still stands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chilubula-mission,"Chilubula Mission was founded in 1899 by Father Joseph Dupont of the White Fathers Missionary Society. Prior to the arrival of Father Dupont, Paramount Chief Chitimukulu of the Bemba people of Northern Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) was violently opposed to any missionaries operating in his territory. Father Dupont had first arrived at Mambwe Mission, to the north of Bemba territory, and worked to learn a great deal about Bemba culture and tradition. He was nicknamed “Moto Moto” (Fire Fire in Bemba), apparently due to his fondness for smoking a pipe. Eventually, some of the other Bemba chiefs allowed Father Dupont to start a mission at Chilubula, nearby modern-day Kasama. The mission itself includes a very large church, erected between 1899-1909, with huge Roman influence demonstrated by many Roman semicircular arches. It has been compared to a citadel because of its strength, and during the First World War served as a refuge to people fleeing the fighting between German and British forces. The site celebrates its founding by Father Dupont, with a marker identifying the location where he first pitched his tent at Chilubula under a Musashi tree, along with his dedication of the site. The Mission continues to serve the local people with a clinic on the site and St. Teresa Girl’s Secondary School. Father Dupont left Chilubula Mission in 1911 and eventually died in Tunisia in 1930. In 2000, his remains were moved and re-interred at Chilubula Mission. His grave is located inside the church to the left of the Sanctuary. Besides his legacy at Chilubula Mission, Father Dupont is also the namesake of the Moto Moto Museum located in Mbala, Zambia, which houses a very large ethnographic collection of Bemba artifacts.","To reach the Mission, head west from Kasama along the Kasama-Luwingu Road. After approximately 23km, turn right onto D20 (Mporokoso Road). Follow signs towards St. Theresa Girl's Secondary School and Chishimba Falls. After another 6km, turn left onto a dirt road that will lead you the directly to the Mission. The grounds of the Mission are accessible at all times, and the grave of Father Dupont is located inside the church. Besides services on Sunday, workers at the Mission should be able to let you inside to view the grave if you ask politely."
41,Great Zimbabwe,"Masvingo, Zimbabwe","The largest prehistoric ruins south of the Sahara, once a powerful center of international trade.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-zimbabwe,"The ruins of this once-magnificent city are rich in historical significance, architectural wonders, and unsolved mysteries. Until fairly recently, the origin of Great Zimbabwe was a contentious issue among Western archeologists, most of whom initially refused to believe such an impressive and complex structure could be the work of native Africans. When Portuguese traders first described the massive city in the 16th century, the site was popularly believed to be one of the fabled cities built by the Queen of Sheba. Nineteenth-century archeologists posited that the city was of Egyptian or Phoenician origin. With reasoning characteristic of the racial attitudes that defined the era of Western colonization of Africa, the presence of indigenous artifacts in the city was regarded as evidence not of the original builders, but of the subsequent occupation. Attempts by Westerners to establish a non-African race as the city’s original designers resulted in the removal and destruction of numerous original artifacts and a devastating loss of archeological evidence. Despite this loss, objective findings by 20th-century archeologists eventually led to the conclusion that the city was indeed of African origin, though such findings were later repressed in attempts to undermine the African Nationalist movement. Today the builders are widely recognized to be ancestors of the Shona tribe, one of the region’s Bantu-speaking groups. The name “Zimbabwe” is said to have come from the phrase “dzimba dza mabwe” in the Karanga dialect, meaning roughly “houses of stone”. Great Zimbabwe is estimated to have been built between 1100 and 1450 AD, and its ruins span roughly 1,800 acres. The city, which may have housed anywhere from 12,000 to 18,000 residents in its prime, is divided into three distinct architectural groups known as the Hill Complex, the Valley Complex, and the Great Enclosure. The Great Enclosure bears the distinction of being the largest sub-Saharan prehistoric structure and boasts an 800-foot-long outer wall. These walls, which reach heights of 32 feet, were constructed entirely without the use of mortar; the granite used in the walls’ construction was split into blocks that fit together evenly and did not require the use of any kind of binding substance. Great Zimbabwe was once believed to be a hub of international trade, and artifacts recovered from the site were brought from as far away as China. Indigenous artifacts include eight large Zimbabwe birds carved from soapstone, which were believed to originally stand in the Eastern Enclosure of the Hill Complex. Though the identity of the city’s builders is no longer debated, many questions remain. The site, though well-positioned for trade, was not suited for the large-scale farming necessary to support the city’s population, and it is speculated that the depletion of natural resources played a role in its eventual abandonment. Despite researchers’ best guesses, however, the motivation behind the city’s initial construction and its later abandonment by the original inhabitants remains a mystery. The purpose of some of the city’s more prominent structures, such as the Conical Tower, also remains unknown.","The site is approximately half an hour from Masvingo by road. Access is possible via local minibus, as well as scheduled and chartered bus services. Masvingo is approximately five hours from Harare and three from Bulawayo."
42,Chinhoyi Caves,"Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe",The stunningly blue waters of these beautiful caves also have a violent past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chinhoyi-caves,"Chinhoyi Caves National Park is a hidden gem not far from Zimbabwe’s capital Harare. Visitors to the park will find stunningly blue pools inside preserved limestone and dolomite caves. Inside the caves, the air becomes cool and damp and silence descends as one walks down to the water. Holes in the roof of the cave usher in sunlight that illuminates its depths. One of the best parts of visiting the caves is that you’re likely to have them to yourself to enjoy in subterranean silence. What visitors can see is only the tip of the iceberg. The caves continue incredibly far underground in a complex limestone formation. The water is so clear and constant in temperature that scuba teams have descended to depths of more than 300 feet (100 meters). They have discovered subterranean passages linking the various pools. How deep these caves venture is still a mystery. Although serene, there is a bit of violent history surrounding the caves. In the early 1800s, as the story goes, an aggressive tribe swept into the region and murdered many local people. Their bodies were then tossed into the cave. The traditional name of the caves, Chirorodziva or “Pool of the Fallen” commemorates this event.","Camping is possible in the small national park, but if you are a day visitor, note that you will only be allowed in during daylight hours (about 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). The entrance fee was about 8 U.S. dollars in 2018. Going to the deepest part of each cave is highly recommended, as each has a different feel."
43,Balancing Rocks of the Zimbabwe Dollar,"Harare, Zimbabwe","These naturally balancing rocks were pictured on every Zimbabwean banknote, up to the 100 trillion-dollar note.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balancing-rocks-of-the-zimbabwe-dollar,"These three balancing rocks were once the main design motif of one of the highest of the high denomination currencies in the world, the Zimbabwean dollar. Every note issued by Zimbabwe’s Central Bank—from the one-dollar note issued after independence in 1980 to the 100 trillion-dollar banknote (100,000,000,000,000) issued in the hyper-inflationary zenith of 2008, has pictured these three stones. The image of the stones was chosen as a conjoined metaphor for development and environmental protection following the country’s independence from white-ruled Rhodesia. The rocks themselves can be found in a national park with an abandoned feel in Epworth, a suburb in the thinly signposted outskirts of Harare. The stones pictured on the banknotes are the most iconic example of this peculiar geological feature found in many places throughout Zimbabwe: rocks formations naturally situated in perfect balance. Matopos itself is well worth seeking out. Once inside, visitors can either walk or drive around the Stone Age rock formations with evocative names like the “Giant’s Playground” and “Flying Boat.” Even rocks with no honorific convey a silent magnitude. Outside the park, some enterprising residents have built their homes among the giant boulders that pock all of Epworth. The Zimbabwean dollar, however, is no more. The government effectively abandoned its currency and was de-monetised entirely in 2015. Now, the notes can be found on eBay, on the back of playing cards, in the hands of hawkers trying to sell the dead currency to tourists visiting Zimbabwe, or as props for cautionary tales of the dangers of runaway inflation, devaluations, and mercurial government economic policy. Nowadays, Zimbabwe has a multi-currency system. Money from almost every continent in the world is legal tender: the Aussie dollar, the British pound, the Botswanan pula, the Chinese Yuan, the Euro, the Indian Rupee, the Japanese yen, the South African rand. However, the most predominant note in circulation is the U.S. dollar in which prices are quoted in shops, restaurants, and, yes, even parks housing the iconic balancing stones. “Bond coins” of 1,2,5,10, 25 and 50 cent dominations are given out as small change. But the stones are making a making a comeback in the newest type of money in Zimbabwe’s bountiful currency basket. Last year, the Zimbabwean government introduced a “bond note” that is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is illustrated with those same rocks from the old Zimbabwean dollar. Only a 2 dollar bond note is in circulation currently, but the government plans to incrementally introduce 5, 10, 20 and 50 dollar values over the next few months. Having a local currency bound to another is unusual, but by no means unique. Bosnia-Herzegovina has convertible mark tied originally to the German Deutschmark and now to the euro. For 50 or so years, there was de facto parity between the pounds of Ireland and the United Kingdom. But there remains apprehensiveness among many Zimbabweans who remember the old Zimbabwe dollar days. They live in hope that their new money will be as solid, stable, and unwavering as these three majestic rocks themselves.",Private car or a knowledgable taxi driver is the best way to get there.
44,Daramombe Rock Paintings,"Chivhu, Zimbabwe",Several ancient rock paintings can be found on the hills surrounding the Daramombe High School.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/daramombe-rock-paintings,"Next to the big Daramombe Hill (where according to the local customs you can not complain or you will get lost), you can find different small hills consisting out of different sized boulders. Such hills also go by the name of kopjes. The rock paintings are scattered around the kopjes, some are very clear and big while others are small and slowly fading away. You can also encounter a graveyard of the first missionaries who build the school in 1939. The school as well as the big Anglican church was destroyed during the liberation war of Zimbabwe in 1970 but has been restored. The Anglican church still has its original walls, only the roof had to be completely restored. There are a lot of rock paintings that can be found at the different kopjes, some include a clear elephant, African drums, hunters, and many animals. No official research has ever been done to get to know more about the different rock paintings, so very little is known about them.","Upon arrival knock on the door of the school's headmaster to ask permission to enter, with a bit of luck, he will send someone with you that already knows the location of several of the rock paintings."
45,Blood Falls,Antarctica,Natural time capsule containing an alien ecosystem.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blood-falls,"This five-story, blood-red waterfall pours very slowly out of the Taylor Glacier in Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys. When geologists first discovered the frozen waterfall in 1911, they thought the red color came from algae, but its true nature turned out to be much more spectacular. Roughly two million years ago, the Taylor Glacier sealed beneath it a small body of water which contained an ancient community of microbes. Trapped below a thick layer of ice, they have remained there ever since, isolated inside a natural time capsule. Evolving independently of the rest of the living world, these microbes exist in a place with no light or free oxygen and little heat, and are essentially the definition of “primordial ooze.” The trapped lake has very high salinity and is rich in iron, which gives the waterfall its red color. A fissure in the glacier allows the subglacial lake to flow out, forming the falls without contaminating the ecosystem within. The existence of the Blood Falls ecosystem shows that life can exist in the most extreme conditions on Earth. Though tempting to make the connection, it does not prove, however, that life could exist on other planets with similar environments and similar bodies of frozen water—notably Mars and Jupiter’s moon Europa—as such life would have to arise from a completely different chain of events. Even if it doesn’t confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life, Antarctica’s Blood Falls is a wonder to behold both visually and scientifically.","The Dry Valleys are only accessible by helicopter from McMurdo Station (U.S.), Scott Base (New Zealand) or a cruise ship in the Ross Sea."
46,Deception Island,Antarctica,"An abandoned whaling station on an active volcano offers hot springs in Antarctica, surrounded by ruined giants of industry.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/deception-island-2,"Deception Island has been covered and then deserted by many, and the dilapidated shells of buildings, boats, and whaling equipment remain as proof of its productive years as a Norwegian-Chilean whaling station as well as the home of several scientific stations run by Chile, Argentina, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The thing is, building and operating expensive equipment on an active volcano is risky business, even if the area is considered one of the safest harbors on the continent due to its large caldera, a famous refuge from storms and icebergs. While several countries were bickering over sovereign flags and attempting to occupy the lusted-after real estate in the 1960s, the island had apparently had enough and kicked everyone off. Erupting twice in two years, it demolished research centers and buried everything left behind in ash, including a cemetery occupied by 45 deceased whalers and a long-deserted aircraft hangar. The island’s use is now administered under the Antarctic Treaty System, and it is now a popular tourist attraction as well as a scientific outpost. The giant iron boilers and tanks of the long-gone whalers still stand, large holes cut in their sides as a deterrent to the Nazis, who were feared to have been planning to use them to store fuel. Chinstrap penguins roam around everywhere, as the west side is home to one of the world’s largest chinstrap rookeries. One of the more unusual things to indulge in while visiting the island is to take advantage of the natural hot springs. Due to its geological temperament, Deception Island has a number of microclimates, which means if you can get past the biting, freezing Antarctic winds and into a volcanic bath, you can enjoy this snowy martian landscape in your swimsuit.","Head south in an icebreaker ship - turn into opening in volcanic island; moor ship, take zodiac to shore"

The coin Verdansky was purchased with still resides in the site’s most interesting location: the Vernadsky Station Lounge, one of the southernmost bars in the world. During the station’s British ownership, some of the carpenters repurposed a shipment of wood, meant to provide the station with a new pier, and built the small bar in a close approximation of a traditional English pub. The interior contains rustic wooden beams and aging pictures of famous Antarctica explorers above the seats. When the station was taken over by Ukraine, the bar received a bit of a makeover reflecting the new Ukrainian patrons, who added Cyrillic flags and other tchotchkes. In addition to the cosmetic changes, the bar now also offers vodka, distilled on site, for the bargain price of three dollars. Should you crave watching wild penguins while sipping bathtub vodka, the bar at the Vernadsky Base is open to any intrepid explorers willing to make the trek to the bottom of the world.","There is also a bar at Scott base, for a total of three bars at McMurdo Station."
48,Mt. Erebus,Antarctica,Fire meets ice at the southernmost volcano on Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mt-erebus,"Erebus. It’s a good name for the volcano. In Greek myth, Erebus was the son of the god Chaos, and his mother was Gaia or Earth. Erebus was made of darkness and shadow, and he filled the corners of the world with his darkness. Currently, the most active volcano in Antarctica and the southernmost active volcano on Earth, the Mt. Erebus volcano features a 1,700-degree Fahrenheit lava lake, a swirling pool of magma that may be many miles deep: one of only five such lava lakes that exist in the world. While the inside of Mt. Erebus may be extremely hot, outside of it, one would quickly freeze to death in the Antarctic temperatures. Riddling the side of the snow-covered volcano are ice caves, carved out by the escaping volcanic gases. Because of the gas, the ice caves stay a consistent 32 degrees, making them a likely spot for undiscovered extremophiles. The volcanic gases heat their way through these ice caves and escape into the air to form enormous 60-foot chimneys of ice, or “fumaroles” with deadly volcanic gases pouring out from their tips. Discovered in 1841 by polar explorer Sir James Clark Ross, it was easy to identify Mt. Erebus as a volcano as it was erupting at the time. (Ross Island, which Mt. Erebus is on, is named after him as is the Ross Ice Shelf.) Later, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton would make the first ascent of Mt. Erebus between 1907-1909 on the Nimrod Expedition. One of the things that makes Erebus significant - and the reason it is the location of the Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory, or “MEVO” - is that Erebus is one of only a few consistently active volcanos in the world. Rather than lying dormant and then spectacularly erupting once every few hundred years, though it does that on occasion too, Mt. Erebus is always on, bubbling, releasing gas and flinging ten feet wide “volcanic bombs” - hunks of molten rock which sometimes explode on landing - through the air. For a vulcanologist, Mt. Erebus is a dangerous but dreamy research site. Mt. Erebus is also the site of a famous and tragic air disaster. An Air New Zealand DC-10 airliner on a sightseeing flight became lost in a whiteout and crashed into the side of the volcano on 28 November 1979, killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew. Famed explorer Sir Edmund Hillary was supposed to have been on board but canceled at the last moment. Debris from the crash is still visible on the volcano, despite an extensive recovery and clean up the mission. The unclaimed remains of the crash victims are entombed at a memorial at the Waikumete Cemetery in West Aukland, New Zealand where every year a wreath is laid in memory. The massive polygenetic stratovolcano spews out an average of 80 grams of gold a day, all of it dissolved in the volcanic gases.",
49,Antarctic Exploration Museum & Post Office,Antarctica,The best place to send your postcards home from Antarctica.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antarctic-exploration-museum-post-office,"Located on remote Goudier Island on the Antarctic Peninsula, a former British research base now operates as a modest museum, gift shop, and post office. The buildings first served as the base for the WWII “Operation Tabarin” in 1944, a British military mission to monitor enemy activities in the extreme south following Germany’s airdrop of swastika-decorated leaflets across Queen Maud Land. Researchers worked out of the base until 1962. They then sat abandoned from that time until restorations in 1996 under terms of the Antarctic Treaty, which declared the buildings Historic Monuments and required that they be renovated. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) undertook the restoration and then opened the site up to visitors during the Antarctic summer. Port Lockroy was first discovered in 1903 by Jean-Baptiste Charcot’s French Antarctic Expedition and was named for one of the expedition’s backers. Of the six British Historic Monuments on the peninsula (Damoy, Detaille Island, Horseshoe Island, Port Lockroy, Stonington Island, and Wordie House), Port Lockroy is the only one fully restored. Most of the current research revolves around the local gentoo penguin population and observing the impact of humans on their environment.

50,The Ceremonial South Pole,Antarctica,Naked scientists race around the pole in the frigid cold to try to join Antarctica's exclusive 300 Club.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ceremonial-south-pole-antarctica,"Membership to one of the most exclusive clubs in the world takes place around a short red and white striped pole in Antarctica. Only those who endure an atmospheric difference of 300 degrees Fahrenheit are granted entry. To join the elite 300 Club, residents at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, where on winter days the outside temperature dips below -100 degrees, must bare it all. It’s an odd tradition, one that comes with a high risk of frostbite in rather sensitive, traditionally clothed areas. To join the exclusive group, the scientists must first spend time in the station’s 200-degree sauna. Once they’re fully cooked, they dash outside (at a brisk walk, because running is dangerous) wearing nothing but shoes and an optional neck gaiter to circle the ceremonial South Pole marker, which is hundreds of feet from the station. They then get back into the steamy sauna, which helps thaw their outsides while a bit of alcohol warms them up inside. Those who complete the challenge even earn a commemorative patch. Though the thought of a naked scientist racing across the ice in dangerously cold temperatures to circle a pole may seem simply absurd, it’s actually a beloved ritual. The temperature only gets low enough a handful of days each year, giving the wacky tradition an almost ceremonial feel. Participants are usually cheered on by bystanders who use flashlights to guide them to the pole during the perpetual winter blackness. The marker isn’t even the true location of the South Pole. Antarctica is blanketed by massive chunks of moving ice sheets that move about 30 feet each year. The ice’s inability to sit still makes pinpointing the world’s most southern spot with permanent precision impossible. Finding and marking the accurate geographic South Pole is an annual (fully clothed) New Year’s Day tradition for those staying at the station. Every year since 1959, South Pole residents erect a new temporary marker at the spot and retire the old one into a display case inside the station. The ceremonial South Pole remains where it is, flanked by the flags, awaiting the next group of winter scientists hoping to join one of the world’s weirdest clubs.",
51,IceCube Research Station,Antarctica,The world's largest neutrino telescope searches for secrets of the universe at the South Pole.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/icecube-research-station,"When your grade-school science teacher described the various methods one can use to construct a telescope, drilling countless holes a mile and a half deep into Antarctic ice probably wasn’t one of them. But that’s exactly how the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory works. Call it a telescope, call it a detector, or call it an observatory—it’s all the same to the University of Wisconsin  scientists at the IceCube, which is now the world’s largest neutrino research array. Constructed between 2005 and 2010, the IceCube array consists of 86 identical holes, drilled 1.5 miles deep, scattered throughout the ice and filled with extremely sensitive particle physics monitoring equipment. The IceCube is a tangential facility of the much larger Amundson-Scott South Pole Station, both of which are literally located at the South Pole in Antarctica, where temperatures are normally a deadly -75 degrees Fahrenheit. The research being done at the IceCube is obscure and esoteric, as they essentially search for signs of tiny subatomic particles called neutrinos as they streak through the crystal clear ice thousands of feet below the surface, but its impact could be profound. Neutrinos are one of the most mysterious building blocks of the universe, and while studying them is notoriously difficult, the more scientists understand about their behavior, the more they will be able to explain how the universe works. More heralded and easily understood than the science of the lab is remarkable engineering it took to create it. Beyond the extreme difficulties of travel and habitation at the South Pole, the drilling of the all-important holes used for the array’s sensors is an engineering marvel. Using highly advanced equipment, scientists bored into the earth with an ultra-high-pressure hot water drill, not unlike a massive power washer. Each tube took approximately 40 hours to drill in total. Antarctica seems like a long way to go to measure one tiny particle, but the darkness and purity of the subsurface ice at the South Pole creates a naturally ideal environment for detecting neutrinos, which almost never actually interact with matter, making them very hard to measure. In fact, it is only when one accidentally collides with another particle and creates a reaction that its presence can be examined, and that is difficult to create in a lab environment – it’s more likely to be seen by happenstance over a large area, such as the gigantic IceCube array, which might be the most artful application of a using desolate location for the advancement of science to date.",
52,Trinity Church on King George Island,Antarctica,Russian Orthodox church built on an Antarctic island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trinity-church-on-king-george-island,"From the scorching deserts of Sinai to the frozen tundras of Siberia, Orthodox Christianity has a history of building its churches and monasteries in inhospitable places. But only a few can rival Trinity Church on King George Island. The southernmost Orthodox church in the world, Trinity was built near Bellingshausen Station, Russia’s permanent outpost in Antarctica. In the mid-1990s, Patriarch Alexius II of Moscow gave his blessing for this audacious project. The church was constructed in Russia and transported by a supply ship to its present location. One or two monks from Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, considered the most important Russian monastery as it is the spiritual center of the Russian Orthodox Church, volunteer to man the church year-round. While most of the buildings on this continent are built to hug the ground in order to reduce their exposure to the polar wind, this church proudly stands 15 meters tall. It is a wooden structure constructed from Siberian pine and carved in the traditional Russian style by master carpenters of Altay. The priests manning the church take care of the spiritual needs of the staff of nearby Russian, Chilean, Polish, and Korean research stations. Their obligations include praying for the souls of 64 Russians who lost their lives in various expeditions, and the very occasional, very chilly, baptism. The church is large enough to accommodate 30 visitors, but it is rarely filled to capacity. Recently, however, the church performed its first wedding — the first wedding ever celebrated in a church in Antarctica — between Chilean and Russian researchers.","Several tourist agencies organize charter flights from Punta Arenas, Chile, or Ushuaia, Argentina, to King George Island."
53,Leningradskaya,Antarctica,This abandoned Antarctic research station is a Soviet ghost frozen in time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leningradskaya-2,"Perched on a rocky outcropping in the Victoria Land region of Antarctica is the abandoned Soviet research station Leningradskaya, and while it has not been in use for decades, it still sits there like a ghost from the USSR. Built in 1971, the Leningradskaya station was created by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition as a year-long research base that could facilitate their studies. The base stayed in operation for a full 20 years, allowing the Russian science teams to study everything from meteorology to magnetism to oceanology. During its tenure, the base, which sits atop a tall cliff, was assailed by extreme winds and storms that made base life a harrowing affair. Finally, in 1991, the station was evacuated after the Soviet Union fell and funding for the base was discontinued. In the time since the base was abandoned, the various huts have simply sat vacant, collecting ice. Most of the old huts were left just as they were with supplies and equipment intact, the idea being that one day, researchers might return and pick up where they left off. Most of the huts are squat square buildings that look a bit unremarkable and rusty, although one of the buildings does feature a minaret-like globe perched on the roof. Over the years, the newly christened Russian Antarctic Expedition has discussed intentions to reopen the base, but nothing has ever materialized. Russia has sent icebreakers to the site which may signal some renewed interest in reopening the base, but as of yet, nothing has happened.",
54,Point Nemo,Antarctica,"At the point of oceanic inaccessibility, you can't get farther from dry land without leaving the planet.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/point-nemo,"Sometimes you just wish you could get the hell away from everyone and everything, and there may be no more effective spot to do so on the entire planet than Point Nemo, the spot that is farther from a landmass than any other spot in the seas. Technically, the spot, which is located far out into the Pacific Ocean, is known as the “Oceanic Point of Inaccessibility.” Its nickname is taken from the Jules Verne character Captain Nemo, a Latin name which itself translates to “no one.” The far-flung oceanic spot can be found over 1,450 nautical miles from the nearest landfall, which is one of three spots. Since the Earth is spherical, deciding on the most remote oceanic location required three equidistant points of measurement. They are Ducie Island, which is itself a barren and incredibly remote atoll belonging to the Pitcairn Island chain; the rocky Motu Nui of Chile; and Antarctica’s Maher Island, which is so small and remote it wasn’t even discovered until the 1940s. Point Nemo was first discovered in 1992 thanks to the use of geotargeting software. There are no commercial ways to access the most remote point in the ocean, and with good reason. There is nothing there. No beacon or anchored marker. Just vast expanses of open ocean. The only thing a visitor will find at Point Nemo is the honor of being harder to reach than just about anyone else on the planet.",
55,Pegasus Wreck,Antarctica,"The remains of a doomed Antarctic plane, buried beneath layers of ice and snow, await those willing to do a bit of digging.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pegasus-wreck,"On October 8, 1970, the pilots of the Pegasus, a C-121 Lockheed Constellation plane, knew they had a problem. A fierce storm was ravaging the air above Antarctica. But they were forced to fly onward, a lack of fuel making it impossible for them to boomerang back to New Zealand. A slurry of snow and ice whipped through the air, erasing any and all visibility. The wind caused the aircraft to thrash around and beat the plane so hard it ripped off pieces of its exterior. Soon, the Pegasus was dropping toward the frozen desert below. It crashed atop the ground and skid along the ice before finally drawing to a halt. Miraculously, the 80 people aboard the plane survived the crash with no major injuries. They were all rescued and able to carry on with their Antarctic research largely unharmed, though likely a bit rattled. Now, anyone who happens to find themselves near the McMurdo Station can try to take a trip to the crash site. The Pegasus is still there, resting beneath a blanket of snow. Most of the plane is usually covered by layers of ice and snow, though people do like to unbury it to take photographs or carve their names onto its exterior. The crash even inspired researchers to rename the ice runway and airfield after the wrecked aircraft. However, Pegasus Field closed in December of 2014 because of excess summer melt.",
56,McMurdo Station,"McMurdo Station, Antarctica","Antarctica's bustling metropolis, originally established by Richard E. Byrd.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mcmurdo-station,"Located on volcanic rock marking the southernmost solid ground accessible by ship, McMurdo Station is the gateway of most all scientific, private, and touristic jaunts into the Antarctic. During the interminably sunny summer months, McMurdo’s population booms to over a thousand, comprised of scientists from both private and public spheres, supported by a whole cadre of seemingly-average Joes who keep the mini-city bustling. Grocers procure international comfort food, carpenters, and construction workers maintain the place, bus drivers transport passengers and goods via the infamous “Ivan the Terra Bus,” gardeners tend greenhouses - and everyone eats soft-serve ice cream from McMurdo’s cafeteria. One thing is for certain, individuals who choose to call McMurdo home, even for part of the year, can be as unusual as the climate at their doorsteps. Werner Herzog’s 2007 documentary “Encounters at the End of the World” admirably and lovingly demonstrated this point. And of course, when secluded in such extreme conditions, outlets for personal entertainment are of utmost import: a curling rink recently replaced the station’s bowling alley, there’s a weekly news publication, cable television, and personal Internet access to keep everyone sane. Though officially “founded” in 1956 as a base for scientists venturing to the south pole and other remote research facilities scattered about the continent, just a stone’s throw from modern-day McMurdo lies the spot on Hut Point marked by said-hut which was left stocked with provisions in 1904 by Robert F. Scott on his polar expedition. Thanks to the hut’s frigid (but dry!) climate and generally low-traffic location, the original pantry, laboratory and sleeping quarters of the men remain pristine and virtually untouched from their original condition. There are even the remains of seal butchered by the expedition for food. The hut is basically a time capsule of early Antarctic exploration. Obscura Day location: April 9, 2011.","Access to McMurdo station is extremely limited outside of approved scientific purposes, your best bet is to volunteer for an internship or apply for a position in the base support staff (fire department, galley staff, etc).

57,Shackleton's Antarctic Hut,Antarctica,"Nimrod Polar Expedition base, and home to hundred-year-old frozen whisky.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shackleton-s-antarctic-hut,"Ernest Shackleton’s stash of hundred-year-old booze was discovered buried in the ice under the explorer’s Antarctic base camp. In January 2010 workers from the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust successfully extracted the cases from the ice and now one of them is being slowly thawed to see if the whisky can be saved. The hut served as the base of operations for the British 1907-1909 Nimrod Expedition, an early attempt in the race to the geographic South Pole led by a young Ernest Shackleton. The expedition set out from McMurdo Sound. Shackleton had taken part in Robert Scott’s earlier Discovery Expedition, from which he was sent home, most likely suffering from scurvy. It had originally been his plan to launch his expedition from Scott’s Discovery Hut on Hut Point, but after being specifically asked not to do so, Shackleton’s crew erected their own pre-fabricated hut at Cape Royds, just 23 miles from the original structure. The simple structure is 33 feet long by 19 feet wide, with separate lodging for the expedition’s ponies, dogs, and the first motorcar on the continent, a 12-15 horsepower Arrol Johnston specially retrofitted for the expedition. The expedition was plagued by the types of problems that would become the familiar hallmarks of polar exploration. An early sidetrip nearly killed six members of the expedition on the first ascent of Mt. Erebus which left them trapped on the side of the volcano in blizzard conditions. Later, the first attempt on the pole broke down in personality conflicts and equipment failures and was forced to turn back within 100 miles of the goal. Inadequate food supplies and the death of the expedition’s ponies on the return trip led Shackleton to complain, “We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow.” Some success was achieved by the separate northern expedition party who made it to the magnetic South Pole (a moving target, several miles from the geographic South Pole), which was enough to consider the overall effort a success. Upon leaving Antarctica to go back home, Shackleton wrote: “We all turned out to give three cheers and to take a last look at the place where we had spent so many happy days. The hut was not exactly a palatial residence … but, on the other hand, it had been our home for a year that would always live in our memories…. We watched the little hut fade away in the distance with feelings almost of sadness, and there were few men aboard who did not cherish a hope that some day they would once more live strenuous days under the shadow of mighty Erebus.” Shackleton was knighted upon his return to England. Five years later he made his most famous attempt at the pole. The Endurance Expedition, in which his ship became trapped and sunk in ice, was another technical failure, but an epic success story of survival against all odds. The Cape Royds Hut was restored between 2004 and 2008 as part of the Ross Sea Heritage Restoration Project, which is looking after the four Antarctic expedition huts. The building has been left almost exactly as it was at the turn of the last century. Workers hoped to uncover two crates of whisky rumored to be located at the hut, but were surprised to find five crates of whisky and brandy, intact and full, in 2006. They were carefully removed from the ice four years later. One crate of the whiskey has been carefully exported to New Zealand, where conservators are attempting to slowly thaw the bottles. The company Whyte and Mackay, the original supplier of the whisky is still in business, and now involved with the Canterbury Museum in New Zealand, where they are attempting to safely thaw some of the whisky so that a sample can be taken, and, hopefully, a recipe re-created. Once the experiment is completed, the crate will be returned to its home at the hut. You can follow the whisky thaw project here: The Great Whisky Crate Thaw.",

Everything you’d expect from a typical tiny Chilean village—except this Chilean village is not in Chile, not even close. Spanish for “Stars Town”, Villa Las Estrellas is a civilian settlement located in the unforgiving terrain of Antarctica, only one of two on the entire continent. Larger than its fellow colony Esperanza Base, Villa Las Estrellas has a population of just over 100 during the summer and even less once the winter winds begin to blow. Despite the brutal landscape and isolated location, the settlement does enjoy a tourist season and offers snowmobile and ski expeditions as well as chance to catch a peek at all of the wonderful South Pole creatures from Emperor penguins to Killer whales. Nearby Bellingshausen offers opportunities to learn about polar auroras and glaciology. The town has a radio station, TV reception, and yes, even internet access, although it’s reserved for the school’s three computers.

59,Erebus Ice Tongue Caves,"McMurdo Station, Antarctica",Southern Ocean waters and glacial forces transform the Antarctic ice into these stunning bridges and caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erebus-ice-tongue-caves,"Living in Antarctica? Tired of the ice-core-collecting grind? Then head on over to the Erebus Ice Tongue, where you can see some of the most spectacular ice formations on Earth. An ice tongue is a unique glacial formation created by an ice stream that flows faster than the surrounding ice and thus pushes out to sea ahead of the glacier’s edge. Moreover, this activity needs to take place in a protected harbor so that the ice tongue remains intact, rather than being broken up by strong currents or collisions with icebergs. It’s a fairly specific formula, and it can be found on the west coast of Ross Island, where Mt. Erebus — the world’s southernmost active volcano — feeds a valley glacier that flows ahead of the surrounding ice into a protected portion of McMurdo Sound. The resulting Erebus Ice Tongue is a slender peninsula protruding 11 kilometers from the coastline, where waves, tidal activity and internal stresses carve the glacier into these stunning ice caves. The strange serrated bird’s-eye appearance of the ice tongue gives some hint about the intricacy of the forces at work. Small holes on the surface of the ice open up into soaring, majestic spaces within the glacier’s interior. The flowing shapes and elaborate features — including “ice stalactites”, hanging ice bridges, and intricate, unusually large crystalline structures — are illuminated by a diffuse blue light filtering in from the cold Antarctic sun. The caves are a popular attraction for the residents of nearby research bases McMurdo Station and Scott Base, who come to marvel at the cold, quiet beauty of the place. Additionally, Weddell seals have been observed visiting the underwater caves of Erebus Ice Tongue — less to take pictures, more to avoid getting devoured by orcas and leopard seals. When visiting, humans are asked to please not pee in the ice caves; seals, being beyond the reach of human rules, can do whatever they like.","Located inside the Erebus Ice Tongue, the ice caves are a protected place and can only be visited from McMurdo Station when accompanied by US Antarctic Program mountaineers. Getting there requires travel across the sea ice from McMurdo, so the site is only accessible for brief periods each year."

Located at the furthest point from the Southern Ocean, the Pole has a year round average temperature of -58.2°C (-72°F). Due to its remoteness - the South Pole is 878 km away and the nearest city, Cape Town in South Africa, is 5631 km distant - the Pole doesn’t see visitors very often. A Soviet expedition led by Yevgeny Tolstikov reached the Pole of Inaccessibility for the first time in 1958. The group left a small research base, also called Pole of Inaccessibility, topped off with a bust of Vladimir Lenin that faces Moscow. The station was in operation from December 14th to 26th, 1958. Since then, at least two more expeditions have reached the Pole. An American expedition arrived in 1965 and in 2007 a British/Canadian expedition became the first to arrive on foot, where they discovered the research station completely covered in snow. Therefore, they were unable to get inside the building to sign the golden visitors’ book that the Soviets had left nearly fifty years before.","Antarctica, 878 km from the South Pole."

Ice and snow-free due to unique conditions, these valleys have intrigued researchers as the landscape on Earth that’s as close to Mars as we can currently get. With 98% of its surface being covered in a mile-deep sheet of ice, Antarctica is the epitome of an unforgiving environment. Life is a rare occurrence in this severe climate, which is considered the driest, coldest, and windiest desert on planet Earth - but life has been found, in the most unlikely of places, and that unlikely place is the alien terrain of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Despite having no actual human population to speak of and only a smattering of wildlife, Antarctica is not a hopelessly barren wasteland. Between 1,000 to 5,000 people, mostly researchers and scientists, brave the hostile continent every year, inhabiting the unique “town” of McMurdo Station. From this central hub, researchers have made groundbreaking discoveries in and around the valleys. From water samples of Blood Falls revealing microbes with metabolic processes never before witnessed to bacteria hiding from the dry winds in the interior of rocks, the valleys have changed our notion of what it takes to sustain life. While life does indeed thrive in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, don’t mistake them for a gentle oasis on the tundra. The lack of snow is not a sign of softness, but the result of 200 mph katabatic winds sucked down into the valleys by gravity and heating up as they pound toward the ground, evaporating any moisture in their wake. The mountains surrounding are high enough to prevent the ice sheet from covering the area, leaving naked, unyielding bedrock, scattered with loose gravel and the occasional ice wedge. This terrain full of mystery and surprises truly represents the tenacity of life and the possibility that it extends beyond the barriers we’ve assigned it.","As there are no roads of note best to use your much more reliable GPS - 77° 28′ 0″ S, 162° 31′ 0″ E.

Founded as a small research base at the South Pole in 1956, Amundsen-Scott Station has developed into a thriving research hub sometimes housing hundreds of science and support personnel at a time. What originally began as a cluster of wooden buildings has progressed into a state-of-the-art network of facilities designed to support scientific operations while mitigating the effects of the harsh Antarctic environment on its inhabitants. What many do not know, however, is that beneath the expanse of high-tech buildings, communications facilities, and even an airport complete with an ice runway, there lies a complex web of tunnels carved out of the ice itself. Completed in 2002, these tunnels were created to convey fresh water and effluent to and from the new “elevated station” buildings. Since that time, adventurous station personnel have descended into the tunnels (the temperature of which hovers just below -60°F/-51°C) to create personal memorials to a wide array of Antarctic experiences. Some of these shrines commemorate specific Antarctic seasons or completed work projects, and some are just silly. One of the strangest of these monuments consists of the body of an atrophied White Sturgeon and a handwritten account of its journey. The fish had arrived in 1992 at McMurdo Station (a US base located at the edge of Antarctica and the Ross Sea) and had been destined for a remote Russian station called Vostok. However, the Russians gifted the sturgeon to American scientists who later discarded it after it had languished uneaten in a freezer for several months. It was from the trash dump that a garbage processing crew reclaimed the sturgeon, and it then made its way from location to location across Antarctica. It finally became enshrined in the tunnels beneath the South Pole where it greets visitors from a ledge chiseled in the ice.","With permission from COMMS, go to the bottom of the ""beer can"" that is attached to the elevated station and head down the tunnel towards the fuel arch. The tunnels are the on the right."

Since then it has sat abandoned, but not neglected. The small base was first established by the BAS in 1956. Consisting of one long building and a pair of smaller outer structures, like a dog pen, the outpost was small, but the interests of its researchers were varied, ranging from conducting meteorological studies to gathering geological data to simply mapping the area. In theory, the team would travel by dogsled across the frozen sea ice between the island and the Antarctic mainland where they would conduct their tests, but it was not long before this proved to be an issue as the ice around the island was unstable and dangerous to traverse. In fact, Base W was only in use for two short years before it had to be abandoned. In the winter of 1958, the yearly freeze blocked the team’s supply vessel from reaching them. A pair of American icebreakers even came to help, but it was no use. Thus the decision was made to cut their losses and vacate the base before things got any worse. The entire team packed up their essential gear, locked down the huts, and trekked across 25 miles of treacherous sea ice to reach the waiting ship. The base was officially abandoned in 1959, but its story was not yet over. Members of the BAS returned to Base W in the 1996/97 season to find that the site had become a perfectly preserved snapshot of 1950s Antarctic life. The old Hoover washer was still there along with all the old log books, leftover supplies, and other everyday items that had to be left behind in the scramble to the boat. Leaving everything in place, they cleaned and winterized the site before returning home. In 2009 the base was officially named a historic landmark that is now kept up by the BAS, and while there is no one in permanent residence, anyone who manages to make the trip is free to explore the old base so long as they don’t disturb the historic site. The doors are left unlocked and there is even a guest book and a little cleaning kit, to both make your mark on the site and erase it.

64,Discovery Hut,"McMurdo Station, Antarctica",Wooden hut from the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/discovery-hut,"The time between 1897 and 1922 is known as the Heroic Age of Polar Exploration, a time when both northern and southern polar regions of the globe were visited by humans for the first time. The United Kingdom, the superpower of the age, envisioned itself as the natural leader in this endeavor. The Discovery Hut stands as a monument to one of their less successful endeavors. This humble wooden building was erected in 1902 at Hut Point on Ross Island near McMurdo Sound in Antarctica. The British, who had charged its best scientific minds with the task of designing a habitat and storage facility suitable for Antarctic climatic conditions, intended to use the base for the Discovery Expedition lead by Sir Robert Falcon Scott. Unfortunately, the best minds of Britain had never set foot in Canada or Scandinavia, much less the Antarctic. As an Antarctic habitat, the Discovery Hut proved to be an utter failure. The hut was prefabricated in Australia at a cost of £360 and transported in pieces by ship to be assembled on the spot. A square structure, it had useless verandas on the three sides, which served only as snow traps. The insulation provided by a relatively thin layer of felt stuck between two layers of wooden planks turned out to be extremely insufficient. The hut was unbearably cold and windy, so much so that the crew refused to use it and continued sleeping on the ship. The pyramidal roof was not slanted enough to permit the sliding off of snow, but at least it made the profile of the building low enough to avoid the most brutal whips of wind. However, this too proved useless as the hut was oriented with the entrance on the windward southern side. The hut was visited again by Ernest Shackleton’s expedition in February 1908. Shackleton found the main door ripped off the hinges by a gust of wind and the entrance blocked completely by accumulated snow. Shackleton’s men had to enter the building via the window on the leeward side. The lessons learned from Discovery Hut’s inadequacies were used in the design of the base for Terra Nova expedition, Scott’s next attempt to reach the South Pole. However, this was not enough to save the lives of Scott and his crew in this ill-fated effort. Some of the provisions left by expeditions of the early 1900s are still present in the hut. A few of the items are in relatively good condition thanks to constant subzero temperatures. The century-old seal blubber hanging in the hut, though, has turned rancid.",

Who better to get some tips from than the oldest living animal: the volcano sponge Anoxycalyx joubini, found off the McMurdo shelf in Antarctica, thought to be nearly 15,000 years old. The sponge’s secret? Living in extremely cold conditions deep under the ocean. This type of volcano sponge is one of the largest and can be up to 6.5 feet in height and 4.5 feet in diameter. It is also one of the most difficult to study and understand, given that it can be found at a depth of anywhere between 49 and 472 feet. A lot of what is known about this organism is based on early studies conducted in the McMurdo Sound region. It was named after  Louis Joubin, a professor at France’s National Museum of Natural History in Paris. The pear-shaped sponge is usually white or pale-yellow and its interiors are often home to a number of smaller creatures like amphipods, isopods, and polychaete worms. Research has found that the sponges grow at a minuscule rate, which is nearly unobservable. The extremity of the cold habitat slows down all biological processes, leading to increased longevity. Anoxycalyx Joubini didn’t survive nearly 15000 years without some attacks from predators, the most of common of which is the seastar Acodontaster conspicuus, which accumulate in bunches on the sponge and slowly kill it. The sponge and its characteristics are studied with the help of a SCINI ROV—a Submersible Capable of under Ice Navigation and Imaging Remotely Operated Vehicle.","The coordinates listed lead to the McMurdo research station, where studies of the sponge and other underwater fauna are carried out.

When they reached 3,623 meters (11,886 feet), they stopped because they couldn’t figure out why the ice at such an extreme depth was so clean. After a series of tests using radar and seismic waves, it turned out that this ice was actually the uppermost region of the world’s largest warm-water sub-glacial lake - a lake roughly the size of Lake Ontario. The lake is composed of fresh water and has been isolated beneath the glacier for somewhere between half a million and one million years. Naturally, the first thing that came to the scientists’ minds was that this lake could possibly be the most pristine liquid environment on Earth and could be full of living creatures and organisms that, due to isolation and adaptation, live nowhere else. Researchers tested the core samples taken close to the water and indeed found microbes that have never been found elsewhere. But when the question of how to explore the lake came up, not long after its discovery, the Vostok scientists faced a serious dilemma. The lake is under immense pressure, and to breach the ice would have devastating consequences. Secondly, anything sent into this pristine environment would have to be as sterile as possible to avoid contamination. In 1999, NASA approved funding for the development of a torpedo-like probe dubbed “Cryobot.” Equipped with a heated tip, the probe was designed to slowly melt its way down through the glacier, unwinding communication cables as it went. As Cryobot ventured down, the water would refreeze behind and above it. Then, before it breached the ceiling of the lake, the probe was to decontaminate itself with a hydrogen peroxide bath. Once inside, Cryobot would release the remote-controlled “Hydro boat,” a specially designed submersible vehicle equipped with a camera and other instruments, to explore the interior of the lake. Despite promising tests, funding for the project was cut in 2003. One hope, however, is that due to the discovery that Mars also has sub-glacial lakes and that Jupiter’s moon Europa may have them as well, the Cryobot project will be re-opened soon in order to test technology for future space missions. UPDATE: As of February 2012 Russian scientists report that they have successfully drilled to the surface of the lake and pierced the ice sheet, however, many in the scientific world are concerned about their method, which entails using kerosene to keep the borehole open. The fear is that only taking samples from the top of the lake will be insufficient for proper analysis, making the possible contamination a large risk with little benefit. The concern is that a mere surface sample will tell scientists nothing regarding the depth of the lake, or anything about the sediment, which could hold vital information, and that the kerosene could compromise the samples and skew data. Regardless, the lake has been reached, and the unconfirmed word is that there is a possibility of a “fundamental scientific development”. The Russian team is battling intense weather conditions, and communication is inconsistent and unpredictable, so the scientific community and the rest of the world can do nothing but wait until contact is reestablished to find out what, after 20 years of drilling, lies beneath the ice.",
68,Marie Byrd Land,Antarctica,The largest piece of no man's land left on Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marie-byrd-land,"While much of Antarctica has been claimed by various nations, this large swath of uninhabitable territory goes unspoken for. The snowy expanse of Marie Byrd Land is the largest no man’s land on Earth. This uninhabitable Antarctic tundra was named by an explorer for his wife, and because no one else has claimed it, the name stuck. The area was christened by Admiral Richard E. Byrd, who led the first exploratory flight over the area in 1929. He named the area after his wife, Marie. The previously unresearched region was so inhospitable the crew was unable to camp there, and instead set up on the neighboring Ross Ice Shelf. Little has changed in the years since Byrd’s exploration. Marie Byrd Land remains one of the harshest climates on the planet, so inaccessible and rough that no sovereign nation has laid claim to it. Some expeditions have forged further into the area, but the only way explorers have been able to map out Marie Byrd Land in the years since has been from the air. Aerial photography has revealed a great deal about the region. Although it borders Antarctica’s highest point, Vinson Massif mountain, Marie Byrd Land is mostly made up of the Bentley Subglacial Trench, the lowest point on the continent. While no nations are fighting over this antarctic tundra, one man has attempted to claim Marie Byrd Land for himself. Supposedly through a loophole in the Antarctic Treaty—the document that dictates international relations regarding Antarctica—Travis McHenry laid claim to the region, named it the Protectorate of Westarctic, and sent letters to various countries informing them of his claim. McHenry hoped to create his own currency for his micro-nation, but thus far none of the nations he contacted have replied to him and his claim goes unrecognized.",
69,Esperanza Base,Antarctica,The birthplace of the very first human resident born in Antarctica.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/esperanza-base,"This Argentinian colony made up of a mere 55 residents in the winter months is only one of two civilian settlements on the great white continent of Antarctica. Along with Villa las Estrellas, a Chilean colony with twice as many people, Esperanza is one of the rare examples of a community that chose to inhabit the desolate winds and snowy tundras down south—the other settlements are all military or scientific bases. A treaty established in 1959 bars member nations from establishing territorial claims, but both Esperanza and Villa Las Estrellas were established before the treaty, and therefore immune. Despite being a simple, civilian town that serves as home to only 10 families, Esperanza takes on an appearance similar to the serious military bases strewn about the snow. A smattering of bland, military-esque buildings (43 in all) are scattered around the settlement, no sign of outside activity seen, and with only one month out of the year delivering temperatures below freezing, none should be expected. It is here in Esperanza that Antarctica welcomed its very first official native in 1978, when a baby named Emilio Palma came into the cold, cold world—the son of a naval officer and his wife, Palma was the first human life to begin in a brutal corner of the world that has ended more than its share. A local cemetery houses the remains of several of the explorers who perished nearby. While considered a domestic community it still serves a research base, housing the facilities to support studies of limnology, glaciology, seismology, and oceanography, along with some of the more general sciences. To power these facilities, the colony burns through 4,800 US gallons of fuel per year.",
70,The Snow Tomb of Captain Robert Falcon Scott,Antarctica,The bodies of some early polar pioneers are still buried beneath the harsh snows of the Antarctic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-snow-tomb-of-captain-robert-falcon-scott-antarctica,"While Sir Ernest Shackleton is often heralded as the hero of polar exploration, he had many contemporaries, among them British naval captain Robert Falcon Scott, who along with four of his men is still buried under the snows of the Antarctic. In November 1912, on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica, the surviving members of Scott’s Terra Nova expedition were searching for their leader. Scott and his party had vanished into the snows the previous year - never returning from their quest for the South Pole. On November 12th, one of the group, physicist Charles Wright, saw “a small object projecting above the surface” of the snow. It was part of a tent. They had discovered the final resting place of Scott and two of his men, Henry “Birdie” Bowers and Edward Wilson. Scott lay between them, his diary recording their final days: “It seems a pity, but I do not think I can write more,” the last entry ran, “For God’s sake look after our people.” In his final starved, frostbitten days, Scott worried about the financial burden on the families he and his men had left behind. Edgar “Taff” Evans and Lawrence “Titus” Oates had died earlier on the return journey from the Pole, where the party of five had found to their dismay that they had been bested by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. Discouraged, they trudged back toward the coast, Evans dying on the descent of the Beardmore Glacier and Oates freezing to death on the Ross Ice Shelf. Oates, wounded and thus concerned he was a burden to the others, limped out of the tent into a blizzard on March 17th and was never seen again. But his noble suicide would not save Scott, Wilson, and Bowers, who by March 29th were all dead in the tent. They had died just 11 miles short of a food depot, but 11 miles in an Antarctic blizzard with -60˚ Celsius temperatures was close to an eternity. Why it was that Scott and his men perished has been debated ever since the discovery of their bodies, with most scholars pinning at least part of the blame on Scott’s decision-making, while others point to a series of random misfortunes, coupled with atrocious March weather. Only one other expedition had experienced similarly impossible conditions, a three-man team of Wilson, Bowers and Apsley Cherry-Garrard setting off in the Antarctic winter on a quest for Emperor penguin eggs. The three were extraordinarily lucky to have survived; Cherry-Garrard recalled his teeth chattering so violently that they shattered. The bodies of Scott and his men were not brought back to Britain. Instead, wrote Cherry-Garrard, who had been part of the search party, “We never moved them. We took the bamboos of the tent away and the tent itself covered them. Over them we built the cairn.” This cairn of snow, topped with a solitary cross, was all that marked the remote spot in the Antarctic emptiness which has not been seen for over 100 years. The grave site was quickly buried in drifting snow, while the tent and bodies have been migrating downward into the ice under the weight of accumulating snow and seaward with the ice shelf toward the Ross Sea. A more permanent monument to Scott and his men was erected on Observation Hill near McMurdo Station, but given time, it is likely that, encased deep within an iceberg, the bodies of Scott, Bowers, and Wilson will slowly drift away out to sea.",
71,Antarctic Sculpture Garden,"Davis Station, Antarctica","Antarctica's only sculpture garden, it has art and penguins, but no plants in sight.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antarctic-sculpture-garden,"Part of the Australian Antarctic Division, the Antarctic Sculpture Garden was built in the summer 2002-2003 season by Stephen Eastaugh using a grant from the Australian Antarctic Arts Fellowship. The inspiration for the garden was the oldest sculpture in the collection, “Man Sculpted by Antarctica,” known locally under the nickname “Fred the Head.” This work was sculpted by a plumber on the base named Hans in 1977, and thus pre-dates the sculpture garden. The artist’s intention is that the harsh local climate will continue the sculpting process. This outdoor venue gives aspiring artists a chance to exhibit their works on all of the continents.","On the grounds of the Davis Station, Antarctica."
72,Mawson's Huts,Antarctica,These abandoned huts still hold the remains of an early 20th century Australian researcher's work.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mawsons-huts,"Sitting on the edge of Cape Denison in Antarctica is a small group of huts that were built by Australian antarctic explorer Douglas Mawson in the early 20th century. However, they have been abandoned for decades, preserving much of the effects and decor of the original expedition. Constructed between 1911-1914, the small research station is now known simply as the Mawson Huts. It stands as one of the last outposts left from the so-called Heroic Era of Antarctic Exploration, and the only one created by Australians. Mawson and his team of 17 men, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, travelled to Commonwealth Bay to conduct experiments on a variety of subjects including continental drift, local wildlife, and glaciation. Given the harsh climate, life in the huts was miserable. Blizzards and hurricane force winds were the norm, and communication was difficult despite a radio relay that was set up on a nearby island. Mawson would later write of the experience, saying, “Temperatures as low as -28 degrees F. (60 degrees below freezing-point) were experienced in hurricane winds, which blew at a velocity occasionally exceeding one hundred miles per hour. Still, air and low temperatures, or high winds and moderate temperatures, are well enough; but the combination of high winds and low temperatures is difficult to bear.” When the expedition left the site, they left their huts in place and headed out. The site simply sat in the cold and wind for two decades. They were briefly used in the 1930s, then abandoned once again. A number of the huts succumbed to the harsh winter conditions, but the main hut and the adjoining magnetograph house are still intact, retaining some of the original equipment such as the iron stove. While reaching Mawson’s Huts is not exactly easy, they remain there for any enterprising explorer interested in paying a visit. They are a protected historic site, so if the weather doesn’t destroy them, they should be there for some time to come.",
73,Chapel of the Snows,"McMurdo Station, Antarctica","The place of worship erected not once, but three times in one of the most desolate places on Earth.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapel-of-the-snows,"Chapel of the Snows, not originally planned for McMurdo Station, was built as a non-denominational Christian church by the seasonal residents of the station, and is the southernmost religious building in the world. The desolate McMurdo Science Station, while home to a mere 200 humans during the winter months, can get up to a bustling population of 1,000 during Antarctica’s version of summer. A modest chapel that can hold up to 63 souls at a time, Chapel of Snows does its best to accommodate the spiritual needs of all who brave the brutal environment to work in one of the harshest science centers on earth. Holding regular Catholic and Protestant services, the chapel also provides a place for Buddhists, Latter Day Saints, and followers of Baha’i to meet, and serves as a gathering place for Alcoholics Anonymous. While designed to be a place of solace, the chapel has had its share of trials. In 1978, the church was devastated by a fire that started in the rear heater room, and despite the valiant efforts of the fire crew and volunteers throwing snow on the smoldering building, it was a total loss. Mourning the loss of historic memorabilia from winter crews past, but counting their blessings that no one was injured, volunteers pulled together scrap materials and built a temporary replacement. A refurbishing of McMurdo Station was planned by the National Science Foundation, and a new chapel was included in the design. The new, 2,016-square-ft structure was dedicated in March of 1989 in an hour-long ceremony that attracted an overflowing crowd. The temporary chapel built by the community was left abandoned until it too, suffered a fiery demise during a Condition 1 storm in 1991.",
74,Wilson's Stone Igloo,Antarctica,"A remains of a stone shelter are a reminder of ""The Worst Journey in the World.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wilsons-stone-igloo,"Wilson’s Stone Igloo is on Igloo Spur, a small spur 160 m. up the general ridge extending southeast from Bomb Peak, east of Ross Island, Antarctica. Named and mapped by New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE), 1958–59, because it was on this feature that Dr. Edward A. Wilson and his party built a stone shelter during Robert Falcon Scott’s British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13 - Scott and Wilson’s last. Ed Wilson, Birdie Bowers, and Apsley Cherry-Garrard set out from Cape Evans in the middle of the Antarctic winter on foot and sledge, a 70-mile journey. They endured extreme cold, frostbite, starvation, and near-death so they could be the first to collect emperor penguin eggs from the colony at Cape Crozier. The party ran into foul weather, lost a tent, and built a makeshift shelter out of rocks where they lay face down for three days waiting for the weather to clear. Their incredible journey is chronicled in Cherry-Garrard’s “The Worst Journey in the World.” The “igloo” now looks like a ring of rocks filled with the tatters of the nearly failed expedition: penguin parts, shreds of canvas, wind-worn wool clothing, a test tube, rope, and rusted tin cans, all perfectly preserved by the Antarctic cold. It is Classified as a Category 1 heritage site (historic monument no. 21) by the Antarctic Heritage Trust.",
75,East Base,Antarctica,One of America's oldest Antarctic research bases is abandoned but still just waiting for visiting explorers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/east-base,"Getting things built in Antarctica is no easy feat and getting rid of them isn’t much easier, which probably explains the number of research bases that were simply abandoned on the ice. In fact, one of America’s earliest outposts on the continent, East Base on Stonington Island, is still just sitting there waiting for anyone bold enough to visit. First built in 1939 by the United States Antarctic Service, East Base was commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, along with a sister base at another location. A team of researchers wintered at the base testing just about anything they could think of including seismic readings, aurora activity, tidal patterns, and the magnetic fields. The Americans evacuated the base in 1941, leaving behind most of the equipment in the hopes that they could return at a later date and continue the work. While the government never ended up sending another group to the station, a private expedition made use of the base in 1947-48, although when they evacuated, they too simply abandoned the huts. After the private researchers left the base was simply left to freeze, along with the hundreds of pieces of equipment that were left behind on the site, creating a perfect time capsule of the research of the time. There was another base nearby that was established by the United Kingdom (Base E) that was in use for decades longer, but the American base simply sat. Today, the remains of the base are still there and are designated as a historic site. It’s not easy to get there of course, but anyone willing to make the trip can check out the huts and see one of the rarest pieces of U.S. history.",
76,Allan Hills,Antarctica,An ice field known for harboring an infamous Martian meteorite turned out to contain the oldest air on Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/allan-hills,"On December 27, 1984, a meteorite was found in the ice field near Allan Hills, a rocky outcrop that protrudes from the blue ice in Victoria Land, East Antarctica. Cosmo-chemical analyses back in the lab revealed a Martian origin. Years later, this meteorite, known as ALH84001, gained popularity as an article published in the journal Science reported structures in the rock and interpreted them as fossilized lifeforms, which, if true, would be the first definitive sign of extraterrestrial life. A media storm ensued, followed by a televised statement by then-President Bill Clinton. The scientific community never fully accepted the claim, however. One concern was the contamination by terrestrial materials. Another is the speculative nature of morphology-based inferences and the lack of more conclusive evidence. The proponents of the extraterrestrial-life hypothesis did not back down. The original paper from 1996 has been cited more than 2,000 times, and to this day, research into ALH84001 is still ongoing. In light of the media attention it receives, ALH84001 is arguably the most well-known meteorite of any kind. Decades later, another discovery from Allan Hills made headlines as a team of scientists found air trapped in the ice buried near Allan Hills that could be up to 2.7 million years old. Yet, according to the paper published on journal Nature in 2019, it appears that the chemical composition of certain pockets of air had been modified by microbial activities, resulting in elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide and a 50 percent depletion of molecular oxygen. Thus, the oldest “pristine” air without any biological perturbation is more likely to be 2 million years old. While the new record was pushed back by some 700,000 years, it still more than doubled the previous “oldest air” record of approximately 800,000 years. The composition of the 2-million-year-old air does not differ much from that of the air we breathe today, other than the air inside that ice having 30 percent less carbon dioxide than modern air. (This excess of carbon is due to man-made emissions from fossil fuel burning.) If one were able to breathe the trapped air, it would not be possible to tell the difference, at least in theory. According to the driller who drilled the ice in the field, the “drinks tasted so good with this old ice” although no scientific evidence has been provided in support of this claim. The presence of meteorites and very old ice near Allan Hills is linked to the same glaciological principle. Near Allan Hills, ice flows along with a rising bedrock topography towards the surface, where ferocious katabatic winds (winds produced by the flow of cold dense air down a slope under the force of gravity) blow the ice away through ablation, leaving the meteorites trapped in the ice behind. This dynamic feature exhumes crystalline glacial ice that is otherwise buried deep in the ice sheets. However, where the 2-million-year-old ice was originally deposited remains unclear. All that is known is that the ice must be brought to Allan Hills from somewhere else.  No one can predict the age limit of the oldest ice near Allan Hills or knows if even older ice would emerge in other places with similar glaciological features.","As every site in Antarctica, Allan Hills is difficult to access. The ""easiest"" approach by far is to submit a scientific proposal and (hopefully) get funded. If you do, you will likely head to McMurdo Station first to receive proper training before being transported to this remote field site by a fixed-wing aircraft. Alternatively, it may be possible to traverse over the ice to reach this location in a motorized convoy, but cautions must always be taken in Antarctica."
77,Kerguelen Islands,French Southern and Antarctic Lands,French scientists make up the majority of the few humans to occupy this remote island in the extreme southern Indian Ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kerguelen-islands,"The Kerguelen Islands are located 2,051 miles away from any sort of civilization. There are no native inhabitants of the island, but as part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands it is permanently occupied by 50 to 100 French scientists, engineers and researchers at any given time of the year. The main island of Kerguelen goes by the morose title of Desolation Island, and is surrounded by almost 300 lonely satellite islands. Massive active glaciers cover the main island, which stretches nearly 100 miles long and reaches 6,445 feet at its highest peak. The islands are so very remote that even if there was an airport, the harsh freezing climate and icy terrain make it an undesirable location for visitors. The only way to and from the island is by ship, but if you plan to take what would basically be the worst vacation ever, a cabin is €15,000 and the ship departs only four times per year, so plan accordingly.",
78,Port Couvreux,French Southern and Antarctic Lands,Scattered ruins and a tiny cemetery are all that remain of a failed attempt to colonize the inhospitable Desolate Islands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/port-couvreux,"In the late 19th century, two French brothers, Henry and René-Émile Bossière, made the not-so-wise decision to try to colonize the Kerguelen Islands (aptly nicknamed the Desolation Islands). The isles are inhospitable; the rocky lands constantly battered by some of the harshest winds on Earth. Despite the unforgiving climate, the Bossière brothers sent a couple shepherds and their families to an isolated peninsula within the archipelago, where they were meant to experiment with keeping sheep on such unwelcoming lands. The shepherds settled within Port Couvreux, but their tenure on the island was short-lived. Many of the sheep died during transport, and the rabbits brought over as a food source ran wild and wreaked havoc on the environment. As the dawn of World War I approached, the settlers left their isolated outpost to return to France. This failed endeavor didn’t put an to the Bossière brothers’ plans to populate the islands. In 1920, they once again shipped more shepherds and sheep off to the faraway archipelago. The settlers built houses and a small farm, attempting to turn Port Couvreux into a successful colony. But again, the livestock couldn’t survive in such a cold, barren climate. Even the people began to perish, some dying in the cold while foraging for food while others succumbed to illness. The last survivors were evacuated in 1931. Scattered ruins and a little cemetery are all that remain of their time in Port Couvreux.","There is also another tomb near Port Couvreux, at Bassin de la Gazelle, of a German marine soldier who died accidentally in 1940."
79,Tromelin Island,French Southern and Antarctic Lands,"Now home to nothing but a weather station and a landing strip, a group of enslaved people were marooned on this tiny island for 15 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tromelin-island,"Tromelin Island, off the coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean is little more than a speck of sand covered in low-lying scrub plants, but miraculously, a group of more than 60 enslaved people were able to survive (some of them at least) for over 15 years after being shipwrecked and left for dead. Back in 1761 a French ship was ferrying around 160 enslaved men and women out of Madagascar, bound for French plantations. While slavery was legal at the time, the captain was not approved as a slaver and so was likely trying to finish his illicit deal quickly. It’s possible that this haste contributed to the wreck of his ship, but either way, not long into their voyage, they ran into the reef surrounding Tromelin Island while trying to navigate it in the dark. The hull was destroyed and water rushed into the cargo hold drowning the majority of the poor souls below deck, however some 60 of the captives were able to swim to safety. Using the wrecked debris from the ship, two camps were made, one for the crew and one for the people they had enslaved. Eventually, the crew men were able to create a new boat out of the debris of the old, but it only had room for the crew. The crew sailed back to Madagascar, vowing to return for the enslaved people, but they must have gotten side-tracked as no one returned for 15 years. The shipwreck survivors kept themselves alive by eating turtles and crabs that came to the island to nest. They built simple shelters by digging rooms into the ground and fortifying them with rocks. They used remaining debris from the ship to fashion small tools, and bowls. It is reported that a group was eventually even able to create a raft that was powered by a sail made of feathers, although its passengers are thought to have died at sea. When a rescue boat was finally sent to the island all those years later, only seven women and child less than a year old remained. The tragic events of Tromelin Island are not remembered by any marker, and the remains of the ship have all but been swept away by the tides, but the remains of the castaways’ shelters and artifacts can still be found on the island. The only other things that share the sandy real estate are a short landing strip and a weather station.",
