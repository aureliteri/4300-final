0,Sigiriya,"Sigiriya, Sri Lanka",An ancient stone fortress considered by many to be the eighth wonder of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sigiriya,"An ancient stone fortress used by a king of Sri Lanka as a place to build his palace and hide from his brother’s attacks, Sigiriya (The Lion Rock) is often considered the eighth wonder of the world. Situated in the central Matale District of Sri Lanka, the fortress is surrounded on all sides by the remains of an extensive network of reservoirs and gardens. These gardens are believed to be some of the oldest landscaped gardens anywhere in the world. The Lion staircase leading to the palace garden at the top of the rock is the most significant feature of this geological masterpiece. An intricate construction, the Lion staircase is a tile-covered walkway that emerges from the open mouth of the beast from which it takes its name and is built of brick and timber. The bricks surround ancient limestone steps. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, this rock is full of archeological importance. The other primary feature that draws thousands of tourists every year is the surviving frescoes and other paintings. The few paintings that survive are the earliest examples of a Sri Lanka school of classical realism, which was fully formed by the 5th century when the paintings at Sigiriya were produced. There are also remains of paintings in some of the caves that are nestled at the foot of the giant rock. According to ancient texts, the entire rock fortress was built by King Kashyapa and, after his death, was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. Today it is a popular tourist destination and one of the first places added to Sri Lanka itineraries. The climb is accessible to people of all ages and levels of fitness.","Sigiriya is situated 17km from the popular town of Dambulla. It is a relatively easy climb, but it can take up to an hour to complete due to the crowds. The main difficulty is the heat, so it is recommended to arrive early in the morning. The best time to visit Sigiriya is between January and April due to the favourable weather and to avoid monsoon season. Tickets are around US$ 30. No special dress code is required, but sensible shoes are recommended."
1,Udawalawe National Park,"Udawalawa, Sri Lanka","Huge herds of Asian elephants can be seen walking, bathing, and just chilling at this Sri Lankan park.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/udawalawe-national-park,"A grave problem facing Sri Lankan wildlife today is the human-elephant conflict, which kills up to 150 jumbos every year. Some of the baby elephants orphaned as a result of this are rehabilitated at the Elephant Transit Home, located on the fringes of the Udawalawe National Park in southern Sri Lanka. The elephant calfs are fed and sheltered during their early years, and once they reach the age of four or five, they are released back into a protected environment and monitored. The park itself is home to nearly 250 elephants, one of the highest concentrations in the country, including some young elephants released from the Transit Home.  The giant Asian elephant is the park’s biggest draw, and visitors are sure to get their fill of these and other creatures before the tour is up. Situated about a five-hour drive away from Sri Lanka’s commercial capital of Colombo, Udawalawe National Park stretches out over 30,000 hectares of grassland across the provinces of Uva and Sabaragamuwa to the island’s south. Visitors can tour through the scrublands, keeping eyes peeled for sightings of everything from wild foxes to wild boar, mongooses to macaques, water buffalos and deer of the sambar and spotted varieties. While the park is not known for playing host to big cat species such as leopards, it does feature some species of medium-sized cats like fishing and jungle cats. The park’s massive Uda Walawe Reservoir attracts a generous number of water-based birds. Some of the water bird species that are a common sight at the park are the Eurasian spoonbills, black-headed ibis, painted stork and spot-billed pelicans, as well as local bird species like the brown-capped babbler, red-faced malhoka, grey hornbill and spurfowl.","The park can be reached by using public buses or private taxis. You also have the option of making part of your journey by flight, for example from Colombo to Hambantota, and then travelling the rest of the way to the park by road. Once you get to the park, you will have to pay entrance fees to enter. Do note, that, while for Sri Lankan passport holders the fee is usually a fairly nominal amount, if you are a foreigner or a member of the Sri Lankan diaspora holding a foreign passport, you will be asked to pay a significantly higher fee."
2,Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid (Red Mosque),"Colombo, Sri Lanka",This mesmerizing architectural wonder will take your breath away with its unusual color patterns.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jami-ulalfar-masjid-red-mosque,"Sri Lanka’s Red Mosque, or Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid, is one of the architectural wonders of the world. Situated in the bustling Pettah district, one of the oldest parts of the city of Colombo, its tall minarets are seen from almost every street, towering over the hustle and bustle of the busy neighborhood streets. It is said that the Red Mosque has been a landmark for sailors approaching the port of Colombo ever since it was built in 1908, and upon looking at it you can easily imagine that being true. The mosque’s distinct red-and-white pattern, whether swirling or spiraling or alternating, is quite mesmerizing. The domes are built in the shape of pomegranate (unlike the traditional onion shape), and the colorful brick patterns are meant to convey the same image. The Red Mosque, also known as Rathu Palliya in Sinhala, and Samman Kottu Palli in Tamil, was built in what is called Indo-Saracenic style, and is reminiscent of the Jamek Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (constructed around the same time). Words cannot convey how exciting it is to see the mosque’s tall minarets and domes from the streets of Pettah, with its busy markets, shops, and bazaars. Pettah literally means “outside of the fort” and has for centuries been a trading outpost. Pettah is a curiosity, with narrow streets and shops overflowing with anything you can think of. But nothing compares with seeing this magnificent structure rising above it all.","It's possible for women to enter and look around as tourists, just please note that you will need to cover your hair and arms and legs. Be respectful of religious customs if you plan to enter and enjoy this architectural wonder."
3,Adam's Peak,"Rochor, Sri Lanka","Once thought to be the Garden of Eden it holds a holy footprint claimed to belong to Adam, Buddha and Shiva.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sri-pada-adam-s-peak,"In the Middle Ages, the Garden of Eden was commonly believed to exist on earth—probably on top of a mountain, or on an island, in order to have survived Noah’s Flood. For those looking to find the exact location of the biblical garden, “East” was a popular direction to start looking in. In 1358, a Florentine monk believed he had found what he was looking for on a very tall mountain on the island of Sri Lanka. Located sixteen kilometers northeast of the city of Ratnapura, Adam’ s Peak - also known as the Samanalakanda in Sinhalese and Sivanolipatha Malai in Tamil - rises 7,360 feet above sea level, and offers an unobstructed view over land and sea. Giovanni Marignolli, who traveled the East for 15 years, declared that this particular mountain was “so close to the earthly paradise that from its top one could see paradise were it not for the cloud cover that hides it from view.” At the top, there is what looks like a fossilized footprint; Marignolli claimed it was Adam’s. The foot-shaped depression is known as the Sri Pada or “sacred footprint” and still holds religious meaning though the claim has gotten more contentious. The Hindus claim the footprint belongs to Shiva while the Buddhists claim the Sri Pada belongs to the Buddha, while Christian and Muslim Sri Lankan’s agree that the print definitely belongs to Adam’s ancient foot. The mountain has been climbed for more than a thousand years, and boasts an illustrious list of famous pilgrims including the Arab traveler Ibn Batuta, and possibly, Alexander the Great. It remains a major shrine site and hiking trail today.",
4,Shark Point Reef,Sri Lanka,One of the few places where inexperienced snorkelers can spot a shark.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shark-point-reef,"Snorkelling on the coral reefs at Pigeon Island National Park  is absolutely fantastic wherever you are on the islands. But the main attraction is the island’s many juvenile and adult blacktip reef sharks. These sharks are up to five feet long and are reliably seen in an area next to the larger of the two islands, known as Shark Point Reef. This nonaggressive species seems to be quite accepting of humans in the water, and snorkelers have an almost guaranteed opportunity to see them—sometimes as close as a couple meters away in water as shallow as a meter deep. It is one of the few places where totally inexperienced snorkelers can have as good a chance of a shark encounter as fully qualified scuba divers. Pigeon Island National Park actually consists of two islands: large and small. It is a marine national park in Sri Lanka located in the general area of the city of Trincomalee and contains some of the best remaining coral reefs of Sri Lanka. Many of the 100 species of corals and 300 coral reef fishes recorded around the area are found in this national park. The coral reef is visited by Hawkesbill Turtle, Green Turtle and Olive Ridley Turtle and the island is important breeding ground for the rock pigeon. The area was badly affected by the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 but has now largely recovered.",The map pin shows the best place to enter the water to see the sharks. The best conditions for snorkelling or diving on this side of Sri Lanka is from late March to Late October. The Sri Lanka Navy runs a holiday resort for navy personnel families on Nillaveli beach and runs its own  boats out to the island which makes it quite busy at times The nearest town is the tourist town Nillaveli. The national park is situated about 1000 meters off Nillaveli Beach. From here you can take a motor boat out to the island. The boat fee usually includes the entry fee to the national park. Whilst neither are cheap  it is certainly good value.
5,Brief Garden,"Kirantidiya, Sri Lanka","This luscious masterpiece created by landscape designer Bevis Bawa inspired the work of his brother, a famous Sri Lankan architect.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brief-garden,"Plants spill down the sides of the house, blanketing it in a layer of lush greenery. Stems sprout from sculpted pots, while elsewhere pink flowers erupt into a dazzling, colorful display. It’s an enchanting place, one where its creator’s personality and love for the landscape come alive. Brief Garden is the masterpiece of Bevis Bawa, brother of the famous Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. Bevis, the elder Bawa brother, began crafting this luscious landscape roughly 20 years before Geoffrey commenced work on his world-famous Lunuganga Estate. Bevis created the garden by spending decades transforming the rubber plantation he inherited into the verdant jungle-esque gem it is today. He began cultivating the space in the late 1920s while serving in the army and continued up until he died at age 89 in 1992. Thankfully, the estate is still maintained and open to the public. It errs on the wild side for a garden, with tangles of vines creeping down the walls of the buildings. It has an intimate atmosphere, making you feel as though you’ve left the town behind and stepped into your own secluded slice of the jungle. Narrow paths wind through tropical plants, revealing a pool, patio, and staircase. Archways cloaked in greenery lead to hidden statues like carved faces and a stoic horse tucked among the flora. The house, too, is worth a peek. The art within it and the garden reflect Bevis’ personality and life. Homoerotic sculptures dot the space, and a stunning mural depicting Sri Lankan life adorns one of the walls.","If you’re in Colombo, you can easily arrive at the Brief Garden within two hours' drive. One has to buy a ticket to get in, but it’s nothing too expensive, and the tour lasts about an hour and a half and is definitely an experience you won’t soon forget. The antique sculptures are prohibited from being interacted with so children should always be accompanied by adults. One should also dress light since the weather is fairly tropical, and carry an umbrella since rain is also quite common."
6,Helga's Folly,"Kandy, Sri Lanka","A Bohemian ""anti-hotel"" offers off-kilter stays in Sri Lanka.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/helga-s-folly,"Even hotels which are considered “off the beaten path” generally offer a standard lodging experience, but Sri Lanka’s Helga’s Folly presents a junkman’s paradise of faded luxury. A meandering crimson mansion nestled in the Sri Lankan jungle, the home of eccentric proprietor Helga de Silva Blow Perera has been turned into an overstuffed hotel full of knick-knacks and memories. After inheriting the property from her parents, de Silva turned her former home, full of sumptuous pillows, beds, and couches, into an intimate traveling destination. Visitors can rent a room for the night and relax among the house’s many rich parlors surrounded by walls covered in every manner of decoration from taxidermy to the countless picture frames displaying old press clippings of Hollywood gone by. The Folly takes great pride from its former celebrity lodgers including Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh who once had a very public feud around the location. This kitschy kingdom is maybe the last thing one would expect to find in the jungles of Sri Lanka, but somehow Helga’s Folly seems right at home.",
7,Pettah Floating Market,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Pettah's beautiful floating market was once a stinky canal in a sketchy industrial area.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pettah-floating-market,"The Pettah Floating Market is a recent development in Bastian Mawatha, which lives in the Pettah neighborhood of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Now a calm spot for shopping and a quiet stroll, it was once a chaotic canal-side area of rundown warehouses, stinky water, and dubious characters involved in equally questionable activities. In the 1990s, the area now occupied by the floating market was one of the most dangerous zones in Pettah. Dilapidated buildings and abandoned factories lined the old colonial canal side, and pushy hawkers, drug dealers, and other nefarious types had turned the area into a place most people tried to avoid. In the last few years, as Colombo began a series of ambitious beautification projects, this part of Pettah was a prime target for redevelopment. The local council brought in the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to tidy up the area, who in turn contacted the Ministry of Defense for assistance. Engineering units were brought in from the Sri Lanka Army and Sri Lanka Navy, who began to redevelop this part of Bastian Mawatha. Looking to transform the area, the UDA then called on a young architect named Thushari Kariyawasam. His vision led to today’s floating market, an oasis of calm in busy Colombo, with smooth cement paths and polished wooden walkways running along and over the widened—and cleaned—canal. Along these walkways are a series of red-roofed pagodas, in which more than 90 stalls have been allocated to local street vendors, many of whom were uprooted during this and other developments, but who were allowed to move back into the new stalls. They had to pay rent, unlike before, and some, unfortunately, didn’t last for long—but those that remained have found a far more relaxed way of making a living. The stalls sell a wide range of products, including electronics, clothes, shoes, jewelry, local handicrafts, fruit, and vegetables. Some are also snack bars selling local specialties to hungry tourists and amorous locals out for romantic sunset strolls along the walkways. The redevelopment project hasn’t been a total success. Traders still complain about high rent and low sales, and stalls often remain shut for long periods of time. Some visitors, meanwhile, are somewhat put off by the occasionally smelly water, which can become overly malodorous especially during the heat of the summer. Still, it’s a fine place for a quiet wander, some casual shopping, and pretty photos at sunset.","You don't have to pay to enter the Pettah Floating Market. There are entrances at the west and east ends; the main entrance is on the west side, but either will do. It's open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. To get there, take a bus to Pettah Bus Station or Bastian Mawatha Bus Station. For the best photos, head to the market around 5 p.m. to catch the golden hour."
8,Fa-Hien Lena (Pahiyangala Cave),"Gavaragiriya, Sri Lanka","The remains of a 37,000-year-old prehistoric society were discovered in this mammoth cave, one of the largest in Asia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pahiyangala-caves-sri-lanka,"Located in the village of Yatagampitiya in Sri Lanka, Fa-Hien Lena (also known as Pahiyangala Cave) is the largest cave on the island, and one of the largest natural rock formations in all of Asia. The cave was also the site of a remarkable archaeological discovery that dug up human skulls dating back about 37,000 years—the remains of one of the region’s oldest prehistoric human settlements. Surrounded by tropical greens, the mammoth cave measures 200 feet long, with an entrance 175 feet high and 160 feet wide, and sits 400 feet above sea level. There are areas inside the cave which are over 400 feet high. As archaeological research is still being conducted, many of the cave’s natural tunnels have been blocked. Aside from research, the cave is also the home of a Buddhist temple. A local monk used a heavy stone tool to clear the cave entrance and level the ground. Visitors to the cave are greeted by the temple’s 40 foot long reclining Buddha statue. Beyond the cave’s natural beauty, the archaeological finds within it make it a remarkable piece of history. In addition to the human skulls the Sri Lankan Archaeological Departments found, they also discovered weapons from the same era. These weapons, made from animal bones and stones, were used to kill deer, monkeys, porcupines, and other animals. According to researchers, evidence found in the cave suggests that these early humans also ate “a few types of edible snails and wild breadfruit.” Researchers have also discovered that after eating the snails, the cave’s earliest residents would pierce their shells to make jewelry. Getting to the cave can be a bit of a struggle, with about a 20 minute walk up stone steps (without a railing), but it’s a popular spot for school trips and picnickers.","A long walk and semi-strenuous climb is required to visit the Pahiyangala Cave, but compared to the other historic sites in Sri Lanka, the climb and walk, in this case, is minimal. Located about 40km away from Colombo, this is a close site and is an easy drive too. The place is accessible from Kalutara and Horana and when you take the Piliyandala Bulathsinghala Road and pass the rice fields and villages, you’ll find yourself at the stony path that leads up to the cave’s entrance. The steps in the path are cemented, but you’d find natural stone steps in between, and they must be stepped on carefully as they have jagged edges and can cause discomfort if stomped on. The excavation pit is open to visitors, and if you’re curious, you can walk down the stairs and into the pit and take a look at the digs with your own eyes. Within the cave, you’d find an ancient door that leads you into the bat cave, not like DC, but real bats that can hit you in the face when they fly out, so step in with care!"
9,Saint Anthony’s Church and Cemetery,Sri Lanka,The ruins of this old church are slowing sinking into the sand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saint-anthonys-church-and-cemetery,"On the far northeastern beaches of Sri Lanka there is a tiny village called Manalkadu. It doesn’t see many tourists—and with only one battered unnamed road to get there, that’s not surprising. What is surprising, once you do arrive, is finding the ruins of a once-majestic church, and a collection of modest graves nearby, watching as the walls are slowly eaten by sand. The church is the old St. Anthony’s, but exactly how old is a little murky. Some accounts date it to the 17th century, during the period of Dutch rule. Others put the date around 1900, when Sri Lanka was the British colony known as Ceylon. Whatever the age, the effect of the stone, brick and coral walls slowly sinking into the dunes provides an eerie and striking backdrop to the modest cross markers that dot the sand, and the deep blue Indian Ocean just beyond. The crosses are the graves of local residents, many of whom were among the thousands of Sri Lankans who lost their lives in the 2004 tsunami. As with the church walls, the dunes around the graves are always shifting, the sand revealing either too much or too little of what’s buried below. The history of Sri Lanka goes back at least 3,000 years, to the days of the ancient Silk Road. Until 2014 it was difficult to get a visa to visit the area of the old St. Anthony’s, but tourism has since opened up as the political and economic conditions in Sri Lanka have improved. The sands, always shifting.","The ruins and cemetery are along the beach just north of the small village of Manalkadu, about 6 miles from the town of Point Pedro. It is on the Jaffna peninsula at the very northern tip of the island. Many of the area roads are unnamed, so you can set your GPS to the coordinates up top. Note that there is a new, rebuilt St. Anthony’s in the village, not to be confused with the ruins. Also, there are reports from some tour sites that the beaches around Manalkuda are patrolled by the army. Check with local tourism authorities or agencies as to current access and any restrictions for visitors."
10,The Main Line,"Nanuoya, Sri Lanka","Known as the most scenic route in Sri Lanka, this train line is steeped in history and offers an unparalleled view of the country.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-main-line,"The Main Line was the name given to this railway line by the British who are often credited with its construction beginning around 1874. It was the first major line constructed on the island and was originally designed to link tea growing estates in the mountains to the port at Colombo. However, while the desire to build the railroad came from the British, many of its key elements were constructed and designed by a group of talented local engineers. This fantastic railway line runs from Colombo Fort station to Badulla, some 182 miles to the east. It passes through both natural and cultivated countrysides, which include quite a few tea plantations. The breathtaking views and natural beauty are complemented by the train’s journey through various towns and villages. Even express trains along this line only travel at about 15 mph through the winding mountain terrain, allowing for passengers to soak in their surroundings. One of the more unique features along the line is the Demodara Railway Loop. This is a junction where the track spirals sharply, passing over itself to gain height in a short distance. Such configurations are not uncommon on railways in mountainous regions, but what makes this one so unique is the station that sits directly over the tunnel, allowing the line to cross itself. It’s said that the engineer who designed the loop was inspired by watching a man tie and retie his Talappawa. There is a famous train service along the Main Line called the Blue Train, which runs from Kandy to Ella. It’s a very popular trip among tourists due to the modern carriages and air-conditioned first class. The trains themselves are Chinese built, diesel multiple units, with a power car and driving cab at each end. However, the intercity services, which run all the way to and from Colombo Fort Station, are hauled by traditional diesel locomotives and include a much more diverse range of coaches. The second and third class coaches have opening windows and provide better views than first-class, making for better photo ops. Many of the trains also include a special observation car at the rear. It’s arguably the best way to experience the journey; with a marvelous view along the backend of the tracks. One of the most well-used stations is Nanu Oya, which is the closest one to the mountain resort of Nuwara Eliya. It was here that British colonials decamped during the hot summer months.","The coordinates are for Nanu Oya station which is the 63rd station on the line from Colombo Fort. When getting off at Colombo Fort, hold onto your ticket until well outside the station, checkpoints seem to be numerous and random. You need to book the train a couple of days in advance to ensure you get the seat of your choice. Buying tickets on the day is cheaper, but with a 5-6 hour journey in first class, including advanced booking, at about £5, the cost is not really an issue. If you have the time, a return route from Nanu Oya to Kandy by road (two buses per hour but a 4-5 hour trip, some are air-conditioned) will take you past some spectacular scenery you don't see on the train and is worth the extra time."
11,Buduruwagala,"Buduruwagala, Sri Lanka","Seven beautiful 1,000-year-old rock-cut Buddhist statues.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buduruwagala,"Buduruwagala is a rock temple dating back to the ninth or 10th century. It consists of seven ancient Buddhist figures carved into the face of a large cliff. The largest measures 51 feet high, making it the tallest Buddha statue in Sri Lanka. The giant Buddha figure is situated at the center of the cliff face, flanked by three smaller statues on both sides. On the right are depictions of the Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, the Goddess Tara, and Prince Sudhana; on the left are Maitree Bodhisattva, and Vajrapani Bodhisattva. These are figures from the Mahayana tradition of Buddhism. A faint orange hue is visible on the tallest statue, suggesting that the carvings were probably painted originally. Several square niches are carved into the rock above the statues; their use is not known. By the right foot of the Buddha is a 4-foot-high hole shaped like a flame. The deepest reaches of this hole are always wet with a substance that smells like mustard oil. It is speculated that Buduruwagala (which roughly translates to “rock with Buddha statues”) was a hermitage site for Mahayana Buddhist monks, but no information other than the approximate age of the carvings has come to light so far. These days, a modern building houses a small number of monks that reside here.","Buduruwagala can be reached from either Wellawaya or Thanamalwila. The last 2.5 miles (4 km) are on a dirt track through a set of lakes, home to egrets and herons."
12,Adam's Bridge,"Mannar, Sri Lanka","According to Hindu belief, this shallow island chain was created by a god with an army of monkeys.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adams-bridge,"Sri Lanka is an island, or at least that’s what they want you to think. The 18-mile gap between it and India is filled with shoals and sandbanks, that religious tradition holds are the remains of a bridge built by Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. And actually, some scientists now believe that the clerics might have a point. A thin strand of shoals, some only feet below the sea, stretch from India to Sri Lanka. The British Empire made a sort of steampunk Chunnel, going from rail to steamship, a century ago. Plans to blast open the rocks for shipping have run aground on something unexpected: religious Hindus who believe Adam’s Bridge to be a relic from the Ramayana epic. The story goes that Rama set an army of monkeys to work building a bridge to the island redoubt of the demon king Ravana. It may sound far-fetched to secular ears, but there are records from as late as the Medieval era that describe an international walking path. India’s ruling party has refused to permit construction of the shipping channel. Satellite imagery is undeniable; a filament connects the landmasses just under the surface. Photographs or videos aren’t enough to make any case closed. Religion or obstruction, history or myth, it’s in the eye of the analyst, but the underwater land link is definitely there. Plenty of tour agencies have taken advantage of the barely submerged islands, putting the rocky outcroppings on the “Rama Trail” of Sri Lanka’s Hindu legacy. A traveler could do that, or perhaps rent out a private boat. They wouldn’t see anything that hasn’t been argued about online. But at least a traveler could see it for himself.",
13,Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",This elaborate temple was built around one of the Buddha's teeth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-of-the-tooth,"Located in the appropriately-named-to-Western-ears town of Kandy in Sri Lanka, the Temple of the Tooth offers some sweet Eastern architecture surrounding a religious relic. According to local tradition, the Buddha’s tooth was given to the Sri Lankan monarchy in ancient times. Whoever holds the relic is said to hold the governance of the country. The tooth was passed around through various kings and holy men who hid, moved, and relocated the sacred relic across centuries. Now the tooth is housed in a dedicated temple inside the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy. Worshipers can visit the relic, which is held in a golden stupa inside the two-story shrine. The relic is encased in seven golden caskets which are engraved and inlaid with precious gemstones. Although parts of the shrine were destroyed and rebuilt over the years in various bombings and acts of war, the building still retains its opulent style of gold and moonstone, surrounded by Buddhist carvings and offerings. This piece of peace may be small, but the Temple of the Tooth makes it seem as important as the Buddha himself.",
14,Wewurukannala Vihara,"Dikwella, Sri Lanka","To gaze upon the visage of Sri Lanka's biggest Buddha, one must first pass through the Tunnel of Hell.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wewurukannala-vihara,"Wewurukannala Vihara is most famous for a gargantuan seated Buddha waiting to greet devout pilgrims, but the temple’s most wonderfully unexpected (and unsettling) feature lies somewhere along the way. The temple is divided into three parts, the oldest of which dates back to the 18th-century reign of King Rajadhi and has a more modest Buddha worked into the structure’s outward-facing architecture. The second element, the giant Buddha statue, was constructed in the 1960s when a penchant for larger-than-life roadside attractions took the world by storm. At 160 feet tall, it literally and figuratively rises above the quagmires of earthly life. Which leads to the third, most overlooked, aspect of Wewurukannala Vihara: in order to meet the big Buddha up-close, visitors must first navigate the Tunnel of Hell. Down in the tunnel, life-sized models illustrate what will happen should one succumb to all those earthly temptations lining the path to enlightement. It is Buddhist Hell made tangible, played out in cartoonish horror before visitors’ eyes. Highlights include immersion in boiling cauldrons, disembowelment, and sinners being hacked to pieces by human-like demons with fangs. The end result is a visit to Wewurukannala Vihara and its message reads as strikingly one in the same: Don’t stop in the middle, for a serene paradise awaits just on the other side.","At the town of Dikwella, 22km from Matara, a road turns inland towards Beliatta. The temple is approximately 1.5km down the road."
15,Koneswaram Temple,"Trincomalee, Sri Lanka",An ancient temple to the Hindu god Shiva surrounded by jaw-dropping scenery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koneswaram-temple,"On a spectacular promontory overlooking one of the world’s largest natural harbours, there is an ancient temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. It is at the head of Konesar Malai (Swami Rock) on the dramatic Gokarna Bay, a seasonal home to blue whales. Surrounded by jaw-dropping scenery on all sides, the colourful Koneswaram temple sits high above the bay, a classical-medieval complex in the Eastern Province city of Trincomalee. The site is a religious pilgrim centre, and is one of the five “Pancha Ishwarams” (abodes of Shiva) that were built in coastal regions of Sri Lanka to honor the supreme god of Hinduism. The dates of the temple have been debated, with some scholars citing the original to around 400 BC, and later construction from as early as the 5th century to as late as the 18th. At one time the complex was as large and grand as any in India or Sri Lanka. The grandeur was mostly lost in the 17th century at the hands of the colonial Portuguese, who razed structures, dumped some into the sea, destroyed objects, and smashed ornamentation. To salvage what they could, priests and devotees of the temple scrambled to bury their sacred objects, even taking advantage of the sea itself rather than seeing them crushed in the raid. The original temple is claimed by some to have been the greatest building of its age, for both its architecture and its ornamentation. It combined key features to form a typically southern Indian plan, such as a thousand-pillared hall (similar to the famous “Aayiram Kaal Mandapam” in Madurai, India) and raised platform (or “jagati”) configuration, features that had been destroyed. It was said that its gopuram (gateway tower) was visible to sailors approaching Sri Lanka from the sea. The evidence for this magnificence comes from unearthing the very remnants that were buried, as well as the discovery of key pieces at the bottom of the bay. They were found by photographer Mike Wilson and science-fiction author, Arthur C. Clarke. In 1956, Wilson and Clarke uncovered masonry, idol images, carved columns with flower insignias, and elephant head carvings while scuba-diving. More importantly, they also retrieved the legendary Swayambhu lingam;  a large stone phallus / obelisk said to originate from a Tibetan mountain top. Upon reinstalling the lingam to the temple, Wilson was so overwhelmed by the experience that he renounced his career and family to become a Hindu swami. As well as the recovered underwater pieces, there are also some original drawings done by Constantino de Sá de Noronha, the Portuguese governor responsible for the destruction. Restoration work was completed in 1963 with the old pieces reinstalled. Today the site is reborn, and there is some quite modern construction as well. And while the current site does not match up to the pre-1624 temple, it is still an awe-inspiring place to visit, for Hindus and non-Hindus alike.","The temple is on the northeastern coast of Sri Lanka, at the very end of Konesar Road. Continue past Fort Frederick (currently an army base, and formerly a British colonial fort) and follow the path lined with shops. You’ll walk through various courtyard shrines, eventually reaching the giant statue of Shiva at the promontory. The temple requests all visitors to please respect the religious customs and propriety, including appropriate dress. Be prepared to remove your shoes."
16,Kumbuk River Resort,"Buttala, Sri Lanka",Spend the night inside a two-story elephant villa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kumbuk-river-resort,"After 26 years of civil war, the government of Sri Lanka finally defeated rebels and restored control over the island in 2009. Since that time, Sri Lanka has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and has worked to bring in more visitors through eco-tourism. One of the hottest new spots for eco-tourism in the nation is the Kumbuk River Resort. Billed as an eco-preserve, the resort lets tourists rent out the entire 14-acre plot, and stay in the world’s largest elephant. Not exactly a live elephant, but a 2-story thatched elephant-shaped villa. Resembling a jungle-dwelling trojan horse, the elephant villa even has modern amenities; living room, bathroom and plunge pool. From the location, visitors can explore the surrounding landscape and see real elephants during the day and rest in the belly of the beast at night. To preserve the environment of the resort, no more than 12 guests may stay at the resort at one time.",
17,Richmond Castle in Kalutara,"Kalutara, Sri Lanka","This palatial, 99-doored Colonial mansion is a marvel of architectural fusion.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/richmond-castle-kalutara,"Once upon a time in the land known to many as “paradise,” there lived a wealthy landowner and philanthropist by the name of (brace yourself) Padikara Mudali Nanayakkara Rajawasala Appuhamilage Don Arthur de Silva Wijesinghe Siriwardena. Don Arthur de Silva, as he is more commonly known, dreamed of owning his own castle built according to the great architecture and art of the buildings he admired during his education in England as well as the palace of the Maharaja of Ramnad in India. His dream came true in 1910 when the majestic Richmond Castle opened its doors—99 of them, to be exact. Sprawled across a 42-acre estate, the castle features intricate carvings, 34 windows embellished with stained glass of exquisite designs, an immense dance hall and staircase of teak especially imported from Burma. The architectural gem is a fusion of different styles from the East and West—tiles from India, window panes from Italy and Scotland, Roman-Dutch style details. The palatial castle was fit for a fairytale, but Don Arthur de Silva needed a princess. When he wed his bride Clarice the couple was welcomed by not just a throng of locals but the Maharaja of Ramnad and the Prince and Princess of Wales. Unfortunately, the marriage did not survive long, for the couple was devastated by their inability to conceive children and separated. Don Arthur de Silva left the Richmond Castle and all his grand possessions to destitute children who needed a shelter, and lived the remainder of his life in a room at the Queen’s Hotel in Kandy. Today the castle, somewhat deteriorated, is owned by the Public Trustee and open to the public to tour its unique architecture and 100-year history.","The Richmond Castle is located in Tekkawatta, Palatota in Kalutara South. It’s open for public viewing from 8.30am to 4.30pm on weekdays, except for public holidays such as Poya Days. Cost for entry is LKR 50 for locals and LKR 500 for foreigners."
18,Kande Vihara,"Beruwala, Sri Lanka",This amazing mountain temple is topped by one of the tallest sitting Buddha statues in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kande-vihara,"A giant Buddha perches atop a colorful pedestal at Kande Viharaya, an 18th-century hilltop temple. Sitting cross-legged, he stares straight ahead over the walkway, his expression empty. At 160 feet tall, he’s one of the tallest sitting Buddha statues in the world. The massive statue has been successful at drawing more locals to the historic temple since it was unveiled in 2007. It’s an eye-catching sight, one you’re sure to notice from a distance. However, the amazing Kande Viharaya has far more to offer than just its signature statue. Since it was founded in 1734, the temple has been an important site for Sri Lankan buddhism. Though it has changed throughout the centuries, thanks to new additions and necessary maintenance, it hasn’t strayed too far from its original basis. As such, the government officially recognizes it as an archaeological site. Step inside the temple and you’ll discover it houses a library, museum, and figures of Sri Lanka’s past kings. You’ll of course find more statues of Buddha, though they’re obviously much smaller than the one that greets visitors. There’s also Bodhi Tree, thought to be more than 300 years old, and a beautiful stone moonstone, a classic feature of architecture first seen in Sri Lanka’s Anuradhapura Kingdom.","Go south and take the Colombo to Galle route. When you pass Beruwala, you will spot a Kaluwamodara Bridge, which is about 36 miles away from Colombo. Get on the bridge and turn left at its end. After about half a mile, you will reach the Kande Viharaya. The total travel time to get to the temple will be approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes excluding any traffic on the roads."
19,Old Kachcheri,"Jaffna, Sri Lanka",These abandoned ruins in the middle of Jaffna have withstood centuries of tumultuous power struggles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-kachcheri,"Old Park is now a fancy modern park with playgrounds, fast food outlets, and well-curated jogging paths. But tucked away in a corner you’ll find the forgotten ruins of the Old Kachcheri. Vines and plants now look like integral parts of this beautiful example of Neo-Renaissance architecture, and moss adorns the Roman arches wrapping around the central yard. The crumbling roof now invites the elements to destroy the interior rooms. A kachcheri is a district secretariat that functions as a liaison between the central Sri Lanka  government and its activities at district level. Within its own district, a kachcheri also implements government projects, collects revenues, and organizes elections. Expectedly, a bureaucratic branch of the government of this magnitude requires a large facility to accommodate it. Jaffna, being the capital city of the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, is also home of the local kachcheri. Prior to delving into the Old Kachcheri buildings, it’s necessary to become familiar with Jaffna’s tumultuous colonial past. Portugal conquered the island in 1619, and the Dutch eventually took over in 1658. The final twist in the colonial saga occurred in 1796, when the British gained control of all the Dutch possessions in Sri Lanka. It was the British Government Agent Percival Ackland Dyke that bought the 27-acre property and commissioned the building of an administrative center. The administrative center became Jaffna Kachcheri, now known as the Old Kachcheri. History was not always kind to the Old Kachcheri, which went from being targeted by rival armies to being abandoned. The presence of a huge building tailor-made for administrative purposes didn’t escape the attention of the country’s armies. Starting in the late 1970s, the Sri Lanka Army was based at Old Park and made full use of the Old Kachcheri buildings. As the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a militant Tamil organization, seized Jaffna in the late 1980s, they also used Old Park and Old Kachcheri as military and police headquarters. When Sri Lanka regained control of Jaffna in 1995, an army camp was briefly stationed at the kachcheri, but after the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War the building was evacuated and abandoned. Disintegration that began through human agency is now carried out by nature. Vegetation is taking over buildings, and the weather is slowly but surely grinding the building to oblivion.","There are rumors that renovation works may begin, but to date nothing has started.Mines still represent a danger in and around the immediate area surrounding Old Kachcheri. De-mining was undertaken, but the property hasn’t been declared mine-free as yet. Caution recommended."
20,Dambulla Royal Cave Temple,"Dambulla, Sri Lanka",This ancient cave temple complex is the largest and best-preserved temple complex in Sri Lanka.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dambulla-cave-temple-2,"Through the golden mouth of a lion-like creature and a short hike up a hill are five gorgeous caves that are home to some of the most magnificent temples in Sri Lanka. The caves contain larger-than-life statues and elaborate, vibrant paintings of Buddha. Visitors can wander through colonial style outdoor hallways that connect the caves with man-made lily ponds. For more than two millennia, this has been a Buddhist pilgrimage site. The site dates as far back as the first century BC  and is still home to Buddhist monks who manage the property. The temple was carved directly into the rock face in such a way that rainwater never enters the interior caves. The exterior remains a striking white color, despite much of the conservation of the site focusing on the interior murals. Of the five caves, the largest is over 160 feet (50 meters) wide and 65 feet (20 meters) deep. Known as the Cave of the Great Kings, it houses not only statues of Buddha in various poses, but also statues of the gods Vishnu and Saman, as well as Sri Lankan kings of old. Many tourists combine a visit to Dambulla with a trip to Sigiriya as the two are not far apart. Sigiriya, the Lion Rock, can be seen from the Dambulla cave temple complex.","The hike is moderate, incorporating some rock stairs and takes about 20 minutes. Beware of monkeys that fight along the path. There is also a museum. You will be required to remove your shoes and wear clothing that covers your knees in order to be permitted entry."
21,Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi,"Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka",This sacred fig tree with a link to the Buddha is one of the oldest human-planted trees in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jaya-sri-maha-bodhi-tree,"The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is a sacred fig tree, or Ficus religiosa, that stands in the Mahamewna Gardens in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. Not only is it the closest authentic living link to Gautama Buddha, it is also the oldest human-planted tree in the world with a known planting date and a recorded history. About 2,600 years ago, Lord Gautama Buddha sat with his back against an Esathu tree on the banks of the Neranjana River in Bodhgaya, India. It was at this moment, as he sat against the tree, that the Buddha is said to have achieved enlightenment. In doing so, the tree also gained a venerated status. It became known as the Bodhi tree, and pilgrims came to see it even within the lifetime of the Buddha. Later, in 236 BC, the Buddhist nun Sanghamitta Maha Theri was sent by the Emperor Asoka from India to Sri Lanka. With her she carried a southern branch of the original sacred fig. This branch was ceremoniously presented to Devanampiya Tissa, one of the earliest kings of Sri Lanka whose reign was notable for the arrival of Buddhism. In 288 BC, Tissa planted the branch of the Bodhi tree in his Royal Park in Anuradhapura. The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, as it became known, has since been cared for and protected by Buddhist monks and dedicated kings. Statues, water canals, golden fences, and walls have been built around the tree over the centuries, and many vows and offerings have been made by Buddhists at the foot of the sacred fig. At times the tree has faced serious threats, and not only from wild elephants. Two storms in 1907 and 1911 resulted in broken branches. A vandal attacked the tree in 1929, hacking off another branch. And then, in 1985, Tamil Tiger separatists stormed the site and massacred 146 Sinhales-Buddhists on the upper terrace. The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, however, remains standing, as revered as ever. And for as long as it continues to thrive, it will remain the oldest cultivated tree in the world with a documented written history.","The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is located within the ancient Mahamewna Gardens, which were created by King Mutasiva (367 - 307 BC). Other attractions inside the gardens include the Samadhi Statue of the Buddha and a handful of stupas. The gardens are open for all ages and nationalities, religious or otherwise."
22,Unawatuna Peace Pagoda,"Unawatuna, Sri Lanka","This peaceful, round shrine in the middle of the Sri Lankan jungle acts as a beacon of peace.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/unawatuna-peace-pagoda,"Looking across the water from Galle Fort in Sri Lanka, this Buddhist shrine resembles a giant marshmallow rising out of the rainforest. Built with the help of Japanese monks, the peace pagoda on Rumasalla Hill is one of three Buddhist stupas in Sri Lanka. Stupas are monuments that serve as beacons of peace for people of all nationalities and creeds, and the clean, rounded design of the Unawatuna pagoda exemplifies this. Visitors can walk or drive the shaded path to the Peace Pagoda and they will be rewarded with a towering, white bell-like structure surrounded by gold-painted statues. Sets of steps also lead to a walkway encircling the shrine which offers a 360-degree view of the jungle and bay.","On the headland between Galle and Unawatuna, a 2 km walk (or bumpy drive) from the beach."
23,Kantharodai,"Jaffna, Sri Lanka","This rural Sri Lankan village hides a cluster of small, enigmatic stupas.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kantharodai,"Tucked away among the backyards and secondary roads in the rural hamlet of Kantharodai is an archaeological site that goes by the same name. It consists of about 20 relatively small stupas (the largest is 20 feet in diameter), and they are the burial site of 60 Tamil monks. Coins from the Roman Empire and ancient Chinese Dynasties have been found nearby, but this is not surprising, since Kantharodai is located in the vicinity of what used to be an important port. A site in Tamil Nadu with strikingly similar constructions suggests that cultural exchange between the two regions was rife in antiquity. Furthermore, the two sites show how Buddhism and Megalithism are interwoven. Recent excavations have revealed some evidence that perhaps Tamil Hindus also worshipped these stupas. Not much else is known about this site, which makes it somewhat mysterious. There are rumors that treasures are buried under the stupas, and there seems to be some confusion even about their age. Some claims they are over 2,000 years old, while others insist they’re more recent reconstructions. To add to the mystique, a sign maintains that Buddha himself visited Kantharodai.","Kantharodai is signposted as Kathurugoda Ancient Vihara along the road. The different name is due to a convoluted etymological evolution of its ancient name, as well as the intermittent use of Tamil and Sinhalese languages to refer to it. You will have to leave your footwear at the entrance and wander around the site barefoot. No information is available on site."
24,Borella Kanatte General Cemetery,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",This Sri Lankan cemetery is the final resting place of sci-fi legend Sir Arthur C. Clarke.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/borella-kanatte-general-cemetery,"Established in 1866, the hauntingly beautiful Kanatte General Cemetery is the main burial ground and crematorium for Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka. Located in the suburban city of Borella, those buried at the cemetery include soldiers killed in both World War I and World War II. The 48-acre cemetery features sections for the many faiths of Colombo’s diverse international population. Hindus, Buddhists, Shintos, Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and non-denominational Christians all have their own burial sections. There are four crematoriums, and elaborate temples and mausoleums dot the lush landscape. Over the years, there have been numerous reports of paranormal activity at the cemetery. Caretakers have reported seeing ghostly meetings (called “resveem”) at a crossroads where four pathways meet. According to one worker, a group of “rationalists” once attempted to spend the night in the graveyard. They only lasted for a short while, before they were hit with stones thrown from ghostly hands. And there is the tale of a nattily dressed man in a white suit, who lures workers to a mortuary and then disappears into a wall, causing workers to faint and fall. The cemetery’s most famous Western resident is British-born Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who moved to Sri Lanka in 1956, when it was still called Ceylon. An inventor, scuba diver, ecologist, teacher, futurist, and author of science-fiction masterpieces such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, he was also active in Sri Lankan affairs. He served as Chancellor of Moratuwa University, the country’s “most sought after technological college,” from 1979-2002. Clarke was famous for his accurate predictions of numerous technological advances in the 20th century, including the mass production of desktop computers and the rise of online banking and online shopping. He also hosted television shows, including Arthur C. Clarke’s Mysterious World and Arthur C. Clarke’s World of Strange Powers. He died in 2008. Today, the lovely Kanatte General Cemetery is a wonderful place to visit. But beware, you may run into fellow travelers, both living and dead.",Arthur C. Clarke’s grave is between lanes 7 and 8 on the left-hand side (if you are approaching from the main entrance). It can be hard to find so you may have to ask around for help. The closest landmark is a flat white pavilion.
25,Sri Lanka Planetarium,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",The first and only planetarium in Sri Lanka.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sri-lanka-planetarium,"Sri Lanka Planetarium has attracted a regular stream of stargazers and field-tripping school kids ever since it opened back in 1965. With its interesting architecture and engaging staff, it proudly stands as the first and only planetarium in Sri Lanka. The first thing you’ll notice about the Sri Lanka Planetarium in Colombo is its interesting and strangely familiar architecture. Designed by A. N. S. Kulasinghe, the chief engineer of the State Engineering Corporation of Ceylon, it was built in the shape of a lotus in full bloom. It also borrowed from two famous buildings on different continents: the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral by Sir Frederick Gibberd, and Oscar Niemeyer’s Cathedral of Brasília. Following a much-needed refurbishment in 2014, the planetarium now has 570 seats below its main dome, onto which a new 4D/Digital full dome projector displays the universe in all its glory. You can take a tour of the galaxy, see the night sky as it appears from another country, witness the midnight sun from the Arctic Circle, and marvel at solar eclipses, meteor showers, comets, and various other celestial events. The planetarium also hosts frequent science exhibitions, workshops, and seminars that attract people from across Sri Lanka and beyond. From its very beginnings up until 2015, another stellar attraction at the planetarium was Christie Pillai, who had served as a lecturer from the very beginning. Pillai passed away in 2015 but remains a legend at the Sri Lanka Planetarium. Not only was he a hugely popular, entertaining and knowledgeable member of the planetarium staff, but he was also once the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Astronomical Association set up by science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, with whom he had a close working relationship.","Sri Lanka Planetarium is located on the grounds of the University of Colombo campus, just off a road named Prof. Stanley Wijesundaran Mawatha. Shows are normally held from Tuesday to Saturday at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. In March 2018, the planetarium also began running free shows on Sundays, although it's best to confirm that in advance. Regular ticket prices are less than $1 US."

The pool is the only recognizable feature of the palace that has survived the test of time, and it remains remarkably intact and a thing of architectural beauty. The steps used to enter the pool and the channels through which water flowed in out are still visible, as is a remarkably well-preserved urinal, the artistry of which suggests this used to be part of a wealthy palace.","The site is located along the A4 highway, marked by a sign along the road."

The marsh is home to remarkable bird life, a large population of monitor lizards, numerous species of snakes, and an important cadre of rare fish. All this without leaving the city. Fish species in the marsh and adjoining canal include the endangered Golden Raspbora and Red Barb. As for the birds, expect to see Pelican, Ibis, Purple Coot, Kingfishers, Grebes, and Cormorants as a matter of course, and potentially Red Wattled Lapwing, Ashy Prinia, and Common Babbler. Watch out for the spectacular show put on by fireflies. This unique wildlife corridor also occasionally allows saltwater crocodiles into the heart of the populated area. The marsh is located along the Kinda Canal, one of the water bodies in the Colombo region that were joined together by Dutch engineers in the 18th century to form a series of canals. These canals were plied by flat-bottomed, human-hauled Padda Boats. Today the waterways are maintained for the purposes of drainage, and the authorities are toiling to control the spread of water hyacinth, an invasive species threatening this unique local ecosystem.","Rajagiriya is a suburb on the southeastern border of Colombo, in Sri Lanka’s official administrative capital, Sri Jayawardenapura. To reach the marsh from Rajagiriya, go down Lake Drive to Lake Gardens, past the Royal Park Condominiums, then take the last bridge over the Kinda Canal onto a small island."

Isipathanaramaya is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Colombo, built in 1916 by a wealthy merchant to grieve the loss of his only son, who was executed by the British based on false accusations. The colonial temple’s wonderful architecture and artwork would assure that the young man’s name was remembered throughout the century to come. The bright white domed structure hides a burst of colorful statues and painted murals inside. Created by a renowned artist in the 1920s, the beautiful and well-preserved frescos depict the life of Buddha in a stylized fashion that was quite unique for the time. The temple also houses a lovely Bo Tree, and the recent addition of a 40-foot-tall Buddha statue. Isipathanaramaya is the local temple in Havelock Town (Colombo 5), located just far enough south to be off the tourist track. It’s a serene and peaceful place, a welcome respite from the bustle of Colombo.","Located in Colombo 5, most easily reached by tuk-tuk. Open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with a $1 entry fee. Note that this is an active temple frequented by locals who come here to meditate and pray."
29,Kilinochchi Water Tower,"Kilinochchi, Sri Lanka",A massive fallen water tank bombed by the Tamil Tigers in the final stages of the long Sri Lankan Civil War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kilinochchi-water-tower,"The city of Kilinochchi used to be the de facto capital Vanni (or Wanni), a swath of territory in the North of Sri Lanka that was controlled by the militant LTTE organization (Liberation Tigers Tamil Eelam), also known as the Tamil Tigers. The city’s size increased and decreased through 30 years of civil war fought by the insurgent group and the Sri Lankan Army. Toward the end of the war in 2008, shortly before the Army regained control and liberated Kilinochchi, an LTTE contingent bombed the water tower that provided water to the whole city. To see it today the size of the fallen tower is daunting, especially so because it now lies on the ground, dwarfing the nearby buildings. The A9 road, which links the North and the South of Sri Lanka, cuts right through Kilinochchi.  The city has by and large recovered from the war, or at least its infrastructure has, but the destroyed water tower remains; in 2014 it was fenced off and turned into a monument, a stark reminder of what the civil war left behind. Traveling in a northbound direction, the water tower is on the righthand side of the road. Given its size, it is all but impossible to miss.",
30,Mackwoods Tea Plantation Sign,"Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka",A Sri Lankan tea factory's ironic take on the Los Angeles landmark.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mackwoods-tea-plantation-sign,"If you want to see how tea is grown, picked, and processed, Sri Lanka is the place to go. Many tea plantations in the country offer guided visits, which include walks through the tea fields, tours of the factories, and in many cases, complimentary tea tastings. But the Mackwoods Labookellie Tea Centre tis probably the most famous of the plantations—not because of its tea museum, but because of its ironic take on the Hollywood sign. The massive white letters of the “Mackwoods” sign can be seen for miles around, and the sign is one of the most photographed features in the highland region of Sri Lanka. The Tea Centre, located in the heart of the tea plantation area between Nuwara Eliya and Kandy, is at an elevation of about 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) and, like its counterpart in Los Angeles, the sign is situated high in the hills. Update as of April 2020: A new company has taken over the Mackwoods plantation and replaced the sign with their own logo.","The Mackwoods museum tells much of the plantation's story, but a factory tour, usually available on request, is even more enlightening. The Tea Centre can get very busy during Sri Lankan holiday periods. You can take on a local bus from the bus station in the centre of Nuwara Eliya. There is a bus stop with a ‘Labookellie’ sign above it and a small bus takes you there. Buses are pretty regular and very cheap. If you tell the conductor where you want to get off the bus he will tell you when you get to the right stop. If you decide to travel by train to Nuwara Eliya from Colombo it is only about £5 for a first class (air conditioned) ticket to the nearest station Nanu Oya (about a 15 minute tuc tuc ride from the town centre) but 2nd class is a lot cheaper and the windows open so you get a better view. Even for second class you need to book in advance. Fantastic train journey particulate after you pass Kandy and much of that has a 15mph speed limit so you get plenty of time to take in the views."
31,Gangaramaya Vihara Temple,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Why is there a vintage Rolls Royce in this Buddhist temple?,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grangaramaya-vihara-temple,"The Gangaramaya Vihara Temple is an unusual mix of a Buddhist temple and a museum, home to not only a number of vintage cars but an enormous amount of materials of dubious religious relevance, including gold, sapphires, sandalwood, elephant ivory, porcelain, Chinese statues, a cannon, stamps, watches, cameras, photographs, coins, two taxidermied elephants, stereos, shells, swords and other assorted knick-knacks.  Many of these items were gifts to the temple. There is also a lot of specifically religious material, including a massive sacred tree in the centre of the complex. Nearby is the temple’s most sacred relic, said to be a lock of the Buddha’s hair donated from a temple in Bengal. The main religious event held here is the Nevam Perahara procession held on the poya day (full moon) every February. Hundreds of monks take part in the procession in which sacred relics are carried in a casket on the back of a highly decorated elephant. After receiving criticism for keeping a captive elephant that was used for religious ceremonies, the temple removed the elephant from public display.",Women should ensure they are appropriately dressed with legs and shoulders covered. Shawls are provided to cover exposed shoulders/legs if needed. Photography is forbidden inside the temple itself. Entrance is 300 rupees. In the region around the Colombo Fort railway station you may be approached by people who seem to be very helpful and offer to take you on a tour to the temple. You will probably be ripped off if you get into a non-metered Tuk Tuk with them.
32,Sambodhi Chaithya,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",This space rocket-like Buddhist stupa sits atop two giant arches and can be seen from out at sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sambodhi-chaithya,"Sambodhi Chaithya is a huge bell-shaped Buddhist stupa in Colombo Harbour, Sri Lanka. Unlike most stupas, it has the distinction of standing on two massive diagonally interlocking arches, allowing the shrine to be seen from out at sea. In 1953, the Most Venerable Henpitagedara Gnanaseeha Thero decided that Colombo should have a Buddhist landmark that could be seen by anyone approaching the Port of Colombo by sea. The renowned Sri Lankan engineer A. N. S. Kulasinghe was chosen to design and build the structure, and construction began in 1956. Kulasinghe’s design was something truly unique. Imagine Cape Canaveral, but with a giant retro Buddhist space rocket about to launch to Alpha Centauri, and you won’t be far off. The white, bell-shaped stupa, or chaitya (a combination of a stupa and a preaching hall), stands on a large platform held aloft on two giant diagonally interlocking arches. The structure rises above the cranes and buildings in the nearby port, clearly visible to anyone out at sea. The entire structure is 261 feet (80 meters) tall. The interlocking arches rise up to a height of 107 feet (33 meters), on which stands the main platform, which is itself a one-story building. On top of this stands the stupa, with a circumference of 158 feet (48 meters). Adding to the space-rocket launchpad effect is the access tower that runs alongside the main structure. Reaching 11 stories high and with 258 steps, the tower is connected to the platform below the stupa via a metal walkway. Once inside, you’ll find yourself beneath the huge dome of the stupa. In the center of the circular floor sits a shrine with four recessed Buddha statues. Along the walls of the dome are a series of 31 murals created by the Venerable Mapalagama Wipulasara Maha Thera (1925-2000), a Theravada Buddhist monk and acclaimed Sri Lankan artist. These murals depict scenes from the life of the Buddha, and Buddhist sites in Sri Lanka. Up on the walls above the murals are four statues at the cardinal points. These figures are the guardian gods of the island and protectors of Buddhism: Viruta, chief of the South; Virupashta, chief of the West; Vaishravana, chief of the North; and Dutharashta, chief of the East.","Sambodhi Chaithya is located at the end of Chaithya Road, past the Colombo Lighthouse. It's open from early in the morning until 6 p.m. Entrance is free. You'll have to take your shoes off when climbing the steps to the stupa and inside the stupa itself. The concrete steps of the access tower can get very hot during the heat of the day, so to avoid scorching your feet it's best to go in the early morning or late afternoon. Once you've finished visiting the stupa, it's worth spending some time exploring the grounds below it. Here you'll find a bo tree planted by former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka Sirimavo Bandaranaike (the world’s first elected female prime minister). Also scattered around the grounds are old cannons, anchors and a vintage steam crane. And just next to Sambodhi Chaithya is the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Maritime Museum."

Though the exact origin of this sculpture is not known, there are many theories and local stories about where it came from. Some local legends tell a story of a foreign king, while other stories say it was a prince, who suffered from a severe skin disease (kushta in Singhalese). He came to hide in Weligama Bay and was then cured by a local doctor. As a sign of his gratitude, the royal carved a statue of himself and left. (It is argued that if the story is true the king should have carved a statue of the doctor.) Another version of the story talks about how this sick king or prince made an offering to the god Natha, who appears in many forms. Once he was cured, he made a statue of Natha as a gift. These stories were told in ancient times when Weligama was used as a harbor by foreign trading ships, meaning the rock could have been there before they arrived. Archaeologists and historians believe that the statue depicts a Bodhisattva, a person who is destined to reach nirvana. This is due to the presence of four meditating Buddha figures on the headdress and a lotus in the hand. Most maintain that it is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, from Mahayana Buddhism, thought to be the most powerful healers of mankind. This theory is based on two ideas: First, because of the local stories about the king/prince being healed; and second because of similar carvings found in the Wellawaya area called Buduruwagala Raja Maha Viharaya, which is located to the northeast. Details of the statue have led archaeologists to believe that it dates back to the seventh or eighth century. Regardless of any belief, this statue is the only remaining preserved statue in this area and locals still come to worship this statue to request relief from diseases.",Open always.

34,Galle Fort,"Galle, Sri Lanka","This fort dates back to 1588 and was colonized by the Portuguese, Dutch, and English and sits prominently on the Indian Ocean where azure water lap the coast.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/galle-fort,"The city of Galle in Sri Lanka is perfect for walking and taking in architecture from the past three centuries. A fort on the Bay of Galle was established by Portuguese colonizers in 1588, then extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century. The fort resembles a small walled town with streets in a rectangular grid pattern and low houses in the Dutch colonial style. Inside the fort area there are a number of historic churches, mosques, commercial and government buildings. Make sure to try egg and string hoppers for breakfast and visit one of the local beaches in Unawatuna or Welligama.",Since you'll probably be traveling south to Galle from Colombo there are two options: the train with a view of the local villages and the sea or a private driver. I would not recommend renting a car or driving in Sri Lanka as it may be hazardous to your health and peace of mind. Leave the driving to the professionals.
35,Baobab Tree Pallimunai,"Mannar, Sri Lanka","The trunk of this 700-year-old tree measures more than 60 feet around, making it the oldest and largest baobab in Sri Lanka.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baobab-tree-pallimunai-mannar,"There is something special about having a tree as the main thing that draws people to a place. The island of Mannar in Sri Lanka is one of the few spots that can make that claim. The island has a long history of pearl fishing that dates back to at least the second century. Mannar came to be renowned for its pearls, among other resources, and its location on a thriving trade route attracted merchants from Europe and the Middle East. Oral history has it that an Arab merchant brought with him a herd of camels and a supply of baobab fruit as fodder on the shores of Mannar. A seed from this fruit fell on the ground. It took roots and a tree sprouted. More than 700 years later, the tree measures a respectable 7.5 meters (25 feet) in height and an impressive 19.5 meters (64 feet) in circumference. While the tree’s true origin may be impossible to ascertain, there may be a grain of truth to this story. This baobab belongs to the scientific family Bombacaceae, which is native to Africa, and Arab merchants traveled extensively along the East African coast in the 13th century. Baobabs used to be cultivated around Jaffna and Puttlam, but there are only 40 baobabs in the entire country now, 34 of which are found on Mannar Island. Needless to say, this particular specimen in Mannar is the most famous. Because of their grey, gnarled bark, baobabs are often referred to as ali gaha, or elephant trees, by locals. Interestingly, though baobabs are not native to Sri Lanka, they have been declared a protected species. One final curiosity: each baobab fruit contains 30 seeds. Christians in Mannar sometimes refer to this tree as “Judas’ bag” due to the fact that Judas betrayed Jesus in exchange of 30 pieces of silver.",The baobab of Mannar is located 1.2 km northeast of town centre.
36,Tsunami Memorial at Yala National Park,"Hambantota, Sri Lanka","Only the foundation remains of the rest stop building that was hit by three large tsunami waves, killing 47 visitors.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tsunami-memorial-at-yala-national-park,"Safari visitors to Yala National Park in Sri Lanka can only tour the grounds with a guide and in a car, and there are only a few designated places where you can stop and get out of vehicle for a snack and drink. One of those stops is at the Patangala Rest House—or now, what’s left of it. The Patangala Rest House house was destroyed during the tsunami that devastated the Sri Lankan coast on Boxing Day, 2004. On December 26th, three large tsunami waves hit the remote beach in the south of Sri Lanka, flooding the middle of the national park where the rest house was located, and killing 47 visitors that were stopped there. The coasts in the east and south of Sri Lanka were heavily struck by the tsunami, killing 30,000 to 35,000 total people in the country. Only the foundation of the rest house remains. In its place there’s a memorial, commemorating the 47 people that were killed on the site—15 Japanese and German tourists, and 29 local visitors, according to the monument’s stone inscription. The sculpture represents the three tsunami waves that struck the area, and the level of water after the tsunami.","To get to the memorial you’ll have to be on one of the safaris in the park; otherwise it’s not possible to visit. Most of the safari jeeps will stop at the memorial. The safaris in the park are enjoyable anyway, with a chance of spotting elephants, leopards and bears."
37,Kayman’s Gate Bell Tower,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",A neglected bell tower in modern Colombo is a symbol of the city's colonial past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaymans-gate-bell-tower,"Now largely neglected and overlooked by most passersby, the Kayman’s Gate Bell Tower in the Pettah district is a symbol of Colombo’s colonial history. The free-standing bell tower was built by the Portuguese in 1554 and later served as the site of public hangings. During Colombo’s Portuguese era, Kayman’s Gate served as the east entrance to Colombo Fort, built to protect colonial trading interests in the city. When needed, a drawbridge was lowered from the gate, connecting the fort with the outskirts of the city. Outside the gate lay St. John’s River, in reality, a canal connected to Beira Lake, into which much of the fort’s waste was dumped. This attracted the lake’s crocodiles, who swam up the canal to feed on the waste. When the fort was captured by the Dutch in 1656, Colombo’s new colonial overlords named the east entrance Kayman’s Gate after the crocodiles (kaaiman in Dutch) that swam in the canal. During the Dutch period, the Kayman’s Gate bell tower was rebuilt and a new bell hung from the belfry. The bell likely came from a church in the Royal Kingdom of Kotte in Sri Lanka, abandoned in 1565 and later occupied by the Dutch. When the Dutch found the bell in the ruins of a church, they took it to Colombo and hung it in the new bell tower. The bell, which still hangs in the tower today, is inscribed with “Ave gratia plena dominus tecum benadicta tu in mulieribus,” or “Hail full of grace the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women.” During the Dutch period, the bell was used to sound out the closing of the fort gates and to announce the nightly curfew. Colombo was captured by the British in 1796, who took Pettah after breaching Kayman’s Gate. Under British occupation, the fort was all but leveled. Its walls, barricades, canals, and moats were demolished or filled in. Kayman’s Gate was demolished too, but the bell tower was kept in place to call the congregation to services at Wolvendaal Church. It was also used as the site of a far darker practice: up until the late 19th Century, the immediate area on which the bell tower now stands was used for public hangings.","Kayman’s Gate Bell Tower is located near a busy street corner at the intersection of Main and 4th Cross Street, in a ramshackle and often chaotic part of Pettah. Tucked away behind street stalls and a wire fence, and back-dropped by a bare concrete wall, it would be easy to miss if you didn't know of its existence. It's also largely neglected, and barely registers as a tourist attraction. That said, it remains an intriguing symbol of Colombo's colonial past and its history of foreign occupiers."
38,Sea Tigers Submarine Yard,"Puthukkudiyiruppu, Sri Lanka",Remains of military submarines built in secret jungle factories by the Tamil guerrillas' naval wing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sea-tigers-submarine-yard,"These submarines wouldn’t be out of place in a 1950s sci-fi flick, but in fact, they are warzone remnants of the long and bloody Sri Lankan Civil War. These deserted vessels were homemade in secret in makeshift factories in Tamil Tiger-occupied territory by the rebels’ naval wing. The Mullaitivu district on Sri Lanka’s northeastern coast was the site of the naval base of the LTTE, Liberation Tigers Tamil Eelam, aka Tamil Tigers. The harbor here served as the headquarters of the so-called Sea Tigers, the formidable naval wing of the insurgent operation. Among their various ambitious activities, the Sea Tigers engineers built a number of submarines. In 2009, as Sri Lankan government troops were advancing deeper into Tiger-held northern territory shortly before the end of the war, troops made a startling and key discovery. They stumbled on a deserted submarine boatyard near Puthukkudiyiruppu in the country’s Mullaitivu district, where Sea Tigers were manufacturing secret underwater vessels. As the Tigers retreated further into the jungle during the government’s final push against the LTTE,  the rebels left ghost camps behind, including this crude submarine workshop. In the boatyard, the Sri Lankan Army discovered four submersibles and semisubmersibles. (Finding true submarines was rare, as they very difficult to build.) This included three terrorist suicide boats in mid-construction and unused, a crudely built mini-sub, and an unfinished steel hull of a larger submarine. What the larger one was supposed to be used for, however, is unknown. As the LTTE grew from a guerrilla movement to more sophisticated they built up a strategically vital naval wing, the Sea Tigers, which constructed, in secret in the jungle in Tiger territory, a range of novel, experimental vessels. They made up for their lack of open ocean capability with innovative boats like explosive suicide vessels and crude submarines. Some of the unconventional designs were ineffective but others were substantial. Others are so unusual it’s unclear how they were planned to be used, and there is ongoing research attempts to make sense of the Sea Tiger’s homemade fleet.",
39,Wanli UFO Village,"New Taipei City, Taiwan",A rare pod of derelict midcentury Futuro and Venturo houses lines a semi-abandoned beachfront resort outside Taipei.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wanli-ufo-village,"Mystery surrounds this semi-abandoned holiday resort, home to the last pod of Futuro—a.k.a “UFO”—houses in Taiwan, as well as what may be the largest pod of Venturo houses in the world. The eerie streets of this abandoned beachside paradise still echo with the cries of surfers fighting against the strong coastal waves from the village’s bygone days as a hub of midcentury futurism. The Futuro houses, designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, resemble whimsical flying saucers. The pre-fabricated plastic oddities were originally designed as ski chalets light enough to be airlifted onto any terrain, although the ones at Wanli swapped the adjustable UFO-style legs for tacky ’70s-era pebble-concrete staircases. The UFO-shaped house closest to the entrance of the park boasts a fully functioning airplane-style door and windows; inside the small circular space are a sitting area, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. (Other Futuros farther into the park have been less well-preserved, although one nearly hidden example seems to be in continuous occupation as part of a much larger building.) This particular pod, comprising about six Futuros, is scattered throughout a large complex of Venturo Houses, another retrofuturistic pre-fab house model by the same architect. Unlike the Futuro, the Venturo never really took off in its own era, and hasn’t experienced the same resurgence of popular interest. Reportedly less than 10 “true” Venturos exist in the world—but there are more than 10 in this park alone! That’s where the mystery comes in: These dwellings do not appear to have been sanctioned by Suuronen himself, and there doesn’t seem to be any publicly accessible information as to where they came from, or even exactly when they were built.",

Every day Grandpa Rainbow paints a little more and more, bringing the village’s rundown surfaces back to life with his vibrant colors and characters, and giving it the name “Rainbow Family Village”. Depending on whom you are talking to, Grandpa Rainbow either started painting because he was bored and wanted to brighten up his drab surroundings, or it was to save his village from demolition by the government. No matter the backstory, the village has become something of an out-of-the-way tourist destination.

During its height, Houtong encompassed around 900 households, fostering a population of around 6,000 people. Yet by the 1970s the town’s fortunes began to fall into decline. As is often the case in such situations, the younger residents of the town quickly began leaving for greener pastures and opportunities in the bigger cities. By the 1990s, the mining industry had died off in the area completely, and the population of the village had dwindled to less than 100 people. Most villages in this situation would have simply fallen off the face of the Earth, but luckily for Houtong, it received a little feline salvation. By 2008, the tiny village had accumulated dozens of stray cats that nearly outnumbered the humans. Seeing this as an opportunity to inject a little life into their town, the human inhabitants began advertising themselves on the internet as a cat-friendly sanctuary, where visitors could come and commiserate with the meowing mousers that had control of the streets. The image stuck, and today Houtong is a fairly popular tourist destination that sees people train in from all over to see the cats (now numbering over 100) that freely roam the area. Shops selling cat paraphernalia and the like have sprung up, but the true draw is still the beasts themselves.","From Taipei Main Train Station, take the TRA to Rui Fang Station, then change train to go to Houtong Station."
42,The Dome of Light,"Xinxing District, Taiwan",The world’s largest work of glass art hides in this stunning Taiwanese subway station.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-dome-of-light-xinxing-district-taiwan,"At the intersection of Kaohsiung’s Red and Orange metro lines, the history of the universe plays out on giant dome of illuminated glass. Built by Italian artist Narcissus Quagliata, the Dome of Light also commemorates the harrowing birth of Taiwan’s democracy. Despite its location at Kaohsiung’s busiest metro stop, the Dome of Light holds the solemnity of a cathedral. The dome is an impressive 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter and is made of 4,500 glass panels, making it the largest work of glass art in the world. The installation took Quagliata four and a half years to complete and has led some to call Formosa Boulevard one of the world’s most beautiful subway stations. Each of the dome’s four quadrants highlights themes from the lifecycle of the cosmos, humanity, and Taiwan’s own tumultuous political history. The imagery moves through periods of painful growth and inevitable destruction, but the overall message echoes with hope and rebirth. Although Taiwan is now considered one of the most legitimate democracies in Asia (second only to Japan and South Korea), its political history is defined by violence and oppression under a one-party state. Beginning with the February 28 massacre in 1947, a 38-year period of martial law saw tens of thousands of political dissidents imprisoned or executed. Things began to shift on December 10, 1979, when a pro-democracy demonstration and celebration of Human Rights Day descended into police-instigated violence. The events of the protest helped unite government opposition and marked a turning point in Taiwan’s democratization. Known as the Formosa Incident, the protests took place near the present-day Formosa Boulevard Station where the Dome of Light is installed. At street level, the Formosa Boulevard Station is just as remarkable. The four main entrances were designed by Japanese architect Shin Takamatsu. Their curved shape and orientation towards one another is thought to be symbolic of hands clasped in prayer—perhaps seeking redemption for the past or wishing for continued peace in the future.","The Dome of Light can be found in the B1 level of the Formosa Boulevard Station, where the Kaohsiung MRT Red Line and Orange Line intersect."

Once the land of the indigenous Truko people, in whose language Taroko means “magnificent and beautiful,” the land was recreated as a national park by the Taiwanese government in 1986. Driven out by the Japanese in 1914, today the only remains of the Truko people in Taroko National park are the ruins of the 120-year-old Tupido Tribe Trail on the Tianhsyang mesa. The picturesque Eternal Spring Shrine has been rebuilt twice following landslides, and remembers the 212 who died during the construction of the Central Cross-Island Highway. The Tunnel of Nine Turns follows a particularly dramatic series of tight turns along the narrow gorge.

Named after the waterfall that runs beneath it year round, the beautiful little temple was built in the late 1950s while the nearby Cross-Island Highway was still under construction. The road was built by Taiwanese veterans and tragically over 200 of them perished during the effort. These brave workers are remembered by a small temple and adjoining pavilion that are connected by the bridge spanning the titular falls, all of which makes up the shrine complex. Visitors to the shrine who are willing to do a little exploring will find a number of wonders hidden behind the shrine as well including a cave with statues of a handful of Taoist gods, and trails leading to more secluded towers and sites hidden among the natural features. The shrine has been damaged and nearly destroyed a couple of times due to landslides on its verdant mountainside, but each time, the site has been rebuilt and continues to stand as a beautiful monument to the human cost of progress.","Situated on a cliffside in Taroko National Park in Taiwan, in Hualien County near town of Xiulin."

Stabbing out into the East China Sea, the thin spit of land now known as a “geopark” is awash in all manner of sculpted rock formations. The most well-known shapes are the top-heavy hoodoos that act as the symbol of the park, but there are a wide variety of shapes that have been etched into the land across the centuries. The unique landscape is the result of wind and waves crashing over the thin spike of earth, coming from the sea on almost every side. Many of these natural stone forms have even been given fanciful pet names like the oft-photographed, “Queen’s Head.” In the park you can also find formations called the “The Fairy Shoe,” and “The Sea Candles.” In addition the to the stunning geological wonders in the geopark, the other increasingly common sight are the throngs of tourists that have begun flocking to the site. Unfortunately, like the wind and water that shaped the bulbous vistas, the very presence of so many humans is beginning to shape the land as well. Popular sites like the “Queen’s Head” have become so overrun that bright lines have been painted on the ground to keep anyone from disturbing the delicate rocks.

Essentially acting as a giant pendulum, the enormous steel sphere moves slightly back and forth to counter any motion of the building itself. It is an engineering marvel meant to limit the vibrations of the 1,667-foot tall building. The 18-foot diameter, 660- metric ton steel sphere is suspended by eight cables in the upper stories of the tower, and is visible between the 88th and 92nd floors. The Taipei 101 Tuned Mass Damping were built and tested by A&H Custom Machine. The fabrication of the components took approximately a year to complete. As one of the tallest structures in the world, located only 660 feet from a major fault line, earthquakes and high winds are a serious threat. In fact, visitors even caught a glimpse of the tuned mass damper in action during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Many skyscrapers contain tuned mass dampers to restrain sway, and as the tops of the tallest buildings can move several feet in the wind, a tuned mass damper or similar mechanism is often necessary for maintaining structural integrity. At Taipei 101, the room-sized device is capable of moving five feet in any direction, thereby reducing sway by 30 to 40 percent.

Located in the southwest of Lotus Lake and completed in 1953 just two years after the man-made lake itself, the Spring and Autumn Pavilions are a pair of traditionally ornate palace towers that are separated by large dragon being ridden by a god. The two massive pavilions are dedicated to a God of War, known (among many other spellings) as Kuan Kung. The two devotional buildings are separated by a giant dragon statue that itself has the statue of a large figure on its back. This was inspired by the tale of the Goddess of Mercy, Kuanyin, riding a dragon through the sky, symbolically separating Spring and Autumn. Visitors can enter the pavilions through the dragon’s mouth. A ways south of the pavilions along the lakeshore are the much taller Dragon and Tiger Pagodas which were completed in 1978. This twin-spired temple consists of a duo of seven-story pagoda towers which are attended by giant versions of their respective beast.

In actuality this strange building is a church meant to cater to women. Or to reference a local legend. Or something. Finished in early 2016, the giant shoe church is an all-glass structure, formed out of 320 blue-tinted panes, set into a metal grid. The main worship space is held in the toe with a large screen at the tip, while there is an outdoor stage built into the collar where someone’s giant foot might go. While it is being called a church, officials say that its main function will be to cater to weddings and photo shoots. In addition to its questionably female-centric architecture, the interior of the worship shoe is said to include over 100 features that women will like, including love seat benches, biscuits and cakes, and maple leaf decorations. Before anyone gets to thinking that all of this is just to pander to women, there is a second, more traditional  reasoning behind the design of the church. Apparently it is actually an allusion to a local story of a girl who caught Blackfoot. As the story goes, this local girl contracted the disease and had to have the lower portions of her legs amputated, ending her engagement, and resulting in her spending the rest of her days alone and living in a church.

But even more recently the park has branched out into teaching guests about how awesome roller coasters can be. Originally built in 1986, the culture park stands as Taiwan’s largest outdoor museum, consisting of nine separate village reconstructions and a traditional European garden. Each of the villages was meant to represent a different tribal culture from the area and were created based on ethnographic illustrations from the early 20th century. In addition to the traditional architectural flourishes throughout the park, traditional dances, crafts, and other authentic demonstrations are regularly performed. Notably, all of the performers in the park are Indigenous people. The Taiwanese government currently recognizes 16 aboriginal tribes. Years of conflict and colonization have greatly reduced the country’s Indigenous population and culture–out of 26 known Formosan languages, 10 have been declared extinct, while the remaining languages are in danger of disappearing completely. Lest the exploration of a rich and varied culture that may soon fade from memory in the coming century become a bit stale or boring for younger visitors, a new section of the park was built in 1992, called Amusement Isle. Maintaining the cultural flavor of the more educational portions of the park, the exciting new isle contains a collection of roller coasters and adrenaline engines including Taiwan’s tallest free-fall drop ride.

In the years since the site was abandoned, the living banyan tree has forced its way through, over, and across the brickwork and concrete. Remarkably, the sprawling roots and branches have excellently preserved the shape of walls, doorways, and roofs that have long since fallen down and been removed. An elevated walkway has been added to the grounds, which allows visitors to navigate the rooms of the Anping Tree House, as it has been dubbed, without too much interruption from the tangled tree roots that hang everywhere. Still, you may need to duck under a few invasive branches as you climb the stairs to explore this wonderfully unusual sight.",You'll find the Anping Tree House just north of Anping Fort and the very popular street market that runs alongside it.
54,100-Year Bomb Shelter,"Ren’ai District, Taiwan",A secret passageway from World War II is now a quirky pedestrian shortcut.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/100-year-bomb-shelter,"Hidden behind a railway line is a hidden passageway that tourists in Keelung wouldn’t think to wander through. Only a small, nondescript sign hanging above its short entrance hints at its significant history. The tunnel was built by the Japanese in 1903 (Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945) and is now referred to as the “100-Year Bomb Shelter.” This portal into the city’s underbelly was a refuge for those seeking shelter from the bombs dropped by American forces during World War II. In addition to acting as a long, narrow bomb shelter, the tunnel was also used as an ammunition depot. Now, it serves a far less risky purpose. As it’s concealed within a bustling area, locals have begun using it as an underground shortcut while going to-and-fro. It lets them enter the hillside from one neighborhood and pop out in another, without having to deal with any crowds. Some guides have also started including it as a quirky, off-the-beaten path stop on tours of the city.",You won't see many tourist in Keelung but it's an interesting city. Bring an umbrella as it rains a lot!
55,Grand Matsu Temple,"Tainan City, Taiwan",Only through deep darkness and tragedy did this elaborate royal palace become a sacred temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grand-matsu-temple,"The goddess Matsu ranks among one of the most important deities in Taiwan, thanks to the protection she offered during the perilous journey from the mainland to Taiwan. An estimated 4-500 temples exist in Taiwan devoted to Matsu alone, yet one of the most sacred of all sits in downtown Tainan City. Inside the Grand Matsu Temple, rooms upon rooms contain shrines to various deities, especially in back of the main hall. The most prominent of all is a large golden one in the middle representing Matsu herself. Two tall monster-like statues on either side represent Matsu’s servants, Qianli Yuan and Xufong Er. Legend has it that these two creatures were monsters that Matsu subdued and converted to do good, helping her to patrol the seas and help sailors. Visitors and devotees wandering the main hall could peruse the wide variety of deities on display without detecting a single trace of the tragedy and darkness that once transpired inside these very walls, when the holy temple had been a princely palace. For, in the years before Grand Matsu Temple became one of the most sacred temples in the country, it had been a royal palace. Zheng Chenggong’s son, Zheng Jing, commissioned the building in 1664 for the Prince of Ningjing after inviting the young Ming princeling to take up residency in Taiwan, having no idea the dark turn of events about to befall all who resided there. It was here, in the palace-slash-proto-temple, that the prince decided to take his own life. Following suit, in the main hall of the building where the giant gilded Matsu reigns today, the prince’s five concubines hanged themselves from a wood beam. Only later, after the Qing took over Taiwan and General Shi Lang took up residency in the palace, did he petition his emperor to have the building converted into a temple dedicated to Matsu, making the Grand Matsu Temple of Tainan the country’s first officially dedicated Matsu temple in Taiwan. And only those who know the dark history behind the place know why.","The temple is located in the Chikan Lou Cultural Zone, but it’s not easily visible. It’s tucked behind some buildings that run along the south side of Minzu Road between Yongfu and Ximen."
56,Painted Animation Lane,"Taichung City, Taiwan",A small alleyway lined with locally drawn scenes of nostalgic anime and cartoon characters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/painted-animation-lane,"Taichung City is generally known for its food, but it’s also more quietly known for its colorful art scene. And this particular little nook located in the heart of the city is a great place for an evening stroll or photobombing opportunity with some of your favorite animated characters. Walk through this street art alleyway, which has been dubbed Painted Animation Lane, and you’ll come across some familiar faces from manga, anime, and cartoon classics: Super Mario, Luigi, Goku, Vegeta, Naruto, and more. The walls on both sides of the narrow street are painted, so a stroll through the alley is like a literal trip down memory lane. The walkway is short, which it means won’t take up too much out of your day, but is worth a stop for anime and cartoon fans. There are also nearby stores offering cool souvenirs and snacks you can take home with you.","Certain parts of the lane are well lit but others are not, so it's best to visit during the day."
57,Rixing Type Foundry,"Taipei City, Taiwan",Taiwan's last Chinese character letterpress preserves the dying art of Chinese character mold making.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rixing-type-foundry,"Ever thought about how newspapers printed in Chinese were produced in the pre-digital era? Every word, every character needed to be on stock for printing. And here, in the middle of Taipei, these characters are still produced with molten lead. Rixing Type Foundry is the last Chinese character type manufacturer in Taiwan. This rare typographic gem manufactures and sells traditional Chinese movable type character, and may well be the last Chinese type foundry in the world. The foundry boasts about 120,000 different molds. The molds will produce three distinct typefaces in multiple fonts. Rows of wooden shelves fill the space, each stacked with different fonts. In the back, you’ll see a room full of different molding and casting machines used to create the type. Chang Chien-Kuan, the owner, is the driving force behind the foundry’s success. His work is tedious and time-consuming, but he spends each day repairing the old molds. Chien-Kuan is a master practitioner of Chinese letterpress printing but sadly has not found anyone to pass his knowledge down to. His dedication and skills are what keeps the foundry—and the practice as a whole—from fading into the past.",It's not far from Taipei Main Station. There's a nice vintage stationery shop also worth checking out just opposite.
58,Leaning Mailboxes,"Taipei City, Taiwan",These charming mailboxes became social media stars after a typhoon failed to topple them.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leaning-mailboxes,"In 2015, Typhoon Soudelor hit Southeast Asia, drenching certain regions with high levels of rain and battering the land with fierce winds. A total of 59 people perished, and the damage cost an estimated 3.72 billion USD. But in Taiwan, the typhoon created not only havoc, but also a new roadside attraction. There, two ordinary red and green mailboxes were hit by a wind-blown billboard during the storm. They managed to survive the attack, though they now lean at a wonky angle. After the two resilient mailboxes were featured on national and international news, locals began queueing up to take pictures with the charming little structures. People staged photoshoots pretending to heave the crooked boxes back upright or act as though they’ll be crushed beneath them. Locals even named the beloved mailboxes “Little Red” and “Little Green.” After realizing how popular they were with the public, the Taiwanese National Mail decided not to replace them and instead left them as is. Incredibly, the mailboxes still accept letters. Anything that goes through these unusual mailboxes even gets marked with a special stamp.","Visitors heading to Taipei can find the two twisted mailboxes near the intersection of Nanjing East Road and Longjiang Road. The popular mailboxes have become a social media attraction, so it is advised to go earlier in the day to avoid crowds."
59,Fufudingshan Shell and Coral Temple,"New Taipei City, Taiwan",A Buddhist temple covered in intricate designs and carvings made out of seashells and pieces of coral.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fufudingshan-shell-and-coral-temple,"Over 60,000 meticulously strung together pieces of seashells and corals decorate this stunning underwater-themed temple in the hills of Taiwan. Instead of the usual lion-dog statues that preface more traditional temples, dragon head turtles are the guardians of the choice here. Located five miles from the sea, this shrine is an homage to the 18 disciples of Buddha, Matsu (the goddess of the sea), and a Buddhist monk named Ji Gong—a quirky monastic who drank profusely and ate a lot of meat, yet was an advocate for the poor. Taiwan is a place that embraces polytheism, and it’s quite common to see a multitude of deities housed peacefully in the same space. While there are over 15,000 temples spread across the island, this nautical sea shrine has a unique sense of quirkiness. Built in 1996, it took two years to complete the entire structure. The entrance is adorned with a long row of shell-beaded chandeliers, and the main attraction is a narrow five-foot-tall tunnel packed with bright white coral on all sides. Even the incense burners are graced with a thick layer of shell and coral stubs. There is a caveat though. With reef systems being decimated around the globe, the temple has drawn some controversy among conservationists. The environmental repercussions of this coral-jeweled pantheon is questionable, though staff have said that the corals are not of the endangered sort.",There’s no public transportation available. The best way to get to the temple is to hire a private driver.

63,Tengfeng Fish Ball Museum,"Taipei City, Taiwan","If you've ever wanted to learn about the history of Asian fish balls, this Taiwanese museum has you covered.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tengfeng-fish-ball-museum,"While they are not a staple of American diets, fish balls are a common snack across China, and one manufacturer of the food has opened a museum devoted singularly to educating visitors about the history and ecology surrounding the beloved treat. Traditionally fish balls are made of a fish paste mixed together with vegetables and spice which is then rolled into a ball and steamed or fried. The origins of the popular junk food can be traced back to overabundant fish catches that left fishermen with a bunch of meat they didn’t know what to do with, eventually grinding it all up and using the paste to create things like fish balls and fish crisps. The Teng feng Fish Ball company was started back in 1940 when a couple of war buddies began producing fish crisps around the same time that plastic bag technology was beginning to hit its stride, allowing their product to take advantage of the sealed containers. From there they began to expand into fish balls and are now a successful producer of fish paste products. Deciding to give back to the industry that brought them such success, the Tengfeng Fish Ball Museum was opened. Today the museum features displays on the production and environmental impact of creating their products, leading visitors through the various species of fish that contribute to their fish balls. There are also a number of pieces of production equipment on display as well as the opportunity to roll your own balls by hand.",
64,Yanshui Beehive Fireworks Festival,"Tainan City, Taiwan",A festival where people vie to be bombarded by exploding clusters of fireworks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yanshui-beehive-fireworks-festival,"While much of Asia believes red decorations or sky lanterns can bring good luck in the new year, locals in the Yanshui district of Tainan believe that the more times you’re hit by a rocket, the better. Fifteen days into the Chinese lunar calendar, on the evening of the Lantern Festival, the district launches millions of fireworks directly into eager crowds. Thousands don motorcycle helmets and protective gear, take a swig or two of liquid courage, and take to the streets for a chance to be battered by explosions. At this festival, nearly catching fire is considered a good thing. The festival begins with a parade of palanquins, each carrying a holy figurine. Giant cylinders known as beehives are stuffed with bottle rockets and placed every couple of yards along the parade route. As the parade inches through town, crowds rush to huddle around the beehives. Sirens wail to warn anyone with second thoughts, and then the hives are lit. Within moments, trails of light scream in all directions like a swarm of angry bees bursting from a nest. Flaming cardboard rolls ricochet off helmets, leave bruises, and explode at random inside the crowd. People will throw down their own rockets from apartment balconies above, contributing to the mayhem below. The blast lasts only a minute or two before culminating in a dazzling skyward fireworks display. The origins of this strange custom date back to the late 1800s, when a cholera epidemic ravaged the town for more than 20 years. The locals asked the Chinese god of war, Guan Gong, to ward off the disease. On the day of the Lantern Festival, firecrackers were set off along the road in the hopes of inviting Guan Gong to the village. The epidemic subsided, but the tradition continued—and grew. Today, one beehive can hold anywhere from 10,000 to several hundred thousand rockets. These can cost up to $2,000 to construct but the luck they bring is worth the cost. Far from being just a burn threat, a rocket trapped inside a helmet can cause temporary hearing loss or permanent blindness. Nevertheless, people from all across Taiwan continue to travel to Yanshui for a shot at some luck of their own.","The Yanshui Beehive Fireworks Festival occurs 15 days into the Chinese lunar calendar each year. It can be disorienting for outsiders, and public transport from Tainan City to Yanshui district is complicated. For the best possible experience, try to attend with someone who is a festival veteran. In addition, visitors who would like to come away with functioning sensory organs should plan to wear flame retardant clothes, a scarf, gloves, and a full face motorcycle helmet."

From 1949 to 1987, tens of thousands of political dissidents were imprisoned by the Chinese Nationalist Party, many on Green Island, where two prisons were built that have come to symbolize the political suppression during that period in Taiwan.

66,Luoshan Organic Tofu Farm,"Fuli Township, Taiwan",Learn to make this village's specialty: volcanic mud tofu.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/luoshan-organic-tofu-farm,"Tucked in the hills of one of Taiwan’s first organic farming villages, Luoshan Organic Tofu Farm gives visitors the chance to try making tofu from scratch. But there’s a secret ingredient: volcanic mud water. Contrary to how it might sound, volcanic mud pits are nothing like their magma-spewing counterparts. The pits form as gases such as methane and carbon dioxide push hot water and minerals out of the ground. The water that comes out is a natural source of magnesium chloride, which helps coagulate soy milk into tofu. These mud pools are scattered all around Luoshan, including one available for public viewing. There’s a trail to it from Luoshan Organic Tofu Farm, and it’s about a 10-minute walk. The family that owns Luoshan Organic Tofu Farm guides visitors through the process from soybean to volcanic mud tofu: grinding the soybean into milk, cooking it, coagulating it, and pressing it. Proprietor Lin Yih-Cheng converted the space from a bed and breakfast into a workshop in the early 1990s. While there are many tofu-adjacent businesses in the area, Lin’s is the most popular, so reservations are a must. The class is conducted in a cool and shaded outdoor annex of his home, surrounded by trees. After decades of leading classes, Lin leads many workshops and provides animated and detailed explanations on the coagulation process and stories about the surrounding village and town. There’s also a small plot behind the workshop where the family grows their own Taiwanese soybeans. The entire class takes about an hour, and attendees are free to eat what they make. The finished tofu is dressed with a kiss of wasabi and some sweet soy paste, and served with a side of warm, fresh soy milk. The family also has a small gift shop featuring homemade hot sauce, tofu pudding, and fermented tofu curds. Everything but volcanic mud tofu, unfortunately. It doesn’t travel well, so get your fill before you go.","Take the train to Fuli township and grab a taxi. It’s about a 20-minute-ride to the workshop and all the local cab drivers know where it is. The minimum group size for the class is four. Visit their Facebook page for contact information or email bignature58@gmail.com.

67,Grand Hotel Tunnel,"Taipei City, Taiwan",Air-raid tunnels hidden beneath this opulent hotel provided shelter and an escape route—and one of the world's longest slides.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grand-hotel-tunnel-taipei,"When the Republic of China general Chiang Kai-Shek retreated to Taiwan in 1949 and began plotting an eventual takeover of China, he wanted a place where he could impress his guests and host foreign dignitaries. So his wife Soong Mei-ling commissioned the Grand Hotel—a stunning 12-story building and one of the finest classical Chinese buildings in the world. Established in 1952, the hotel became a Taiwanese landmark with its gilded tiles and red vermilion columns. Standing at 87 meters (285 feet), it was the tallest building in Taiwan for a number of years. In 1995, a fire broke out and destroyed most of the roof and the upper floors. During the repair process, workers discovered a hidden feature tucked underneath the hotel—a two-prong tunnel system complemented with a 229-foot-long escape slide for those with disablities. There were also bomb-proof light bulbs to light the way. Built to accommodate up to 10,000 people, the tunnels are air-raid shelters that lead out to nearby parks, intended for government officials and important heads of state to escape during the event of war. Tight, claustrophobic, and meant to only accommodate one person at a time, the slide was at one point considered the longest in the world. For years, the tunnels have been largely closed to the public—save for an occasional private tour or two—but the hotel recently opened them up for guided tours. There are four time slots per day, and the tour itinerary takes guests through the tunnel as well as to the former residence of the hotel’s first general manager.","Reservations have to be made ahead of time; there are four showings a day, at 9:30 a.m., 11 a.m., 2:30 p.m., and 4 p.m. The tour is only in Chinese, so plan for a translator if necessary."
68,The Imperial Japanese Navy Fengshan Wireless Communications Station,"Fengshan District, Taiwan",This former military installation was turned into a discipline center by the Taiwanese Navy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-imperial-japanese-navy-fengshan-wireless-communications-station,"This site in Kaohsiung City’s Fengshan district had multiple masters. It was initially built by the Japanese Navy between 1917 and 1919 as one of three large-scale wireless telecommunication centers in the Pacific. It remained under Japanese control until the end of World War II, when Taiwan was reunited with the Republic of China. For much of the postwar period, the base was used as a detention facility referred to by some as “Fengshan Guest House.” Upon entering you can see a rectangular building that was first used as an office building, then converted into meeting and interrogation rooms. The Cruciform station, a smaller structure a few steps south, was used for telecommunications. There you can still find (non-functioning) mechanical and electrical equipment as well as air conditioning trenches. Access to the building is unrestricted, but visitors should be cautious as not all areas are safe. The site’s centerpiece is the main blockhouse. The building is fortified and looks more like a bunker than a functional building from the outside, with blast-resistant doors and windows and deep soil on the roof to protect from bombing by the Allied forces. During the Japanese use of the facilities, this building housed the main communication equipment, and was designated as the First Sending Telecommunication Station. During the Fengshan Guest House period, prisoners allegedly called it “the cave,” in reference to its size and the way it was built into a hill. In 2011, the former communications station and detention center was opened to the public. Taiwan’s Council for Cultural Affairs lists it as a national monument, and there is a small welcoming hut at the entrance.","The station is open from Tuesday to Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. There is no entrance fee, but visitors may be asked to sign a guestbook."
69,Treasure Hill,"Taipei City, Taiwan",This densely-packed cluster of buildings was saved from the wrecking ball and turned into an art community.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/treasure-hill-taipei,"On a hill in the middle of Taipei, near the Xindian River, there is a cluster of buildings so densely packed that it resembles a real-life version of the urban sprawl in Hayao Miyazaki’s Howl’s Moving Castle. Known as Treasure Hill, the cluster was once to be an illegal shantytown that housed over 200 military families in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, it is a community filled with art and artists. Because the buildings were so haphazardly constructed, it was met with a lot of opposition by the local city government, who wanted to demolish the entire thing and turn it into a park. Saving Treasure Hill was a controversial ask, but eventually a compromise was reached: the community was renovated and turned into an artist village. Today, Treasure Hill is an incubator for both international and local art. Only about two dozen families still reside in the area, while the rest of it has been converted into artist spaces with a handful of studios, residency programs, and a hostel. Fortunately, the town still proudly retains much of the original chaos that made it so charming. With winding alleyways and vegetation growing out the cracks, it’s a quaint place to just stroll around. There are large fortune-cookie statues in the open spaces, elaborate wall murals, boutique shops, and a handful of coffee shops to linger around in.","The closest MRT stop is Gongguan station, and it’s about a 10 minute walk from there."

In addition to a large seated statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, whose military guard is changed hourly, the hall features exhibits from the founding father’s life, a world-class performance hall, and elegant exhibition center with an area of around 10,000 square feet. It hosts art, film, and music performances and is sited in Chung-shan Square Park. Doctor Sun Yat-sen, born in 1866 into a Chinese peasant family in Kwangtung, China near the Portuguese colony of Macao, was educated as a medical doctor in Hawaii, Canton, China and Hong Kong. As the leader of China’s republican revolution he did much to inspire and organize the movement that overthrew the Manchu dynasty in 1911—a family of rulers that had reigned over China for nearly three hundred years. On January 1, 1912, Sun Yat-sen proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of China. A bitter power struggle in 1913 forced Sun Yat-sen to flee China to Japan. In 1916 he returned to Shanghai and reorganized his party, this time as the Chinese Kuomintang. He published several manifestos outlining his vision of the Chinese republic, and his political fortunes waxed and waned through several years of civil wars. Sun Yat-sen died in 1925 in Peking, China and was given a state funeral. His leadership position in the Kuomintang was eventually taken by his former military aide, General Chiang Kai-shek, who in 1949 fled to Taiwan after losing mainland China to the Chinese Communist Party led by Mao Zedong. Chiang Kai-shek led the Kuomintang in Taiwan until his death in 1975, and before his funeral his body laid in state in the newly-constructed Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.","Located near the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall metro station, in Chung-Shan Square Park."
