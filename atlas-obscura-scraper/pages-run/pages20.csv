0,Sarez Lake,"Rushon, Tajikistan",The largest dam in the world and the site of a potential disaster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarez-lake,"Sarez Lake is a mountain lake deep in the inaccessible Pamir Mountains of Central Tajikistan. The lake was created in 1911, when an earthquake, estimated at 7.0 at the Richter Scale, and a following landslide of 2.2 million cubic meters, created a huge natural barrier known as the Usoi Dam. At a height of 567 meters, it is the largest dam in the world, either natural or man-made. Thanks to its extremely remote location, it took more than a month before local authorities became aware of the creation of this huge dam, which successively allowed the valley to be flooded by constant rain and meltwater. It wasn’t long before the entire unpopulated valley was flooded, and created a lake with a volume of more than 16 cubic kilometers. But this lake is a constant source of worries to the Tajik government, since, given its location in one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the world, it seems highly likely that a future earthquake could destroy the dam and release a catastrophic flash flood. If this flood occurred, the entire content of the lake would be pressed through the narrow valleys of Tajikistan, destroying everything in its way, endangering more than five million people. It could also affect the neighboring countries Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Another constant threat is that filtration water apparently created a number of cavities inside the dam, which might destabilize the entire dam wall. But the largest threat is a partially detached rock mass of three cubic kilometers at the edge of the lake, which, if it fell into the lake, it could put too much additional pressure on the dam, and might result in its collapse. In 2004, a monitoring system has been put in place on Sarez Lake and valleys, that would be affected by the destruction of Sarez Lake, received an early-warning system.",
1,Wall of Great Tajik Writers,"Dushanbe, Tajikistan",A building facade covered with the statues of 11 giants of Tajik literature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wall-of-great-tajik-writers,"If you thought that all there was to Tajik literature was the famous Persian poet Rudaki, perhaps you might want to visit the Wall of Great Tajik Writers. The “Wall” is the facade of the Writers’ Union building in Dushanbe, home to an association of novelists, poets, playwrights, and other writers. The large wall is carved with nine niches containing eleven life-size statues of famous Tajik writers, a tribute to Tajikistan’s Persian and Soviet history. The 8th-century “Adam of Poets,” Rudaki, justifiably takes the centre stage. He is considered a father of classical Persian literature, though sadly only a small portion of his work has survived the test of time. Other notable writers on the wall include poet Ferdowsi (940-1020); poet, mathematician and astronomer Omar Khayyam (1048-1131); writer and intellectual Sadriddin Ayni (1878-1954); and poet Mirzo Tursunzoda (1911-1977). In the garden next to the building is a large statue of Ayni and famous Soviet writer Maxim Gorky sitting around a table, absorbed in conversation. The Writers’ Union building was designed by renowned architect E. Salikhov and constructed in the early 1980s. The structure immediately became an exemplary manifestation of Soviet Modernist architecture, a trend that incorporated local sensibilities within the Soviet architectural tradition, which emphasized social purposefulness, grandiosity (regarding size), and frugality (regarding construction materials). All these features are clearly seen in Salikhov’s creation in Dushanbe. The Writers’ Union dates back to the Soviet era, when all literary organizations were absorbed into a union supervised by the government. The objective was to ensure that contemporary and older literary work for public consumption would not contravene Communist ideals. Nowadays, the organization’s goals resemble those of writers’ unions in most any other country.","The Writers’ Union Building is located in the center of the city, next to the National Museum of Tajikistan, Rudaki Park (another tribute to the famous poet), the Dushanbe Flag Pole, and many other attractions in the capital."
2,Yamchun Fort,"Ishkoshim, Tajikistan",This ancient Silk Road outpost overlooking the Wakhan Valley is miraculously still standing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yamchun-fort,"Located between the modern-day border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, at elevations ranging from 9,964 feet (3,037 meters) in Ishkashim to 16,152 feet (4,923 meters) at the Wakhjir Pass, the remote and barren Wakhan Valley was once a thriving corridor along the Silk Road. Ruins of caravanserais, stupas, forts, towers, and palaces littering the whole valley testify to a glorious past. Traders from near and far have been plying the Silk Road for millennia. This flurry of activities did not escape the keen eye of the Kushan Empire, which realized that traders needed safe passage to transport their goods, which they could guarantee in exchange for levies. A large number of fortresses were built with the dual purpose of protecting traders from raiders and protecting the empire from neighboring peoples. Yamchun Fortress is the best preserved of all these constructions. The fortress is not in great shape, but given that it sits on top of a highly eroded hill in an area prone to earthquakes and landslides, it is a marvel that it is still standing. Originally built in 300 BC (or 100 BC according to some sources), Yamchun overlooks large swathes of the Wakhan Valley, and large sections of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northernmost Afghan territories. How much of the original fortress is visible today is debatable, as the ancient structure was expanded between the 10th and 12th centuries. The triangular shape of the fortress follows approximately the shape of the hilltop.  Two layers of fortified walls delineate its perimeter. Round towers with narrow openings look down toward the valley. Looking at the towers still standing, it is clear that they were built in stages, judging from the different coloring of the stones and bonding material. It is suspected that within the Yamchum Fortress there was a Zoroastrian temple of eternal fire. Considering it was the predominant religion of the time, this would be hardly surprising, but there is no unanimous consensus as to whether there actually was a temple in the fortress.","Public transport to Yamchum village is patchy to say the least. Only a handful of shared taxis come this far, but it is common to flag down any passing vehicle and contribute to the cost of the ride.  From Yamchun village to the fortress is another 8 km of gentle uphill switchbacks or 4 km of steep climbing along trails. Having your own vehicle is by far the best option."
3,Hulbuk Fortress,"Pingan, Tajikistan",This medieval citadel once guarded the western entrance of the Pamir Highway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hulbuk-fortress,"From the ninth to 12th centuries, Hulbuk was one of the biggest cities in Central Asia. There, a citadel guarded the western entrance of the Pamir Highway and the nearby salt mines of Khoja Mumin. Two palaces were built inside the citadel; the lower palace in the ninth and 10th centuries and the upper in the 11th and 12th centuries. But when the kingdom collapsed, so did the citadel. It became overrun by Mongols and Turkish tribes. In the centuries afterward, a new market town, Kulob, was founded nearby. In the 1950s, Soviet archaeologists excavated the site. Several artifacts can be seen in the museum of antiquities in Dushanbe, as well as in the museum at the other site of the road. Wallpaintings of animal-gods, swastikas, and dancers show that Hulbuk was more Zoroastrian than Islamic. Recently, the citadel walls were completely rebuilt in the Muslim style, with shiny bricks and inlaid Koran verses at the majestic entrance gate.","The fortress cannot be missed when traversing between Kulob/Vose and Danghara. There's a lovely museum on the other side of the road. Formally, the fortress is closed to visitors, as excavations are ongoing. But if you're kind, the site warden may answer your questions and tell you about his own excavation work."
4,Shorbulak Observatory,Tajikistan,"This remote, abandoned Soviet observatory promises spectacular views for those who can reach it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shorbulak-observatory,"An abandoned Soviet observatory on the top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere in Tajikistan sounds inviting, no? Shorbulak Observatory, once the site of challenging astronomical observations, stands as a remnant of the former Soviet Union. Located some 4,350 meters (14,200 feet) above sea level, this remote site in the Pamir mountains was perfect for an observatory. The dry climate made it an ideal spot to study submillimeter-wavelength astronomy. Observing these incredibly short wavelengths can be especially challenging because water in the atmosphere can interfere with measurements. Land-based observatories that can study this type of astronomy must be located at dry, cool sites with stable weather conditions located far from dense population. Other sites include Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory in Chile, the South Pole, and Hanle in India. Shorbulak was an outpost of the Pulkovo Observatory—officially known as the Central Astronomical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences at Pulkovo. It was one of several offshoots of Pulkovo Observatory, with others located in Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Caucasus Mountains, Chile, and Bolivia. In the 1980s, the observatory was run by Russian astrophysicist Kirill Maslennikov. Though it is no longer active, Shorbulak Observatory still stands in its location in the Pamirs. But reaching it is no easy feat. First you must get to the Pamir Highway, the second highest altitude  highway in the world. Heading south of the city of  Murgab, you must get off the beaten path for a good piece of land and sandy roads. It takes a while, but as soon as you get there you are rewarded with the site of an abandoned Soviet village, old trucks, warehouses, and the empty observatory right over the hill.","It is possible to visit the village and see the outside of the observatory, but the building itself is private property. Please be respectful of the laws and posted signs. Be aware that a 4x4 vehicle is advisable, since is an off-road environment."
5,Tomb of Rudaki,"Panjakent, Tajikistan",Where the father of Persian poetry is laid to rest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-rudaki,"Nestled in the Fan mountains in the northwest of Tajikistan is the resting place of the man known as the father of Persian poetry. Born around 859, Rudaki is one of the primary historical figures of post-Soviet Tajikistan, strongly figuring into the national identity as a symbol of not just artistic achievement but also as a cultural touchstone for modern Tajiks. Rudaki, born as Abu ‘Abdollah Ja’far ibn Mohammed, enjoys a certain status as a more glamorous historical figure, one who was semi-royalty, serving as a court poet in Bukhara to the Samanid ruler Nasr II until he lost favor in 937 and returned to his hometown of Panjrud, where he lived the rest of his life in poverty until his death around 941. Also known as an accomplished singer and musician, Rudaki has even been portrayed in Satim Ulughzoda’s 1959 film Qismat-i Sho’ir (in English, “A Poet’s Fate”) as a kind of literary action hero/heartthrob in the dramatized biopic. In Tajikistan’s capital of Dushanbe, about five hours driving distance from Rudaki’s hometown and resting place of Panjrud, everything from the main avenue to a large public park near the parliament building, complete with a giant statue of the poet, are graced by his name. Despite his fame and prominence in Tajik culture in particular, there is a stillness, a sanctity imparted by the mausoleum’s remote location, about 40 miles outside the city of Panjakent. The gravel road leading to Rudaki’s resting place is rocky and uneven, and though the mausoleum was built in 1958, the villagers of Panjrud still look up with surprise at the sight of foreigners and tourists. The keeper of the mausoleum unlocks the carved wooden gates that enclose an expansive, well-manicured, brilliantly green garden filled with roses. Written over the gate—in both the Perso-Arabic script that Rudaki wrote in in the 10th century, and the Cyrillic script in which Tajiki is written in now—is one of the poet’s most famous verses, which states, “There is no greater joy in this world/ Than seeing the faces of friends.” Inside, the surrounding walls and marble floors are a pristine, glowing, almost heavenly white, diffused in natural light that shines from holes in the ceiling onto the dark wooden coffin, topped with marble, resting in the center of the mausoleum. Downhill from Rudaki’s actual resting place is a small museum which displays artifacts from Rudaki’s life and the history of the Sughd region, along with a library of numerous translations and editions of the work of Rudaki and other Persian poets. Academics estimate that Rudaki produced upwards of 100,000 poems, or bayts, although only 1,000 have survived and are in existence today, many of them in fragments and found from varying sources. Still, Rudaki is credited with establishing Persian as a poetic language and influencing the style and form of generations of Persian poets after him.",You can drive from Panjakent via taxi or mashrutka. Nowadays there's a decent asphalt road from the main highway (between Penjikent and Dushanbe) all the way to the parking of the tomb.
6,Ancient Panjakent,"Nohijai Pançakent, Tajikistan",The remains of an ancient city-state along the Silk Road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-panjakent,"Ancient Panjakent was one of the easternmost settlements of the Sogdiana Empire, an Iranian civilization that ruled large swathes of territories in central Asia more than a thousand years ago. Zoroastrianism was the predominant religion of the empire, and its holy books mention Sogdiana as the second-best land that god created. Sogdiana history goes back to the Bronze Age and further, and includes such historic celebrities as Cyrus the Great, Darius I, Xerxes, and Alexander the Great. But the empire began flourishing around the beginning of the 400s CE, thanks to extensive trade along the Silk Road. Countless Sogdian settlements of all sizes could be found along the famous ancient trade route, and the bigger ones acted as de facto city-states. Panjakent was one of them, and its importance was underpinned by the fact that anyone traveling between Samarkand and Kuhiston Mountains had to pass through this city. Archaeologists found evidence that Panjakent was founded around the year 400 and was abandoned by the end of 800. Year 722 marked the arrival of Arab conquerors, which prompted the abandonment of the city and the introduction of the Islamic religion in the region. Unlike most other ancient settlements in central Asia, Ancient Panjakent was abandoned in haste and never built over by subsequent dwellers. Excavations of the ancient city began in 1946 and are still ongoing. To date, archaeologists have unearthed residential and suburban quarters that include two Zoroastrian temples, modest dwellings, and workshops; the citadel, which includes a large palace and fortified walls; and the necropolis, with evidence of ossuaries and fire-altars typical of Zoroastrian civilizations. Separating these buildings is a network of streets and lanes that were often covered by vaults. The predominant construction method was mud and clay bricks, which is still used nowadays for pens and stables. One of the most remarkable findings in Ancient Panjakent were the frescoes, some of which were remarkably well preserved and show revealing aspects of life and religious beliefs from the era. Some of these frescoes are now housed at Rudaki Museum, located in the centre of Panjakent, while others are in the National Museum in Dushanbe and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.","The above map coordinates will take you to the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Penjikent excavations. Ancient Panjakent is perched on top of a hill overlooking modern-day Panjakent, and it is not fenced off, which means that there are several entry points. There is, however, an official entrance that taxi drivers usually take visitors to. For a small fee, visitors gain access to the ancient city and the museum across the street. The term “museum” may be an overstatement since it consists of a room with some artifacts excavated in the area and some information about Russian archaeologist B. Marshak, who led the excavations for decades."
7,Anzob Tunnel,"Ayni, Tajikistan","This dark, damp, perilous tunnel is the only passage from north to south Tajikistan.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anzob-tunnel,"The purpose of a tunnel is to get you from one place to another, preferably alive. The Anzob Tunnel is making no promises in that regard. 5,040 meters of tunneled asphalt make up the connection between north and south Tajikistan, arguably a step up from the former dirt road that was regularly closed due to frequent, almost year-round avalanches.  Called “The Tunnel of Fear” and “The Tunnel of Death” by locals, its importance lies in the fact that, unlike the previous route, it avoids cutting through less-than-friendly Uzbekistan. The construction of this route between major cities Dushanbe and Khujand has allowed commerce to flow with far less interruption, and Tajikistan no longer has to be split in two through the entire winter season. Sounds fantastic, so what’s the problem? It can’t be that dangerous, at least not as dangerous as an unfriendly territory or a snowed-in dirt road, right? Let’s start with illumination in the tunnel–there isn’t any. Aside from the headlights of your vehicle and those of your fellow tunnel dwellers, there is no lighting to speak of. Not completely unheard of; an inconvenience really–until you realize there are potholes. Not small potholes that give you a little rattle as you truck along, but BIG potholes. Big, axle-snapping potholes that are difficult to see in the dark tunnel, that also happen to be filled with water. Some of them have several feet of water, and are basically small, tunnel ponds. The tunnel does, theoretically, possess two lanes in the form of two more-or-less separate tunnels through the mountain; however, one of the two tunnels is perpetually closed for repairs, meaning the tunnel is de facto a permanent one-way street. The reality of the tunnel’s width, however, is ignored as Chinese 18-wheelers, SUVs and sturdy Soviet Ladas navigate a gut-wrenching obstacle course that includes not only oncoming traffic but also broken-down construction equipment and feet-deep ponds. Things could be worse, though: you could always break down. There’s a few reasons why breaking down in this tunnel would be less than ideal, especially since the odds are so stacked against getting to the other side unscathed. Besides being trapped in a dark, wet tunnel where other cars are careening around you in chaos, the most terrifying reason to want to keep moving is the lack of ventilation. With one, pathetic fan attempting to push air around, the tunnel is filled with exhaust so thick that visibility is only a few feet. While carbon monoxide poisoning is certain, the amount of time you spend trapped would determine whether that exposure becomes fatal or not. Travelers have reported feeling dizzy, nauseous and ill while passing through the tunnel; reportedly, workers on the tunnel, who are drawn from surrounding villages and rarely possess adequate air filtration systems, have died due to overexposure to the poisonous emissions. But that’s it – if you can survive the traffic, the potholes and the fumes, then you’re home free! Except for the rocks. There is always the occasional falling rock to keep an eye out for. That’s it though. Other than giant, water-filled potholes, no lights, every-man-for-himself navigation, toxic gasses and the sporadic avalanche, the Anzob Tunnel is totally safe. The tunnel was repaired in the spring and summer of 2015 and is reportedly in much better condition than previously; however, the one-lane-only issue remains. In 2018, the tunnel was just a regular tunnel in Central Asia; for the most part it is lit now, the surface is decent asphalt and there is plenty of room in the “one-lane” for trucks and cars in both directions.",
8,Tajikistan Lenin Statue,"Khujand, Tajikistan",The largest Lenin statue in Central Asia was moved to an empty field rather than being destroyed.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tajikistan-lenin-statue,"Dismantled and relegated to a field on the outskirts of town, a massive likeness of the Father of the Bolshevik Revolution can’t get any respect in modern society. After decades spent lording over the city, Central Asia’s largest statue of Vladimir Lenin was finally removed from its plinth in downtown Khujand, Tajikistan in May of 2011. Erected in 1974 on the 50th anniversary of Lenin’s death, when Khujand was then called Leninabad, official measurements put the statue at 12 meters in height, plus an additional 12 meters for the base. All together, this made the monument Central Asia’s largest statue of the former leader of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party. But by the dawn of the new millennium, Tajik officials felt the statue’s time had come and gone. So it was with little ceremony and under the cover of darkness that a gigantic likeness of the former leader of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party was dismantled, whereupon his pieces were transported to an out-of-the-way park west of the city called Victory Field. Here Lenin was reassembled atop his perch, where he oversees a field. All this is to say that Tajikistan has effectively relegated Lenin to the safest, deadest quadrant of its history. Back in the bustling sectors of its living, day-to-day world, Lenin’s former footsteps will eventually be occupied by a statue of the founder of Tajik statehood, Ismoili Somoni, where it will likely hold the title of Largest Somoni Statue on Earth.",Ask for directions after crossing the river. Watch out for cows.
9,Hisor Fort,"Hisor, Tajikistan","The first version of this stalwart construction appeared around 3,000 years ago.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hisor-fort,"Hisor Fort is conveniently located along the Khanaka River, in Hisor Valley. The building has gone through different reconstructions, renovations, and additions. Historical records point at a fort in Hisor as far back as 1000 BC. More recent records of the fort relate to the time when Cyrus the Great founded the first Persian Empire (around 550 BC). Not much of the original fort has passed the test of time, unfortunately. Dating the current fort is not a straightforward task, as different buildings were added at different times. Inside the fortress, recently, a wedding ceremony building was erected. The oldest surviving part of Hisor Fort is the arched gate, which is probably from around the year 500. Chasmai Mohiyon Mosque was built in 700, the same period of time when the construction of Sangin Mosque (Stone Mosque) also started, but this wasn’t completed until almost 1,000 years later. A salient feature of Sangin Mosque is the four bottomless jugs placed within the walls of the dome to improve the acoustics of the hall. The 1500s mark the building of several components of the fort, namely the wall where the main gate is located, the Old Madrassa, the Makhdumi A’zam Mausoleum, and some additions to the Old Mosque. One of the latest additions next to the fort is a caravanserai from 1808, a place for Silk Road traders and their camels to safely spend the night. Only the lower part of the caravanserai remains, as the top layer was taken by the Soviets to build a theater in Dushanbe. Most of the structures have been renovated. The Old Madrassa houses a museum with items from Tajikistan’s rural past and Soviet memorabilia. Also, old horse stables can be found on the other side of the road.","Hisor is about 16 miles west of Dushanbe. There is plenty of public transport to reach the place, but it is not easy to locate the correct bus stop in Dushanbe. The easiest and fastest to get to Hisor is by taxi, which can be cheap, depending on your bargaining skills. Visiting Hisor Fort on Sunday pretty much guarantees the opportunity to run into a wedding or three."
10,Dushanbe Flagpole,"Dushanbe, Tajikistan",The world's second-tallest flagpole stands proud despite dropping rank.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dushanbe-flagpole,"How high does the Flag of Tajikistan fly? According to the Guinness Book of World Records, higher than any other at a dizzying 541 ft. The Dushanbe Flagpole was constructed by a San Diego-based construction company named Trident Support, who also erected the record breaker’s runner up, the 531 ft. National Flagpole in Azerbaijan. Consisting of 12-meter sections of steel tubing which were assembled by crane, the massive endeavor took five months to complete, the first test flight of the national flag taking place in May, 2011. Such was the state of things until 2014, when its position was usurped by Saudi Arabia’s Jedda Flagpole, which measured in at 170 meters in height. All three flagpoles occupying the top spots on what would be the world’s most precarious podium, in addition to also-rans in Jordan and Abu Dhabi, were marketed, sold and built by Trident Support Corporation, based in San Diego, California. Originally a defense logistics company, Trident has managed to corner the market on this obscure niche of what’s been called the “global dictator dick-measuring contest” since the turn of the new millennium. Tajikistan’s erstwhile most-gigantic-flagpole-ever can be found standing tall in front of Palace of Nations in Dushanbe. In total, the project cost the fledgling nation $3.5 million, part of an exorbitant $210 million spent on construction celebrating the 20th anniversary of Tajikistan’s independence. The Flag of Tajikistan that graces the mighty pole had to be epic in its own right to be seen from such a great distance, weighing in at 1,543 pounds, and measuring approximately 98 × 196 feet. Regardless of whether it occupies the silver medal position for long, when viewed from the ground, those 15 feet that currently separate it from dominating its competitors are hardly noticeable, making for an awesome spectacle made all the more disorienting when placed against the backdrop of Dushanbe’s modest cityscape.",
11,Red Lotus Lake,"Tambon Chiang Haeo, Thailand",Stunning wetlands ablaze with pink lotus flowers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lotus-lake,"A true surprise in northeast Thailand—often considered to be solely a rice-farming region—these wetlands remain predominantly hidden by tall elephant grasses that belie the expanses of water lying beyond them, and are known for the most part only by the local villagers who venture out to fish and to collect snails and lotus stalks for use in the preparation of their daily meals. Best visited in the cool season from December through February, these shallow, limpid waters may only be visited on a wooden boat belonging to the local fishermen and villagers. Having cleared the elephant grasses, a thick carpet of pink lotus blooms suddenly confronts you. A constellation of millions of startling, flamingo-pink lotus flowers dance above the crystalline waters of the Lotus Sea. This is quite literally the land of the lotus-eaters! The seeds and stems may both be eaten, and the flowers are an important Buddhist symbol. If the lotus plant does not seduce you from a culinary standpoint, then do try the fiery local cuisine with its spicy salads, lime-bathed fish, and fresh meat dishes: the food of the Northeast has now become a favorite among the Thais and may be found throughout the kingdom. The wetlands are home to around 80 species of bird, including the endangered grey heron, purple heron, and black kite. Other rare species include the Brahminy kite and the cotton pygmy-goose.","Due to the picturesque sea of pink and red lotus flowers which cover lake Nong Han, this place becomes insanely busy during Valentine's Day weekend by couples all waiting to capture that perfect shot. There is also a Red Lotus Sea Festival which is held mid-January at the nearby Wat Bandiem. From Udon Thani Airport, the lake is around 50km (31 miles) away and is easily reached in about one hour by hiring a local driver, motorcycle, or a car.  Booking a place to stay within minutes of the lake's boat departure point is the most convenient option, at properties such as Gecko Villa or Green Gecko."
12,Wat Rong Khun,"Chiang Rai, Thailand",A white Buddhist temple with a golden restroom.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-rong-khun,"In a nation of temples, Thailand’s Wat Rong Khun stands out. Known as the White Temple, Wat Rong Khun is located in Northern Thailand in Chiang Rai. The project of well-known Thai artist Chalermchai Kosipipat, and the temple was funded by Kosipipat’s selling of his paintings. Construction began in 1997 and was completed in 2008, although new elements are still being added. Kosipipat wanted to create an elegant temple to honor Buddha’s purity, but the temple is distinct in both its style and symbolism. Much of the temple is dedicated to depicting samsara, the Buddhist cycle of birth and death due to delusion and fixation on the self.  Thus, the temple and its grounds are surprisingly contemporary, focusing on fictional elements of our materialistic world: the predator struggling to free itself from the ground, aliens, and elaborate murals depicting Neo from The Matrix, Superman, and an angry bird flying towards the World Trade Center Towers. Photography of the murals is prohibited, but visitors can purchase reproductions at the gift shop. Unlike most Thai temples, the building is all white, with glass and mirrors embedded into the outside to make it shine and sparkle in the sunlight. However, Kosipipat ultimately designed the White Temple to be viewed in moonlight when it appears particularly ghostly and otherworldly. An ornately decorated gold building to the left of the temple houses a public restroom, which is often humorously referred to as the most beautiful restroom in Thailand. The White Temple was severely damaged in a 2014 earthquake, but it has been fully restored.","The temple closes between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m., when no visitors are allowed inside."

The Wat Samphran Temple is rarely featured in guidebooks and is considerably removed from the typical tourist track. Travelers who’ve happened upon the temple in their journeys have described an interior in mild disrepair but filled with stunning statues and shrines, including a giant bronze Buddha. The dragon itself is reportedly hollow, and visitors are able to walk some sections of it, though other parts of the temple remain closed to the public.",
14,Phraya Nakhon Cave,"Sam Roi Yot, Thailand","At the right time of day, sunlight floods through the roof of this cave and illuminates the small pavilion hidden within.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phraya-nakhon-cave,"Seen at the perfect moment, few sights in Thailand are more spectacular than the Phraya Nakhon Cave. As the rays of the morning sun flood through the roof of the cavern, a small pavilion on the floor of the cave is bathed in a majestic golden glow. It’s the kind of place Indiana Jones would find a fabled life-renewing relic, or where a young apprentice would finally meet a reclusive Jedi Master. The Phraya Nakhon Cave is located inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park in the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province of Thailand. According to local legend, the cave was discovered around 200 years ago when a local ruler, Nakhon Srithammaraja, was forced to abandon his ship during a storm and found refuge in the cave. Some historians, however, believe the cave was discovered by, or at least named after, a nobleman called Nakhon, who lived in the region in the 17th century. Either way, the cave has long been a treasured natural attraction along the northern part of the Malay Peninsula. When sunlight floods into the cavern, it illuminates the cave’s stalagmites and stalactites, and the lush green trees that lean toward the light from the sandy floor below. It’s a serene and mystical sight, and one deemed fit for kings. In 1890, for the visit of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), a mound was built inside the cave. Upon this mound was placed a small pavilion, built in Bangkok and assembled inside the cave. Positioned perfectly to catch the full flood of the morning sunlight, the Khuha Kharuehat Pavilion, as it is known, has since become an iconic symbol of the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. It was later visited by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII), who, like King Chulalongkorn, inscribed his name on the wall of the cavern’s main chamber. The late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) also visited the Phraya Nakhon Cave, but unlike his predecessors he did not leave his signature on the wall.","Phraya Nakhon Cave is located inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park in the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province of Thailand. It’s about 110 miles south-southwest from Bangkok (as the crow flies), and about a 45-minute drive south of Hua Hin. From the small village of Bang Pu, you can either take a boat around the cape to the cave, or hike for 30 to 45 minutes. Either way, you’ll still have a final 1,410-feet hike up steep steps through the forest to the cave entrance. It’s tough going, so take water. The entrance fee to Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park is 200 Thai Baht per person, with no additional fee for the cave. Guides are available but unnecessary, and many of them are children.

Founded in 1975, the park is named for the mythical three-headed white elephant which the uppermost of the falls is said to resemble. In addition to the waterfalls the park is also home to a series of caves known as Mi, Rua, Wang Bahdan, and Phartat. Visitors can hike along the seven waterfalls and swim in their pools.","The 3rd-7th waterfalls close by 15:30, while the 1st and 2nd tiers close around 16:30-17:00, depending on how the rangers feel.If you are pressed for time, hike to the top first, and swim in the waterfalls on the way down because after 3:30, the top most levels will be closed off."
16,The Wang Saen Suk Hell Garden,"Tambon Saen Suk, Thailand",Walk through depictions of the torture inflicted on those who go to Buddhist hell.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-wang-saen-suk-hell-garden-tambon-saen-suk-thailand,"Wang Saen Suk is a garden full of statues depicting what is supposed to be Buddhist hell. While the garden attracts plenty of families, there are gruesome scenes depicted there. After passing a “Welcome to Hell!” sign, visitors encounter sinners boiled in copper cauldrons, sinners being torn apart by hell’s dogs, and emaciated sinners with protruding ribs. “If you meet the Devil in this life, don’t postpone merit-making which will help you to defeat him in the next life,” a sign in the garden reads. “Donate a little each day and you’ll have a happy life.” According to the “Traibhumi Phra Ruang,” when a Buddhist dies, he or she goes before four celestial beings who check the dead’s record of good and bad deeds. If your good deeds outweigh the bad, you will go to heaven; if your bad deeds outweigh the good, you will be punished. Punishment in Buddhist hell varies depending on the sins committed, but every form of punishment is a torture, and many of those are depicted in the garden. Hell has 136 pits, but individuals are able to be reborn from each. Loganta, a special pit reserved for those who have hurt their parents or monks physically, is the only cold pit and those sent there are said to remain until a new Buddha is born.","The temple is a little difficult to find at first glance. Go all the way down the road until you see an archway. Go through it and you'll see a giant Buddha. Once you get there, be sure to put some donation into the Buddha belly. This temple will not charge you so make sure to leave something generous so they can keep maintaining this amazing location.This is located in Chonburi and takes some time and work to get to from Bangkok for tourists not familiar with the area. If you have a lot of time in Bangkok or can see it as a side trip on the way to Pattaya, then it is pretty interesting to see. Otherwise, plan on it taking up the majority of your day if you're traveling from Bangkok."
17,Amulet Market,"Bangkok, Thailand",Bangkok's men with dangerous jobs come here in search of protective talismans.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amulet-market,"Who’s to say what form divine protection may take? Known as the Amulet Market, the corridors are lined with stalls whose only wares are thousand upon thousands of sacred trinkets bestowed with protections. The exact protections of each amulet vary, offering to ward off evil of all manner both spiritual and physical in nature. Filled of locals and visitors alike, everyone is here to pick through the vendors’ wares for the special medallion or figurine that will do the trick for them: protecting the harvest, bringing good health, blessing a new home. When it comes to the amulets themselves, there aren’t a lot of hard and fast rules. Few of the articles for sale are larger than, say, a baseball, while most fit easily in the palm of one’s hand. Many are purported to contain particles from sacred temples far away, such as spent incense, blessings from monks, etc. The amulets can take the form of Buddhas bearing a range of expressions, to shards of bone, medallions, chunks of wood from sacred spaces varying expressions, brass phalluses, or even real human parts – like hair. All these elements combine to create tokens of good luck that have been protecting generations of working Thai men from all sorts of terrible fates. At the Amulet market, there are no shamans around to help in the divination process. It’s up to each individual doing the digging to identify which treasure speaks to their need. This makes a simple people-watching excursion to the Amulet Market one of the more gratifying and mystical experiences around, even if you yourself aren’t looking to take home a small something with magical potential. Amulets can cost as little as 5 baht (the same price as a trip to some public toilets) and up to hundreds of baht. Prices are rarely displayed, implying some haggling or bargaining is necessary. While you’re in the area, don’t forget about the nearby side alleys (heading towards the water). Some heavy rings and more amulets may catch your eyes, and there are enough cheap food stalls to feed the staff that work in the immediate area.","Serviced by ferries from Chang Pier, Maharaj Pier, and Phra Chan Tai Pier. From National Stadium BTS, take exit 2 down to street level, make a U-turn, and walk 20 meters to the bus stop. Get on bus 47 and ride for 20-30 minutes. Get off when you’re in front of the Grand Palace or Sanam Luang (the big park just past it). There’s a side street heading left between the two; head down that for about 400 meters and turn right.

Or, in the case of Bangkok restaurant Wattana Panich, the next generation. The giant pot of neua tune, a beef stew popular in the Thai capital, has been simmering since owner Nattapong Kaweenuntawong was a child, more than 45 years ago. Growing up studying the exact flavor profile of the stew from his father, Kaweenuntawong now balances the flavor himself daily. He employs an ancient practice called Hunter’s Stew or Perpetual Stew, using some of the previous day’s leftover broth to start the base of the following day’s soup. “We keep tasting. There is no recipe,” he told Channel News Asia. A secret blend of spices and herbs, stewed beef, raw beef slices, meatballs, tripe, and other organs swim about the deeply bubbling vat. While new restaurants and high-end condominiums now dwarf the humble one-story bistro in Bangkok’s busy Ekamai neighborhood, the complex and rich flavor of Wattana Panich’s headline soup keeps the dish relevant and its followers loyal.",

Although this tower karst was a relatively unknown indigenous site before the early ’70s, that all changed when the British Secret Service’s number one agent came to town. In 1974, the James Bond film The Man With the Golden Gun was released. One of the film’s scenes featured Bond’s nemesis, Francisco Scaramanga, hiding out at Phang Nga Bay and using the solar panels on the island to power his laser gun. The movie, which referred to the island as a “mushroom-shaped rock,” catapulted Phang Nga Bay’s tourism industry, so much so that the island was dedicated to 007 himself with the name of James Bond Island. But James Bond is not the only namesake of the tall little islet, which is located just offshore from Khao Phing Kan island, part of Ao Phang Nga National Park. According to local mythology, the island was created when one day a Thai fisherman failed to catch a single fish and came up only with a nail. In frustration, he’d throw the nail into the ocean, but magically, the nail would return to his hand. In anger, the fisherman cut the nail in half with a knife, letting the half-nail fall into the bay. To the fisherman’s astonishment, the half-nail erupted to form the giant nail-shaped limestone tower that stands today, giving it its original Thai name, Ko Ta Pu, or Nail Island.",

It is housed in Siriraj Hospital, Thailand’s oldest hospital and medical school, which was established in 1886 and is where the King of Thailand goes when he is ill. The Siriraj is actually comprised of six different museums: a museum of pathology, a forensics museum, a museum of the history of Thai medicine, a parasitology museum, an anatomical museum, and a prehistoric museum. The Ellis Pathological Museum is the oldest of the six museums, founded by the American pathologist Dr. Aller G. Ellis. He collected organs from patients who had been diagnosed with common disorders such as heart disease and cancer,  to serve as teaching tools for medical students. The Siriraj’s incredible holdings include bones, preserved organs, pathological fetuses, the mummified corpse of a notorious serial killer, a traditional Thai medicine shop, parasitic worms, a two-and-a-half-foot-wide scrotum removed from a man afflicted with elephantiasis, preserved sections of human skin bearing tattoos, poisonous snakes and tarantulas, rows of skulls, the standing wax-filled remains of a cannibal, a delicately dissected nervous system, and the skeleton of the museum’s founder.

22,Bangkok's Ghost Tower: The Sathorn Unique,"Bangkok, Thailand",On stormy days debris from this unfinished and abandoned skyscraper rains down on the Bangkok streets.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bangkoks-ghost-tower-the-sathorn-unqiue,"The Sathorn Unique skyscraper is among the major construction projects started when Thailand’s economy was booming in the 1990s. Developers envisaged a city of gleaming offices and residential skyscrapers that were to be a testament to the nation’s rapid development. Then Thailand sank into a swamp of reckless investments and unpaid debts that became known as the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The country’s economy contracted 10% in 1998 and many of the building projects came to a crashing halt, including this 49-story tower. Many towers have finally come to completion and construction is continuing, however many broke developers are still unable or unwilling to take action. The Sathorn Unique has an eerie feel, with exposed infrastructure giving it a post-apocalyptic look. According to one blogger, abandoned rooms were filled with curious objects, from mannequins to a picture of the King. Locals say that the building is haunted. Have a look at the building’s commercial brochure: “Sathorn Unique Tower is our first residential project in downtown Bangkok. The tower is 49 stories with the total of 659 residential units and 54 retails, located only less than 200 meters from BTS: Taksin station. Sathorn Unique Tower is also located at the edge of old commercial town of Charernkrung meets the new international business zone of Silom-Sathorn roads. It sits on the horse-shoe bend which is considered the best place for overlook at the Bangkok’s grand cityscape and the charm of the Chaopraya River.” Getting to the top terrace of the building is possible, but it is absolutely not a good idea, and the structure is fragile and bares many holes in the floors. Instead, check out the tower’s 10-storey high car park, just opposite to the building (North side of the tower). Adapted with permission from Exploguide.com dedicated to travelers looking for alternative and off the beaten track travel.","This place is off limits. As of June 2016, a fence made of corrugated tin now surrounds the tower, and there's plenty of signs indicating that trespassers will be prosecuted. It's not impossible to get in, but it's certainly illegal. There are people working or living within the corrugated walls of the Sathorn depsite its rundown state. It is infinitely disconcerting to see the shadows shifting on the high ceilings and a face peering out at you from between the metal sheets. So trek wisely."
23,Maeklong Railway Market,"Mae Klong, Thailand","Six times a day a train runs right through the middle of this Thai street market, sending vendors scrambling.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-maeklong-railway-market-mae-klong-thailand,"Six times a day, a train rolls right through the centre of the Maeklong Railway Market. Six times a day, vendors and buyers have three minutes to get out of the way. A very loud whistle gives the warning call, and everyone scrambles to move produce off the tracks, roll back awnings, and take down umbrellas before the train arrives. In fact, the market is sometimes called the “umbrella pull down market” for this very reason. But vendors have to do a lot more than that. They have to pick up baskets of fish, beans, and bananas and move them off the tracks. In some cases, they just leave them as they know the train will clear them. As the train comes through the very narrow market lane, there is only inches to spare on each side. Maeklong Railway Market is also called the world’s most dangerous market. Unfortunately, people have occasionally lost their lives, though the train moves very slowly through the market. The bizarre phenomenon leads many people to visit the market for the novelty of seeing the train run right through it, rather than for the goods sold. The market sells mostly fresh foods, Thai sweets, flowers, herbs, spices, drinks, fish, and seafood. In fact, it’s one of the biggest seafood markets in Thailand. But the food aside, seeing the sprawling market spring to life when the train rolls through makes for a worthwhile stop when you’re in the area. Just remember: when you hear the whistle, step back, and maybe get your camera ready.","The market is located in Samut Songkhram city, Muang Samut Songkhram District, which runs along the Gulf of Thailand’s coastline southwest of Bangkok. It’s only about 60km from Bangkok. You can get there by train, public van (minibus), or car. A fun thing to do is ride the Maeklong Railway through the market, and then get off and explore."
24,Wat Pha Sorn Kaew (Temple on the Glass Cliff),"Tambon Khaem Son, Thailand",Modern design and unusual architecture make this mountaintop temple no ordinary Buddhist retreat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phar-sorn-kaew-temple-on-the-glass-cliff,"Hidden away high up in the hills of north central Thailand, Wat Pha Sorn Kaew is a Dharma retreat for monks and Buddhist followers. The mountaintop sanctuary, with a preaching hall, pagoda, and surrounding gardens, is a stunning design, one that expresses its architectural youthfulness. The site’s location at Khao Kho was chosen for its natural beauty, to inspire meditation. Set against the serenity of the mountains is the site’s most striking feature, the ice-white temple itself, representing the traditional five Buddhas who visited the Earth. The Buddhas are nested together in the meditation position, looking out over the valley. Each one is slightly larger than the one before, a modern and refreshing design with few hints of traditional Thai architecture. The non-traditional design extends to the pagoda, a lotus flower-inspired shape set over five levels, with a large glass structure hanging down through the centre to connect each floor. The surfaces are covered with over 5 million mosaic tiles, pottery shards, and pieces of teapots and China sets, with no two patterns alike. It’s colorful and quirky, and sitting in the middle of the mosaics is said to bring fortune and good luck. Wat Pha Sorn Kaew (also known as Wat Pra Tat Pha Kaew and Watpratarpharsornkaew) was mostly completed in 2004, and was elevated to the status of temple only in 2010. In its short history, despite its remote location, it has become a center for the foundation of mindfulness practice, one of the core Buddhist principles. It could be argued that Wat Pha Sorn Kaew feels out of place in the remote hills of northern Thailand, and it does bear a striking resemblance to the style of Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí. Its style is unlike any other, but no matter the design, the views are breathtaking and the landscape inspiring. In that respect, the temple in the mountains is much like its traditional ancestors.","Wat Pha Sorn Kaew is a relatively new site, having been completed in 2004, and is not widely recognised as a tourist attraction, therefore it can be quite difficult to visit. It is located about 5 hours north of Bangkok, between the towns of Lom Sak and Phitsanulok in the Phetchabun region. At present, the only way of reaching the temple is by your own transport or on a private tour."

It has been considerably altered over the years, most notably by the young Prince Mongkut who would later become King Rama IV of Thailand. Today, the temple is the headquarters of the Mahanikai school of Buddhism, Thailand’s largest monastic order. It’s used as a center for monastic learning for members of the school who come from all across Southeast Asia. The temple is also home to the Center for Vipassana Meditation at Buddhist University, and is one of several in Bangkok that offers classes in meditations. Some programs are taught in English. Originally built to house a relic of the Buddha, Wat Mahathat is one of the oldest shrines in Bangkok. The temple is tucked away on the grounds, surrounded by a confusing layout of schools, offices, and other buildings. When you come to the entrance to the inner courtyard, push your way through the door. It tends to be closed to keep out the noise of the surrounding environs. The courtyard is packed with statues and relics, with an out-of-place garden of tall palm trees pushed to the back. Next to the temple, vendors gather every Sunday for Bangkok’s largest amulet market, where they peddle religious amulets, talismans, charms, and traditional medicine. All of the amulets have a different purpose: to restore health, to bring great wealth, or to keep enemies away, for example.","The Temple is located near Sanam Luang Park, between the Grand Palace and the National Museum.

For the past 25 years, he’s been accumulating everything from vintage Scandinavian designer furniture, creepy mannequin dolls, Chinese porcelain, retro racing bikes, life-size action hero figures, and literally thousands of other curiosities in his massive warehouse. Spread over multiple massive halls, the items are on display in a maze of mock living rooms, spacious photo studios, and huge cabinets. There is no store map or publicly visible store index, but items are placed according to some form of logic, either by era—Victorian furniture, retro furniture, and so on–or function, such as chairs, mirrors, or children’s toys. All items are technically for sale, but visitors are almost discouraged from taking anything home, as none of the items have a price tag showing, and most of the prices are surprisingly steep. In some cases, the owner might simply refuse to sell certain items, simply because they’ve become such a prized part of his collection.","Lad Phrao is one of Bangkok's lesser-visited suburbs, so the tourist infrastructure is far from developed.

27,Elephant Nature Park,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Thailand's distressed elephants find peace at this Chiang Mai sanctuary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-nature-park,"Set in Thailand’s Chiang Mai province, Elephant Nature Park provides a sanctuary to rescued elephants from around the country. Originally founded in 1990, Elephant Nature Park is roughly 60 kilometers from Chiang Mai city, tucked away in the picturesque hills of Northern Thailand. Serving as a rescue and rehabilitation center for elephants from around the country, Elephant Nature Park is—simply put—the ethical way to enjoy the company of a pachyderm when in Asia. In Thailand, elephant populations have decreased significantly from 100,000 a century ago to now a measly 3,000 estimated elephants remaining. The decline in elephant numbers is namely due to the animals being used for the tourism and logging industries, which subjects these magnificent creatures to harrowing abuse. For tourists, riding an elephant or purchasing a painting from a pachyderm may seem harmless enough, but it is the “training” techniques used to have the animals perform such feats that are cause for concern. Mahouts—a term for men who work with elephants in Southeast Asia—often subject their animals to barbaric forms of physical abuse to intimidate, scare, and ultimately break the spirit of the elephant. At Elephant Nature Park, the rescued elephants who arrive at the sanctuary can often come with broken bones, psychological issues, and baring the scars of years of abuse. The silver lining is Elephant Nature Park fights to save these animals and give them a stress-free environment where volunteers can spend time with the elephants in an ethical way. From feeding the elephants copious amounts of watermelon to walking alongside them as they meander down the river, to simply watching them play in the mud, Elephant Nature Park puts the focus on the wellbeing of its animals. In short, a visit to this sanctuary is how animal tourism should be: putting the animal first.","A visit to Elephant Nature Park requires advance booking online. Volunteers have the option of a one-day visit with the elephants, a half-day visit, or a two-day visit with an overnight stay on the property. If timing permits, it is worth spending the night at Elephant Nature Park to truly experience the beauty of this animal sanctuary and catch some extra time with the elephants. While the main draw of Elephant Nature Park is the elephants, the sanctuary is also home to cats and dogs that have been rescued from around the country. Elephant Nature Park has additional locations in Cambodia, Surin, and Kanchanaburi with different volunteer programs and lengths offered at each park."

30,Bua Tong Sticky Waterfall,"Mae Ho Phra, Thailand",You can walk up Thailand’s naturally non-slip waterfall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bua-tong-sticky-waterfall,"Thailand is full of pretty waterfalls, some big, some small, some in-between. And like most waterfalls in the world, and rivers in general, the wet rocks nearby tend to be slippery, often treacherously so. But one waterfall, Bua Tong, stands out from the crowd for offering a surprising amount of traction. Bua Tong Waterfall is a small, picturesque waterfall whose milky-white waters tumble through the surrounding jungle. It falls over three tiers, at an angle of about 45 to 50 degrees, over rocks that have a strange bubble-like appearance. If this were any normal waterfall, it would be great to slide down the slippery rocks. But people don’t come to slide down Bua Tong, known as the Sticky Waterfall by locals. Instead, they walk up it. The waterfall is fed by a calcium-rich spring at the top, which plunges down over the rocks. Over time, mineral deposits have given the rocks a pumice-like texture. So rather than being perilously slippery, the wet rocks along the Bua Tong Waterfall are actually quite rough and therefore easy to walk along—and up—even when wet. You can walk barefoot over the “sticky” rocks, which are rough but not so rough that they’ll cut or hurt your feet. You still need to watch out for some sneaky rocks that offer less traction and are therefore potentially slippery. These tend to be grayer in color than the surrounding rocks. The waterfall is a popular spot among locals, especially on the weekend, but is still quite light on tourists. So you can normally make the ascent without any crowds, enjoying the refreshing water and the jungle scenery as you walk up the Sticky Waterfall. And if you feel like walking some more afterward, there’s a trail from near the top of the falls to Nam Phu Chet Si, a sacred spring and shrine in the jungle. Its supposedly healing waters contain the same calcium carbonate that made Bua Tong sticky.","Bua Tong Waterfall is located about 20 miles north (as the crow flies) of Chiang Mai, which is the largest city in northern Thailand and the capital of Chiang Mai Province. To get to the waterfall from Chiang Mai, head north along highway 1001. Stay on the highway and after about an hour and a half you’ll see a sign telling you to turn right for Bua Tong Waterfall. After that it’s a short drive to the falls. You can get there easily by taxi, motorbike or tour. There is no entrance fee to the Sticky Waterfall. Opening hours are from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m."

The resort stands alone at the end of a road off the main highway, over 18 miles from the nearest city, which itself is a tiny market town near the border of Myanmar with no amenities for tourists. However once arrived at the resort guests can sleep in fully stocked dwellings shaped like colossal pineapple, dragonfruit, durian, mangosteen, mushroom, bamboo shoots, and more, all the while surrounded by orchards growing the real deal. Clearly a lover of sweet produce, the owner plans to attract school groups and clubs interested in horticulture and nature. Twelve years ago, he began collecting rare fruit varieties from all over Thailand to plant on the 80 acre property, as well as exotic flowers from abroad. In particular, he focused on durian, a fruit whose bizarre combination of lethally sharp spikes and pungent aroma makes an instant impression (it is also known as the “corpse fruit”). Now the site cultivates over 100 varieties of the stinky fruit, making it one of only a few places in Thailand that serves as a genetic bank. Visitors seek who want to taste durian should visit in late May or June. In addition to the quirky fruit buildings, nearby attractions include a small waterfall, a natural hot spring, some beautiful misty mountains.

32,Cabbages & Condoms,"Bangkok, Thailand",A condom-covered Thai restaurant that is more concerned with birth control than food.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cabbages-condoms,"Eccentric theme restaurants dot the Asian landscape, focusing on everything from cats to toilets to robots, but only Bangkok’s Cabbages & Condoms brings an obsession with prophylactics to the table. Founded by politician and family planning activist Mechai Viravaidya (who is also known by the nickname “Mr. Condom”) the large restaurant was opened next to one of the few family planning clinics in Bangkok that offers abortions for the impoverished women in the community. While pregnancy termination is allowed by law in the city, it is often thought to be illegal and contraceptive measures, in general, are often seen as taboo, thus Viravaidya started his restaurant with the intention of raising understanding and acceptance of birth control (as well as to serve food). This devotion to the titular form of protection can be seen in the ubiquitous condoms decorating almost every corner of the eatery. From the small gift area near the entrance featuring informational pamphlets on family planning and a visual guide to varieties of condoms to mannequins covered in dresses made of prophylactics and studded by birth control pills, diners are surrounded on all sides by rubber reminders of safe sex. Lampshades, wall decorations, and even Christmas tree trimmings are constructed out of the proverbial raincoats, giving guests no place to rest their eyes that doesn’t have some playful new use for the protective device. Then at the end of the meal, diners are given their own condom in lieu of dinner mints. While the almost cartoonishly overblown presentation of condoms in the restaurant seems silly, the purpose is to make the otherwise taboo item more mundane and less exotic, and the gambit seems to be working. Along with a number of other initiatives begun by Viravaidya, Cabbages & Condoms has contributed to a staggering decrease in children being born to Bangkok families.

In the humid buzz of Thailand’s capital, this urban farm and fish pond within a fine-dining restaurant take sustainability to a new level. Pass through a long driveway framed by edible flowers in a remote corner of Bangkok’s Asoke neighborhood and you’ll arrive at what claims to be the first urban farm and zero-waste restaurant in the country. A server will take you on a tour of both the aquaponic and vertical farms that together supply some of the menu’s produce. A large koi pond stretches the length of the building. The evaporation from the pond keeps the building cool while the waste from the fish (which appear on the menu themselves) is circulated throughout the aquaponic section to deliver nutrients to more delicate produce such as mizuna, mint, borage, and dill. The chic restaurant was designed with juxtaposition in mind. The serene dining room is nestled within the bustle of Asoke, with warm wooden accents tempering the edge of black metal. Simple produce from the farm is transformed into edible works of art, often using complex molecular techniques. Neo-Indian tasting menus using hyper-local Thai ingredients highlight head chef Deepanker Khosla’s expertise while also employing the farm’s multitude of fresh fish and greens. A refined galouti kebab dish is enhanced by citrus gel and Thai truffles, while a dish called “Prawns on the Rock” couples tamarind with peanut and lime foam. “Haoma in a Bite” is comprised solely of ingredients harvested from the premises: house carp gets topped with mustard greens and a seven-herbed chlorophyll jelly before kombucha SCOBY crisps are crested atop. In the name of zero waste, much of the cocktails are made up of scraps from the kitchen. Strawberries (along with their oft-discarded stems) are juiced and hardened into the fruit leather that graces the simply named “Strawberry” cocktail, while the tongue-in-cheek “Kale” slips gin into a blend of up-cycled avocado, kale, apple, and celery. This secluded, verdant pocket of Bangkok may have just cracked the sustainable restaurant code. With Haoma racking up an impressive list of awards, diners may have to make reservations weeks in advance for a tasting course of the future.",
34,Phra Prang Sam Yot,"Tambon Tha Hin, Thailand",Monkeys lounge around at this 13th century temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phra-prang-sam-yot,"The new residents of Phra Prang Sam Yot aren’t Buddhists or Hindus, they’re primates. Phra Prang Sam Yot is a 13th century temple built by the Khmer King Jayavarman VII. It was originally used as a Buddhist temple, converted to a temple to Shiva after Jayavarman’s death, then repurposed for Buddhism again in the 1600s, all of which is evident in its multi-symbolic architecture. It remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in the old city of Lopburi, but not for its religious significance or cultural history. It’s because of the monkeys. The temple has been overrun by macaques. This may have started because of the annual Monkey Buffet Festival that occurs in the city, during which locals give them fruits and vegetables. Now the monkey population is over 2,000, and most of them live in the temple in relative isolation from the human population. However, living in such close quarters with humans has made them unafraid to snatch treats and personal belongings right out of your hands. Their aggression has gotten serious enough that the city has designated officials to feed them at specific times during the day so that they won’t attack tourists.",
35,"Wat Saam Prasob, the Sunken Temple","Tambon Nong Lu, Thailand","During the rainy season, this temple is almost entirely submerged, accessible only by boat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-saam-prasob-sunken-temple,"When the Vajiralongkorn Dam in Thailand was constructed in 1984, there was great consternation in the Mon community living near the dam site. Members of the Mon tribe, who had fled nearby Myanmar to escape the continuous conflicts taking place there, lived in a small village along the border between the two countries. But after the construction of the dam most of the village was flooded, and the refugees had to find a new place to live, in a country that was not their own. The only structure from the submerged town that remains today is the Waat Sam Prasob shrine, also known as the Sunken Temple or the Wat Wang Wiwekaram. Built by the Mon and Karen tribes, it was once the heart of the old town. Today, during the rainy season when the reservoir levels are high, the top half and the steeple are the only parts of the temple that are visible, and a boat ride takes you around the curious structure. When the region is drier, it is possible to walk around and inside to take a closer look at the ruins. Luangpo Uttama, the abbot of the old temple who was himself a Mon refugee, helped the Mon people relocate to their current location in the Ban Wangka village, opposite the town of Sangkhlaburi. A wooden bridge spanning 1,300 feet was built to connect the two settlements, named Uttama Nusorn after the abbot who was instrumental in the development of the region. It is the longest wooden bridge in Thailand and is thought to be the second longest in the world. Popularly called the Mon bridge or Saphan Mon, it was built over the Songkalia river and overlooks a scenic landscape, making it a favorite of tourists and photographers. Vehicles are not allowed on the bridge but it is possible to walk across and visit the Mon village.",It is accessible through bus or car from Kanchanaburi. There are many guest houses next to the old bridge.
36,Wat Tha Ka Rong,"Tambon Ban Pom, Thailand",A colorful kitschy temple and floating market off the beaten path.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-tha-ka-rong,"Situated on the banks of the Chao Phraya river away from the tourist centre of Ayutthaya, Wat Tha Ka Rong, aka The Temple of the Blackbird or the Monastery of the Landing of the Crying Crow, is an unexpected novelty away from the of the main city centre. Formerly a campsite for Burmese troops in the White Elephant War, it is made up of a temple, Wat Tha, and a monastery, Wat Ka Rong. The site dates back to around the mid-16th century. Although still a working religious site, Wat Tha Ka Rong is an assault on the senses, it’s unique blend of colour, kitsch and sometimes downright crazy, meaning that it really should be a must see on anyone’s list when visiting Thailand’s former capital. Imagine a temple, crossed with a British seaside amusement arcade, add about 72491 animal/superhero statues and you have some idea of this place looks like—and that’s before you get to the floating market. The floating market at the temple offers some of Thailand’s best loved dishes at super cheap prices— think plates of Pad Thai, Moo Satay (pork with peanut sauce) and Som Tam (papaya salad). After gorging yourself on food, head down to the side of the river and buy bags of fish food that looks like colourful polystyrene pieces. Here you can throw them to the catfish who climb all over each other just to get a scrap. And not to worry if you need to use the bathroom here, thanks to it’s innovative design, Wat Tha Ka Rong also proudly boasts the Thailand ‘Best Toilet Award.’ At the time of writing, Wat Tha Ka Rong is mostly frequented by locals and there aren’t that many visitors from outside of Thailand, meaning that this temple offers a much more authentic experience than Ayutthaya’s main tourist-orientated floating market. Another plus point of Tha Ka Rong is that it does not offer the dubious animal attractions of it’s larger competitor, which can be challenging viewing for the average western traveller.","Wat Tha Ka Rong is open all week, but to see all of it’s attractions it is best to go on a weekend, as this is when the floating market is open. Before Bangkok, Ayutthaya was the capital city of Thailand and is still a popular tourist destination. Therefore, it is very easy to get to. A bus from Mo Chit or Victory Monument will set you back around 80 – 100 Thai Baht and takes less than two hours. If you’re looking for a scenic journey, the train from Hualamphong station takes 2.5 hours and is even cheaper – only 22 baht. Ayutthaya is also very easy to reach from other cities in Central Thailand.Once you arrive in Ayutthaya, the most popular way to see the attractions is by bike. Wat Tha Ka Rong isn’t on all of the tourist maps, but locals will be happy to add it for you. If cycling isn’t your bag, tuk-tuks are all around the centre of Ayutthaya, and you should be able to get to the Temple for around 200 baht."
37,Baan Dam - Black House,"Nang Lae, Thailand","An entire elephant skeleton, snake skin table runner, and thousands of animal remains become art in Thailand's Black House.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/black-temple,"Everything at Baan Dam is black, or at least gives off a dark aura, and each one of the 15 houses is embellished and furnished with animal remains. Artist Thawan Duchanee created an impressive collection of skins, bones, teeth and taxidermy of a wide array of animals. The animal remains are intricately arranged, giving off a beautifully unique yet mysterious tribal vibe. There is a conflict of emotion, between appreciation of art and a sense of evil, coming from the dead animals. Supposedly they all died from natural causes; an idea that makes the place more spiritual and less sadistic. The main temple is a large wooden structure. The black tiered roof has curvy metal points jutting from the sides. Inside, the wooden infrastructure is aesthetically exposed. In the center a long wooden table with benches on both sides is lined with an incredibly long snakeskin runner. One hut, designed like a Budhist stupa, contains a circular room, lined with chairs made of buffalo horns and skin. The centerpiece is a giant crocodile skin, painted black and surrounded by candles. The room is known to reverberate and amplify sound. Maybe the most fascinating and sadistic architecture is the submarine-shaped building. Like most of the buildings, it is not open for entry, but windows provide ample light to view its contents, revealing what seems to be a torture chamber. Baan Dam is Thawan Duchanee’s artful portrayal of hell. The opaque decor and dead animals adorning each room make Duchanee’s estate the complete opposite of the White Temple, the glimpse of heaven designed by his teacher Chalermchai Kositpipat.  Although off the beaten track, the Black Temple is not something to be overlooked.","Renting a motorcycle or scooter will be the easiest way here (though directions via bus are below). From Chiang Rai’s Central Plaza or the Princess Mother’s Garden, head north on route 1 (Phaholyothin road). After crossing the Kok river (just north of the Princess Mother’s Garden), go 8.4 kilometers – you’re looking for a brown wooden sign and a brown wooden awning on the left. This will have three lines of Thai text and the number 13 (for Moo 13, the side street number). Take the left just before the sign, then go about 450 meters – you’re looking for the first left turn that isn’t someone’s driveway. Next, go 300 meters – you’ll see some of the sights on the left and a parking lot on the right.If taking the bus, start from the central bus terminal (near Phaholyothin and Prasopsook’s intersection, GPS: 19.904716,99.834222) and ask around to find the right bus (most likely, around platform 5 or 6). Note you’ll want to use the Thai name (Baan Dam) – asking around for the Black House here is likely to elicit puzzled looks. The locals know this place, and will get you off the bus at the right time. If you’re playing along with a smartphone, of course, tap the GPS coordinates and follow the bus as it goes north. Once you’re off the bus, hopefully near the side road, follow the directions as above. Expect the bus to take about 30 minutes."

At the end of the cavern lies a stalagmite that resembles a woman holding a child. In front of that is a stalactite shaped like a heart. A legend says a woman once stood here waiting for her lover to return, and when he he did, she turned to stone. Some say the woman is Princess Aranyani who fled with her child to protect her lover, who was a commoner. There are also two colorful Buddha shrines in the cave, which was formed millions of years ago from the limestone in that region. Today the walls are illuminated by multicolored lights which bathe the limestone in bright colors.","The cave is especially popular during the Songkran celebration in mid-April. During this time, a festival is held in the cave. However, it is important to note that the cave is mostly submerged during the rainy season. It is best to visit in the dry season if you want to walk the full length of the cave. This site can be reached only by car. It is about 40km north of Phray City. Drive along Highway 101 at km 59.

Known formally as Mahaminh Sakayamunee Visejchaicharn, informally as Phra Buddha Maha Nawamin, and simply as the Big Buddha, Wat Muang’s Buddha stands at an eye-watering 92 meters tall and 63 meters wide. Completed in 2008, the enormous statue towers above the surrounding, sparsely populated farmland. As the original Wat Muang was destroyed during the ransacking of the former Thai capital Ayutthaya by the Burmese in the 18th century, the temple’s exact origins are unknown. After years of work, the reconstruction of Wat Muang was completed in 1982. In 1990, work started on the Big Buddha and was completed 18 years later, costing around 131 million Thai Baht (around $3.75 million). The giant concrete structure is finished with gold paint and casts its shadow over not only the Wat Muang monastery and temple, but also the surrounding “Hell Garden” featuring statues depicting various scenes from Buddhist Hell. Other nearby sculptures on display memorialize the Gods and Kings and Thailand and commemorate events from the Burmese-Siamese War. As well as the garden, visitors can enjoy the Viharn Kaew (glass ordination hall), a chamber decorated from floor to ceiling with mirrored mosaic tiles that houses a Buddha made of solid silver.","As Ang Thong is a region in Thailand that plays host to a small amount of tourists compared with the likes of Bangkok, Chiang Mai and the Southern Gulf, it can be quite difficult to get to Wat Muang. From Bangkok (116km away) or Ayutthaya (44km away) it is best to take a minivan (this is a very common way for people Thais to travel) and ask to be dropped off in Ang Thong. From Ang Thong, it is then possible to rent a car or a motorcycle to complete the remainder of the journey by taking the A 3064 and A 3195 west, a journey of less than 20 minutes from Ang Thong center. The Buddha dominates the skyline and can easily be seen from the road."

41,Wat Tham Pla,"Tambon Pong Ngam, Thailand",A Buddhist shrine in a cave protected by macaques next to dark passages lined with creepy paintings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-tham-pla,"Wat Tham Pla (Cave Fish Temple) is a deceptively small Buddhist complex consisting of several incongruous elements. A limestone cliff rises abruptly next to a clearing, where you’ll find a cave of fish, crocodile pond, ancient monument, Buddhist Hell statues, and many many monkeys. At the cave, Tham Pla, a stream of fresh water forms a pond that extends outside the cavern. As the name suggests, it has plenty of fish swimming in it. Not far from there, an artificial enclosed pond is home to some crocodiles. (Unfortunately a sad sight as the enclosure is obviously too small.) But neither the fish nor the crocodiles dominate the scene. Macaques do. A troop of irascible macaques wields supreme power over the whole compound—so much so that this location is sometimes referred to as the “Monkey Temple.” Street vendors offer snacks and drinks on the main clearing, from which the ordination hall can be seen. The backdrop of the hall is an ancient monument with graceful decorations—the line of canaries is particularly beautiful. Adjacent to the ordination hall are some cartoonish statues portraying scenes from Buddhist Hell. A weathered stairway adorned with two nagas (mythological snakes) leads to a shrine inside the cave. Go beyond the shrine and you’ll find narrow, slippery passages with bats fluttering around your head, and the smell of guano filling your lungs. Follow these passageways to get to recesses with creepy paintings lurking in the dark. If the objective of these paintings was to evoke dread, they exceed expectations.","Wat Tham Pla is located in Ban Huai Poo Kaeng, a village about 12.5 miles (20 km) before Highway 1149 reaches the Thai-Myanmar border. Be extra careful around macaques, especially if you have anything in your hands. A stick is sometimes given to visitors to fend them off. Hiking boots are recommended for entering the cave. At times, you can find a monk sitting near the entrance lending lanterns to visitors, but to be on the safe side, you should bring your own torch."

After climbing a short staircase on the Western edge of the canyon hikers will see a narrow ridge of Earth, all that remains of a walking path through the canyon. Erosion on either side of the path has caused the forest level to drop dramatically with only the tips of the plants rising above the level of the path. With drops of up to 30 meters on either side of the strange trail, traversing it can be dangerous. The walk up to the first viewpoint is easily accessible to anyone even with a moderate level of fitness. However, the paths leading further vary widely in width, steepness, and danger. At points, the width of the land narrows to little more than foot wide ridges that must be scrambled across. At other points, the paths turns almost vertical and requires some climbing to go farther. Despite the slight dangers of the Pai Canyon it is a popular attraction in the region.","The entry to Pai Canyon is located on Road 1095. Going north, Pai Canyon is located 8 km. before entering Pai (town).Pai Canyon is the most popular spot in the area to watch the sunset. If you are hoping to avoid crowds, don't come at this time.

Unless, of course the gods had decided to adorn the entire island with precious stones. Which according to Thai mythology, they did. Precious, indeed, because the Gods—precisely the god of Tarutao, a Thai deity—is said to have placed a curse onto the island. Any visitor who would dared to take even a pebble off the island would be cursed forever. Each year the the National Park office which manages the island receives dozens of stones returned via mail, sent back by people who want to lift the curse. The stones of Koh Hingham must stay on Koh Hingham or you risk the wrath of Tarutao. Even though you cannot take the stones home, you can play with them within the boundaries of the island for as long as your inner child wishes to do so. Thai people, for example, use them to build miniaturized cheddis and kneeling in front of them, they lay their most ardent wishes and prayers.

The World Museum of Insects and Natural Wonders is the work of husband and wife team Manop Ratana Rittirong Gul, and Rattana Rumpa Rittirong Gul, both former contributors to the Smithsonian. Rattana is a world leader in mosquito research and has contributed almost 500 species of mosquito to the world record, while her husband is a malaria expert. Together they are a husband and wife bug superteam. The walls of their small, multi-floor museum are covered in glass frames full of pinned insects of all varieties including stick insects, beetles, butterflies, and more. Each of the displays is annotated both by scientific info and personal asides. In addition to the insectoid taxidermy, the museum features a number of surreal works of art by the duo. There are paintings of women and horses cavorting with giant mosquitoes and rocks that are described as the eyes and meteors. Together, the eccentric collection is both surreal and a bit creepy. The pieces of art are also given informational plaques, but they are mostly filled with personal bits of mysticism that relate to the making and meaning of the works. It’s not every museum that allows such an unvarnished look into the minds of its curators, and the combination of the clinical and personal at the site make for a strange, and unforgettable mixture.","72 Srimankalajarn Road Nimmanhemin Soi 13 Muang Chiangmai, Mueang Chiang Mai District, Thailand"

The swing was originally built in 1784, under the direction of King Rama I. Since then weather damage has required several restorations, including a recent renovation completed in 2007. For this project, workers used six massive teak tree trunks (each more than 20 meters tall and approximately 200 years old) to construct a new swing. For centuries, the Giant Swing played a central role in annual swing ceremonies that symbolically reenacted elements of Hindu origin stories. In Hindu mythology Brahma tested the stability of the newly created world by ordering Shiva to stand on a mountain while giant snakes tried to shake him to the ground. The swing ceremony had teams of Thai men in elaborate headdresses competing to launch themselves into the air, where they would use their teeth catch a sack of coins tied to the top of a pole 25 meters (or more) above the ground. The stability of the swing and presumed success of the swingers represented the unshakable Shiva of Hindu legend. Unfortunately, the ceremony was discontinued in 1935 after several participants fell to their deaths. In 2005 the Giant Swing and Wat Suthat were nominated as a future UNESCO World Heritage Site.",

At Jok’s Kitchen, there’s no menu. Rather, make a reservation a month or two in advance, and Mr. Jok himself will decide what you’ll eat for dinner. While Jok’s backstory is a bit of a mystery, rumor has it that he grew up in a family of successful Thai-Chinese seafood exporters, giving him access to the greatest seafood restaurants in Bangkok. He picked up bits and pieces of culinary expertise from chefs until, as an adult, he’d attained somewhat of a mastery over Thai-Chinese seafood. After the crowds have cleared the wet market in Bangkok’s Chinatown, one light stays on: Jok’s original family shophouse, where he curates nightly meals for a small batch of lucky gourmands. Warning: The food does come out fast, so make sure your whole party is on time. Again, you won’t need to order anything, but you may need to ask directions when winding through the often unmarked streets of Bangkok’s Chinatown. While no two nights repeat themselves at Jok’s, fried gingko nuts, pickled mustard greens, or Cantonese wontons often commence the meal. Smoked duck, prawn-topped spicy lemongrass salad, prawn dumplings, or Thai-curried sea-crab may greet you as the meal gains momentum. The evening frequently climaxes with a larger main of grouper and plum soup, deep-fried cod, stir-fried kale with salted halibut, or, the crowd favorite, shelled giant crab with a selection of East Asian dipping sauces.

They are bats, thousands upon thousands of them emerging to hunt insects as they do every night here in eastern Thailand. Along the rolling landscape, low and craggy cliffs rise from rice and manioc fields. Over eons the limestone outcrops of these cliffs have been eroded into labyrinthine tunnels and caves. This unusual karst topography has created the ideal refuge for many thousands of bats. Feeding on an ample supply of insects in this agricultural region, they act in many ways as a natural form of biological pest control. Revered and respected by villagers, some of the bat caves are even honored by monks. Below one monastery, giant statues of the Buddha seated in the lotus position gaze out of the inky darkness. Overhead, hundreds of bats chirp and jostle in their roost, sleeping away the day in anticipation for the night hunt. On the edge of Khao Yai National Park you can visit these caves and watch from the fields as the bats emerge to hunt at twilight. At first, only a faint trickle of black shapes is discernible from the cliffs, but soon a huge and unmistakable river of bats weaves over the fields like a snake. Like one living creature, the bats contort as a school of tiny fish might from the narrow opening of this cave system. At the entrance to the cave, raptors congregate in anticipation of an easy meal. As they dive toward the bats, the line opens and separates before joining together again in a twisting ribbon. This spectacle occurs for hours every night before the last bats exit the caves. Established in 1962, the second largest National Park in Thailand, Khao Yai is located about four hours from Bangkok in Thailand’s Nakhon Ratchasima Province.

Almost three decades ago, one monk and his acolytes had grown tired of the mounting litter in the Sisaket area near Cambodia. To promote recycling and cleaning the landscape, the monks encouraged everyone in the area to bring them recycled beer bottles to create a temple complex. Using mostly green Heineken  and Chang beer bottles and brown Leo (the local favorite) beer bottles, the monks began with a temple and later formed a crematorium, water towers, sleeping quarters and even toilets. Pushed into the concrete of the walls, the recycled bottles form every detail of the buildings inside and out. Aside from whole bottles, the monks also incorporated bottle caps to create mosaics and Buddhist designs inside of the temple. Today, the monks have no plans to stop building.

50,Sala Keoku,"Tambon Wat That, Thailand",Bizarre Hindu and Buddhist sculpture park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nong-khai-sculpture-park,"Luang Pu’s ascent to fame follows a strange and murky path. Pu was born in 1932 in Laos, and became a mystic early in his life. According to his legend, he fell through a sinkhole onto his teacher’s lap, and remained there for many years learning as much as he could. Although Pu was never ordained as a monk, by the end of his life he had amassed a solid group of religious followers and was recognized as a spiritual leader. To express his spiritual feelings, he began work on a sculpture park in Laos, until he left the country in 1974, which some attribute to the communist presence in Laos at the time. Moving across the border to Thailand, Pu purchased land in Nong Khai and began a project that would take him 20 years to complete. Crafting sculptures of all kinds, Pu attempted to tell the myths and legends of both Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. Some of his sculptures are 100 feet high, and tend towards depicting the frightening and grotesque, as evidenced by his skeleton sculptures and snake statues that are prevalent in the park. Each sculpture was carefully designed with a purpose in mind. Many visitors are especially struck by his work representing the life cycle. People enter into a birth canal, where statues depict life from conception to death. Designed as a circle, the wheel of birth and rebirth continues forever unless one is able to escape the cycle through nirvana. As he got older, Pu was still set on overseeing his work, and was brought to the park in a wheelbarrow to supervise. In 1996, Pu’s health was failing, and after an accident falling from one of his statues, he passed away.

51,Rafflesia,"Khlong Sok, Thailand",Surat Thani's official flower—and the world's largest—smells of rotting meat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rafflesia-flower,"The magnificent Rafflesia, the largest flowers in the world, can grow up to 40 inches in diameter, sporting dramatic reddish petals that smell like rotting meat. Like a giant red bowl lined with yellow spotted petals, Rafflesia exude a strong smell that is similar to what you might expect to find near long-rotting carcasses. Not pollinated by insects seeking nectar, Rafflesia is believed to be pollinated by flies. The flowers are endoparasites that require the presence of Tetrastigma (wild grape vine) hosts, without which they will not grow. The Rafflesia was first noted by British naturalist Joseph Arnold, and named for the leader of the expedition, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. The Rafflesia arnoldii was later named in Arnold’s honor. It has since been named the official flower of Surat Thani province, but habitat losses and collection by humans are causing numbers to dwindle. The cooked buds or flowers of the Rafflesia can be used to help fever or a backache or even as a sexual stimulant, however, western medicine doesn’t recognize any medical use for the flower. The largest species of Rafflesia, Rafflesia arnoldii, does not grow in Thailand, but three other large species do - and they are celebrated by the national park, where they can be found in abundance. The Rafflesia is a distant relative of the other gigantic “corpse flower”, the Amorphophallus titanum.",
52,Counterfeit Goods Museum,"Bangkok, Thailand","A museum in a law office, filled with authentic and counterfeit goods.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/counterfeit-goods-museum,"The Counterfeit Goods Museum in Bangkok, Thailand is in a somewhat unconventional location for a museum: the working law office of Tilleke & Gibbins. Guests are greeted by a guide when they step off the elevator and onto the 26th floor of the downtown skyscraper. It is then that it all begins to make sense. The guide, who is also an employee of the law office, explains that companies hire the firm to find and stop the counterfeiting of their products. The museum is made up of original items donated by the firm’s clients, as well as the counterfeit goods that have been acquired during raids. Most of the counterfeit goods are used as evidence in intellectual property court cases before making their way into the museum. While the museum collection consists of roughly 3,500 confiscated items, there is only enough space to show 500 at a time. The counterfeit items range from brand name clothing and accessories (Gucci, Ed Hardy, Adidas, etc.), to food products, toys (such as Dragon Ball Z figurines), cell phones, books, and even automobile parts. The museum alleges that 95% of knock-off goods are made in China, and that an illegal shipment was once seized at the Thai border containing 150,000 pairs of shoes! Also on display are replica Casio calculators. For anyone going calculator shopping, keep an eye out for impostors – real Casio calculators do not have a CE button. Aside from sharing tips on spotting replica items, the guide also drives home the fact that counterfeit products can be dangerous. Automobile parts, food, or electronics with no safety testing or regulations can be disastrous. Ironically, upon leaving the museum, one needs to walk no more then a few blocks before encountering counterfeit goods. As it is in a working law office, the museum accepts guests by appointment only.",

Over 20 years later, his body remains incredibly well-preserved. In death, the self-mummified monk is housed in the charming Thai town temple of Wat Khunaram on Ko Samui Island in Thailand. Monks at the temple put sunglasses over the mummy’s sunken, empty sockets in order to make him less disturbing to visiting children and others who come to pay their respects. Radiographs of the mummy have revealed that he still wears his dentures and that in death he has become a hatchery for a native gecko species.

54,Wat Umong,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Buddha shrines hide within dark tunnels at this unique forest temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-umong,"In a city full of wats (Buddhist temples), Wat Umong is the most unique and least-visited in Chiang Mai. Tucked away on the western edge of town in the forested mountain foothills, this wat contains a network of centuries-old tunnels still used by Buddhist monks. Local lore states that the wat was founded in the 13th century by King Mangrai. The king regularly met with a monk in Chiang Mai, who preferred to meditate inside of a tunnel. As the city grew and the monk found it harder to find quiet refuge in his subterranean sanctuary, King Mangrai ordered a system of tunnels be built on the forested edge of town. Archaeological evidence and written sources conflict with this original legend. Instead, the style of painting within the tunnels as well as the architecture of the stupa above match the period between 1380-1450. This is supported by a written text called the Banha Thera Jan, which tells how King Kuena offered the monk Jan a position at Wat Umong and had the tunnels constructed for him. Soon, this network of tunnels had sprouted into a fully functioning temple. Wat Umong remained active until the 15th century, when it was mysteriously abandoned. In 1900, the stupa was broken and its relics looted. Reconstruction efforts began in 1948, including repairing the stupa and clearing dirt built up a meter high from the tunnel system. Unfortunately, this also destroyed many of the paintings that lined the tunnel walls. Today the wat is an active center, used by monks and locals. The tunnel system once again contains various shrines. There’s also a large, somewhat rare statue of the fasting Buddha sitting atop one of the tunnels and hiding among the trees. The forest is dotted with Buddhist sayings nailed to trees and old, decaying statues of the Buddha are scattered about the grounds. Visitors to Wat Umong will also find a pretty lake, a spiritual center, a small museum, and lots of chickens roaming around.","The wat is a few miles outside of the old town. You can use a taxi, songathew, tuk tuk, or bicycle to get there. If you pay someone to drive you there, arrange for them to wait while you explore the grounds, as this is not a popular tourist spot and return transportation will not be easy to find. Please dress conservatively and act respectfully, in accordance with local customs, as this is an active wat."
55,The Abandoned Bangkok Mansions,"Tambon Phra Prathom Chedi, Thailand",Abandoned mini-mansions that were once intended for affluent Bangkok families now sit empty.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-abandoned-bangkok-mansions,"Rising from a moist field on a patch of land just outside of Bangkok, five blotched concrete mini-mansions have sat abandoned for over 20 years.  The mansions were once part of a planned upscale subdivision construction project to build homes for the wealthy in the quiet suburb of Nakhon Pathom, just a stones-throw away from the bustling capital city. These abandoned homes are one of many casualties of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, with the construction company filing for bankruptcy mid-build.  The 300 rai (120 acres) of land surrounding the homes has become more expensive in recent years, its price has skyrocketed after the 2011 floods.  The area was proven to not be affected by floodwaters that ravaged the region, deeming it a safe location to construct homes & businesses. The houses meant for the affluent, now host two families of modest means who have been living rent-free as caretakers of the property for the past 15 years. The company that owns the site provides the caretakers with free electricity & water, along with a small monthly stipend. The caretaker families occupy two of the houses nearest the road, while the three others in the back of the property, including the largest with a pool and wet-bar, remain boarded up and unoccupied. According to the patriarch of one family, the uninhabited dwellings are seen as haunted, with the families keeping clear of them for the most part. The people there are very kind & welcoming, common traits of many ‘everyday’ people living in rural areas across the Kingdom. The family members happily go about their daily routines of washing up, preparing food, playing with pets, and doing some motorbike maintenance. The interiors are sparse of furnishings, aside from basic necessities, but the inhabitants live pleasantly with plenty of living space for their extended families.","The abandoned Bangkok mansions are on private property and currently home to families acting as caretakers. While the mansions can be admired from afar, it is not encouraged to trespass."
56,Bo Sang Umbrella Village,"San Kamphaeng, Thailand","Peek into the world of those creating the beautiful, delicate paper parasols found all over the globe.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bo-sang-umbrella-village,"Just outside the tourist paradise of Chiang Mai, Thailand lies the small craft village of Bo Sang (sometimes spelled “Bor Sang”), famous for its handmade paper umbrellas whose brilliant designs are mysteriously, magically impervious to rain. A trip to Bo Sang allows visitors a rare glimpse inside the delicate process of making these brilliant, artfully decorated umbrellas that have become instantly recognizable the world over. Once coveted by fair-skinned, delicate ladies for as protection from the sun, today none of their value has been lost even as tanned skin has grown to dominate the fashion world. For the wary, let it be known that a trip to Bo Sang is anything but an Upton Sinclair-esque look at the harsh reality behind something beautiful. Rather, the curious can wander through a town whose entire purpose seems to have united in the proud creation of lovely paper umbrellas. By the end of the day, a portrait emerges of how these meticulously hand-painted final products are assembled from piles of bamboo struts and sheets of paper made from mulberry bark. Of course, visitors are given the option to purchase umbrellas from the village gift shop after wandering around. A further, additional opportunity exists for one of the skilled, local artisans to hand-paint a customized design of your choosing on various items such as fans, mobile phone covers, purses, etc. The Bor Sang Umbrella Festival, held every January, enlivens the village with festivities. A parade streams through the village’s narrow main street, led by dancers and bicyclists (all wielding umbrellas, obviously), including the cycle-mounted contestants competing in the Miss Bo Sang Beauty Pageant, whose winner is crowned at the culmination of the festival.",
57,Wat Pa Thewapithak,"Tambon Pa Fa, Thailand","The skeletons, demons, and corpses serve as a warning of the terrors of Buddhist Hell.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-pa-thewapithak,"Wat Pa Thewapithak, a hellish amusement park located at a Buddhist temple, isn’t the only terrifying theme park of its kind. There are Buddhist Hell parks in Singapore, in Vietnam, and all throughout Thailand. Many of the parks are operated by Buddhist temples, where they function as a cautionary tale. Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike visit the hell parks to see the torture that awaits them in the next life in Naraka, the realm of hell where the worst of the worst spend eons as retribution for bad karma. If the generally terrible quality of the statuary isn’t enough to frighten you by itself, perhaps its depictions of all the tortures of the hell awaiting unfaithful believers will do the trick. Witness skeletons, demons, corpses, and other monstrosities; behold a variety of tortures (eyes gouged out, entrails spilled, limbs hacked off, torsos impaled). Each gruesome diorama has a small box where, at the insertion of a 1 baht coin, tinny screams, macabre laughter, and sonorous diatribes will blast from a small loudspeaker. Some of the dioramas are even automated, as the 1 baht coin will also activate motors that will jerkily tug the highly visible strings attached to the statues. While there are large and presumably educational banners posted frequently throughout the park, those unable to read Thai will find them unhelpful. Even more unfortunately, caged animals are kept in dark, dingy corners. The miniature Angkor Wat labyrinth, on the other hand, is well worth the 90 seconds it takes to duck through its child-size doorways, as it is strewn with some decent recreations of Apsara’s and other Buddhist and Hindu iconography, as well as, for an unknown reason, the bust of a stoic Native American chief. As with all tourist attractions in Thailand, food and drink vendors abound on site.","Wat Pa Thewapithak is a easily visible on the West side of highway 216 running North from the city of Roi Et. It's about 8km North of the city limits; there is no transit available, but if you have a motorbike you will see its brightly coloured walls and gate after about a 10 minute drive. It will be recognizeable as it is really on the highway; you do not need to follow a turn off at all. There is also a small cluster of statues right inside the entrance thanking visitors for coming and welcoming them to the area. You can get a taxi or tuktuk from the city but it would be wise to negotiate for them to wait for you and bring you back as there are no tuktuks waiting there or in any nearby areas. 200 baht should be the absolute upper limit for a full return journey. If you're quite adventurous you can walk it, but the highway is busy with a lot of traffic. The shoulder is wide and paved but there are often dogs along the side of the road who have varying degrees of friendliness towards pedestrians."
58,Elephant Building,"Bangkok, Thailand",This Bangkok high-rise looks like a rudimentary LEGO elephant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-building,"Elephants have played a central role in Thai society for many centuries. So when someone decided to build a high-rise in the shape of an elephant in Bangkok’s business district, well, it seemed like a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Bangkok is home to more than 80 completed skyscrapers, a record surpassed by only a few other cities in the world. So for a high-rise building to get noticed, it has to be a little special. And in Thailand, few things are considered more special than elephants. Such was the thinking of engineer and real estate mogul Arun Chaisaree and architect Ong-ard Satrabhandhu when they decided to collaborate on a new building in the Chatuchak District of the Thai capital. Chaisaree, in particular, was well versed in all things elephant, having previously opened his own museum to exhibit his collection of more than 2,000 elephant-shaped art objects. The Elephant Building, also known as the Chang Building, was completed in 1997. It consists of three towers (A, B, and C) joined across the top by a horizontal band of residential suites. Two of the towers form the legs of the “elephant,” while the third represents its trunk. The towers contain 32 floors, reaching a total height of 335 feet. Further details add to the overall elephant effect. The tusks on either side of the trunk contain the offices of the building’s management company. Its eyes are two huge circular windows. Its ears are multistory balconies, and its tail, which runs down the “rear” of the building, is formed by 20 stories of smoked-glass enclosed rooms. Reaction to the Elephant Building has been mixed, especially internationally. CNN soon added it to its list of the world’s 25 great skyscrapers, arguing that “at the time of its completion it was cutting edge, offering high-tech offices, a shopping plaza and a floor of luxury residential suites.” Architectural Digest, meanwhile, has since listed it among the “31 Ugliest Skyscrapers in the World,” noting that “While playful in design, the structure does little to push the integrity of Thai architecture.” Still, it’s hard to hold a grudge against a blocky beast of a building. Especially when it’s a record holder, in this case the largest elephant-shaped structure in the world. This record was once held by Lucy the Elephant, a six-story elephant built in 1882 in Margate City, New Jersey. And while the Elephant Building is nowhere near as realistic as Lucy, it’s certainly much, much bigger.","The Elephant Building is located in the Chatuchak District in the northern part of Bangkok, Thailand. It can be seen from various parts of the city, but some of the best views are had from along the Vibhavadi Rangsit Expressway when coming into Bangkok from Suvarnabhumi Airport."
59,Wat Tham Ta Pan,"Tambon Tham Nam Phut, Thailand",Grotesque statues of figures from Buddhist hell haunt the temple's Sin Park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-tham-ta-pan,"A small sculpture garden full of figures from Buddhist hell (Naraka) greets visitors who wander through Wat Tham Ta Pan. It’s a sinister sight, one filled with gory images of tortured beings and terrifying beasts. Wat Tham Ta Pan is a “heaven and hell” temple. At first glance, it seems like a fairly neglected site full of the usual animals, and deities. There are pleasant, peaceful scenes designed to represent heaven, but the Sin Park is what you’ll likely remember the most. It’s smaller than other hell temples found within Thailand, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less impressive—or disturbing. You begin the journey through heaven and hell by walking through the mouth of a massive dragon. You continue winding through the belly of the beast, down a dark, damp tunnel lit only by wisps of light that flit through the few windows. After passing through a cave meant to represent heaven, you’ll emerge at the entrance to hell. Once there, you’ll be greeted by maimed, tortured statues. Many of them are complete with vivid red touch-up paint to highlight their fresh wounds. Some are being speared or strangled, others are forced to climb up spiked trees. Some show hellish beasts as well. The gruesome scenes depict the eternal future that awaits sinners who fail to follow the Five Moral Precepts of Buddhism. It’s presumably designed to put the faithful on the path to good behavior by terrifying them.","Some of the scenes depicted in the hell section are vivid and gruesome and are probably unfit for children to see. There's easy access by car, with parking out front. But it's probably a bit of a challenge to get to on public transport."
60,Wat Arun,"Khwaeng Wat Arun, Thailand",This dazzling Buddhist temple was constructed from over one million ceramic tiles salvaged from a British shipwreck.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-arun,"Rising like a glittering palace over the western side of the Chao Phraya River, Wat Arun is one of Thailand’s most spectacular and oldest temples. The site is renowned for its colorful, glazed ceramic tiles (reportedly over one million of them) and its ornate central spire (or prang) that currently towers at over 260 feet (about 80 meters). What makes the temple particularly unusual is the origin of its tiles: they were originally broken bits of Chinese dishes that were salvaged from a British shipwreck. The found porcelain pieces were then crafted into ornate flower petals and embedded into the prang to produce a glittering effect under the sun. Named “The Temple of Dawn” during the Ayutthaya Period (1768), King Taksin came across the original site by boat after returning back from battle with the Burmese army. As he approached the city at sunrise, the king named the glittering spectacle after the Hindu god Aruna (who is the charioteer of the Sun god Surya). Later, King Rama III added the elaborate ceramic tiles, tiny seashells, Buddha statues, as well as its signature central pagoda spire. Despite its name, the full scope of Wat Arun is perhaps best appreciated at sunset from the river. While visitors can see temple’s design touches in detail by day (including several Buddha statues and four other spires), it’s particularly beautiful when lit up to a radiant, glowing silhouette at night. If you do, however, visit during the day, it’s best to arrive right when the gates open at 8:30am or late afternoon just before sunset. “Wat Arun’s full official name is Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan – but you’re never going to remember that, let alone pronounce it!,” Pintida Harnpanpongse of Tourism Authority of Thailand tells Atlas Obscura. “It’s considered as one of the most iconic, most recognizable, and most beautiful temples in Thailand because of its unique design, fine craftsmanship, colorful decorated spires, and its majestic riverside location that stands right across from Wat Pho (the Temple of Reclining Buddha).” The central tower (prang) is said to symbolize Mount Meru—the home of the gods in Hindu cosmology and the center of the physical and spiritual universe—with its grand tiered design that resembles a stairway to heaven. “Surrounding the Prang there are three rows of statues: on the bottom row there are demons representing hell, the middle row [depicts] monkeys and represent the earth, and the top row are angels representing heaven,” says tour guide Thippy Thepthewi. “The Prang was built with similarity to Khmer architecture, but actually it is our Thai Rattanakosin style, since its slimmer and taller with indentions in the corner (which differ from the Khmer style).” Wat Arun has also recently underwent an extensive three-year renovation to restore the Chinese porcelain tiles and seashells, as well as the base of the pagoda.",Wat Arun is open to the public daily between 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Entry is 50 THT for adults.

This peculiar structure is actually home to a five-story museum featuring information on both traditional Thai folklore and animal biology. Expect to see life-size replicas of the different species of toad while reading about Thai mythology and superstitions. Once you reach the top of the attraction, you’ll find yourself standing on a viewing platform in the toad’s mouth. This is the perfect time to gaze out upon the Chi river and take in the fresh views. If you’re wondering why a giant toad is this park’s main attraction, it all goes back a Thai belief. Phraya Khan Khak translates to “the Toad King,” a noble amphibian spirit whose presence is linked to rainfall. To pay their respects to this spirit, the Isan region of Thailand holds a yearly rocket festival in mid-July, coinciding with the pre-farming season. Niter-and-charcoal-filled rockets are fired into the air, asking the holy spirit to let the rain pour down from the heavens and ensure a bountiful harvest. So, next time you see a toad hop across your path, it may be forecasting the beginning of a storm! The giant toad is not the only attraction to check out. Be sure to grab a photo among the statues of dancing Isan women and relax in the quaint gardens nearby. Or, you could visit their other museum, which, this time, is inside a huge building shaped into a roaring, serpent-like creature.","Take a plane from Bangkok to the Ubon Ratchathani district, then you can get a bus or taxi ride to Yasothon town."
62,Erawan Shrine,"Bangkok, Thailand",A shrine built to combat the bad karma of a commercial venture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erawan-shrine,"At the advice of a respected astrologer, the Erawan Shrine was built in 1956 around the same time as the construction of a nearby hotel to eliminate the bad karma believed to be caused by laying the foundations on an inauspicious date. Unhappy spirits were believed to be responsible for delaying the hotel’s construction by injuring the laborers and causing the loss of a shipment of Italian marble intended for the building. To add to the cacophony of angry ghosts swarming around the Ratchaprasong intersection, the government had historically executed criminals in the same place. A Hindu shrine was seen as a solution, and the hotel plans were modified to accommodate the devotional site. The shrine is named for Erawan, the Thai name for the white elephant who carries a Hindu god, but the focus of the site is the golden statue of the four-faced Brahma, Phra Phrom. Unfortunately, it wasn’t all peaceful good times at the shrine from then on. In 2006, a man later judged to be mentally unstable attacked the Brahma with a hammer. He was subsequently beaten to death by an angry mob. In 2015, a bomb at the shrine killed 20 and injured 125. It is suspected to have been planted by Turkish nationalists in response to the deportation of Turkish prisoners. Since then the statue and the shrine have been restored. You can see local Thais making merit to the statue with garlands, incense, candles, and even birds, and see a troupe of Thai classical dancers in costume.",

Handcrafted by local villagers in the Mae Hong Son province, Boon Ko Ku So Bridge stretches over lush rice paddies and makes for one of the most picturesque mountain views in the region. With its opulent forest scenery with lush vegetation, Boon Ko Ku So Bridge is not only Insta-worthy, but it’s perfect for a meditative nature walk. The pliable bamboo bridge has a lively buoyancy to it as you walk along the handmade, 800-meter stretch. If you arrive before 8 a.m., you can also catch a glimpse of the early morning alms giving from local villagers to the Buddhist monks. When the villagers give alms to the monks, they bring a variety of small dishes, including individual portions of spicy chicken curry and vegetables, white rice, and a local dessert all wrapped and steamed inside the sacred pandan leaf. In the early morning hours, the area isn’t tourist-heavy, so you’re sure to get some nature time for yourself and find your own zen, too. There’s a small temple on the bridge, as well as a flower swing for a photo opp with a backdrop of the mountains. There’s also a coffee shop right on the bridge, which artfully prepares its locally sourced beans.","This raised walkway is best to visit during the rainy season in Northern Thailand, which runs from June through October. If you go during the off-season, the rice fields will have already been harvested or dried up. While you’re there, be sure to check out the Pam Bok waterfall and swimming hole. It’s important to dress modestly out of respect for both the villagers and the monks when visiting the bridge. And if you happen to come on an alms giving day/time, remember that it’s considered impolite for women to directly touch Buddhist monks. The temple is only open for visitors on Buddhist holidays, but there are a few straw alcoves on the bridge for your own meditative practice in nature."

Sea water is pumped into the fields and is allowed to gradually evaporate during the dry season between January and April. When the water disappears and leaves behind dazzling white crystals, laborers step in. The work is backbreaking and labor-intensive. Women are typically engaged in scooping the salt into baskets.

The Lang River (Nam Lang) runs through the entire length of the cave, from one side of the mountain to the other, and the only way to explore the long cavern is to hire a rickety bamboo raft and a local guide with a gas lantern. Upon arriving at the entrance of the cave, it is obvious that you are not the first visitor to get here, but once you get inside the cave, the utter lack of artificial lights and permanent facilities adds a certain sense of adventure. In no time, stalactites and stalagmites put up a show that took millions of years to form. At different points of the trip, depending on the time of the year, guides stop to let visitors step on the muddy ground and slippery bamboo passageways to get a closer look at the rock formations, which can exceed 65 feet in height. As the end of the trip approaches a shaft of light cuts through the darkness, and the emerald green of the vegetation outside can be blinding. The opening at the end of the cave is huge and thousands of birds dart in all directions.  The chirping can be deafening, but it is an impressive sight. The Lawa people used to bury their dead inside caves, and at one point 1,400-year-old coffins were found inside Tham Lod. You won’t be able to see the coffins upon visiting, but archaeological excavations in the area have proved that Tham Lod was used as a burial place by the Hoabinhian people between 5,500 and 9,000 BC.","Tham Lod is about 31 miles northwest of Pai, where accommodation is widely available.

There are, however, a whole bunch of erotic statues to keep you occupied. Inland from the lovely beaches that generally attract visitors to the island is the strange art garden known as The Kingdom of Somchai’s Affection. The naked, and often suggestively posed figures in the garden are the work of local artist Khun Somchai who created the sexualized figures long before the tourists came to the island. Exaggerated breasts and female genitalia are on full display in the garden, abstracted by the stone forms, but nonetheless sexualized. Many of the figures are configured as tables or strange fountains, but this generally serves to make the figures seem even more submissive. The naked art figures are found in a patch of woods down a stone path, the overgrowth obscuring some of the more lurid works in the collection from innocent passersby. Somchai’s old wooden house can also be found in the garden.",On the end of the island down by Koh Mak Resort. There are sculptures of ladies pointing to the path in the woods.

There, strange statues show—with shockingly gruesome detail—the many ways to torture a human soul. The statues all stand within the Hell Garden at Wat Sa Kamphaeng Yai, a fairly modern Buddhist temple situated within a much older complex. They’re meant to warn sinners of the unspeakable horrors awaiting their souls in Naraka, Buddhist Hell. Though small in size, the Wat Sa Kamphaeng Yai Hell Garden is still no easy sight to take in. The strange, twisted statues are all subjected to a whole assortment of gory, graphic injuries and abnormalities. A man weighed down by his oversized penis is the veritable cherry on top of the cake in this smorgasbord of vomit, defecation, and general human suffering. There are similar gardens throughout Thailand, all of which offer visitors the same horrifying experience, usually while leading to a more peaceful place within the site. In each one, the punishment typically mirrors the crime. Thankfully, Wat Sa Kamphaeng Yai also offers a serene respite from the hellish horrors.

Here, every available surface is drenched in gold and bedecked with ornate mirrored tiles the color of precious jewels. A wide skirt of steps flanked by two sinuous emerald dragons leads straight to the towering central figure: a 12-meter-tall golden Buddha. It sits atop a hill overlooking the stunning aquamarine waters surrounding the tiny islet of Koh Faan. Sitting in Mara pose, this Buddha represents a state of enlightenment, purity and calm. Reflecting these principles, a ring of large bronze prayer bells encircles the Buddha, gently swaying in the cool ocean breeze. Use one of the provided wooden strikers to lightly ring each bell for good luck as you take in the glorious views. In the early mornings, one can observe monks chanting their morning prayers as well as locals who bring offerings of food, incense and flowers. Be sure to pop into a few of the stalls surrounding the base of the temple during your visit. Local street food, fruit, flowers and fun souvenirs can be found aplenty. Neaby Chaweng Beach, Wat Plai Lem and Ang Thong National Marine Park are popular stops to check out during your visit as well.","It is requested that visitors respect the sanctity of the space by wearing modest clothing (trousers or long shorts and tops that cover the shoulders), removing shoes before entering the complex and being courteous of local devotees. The temple can be reached via a causeway from the main island of Koh Samui. From the airport, head north on route 4171. Take the second right and the first left, then follow until the road ends."

Just like many things Thai these telephone booths are colorful, yet they are also decaying relics of the past, wasting away in a vacant lot. However, they are a joy to look at and indulge as they are scattered around the lot. The phone booth graveyard has become a popular haunt for graffiti artists, so keep an eye open for several hidden messages from local artists.",Rent a scooter in Prachuap Khiri Khan and head towards Klong Wan Beach.
70,Robot Building,"Bangkok, Thailand",The bank's whimsical shape was inspired by a child’s toy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/robot-building,"In the late-1970s, the Thai architect Sumet Jumsai was approached by the Bank of Asia. The bank was looking for a design for its new headquarters in Bangkok, something that would reflect the computerization of banking. For a long while, Sumet struggled to come up with a suitable design. But then his son walked into his study carrying a toy robot, and inspiration struck. Banking and fun don’t generally mix. In Thailand, however, fun has been elevated to a way of life, a revered ethos known as sanuk. Perhaps for this reason the Bank of Asia was so delighted by Sumet’s proposal, and eagerly began construction of the Robot Building. Completed in 1987 at a cost of US$10 million, the 20-story building was initially the tallest building in the major commercial district of Sathorn. And while it no longer dominates the skyline, it remains one of the most recognizable towers in the city. The floors of the building decrease in area at regular intervals, creating the “body” of the robot. Two round windows on the top section (the head) resemble lidded eyeballs, giving the robot a cartoon-like—and slightly sleepy—appearance. To complete the effect, Sumet added antennas on the roof, which serve as both communication masts and lightning rods, while the sides of the building are adorned with large metallic-looking nuts, the largest measuring 12.5 feet in diameter (You can see a 3D model of the structure here). The building was later selected by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles as one of the 50 seminal buildings of the century. It has its detractors, of course, but then who doesn’t? And for many people, especially those not overcome by cynicism, the idea of having a giant toy robot standing in the middle of a city is just plain fun. Even if it does contain a whole bunch of bankers.","The Robot Building is located at 191 South Sathorn Road in the Sathorn District of Bangkok. It is currently occupied by the United Overseas Bank (which acquired Bank of Asia in 2005) and serves as their Bangkok headquarters. You can get there by taking the BTS Skytain to Chong Nonsi, which is a short walk from the building. You can also see it while traveling on the Skytrain. You’ll see it on your left just after leaving Chong Nonsi station if you’re on the Silom Line heading to Saphan Taksin, or on your right after leaving Surasak station from Saphan Taksin heading towards Siam or National Stadium."
71,House of Opium,"Wiang, Thailand",A small museum in the Golden Triangle tells the story of the opium drug trade that gripped Northern Thailand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-opium,"The House of Opium, in the town of Sop Ruak in the Chiang Rai province of Northern Thailand, is everything you ever wanted to know about opium but never dared ask. This small museum is located right on the Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia, the area where Thai, Lao and Myanmar borders converge. The region is known for being one of the world’s two largest producers of opium, along with Afghanistan in the Golden Crescent. The museum was founded by Patcharee Srimatyakul in 1990. Born in the area, Patcharee had a passion for collecting opium paraphernalia and memorabilia. When she noticed that opium items were becoming extremely hard to find — with Thailand cracking down on the illegal drug trade — she turned the collection into a museum open to the public. The exhibits display tools and objects used to plant, harvest and trade opium, including pipes, scales, weights, knives, scrapers. It also includes some lovely poppy flowers, the source of opium production. The bulk of the opium cultivation was done by hill tribes in the Golden Triangle, as the drug trade offered a good source of income for farmers otherwise living it poverty. Alongside the objects in collection, the museum provides interesting information and old photographs related to the production and consumption of opium, and the drug’s impact on the lives of the hill tribe people.","There are two museums located in the Golden Triangle area related to opium. The larger, up in the hills, is called Hall of Opium. The House of Opium is located in town, along the Mekong River. It's open daily from 7am-6pm. Admission fee is Baht 50."
72,Phu Chi Fah,"Po, Thailand","This mountain sunrise is one of the most breathtaking views in Thailand, yet well off the tourist trail.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phu-chi-fah,"Phu Chi Fah is a must for anyone seeking the perfect sunrise experience. Located on the Thai/Lao border, this mountainous area is several degrees removed from the mass tourism Thailand is known for. It is quite far (almost 60 miles) from the nearest city, Chiang Rai, and there are hardly any other sights in the vicinity. And let’s not forget that in order to get to the peak before dawn, you need to wind up and down rural roads in the dark. Yet, it is well worth it. Once you’ve reached Phu Chi Fah before the sun rises, darkness begins lifting, and most days a thin layer of mist appears from the lowlands, forming a bed of fluff through which the higher hilltops peek through. This is the signature view of the Phu Chi Fah sunrise. Once the mist begins lifting, the view opens up, revealing forests, hills, valleys, farmland and the mighty Mekong River all the way to Laos and beyond. And above it all, colorful hues and shades turn the sky into an ever-changing work of abstract art. The beauty of the Phu Chi Fah sunrise appears in many tourist brochures and posters, but its name is rarely mentioned, which also goes to explain why so few visitors make it here—that is international visitors, as Thai locals are very fond of this place. The Phu Chi Fah viewpoint is the top of a steadily rising mountain that terminates abruptly with a dramatic drop. The most photogenic spot is just before you arrive at the top, so that both the cliff and the misty blanket are in sight.","Phu Chi Fah can be visited by staying at one of the hotels along the way there from Chiang Rai. Get acquainted with the rural roads the previous day so that reaching Phu Chi Fah in the dark is not as daunting. It can also be visited as a one-day trip from Chiang Rai, but that means setting off by 3 a.m. and navigating roads you’ve never been on. Either option requires your own means of transport. Phu Chi Fah can also be reached via public transport, but it is probably a 3-day trip, with the problem of getting to the top before sunrise—possible but difficult. The last 13 km to Phu Chi Fah are on Road 1093, which branches off from Road 1155 in an easterly direction. Road signs are not clear, so you may have to ask around. From the parking lot, which is also the end of the road, it’s an easy 15-minute hike (if you’re reasonably fit) to the viewpoint. Visit Phu Chi Fah on a weekday for a chance to have the place all for yourself."
73,Chit Beer,"Koh Kret, Thailand","On a river island north of Bangkok, a small bar helped lead a home-brewing rebellion.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chit-beer,"To shelter two giant beer companies from competition, the 1950 Liquor Act made it effectively illegal to home-brew beer in Thailand. As such, most Thai craft breweries have been forced to manufacture abroad and import their beer back into the country, suffering heavy taxes to sell their product. On a tiny river island north of the country’s capital, however, one man has led a home-brewing rebellion, not only making his own beer for sale, but also training a new generation of Thai home-brewers. Amidst the sea of pallid, bland-tasting lagers that dominate the Thai beerscape, Chit Beer offers a flavor oasis. With a rotating menu of home-brewed IPAs, wheats, sours, and porters galore, there’s something for every beer-lover at this riverside, open-air bar—especially for those with a proclivity for subversion. For years, founder and brewer Wichit “Chit” Saiklao has run this rogue brewery and kitchen like an open secret. While the island of Koh Kret, 15 miles up the Chao Phraya River from Bangkok, is not the easiest to reach, those who venture there can find Chit Beers on tap as well as brewing classes (which are open by reservation, but usually booked out months in advance). While this means he has armed thousands of rebellious beer enthusiasts with the knowledge needed to subvert a corrupt Thai law, it also means he’s paid his fair share of fines to police. The brewery has enabled a supportive feedback loop whereby students of Chit’s tutelage who start their own micro-breweries are featured on draught at Chit Beer, giving young brewers the exposure and capital needed to grow their small, clandestine businesses. A former Thai army colonel who runs two IT companies and occasionally teaches electrical engineering at the Thai Royal Academy, “Chit” (pronounced “Sheet”) is a man of order with respect for the law. His bar and home-brewing school, however, have been a stand for common sense. The army man knows when an army is needed: As he told Draft in 2016, “We must create an army of home brewers. We will win when we have something unique … and it touches the tongue of someone in power.” One of his beers must’ve touched the right tongue: In 2018, Chit was granted a license to open the country’s first legal Thai craft brewery, Mitr Craft, and Mitr Bar, an outlet where he can legally sell his beer. The latter is located in Bangkok’s Victory Monument neighborhood. For those who want the original outlaw experience on the river island, however, he still maintains Chit Beer on Koh Kret.",
74,Death Railway Bridge,"Ban Tai, Thailand",This bridge made famous in a novel and on-screen wasn't actually built over the river Kwai.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/death-railway-bridge-the-bridge-over-the-river-kwai,"There is a famous bridge in Thailand that crosses a river called the Khwae. It’s a destination for visitors of all kinds, including Europeans and Americans—who mostly have no idea they’ve been mispronouncing it for over 60 years. The river under the famous crossing is known to most westerners as the “Kwai,” thanks to the 1952 novel and 1957 movie version of The Bridge Over the River Kwai. The specific plot and characters are a fiction, but the underlying story is true, and the 500-foot span has become Thailand’s most visible and poignant remnant of a brutal chapter of World War II. The bridge is in the quiet, provincial town of Kanchanaburi, about 30 miles east of the Myanmar border. It was constructed during the War as part of the Thailand-Burma Railway, a transport system that came to be known as the “Death Railway,” its dark history bloodied by the nearly 100 thousand forced laborers and 16,000 prisoners of war who lost their lives during its construction. The historic bridge is a symbolic reminder of the harrowing cruelty suffered by the Allied POWs (some American, the majority English and Dutch) and the conscripted Southeast Asian laborers, all forced into service by the Japanese. The intent was to build a 250-mile railway as a supply route from Ban Pong in Thailand to Thanbyuzayat in Burma (now Myanmar). A project estimated to take up to five years was forced to completion in 16 months, and with it came unrelenting brutality, rampant disease, squalid conditions and workers’ rations barely above starvation. The bridge served its intended purpose for less than two years, when the railway was heavily bombed by the Allied forces in 1945. What was intended as a line to supply Japan and its plans to conquer further west, instead becoming an escape route for retreating Japanese troops. Control of the railway was divided between the British, who took the Burmese side, and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), who took the Thai side and what remained of the bridge. Although the stories of the novel and movie were inventions of Pierre Boulle and Hollywood, the bridge itself was an important part of the railway—it just didn’t happen to cross the Kwai (or Khwae, which is pronounced more like “kware”). There was no bridge over the Khwae—Boulle simply got his rivers mixed up. It’s the right bridge, but the river is the Mae Klong. So rather than change minds over the mistake, the government of Thailand simply changed the name of the river in 1960, rechristening this stretch as the Khwae Yai. The Bridge over the River Khwae Yai suffered heavy damage in the bombing, taking out all but the outer steel structure. It was rebuilt by the SRT, and has since been used for commercial and tourist travel. You can cross by rail car, or see this piece of history up-close on foot.","Kanchanaburi is about 75 miles northwest of Bangkok, and there are bus routes from Northern and Southern terminals (Mo Chit and Sai Tai Mai), and from Victory Monument. There are also busses from the nearby towns of Ratchaburi and Suphanburi. Travel by train is on the Bangkok Noi - Nam Tok line, and there are also packaged day trips from Bangkok to the Bridge and surrounding memorials and other World War II sites (e.g., the Allied War Cemetery, the Thailand-Burma Railway Centre Museum, and the JEATH War Museum). In the last week of November and the first week of December, sound and light shows commemorate the Allied forces attack on the Death Railway, and big crowds descend – so at this time in particular, plan your trip well in advance and book ahead to secure travel and accommodations. For the fictionalized version, the 1952 novel by Pierre Boulle is still in print, or you can check out the 1957 movie with William Holden and Alec Guinness."
75,Wat Mahabut,"Bangkok, Thailand",A shrine honoring a legendary ghost bride lies within this vibrant temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-mahabut,"This enormous temple has, at its heart, a captivating ghost story. Amid its colorful displays is a shrine dedicated to a legendary dead bride. According to the story, Mae Nak Phra Khanong was a beautiful woman with a deep, undying love for her husband, Mak. Mak was sent to war while Mae Nak was pregnant, not knowing he would never see his love again—at least, while she was still alive. Mae Nak and her unborn child perished during birth. But her husband did not realize what had happened after he returned from the war, as both his wife and child were still there waiting for him. Neighbors tried to warn him it was really their ghosts still lingering within the home, but Mae Nak ensured their attempts were thwarted. However, Mak eventually realized he’d been living among the ghosts of his dead family. He fled to Wat Mahabut, where the spirit of his lost lover could not reach him. Mae Nak terrorized the town in her anger and grief before being captured by an exorcist and contained in a jar. She eventually escaped but was again captured. Today, a shrine within the temple honors this storied ghost bride and her tragic tale. People seeking refuge from the bustle of Bangkok’s streets come to leave offerings at the shrine, as well as to release fish and turtles into the river.","From On Nut BTS Station, walk north, take right onto On Nut road and walk another 10 minutes to Wat, just past Lumpini condos."
76,White Buddha Temple,"Pai District, Thailand",A meditative walk up 353 stairs leads to a majestic white Buddha overlooking Pai.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/white-buddha-temple,"With its villas and rice paddies, yoga studios and organic eats, the mountain city of Pai is a bohemian backpacker’s dream. Located roughly three to four hours from Chiang Mai by bus or car, Pai is known for its spiritual sites, including the White Buddha Temple. Perched high up on the mountainside in the Mae Hong Son Province, you can catch a glimpse of the elegant white statue from all around the city of Pai. Getting to the top, however, requires a bit of effort—353 steps, to be exact. In the rainy season, the walk up isn’t that bad—even if you’re not all that athletic. The key is to pace yourself as you ascend the stairs, especially under the hot sun at midday or when the humidity is high. Bring extra water along for the journey, just in case you get dizzy when you reach the top. You can buy beverages beforehand from a vendor at the base of the stairs. Once you’re at the top, you can catch lush views of the surrounding mountains and rice paddies, as well as a breathtaking sunset just behind the mountains. The White Buddha faces west, so you simply have to look back to see it. It’s also a particularly peaceful place at sunrise. Visitors can light candles in front of the White Buddha and meditate anywhere on the large tiled platform that surrounds its base.","Be aware that the temple enforces a very strict dress code: both men and women should not wear tank tops, revealing clothing, or shorts/dresses that go above the knee. If you already happen to be wearing a tank top (or something similar) for the day, just bring a sarong, wrap, or scarf with you to cover up as you ascend and descend the stairs. There’s no entry fee and the temple is open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. everyday. At the very bottom of the road that leads to the temple stairs is a must-try fresh, organic lunch spot called Earth Tone vegetarian cafe. There’s also a health shop/general store stocked with handcrafted tinctures, oils, and artisanal beauty products located inside the restaurant."

The park was built in 1986 to attract more tourists to this remote part of Thailand. Most of the models are on a scale of 1:25, and the park is split into two main sections: Mini Europe and Mini Siam. Before entering Mini Siam, visitors cross the Mini Europe garden, although perhaps it would be better named Mini World. This portion of the park contains models from many places outside of Thailand - Buckingham Palace, the Statue of Liberty, Abusimbel in Egypt, the Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and the Sydney Opera House. Mini Siam celebrates Thailand’s many religious and historical sites, such as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the Bridge over the River Kwai.

78,Wat Phumin,"Pha Sing, Thailand","Riding on a pair of architectural dragons, this Thailand temple holds murals full of lurid imagery.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phumin,"Many visitors to Thailand have noted a certain amount of “temple fatigue”, visiting so many temples that at the end they all look the same and one can quickly lose interest in even the most intriguing among them. However the historic Wat Phumin Temple easily separates itself from the pack with its strange, NSFW murals of demons and domestics. Built in 1596, Wat Phumin is a uniquely designed temple meant to evoke the feeling that it is riding aloft on the backs of two huge serpents called “nagas.” Also unique to the temple are the four entrances which are aligned with the cardinal directions and are each attended by a Buddha statue inside of the temple. While the temple was established in the 16th century, the current exterior of the building actually dates back to the 1800s, as do the site’s treasured murals. On the inside of the building, covering nearly every wall are elaborate murals that were put in place during the temple’s 1800s restoration. The subjects of the murals are split between tales from the lives of the Buddha and simpler domestic representations, outlying life in the area during the 19th century. Among the historic paintings however are a number of shockingly graphic depictions of sexual misconduct and genital horror making the peacefulness of the site a bit circumspect. Regardless of the slightly lurid imagery, the Wat Phumin Temple is still a site to behold, and at very least it will definitely help raise an eye even among travelers who have seen enough temples for a lifetime.",

However, the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 had other plans. When it made landfall, the entire region was forced to evacuate. After recovery efforts, the project was abandoned amidst disagreements between developers and the local government. The complex consists of several buildings built on top of a parking complex. The remains of a pool, guest rooms, conference rooms, and dining halls are all visible. The buildings are fascinating (and a bit frightening) to explore as they are desolate and incomplete. There are plenty of hazards such as half-finished staircases and random holes in the ground, so explore cautiously. The views from the top floors are spectacular.","Advice on entry: You can enter from the beach by scrambling up through the bottom floors of the parking garage, but it's not advised. There is a road that leads right up to the entrance on the top floors. Make sure you take several strong light sources if you plan on exploring the parking garage. Even in broad daylight, it's extremely dark and big holes litter the floor and are often filled with water. It's not wise to explore here alone. Wear appropriate clothing, between the rusty rebar and broken walls there are plenty of times you will want to be protected. There's a road that leads right to where the front door would be if it had been completed. There are no signs, ropes or anything indicating the property is off limits.

Look around the center of the intersection, and you’ll easily spot striking sculptures standing atop the lights. Drivers (and pedestrians) will notice eagles, an elephant, and an otter; all animals that are considered sacred. You’ll also see something that from a distance resembles a primate. But look closer, and you’ll notice these ape-like fixtures are actually cavemen, carrying “suitcases” that contain the light boxes. The prehistoric men are meant to be an ode to the town’s ancient ancestors. Archaeologists have found pottery, stone tools, and rock art within the region’s caves and cliffs. The remains of prehistoric people that date back to about 30,000 years ago were also found in the region, and these sculptures celebrate the discoveries of those long-lost human relatives.","Krabi is a beautiful, little city to spend a day or two.

According to legend, Phra Nang was an Indian princess who was killed in a shipwreck. In another tale, Phra Nang was the wife of a fisherman who was lost at sea. She lived out the rest of her days in the cave, awaiting her husband’s return. Today, local fisherman and boatmen leave offerings in Phra Nang cave to ensure safe travel on the sea. These offers take the form of male genitalia - the cave is covered in many “linga”, or phallic-shaped statues meant to represent the Hindu god Shiva. The offerings in Phra Nang cave are especially realistic - the penises have discernible ridges and heads. They are decorated with colorful cloth, and the cave is filled with incense.",A boat is necessary to reach Phra Nang Beach.

There, a gargantuan chicken head rises from the turquoise depths. The great stone chicken watches over flocks of island hopping tourists like a mother hen would guard her chicks. Rather than feathers, it sports a coat of lush greenery. And though the rock’s resemblance to the head of a chicken with a mountainous hump behind it is the obvious attraction, so much more beauty lies beyond the odd poultry spectacle. Chicken Island is intriguing not only for many of the typical island reasons, but also for its slightly daring unpredictability. It’s an uninhabited and nearly pristine white sand beach that remains undeveloped, save for one little snack shack. Chicken Island deserves its own day of meandering. The beach is serene and peaceful. A visit at low tide will allow you to walk across a land bridge that appears seemingly out of nowhere and leads you to Tup Island, a smaller, sunnier island whose beach floods during high tide. The snorkeling here is some of the best in the area, with a wide variety of underwater life floating right past your mask. Sure, you’ll come across tour boats stopping for an hour so tourists can snap a picture of the quirky rock formation and snorkel the coral reef, but the area is largely untouched because of just how many other islands there are to explore.","It's about 30 minutes by boat from the west coast of Krabi. You can charter a boat from tourist services in Krabi. You can also take a boat from Ao Phra Nang Beach. Beware a rising tide or a violent ocean during off season.

In fact, an elephant entrapment ceremony commenced within the kraal, and was attended by the kings of the era. This kraal is the only one left in Thailand. Elephants were once an invaluable commodity used for war, transportation service, and product export to India and Persia. Elephants from wild herds were captured by men riding tame elephants who used bamboo poles with leather nooses to ensnare the giant beasts. The captured elephants were herded into the kraal through a funnel in the back wall, and were separated for either domestic use or for exporting. The last round-up of wild elephants in Thailand was in 1903. The kraal is surrounded by a wooden gate with pillars that are easily moved as needed. Inside the gate is a huge brick wall enclosing large wooden pillars driven deep into the ground to log in the elephants.

Tham Tu Pu definitely belongs to the latter. Set in the countless shades of green in the farmland around Chiang Rai is an elegant sculpture of Buddha that looks as if it were rising from the thick vegetation at its base. This dusty white figure of the Buddha stands out against a limestone formation, making it easy to spot. The site consists of a rundown building housing the only monk on site (and his cats), a small temple, a set of intriguing statues, a dingy cave, and the large image of the Buddha that looms over the compound. A set of steep steps cuts through the limestone cliff and leads to the cave, within which is a small table with a statue of Buddha mounted on top. The statues by the temple depict monks praying with their hands covering their faces.","Although it is no more than about half a mile (two kilometers) from the center of Chiang Rai by crow’s flight, all the possible routes wind and intersect through farmland, adding a good mile or so (about four kilometers) to the distance, which makes for a great bike or motorbike outing.

87,Democracy Monument,"Bangkok, Thailand",Bangkok celebrated its shifting monarchy with a militaristic homage to democracy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/democracy-monument,"In the center of Bangkok, Thailand, a rather beautiful monument tells a rather misleading story about the Siamese Revolution of 1932. There is no mistaking the Democracy Monument in Bangkok, with four wing-like structures extending 24 meters skyward surrounding a central monument featuring a stone-etched constitution. All of this is located at the center of a busy vehicular intersection making the site difficult to miss. Reliefs at the base of each wing show pro-military propaganda images, portraying Thai soldiers as protectors of the people and champions of an adoring democracy. Erected in 1939, the monument was meant to support the military regime which had taken control of the country during a coup d’état in 1932. While the soldiers on the monument are pictured doing battle for a prosperous Westernized future, the Siamese Revolution occurred without any bloodshed, taking place while the reigning monarch at the time, King Prajadhipok, was on holiday. Eventually the king was exiled and simply abdicated the throne. While the Democracy Monument may be pretty on-the-nose about its support of a militarily-established government, the landmark has been the site of several protests against later military regimes in 1973 and 1992. No matter the political baggage associated with the site, it remains an impressive work of regal, golden sculpture work, which is an aesthetic truth that would surely win any poll.",Occupies the traffic circle at the intersection of Ratchadamnoen Klang Road and Dinso Road
88,Solar Chicken,"Tambon Chong Sakae, Thailand","In Phetchaburi, Thailand, a roadside vendor cooks his fare with 1,000 mirrors and the power of the sun.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/solar-chicken-thailand,"In Phetchaburi, about two and a half hours south of Bangkok, roadside vendor Sila Sutharat offers chicken with a side of solar power in a grand, visual display. Using a curved wall of nearly 1,000 moveable mirrors, he concentrates sunshine onto a row of marinated chickens. Under the beams, sizzling a bird to perfection takes 12 minutes. The wall of mirrors saves money, pollutes less, puts on a good show, and—according to the inventor-chef—makes for more tender, evenly-cooked chicken. But beyond praise and patrons, the innovator’s device earned him an honorary science degree from a local university. On being asked about the distinction in an interview with Ozy, Sutharat replied with a smile, “I was so very proud, because I barely even finished fourth grade.” Sutharat designed and constructed the massive panels himself, after feeling the sun’s heat reflected onto him from a passing bus. Although he usually barbecued his gai yang, a popular Thai chicken dish, on a traditional charcoal grill, he decided to try harnessing the sun’s energy instead. At the time, fuel sources such as gas and petroleum had also become increasingly expensive, and wood suppliers were experiencing shortages. Over the last two decades, Sutharat has maintained his solar grill business by cooking for a mostly-local customer base. People from Thailand and farther afield only began flocking to his operation after videos of his apparatus in action went viral online. He now offers pork trotters, in addition to poultry.",

The temple was hidden underwater for 20 years after the construction of the nearby Pa Sak Cholasit Dam. But its remains have returned to the surface due to an extreme, decade-long drought in central Thailand. Crumbling pillars supporting nothing, stone steps leading nowhere, a 13-foot headless Buddha statue, and other scattered ruins that were completely submerged during the rainy season can now be seen in full. (Check out this video to see some drone footage of the resurfaced temple.) The reservoir is down to just 4 percent of its normal water levels, and though the local people are well aware of the serious impact of the drought, the risen temple is seen as a place of good fortune. Lottery tickets are sold at the entrance, fish and birds can be purchased for merit-release, and entrepreneurs have opened shops to sell the usual snacks and drinks. The irony of this newfound visitor attraction isn’t lost on everyone, especially the local fishermen and farmers who have watched their means of earning a living recede with the water. According to Reuters, the dam originally helped irrigate 1.3 million acres of farmland. That’s now down to just 3,000 acres after the long drought.",The temple has gained a lot of local attention and these days is commonly packed with visitors.
90,Elephant Poo Poo Paper Park,"Tambon Mae Raem, Thailand",You'll never meet anyone this passionate about elephant droppings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-poo-poo-paper-park,"Chiang Mai’s Elephant Poo Poo Park brings a whole new meaning to eco-tourism. The interactive outdoor museum introduces visitors to the process of making paper from a rather unconventional source: elephant poo. Making paper from elephant poop is a sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to traditional tree-based products. By not using trees, it helps reduce deforestation and makes sure the abundance of animal waste isn’t wasted. The paper is entirely sanitary and stink-free. The process of transforming elephant poop into everyday paper is actually pretty straightforward. Once workers have scooped the poop and gathered it, they then wash the waste so that only the plant fibers remain. The fibers are then boiled and sanitized, then mixed with other non-wood pulp fibers. Finally, the intriguing mixture is screened and dried, just like typical wood-based paper has been for thousands of years. Visiting the Elephant Poo Poo Park gives people an up-close encounter with the whole process. You’re even invited to get involved, so be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. The park also has information about traditional paper making, which began in China nearly 2,000 years ago. In addition to the tour, people can check out the cafe and “poo-tique” to pick up souvenirs.","Tickets are 100THB per person, and if you show a songthaew driver the Thai address, they'll get you there no problem. Tours are available in English, Thai, and Chinese. It's probably a good idea to book ahead of time on their website."

Surrounded by the towering Himalayas, the hotel, which is situated on eight acres of land, bills itself as “standing on the roof of the world.” The resort’s 162 guest rooms, villas, and suites - each with either mountain views or a view of the Potala Palace, the museum that formerly housed the Dalai Lama until 1959 - feature high speed Internet access, 24-hour butler service, Bose sound systems, large marble bathrooms, 42-inch plasma televisions, and more. But it’s the swimming pool that really puts this five-star hotel over the top. Described as “the world’s most blinging pool” by the Daily Mail, the pool at the St. Regis Lhasa Resort is plated in gold. “Not content with views of the Himalayas and Tibet’s first ever fine-dining restaurant, the hotel decided luxury wasn’t luxury until its spa looked like something P. Diddy would love to hang around his neck,” the Daily Mail wrote. “And so the swimming pool was lined with thousands of golden tiles.”",
92,Rongbuk Monastery and Guesthouse,"Rikaze Diqu, Tibet",The highest monastery in the world operates a tiny guesthouse with doors open to all.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rongbuk-monastery-and-guesthouse,"At 16,340 feet above sea level, situated near the base of Mount Everest’s north face, nowhere on Earth is it possible to be both physically and spiritually closer to the heavens than at Rongbuk Monastery. Currently home to up to 30 Buddhist monks and nuns in residence, Rongbuk was established in 1909 by Ngawang Tenzin Norbu in its present location. Long known for having meditation huts and caves used by a community of hermetic Buddhist monks and nuns, the monastery is noteworthy for its sprawling grounds containing a main hall with statues of the Buddhist deities Sakyamuni and Padmasambhava, intricate murals, and a prominent chorten containing a reliquary. The first half of the 20th century found Rongbuk booming on religious as well as mountaineering fronts. Once rumored to house 500 devout followers, the monastery gradually expanded to include seven chapels. A modest guesthouse was also added adjacent to the monk and nuns’ quarters for those making briefer spiritual pilgrimages. This addition laid the groundwork for accommodating the ever-increasing number of adventurers drawn to Rongbuk by the tantalizing mountain peaks in its backyard, which continues to this day. Lodging specifications at the monastery’s guesthouse won’t surprise anyone considering it’s being run by reclusive monks at one of the most remote locations in the world. Shared outdoor latrines, tiny rooms, limited heating, and minimal electricity are realities, though most seeking a stay at Rongbuk are doing so for its vantage into the natural and metaphysical, not the tangible.",Accessible by road via a two- to three-hour drive from the Friendship Highway by way of either Shelkar or Old Tingri.
93,Drigung Monastery,"Lhasa, Tibet",This Tibetan monastery has survived multiple attacks and is also a sky burial site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drigung-monastery,"Tibetan monasteries with their peaceful and silent atmospheres might seem unlikely candidates for violence and politics, but the Drigung Thil monastery near Lhasa suffered great destruction early in its history before being rebuilt to become the structure seen today. The fortress-like monastery, also called Drikung, was founded by Kyowa Jigten Sumgon in the late 12th century, and his Drigung Kagyu school of teachings soon acquired a huge following. With its increasing popularity and political power came a rivalry with another influential sect, the Sakyas. The Sakyas eventually led a march on the monastery in 1290 and destroyed it. Though its political clout declined, the monastery was rebuilt and is today an important spiritual center, especially known for its meditation techniques. During the Cultural Revolution, the monastery suffered another series of attacks, with many of its statues and manuscripts looted and buildings damaged. The current site overlooks the Shorong valley and contains traditionally decorated temples, prayer halls, and residences for around 250 monks. The monastery is also well-known for its sky burial site, situated at a height of 14,975 feet on the mountaintop. The death ceremonies are performed by the monks every afternoon, and the following morning the bodies are carried to the lofty site, which is surrounded by small stupas and temples. Himalayan vultures are invited to feed on the flesh, and anything that remains is burnt and offered to the sky in another ritual. It is one of the last remaining places in the world where the traditional excarnation ritual is practiced.",
94,Tanggula Railway Station,"Naqu, Tibet","At 16,627 feet above sea level, this unstaffed station is the highest in the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tanggula-railway-station,"The Tanggula Railway Station sits on the vast Tibetan Plateau, a high-altitude landscape beset by permafrost. But despite its bleak isolation, this lonely, unstaffed railway station has a lofty claim to fame: at 16,627 feet above sea level, it’s the highest railway station in the world. The 1,215-mile-long Qingzang Railway runs from Qinghai to Lhasa, passing through many desolate and barely habitable landscapes. It was an astounding feat of construction, and one that had to overcome numerous problems, particularly on the Golmud to Lhasa section where workers had to contend with both extremely high altitudes and permafrost. Upon its completion, however, the railway was rewarded with a handful of world records. It was recognized as being the highest railway in the world, with the world’s highest railway tunnel (the Fenghuoshan Tunnel) and the world’s highest railway station. The Tanggula Railway Station was inaugurated on July 1, 2006, along with the Golmud to Lhasa section of the Qingzang Railway. The platform stretches for more than half a mile, but the station’s facilities are almost as stark as the landscape surrounding it. The station is unstaffed, and while some trains do stop here briefly, passengers normally have to remain on the train. The surrounding area is pretty much uninhabited, and the station serves as a stop-off for repairs or emergencies, with few, if any, passengers actually wanting to disembark at Tanggula. But the view from the station (or from the train as it stops or passes by) is impressive. And less than a mile from the station is the Tanggula Pass, which at 16,640 feet above sea level is the highest point of the Qingzang Railway.","The Qingzang Railway, also known as the Qinghai–Tibet Railway, runs from Xining in the Qinghai Province of China to Lhasa in Tibet. There are 45 stations along the Golmud to Lhasa section, 38 of which are unstaffed. Some stations have “scenic platforms” where passengers can disembark briefly to enjoy the scenery, at least during the day. The Tanggula Railway Station was built partly because of its impressive views, but there’s no guarantee that the train will stop, let alone let people off. Ask in advance about the possibly of disembarking at Tanggula, as some services might be more likely to stop than others."
95,The Gates of Hell,Turkmenistan,A fiery crater has been burning in the Karakum Desert since 1971.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-gates-of-hell-turkmenistan,"In the hot, expansive Karakum desert in Turkmenistan, near the 350-person village of Darvaza, is a hole 230 feet wide that has been on fire for over 50 years. Though technically called the Darvaza gas crater, locals know the crater as “The Gates of Hell.” Its fiery glow can be seen for miles around. The Gates of Hell crater was created in 1971 when a Soviet drilling rig accidentally punched into a massive underground natural gas cavern, causing the ground to collapse and the entire drilling rig to fall in. Having punctured a pocket of gas, poisonous fumes began leaking at an alarming rate. To head off a potential environmental catastrophe, the Soviets set the hole alight, figuring it would stop burning within a few weeks. Decades later, and the fiery pit is still going strong. The Soviet drilling rig is believed to still be down there somewhere, on the other side of the “Gates of Hell.” Amazingly, despite the crater’s foreboding name and ever-present flames, people still trek into the desert to witness the site in all its blazing glory. The nearby desert has become a popular place for wild camping. But the fate of the burning crater may be in limbo. In January 2022, President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov ordered the government of Turkmenistan to begin researching how to put the fire out.

96,Köw Ata Underground Lake,"Gokdepe, Turkmenistan",This cavernous swimming spot doubles as a home to the largest known colony of bats in Central Asia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koew-ata-underground-lake,"In Turkmenistan, a sun-scorched Central Asian country where over 80 percent of the land is covered in desert, finding a place to swim can often be a challenge. The landlocked nation has access to the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest lake, but it’s a long way from the capital city of Ashgabat. Most people from the capital region prefer the country’s next best swimming spot—which is located more than 200 feet underground. A long metal staircase leads down into the Bakharden Cave, where the 235-foot-long lake is located. The warm waters contain a high amount of different salts and minerals, most notably sulfur, which is responsible for the distinct smell within the cave. Thus, Köw Ata Underground Lake is also the closest thing Turkmenistan has to a thermal spa. Aside from being a swimming spot and a thermal spa, the cave is also a natural monument, established to protect the largest known colony of bats in the whole of Central Asia. It is a question of personal taste, whether this fact adds to a pleasurable swim or not.","The lake is best visited with your own transportation, and it's about an hour to an hour an a half's drive from Ashgabat. Admission is not free. It's best to bring a change of clothing, so you don't smell like sulfur after visiting the lake."
97,Ancient Merv,"Merv, Turkmenistan",This famed Silk Road oasis was one of the largest cities in the world before it was destroyed by a Mongol horde.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-merv,"One of the most famous cities you’ve (probably) never heard of, Merv served as the capital of a number of empires and kingdoms over the course of its more than 4,000-year-long history. With plentiful water reserves and a supremely strategic location between the Afghan highlands and the Karakum Desert lowlands, Merv was a sought-after geographic prize for Persians, Arabs, Turks, and Greeks alike—including Alexander the Great, who ancient Roman author Pliny the Elder claimed actually first founded the city. Whether or not that’s true, it’s indisputable that Merv was eventually transformed from a simple oasis town into the administrative, commercial, and religious nexus for political dynasties spanning from modern-day Turkey to Central Asia, the Persian Gulf, and beyond. As it changed hands between succeeding empires, Merv’s population swelled to upwards of 500,000 people during the 12th and 13th centuries, making it possibly the third-largest city in the world at the time. That is until Tolui Khan, the fourth son of the notorious conqueror Genghis Khan, and his Mongol army entered the city in 1221. Tolui promptly ordered his soldiers to kill every single one of Merv’s inhabitants, except 400 relatively lucky artisans who were taken prisoner. In all, it’s said the Mongol destruction of Merv left between 700,000 and 1 million people dead, including several hundred thousand refugees that had been seeking shelter nearby and were swept up in the carnage. The attack signaled the end of Merv’s reign as a major Silk Road trading post and prized capital city. Today, however, Merv’s glory shines once again thanks to the efforts of the Turkmenistan government, dedicated academics, and UNESCO, which declared Ancient Merv a World Heritage Site in 1999 (Turkmenistan’s first ever such honor). The resulting efforts have uncovered thousands of years of history once lost to time, including Bronze Age settlements dating back as far as 2500 BC, as well as numerous fortresses, medieval walls, mausoleums, mosques, and more, all in varying stages of preservation. The sheer size of the city and its ruins makes Merv among the most impressive and complex archaeological sites on Earth, delivering a new accolade for the once-renowned world capital.","Merv can be reached in just under one hour (40 km) from the provincial capital, Mary, which is the largest nearby city. There is no public transportation to or from the archaeological park, so travelers must arrange this independently, and considering the vast size of the site, all visitors are advised to have some form of transportation while exploring Merv itself."
98,Nokhur Cemetery,"Nokhur, Turkmenistan",A cemetery with goat-horn bedecked gravestones.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nokhur-cemetery,"At the cemetery of the isolated village of Nokhur, nearly every grave is marked by a wooden post adorned with the horns of a mountain goat. The goat horns are thought to fight off evil spirits and help the souls of the deceased to ensure a safe passage to heaven. In addition to their appearances at the village cemetery, skulls of mountain goats are found at some of the houses’ doorways of the village as well. The Nokhuris, the mountain tribe of the region, have always considered mountain goats sacred animals for their strength and endurance. The reverence of mountain goats clearly predates Islamic traditions, and though today the Nokhuris are devout Muslims, this part of their ancient belief system has continued to survive. The cemetery of Nokhur is an excellent example of how Islam works in Central Asia. Other than in the Middle East, where the arrival of Islam virtually erased all traces of pre-Islamic religions, in Central Asia certain parts of pre-Islamic belief systems have been incorporated into the younger religion, creating a syncretism often symbolized in the burial rites of local tribes.","Visitors are discouraged from entering the cemetery. However, you can still admire the horned graves respectfully from outside the fence."

One of the most surreal sights in the city is a government building known as the Wedding Palace, which is topped by a massive, geometrically caged disco ball globe. Built in 2011, the Wedding Palace is a civil building, but it looks as though it was created by a wealthy eccentric. The lower floors of the white and gold structure are star-shaped and stacked in a staggered fashion so that their points do not overlap. Atop the initial floors is a huge globe that features gold maps of Turkmenistan. The oversized disco ball is enclosed by a frame of eight-sided Turkmen stars. Inside, the building delivers essentially what its name would suggest, acting as both the office where newlyweds can legally register their union as well as a venue in which to hold the ceremony. There are 11 floors in the complex, all devoted to getting people hitched. The grandest hall in the structure, known as the “Shamchyrag,” is located smack in the middle of the giant globe. Unique to the Wedding Palace, couples who wish to tie the knot in the opulent castle must have their photo taken in front of a portrait of the President of Turkmenistan, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. Who better to feature in the pictures of your special day?","It's possible to visit the palace, but you can also admire its unusual architecture from outside. Stop by to see it at night, when it's lit with colored lights. If you're visiting while a wedding is occurring, please be respectful and maintain a courteous distance."
100,Yangykala Canyon,"Balkanabat, Turkmenistan","Few people have ever heard of, let alone visited, one of Turkmenistan’s most impressive natural attractions.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yangykala-canyon,"Turkmenistan is one of the most sparsely populated countries in Asia, and one of the least visited in the world. And out in the far west of this often forgotten country lies a natural attraction that few Turkmen have ever even seen: the Yangykala Canyon, a windblown landscape of colorful canyons and strange formations that stretches some 15 miles across the desert to the Garabogazköl Basin. Yangykala was once underwater, the floor of an ancient ocean that existed millions of years ago. Once that ocean had dried, it left behind a rocky landscape that was slowly eroded by wind and rain, cutting out cliffs and canyons whose walls are now ribbed like the carcasses of strange stranded sea creatures. And then there are the colors: pinks and oranges, reds and yellows, a spectrum of coral shades that give Yangykala Canyon a distinct look. It’s sometimes referred to as the “The Grand Canyon of Central Asia,” but the two are very different. Yangykala had no Colorado River to carve its path, so the actual canyon is far less defined than the Grand Canyon. In many places it looks more like a Martian landscape, pockmarked and chaotic—a place where few humans come and where even the camels look almost lost.","Yangykala Canyon is located in the far northwest of Turkmenistan, about 260 miles northwest of the capital, Ashgabat. You can arrange a three-day tour to the canyon from Ashgabat, or visit it as a day trip from Balkanabat, which is about a four-hour drive from the canyon. The roads are in poor condition, so you need to go by 4x4. There’s also very little in the way of infrastructure or services along the way, so tours must take extra water and fuel in case of emergencies. Once you arrive, you’ll likely be taken to a rock formation known as the “Crocodile’s Mouth” from which you’ll have excellent views of the canyon. To fully appreciate the stunning sunset (and sunrise), you can arrange to camp on a plateau above the canyon. Be prepared, however, as it can be extremely windy and very cold at night."
101,The Walk of Health,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",This harsh mountain path was built as a strange attempt to improve the health of Turkmen citizens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/walk-of-health,"The Turkmen city of Ashgabat is probably one of the weirdest places on Earth. Much of the capital was the brainchild of the longstanding totalitarian president Saparmurat Niyazov, who has become most famous for the obscure laws he decreed like his ban on dogs, lip-syncing in concerts, and the circus. No less bizarre are the architectural monuments that he built during his 15-year-reign in the capital city, of which the Neutrality Arch is probably the most famous. Another one of the strange creations of Niyazov is the Walk of Health, a concrete stairway that runs alongside the treeless Kopet Dag mountains, aimed to improve the health condition of the citizens. The Walk of Health is actually two walks. The first one has a total length of 8 kilometers, and the other has a total length of 37 kilometers. After it was built, Niyazov ordered all ministers, members of parliament and civil servants to hike the entirety of the longer walk once a year. He also expected the population of the city to do the walk at least once per year as well. Niyazov himself watched his staff start the walk, and later flew in his helicopter to the final stage of the walk to greet them on their successfully completed walk. He argued, that his heart condition would not allow him to do the walk himself. In retrospect, he probably wasn’t lying. He died in 2006 of a heart attack. Despite forcing employees to walk for their health, the forced march was counterproductive. Apparently, walking on a concrete stairway for 22 miles without a source of shade in sight, in one of the more extreme climates on Earth, is a health risk. Ironically, following the annual march, many employees took sick days off of work. To make the walk even slightly plausible, the government has begun to plant trees along the shorter walk.",

Although Niyazov’s list of eccentricities is long, some of the highlights are his book of poetry, the Rukhnama, that is mandatory reading for all Turkmen students; renaming months of the year after his family members; commissioning a golden statue of himself that rotates to face the sun as it crosses the sky; and bulldozing the homes of hundreds of residents of the capital city, Ashgabat, to build a Turkmen version of Disneyland. Of course, the amusement park was named after himself: Turkmenbashi’s Land of Fairy Tales. The park opened in 2006 at an estimated cost of $50,000,000 and its 54 attractions span some 100 acres (although not all attractions are currently working). While many of the attractions are typical of amusement parks—a Ferris wheel, log ride, small roller coaster, etc.—visitors may begin to notice some odd quirks. There’s a T-rex in a frozen cavern, the deteriorating facade of a fake British Pub, and an island ruled by a giant concrete Gila monster. But even more disconcerting are the animal scenes spread throughout the park. A cobra sticks its lethal head out of the grass, a leopard stalks a pair of deer, two human-sized rabbits with hollowed out faces wait to greet you, and a pack of wolves creeps behind a herd of antelope—you know, kids’ stuff. Turkmenbashi died in December of 2006, shortly after the park opened. Today, visitors rarely find the park at capacity. Instead, the attraction sits listless and decaying, a flat, brown spot in the middle of Ashgabat’s gleaming white marble apartment buildings.","The amusement park is located toward the center of the city. The amusement park is still open, but it's in need of repair. Ask a cab driver to take you to ""Turkmenbashi Disneyland"" and they'll understand where you want to go."

Inside the cave is a something which looks familiar but slowly reveals itself to be bizarre. The ceilings of the cavern is bedecked with a large number of stalactites. However on closer inspection, one can see the stalactites are not stone, but cloth. Local legend has it that anyone who can fling a mud pie with a cloth attached to it to the ceiling of the cave and make it stick, walks away with a wish granted. Kyrk Gyz Cave means “Forty Girls’ Cave”, a name that refers to a local legend of forty girls who once retreated there, in order to avoid rape and murder by bandits. Once in the cave, the forty girls were fed by a mysterious old woman, whose tomb is said to be located in front of the cave. When the bandits discovered them, the Girls prayed to the Gods, who showed them an escape route through the caverns. What that story has to do with placing mud-soaked cloth stripes to the ceiling of the cave however, remains unclear.",
104,Arch of Neutrality,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",A dictator's gold statue once rotated to face the sun on a 75-meter high marble tower.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arch-of-neutrality,"While the dictator Saparmurat Niyazov banned gold teeth because they offended him, he adored gold statues of himself. As the ruler of Turkmenistan for over two decades, he gilded the country with his own image in a cult of personality that made Mao look modest. The centerpiece was erected in the capital city of Ashgabat. Called the Arch of Neutrality, it was a 75-meter-high rocket-shaped tower topped with a gold statue of Niyazov, which rotated throughout the day so that his face is always basking in the sun. Built in 1998, the marble-covered monument honored his adoption of neutrality as his official policy, and cost over $12 million to create. Niyazov pronounced himself Turkmenbashi, or “Father of All Turkmen,” and “President for Life.” He exerted extensive control over the country, from defining the age at which a person becomes old to forbidding TV presenters from wearing makeup, as he was having trouble telling the men apart from the women. Despite the country having the world’s fourth-largest gas reserves, its five million people lived mostly destitute, while he constructed more and more lavish monuments. One was the colossal statue of the Ruhnama, the rambling, semi-autobiographical philosophical text Niyazov wrote and made required reading for students and anyone taking the driving test. Not content with a ubiquitous image, he renamed the days of the week, months of the year, a meteorite, a moon crater, a breed of horse, airports, a canal, and a city after himself and members of his family. He even changed the Turkmen word for bread to his late mother’s name (Gurbansoltan). His increasingly personal laws included banning beards, long hair, opera, ballet, and circuses, and made it illegal to play recorded music at weddings. No dissent was tolerated under his authoritarian regime, with human rights groups reporting torture, detentions, house demolitions, forced labor, and exile. In 2006, Niyazov died of heart failure. His successor, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, declared in January 2010 that the Arch of Neutrality would be removed and reassembled on the outskirts of Ashgabat. However, it was not until August of 2010 that the statue was finally removed and reassembled on the outskirts of Ashgabat, surrounded by a huge park. The monument is still open to visitors, who can buy tickets for the elevators into the monument to enjoy city views.",

One of the last barriers to total domination of the region, however, were the Turkmen (or Tekke Turkomans), a loose confederation of tribes and soldiers without an organized, singular state. Imperial Russia had tried to conquer what is now known as modern-day Turkmenistan a year earlier, launching an attack on the strategically located Goek Tepe fortress, where some 15,000 Turkmen soldiers and 5,000 women and children were positioned. The Russians, who were badly outnumbered, poorly managed, and ill-equipped, soon retreated. Russian forces returned two years later with approximately 6,000 soldiers and a new general commanding the attack. While the Turkmen still greatly outnumbered the Russians, the foreign forces broke through after a 23-day siege by digging a tunnel under one of the fortress’s stone walls and detonating a mine, breaching the defensive lines. The Turkmen were forced to flee and by the time the battle was over, nearly 15,000 Turkmen soldiers and civilians were killed. The Saparmurat Hajji Mosque was built on the orders of the first President of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Atayevich Niyazov, on the site of the former Geok Tepe fortress to commemorate the Turkmen lives lost in this tragic battle—and, in typical post-Soviet authoritarian fashion, to honor Niyazov’s own pilgrimage to Mecca. The mosque subsequently became something of a national symbol for the country’s struggles and adorned the reverse of one of Turkmenistan’s 10,000 manat notes until a new series of currency was introduced in 2005.","The Saparmurat Hajji Mosque is located approximately 20 miles from Ashgabat, Turkmenistan's capital city. While open to the public, the mosque seems to receive very few visitors and is not used as a regular, everyday place of worship. A museum dedicated to the Battle of Geok Tepe is located on the mosque grounds, with entrance costing $5 USD per foreigner."
106,Independence Monument of Turkmenistan,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",Sumptous memorial to a controversial independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/independence-monument-of-turkmenistan,"The Independence Monument of Turkmenistan is one of the largest and most extravagant of its kind in the entire world. Covering an area of more than 80,000 m², the monument sits in the middle of a landscaped park, with numerous water fountains and pools. Considering its extravagance, many visitors forget that it is situated in a city and surrounding region prone to water shortage. 27 comically looking statues of Turkmen heroes surround the centrepiece of the monument and the golden statue of Turkmenistan’s long-running dictator Niyazov, stands proudly in front of what appears to be a dome, with a minaret-like tower rising from its top. The tower is also adorned in gold and features a viewing platform at its top, as well as the oddly-named Museum of Turkmen Values (which is not much else, but a meagre and extremely overpriced ethnographical collection) within the dome below. But what exactly is so excessively celebrated with the monument remains unclear. It depicts the country’s independence as a huge effort, after a hard struggle to finally break free. However many feel that in reality, Turkmenistan was not at all that eager to gain independence when the Soviet Union collapsed. Niyazov (who was already in charge prior to the collapse of the USSR) at first strongly opposed a dissolution of the USSR, and promoted a reformed Soviet Union rather than a large number of independent states. Just when it was obvious that the Soviet Union had come to an end, Niyazov turned 180 degrees, and in an attempt to keep control over politics in Turkmenistan, before being washed away by a revolution, hastily declared the independence of the country. Independence was proclaimed only two months before the final curtain fell for the Soviet Union. The oversized monument seems to proudly memorize a hard-fought independence with Niyazov at the center of the monument and seemingly the Turkmen independence movement, when in fact, he had tried to prevent the country’s independence until he had no other choice.","Ashgabat, Ahal Welayaty, Turkmenistan"
107,Giant Ruhnama,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",A huge monument to a bizarre book written by Turkmenistan’s longstanding dictator.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giant-ruhnama,"The former president of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov, is probably best known for his strange laws, banning everything from lip-syncing to smelly dogs in the capital city. Yet few people know that Niyazov is also a published author, and created a bizarre work known as “the Ruhnama.” The Ruhnama is something of a manifestation of the personality cult of the longstanding Turkmen president. He wrote the Ruhnama (The Book of the Soul) in 2001 as a spiritual guide for the Turkmen nation, and as an attempt to “Turkmenize” the country. The Ruhnama features a weird combination of revisionist history, moral ideals, religious norms, and fairytales. The first volume was issued in 2001, and a second volume was published three years later. Niyazov ordered that reading the book was mandatory at all schools and universities, and that all new government employees should be tested on the book’s contents. He later even made a test on the Ruhnama an essential element of driving tests. Niyazov was once quoted saying, that God himself told him that everyone who has read the book would come directly to heaven. Often compared to Gaddafi’s infamous Green Book in Libya. Since its publishing, the Ruhnama has largely been met with amusement outside the country. Generally seen as an excellent example of the weird, totalist nature of Turkmenistan’s regime, the book shows the country’s bizarre closeness between the state and the head of state. Even Niyazov’s death in 2006, has not put a damper on the popularity of the book in the regime, and Niyazov’s successor still regards the Ruhnama as an essential part of Turkmen heritage. Despite its strange nature, the book has been translated into several languages, mostly sponsored by foreign companies that received large-scale contracts in return. The Giant Ruhnama is but one of the many weird outcomes of the personality cult of Niyazov, which has turned Ashgabat into one of the most politically bizarre places on Earth, adorned with golden statues of the dictator and freed of all “non-Turkmen“ elements, such as theaters. As of now, Niyazov is the only author self-conscious enough to have created a giant monument to his fictitious work.","Ashgabat, Ahal Welayaty, Turkmenistan"
108,Dekhistan Ruins,Turkmenistan,The remains of a medieval city loom in one of the most isolated desert regions of Turkmenistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dekhistan-ruins,"What’s left of a former flourishing trade city eerily juts out of Turkmenistan’s remote Misrian Valley, the site of medieval Dekhistan. Now in ruins, this area by the Caspian Sea was once a fertile region that supported some 3,000 years of civilization. In its heyday, Dekhistan was a prosperous and strategically located urban center along a caravan route between the ancient realms of Khoresm, an oasis region in Central Asia, and Hyrcania, located southeast of the Caspian Sea in present-day Iran. Dekhistan is believed to have risen in the late 8th century to early 9th century, and comprised nearly 500 acres of fortressed land divided into an old town and a trading and residential district. The capital city of Misrian thrived under the Khwarazmian dynasty, and was notably the site of a medieval mosque with two 80-foot minarets, constructed between the 10th and 12th centuries. The city declined due to the collapse of its advanced irrigation system after extensive deforestation, in conjunction with an invasion by the leader of the Mongol Empire, Genghis Khan. By the 15th century, Dekhistan was completely deserted, and most of the city has been blanketed by sand. The valley has since become arid and infertile, and Dekhistan is now in one of Turkmenistan’s harshest regions. All that remains within the ruins of the city walls are the great mosque’s minarets and portal, as well as bits of former mausoleums and caravanserais.",Tours to the Dekhistan ruins are available for booking through private tour companies.
109,Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",The controversial final resting place of the equally controversial first president of Turkmenistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/turkmenbasy-ruhy-mosque,"The Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque was built by Saparmurat Niyazov, the thoroughly peculiar first president of Turkmenistan. Unlike most mosques, the walls of Türkmenbaşy Ruhy are inscribed, controversially, with scriptures from not only the Quran but also the Ruhnama, Niyazov’s own spiritual guide to life. During the last half-century, few presidents have come close to the sheer weirdness of Niyazov, a repressive dictator who ruled over the sparsely populated country from 1985 until his death in 2006. The leader foisted a long list of bizarre decrees upon his country, including banning lip syncing at public concerts, banishing dogs from the capital city, Ashgabat (citing their “unappealing odor”), and outlawing opera, ballet, and circuses because they were “decidedly unturkmen-like.” He also supposedly banned beards, the use of makeup by television presenters, and gold teeth (he recommended that his people chew on bones instead). Oh, and apparently he did away with the Turkmen word for bread and renamed it gurbansoltan, after his mother. So, yes, Saparmurat Niyazov was eccentric. He was also semi-illiterate, but that didn’t stop him writing a new spiritual guide and a kind of origin story for Turkmenistan. The booked was called the Ruhnama (The Book of the Soul), and it was a rambling mess full of dubious claims. Still, many of his countrymen—89 percent of them being Muslim—ended up reading the Ruhnama, simply because they didn’t have much choice in the matter. Niyazov had copies placed in every school and library across the nation. He made reading it a compulsory part of the national driving test and required reading in schools and universities. Then in 2006, despite earlier claiming it was not a religious text, Niyazov explained how he had talked to God and could now confirm that anyone who read the Ruhnama three times would be guaranteed a place in heaven. Niyazov was obsessed with his book (there’s a giant statue of it in Ashgabat), so much so that he elevated it to the same level as the Quran when he built the Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque—the largest mosque in Central Asia—in 2004. The vast prayer room can hold 10,000 pilgrims, with 7,000 men on the main floor and 3,000 women on the second level. Beneath the mosque is an underground parking area with a capacity for 400 cars. The walls of the mosque were inscribed with verses from both the Quran and the Ruhnama. This, unsurprisingly, outraged many Muslims, who believed that passages from the Quran should be given far more reverence than Niyazov’s modern book of rambling moral guidance, and should not appear alongside each other. Even more incendiary was one particular quotation inscribed prominently on the entry arch to the mosque, which reads “The Ruhnama is the holiest book and the Quran is the book of Allah.” Saparmurat Niyazov, however, wasn’t the kind of person who paid much attention to the trifling complaints of the world’s religious leaders. He left his mosque as it was, resplendent in Italian marble and gold, along with the nearby mausoleum, which is a miniature version of the mosque, built in preparation of his own death. He died in 2006, two years after the mosque was built, and now rests in his mausoleum, surrounded by the words of the Quran and his own hallowed Ruhnama.",The Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque (also known as the Gypjak Mosque) is located just off the M37 highway in the village of Gypjak—Saparmurat Niyazov’s hometown—which lies about 7 miles northwest of Ashgabat city center. It’s also not far from Ashgabat International Airport. The mausoleum is guarded by soldiers and is rarely open to the public.
