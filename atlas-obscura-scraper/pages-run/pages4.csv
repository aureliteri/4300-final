0,Fiat Tagliero Service Station,"Asmara, Eritrea",Eritrea's futuristic gas station is a nod to Italy's fascist history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fiat-tagliero-service-station-asmara-eritrea,"Located in the center of Asmara, Eritrea’s capital city, is the Fiat Tagliero Service Station. Designed by famed Italian architect Giuseppe Pettazzi, this Futurist-style gas station was completed in 1938. Asmara is the largest city in Eritrea and was incorporated as its capital by the Italians during their colonial rule of the African country. Pettazzi built many Art Deco buildings in Eritrea during this time, but this service station— modeled on airplane design as evidenced by its “wings”— is his most famous. The Fiat Tagliero Service Station is a petrol station that includes a central tower with office space, a cashier’s desk, and a shop. The building’s flighty design is widely understood as a problematic nod to Italy’s Fascist history; it was built just months after the country’s airplanes dispensed thousands of sulfur mustard shells over Eritrea, killing tens of thousands of innocent civilians. During construction, authorities attempted to convince the architect that the building’s wings required pillars, as a safety concern. Pettazzi refused to comply and went so far as to threaten the service station’s contractor and an unassuming construction worker with a handgun in a dramatic display of conviction standing atop his creation. Clearly, he felt the supports were not necessary, and he won the argument. Pettazzi’s act is unsurprising, as architects who were too avant-garde for Mussolini’s Fascist Italy (and Europe in general) were sent to Asmara to design wildly imaginative buildings as a way to illustrate Italy’s idea of a modern city in their newly-taken territory. Pettazzi fit the bill. A remarkable example of Italian modernist architecture, the Fiat Tagliero Service Station remains structurally sound to this day and has survived numerous conflicts and war. It was restored in 2003 and is unable to be altered by law. Thanks in part to this striking service station, Asmara was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2017.","The Fiat Tagliero Service Station is found between Mereb Stree and 172-1 Street near Sematat Avenue. You can walk the perimeter of the building and take photos, but entrance into the Fiat Tagliero Service Station is not permitted."
1,Eritrean Railway,"Asmara, Eritrea",Take a ride back in time with a steam locomotive trip through Eritrea’s mountainous countryside.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eritrean-railway,"The Eritrean railway once connected the seaside port city of Massawa to the inland city of Agordot, spanning about 190 miles in total. After falling into disrepair over decades of conflict, sections of the railway are running again with much of the original equipment. Constructed between 1887 and 1932 during Italian colonial occupation, the railroad was meant to extend to the Sudanese border, but construction plans were halted by the Italo-Ethiopian War. The years of the Italian war effort in World War II saw peak ridership of the railway, with hundreds of thousands of passengers and tons of freight traversing the lines. After Italy’s defeat in the war, however, some of Eritrea’s locomotives and cables were seized by the British for use in their nearby East African colony, Kenya. After Eritrea’s annexation by Ethiopia, the railway fell into disrepair and paused service in 1975, closing one year later. After 30 years of intense conflict, Eritrea achieved independence from Ethiopia in 1991, and gained statehood two years later. In 1994, Eritrea’s government began a project to restore parts of the railway, with the Asmara - Massawa line returning to service in 2003. While much of the railway’s ruination was from general neglect and decay, huge parts were destroyed during the struggle for independence. Carriages and locomotives rusted while stations along the line were raided. Although the Eritrean government took foreign bids for reconstruction, it ultimately decided to pursue reconstruction with its own resources. Today, riding the railway is almost exclusively a privilege afforded by private tours. The train only travels about 12 miles per hour, making it difficult for commercial use. The rolling stock equipment used for the ride is the same that was used more than a century ago. While the railway line between Asmara and Massawa is serviceable, it needs upgrades to return to full commercial operation, and many repairs are still needed in order to extend the functional range to all former stations. There are rumored discussions with Sudan, however, for investment in a transnational rail system that would fund a more complete restoration of the system.","Visitors have a few options of tour companies that will help arrange a ride between Asmara and Massawa, but for a steep price. Rates are quoted anywhere between $500 for a ride, to $250 an hour for a 10-hour journey."
2,Tank Graveyard,"Asmara, Eritrea",Wander among hulking piles of rusted machinery left over from the Eritrean-Ethiopian War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tank-graveyard,"The tank graveyard of Asmara is filled with rusted tanks, trucks, and other wrecked vehicles piled in twisty rows through which you can wander. Paths are littered with bits of ammunition and Russian metal plates with C.C.C.P. (the Russian acronym for the U.S.S.R.) stamped on them. But the tank graveyard is more than just an assemblage of destroyed military hardware. It’s a bleak reminder of one of Africa’s longest wars in recent memory—the Eritrean War of Independence, fought between 1961 and 1991, that secured Eritrea’s independence from Ethiopia. Ethiopia, then backed by the Soviet Union, had a large army including tanks, trucks, cars, and machinery currently visible at the tank graveyard. Eritrean soldiers, on the other hand, fought with what they could find. Sandals were composed of tires and captured weapons were the only means of defense. Despite the stark difference in armies, Eritrea’s determination to gain sovereignty allowed them to destroy a significant amount of Ethiopia’s war machinery. Ethiopia hid the evidence of their losses in a site just outside Asmara, knowing that leaving it on the streets would only bolster Eritrea’s morale. In 1991, when Eritrea finally won the war, Eritrean soldiers collected all the military hardware they could find and amassed it into what is now the tank graveyard. The site has turned into a public space that the few tourists who are able to enter Eritrea can visit. To local Eritreans, the site serves as a proud symbol of national liberation, and a reminder of the countless lives lost fighting during the war.","Visitors do need a permit, but it is free. You can get one at the ministry of tourism office. Asmara Grande Tours is also very helpful."
3,Medeber Market,"Asmara, Eritrea","Scrap material from around Eritrea finds a new life at this outdoor market, where upcycling is a lifestyle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/medeber-market,"Piles of discarded metal, rubber, wood, and plastic greet workers and visitors alike to Asmara’s Medeber market. Here, scrap material is repurposed by welders and craftspeople to make new kitchen appliances, furniture, bicycles, household utensils, and more in Eritrea’s capital city. The open-air workshop was used as a caravan trade post in pre-colonial days, until Italian architect Odoardo Cavagnari redesigned the city of Asmara in the early 1900s, about three decades after Italy occupied and colonized Eritrea. From the very beginning, Medeber market was an upcycler’s dream of scrap metal and retired machinery. Innovative craftspeople and artisans recreated essential items that were either rare or extraordinarily expensive in Eritrea, due to high Italian importation fees. Although colonial taxes and tariffs are long past, the handiwork of Medeber’s artisans continues to fill a gap of affordability. Ovens out of oil drums, shovels out of car frames, and pots out of melted food containers—ingenuity knows no bounds here. Medeber’s welders themselves are as iconic as the market, and are known for their unique handmade welding masks made with cardboard, plastic, and other found items. One of the best-known finds at the market are the shida, sandals fashioned from old rubber tires that were so important during the Eritrean war for independence that there’s a giant statue dedicated to them in Asmara. A secondary, though no less impressive, draw of Medeber comes from the smaller spice section, where electric mills crushing ingredients together adds a layer of flavor to the market’s electric cacophony. The best-known spice is called berbere, a powerful flavor eponymous with much Eritrean cuisine. Artists also set up shop at Medeber, selling scarves, bags, clay coffee pots, religious icons, and more. Some sections of the market were damaged in a fire in 2019, but the outdoor marketplace remained largely intact and continues to be an active workspace. Visitors can find Medeber Market behind Asmara’s Nda Mariam Orthodox church and should enter at the layered brick and stone gateway topped by a turret.",
4,Ben Abeba,"Lalibela, Ethiopia",An otherworldly restaurant perched on the edge of a jagged cliff next to a medieval holy city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ben-abeba,"Lalibela, Ethiopia is a holy city, a UNESCO World Heritage site famous for its 12th century churches cut into the rock of the earth. On the opposite end of the architectural spectrum, just a short walk away, is Ben Abeba, a snail shell of a building that looks more like a spaceship landed on top of that rock. Ben Abeba is a restaurant with wide-open spaces, located next to the historic architectural wonders of Lalibela. Perched high on a hill on the north side of town, it’s often described as looking like a bouquet of flowers or some sort of cooking pot. The whole enterprise was the dream of owner Susan Aitchison, a retired home economics professor who came to Ethiopia from her native Scotland, initially to help a friend set up a school. Faced with leaving such a magnificent place and going home to Glasgow, she opted to stay. A chance ride with a local transportation company owner led to a business partnership, and to one of the best restaurants in Lalibela. Aitchison and her partner, Habtamu Baye, hired local architects to put her ideas into motion, and the curved decks jutting out from the building’s central, spiraling staircase give patrons unobstructed views of the breathtaking river valley below. The award-winning restaurant serves a menu mixing traditional Ethiopian dishes and western fare, sometimes combining the two. Rising to the challenges of running a restaurant in a place with sometimes-sketchy electricity and less than reliable refrigeration, they pride themselves on giving valuable training to their young local staff, and especially their sourcing of local ingredients.","Lalibela is in northern Ethiopia, accessible by its small airport about 30 minutes outside of town. Ben Abeba is open from 7 am to 10 pm. General Manager Habtamu Baye also operates a local transportation company which can arrange transfers from local hotels."
5,Bete Giyorgis of Lalibela,"Lalibela, Ethiopia","An Ethiopian ""Jerusalem"" featuring a church hewn out of a single rock.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bete-giyorgis-lalibela,"When young Saint Gebre Mesqel Lalibela was born into the Zagwe Dynasty in Ethiopia, the town of Lalibela was known as Roha. The name Lalibela was given to the young boy when he was surrounded by a swarm of bees soon after birth. His mother believed this was a sign that he would come to rule Ethiopia one day. His name literally means, “the bees recognize his sovereignty.” Lalibela is best known as the king who ordered the construction of 11 monolithic stone churches found in the town today. Lalibela’s goal was to create a new Ethiopian Jerusalem, and he recreated many biblical scenes, such as the stable, out of carved rock. The Bete Giyorgis is by far the most spectacular of these churches. Carved out of the ground, and shaped from the inside out, it is one, unbroken piece of stone. Bete Giyorgis is connected to the other sunken stone churches through a series of elaborate tunnels. There are two versions of the church’s history: one says that the church was built after Lalibela’s death (c. 1220) by his widow as a memorial to the “saint-king.” The other claims  it was a promise  king Lalibela had made to St. George, who had been upset Lalibela had not constructed a church dedicated to him. The church is cut 40 feet down, its roof forming the shape of a Greek cross. Inside the church, there is a curtain that shields the Holy of Holies and a priest displaying books and paintings to visitors. In the shadow of one of the arms of the cruciform-shaped church is a replica of the Ark of the Covenant. Although an explorer was once allowed to open it, he found it empty. No one was able to tell him what happened to its contents. The town of Lalibela is completely isolated from the modern world. Without motor vehicles, gas stations, or paved streets, the town goes about its business as it has for hundreds of years. Religious ritual is central to the life of the town: one tenth of its population is devoted to priesthood. Regular processions, extensive fasts, and crowds of singing and dancing priests are also part of the package. The eleven solid rock churches, in the hills not far from the town, make Lalibela one of the holiest places in Ethiopia. Today, the site is considered one of the centers of pilgrimages for Ethiopian Christians. This atmosphere combined with the religious architecture and simplicity of the town’s way of life, gives the city of Lalibela “a distinctively timeless, almost biblical atmosphere.”",
6,Dallol,"Afar Zone 2, Ethiopia",The hottest place on the planet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dallol,"In the north of Ethiopia, hours from any populated area, is a vast expanse of brutal landscape unlike anywhere else in the world. Dallol, in the Danakil Depression, is a boiling, salt-formed world completely hostile to human visitors. The Danakil Depression, also known as the Afar Depression, holds the distinction of being one of the lowest and hottest parts of the world. On top of average temperatures of 94 degrees Fahrenheit, Dallol itself is surrounded by boiling hot springs, bringing hot minerals and toxic gas bubbles to the surface. Despite making Dallol uninhabited, these geological forces have actually made the area somewhat picturesque, coloring the lowlands with rusty orange, yellow, and green salt formations. Dallol is extremely unwelcoming to inhabitation. However, a number of people have still ventured into the region for work, due to the high deposits of table salt in the area. Expeditions funded by Europe prior to World War I were shut down and dismantled throughout the first half of the 20th century. Later attempts by American, Indian, and Italian companies have resulted in thousands of mines throughout the region, but no permanent settlement. Although it is now uninhabited, small structures made of salt bricks were created by the Afar people, when they were employed by mining companies throughout the 20th century. However, the majority of these have been abandoned and few traces of these settlements still exist. Near the Dallol area in the same region is Erta Ale, the “Gateway to Hell,” a smoking volcanic terrain complete with its own lava lakes. It is an equally harsh and unforgiving environment, and nearly impossible to reach without great difficulty.",
7,Erta Ale,"Afar Zone 2, Ethiopia","Ethiopia's ""smoking mountain"" is in one of the hottest regions on the planet and is home to two lava lakes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erta-ale,"Located in the Danakil Depression (or Afar Depression) in the Afar Region of northeastern Ethiopia, Erta Ale is one of the driest, lowest and hottest places on earth. Temperatures during the year range from 77°F to 118°F. The area is beset by drought, bereft of trees, and has little in the way of roads. Known by the Afar as the “smoking mountain” and “the gateway to hell,” Erta Ale is a 2,011-foot-high constantly active basaltic shield volcano. It is one of only a handful of continuously active volcanos in the world, and a member of an even more exclusive group: volcanos with lava lakes. While there are only five known volcanos with lava lakes globally, Erta Ale often has two active lava lakes – making it a unique site. Erta Ale was discovered in 1906, making it the longest-known lava lake. For a lava lake to exist, the surface of the lake and the magma chamber below must form a constant convecting system, or the entire thing will cool and solidify. Beneath the ground surrounding Erta Ale is an enormous pool of active magma. The lake goes through cycles and will cool, form a black layer on top, and then suddenly convect back into liquid lava. Occasionally, due to pressure, “fountains” of lava will form, spewing lava in 6- to 13-foot-high plumes. The volcano itself has erupted in 1873, 1903, 1940, 1960, 1967, and 2005, when it killed hundreds of livestock and forced thousands to flee. In 2007 lava flows once again forced evacuation and two people went missing, and were presumably killed. Despite the harsh conditions, danger of volcanic eruption, and extreme heat, Erta Ale has become something of a tourist destination recently. Whereas in 2002 the area was accessible only by helicopter, today adventure tourism groups take trips to the volcano lakes and it is now possible to drive within 4.3 miles of the volcano.",Recent reports indicate that the level of the lake has gone down significantly and the lava is now obscured from view by smoke. Check with recent visitors (not tour companies) before you go or you may be surprised when you’re unable to see the lava you’ve been seeing in photographs.
8,Manyate Coffee Village,"Bale Mountains National Park, Ethiopia",An Ethiopian cloud forest protects some of the last wild arabica plants.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/manyate-coffee-village,"The Harenna forest lies about 250 miles southeast of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Protected within Bale Mountains National Park, the rainforest hides a tangle of flora beneath the shroud of an often-present, low-lying cloud. And tucked among the dense greenery grows some of the world’s last wild coffee. Most people have never tasted wild coffee. Farmers who cultivate the crop are almost exclusively responsible for all commercially-available beans. Ethiopia is home to some of the last remaining wild arabica plants (according to a 2017 study, nearly 60 percent of the world’s wild coffee is under threat of extinction). You can sample a cup made from these plants at Manyate Coffee Village, situated on Harenna’s southern edge. Here, at an altitude of around 5,250 feet, arabica flourishes under the shade of massive, mossy trees. Farmers living in the area depend on the crop for income, and approximately 3,000 individuals gather coffee cherries from the Harenna forest. Harvesters select the bright red fruit by hand, a process that, according to Slow Food International, “is often obstructed by baboons.” After collection, no processing or cleaning is required; farmers simply leave their yield to dry in suspended nets or beneath the sun. Residents of Manyate established a community group known as the Sankate Association to better develop the forest’s small-scale industries. Visitors can try native coffee and honey, purchase artisan crafts, go camping, and take guided tours. Sankate’s coffee house offers traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremonies, and, during harvest season, guests can pluck their own ripened cherries.","Bale Mountains National Park is responsible for a variety of important natural features. Locals also practice traditional forms of beekeeping and honey collection from beehives housed in the forest. The mountain nyala, an endangered species of antelope, lives in the park's highlands. Instructions for reaching Bale can be found here."
9,Abuna Yemata Guh,"East Tigray, Ethiopia","Reaching the ""Church in the Sky"" requires scaling the cliff face of a sandstone pinnacle with a 650-foot drop.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abuna-yemata-guh-church,"If you think going to a normal church can be an enlightening experience, imagine going to worship in a rock-hewn painted cave atop a towering sandstone pinnacle, only reachable via a daredevil climb with 650-foot drops on all sides. At Abuna Yemata Guh in northern Ethiopia, this risky and thrilling experience is common practice for a few dedicated priests. The monolithic place of worship is said to be the world’s most inaccessible and dangerous church, reachable only by a 45-minute ascent. The journey has cliff faces to scale, rickety bridges to cross, and narrow ledges to traverse. After crossing through the valley that underlies the church, you must ascend the half-mile-high sandstone pinnacle, searching for rare footholds to avoid the long drop. Adding to the general sense of dread, the route passes by an open-air tomb filled with the skeletal remains of deceased priests (although it’s said that none of the priests died from falling off the cliff). If the intense climb and the gorgeous view of the valley below aren’t enough to take your breath away, the interior of the church surely will. The cave’s ceiling is covered by two beautiful frescoes, featuring intricate patterns, religious imagery, and the faces of nine of the twelve apostles of Christ. The church also contains an Orthodox Bible with vibrant, colorful sheets made of goatskin. Abuna Yemata Church is so sacred that some Ethiopian parents even risk bringing their babies all the way to the top of the cliff to have them baptized there. The church is named after Father Yemata, a priest who carved the church out of the cliff face in the 5th century. Some say he chose the high location to escape enemies, while others believe it was an attempt to find true divinity. Either way, his rock-hewn masterpiece has provided a unique opportunity for Ethiopian Christians to demonstrate their commitment to their faith in epic fashion.",
10,Chapel of the Tablet,"Aksum, Ethiopia","Supposedly this Ethiopian chapel holds the Ark of the Covenant, guarded by virgins who cannot leave the building.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapel-of-the-tablet,"The popular image of the Ark of the Covenant was immortalized in Raiders of the Lost Ark,  but supposedly the real life Ark is held in this Ethiopian chapel, guarded by a virgin sentinel who must never leave the building. The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion is said to have existed in some form on this spot since around the 4th century CE. As the story goes, the Ark was brought to Ethiopia, by the son of the Queen of Sheba, and placed in the church where it has stayed ever since. The structures of the church have been destroyed and rebuilt a number of times over the years. The current domed church building was built in the 1950s by Emperor Haile Selassie. Despite their continued claims to have the Ark stored away in the catacombs of the Chapel of the Tablet, no one seems to have seen it. The only person who is allowed to see the artifact is the Guardian of the Covenant, the appointed guard of the Ark. This guard must be a virgin and they are chosen by the previous guard prior to their death. Once a guard is chosen, they supposedly cannot leave the chapel, lest the Ark go unguarded. Not even the leader of the Ethiopian church can see the Ark. Whether or not the Ark truly resides beneath the chapel, the site still draws thousands of pilgrims each year, who come and view the chapel from outside the red fence that keep the faithful on the perimeter.",
11,Obelisk of Axum,"Aksum, Ethiopia",Massive stele returned to Ethiopia after 70 years in Rome.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aksum-obelisks,"Considering the size of the Obelisk of Axum, it is truly amazing that it was transported between continents twice during the last 100 years. However, for many people in Ethiopia, the return of the massive stele was an important milestone in bolstering national pride and celebrating Ethiopia’s history. From the early 4th century B.C.E until the 10th century C.E, the Kingdom of Axum was one of the greatest powers on earth. Centered as a trade city between Persia and Rome, the city of Axum flourished in culture, power and wealth. A pagan Kingdom during its early peak, giant pillars were erected to mark the tombs of important leaders. In the 4th century, the King Ezana of Axum solidified the Kingdom’s conversion to Christianity, and stopped all pagan practices, including the erection of burial stelea such as the 80-foot Obelisk of Axum. Standing only until the 16th century, an earthquake likely toppled the obelisk, and without any importance in a Christian society it was left in multiple pieces to disintegrate back into sand. The Obelisk lay in ruin for hundreds of years until it was re-discovered by Italian soldiers during the conquest of Ethiopia in 1935. Brought back in three pieces, the 160-ton stele was taken as loot to Rome, where it was reassembled. After world war II, the UN ruled that the stele must be returned to Ethiopia, but complications arose almost immediately. After years of fighting and delays, the Obelisk was finally returned to Ethiopia in 2007. The pieces were re-assembled and the Obelisk was placed near two other famous stelea; the Great Stelea standing at 108 feet, and the King Ezana stele, erected to the King that outlawed their use when he brought Christianity to his kingdom.",
12,The Afar Rift,"Afar Zone 1, Ethiopia","An ocean in the making, in the Ethiopian desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-afar-rift-afar-zone-1-ethiopia,"Plate tectonics is not a spectator activity. The Afar Depression, for example, pulls apart at the staggering rate of less than an inch per year. Given 30 million years, however, even slow progressions such as this one can produce dramatic results. The Arabian and African Plates meet in the Afar Desert in Northern Ethiopia, and in 2005 a 10-day period of seismic activity led to a 35 mile rift that is over 20 feet wide at certain points. The eruption of Dabbahu, a volcano at the northern edge of the rift, signaled the start of a series of volcanic breaches in the Earth’s crust that shot magma and clouds of ash into the sky and sent earthquakes throughout the region. Researchers have taken particular interest in the Afar Rift because of new studies indicating that changes observed there mimic those that occur in ocean formation thousands of miles below sea-level. Indeed, it is now believed that within the next million years the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden will both pour into the Depression and meet, creating a new ocean in what is now desert. Scientists hope that by studying the Rift they might gain insight into processes that have, up until this point, been shrouded in mystery. Activity in underwater mantle usually occurs too deep in the ocean to be monitored by current technology, and already the data from the 2005 eruptions have challenged theories as to how oceans were created.",
13,Yemrehanna Kristos Church,Ethiopia,An ancient Ethiopian cave church is endangered by the simple building of a road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yemrehana-krestos-church,"The ancient Yemrehanna Kristos Church in Ethiopia is not only located in a cave, but may be one of the most elaborate churches of its kind in the entire country. Believed to have been built between the 11th and 12th century, the wood and plaster church is nestled inside a natural cavern that has likely kept the church from deteriorating completely over its centuries of service. The exterior of the church face consists of stacked layers of protruding stonework interlaced with wooden beams. The windows are covered with wooden cruciform designs and the main door is said to have been taken from a nearby palace. Inside the church, the walls are covered in wood paneling. There are also tall wooden arches which have delicate designs carved into their every surface. Over the centuries, the church has been a relatively popular pilgrimage site where devoted pilgrims were known to come to die. Their bones are buried behind the church into the cave wall. The church is still in active service to this day, and a security wall has been erected over the cave mouth to keep the site safe. Although the church is far off the beaten path, a new road has brought newfound attention and visitors which may jeopardize the safety of the ancient architecture. In the interest of retaining the site’s unique historical value, the Yemrehanna Kristos Church was recently placed on the 2014 World Monuments Watch list of important places to preserve.",
14,Hadar Archaeological Site,"Shinile, Ethiopia","The skeletal remains of the famous hominid ""Lucy"" were found at this spot.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hadar-lucy-hominid-skeleton,"On November 24, 1974, paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson spotted something odd poking out from a dry gully within the archeological site around Hadar, Ethiopia. There, a thin arm bone was visible against the dry, dusty earth. Johanson kept looking and soon found additional skeletal remains—a femur here, some ribs there—scattered nearby. By the end of the excavation, Johanson and his colleagues had unearthed about 40 percent of a roughly 3.2 million-year-old skeleton. These bits of bone were the only pieces they could work with while puzzling together the identity of “Lucy,” the now world-famous hominid. Though officially named AL 288-1, Lucy was given her more popular moniker as a nod to the Beatles song that was played repeatedly during the camp’s celebrations honoring her discovery. By studying her remains, the researchers were eventually able to determine that Lucy is a member of the Australopithecus afarensis species, a hominid that went extinct about 2.9 million years ago. After reading the clues hidden in the fragments of her skeleton, they also concluded that the ancient female walked upright and died when she was only a young adult. Lucy’s skeleton wasn’t the only hominid unearthed at Hadar. The fossilized skull of Selam, a three-year-old hominid that died about 3.3 million years ago, was discovered during a later dig. Other hominid remains have been found spread throughout the sedimentary rocks as well.",

Ethiopia is known for its rich wealth of megalithic sites and well preserved prehistoric finds, but the 30-some stones located in the Tiya region are among the most remarkable. Each of the squat stone obelisks is carved with primitive, yet clear images of swords, geometric shapes, and figures. Despite a healthy amount of research at the site, no one has been able to determine the exact age or purpose of the stones, although popular thinking has it that they served a funerary function due to some tombs which were found nearby. Whatever the true use of the carved rocks, they offer a relatively pristine glimpse back to a time we know little about.",Take Route 7 south of Addis and then go south on Route 9.

16,Red Terror Martyrs' Memorial Museum,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",A powerful tribute to the victims who suffered under Ethiopia's most devastating regime.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-red-terror-martyrs-memorial-museum-addis-ababa-ethiopia,"The “Red Terror” Martyr’s Memorial Museum in Addis Ababa was unveiled in 2010 to honor the victims of Mengistu Haile Mariam’s Derg Regime. Anywhere between 500,000 and 750,000 people were tortured and killed during the brutality. The museum is a memorial to the martyrs who fought against the dictator’s violent military campaign. Although the museum is modern, clean, and well presented, it doesn’t pull any punches. It’s full of coffins, bloodied clothes, and images that tell the story of this devastating period in the country’s history. One particular room contains a number of glass-fronted partitions displaying the remains and personal effects of people killed by the regime. The remains had been exhumed and placed in the museum as they had been found. Some of them even included the rope used to strangle the person. Each partition also includes a photo of the victim. Ethiopia’s “Red Terror” reached its height between 1977 and 1978. Men, women, and children from various ethnic groups were tortured and killed under the dictator’s plan to rid the country of those who allegedly opposed his party. Citizens were captured and tortured before their dead bodies were dumped in the streets. Some of the museum guides themselves are victims of the terror, pointing out that they too suffered the various methods of torture displayed in graphic detail by mannequins. The museum is free but does rely on donations. After witnessing the exhibits in this building it would be hard not to leave a generous sum.",
17,Gaet’ale Pond,"Afar Zone 2, Ethiopia",The Earth's saltiest natural body of water belches toxic gas.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gaetale-pond,"Gaet’ale Pond is the saltiest naturally-occurring body of water on Earth. It also belches out toxic gas that kills small birds, insects and, potentially, humans. The Afar Depression in northern Ethiopia is one of the most tectonically active regions in the world. Shaped by volcanic activity, the floor of the depression is largely composed of lava, and the area is riddled with fascinating natural formations that bake in the scorching sun. One such feature is Gaet’ale Pond, the largest of a series of small bodies of water a few miles from Dallol, one of the hottest inhabited locations on Earth. The roughly semi-circular lake has a diameter of about 197 feet. According to locals, it was formed after an earthquake in January 2005. Despite its balmy 122-to-155-degree Fahrenheit temperature, Gaet’ale Pond is certainly not the place for a hot dip in the water. It often belches out toxic gases, as evidenced by the dead insects and birds often found near its shores, and researchers consider it a dangerous—and potentially lethal—health hazard for human visitors. But what really sets Gaet’ale Pond apart is its salt content. Thanks to volcanic processes in the area, the pond has an incredibly high salinity of 43 percent (mainly calcium chloride and magnesium chloride), making it the saltiest body of water on Earth. To put that into perspective, the water in Gaet’ale Pond is more than 12 times saltier than the water in the world’s oceans, which have a salinity of approximately 3.5 percent. The world’s most famous salty sea, the Dead Sea, has a salinity of 33.7 percent. And the world’s second saltiest body of water, Don Juan Pond in Antarctica, has a salinity of at least 33.8 percent.","Gaet’ale Pond is located about 2.5 miles to the southeast of Dallol, a sparse settlement (some call it a ghost town) in the Afar Region of northern Ethiopia. The nearest town is Berhale, about 31 miles to the southwest (as the crow flies), which is reached by heading east off Ethiopian Highway 2. The region has very minimal tourism infrastructure, so you need to plan ahead carefully. Tour companies also offer multiday trips to the Dallol area, which typically include Gaet’ale Pond. As mentioned above, be careful when approaching the pond as the gases can be harmful to humans."
18,Lioness of Gobedra,Ethiopia,"According to one local legend, this image was created during a battle between a wild lioness and the archangel Michael.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lioness-of-gobedra,"A couple of kilometers west of the ancient city of Axum stands the isolated hill of Gobo Dura, alternatively known as Gobedra. The city in Ethiopia is known for stonework, including elaborately carved stelae and a striking work of ancient art known as the Lioness of Gobedra. It was first described to the western world by German archaeologists in 1913, but had been known to locals for far longer. The origin of the three-meter-long sculpture, engraved on a huge syenite boulder, has been a mystery for quite some time. One local story holds that the carving is a relic from a tremendous battle between a wild lioness and the archangel Michael. It is said that when Michael hurled his opponent into the rock, the impact was so great that the beast’s outline remained. The truth is still a subject of speculation, but the stone lioness is likely thousands of years old. Since it stands beside the road leading to Axum, it is possible that the rock art was an ancient landmark. This has not been confirmed, and it remains unknown when it was created, who made it, or for what purpose. Another engraving that depicts a Greek cross is also visible on the same boulder, also of unknown origins. Nearby, there is an ancient quarry called Wuchate Golo, where the famous stelae in Axum are believed to have been carved. Some uncompleted, abandoned stelae can be spotted here as well.",
19,Chemin de Fer Railway Museum,"Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",Rusting railcars and locomotive equipment fill this Ethiopian train graveyard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chemin-de-fer-railway-museum,"Usually when a rail line is decommissioned, the cars and equipment simply disappear, sold off or thrown away, but this old Ethiopian line has been turned into a sort of rusty folk museum. The Railway Station at Dire Dawa was the only formal waystation on the railway line which operated from Djibouti on the coast to Addis Ababa in the Ethiopian highlands. The railway line which was constructed and operated by a French company the Chemin de Fer Ethiopien began operations in the reign of Emperor Menelik II and was completed in 1929. The Railway Line ceased running in the early 2000s and is currently being upgraded into a more modern service. However, when the service stopped, most of the rolling stock, trains, and carriages ended up in the Dire Dawa Station where a museum of sorts has been established. The museum is a wonderful collection of train memorabilia slowly decaying in the Ethiopian sun. One will receive a tour from the curator, an elderly man who was employed by the railway and speaks a smattering of English, fluent Amharic, and good French, the operational language of the railway. French signs can still be seen hanging in the workshops and there are railway carriages from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd classes dating from the 1950s. There are a selection of diesel engines and some minor gems such as the rusted shell of an Italian locomotive from the 1940s and some wagons supposedly gifted to the former Communist regime by Mugabe and used to transport tanks. Wandering around, with bee-eaters providing little bursts of color as they flit between the old telegraph wires, the curator is perfectly happy for all the exhibits to be handled and clambered on, actively encouraging people to “get in,” unafraid that a little bit more of an engine may crumble into the rust colored soil.","Once you arrive in Dire Dawa, get a Bajaj from the airport to the Mekonnen Hotel, opposite the station. There is good beer on the veranda. The entrance to the museum is through a gateway to the left of the main station building. There will be a policeman on guard here who will likely not speak English. If persistent he will phone the curator who will arrive in about 20mins. A guide or rudimentary Amharic are helpful. There was no formal charge for the museum but contributions are welcome."
20,Fendika Azmari Bet,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","This nightlife venue and cultural center keeps a unique Ethiopian musical tradition alive in the nation’s capital, but breakneck urban development threatens to shut it down.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fendika-azmari-bet,"Azmaris are Ethiopian bards, poet-musicians as skilled in lyrical double-entendre and pun as they are with their instruments. They are comparable to the griots of West Africa, who capture the cultural history of their communities in verse and song and the troubadours of middle-ages Europe, wandering composers and performers of lyrical poetry. Azmaris are traditionally involved in many aspects of Ethiopian life, from marriages and religious celebrations to quiet nights at rural bars. Azmari instruments of choice are the masenqo, a single-stringed lute played with a bow whose melodies can jump from lively to haunting, and the krar, a multi-stringed harp lute, sometimes with accompanying percussion. An azmari bet is a venue that hosts Azmari music (bet means house). These venues remain prevalent in rural areas and small towns, but they have gradually disappeared from Addis Ababa over the last 30 years as the city’s rapid development pressures land uses that urban planners see as lower-value. This marginalization in the country’s center of government, culture, and economy is a risk to the future of the unique Azmari tradition. Fendika, which has now expanded beyond its origin as an azmari bet to include a cultural center, started in the 1990s as one of the many such venues in its neighborhood. It is the only one left in the neighborhood, and one of the few in Addis. In 2008, its management transferred to legendary longtime Azmari performer and dancer Melaku Belay. Melaku travelled widely in the Horn of Africa to infuse diverse regional traditions into his music, and brings this diversity to the live performances at Fendika as well as his group’s recorded music. A night at Fendika begins with a generous glass of tej, Ethiopian honey mead. Patrons then settle in for azmari performances that can set a variety of tones, from vigorous dance parties to emotional ballads. Perhaps the most interesting type is when the amzari walks around from group to group throughout the audience, inventing creative lyrics to poke fun at their listeners until they receive a tip to move on to the next group. Audience members take the verbal jabs in stride and, aided by the tej, the whole place rolls with laughter. The space is littered with cultural items, and packed on live performance nights with local clientele. Like many other places in Ethiopia, Fendika is unabashedly Ethiopian; it makes no attempt to change or present itself for the foreign eye, while still welcoming foreign visitors into its world. Fendika’s plans for the future are grand, including multipurpose spaces to accommodate and record artists from around the world, cultural archives, and a musical workshop. Pressure from government and land developers is strong, but for now at least, Fendika remains a beacon for a tradition that makes our world a whole lot more interesting.","Fendika's official website has a detailed calendar of events- something is happening most evenings, starting by 8 p.m. and going late into the night. Performances and audience interaction are only in Amharic, so it’s ideal to go with a friend or guide who speaks it if you don’t. Still, music is a universal language. The honey alcohol may be stronger (and cause stronger hangovers) than it seems. First-time drinkers are advised to tread carefully."
21,Sebastopol Artillery Mortar Replica,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",This roadside monument commemorates the huge weapon built by an Ethiopian emperor's hostages.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sebastopol-artillery-mortar,"This replica of a giant mortar stands in the middle of an Ethiopian traffic circle. The weapon it commemorates was built by the Christian hostages of an Ethiopian emperor and was abandoned atop a hill, where it still lies today. When the Ethiopian Emperor Tewodros II accepted Christian missionaries into his capital, it was not for their religious guidance. The Christian monarch was after their science, and more specifically, their help in building ever larger cannons and mortars. In the mid-1850s, Emperor Tewodros II had a vision for a modern, industrialized Ethiopia. The Christian ruler dreamed of restoring a strong monarchy, ending the slave trade, and creating a modern military that would keep Ethiopia strong and safe. But to do this he would need the support of foreign powers, in particular, the British, and their knowledge of weaponry. The British, however, were not as accommodating as Tewodros would have liked. The Emperor wrote a letter to Queen Victoria asking her to send skilled workers to teach his subjects how to produce firearms, but the letter was ignored. Tewodros, therefore, turned to the European missionaries who had come to Ethiopia, seeking not their religious guidance but their scientific knowledge. At the time, he told his British confidant John Bell that “he would have been more pleased with a box of English gunpowder” than with their religious books. So he commandeered the missionaries as his weapon makers, placing them all in a precarious position: they would try their best to produce cannons and mortars, or risk upsetting the monarch. None of them, however, had any direct knowledge of how to make weapons; at best they had some experience with casting metal. A foundry was built at Gafat, and the missionaries managed to build a succession of mortars and cannons of dubious quality, with Tewodros demanding increasingly larger weapons. The pinnacle of all this trial-and-error cannon making was a seven-ton mortar that Tewodros named Sebastopol, after the site of a battle during the Crimean War. Capable of firing half-ton artillery rounds—at least in theory—Sebastopol was the pride of the Ethiopian arsenal, which now numbered 15 cannon and seven mortars. Still, Tewodros was not happy with the standard of his weapons and sought further help from the British. But this was when things started going wrong for the modernizing Ethiopian monarch. After two years of waiting, Tewodros was still hoping for a reply from Queen Victoria. But his patience was just about spent. Angered, he took hostage the British Consul in Ethiopia, Captain Charles Duncan Cameron, the very man who was supposed to personally deliver the letter into the hands of Victoria. He also imprisoned all the British subjects in Ethiopia, along with various other Europeans who happened to be passing through, in an attempt to get the Queen’s attention. This was a very bad idea. On December 21, 1867, a British force was dispatched from Bombay. It included 13,000 troops supported by 8,000 auxiliary workers, thousands of mules, hundreds of camels, and 44 Indian elephants. Tewodros moved his forces to the mountain stronghold of Magdala (present-day Amba Mariam), along with his prisoners and his arsenal. Dragging cannons and mortars up the mountainside, however, was no easy feat. Sebastopol alone needed 800 people to drag it up the steepest parts, and what was normally a weeklong journey instead took months. It was tough going for the British, too, who took nearly two and a half months to cross the arid plains, hills, and mountains on the way to Magdala. But when the two sides finally engaged in battle, British firepower proved devastating. Their new breech-loading Snider rifles obliterated the onrushing musket- and spear-bearing Abyssinian forces. The artillery that Tewodros had for so long coveted proved next to useless. Many pieces failed to fire, and many others never made it up the mountain. No record exists of Sebastopol ever being used in the battle. If it did make it into a firing position, which itself is unlikely, there’s a strong possibility that it would have misfired. What is certain is that no one ever had the motivation to bring Sebastopol back down from Magdala. It still sits up on the plateau near the old fortress, green with rust and with only a wooden fence surrounding it. There is, however, a bronze replica of Sebastopol on display at the center of a roundabout at Tewodros Square in Addis Ababa. As for Emperor Tewodros II, he retreated to the fortress after his defeat at the Battle of Magdala, released his hostages and then died by suicide. Some claim that he shot himself with a pistol given to him as a gift by Queen Victoria: the only weapon the British monarch ever gave to the Ethiopian Emperor.","The original Sebastopol mortar sits up on Magdala (Makdala) Hill near Amba Mariam, about 170 miles north of Addis Ababa. Strong trekkers can get their on foot as a long day trip from the town of Tenta, but most visitors take a tent and camp on the hill overnight, where locals can provide water and firewood (but not always food). If that sounds like too much effort, then you can go see the replica, which stands on Tewodros Square, inside a roundabout along Churchill Avenue in central Addis Ababa."

24,Oklo Reactor,"Mounana, Gabon",The world's first and only natural nuclear reactor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oklo-reactor,"Many people think nuclear power is an invention of mankind, and some even think it violates the laws of nature. But nuclear power is in fact a naturally occurring phenomenon, and life could not exist without it. That’s because our sun (and every other star for that matter) is itself a giant power plant, lighting up the solar system through a process known as thermonuclear fusion. Humans, however, generate power through a different process called nuclear fission, which releases energy by splitting atoms rather than combining them as in the fusion process. No matter how ingenious our race may seem though, even fission reactors are old news to Mother Nature. In a singular but well-documented circumstance, scientists have found evidence that naturally occurring fission reactors were created inside three uranium ore deposits in the west African country of Gabon. Two billion years ago, the uranium-rich mineral deposits became flooded with groundwater, setting off a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. The energy that was subsequently released then raised temperatures enough to begin boiling away the water, but when the mineral deposits eventually cooled down the nuclear reactions would start back up again. By examining the levels of certain isotopes of xenon gas (a byproduct of the uranium fission process) in the surrounding rock, scientists have determined the natural reactor proceeded in this start-stop fashion at intervals of about two and a half hours. In this manner, the uranium deposits in the Oklo region of Gabon created a natural nuclear power plant that operated for hundreds of thousands of years until most of the fissile uranium was depleted. While a majority of the uranium at Oklo is the non-fissile isotope U238, only about 3% needed to be the fissile isotope U235 for the chain reaction to start. Today, that percent of fissile uranium in the deposits is around 0.7%, indicating that the deposit had sustained reactions for a relatively long period of time. But it was this exact characteristic of the rocks from Oklo that first puzzled scientists. The low levels of U235 were first noticed in 1972 by employees of the Pierrelatte uranium enrichment facility in France. During routine mass spectrometry analysis of samples from the Oklo mine, it was discovered that the concentration of the fissile uranium isotope differed by three thousandths of a percent (0.003%) from the expected value. This seemingly small difference was significant enough to alert authorities, who were concerned that the missing uranium could be used to develop nuclear weapons. But later that year, scientists found the answer to the two-billion-year-old secret: the world’s first, and only natural, nuclear reactor.",

Located in the thick tropical jungle of Kakum National Park, the canopy walk was actually designed by a pair of Canadian engineers and five Ghanaians. Looking to increase tourism (specifically ecotourism) in the largely ignored national park, the designers wanted to create a unique feature that would make the park a destination, thus an elevated trail through the canopy was devised. Opened on Earth Day in 1995, the canopy walkway consists of seven separate bridges that hang from the trees over 130 feet above the ground. Across over 1,000 feet of walkway, the bridges look as though they are constructed like a traditional rope bridge made from the materials of the forest, however the sturdy spans are made of wire rope, aluminum, and wooden planks, and even have safety netting to keep people from plummeting off the trail.","Easiest to visit by car but you can easily find a taxi for a day trip in Cape Coast.

The aircraft sits along the route to Kotoka International Airport in Accra, Ghana’s capital city, but it won’t take you anywhere. However, the food is a far cry from the tray of disappointment that most passengers are accustomed to picking at while aboard a plane. Now a restaurant known as La Tante DC 10, this aircraft was once operated by Ghana Airways on flights to Europe and the United States. In 2005, the DC-10 ended up impounded at London’s Heathrow airport as a result of unpaid company debts. Nearly a decade later, a business partnered with Ghana Airports Company Limited, to transform the retired vehicle into an eatery. Today, curious visitors and residents alike can enjoy unique meal service delivered by waitstaff in flight attendant uniforms. Customers board just as they would an operational vessel, by embarking up a covered stairway. For some, it’s their first look inside an airplane. The plane’s new management reduced capacity from 380 seats to 118, clearing space for wider walkways and dining tables. First-class seats accented with festive pillows serve as a waiting area and bar seating, while the economy section houses the dining room, which is composed of tables with rows of airplane seats facing each other.

27,Cape Coast Castle,"Cape Coast, Ghana","Where thousands of slaves passed through the ""Door of No Return.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cape-coast-castle,"When President Obama visited Ghana’s Cape Coast Castle in July, 2009, he remarked that “it reminds us of the capacity of human beings to commit great evil.” This castle in Cape Coast, Ghana—once known as the Gold Coast of West Africa—was one of around 40 “slave castles” that served as prisons and embarkation points for slaves en route to the Americas (the Caribbean, South America, and the U.S.). Thousands of enslaved Africans from regions near and far, sometimes hundreds of miles away, were taken to these castles to be sold to slave ships. One of the most well known parts of Cape Coast Castle, that you can visit today, is the “Door of No Return,” which led slaves out of the castle and onto the ships setting off on the Middle Passage. Their boat journeys could last several months, and an estimated 15 percent of slaves died aboard, en route. Somewhere around 12 millions slaves were sent from Africa, millions of whom died in the process. Cape Coast Castle was a way station in history’s largest, and darkest, forced human migration. The history of the castle, which could also be termed a fort, is predictably complicated and contentious. Possession of it was stolen back and forth as the slave trade grew bigger and more lucrative in the 1600s and 1700s. The site’s first establishment was built by the Swedish Africa Company, whose officers had established good relations with local chiefs. In 1650, Swede Hendrik Caerloff finagled the King of Fetu’s permission to build a fort, and in 1653, Carlusborg Fort was erected. It was snatched by the Danish West India Company in 1657, and seized back and forth between the Danish, Dutch, and Swedes, competitors in the growing slave economy. When the King of Fetu died in 1663, the Dutch seized control for a hot second before the British swooped in, in 1664. The British renamed it Cape Coast Castle and managed to maintain possession, though there were a few close calls. In 1757, for example, an attack by the French badly damaged the fort, leading to a complete reconstruction. Tens of thousands of bricks and tiles were imported from England in 1797 for the reconstruction effort, which was also intended to expand the castle’s slave-holding capacity. When you visit Cape Coast Castle today, the main destination in the calm and breezy seaside town of Cape Coast, you can tour the entire expansive building, from the ramparts lined with cannons to the nearly lightless dungeons. These dungeons, called “slave holes” by the British, had essentially no ventilation nor windows, with 200 slaves, separated by gender, crammed in one room, and the floor covered in human waste. Diseases like malaria and yellow fever were common under such wretched conditions. As many as 1,500 slaves (two-thirds of whom were male) were held in the castle dungeons at any one time. When you walk through the dungeons today, it is terrifying to imagine the reality of what took place in these suffocating spaces just over two centuries ago. Then, moments later, you’ll be out of the dungeons and wandering by the church or strolling down long hallways leading to officer’s quarters with pleasant views over the sea—two adjacent spaces set entire worlds apart. The Brits formally declared the slave trade illegal in 1807, though Cape Coast Castle remained their local headquarters on the Gold Coast until 1877. The British Public Works Department later restored the premises in 1920s, and retained ownership right up until Ghana’s independence in 1957, at which point the castle came under the purview of the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board. Though the remains of other slave castles exist along the former Gold Coast, Cape Coast Castle is one of the most well restored and well known. It is well worth a visit to remind each of us of the many corners of the globe involved in the former slave trade—and a reminder that many more such corners still exist.","Cape Coast can be reached by car or bus (a tro tro is your best bet) from Accra, Ghana's capital city. Travel time will probably be between three to four hours."

Luckily, they have not been eaten; the reptiles simply hold their souls. In the town of Paga, nestled right up against Burkina Faso, is a sacred crocodile pond where locals believe that crocodiles hold the souls of the village’s deceased. High profile deaths in the community have even coincided with the deaths of some of the sacred crocodiles. Ancestors’ souls or not, the crocodiles of the sacred pond in Paga are protected and allegedly as safe as any domesticated pet. The residents of Paga certainly treat them as such, regularly interacting with the 110 crocodiles in the main crocodile sanctuary, Chief’s Pond. What’s even more stunning, no one has ever been harmed by one of the crocodiles. Young children swim in the pond and Ghanaians along with tourists are invited to touch and practically play with the reptiles. The people of the town wash clothes next to the bumpy ridges of the crocodiles’ jaws without a hint of fear. Even more remarkable than the docile nature of this crocodile population, is how these massive crocodiles made the pond their home. The pond is completely landlocked and apparently the oldest beasts in the water are over 80 years old. Yet here they are, ready and waiting for tourists to feed them live chickens, sit on them, or lift their spiny tails. Crocodiles have been on earth for over 200 million years, even outliving the dinosaurs. And more importantly, their behavior in Paga is without comparison. For the legions of tourists seeking a wild Africa full of the world’s most impressive and dangerous beasts, Paga’s a good start to their journey. A small fee to a local tour guide is required for interpretation and the purchase of the crocodile’s live chicken dinner.",Paga is North of Bolgatonga near the border of Ghana and Burkina Faso.
29,Mole National Park,"West Gonja, Ghana",At Ghana's largest wildlife refuge you feel like you're right in the animals' backyard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mole-national-park,"As you walk around the restaurant and visitor’s center at Mole National Park, you’ll pass by warthogs wandering along on their way, possibly even an elephant that has strayed from the group. At Ghana’s largest wildlife refuge, life is relaxed and no one is in a rush to get anywhere. Mole National Park (pronounced Moh-lay) is located in northwest Ghana, about 90 miles from the major city of Tamale. The grounds are still fairly undeveloped and untouristed due to the park’s remote location, which makes it feel like you are truly wandering around the animals’ backyard. The park was established in 1964, though the land was first set aside as a game reserve in 1958, a year after Ghana’s independence from Britain. The park spans about 3,000 square miles, fed by the seasonal Lovi and Mole rivers. On the grounds there is a motel and pool that look from a cliffside out across the savanna woodland, from which you can watch herds of elephants meandering by the water holes below. The park is home to 90 mammalian species (including five types of primates), 734 species of flower plants, 56 butterfly species, and enough bird species to attract avid birders—at least 300 species, including the white-backed vulture and Senegal parrot. However, because of the few dozen villages located near the park boundaries, subsistence hunting continues to pose a problem for preserving the wildlife. What’s more, the elephants’ former migration route into southern Burkina Faso has been obstructed by human settlement, and seemingly less frequented as a result. You can take jeep safari tours around the park’s rust red dirt roads, and are often able to get right up close to the elephants (there are around 500 total) and possibly pass by antelopes, hippos, hartebeests, buffalo and monkeys. The poor maintenance of the roads—which access only a small fraction of the park—is a loss to visitors, but a gain for the wildlife.","The park is 146km (90 miles) southeast of the major city of Tamale. The best way to get there is a bus, shared car, or van, through which you can likely arrange transport both ways."

It has survived for centuries despite inclement weather and bad reconstruction projects. As the legend goes, Ayuba, a Moorish trader, was traveling across the Sahara in 1421 when he spent the night in the village of Larabanga. He received instructions in a dream to construct a mosque in the village, and when he awoke the foundations had already been set for him. He built the mosque in the traditional Sudanic-Sahelian style, from mud and reeds. Each side of the building bore a separate entrance: one for men, one for women, one for Larabanga’s chief, and one for the muezzin who calls the community to prayer. Ayuba remained in Larabanga for the rest of his life, and when his remains were buried beneath a nearby baobab tree, the leaves were said to have special healing powers. By the 1970s the mosque was badly deteriorated and in need of reconstruction. A reconstruction crew applied cement to the walls in the hopes of strengthening them, but the mixture allowed moisture to penetrate the ancient wooden beams. A termite infestation followed, and a storm toppled the weakened minaret. With support from the World Monuments Fund, the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board, and American Express, the conservators then employed local artisans to fix their mistakes. They carefully removed the cement and reapplied a mud paste much like Ayuba had used 550 years prior. The minaret was rebuilt, the walls were whitewashed, and the mosque was restored to its former glory. Today, perhaps because of the mistakes of the 20th century, the mosque is largely maintained by the local community. They still worship in the ancient building, but they also reap the profits of the many tourists who come to visit the holy site.","If you can, find a man from the village named Ibrahim. He works with the local orphanage and at Mole, and can help you coordinate a visit to the mosque. He is very passionate about his community and wants to share his culture with visitors. The official viewing fee for the mosque is GH¢ 1.00. Non-Muslims are not allowed to enter the mosque."
32,Ga-Adangbe Caskets - Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop,"Accra, Ghana",The clever workshop that has been designing some of the most unusual coffins imaginable.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ga-adangbe-caskets,"When members of the Ga-Adangbe in Ghana die, they move into their next life and affect the living from beyond the grave. To guarantee smooth transfer into the next world, their descendants bury them in elaborate coffins, made to symbolize their lives. In the 1950s, a fisherman from Accra was buried in a fish-shaped coffin. He had made his livelihood from the sea and wanted to move into his next life in a reflection of the being that had supported him. Shortly after the first symbolic fish coffin was built, a number of skilled carpenters popularized the practice around Accra. Seth Kane Kwei, one of the original creators of the coffins, opened the first special workshop dedicated to making the specialized caskets and the trade began to blossom. Coffins range from representations of careers, such as the fish or a taxicab, to more detailed depictions of the deceased habits. Alcohol bottle and cigarette-shaped coffins portraying the vice of the dead is also not unknown. Anything representing the life of the family member is chosen, and serves as the vessel guiding the deceased to their next life. Today, the Ga-Adangbe are well known for their coffins, which often appear bizarre to Western visitors used to solemn funerary rights. Although Ga funerals are still a sad event, the unique coffins allow them to celebrate the life of the deceased and cull favor with their ancestors. Even though many Ga have very low income, they spend massive amounts to buy the specialized coffins, which can cost anywhere from $50 to $600. Kwei’s sons and grandsons are still designing caskets in a quirky variety of shapes. Their creations range from bananas and robots to firetrucks and spoons - whatever most encapsulates the spirit and personality of the loved one.",
33,Black Star Square,"Accra, Ghana",An enormous public square and parade ground built to celebrate Ghana's independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/black-star-square,"In 1957, the Ghanaian politician and revolutionary leader Kwame Nkrumah led the Gold Coast, now Ghana, to its independence from Britain. Nkrumah became the first prime minister and president of Ghana, and to celebrate his nation’s newfound autonomy, he commissioned the construction of a huge public square. Black Star Square, also known as Independence Square, is located in Accra, Ghana, and is now the site for all the major military and civic parades in the Ghanaian capital. It was completed in 1961 to coincide with the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II. The young Queen was keen to keep the unstable African republic within the Commonwealth, and was adamant on making the tour of Ghana despite a spate of bombings that were rocking Accra in protest of Nkrumah’s rule. From the first parades in honor of the Queen’s visit all the way up to the present day, Black Star Square has hosted all of the country’s major national public gatherings, national festivals, military parades, concerts, and occasional fashion shows. None of these are more important than the Independence Day parades held in the square each year on March 6. To accommodate spectators at these events, large stands with a total seating capacity of 30,000 surround the edges of the square. And while these stands and the square itself are packed with people during events, the vast space tends to be all but empty on a typical day, save for a few soldiers and a scattering of tourists who come to see the principal monuments that sit on and around the park. These monuments include the Independence Arch to the south of the square, backdropped by the Gulf of Guinea. On the opposite side of the square but facing the arch is the Memorial of the Unknown Soldier, which honors the Ghanaian soldiers who fell fighting for their country. Just to the north of the main square is a roundabout, in the center of which stands the Black Star Gate, an imposing monument topped by the Black Star of Africa, the five-pointed star that symbolizes Africa in general and Ghana in particular. The monument bears the large inscription “AD 1957” and “Freedom and Justice.” In terms of overall size, there is an oft-repeated claim that Black Star Square is the second largest city square in the world after Tiananmen Square in Beijing. That, however, is wrong on a few counts. Firstly, Tiananmen Square is not the largest square in the world, but does sit comfortably in the top 10. Secondly, Black Star Square has an approximate area of 1,057,238 square feet (98,220 sq meters), and that’s a generous approximation. That could maybe squeeze the square into the world’s top 30 at best, perhaps rivaling Millennium Park in Chicago. And then, of course, there’s the whole definition of city parks, parade grounds etc. Still, it’s fair to say that Black Star Square could well be the largest square of its type in Africa, and that’s no mean achievement.","Black Star Square is located between 28th February Road and Accra's southern coastline. It's always open to the public unless there are ticketed events taking place. Be careful when taking photographs of the square and its monuments. Since 2011, the Independence Arch has been guarded by a handful of soldiers who prohibit people taking close-up photos of the Arch. It's best to always ask permission before taking any photos of monuments on the square, especially if they're being guarded by soldiers."
34,Agbogbloshie,"Accra, Ghana",The world’s largest digital waste dump has become a site where organized criminals hack into confidential government data.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agbogbloshie,"Between 1960 and 1965, the GDP of Ghana increased by nearly 50%. As the country’s economy industrialized, migrants from the rural parts of Ghana flocked to Accra, the largest city in the country, in search of economic relief. The migrants lived in a large slum on the outskirts of Accra called “Old Fadama.” The impoverished neighborhood grew in the 1980s, when another wave of migrants entered the city, fleeing Ghana’s Konkomba-Nanumba War. The residents who settled in Old Fadama were densely packed - up to 20 Ghanaians sleeping in a single 40 square foot kiosk - with little clean water or health services to be found. This neighborhood was much like other deeply poverty-stricken areas - that is, until the early 2000s, when the first ships arrived filled with electronic waste - old computers, cameras, television sets, and everything in between - from the United States, Japan, and Europe. The developed world saw Ghana as a dumping ground for their digital leftovers, as it’s cheaper to send unprocessed e-waste off in bulk to a developing country than it is to actually recycle it. This activity is illegal under the Basel Convention, but the rich nations used the legal loophole of classifying the garbage as “donations” to “bridge the digital divide” between the developed and developing world. Suddenly, a section of Old Fadama was designated as a digital dumping ground, known as “Agbogbloshie.” In the years following the first e-waste, the Korle Lagoon, located inside Agbogbloshie, became one of the most polluted bodies of water on the planet, with levels of toxins 100 times the acceptable amount. At the same time, the young children of Agbogbloshie began to burn the e-waste for trace precious metals, earning them four to six dollars per day, but in the process exposing their young bodies to toxic and carcinogenic substances, causing, among other things, a lead poisoning rate of 80%. Life in Agbogbloshie was so bad that the region was nicknamed “Sodom and Gomorrah” after the two Biblical cities synonymous with harsh living conditions. However there was another valuable asset sitting in this Ghanaian e-dump: secrets. When e-waste is shipped from the United States and other Western countries to Ghana, the data is sometimes not properly overwritten or erased - and even if it is, there are unerasable pieces of data called “bad sectors”, which are unreachable by a computer’s transistors and cannot be overwritten. On certain computers, no matter how hard you try, you can’t completely delete every file that goes to an e-dump. This is a problem, or an opportunity, depending on who you are. Agbogbloshie is filled with hundreds of organized criminals who recover gigabytes of information from the personal computers of ordinary Americans. They can find credit card information, private financial data, and personal memorabilia. The US government even dumps their old electronics in Agbogbloshie, many of which contain classified government documents. Once they are dumped, there is a chance that someone will uncover the secret data, and in fact they have. Organized criminals have uncovered secret multi-million dollar agreements from the Defence Intelligence Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, and the TSA. These are the unintended consequences, besides the lead poisoning, cancer, and general horror, of rich nations treating someone else’s home as their trashcan.",
35,Sword of Okomfo Anokye,"Kumasi, Ghana","On the grounds of a hospital in Ghana, a legendary sword said to have been plunged into the earth hundreds of years ago.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sword-of-okomfo-anokye,"On the grounds of a teaching hospital in south-central Ghana, a legendary sword is buried in the ground. It is said to have belonged to Okomfo Anokye, a leader of the Ashanti people who plunged it into the earth hundreds of years ago. Kwame Frimpong Anokye, popularly known as Okomfo Anokye, was a traditional priest and leader of the Ashanti people of Ghana. He helped establish new laws and customs to help reduce the influence of old traditional customs that were negatively influencing its people. Okomfo, which means priest, was an acquired title as he was believed to possess special abilities of healing and of controlling nature. The sword was used by Okomfo Anokye as a symbol to signify peace and unity among the Ashanti Empire. According to local history, the sword was pushed into the ground over 300 years ago. It is believed that Okomfo Anokye pronounced the sword to be immovable, and so it has remained. This is not due to lack of trying—there have been many attempts, including by well-known figures such as Mohammed Ali, who attempted to remove the sword in 1994. The sword has also attracted much attention over the years and even that of the Queen of England in 1961. The Okomfo Anokye sword site is also home to the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, as the site is said to be a healing ground. It is also home to the famous golden stool of Asantema, where it was said to have descended from.",

The Centre d’Art Acrobatique Keita Fodeba (Keita Fodeba Centre for Acrobatic Arts) in Conakry, Guinea, trains its young students to perform spectacular acrobatic feats that have astounded audiences world over. The center was founded in 1998 and it recruits street children and youth to train in acrobatics and contortionism, and also offers pre-professional training and literacy programs. The institution is a training hub for some of Africa’s greatest contortionists and acrobats. Performers from the school have toured internationally in Europe and North America and have sought to work with Cirque du Soleil and other acts. At any given time, it houses around 50 students, aging between 10 and 20. The school’s work has received acclaim from critics and activists alike, and it has been supported by UNICEF. Visitors are able to come watch the acrobats rehearse in the mornings in their training space near the Dixinn Stadium. The agility and enthusiasm of the young performers make it well worth the visit. Shows are also held in other venues in Conakry.",Hours are approximately 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. but may vary.
37,Tourist Office of Mali-ville,"Mali, Guinea",This small building is a living testament to the remoteness and warmth of the town that it represents.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tourist-office-of-mali-ville-guinea,"No traveller arrives in Mali, a town in the far north of Guinea’s mountainous Fouta Djallon region, without a story to tell. Mali, which is sometimes referred to as Mali-ville to distinguish it from the neighboring country of the same name, is as remote as it is beautiful. The town sits among rolling green mountains that include Guinea’s highest point. Crisp weather and incredibly welcoming people give the area a special feel. There are basically two ways to reach Mali-ville. You could bump over difficult roads in utterly packed transport for several days from Conakry, or hike or motorbike up across barely extant trails from across the Senegalese border. Coming from Senegal takes two days and requires sleeping the night in the forest or, if you’re lucky, in one of the several villages on the way that exist off the road and electricity network. Given the difficult journey, it feels absolutely right and just that the local tourism board maintains an active office to welcome any visitors. The office acts as a food and stationary shop most of the time. But when a visitor arrives, they provide warm welcomes and seem genuinely delighted that someone has come to town. The office has a fascinating board which shows the number of tourists who have arrived in Mali every year since 1999, when only 20 visitors came through. There have been ups and downs since then, with a peak of 1,300, but always this remote Tourist Office has stood by, ready to give them a proper welcome.","It makes sense to come here first when you arrive in Mali. You will be asked to pay a very small per-visitor fee (around 2,000 CFA in 2019) and will get a chance to set up accommodations, tours in the area, or any other service. No addresses are noted in Mali, but any local will be able to point you to the ""Bureau Tourisme."""
