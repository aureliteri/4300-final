0,St. Regis Lhasa Resort Swimming Pool,"Lhasa, Tibet","Described as ""the world's most blinging pool.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-regis-lhasa-resort-swimming-pool,"On top of a hill with incredible views in Tibet and only minutes away from tourism-friendly UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the St. Regis Lhasa Resort is one of the world’s most decadent retreats. Surrounded by the towering Himalayas, the hotel, which is situated on eight acres of land, bills itself as “standing on the roof of the world.” The resort’s 162 guest rooms, villas, and suites - each with either mountain views or a view of the Potala Palace, the museum that formerly housed the Dalai Lama until 1959 - feature high speed Internet access, 24-hour butler service, Bose sound systems, large marble bathrooms, 42-inch plasma televisions, and more. But it’s the swimming pool that really puts this five-star hotel over the top. Described as “the world’s most blinging pool” by the Daily Mail, the pool at the St. Regis Lhasa Resort is plated in gold. “Not content with views of the Himalayas and Tibet’s first ever fine-dining restaurant, the hotel decided luxury wasn’t luxury until its spa looked like something P. Diddy would love to hang around his neck,” the Daily Mail wrote. “And so the swimming pool was lined with thousands of golden tiles.”",places to stay shops architectural oddities architecture
1,Rongbuk Monastery and Guesthouse,"Rikaze Diqu, Tibet",The highest monastery in the world operates a tiny guesthouse with doors open to all.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rongbuk-monastery-and-guesthouse,"At 16,340 feet above sea level, situated near the base of Mount Everest’s north face, nowhere on Earth is it possible to be both physically and spiritually closer to the heavens than at Rongbuk Monastery. Currently home to up to 30 Buddhist monks and nuns in residence, Rongbuk was established in 1909 by Ngawang Tenzin Norbu in its present location. Long known for having meditation huts and caves used by a community of hermetic Buddhist monks and nuns, the monastery is noteworthy for its sprawling grounds containing a main hall with statues of the Buddhist deities Sakyamuni and Padmasambhava, intricate murals, and a prominent chorten containing a reliquary. The first half of the 20th century found Rongbuk booming on religious as well as mountaineering fronts. Once rumored to house 500 devout followers, the monastery gradually expanded to include seven chapels. A modest guesthouse was also added adjacent to the monk and nuns’ quarters for those making briefer spiritual pilgrimages. This addition laid the groundwork for accommodating the ever-increasing number of adventurers drawn to Rongbuk by the tantalizing mountain peaks in its backyard, which continues to this day. Lodging specifications at the monastery’s guesthouse won’t surprise anyone considering it’s being run by reclusive monks at one of the most remote locations in the world. Shared outdoor latrines, tiny rooms, limited heating, and minimal electricity are realities, though most seeking a stay at Rongbuk are doing so for its vantage into the natural and metaphysical, not the tangible.  Accessible by road via a two- to three-hour drive from the Friendship Highway by way of either Shelkar or Old Tingri.",tibet monks buddhism places to stay mountains
2,Drigung Monastery,"Lhasa, Tibet",This Tibetan monastery has survived multiple attacks and is also a sky burial site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drigung-monastery,"Tibetan monasteries with their peaceful and silent atmospheres might seem unlikely candidates for violence and politics, but the Drigung Thil monastery near Lhasa suffered great destruction early in its history before being rebuilt to become the structure seen today. The fortress-like monastery, also called Drikung, was founded by Kyowa Jigten Sumgon in the late 12th century, and his Drigung Kagyu school of teachings soon acquired a huge following. With its increasing popularity and political power came a rivalry with another influential sect, the Sakyas. The Sakyas eventually led a march on the monastery in 1290 and destroyed it. Though its political clout declined, the monastery was rebuilt and is today an important spiritual center, especially known for its meditation techniques. During the Cultural Revolution, the monastery suffered another series of attacks, with many of its statues and manuscripts looted and buildings damaged. The current site overlooks the Shorong valley and contains traditionally decorated temples, prayer halls, and residences for around 250 monks. The monastery is also well-known for its sky burial site, situated at a height of 14,975 feet on the mountaintop. The death ceremonies are performed by the monks every afternoon, and the following morning the bodies are carried to the lofty site, which is surrounded by small stupas and temples. Himalayan vultures are invited to feed on the flesh, and anything that remains is burnt and offered to the sky in another ritual. It is one of the last remaining places in the world where the traditional excarnation ritual is practiced.",monks buddhism death burial places religion sacred spaces
3,Tanggula Railway Station,"Naqu, Tibet","At 16,627 feet above sea level, this unstaffed station is the highest in the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tanggula-railway-station,"The Tanggula Railway Station sits on the vast Tibetan Plateau, a high-altitude landscape beset by permafrost. But despite its bleak isolation, this lonely, unstaffed railway station has a lofty claim to fame: at 16,627 feet above sea level, it’s the highest railway station in the world. The 1,215-mile-long Qingzang Railway runs from Qinghai to Lhasa, passing through many desolate and barely habitable landscapes. It was an astounding feat of construction, and one that had to overcome numerous problems, particularly on the Golmud to Lhasa section where workers had to contend with both extremely high altitudes and permafrost. Upon its completion, however, the railway was rewarded with a handful of world records. It was recognized as being the highest railway in the world, with the world’s highest railway tunnel (the Fenghuoshan Tunnel) and the world’s highest railway station. The Tanggula Railway Station was inaugurated on July 1, 2006, along with the Golmud to Lhasa section of the Qingzang Railway. The platform stretches for more than half a mile, but the station’s facilities are almost as stark as the landscape surrounding it. The station is unstaffed, and while some trains do stop here briefly, passengers normally have to remain on the train. The surrounding area is pretty much uninhabited, and the station serves as a stop-off for repairs or emergencies, with few, if any, passengers actually wanting to disembark at Tanggula. But the view from the station (or from the train as it stops or passes by) is impressive. And less than a mile from the station is the Tanggula Pass, which at 16,640 feet above sea level is the highest point of the Qingzang Railway.  The Qingzang Railway, also known as the Qinghai–Tibet Railway, runs from Xining in the Qinghai Province of China to Lhasa in Tibet. There are 45 stations along the Golmud to Lhasa section, 38 of which are unstaffed. Some stations have “scenic platforms” where passengers can disembark briefly to enjoy the scenery, at least during the day. The Tanggula Railway Station was built partly because of its impressive views, but there’s no guarantee that the train will stop, let alone let people off. Ask in advance about the possibly of disembarking at Tanggula, as some services might be more likely to stop than others.",trains infrastructure transportation
4,The Gates of Hell,Turkmenistan,A fiery crater has been burning in the Karakum Desert since 1971.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-gates-of-hell-turkmenistan,"In the hot, expansive Karakum desert in Turkmenistan, near the 350-person village of Darvaza, is a hole 230 feet wide that has been on fire for over 50 years. Though technically called the Darvaza gas crater, locals know the crater as “The Gates of Hell.” Its fiery glow can be seen for miles around. The Gates of Hell crater was created in 1971 when a Soviet drilling rig accidentally punched into a massive underground natural gas cavern, causing the ground to collapse and the entire drilling rig to fall in. Having punctured a pocket of gas, poisonous fumes began leaking at an alarming rate. To head off a potential environmental catastrophe, the Soviets set the hole alight, figuring it would stop burning within a few weeks. Decades later, and the fiery pit is still going strong. The Soviet drilling rig is believed to still be down there somewhere, on the other side of the “Gates of Hell.” Amazingly, despite the crater’s foreboding name and ever-present flames, people still trek into the desert to witness the site in all its blazing glory. The nearby desert has become a popular place for wild camping. But the fate of the burning crater may be in limbo. In January 2022, President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov ordered the government of Turkmenistan to begin researching how to put the fire out.

5,Köw Ata Underground Lake,"Gokdepe, Turkmenistan",This cavernous swimming spot doubles as a home to the largest known colony of bats in Central Asia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koew-ata-underground-lake,"In Turkmenistan, a sun-scorched Central Asian country where over 80 percent of the land is covered in desert, finding a place to swim can often be a challenge. The landlocked nation has access to the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest lake, but it’s a long way from the capital city of Ashgabat. Most people from the capital region prefer the country’s next best swimming spot—which is located more than 200 feet underground. A long metal staircase leads down into the Bakharden Cave, where the 235-foot-long lake is located. The warm waters contain a high amount of different salts and minerals, most notably sulfur, which is responsible for the distinct smell within the cave. Thus, Köw Ata Underground Lake is also the closest thing Turkmenistan has to a thermal spa. Aside from being a swimming spot and a thermal spa, the cave is also a natural monument, established to protect the largest known colony of bats in the whole of Central Asia. It is a question of personal taste, whether this fact adds to a pleasurable swim or not.  The lake is best visited with your own transportation, and it's about an hour to an hour an a half's drive from Ashgabat. Admission is not free. It's best to bring a change of clothing, so you don't smell like sulfur after visiting the lake.",bat caves bats caves natural wonders ecosystems water nature animals
6,Ancient Merv,"Merv, Turkmenistan",This famed Silk Road oasis was one of the largest cities in the world before it was destroyed by a Mongol horde.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-merv,"One of the most famous cities you’ve (probably) never heard of, Merv served as the capital of a number of empires and kingdoms over the course of its more than 4,000-year-long history. With plentiful water reserves and a supremely strategic location between the Afghan highlands and the Karakum Desert lowlands, Merv was a sought-after geographic prize for Persians, Arabs, Turks, and Greeks alike—including Alexander the Great, who ancient Roman author Pliny the Elder claimed actually first founded the city. Whether or not that’s true, it’s indisputable that Merv was eventually transformed from a simple oasis town into the administrative, commercial, and religious nexus for political dynasties spanning from modern-day Turkey to Central Asia, the Persian Gulf, and beyond. As it changed hands between succeeding empires, Merv’s population swelled to upwards of 500,000 people during the 12th and 13th centuries, making it possibly the third-largest city in the world at the time. That is until Tolui Khan, the fourth son of the notorious conqueror Genghis Khan, and his Mongol army entered the city in 1221. Tolui promptly ordered his soldiers to kill every single one of Merv’s inhabitants, except 400 relatively lucky artisans who were taken prisoner. In all, it’s said the Mongol destruction of Merv left between 700,000 and 1 million people dead, including several hundred thousand refugees that had been seeking shelter nearby and were swept up in the carnage. The attack signaled the end of Merv’s reign as a major Silk Road trading post and prized capital city. Today, however, Merv’s glory shines once again thanks to the efforts of the Turkmenistan government, dedicated academics, and UNESCO, which declared Ancient Merv a World Heritage Site in 1999 (Turkmenistan’s first ever such honor). The resulting efforts have uncovered thousands of years of history once lost to time, including Bronze Age settlements dating back as far as 2500 BC, as well as numerous fortresses, medieval walls, mausoleums, mosques, and more, all in varying stages of preservation. The sheer size of the city and its ruins makes Merv among the most impressive and complex archaeological sites on Earth, delivering a new accolade for the once-renowned world capital.  Merv can be reached in just under one hour (40 km) from the provincial capital, Mary, which is the largest nearby city. There is no public transportation to or from the archaeological park, so travelers must arrange this independently, and considering the vast size of the site, all visitors are advised to have some form of transportation while exploring Merv itself.",silk road oasis ancient archaeology ruins
7,Nokhur Cemetery,"Nokhur, Turkmenistan",A cemetery with goat-horn bedecked gravestones.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nokhur-cemetery,"At the cemetery of the isolated village of Nokhur, nearly every grave is marked by a wooden post adorned with the horns of a mountain goat. The goat horns are thought to fight off evil spirits and help the souls of the deceased to ensure a safe passage to heaven. In addition to their appearances at the village cemetery, skulls of mountain goats are found at some of the houses’ doorways of the village as well. The Nokhuris, the mountain tribe of the region, have always considered mountain goats sacred animals for their strength and endurance. The reverence of mountain goats clearly predates Islamic traditions, and though today the Nokhuris are devout Muslims, this part of their ancient belief system has continued to survive. The cemetery of Nokhur is an excellent example of how Islam works in Central Asia. Other than in the Middle East, where the arrival of Islam virtually erased all traces of pre-Islamic religions, in Central Asia certain parts of pre-Islamic belief systems have been incorporated into the younger religion, creating a syncretism often symbolized in the burial rites of local tribes.  Visitors are discouraged from entering the cemetery. However, you can still admire the horned graves respectfully from outside the fence.",catacombs memento mori rites and rituals catacombs and crypts cemeteries
8,Wedding Palace,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan","If you want to get married in the White Marble City of Ashgabat, you should do it in this surreal disco ball building.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wedding-palace,"The white marble city of Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, is packed to the borders with strange architecture and puzzling statues. One of the most surreal sights in the city is a government building known as the Wedding Palace, which is topped by a massive, geometrically caged disco ball globe. Built in 2011, the Wedding Palace is a civil building, but it looks as though it was created by a wealthy eccentric. The lower floors of the white and gold structure are star-shaped and stacked in a staggered fashion so that their points do not overlap. Atop the initial floors is a huge globe that features gold maps of Turkmenistan. The oversized disco ball is enclosed by a frame of eight-sided Turkmen stars. Inside, the building delivers essentially what its name would suggest, acting as both the office where newlyweds can legally register their union as well as a venue in which to hold the ceremony. There are 11 floors in the complex, all devoted to getting people hitched. The grandest hall in the structure, known as the “Shamchyrag,” is located smack in the middle of the giant globe. Unique to the Wedding Palace, couples who wish to tie the knot in the opulent castle must have their photo taken in front of a portrait of the President of Turkmenistan, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. Who better to feature in the pictures of your special day?  It's possible to visit the palace, but you can also admire its unusual architecture from outside. Stop by to see it at night, when it's lit with colored lights.

9,Yangykala Canyon,"Balkanabat, Turkmenistan","Few people have ever heard of, let alone visited, one of Turkmenistan’s most impressive natural attractions.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yangykala-canyon,"Turkmenistan is one of the most sparsely populated countries in Asia, and one of the least visited in the world. And out in the far west of this often forgotten country lies a natural attraction that few Turkmen have ever even seen: the Yangykala Canyon, a windblown landscape of colorful canyons and strange formations that stretches some 15 miles across the desert to the Garabogazköl Basin. Yangykala was once underwater, the floor of an ancient ocean that existed millions of years ago. Once that ocean had dried, it left behind a rocky landscape that was slowly eroded by wind and rain, cutting out cliffs and canyons whose walls are now ribbed like the carcasses of strange stranded sea creatures. And then there are the colors: pinks and oranges, reds and yellows, a spectrum of coral shades that give Yangykala Canyon a distinct look. It’s sometimes referred to as the “The Grand Canyon of Central Asia,” but the two are very different. Yangykala had no Colorado River to carve its path, so the actual canyon is far less defined than the Grand Canyon. In many places it looks more like a Martian landscape, pockmarked and chaotic—a place where few humans come and where even the camels look almost lost.  Yangykala Canyon is located in the far northwest of Turkmenistan, about 260 miles northwest of the capital, Ashgabat. You can arrange a three-day tour to the canyon from Ashgabat, or visit it as a day trip from Balkanabat, which is about a four-hour drive from the canyon. The roads are in poor condition, so you need to go by 4x4. There’s also very little in the way of infrastructure or services along the way, so tours must take extra water and fuel in case of emergencies. Once you arrive, you’ll likely be taken to a rock formation known as the “Crocodile’s Mouth” from which you’ll have excellent views of the canyon. To fully appreciate the stunning sunset (and sunrise), you can arrange to camp on a plateau above the canyon. Be prepared, however, as it can be extremely windy and very cold at night.",color martian landscapes landscapes natural wonders ecosystems geology nature
10,The Walk of Health,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",This harsh mountain path was built as a strange attempt to improve the health of Turkmen citizens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/walk-of-health,"The Turkmen city of Ashgabat is probably one of the weirdest places on Earth. Much of the capital was the brainchild of the longstanding totalitarian president Saparmurat Niyazov, who has become most famous for the obscure laws he decreed like his ban on dogs, lip-syncing in concerts, and the circus. No less bizarre are the architectural monuments that he built during his 15-year-reign in the capital city, of which the Neutrality Arch is probably the most famous. Another one of the strange creations of Niyazov is the Walk of Health, a concrete stairway that runs alongside the treeless Kopet Dag mountains, aimed to improve the health condition of the citizens. The Walk of Health is actually two walks. The first one has a total length of 8 kilometers, and the other has a total length of 37 kilometers. After it was built, Niyazov ordered all ministers, members of parliament and civil servants to hike the entirety of the longer walk once a year. He also expected the population of the city to do the walk at least once per year as well. Niyazov himself watched his staff start the walk, and later flew in his helicopter to the final stage of the walk to greet them on their successfully completed walk. He argued, that his heart condition would not allow him to do the walk himself. In retrospect, he probably wasn’t lying. He died in 2006 of a heart attack. Despite forcing employees to walk for their health, the forced march was counterproductive. Apparently, walking on a concrete stairway for 22 miles without a source of shade in sight, in one of the more extreme climates on Earth, is a health risk. Ironically, following the annual march, many employees took sick days off of work. To make the walk even slightly plausible, the government has begun to plant trees along the shorter walk.",health trails monuments architectural oddities architecture
11,Turkmenbashi's Land of Fairy Tales,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",An eccentric dictator's take on a Turkmen version of Disneyland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/turkmenbashi-s-land-of-fairy-tales,"Turkmenbashi is the name former dictator of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov, awarded himself when he rose to power following the collapse of the Soviet Union—it literally translates as “Father of the Turkmen.”  For 20 years, Niyazov ruled Turkmenistan with an iron fist, smashing opposition, spending lavishly on personal projects, and creating an elaborate cult of personality. Although Niyazov’s list of eccentricities is long, some of the highlights are his book of poetry, the Rukhnama, that is mandatory reading for all Turkmen students; renaming months of the year after his family members; commissioning a golden statue of himself that rotates to face the sun as it crosses the sky; and bulldozing the homes of hundreds of residents of the capital city, Ashgabat, to build a Turkmen version of Disneyland. Of course, the amusement park was named after himself: Turkmenbashi’s Land of Fairy Tales. The park opened in 2006 at an estimated cost of $50,000,000 and its 54 attractions span some 100 acres (although not all attractions are currently working). While many of the attractions are typical of amusement parks—a Ferris wheel, log ride, small roller coaster, etc.—visitors may begin to notice some odd quirks. There’s a T-rex in a frozen cavern, the deteriorating facade of a fake British Pub, and an island ruled by a giant concrete Gila monster. But even more disconcerting are the animal scenes spread throughout the park. A cobra sticks its lethal head out of the grass, a leopard stalks a pair of deer, two human-sized rabbits with hollowed out faces wait to greet you, and a pack of wolves creeps behind a herd of antelope—you know, kids’ stuff. Turkmenbashi died in December of 2006, shortly after the park opened. Today, visitors rarely find the park at capacity. Instead, the attraction sits listless and decaying, a flat, brown spot in the middle of Ashgabat’s gleaming white marble apartment buildings.  The amusement park is located toward the center of the city. The amusement park is still open, but it's in need of repair.

12,Kyrk Gyz Cave,"Koytendag, Turkmenistan",A cave covered with bizarre stalactites of cloth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyrk-gyz-cave,"In the Köytendag Mountains, a dirt trail leads to the remote Kyrk Gyz Cave. Inside the cave is a something which looks familiar but slowly reveals itself to be bizarre. The ceilings of the cavern is bedecked with a large number of stalactites. However on closer inspection, one can see the stalactites are not stone, but cloth. Local legend has it that anyone who can fling a mud pie with a cloth attached to it to the ceiling of the cave and make it stick, walks away with a wish granted. Kyrk Gyz Cave means “Forty Girls’ Cave”, a name that refers to a local legend of forty girls who once retreated there, in order to avoid rape and murder by bandits. Once in the cave, the forty girls were fed by a mysterious old woman, whose tomb is said to be located in front of the cave. When the bandits discovered them, the Girls prayed to the Gods, who showed them an escape route through the caverns. What that story has to do with placing mud-soaked cloth stripes to the ceiling of the cave however, remains unclear.",cultures and civilizations rites and rituals caves ecosystems sacred spaces
13,Arch of Neutrality,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",A dictator's gold statue once rotated to face the sun on a 75-meter high marble tower.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arch-of-neutrality,"While the dictator Saparmurat Niyazov banned gold teeth because they offended him, he adored gold statues of himself. As the ruler of Turkmenistan for over two decades, he gilded the country with his own image in a cult of personality that made Mao look modest. The centerpiece was erected in the capital city of Ashgabat. Called the Arch of Neutrality, it was a 75-meter-high rocket-shaped tower topped with a gold statue of Niyazov, which rotated throughout the day so that his face is always basking in the sun. Built in 1998, the marble-covered monument honored his adoption of neutrality as his official policy, and cost over $12 million to create. Niyazov pronounced himself Turkmenbashi, or “Father of All Turkmen,” and “President for Life.” He exerted extensive control over the country, from defining the age at which a person becomes old to forbidding TV presenters from wearing makeup, as he was having trouble telling the men apart from the women. Despite the country having the world’s fourth-largest gas reserves, its five million people lived mostly destitute, while he constructed more and more lavish monuments. One was the colossal statue of the Ruhnama, the rambling, semi-autobiographical philosophical text Niyazov wrote and made required reading for students and anyone taking the driving test. Not content with a ubiquitous image, he renamed the days of the week, months of the year, a meteorite, a moon crater, a breed of horse, airports, a canal, and a city after himself and members of his family. He even changed the Turkmen word for bread to his late mother’s name (Gurbansoltan). His increasingly personal laws included banning beards, long hair, opera, ballet, and circuses, and made it illegal to play recorded music at weddings. No dissent was tolerated under his authoritarian regime, with human rights groups reporting torture, detentions, house demolitions, forced labor, and exile. In 2006, Niyazov died of heart failure. His successor, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, declared in January 2010 that the Arch of Neutrality would be removed and reassembled on the outskirts of Ashgabat. However, it was not until August of 2010 that the statue was finally removed and reassembled on the outskirts of Ashgabat, surrounded by a huge park. The monument is still open to visitors, who can buy tickets for the elevators into the monument to enjoy city views.",monuments statues
14,Saparmurat Hajji Mosque,"Gokdepe, Turkmenistan",A memorial to the thousands of Turkmen soldiers and civilians who died in a bloody 1881 battle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saparmurat-hajji-mosque,"By 1880, Russia’s calculated, wide-sweeping campaign to conquer Central Asia was nearly complete. One of the last barriers to total domination of the region, however, were the Turkmen (or Tekke Turkomans), a loose confederation of tribes and soldiers without an organized, singular state. Imperial Russia had tried to conquer what is now known as modern-day Turkmenistan a year earlier, launching an attack on the strategically located Goek Tepe fortress, where some 15,000 Turkmen soldiers and 5,000 women and children were positioned. The Russians, who were badly outnumbered, poorly managed, and ill-equipped, soon retreated. Russian forces returned two years later with approximately 6,000 soldiers and a new general commanding the attack. While the Turkmen still greatly outnumbered the Russians, the foreign forces broke through after a 23-day siege by digging a tunnel under one of the fortress’s stone walls and detonating a mine, breaching the defensive lines. The Turkmen were forced to flee and by the time the battle was over, nearly 15,000 Turkmen soldiers and civilians were killed. The Saparmurat Hajji Mosque was built on the orders of the first President of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Atayevich Niyazov, on the site of the former Geok Tepe fortress to commemorate the Turkmen lives lost in this tragic battle—and, in typical post-Soviet authoritarian fashion, to honor Niyazov’s own pilgrimage to Mecca. The mosque subsequently became something of a national symbol for the country’s struggles and adorned the reverse of one of Turkmenistan’s 10,000 manat notes until a new series of currency was introduced in 2005.  The Saparmurat Hajji Mosque is located approximately 20 miles from Ashgabat, Turkmenistan's capital city. While open to the public, the mosque seems to receive very few visitors and is not used as a regular, everyday place of worship. A museum dedicated to the Battle of Geok Tepe is located on the mosque grounds, with entrance costing $5 USD per foreigner.",mosques military history religion memorials military sacred spaces museums
15,Independence Monument of Turkmenistan,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",Sumptous memorial to a controversial independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/independence-monument-of-turkmenistan,"The Independence Monument of Turkmenistan is one of the largest and most extravagant of its kind in the entire world. Covering an area of more than 80,000 m², the monument sits in the middle of a landscaped park, with numerous water fountains and pools. Considering its extravagance, many visitors forget that it is situated in a city and surrounding region prone to water shortage. 27 comically looking statues of Turkmen heroes surround the centrepiece of the monument and the golden statue of Turkmenistan’s long-running dictator Niyazov, stands proudly in front of what appears to be a dome, with a minaret-like tower rising from its top. The tower is also adorned in gold and features a viewing platform at its top, as well as the oddly-named Museum of Turkmen Values (which is not much else, but a meagre and extremely overpriced ethnographical collection) within the dome below. But what exactly is so excessively celebrated with the monument remains unclear. It depicts the country’s independence as a huge effort, after a hard struggle to finally break free. However many feel that in reality, Turkmenistan was not at all that eager to gain independence when the Soviet Union collapsed. Niyazov (who was already in charge prior to the collapse of the USSR) at first strongly opposed a dissolution of the USSR, and promoted a reformed Soviet Union rather than a large number of independent states. Just when it was obvious that the Soviet Union had come to an end, Niyazov turned 180 degrees, and in an attempt to keep control over politics in Turkmenistan, before being washed away by a revolution, hastily declared the independence of the country. Independence was proclaimed only two months before the final curtain fell for the Soviet Union. The oversized monument seems to proudly memorize a hard-fought independence with Niyazov at the center of the monument and seemingly the Turkmen independence movement, when in fact, he had tried to prevent the country’s independence until he had no other choice.

16,Giant Ruhnama,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",A huge monument to a bizarre book written by Turkmenistan’s longstanding dictator.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giant-ruhnama,"The former president of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov, is probably best known for his strange laws, banning everything from lip-syncing to smelly dogs in the capital city. Yet few people know that Niyazov is also a published author, and created a bizarre work known as “the Ruhnama.” The Ruhnama is something of a manifestation of the personality cult of the longstanding Turkmen president. He wrote the Ruhnama (The Book of the Soul) in 2001 as a spiritual guide for the Turkmen nation, and as an attempt to “Turkmenize” the country. The Ruhnama features a weird combination of revisionist history, moral ideals, religious norms, and fairytales. The first volume was issued in 2001, and a second volume was published three years later. Niyazov ordered that reading the book was mandatory at all schools and universities, and that all new government employees should be tested on the book’s contents. He later even made a test on the Ruhnama an essential element of driving tests. Niyazov was once quoted saying, that God himself told him that everyone who has read the book would come directly to heaven. Often compared to Gaddafi’s infamous Green Book in Libya. Since its publishing, the Ruhnama has largely been met with amusement outside the country. Generally seen as an excellent example of the weird, totalist nature of Turkmenistan’s regime, the book shows the country’s bizarre closeness between the state and the head of state. Even Niyazov’s death in 2006, has not put a damper on the popularity of the book in the regime, and Niyazov’s successor still regards the Ruhnama as an essential part of Turkmen heritage. Despite its strange nature, the book has been translated into several languages, mostly sponsored by foreign companies that received large-scale contracts in return. The Giant Ruhnama is but one of the many weird outcomes of the personality cult of Niyazov, which has turned Ashgabat into one of the most politically bizarre places on Earth, adorned with golden statues of the dictator and freed of all “non-Turkmen“ elements, such as theaters. As of now, Niyazov is the only author self-conscious enough to have created a giant monument to his fictitious work.  Ashgabat, Ahal Welayaty, Turkmenistan",giant politics books monuments

In its heyday, Dekhistan was a prosperous and strategically located urban center along a caravan route between the ancient realms of Khoresm, an oasis region in Central Asia, and Hyrcania, located southeast of the Caspian Sea in present-day Iran. Dekhistan is believed to have risen in the late 8th century to early 9th century, and comprised nearly 500 acres of fortressed land divided into an old town and a trading and residential district. The capital city of Misrian thrived under the Khwarazmian dynasty, and was notably the site of a medieval mosque with two 80-foot minarets, constructed between the 10th and 12th centuries. The city declined due to the collapse of its advanced irrigation system after extensive deforestation, in conjunction with an invasion by the leader of the Mongol Empire, Genghis Khan. By the 15th century, Dekhistan was completely deserted, and most of the city has been blanketed by sand. The valley has since become arid and infertile, and Dekhistan is now in one of Turkmenistan’s harshest regions. All that remains within the ruins of the city walls are the great mosque’s minarets and portal, as well as bits of former mausoleums and caravanserais.  Tours to the Dekhistan ruins are available for booking through private tour companies.",silk road mausoleums mosques deserts medieval archaeology ruins history
18,Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",The controversial final resting place of the equally controversial first president of Turkmenistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/turkmenbasy-ruhy-mosque,"The Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque was built by Saparmurat Niyazov, the thoroughly peculiar first president of Turkmenistan. Unlike most mosques, the walls of Türkmenbaşy Ruhy are inscribed, controversially, with scriptures from not only the Quran but also the Ruhnama, Niyazov’s own spiritual guide to life. During the last half-century, few presidents have come close to the sheer weirdness of Niyazov, a repressive dictator who ruled over the sparsely populated country from 1985 until his death in 2006. The leader foisted a long list of bizarre decrees upon his country, including banning lip syncing at public concerts, banishing dogs from the capital city, Ashgabat (citing their “unappealing odor”), and outlawing opera, ballet, and circuses because they were “decidedly unturkmen-like.” He also supposedly banned beards, the use of makeup by television presenters, and gold teeth (he recommended that his people chew on bones instead). Oh, and apparently he did away with the Turkmen word for bread and renamed it gurbansoltan, after his mother. So, yes, Saparmurat Niyazov was eccentric. He was also semi-illiterate, but that didn’t stop him writing a new spiritual guide and a kind of origin story for Turkmenistan. The booked was called the Ruhnama (The Book of the Soul), and it was a rambling mess full of dubious claims. Still, many of his countrymen—89 percent of them being Muslim—ended up reading the Ruhnama, simply because they didn’t have much choice in the matter. Niyazov had copies placed in every school and library across the nation. He made reading it a compulsory part of the national driving test and required reading in schools and universities. Then in 2006, despite earlier claiming it was not a religious text, Niyazov explained how he had talked to God and could now confirm that anyone who read the Ruhnama three times would be guaranteed a place in heaven. Niyazov was obsessed with his book (there’s a giant statue of it in Ashgabat), so much so that he elevated it to the same level as the Quran when he built the Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque—the largest mosque in Central Asia—in 2004. The vast prayer room can hold 10,000 pilgrims, with 7,000 men on the main floor and 3,000 women on the second level. Beneath the mosque is an underground parking area with a capacity for 400 cars. The walls of the mosque were inscribed with verses from both the Quran and the Ruhnama. This, unsurprisingly, outraged many Muslims, who believed that passages from the Quran should be given far more reverence than Niyazov’s modern book of rambling moral guidance, and should not appear alongside each other. Even more incendiary was one particular quotation inscribed prominently on the entry arch to the mosque, which reads “The Ruhnama is the holiest book and the Quran is the book of Allah.” Saparmurat Niyazov, however, wasn’t the kind of person who paid much attention to the trifling complaints of the world’s religious leaders. He left his mosque as it was, resplendent in Italian marble and gold, along with the nearby mausoleum, which is a miniature version of the mosque, built in preparation of his own death. He died in 2006, two years after the mosque was built, and now rests in his mausoleum, surrounded by the words of the Quran and his own hallowed Ruhnama.  The Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque (also known as the Gypjak Mosque) is located just off the M37 highway in the village of Gypjak—Saparmurat Niyazov’s hometown—which lies about 7 miles northwest of Ashgabat city center. It’s also not far from Ashgabat International Airport. The mausoleum is guarded by soldiers and is rarely open to the public.",mausoleums mosques presidents books religion sacred spaces
19,Shah-i-Zinda Necropolis,"Samarkand, Uzbekistan",The Avenue of Mausolea is a series of grand palatial tombs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shah-i-zinda-necropolis,"Shah-I-Zinda is one of the oldest and longest-running examples of a continually constructed historic site in the world. It was established with a single religious monument over 1,000 years ago.  Various temples, mausoleums, and buildings were continually added throughout the ensuing centuries, from approximately the 11th century to the 19th. The result is a fascinating cross-reference of various architectural styles, methods, and decorative craftsmanship as they have changed throughout a millennium of work. The complex was founded to mark a site of legend, where mythology states Muhammed’s cousin, Kusam ibn Abbas, was buried. Like most legends, the story has persevered through time, but it is more rare for such historic sites to have endured as long, through centuries of war and weather, progress and expansion. It may in fact be the extensive additions and re-imaginings that have kept the site sacred and respected. That, and the fact that Shah-I-Zinda is a necropolis, housing the remains of numerous people, both famous and unknown, has allowed the various constructions to remain intact for so long. This respect for the existing structures and the continual improvement of the buildings has lead to an interesting multi-tiered design, where layers of history and architecture intertwine between staircases, archways, and dusty paths. One century intersects with another over the course of mere steps at Shah-I-Zinda. Its combination of hallowed ground and continual improvement has allowed this ever-expanding complex to remain fresh and vibrant in the eyes of both citizens and government, allowing it to be preserved and protected throughout the years.",memento mori catacombs and crypts monuments sacred spaces ruins architectural oddities architecture
20,Moynaq,"Muynak District, Uzbekistan","Once a bustling fishing port, this semi-ghost town is now more than 90 miles away from the shore.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moynaq-ghost-town-desert,"Moynaq is a city, surrounded by the desert of western Uzbekistan. At first glance, this seems to be one of the many Soviet cities that fell into decline after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But upon closer inspection, one can’t help but notice that there is something strange about Moynaq. All over the city, displays of fish can be seen on murals, mosaics, posters bleached from the sun, and even on the entrance sign of the city. A monument of a fishing boat sits in front of the government building and a number of closed fish cannery factories dot the landscape - but there is not a single body of water in sight. Moynaq was indeed once an important fishing town, but the water the city was once located on receded a long time ago. It was the ecological disaster of the Aral Sea, which turned this fishing port into a sunbaked town surrounded by the desert. The shrinking of the Aral Sea is considered one of the most severe anthropogenic ecological disasters of all time. Once one of the world’s four largest lakes, the Aral Sea has shrunk to 10 % of its former size since the 1960s. No other city around the Aral Sea was affected by this disaster more severely than Moynaq. The water’s edge is now more than 150km away from the city, and the former fishing fleet of Moynaq sits in a surreal setting in the middle of the desert. It is a bizarre, almost post-apocalyptic experience to view Bactrian camels roam around the rusting ships. When the lake began to recede, the fisherman at first followed the water’s edge, but after a while, the rising salinity levels of the shrinking lake killed off the entire fish population. The ships were simply left in the middle of the desert. Since then, several ships have been collected from the desert and now rest in a “cemetery of ships” at the edge of town. Since fishing was no longer a source of income for the city, the population began to constantly decline for more than three decades. For the last 10 years, oil and gas has been found in the old sea bed of the Aral Sea, and lots of drilling rigs now occupy the empty desert around Moynaq. Nowadays, the town seems to be more alive, with lots of new constructions and buildings in the main street. Most of the remaining population is involved in the cotton industry of the larger region which, ironically, was responsible for the Aral Sea disaster in the first place. The disaster of the Aral Sea could easily be undone, if the rivers that once fed the sea – most notably the Amu Darya river – were no longer diverted to irrigate the cotton fields. Alas, since the economy of Uzbekistan is rather weak, and alternative sources of income in the poor west of the country are not available, a refilling of the Aral Sea seems highly unlikely.",object cemeteries ship graveyards disaster areas cultures and civilizations ships ghost towns ruins
21,Ulugh Beg Observatory,"Samarkand, Uzbekistan",Light still pours into the ruins of this ancient Islamic observatory.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ulugh-beg-observatory,"For nearly half a millennium, the remains of one of the greatest observatories ever built lay hidden in Central Asia. A product of one Muslim prince’s devotion to science, the observatory was the site of the world’s most advanced astronomical studies for three decades before being leveled by religious extremists. Located near the city of Samarkand in present-day Uzbekistan, Ulugh Beg Observatory was built in the 1420s by the Timurid ruler Ulugh Beg, grandson of emperor Timur the Lame (Tamerlane). Known more for his scholarly pursuits than his governance skills, Beg proved unpopular as a ruler. Beg first took control of Transoxiana (a region comprised mostly of modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and southwest Kazakhstan) after his father’s death in 1447. Only two years into his campaign, and after losing several battles to neighboring rival kingdoms, Beg was taken to trial by his own son, Abd al Latif. Beg’s punishment for his ineptitude was a mandatory pilgrimage to Mecca, but his journey ended quickly, as he was beheaded just outside of Samarkand by an assassin hired by his son. Following his death, Beg’s observatory was razed to the ground, and the dozens of skilled scientists who worked there were driven away. For centuries, the site fell into relative obscurity, and the exact location of the observatory was known by few. In 1908, however, the Russian archaeologist Vassily Vyatkin uncovered the remains and with it a rich tale of the ancient astronomer’s work. (Today Vyatkin is buried on site according to his own wishes.) In its prime, the Ulugh Beg Observatory consisted of a three-story cylindrical building constructed around three enormous astronomical instruments. The main instrument, which remains mostly intact, was a monumental meridian arc, now called the Fakhrī sextant. This curving stone arch once measured 40 meters tall and was used by astronomers to measure the angle of elevation of bright celestial objects. Light would pour in through a window and fall on a specific point on the arch that depended on the height of the object in the sky. With this instrument, Beg and his fellow astronomers could precisely determine the length of the year, the time of local noon each day, and even the angle between Earth’s rotational axis and the plane of its orbit around the sun. In fact, the astronomers of Ulugh Beg Observatory measured the length of the year to within 25 seconds of the actual value, and determined the axial tilt of the Earth so accurately that their number falls within today’s accepted range of values. They were able to accomplish what they did because the meridian arc was the largest instrument of its kind ever built. With such great size, the meridian arc could achieve a resolution of one six-hundredth of a degree, which is equivalent to the size of an American penny viewed over a half a kilometer away. Perhaps Ulugh Beg’s greatest achievement, though, was a star catalogue containing at least 1,018 stars and their locations in the night sky. Compiled almost 200 years before the advent of telescopes, the remarkably thorough catalog almost perished with the observatory, but escaped into the hands of astronomer Ali-Kushji, who went on to publish the great work.",abandoned observatories astounding timepieces observatories retro-tech instruments of science subterranean sites ruins
22,Walls of Itchan Kala,"Xiva, Uzbekistan",Ancient barriers wrap around what was once an important stop along the Silk Road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/walls-of-itchan-kala,"Located in the city of Khiva, Itchan Kala (also spelled Ichan Qa’la) was an important stepping stone along the Silk Road. Coming from the West, it was the last place for caravans to stock up before tackling the desert. Like most cities in the region, the original settlement consisted of an inner and an outer part. Incha Qala was the inner, fortified section of this city. With such a steady stream of visitors, it’s hardly surprising to find that the fortified walls were built to stretch upwards of more than 30 feet high. The oldest section of the barrier, which was built using mud bricks, dates back to the fifth century. The walls once featured four gates that faced the four directions. The crenellated wall is punctuated with semicircular towers and together they create mesmerizing wave patterns that have captured the imagination of artists through the years. The beautiful walls aren’t the fortified city’s only treasure. As testimony to the geopolitical importance it once had, Ichan Kala is an impressive sight to behold. Its history goes back millennia, but the buildings remaining standing are mainly from the beginning of the 19th century. In all, there are 51 monuments and 250 buildings nestled within its walls. Among the highlights are Djuma Mosque (also the oldest structure in Ichan Kala), Oq Mosque, Alla-Kulli-Khan madrasah, Pahlavol Mahmoud Mausoleum, and various caravanserais and bazaars, all exquisite examples of ancient Central Asian Islamic architecture. Being a frontier city, ancient Khiva achieved a respectable degree of notoriety, with marauders and slave traders coming and going all year round. If by the beginning of the 20th century, Khiva’s fame began fading, the advent of the Soviet regime delivered the coup-de-grace. Martial surveillance ensured that no lawless activities would be carried out. So much so that the city was all but forgotten, and so was Ichan Kala. Today, people in Khiva look at Ichan Kala as a beacon from a grandiose past from which they all derive.  Most people arrive at the regional capital of Urgench via train, plane, or bus. From there, you can take a taxi to Khiva (it’s about a 40-minute drive). Be prepared to negotiate the price of the ride. Itchan Kala is relatively small and is easily walkable. You can wander within the old city at any time. Some of the higher vantage points offer breathtaking views of the sunset.",walls unesco urban planning cities

Nicknamed the “Tower of Death,” the 48-meter baked-brick tower was constructed in 1127 to call the Muslim faithful in the city to prayer five times a day. With an ornate gallery at its top, and glazed designs etched into the exterior, the tower was known for its impressive dimensions and its artistry. When Genghis Khan arrived around 100 years after the minaret’s construction, local legend has it that Khan looked from the base of the spire to the top, and the steep angle caused his hat to fall off. Admiring the audacity of the tower, Khan ordered the spire spared from the destruction that his army visited on the rest of the city. In the 16th century, the Kaylan mosque and Mir-i Arab Madrasah were built around it, and it is now the center piece of the Po-I Kalyan mosque complex. The tower has been used as an observatory, and, during times of war, it served as a lookout to watch for invading armies. Its most famous, and startlingly recent, use was for public execution, where those condemned to die were thrown from the rotunda at the top to the stone courtyard below. The last known execution took place as late as 1920, during the Russian Revolution.",execution towers ruins

It probably looks a little like hazard-suited Soviets, tinkering with terrifying diseases we long thought were extinct. And that probably looks a lot like Vozrozhdeniye Island just a few decades ago. In 1948, the Soviets opened up a tiny laboratory on the island in the Aral Sea. Before the Aral Sea began to disappear, top-secret work was conducted by teams of scientists researching the weaponization of some of the most deadly diseases humankind has ever known. Over the next 40 years, the Soviets conducted open air tests on smallpox, anthrax and the bubonic plague on the island, hoping its isolation would keep the deadly illnesses from escaping. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the island facility was abandoned, and the remnants of the weaponized diseases were buried quickly. As the island slowly became desert and the sea slowly disappeared due to Soviet irrigation projects, the once isolated island became a part of the mainland. Over concerns that deadly pathogens could still be alive on the island, a team of Russians went to the once active facility site to decontaminate the land. According to their report in 2001, everything was clear. However, a conflicting report in 2005 showed that there were still remnants of the facility including test tubes for conducting experiments on animals, which preserved the chance of deadly diseases such as anthrax still being present in the area.

Visitors will find, as one knowledgeable about such things might expect to, a high portal in the middle of the complex, four minarets, a large entrance, and other distinctive elements. This palace once served as the seventh home of the last ruler of Kokand Khanate, Khudoyar Khan. Khudoyar Khan was, according to historical records, the last Khan of 29 to serve in Kokand within just 150 years. He took the throne in 1845 when he was 12 years old and became the brother-in-law of Mingboshi Musulmonkul, a powerful military leader. Surrounded by a large carved stone wall, Khan’s Palace consists of 119 rooms organized around seven small courtyards. All together, the palace takes up four acres. Building such an enormous complex required 16,000 people and 80 masters in various fields. Those workers used 1,000 carts to haul materials around the complex as they worked on building the structure. None of them, however, wanted to be there; the people were driven to the area by force and made to work in unbearably harsh conditions. Today, the palace serves as a museum of local history, with exhibits detailing the past and present of the surrounding region, Kokand. Kokand is one of the ancient cities of the Fergana Valley in Central Asia.

Dotting the vast desert of what was once ancient Khwarezm are the ruins of countless forts and towns collectively known as the Golden Ring. Less officially but more descriptively, the area is known as Elliq-Qala, which translates literally to “Fifty Forts.” Though only 20 distinct ruin sites have been found to date, this nickname may prove prescient, as new ruins are being discovered (and rediscovered) all the time. And even though the ruins technically do not yet live up to the promise of their name, they still combine to make the area of Khwarezm one of the largest and most fascinating areas of ruin on the planet. More than two millennia ago, people were drawn to Khwarezm for much the same reason they are today – it’s a natural oasis in a region of stark desert, feeding from the Aral Sea and providing a more temperate climate and robust vegetation patterns. For this reason, numerous competing tribes built cities and surrounded them with forts for protection in the area. Visiting Khwarezm today, all that remains of many sites are the foundations of city walls and buildings, only hinting at the larger structures they once formed and protected. Ramparts, basements, and collapsed underground tunnels leading from city to city, or city to fort, are still being unearthed, meaning Elliq-Qala is one of the more exciting archeological sites of the current era. Although the Golden Ring of ruins are now deserted, with modern Khwarezm settlements located a fair distance away, one can only imagine how bustling the now-empty desert once was with trade and war, travelers and settlers, while examining their society’s dusty remnants.",cultures and civilizations ruins

Towers of Silence, also called dakhma, are a traditional excarnation ritual practiced in the Zoroastrian faith dating back thousands of years. Zoroastrians believed that after death a body was at risk of becoming contaminated and made impure by demons. To prevent this, corpses of the deceased were left atop a tower exposed to the elements and birds of prey which would purify the body, after which the bones would be placed in ossuaries nearby. This practice was believed to be the least harmful form of interment. The ancient Chilpik dakhma, a 49-foot-tall circular structure situated on top of a mound of sand rising out of the desert, has become a popular symbol in Karakalpakstan, and even is even found on its coat of arms. This dakhma is particularly significant as local legend suggests the region around it is where Zarathushtra, the founder of Zoroastrianism, began to compose the religion’s ancient scriptures, the Avesta. The Chilpik Tower of Silence remained in full use until the Arab invasion of Khwarezm in the 7th century, and possibly up until 10th century. After burials ceased to be performed, the structure was used as a signal tower.",funeral death ancient religion sacred spaces

This is not the only place that claims to be the final resting place of Daniel. The most widely accepted of these places is in Susa, Iran. Even beyond Uzbekistan and Iran, a couple of cities in Iraq also lay claim to be the final resting place of Daniel – which, since the Bible places Daniel in Babylon, in modern day Iraq, at the time of his death, is not too far-fetched either. Samarkand seems to be the odd one among the places, that argue to be the real final resting place of Daniel. As legend has it, Timur (Tamerlane) tried to conquer modern day Syria, but successively failed – apparently because the body of Daniel was preventing his success. When he finally succeeded, it is claimed, that he ordered the body to be buried at Samarkand for good luck. Immediately after he was buried, a natural spring started to sprout, which, naturally, is regarded to have healing powers. But local lore goes even further, stating that the body of Daniel was continually growing at a rate of around 5cm a year. If this was true, the body of Daniel would by now have a length of more than 125m, rather than “just“ 18m, since he died approximately 2500 years ago. However the truth behind the corpse’s growth is that Timur was paranoid about grave robbers and extended the grave to make it harder for potential robbers to pillage the bones.",relics and reliquaries memento mori sacred spaces

For this reason and others, most governments have avoided creating enclaves - or have avoided allowing them to exist - and there are a relatively small number today. Many of them are found in the Fergana Valley, a region in Central Asia where Taikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan all meet. Just some of the enclaves found in this region include Barak, a small Kyrgyz village surrounded by Uzbekistan; So’x and Shohimardon and the two tiny territories of Qal’acha and Khalmion, all surrounded by Kyrgyzstan; the Tajik village of Sarvan in Uzbekistan; and the Tajik village of Vorukh and the tiny piece of land known as Kairagach, both in Kyrgyzstan. Most of these are just tiny villages with small populations - most have less than 1,000 people - but they have survived because those populations consider it important to maintain their cultural heritage and insist on teaching the traditions of their ancestors. The valley’s history stretches back more than 2,300 years, when the population settled there was first conquered by Greco-Bactrian invaders from the west. As a spot along the Northern Silk Road, this area was converted by Muslim invaders from the west before the Russian Empire took the valley at the end of the 19th century, adding it to the Soviet Union. The three regional states mentioned earlier all gained independent from the Soviet Union in 1991 and the residents have been struggling with cultural conflict ever since. Many of the enclaves don’t even subsist using the same methods. This area is incredibly fertile and diverse, with cotton cultivation playing a large role in the local economy as well as leatherwork, stock breeding, and mining.

Typical plov consists of rice, carrots, and meat cooked together, but every corner of Uzbekistan makes its own version and claims to have the best one. Not only is plov an important source of nourishment for the Uzbeks, but it also represents hospitality, community, and identity; it’s not uncommon to see it served at weddings or festivals. At large gatherings, plov chefs, called osphaz, can prepare a giant meal for up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron (kazan). The menu at the Plov Center is simple; there’s plov, salad, and drinks. Customers get to choose how much rice, how much meat, and whether or not they’d like an egg or kazy (horse sausage, similar to Kazakh shuzhuk). Each batch is cooked in a giant, wood-fired kazan, then scooped onto customers’ plates in the cavernous dining hall. A few tourists have started to find their way to Plov Center, but it’s still an institution dedicated to a dish that is as Uzbek as it can be.

It was the grim finale to years of torture (for Stoddart - four years) in the Zindon prison located within the fortress. However, the most famous resident of Zindon was not a person, but a place: “the Bug Pit,” a four meter deep hole, accessible only by rope. This bleak pit is where Connolly and Stoddart spent their time in Zindon, while guards poured scorpions, bugs, and rodents onto their heads. Stoddart suffered three years in the prison – more than one of which he whiled away in the Bug Pit - before Conolly was thrown down to join him; ironically, Conolly had the unfortunate fate of being sent to Bukhara to release Stoddart. They spent a year together in the Bug Pit, before the Emir finally had them executed. The soldiers were victims of what can only be described as extreme blunders of sociopolitical etiquette. Stoddart was tasked with delivering a letter of reassurance to the Emir of Bukhara, stating that the British had no intention of continuing their invasion of Afghanistan into his kingdom. However, Stoddart had ridden into the castle on horseback rather than walking, and arrived without a gift for Nasrullah Khan, the Emir and an extremely brutal figure. Nicknamed “The Butcher,” Nasrullah was outraged at these indignities, and viewed the British Empire as a weakened nation after their defeat in Afghanistan.  Regarding the two Brits as worthless, he had them jailed, tortured, and executed. The British Empire did not respond. Today, the Bug Pit is but one of many gruesome places in the Zindon prison, in which mannequins eerily portray the conditions of imprisonment.

Such is the case with Uzbekistan. One of two doubly landlocked countries in the world – a landlocked country surrounded entirely landlocked countries, the other being Liechtenstein – Uzbekistan as a national idea did not exist until the Soviets created it in the 1920s, complicating the process of state formation in Uzbekistan today. (The soviets were also responsible for environmental disaster within Uzbekistan such as the draining of the Aral Sea.) Uzbekistan officially came into existence in 1991, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, and holds within its borders a mix of ethnic groups, including Uzbeks, Russians, Tajiks, Kazakhs, Karakalpaks and Tatars. In order to help unify the diverse population held together by its soviet created borders the new Uzbek state looked to pre-Russian Central Asian past for unifying national myths, in order to encourage a cohesive Uzbek identity. The figure that emerged out of this search through Central Asian history was the highly controversial figure of Amir Temur (Tamerlane). A fourteenth-century conqueror of Western, South and Central Asia, Amir Temur’s main qualifications was that his huge empire was located in the modern Uzbek state. He founded the Timurid Empire and Timurid dynasty (1370–1405) in Central Asia. Central Asia blossomed economically and culturally under his reign. At the same time, Baghdad, Damascus, Delhi and other Arab, Persian, Indian and Turkic cities were sacked and destroyed. Ironically, the unifying figure of Uzbekistan wasn’t Uzbek at all and instead belonged to the Barlas, a Turko-Mongolian tribe. In fact, it was the fall of the Timurids that allowed the Uzbek Khaqanate to gain power and form the basis of modern Uzbeks. Nonetheless, Timur has been officially recognized as a national hero of Uzbekistan, because his imperial capital was located in Samarkand. His name has replaced Marx’s and Lenin’s on street signs and government buildings all over Uzbekistan. Opened in 2006, the Amir Timur Museum is one of the newest museums in Tashkent. It was established to commemorate the 660th birthday of Amir Timur. The museum’s blue dome and ornate interior reference Central Asian Islamic architecture. The museum collection consists of ancient manuscripts, paintings, and engravings of Timurid’s age. The collection also includes a 14th century Quran from Syria. Amir Timur’s military career is reconstructed in a celebratory manner. The gardens surrounding the museum contain a statue of Timur on horseback and some prominent fountains. Lingering Soviet influence is acutely felt in the Amir Temur museum. Murals reminiscent of social realism decorate the lobby of the museum. The museum also features an exhibit on president Islam Karimov. Karimov came to power under the Soviet regime and has had a firm grip on the presidency since 1990.

33,Seattle Peace Park,"Tashkent, Uzbekistan",Touching displays of wishes for peace from the Cold War era.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seattle-peace-park,"In retrospect, one could argue that during the Cold War era, the world was much easier to comprehend than it is today. Today, the borders between friend and enemy are blurred, wars are no longer restricted to political borders, and armed civilians often pose a bigger threat than armies. In the Cold War era – while certainly not a time of peace, the political sphere was subject to a number of unspoken rules, and both sides acted accordingly to prevent the ever-present threat of global warfare that constantly lingered above the world. Seattle Peace Park is a heartwarming reminder of the Cold War from children’s perspectives. Along the main alley of the park (officially known as Babur Park), ceramic tiles along the way display hopes of peace and a better future. These tiles were made in the 1980s by schoolchildren from Seattle, hence the unusual inofficial name of the park. The 10,000 tiles of the park are incredibly moving because of their simple, yet timeless message to favor peace and friendship over war and distrust. Seattle and Tashkent have – rather astonishingly – been twin cities since 1973, long before the relations of the superpowers began to thaw. The partnership between both cities began only five years after the Soviet intervention during the Prague Spring in 1968. It was the first city partnership between a U.S. city and a Soviet city and it has continued until today. Update as of August 2019: The Babur Recreation Park is currently closed for remodeling. While it is possible to walk through the area, most of the attractions are closed or in a state of semi-repair. Update as of July 2021: The park remains closed.",urban parks cold war outsider art monuments military
34,Yodgorlik Silk Factory,"Margilan, Uzbekistan",Witness traditional silk production in the Uzbek city that's been a hub of sericulture for over a thousand years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yodgorlik-silk-factory,"Since medieval times, the ancient city of Margilan in Uzbekistan’s Fergana Valley has been known for its fabled “Khan-atlas,” or “royal silk.” Its factories still produce the famous handmade silk today, and at least one of them continues to use age-old methods passed down from generation to generation. Ringed by the Tien Shan mountains to the north, the Gissar Alai to the south, and watered by the Syr Darya river and its tributaries, the beauty of this fertile valley is legendary. Babur, the founder of the mighty Moghul Empire that ruled much of the Indian subcontinent for over 300 years, was born in Fergana Valley and eulogized its beauty in his memoirs. From the reign of the Chinese Han dynasty onwards, the region was traversed by ancient trade routes from China. Caravans laden with silks, teas, and spices came through the mountain passes and crossed the valley, heading to destinations in the Middle East and beyond. Bales of lustrous, richly hued Margilani silk were certainly among the precious merchandise picked up by the caravans on their journey westward. The specifics of how the Margilani people acquired the secrets of sericulture, as practiced by the ancient Chinese, are not known. But given that the market towns and caravanserais along the silk routes not only facilitated trade but also allowed for cross-cultural interactions and the dissemination of ideas, it’s easy to see how the transfer of knowledge may have happened with the right inducement. Over a thousand years later, Margilan’s “Yodgorlik” factory (which means “souvenir” in Uzbek) still uses these traditional methods of silk production. A tour of the factory usually begins at the venerable 140-year-old mulberry tree. From there you can see each step of the process, which is all done by hand: boiling the cocoons of the silkworms and extracting the silk thread, spinning and dyeing the silk, using vegetable dyes and sometimes crushed minerals, and lastly weaving the colorful ikat fabric on traditional looms. Since Fergana Valley is also a major producer of cotton, the Yodgorlik factory also produces a fabric that is a blend of cotton and silk, called “Adras.”  Driving from Tashkent to the city of Fergana is recommended; Margilan is less than a half hour away from Fergana. Though the drive may take up to six hours, including pit stops, the scenery is breathtaking and not to be missed. Come springtime, the mountainsides are ablaze with red tulips, which grow wild in these regions.",silk road crafts factories ancient history
35,Tomb of Ali at Shakhimardan,"Ulugnor District, Uzbekistan",Beautiful palace stands tall over the Fergana Valley.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-ali-at-shakhimardan,"On the edge of the Fergana Valley, a region in Central Asia where Taikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan all meet lies an area that is packed with enclaves, tiny territories completely surrounded by foreign territory. There stands the Tomb of Ali at Shakhimardan. Now nearly meaningless to those who live in its shadows, the Tomb of Ali at Shakhimardan once formed the center of a powerful khanate, or state in Central Asia. The Tomb gained its importance when Fergana became a province unto itself under Russian rule in the 19th century. Known as one of the most beautiful palaces anywhere in or around Uzbekistan, the Tomb of Ali at Shakhimardan is located 1,500 meters above sea level, so it looks out over the territory that surrounds it. Nestled into the mountains of the Alai Range, the Tomb looks like something out of Tolkien as imagined by Peter Jackson in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The palace is associated with Hazrat Ali, the fourth caliph, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammed. While in Central Asia, some say, Ali visited the village of Shakhimardan and decided he needed a place to stay when he returned. Translated from the Persian, Shakhimardan means “Lord of the people,” which is clearly how Ali saw himself.",memento mori catacombs and crypts ruins architectural oddities architecture
36,Kitab State Geological Reserve,"Shakhrisabz, Uzbekistan",The rocks are a time capsule of a 407-million-year-old Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kitab-state-geological-reserve,"Today, southeastern Uzbekistan is marked by dry, mountainous terrain, but hundreds of millions of years ago, this patch of the Earth was the bottom of a shallow sea where bizarre creatures crept across the soft sediment. It was around this time that vertebrate animals—more specifically, the sharp-toothed Ichthyostega—first shuffled out of the water and adopted a land-based lifestyle. The seafloor sediments have long since hardened and tilted upward as the Turkestan Mountain Range emerged. The rocks now form platy fragments of limestone. Layers just inches thick represent thousands of years of slow seafloor accretion. These layers, one following another, extend for kilometers into the upper reaches of the mountains, cumulatively witnessing roughly 300 million years. Over this time, new animals evolved and were preserved in the gooey sediments, providing modern-day explorers with a unique window back in time. At the Kitab State Geological Reserve, visitors can see the world’s best-preserved time capsule of this momentous era in the planet’s history. It was first established decades ago as a base camp for the Soviet geologists who did much of the initial work in the area. Nestled in a leafy valley on the banks of a rustling river, the handful of buildings serve as an outpost for visitors and scholars alike. A couple of miles up the dirt road, numbers start to appear on rocks, blue paint markers counting down the eons to the most significant historical moment: the boundary between the Pragian and Emsian stages that occurred 407 million years ago. Over time, the rocks of Kitab have become a sort of geological holy grail. Geologists travel from around the world to take selfies with this vertical rock wall. Such an extensive, continuous record of the planet’s history is nearly unprecedented, and Kitab even caught the attention of the International Commission on Stratigraphy. The Commission is a group of obsessives that scours the world for the best-preserved rocks that tell Earth’s story. Each segment of deep time is assigned to a “standard section,” where chemical, biological, and geological signals give a rich sense of conditions at the time. If you want to know what things were like 2 million years ago, for example, pack your bags for Sicily; to set your time machine for 66 million years ago, head to Tunisia. Kitab will transport you to a 407 million-year-old Earth. Back down the road, the research station’s museum reveals the full scope of the rocks’ stories. In glass cabinets, beautifully preserved fossils—snails, corals, and soft-bodied creatures long since extinct—represent a sort of ancient zoo. Colorful geologic maps adorn the walls, the result of decades of painstaking work across the entire region to mark where one layer of rock ends and another begins. The area’s contemporary wildlife is also on display, as full snakes preserved in formaldehyde stretch several feet.",deep time geological oddities geology
37,Abu Sahiy,"Tashkent, Uzbekistan",The heartbeat of modern Uzbekistan’s thriving market culture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abu-sahiy,"For most tourists, Uzbekistan is synonymous with its ancient Silk Road bazaars in Samarkand or Bukhara. To wander through markets whose predecessors date back a millennia surrounded by blue-tiled minarets and mosques, can be a breath-taking experience. But there’s also a museum quality to these well-preserved, popular destinations. Visitors are far more likely to bump into tourists looking for souvenirs than any local doing their weekly shopping. For visitors wanting to capture a more authentic picture of contemporary Uzbek life, the Abu Saxiy market is the place to start. Located on the western edge of the capital, Tashkent, Abu Sahiy is Uzbekistan’s largest market. The vast scale of the site is almost the size of a small town. Since it was founded in 2006, the market has grown to cover more than 60 acres with around 3,000 stalls and even its own fire station. Visitors will find almost anything, whether its traditional clothing or Nike tracksuits. Rows of kitchen appliances and televisions sit next to steaming vats of rice and mounds of brightly colored spices. Just as colorful are the shipping containers that house most of the stalls. These containers have been a key part of the market’s identity since local businessman, Timur Tillyaev, founded the market by converting a few hundred of them into Abu Sahiy’s first stalls. Adaptable and cheap to rent, the containers became increasingly popular with traders and transformed the market into the main shopping mecca for Tashkent. Today, the market attracts thousands of visitors every day, but unlike the bazaars of Samarkand, you’ll be rubbing shoulders with locals rather than guided tours.  Abu Sahiy has its own transit center, making it easy to reach by bus from almost anywhere in Tashkent. There are several cafes and food stalls for those who want to sample the local cuisine.",shopping markets history & culture

The gate was once considered the largest gate in central Asia. Ak Saray was the residence of Tamerlane and the portal was likely the entrance to the palace. The palace was eventually destroyed by the Bukhara Emir. Today, much of the ruins have been restored and the rest of the palace ground is used for public shows.

At the height of the Kushan empire, Central Asia was a massive trade hub and location for cultural exchanges. The Silk Road connected various Buddhist centers and helped spread the religion across Asia. Near the Amu Darya, monasteries appear across the landscape. Around Termez, there are three monasteries or stupas, Zurmala Stupa, Feyaz Tepe, and Kara Tepe. Fayaz Tepe is the largest and oldest monastery near Termez. It contains many paintings, statues, and pottery. The monastery and the stupa are also protected by a new dome.

This massive, Soviet-built solar furnace is one of the largest in the world, and it looks like something straight out of a science fiction novel. This structure is known by several names, including the Institute of the Sun and Physics of the Sun. The Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan’s Physicotechnical Institute was first organized in 1943. Its earliest divisions focused on the study of nuclear physics and electronics, and in the 1980s a new group was established to study the sun. A solar research facility was built in the village of Changikhisarak, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside the city of Tashkent. At this new facility, the centerpiece was a massive solar furnace. Like the Odeillo Solar Furnace in France, it features a field of heliostats that direct sunlight into a large paraboloid concentrator. Its curved surface is covered with 10,700 small mirrors that bounce the light onto a large concave mirror. Built during the Soviet era, this complex construction of mirrors and steel continues to serve the purpose of exploring the use of solar rays. But hands down, after the tour you’ll have the feeling that this noble quest can be broken down to the phrase “will it melt?” Still, wandering through the massive array of mirrors is a once-in-a-lifetime experience as this furnace is one of only two ever built.  Access is only possible with a tour. For 50,000 som/person you will get a private tour with the Head of the Institute.

Located near the Vietnam-Laos border, the cave was found by a local man named Ho-Khanh in 1991. The locals, it is said, were too afraid of the cave to go exploring because of the sound coming from the fast-moving underground river, as well as the huge vertical drop. In 2009, a group of scientists from the British Cave Research Association began an extensive survey of the cave’s depths. According to Howard Limbert, the man leading the survey, the cave is five times larger than Phong Nha, which once held the title of the largest in Vietnam. The biggest chamber, his team found, is over five kilometers long and 200 meters tall. The jungle found inside of the cave has formed underneath a collapsed roof in one of the caverns. After the roof collapsed, enough light spilled into the cavern that vegetation was able to creep in slowly from outside. As the vegetation took hold, larger and larger plants began to grow, and now hornbills, flying foxes, and monkeys dwell in its branches. In 2013, public visits started to be offered by Oxalis that offer the chance to spend days inside exploring, as well as camping, in this massive cave.  As it turns out there is another larger cave in the area recently discovered, but kept a secret by the locals as this cave is such a boon to tourism.

42,Hồ Thuỷ Tiên,"tx. Hương Thủy, Vietnam","Vietnam's feral abandoned water park offers access to a post-apocalyptic funscape, now with fewer crocodiles.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ho-thuy-tien,"Opened in 2004 at a price tag of approximately three million USD, the Ho Thuy Tien water park opened its gates to the public when it was only partially completed. Bankrolled by Company Hue Tourism, debuting a half-finished dream turned out to be a bad business move; but, in an odd turn of events, ever since its closure, the park has provided Hue’s tourism industry with an off-the-books boon they never could have seen coming. In the heyday of Ho Thuy Tien, adults and children alike were magnetically attracted to the park’s signature giant, three-story-tall dragon aquarium. Rising from the lake at the park’s center, manta rays and sharks lined the walls of the interior staircase, built to resemble a dragon’s rib cage. On all sides of the dragon’s bowels were aquarium tanks full of live fish and crocodiles. These crocs would later rival the dragon as superstars of the abandoned park, as well. Even with an excited population of park-goers flocking to Ho Thuy Tien, drawn by the promise of cool waters and good times, something was amiss. Within just a few years, the business continued to experience problems. After it shuttered, plans to resurrect the park from its fiscal troubles by turning it into an eco-park swirled throughout Hue’s local media as recently as 2013. Instead, those revitalization plans died on the table, leaving the park to become a legendary destination for travelers to the region. Located ten kilometers outside of town, Ho Thuy Tien now exists in a sort of purgatory between worlds. When business was booming, the park was an easy-to-find destination, listed in guidebooks; no longer the case, Ho Thuy Tien is now – justifiably or not – a sort of badge of honor among travelers, with its coordinates passed from one another by word of mouth, though it’s just as easily Google-able. Located eight kilometers out of town, the park isn’t exactly easy to get to, but once there, visitors may be surprised to find a quasi-guard posted at the gate collecting “admission” to the site. Sometimes there’s even a refreshment cart in operation inside the abandoned park. The sight of a gigantic dragon laying claim to his lake is made more stunning for its crumbling state. The abandoned amphitheater where hundreds of spectators witnessed shows before the fun died is as eerie as expected, and the three remaining water slides rise through creeping woods, and the specter of abandoned crocodiles once kept alive by visiting backpackers still looms. Thankfully the latter, pitiable case seems to have been resolved in recent months, after repeated calls to WWF and PETA, until the Vietnamese government finally transported them to a proper wildlife park. Still, it seems best to avoid all water in the park both for reasons of sanitation and potential rogue chomping.  Best found by asking around, or locating via ""dropped pin"" coordinates. Be prepared to ""tip"" the guard at the gate for unfettered access to the park.

This unique structure, backdropped by beautiful scenery, makes for a stunning sight, as if it was plucked from a fantasy world. The giant hands supporting the bridge symbolize something divine, mythical, or godlike. It does look as though they are lifting the bridge as a gift from the ground. The bridge’s principle architect, Vu Viet Anh, has even said that the goal of the design was to “invoke the sensation of walking along a thread stretching through the hands of God.” Building the footbridge was an engineering challenge in order to not damage the cliff below and make the structure blend in with the forest around it. The hands are supported by frames modeled after anatomical structures and covered with decorative fiberglass. The position of each finger was carefully chosen to invoke the desired effect. It’s no secret that the construction of the Golden Bridge is a part of a $2 billion investment to lure more tourists to the area. With a bridge this spectacular in such a stunning landscape, it might just succeed.  The Golden Bridge (Cau Vang in Vietnamese) is the newest addition to the Sun World Ba Na Hills amusement park, located about 18 miles west of Da Nang. The walkway is at the top of the Ba Na Hills, accessible by a 20-minute cable car ride up the hill. The entrance fee to the amusement park includes the cable car to the Golden Bridge.

In some places the train is mere inches from the buildings.

45,Am Phu Cave,"Da Nang, Vietnam",This Vietnamese hell cave lets visitors take a walk through a devilish underworld full of demons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/am-phu-cave,"In the Marble Mountains of Vietnam there is a huge cave known as Am Phu, and deep inside is a re-creation of a Buddhist hell where sinners confess crimes, suffer punishments, and hope to reach heaven’s light. At the city limits of Da Nang sits a cluster of five outcroppings known as the Marble Mountains. Sculptors once mined their white marble to make Buddhist statues, and while they are still crafted and sold in the surrounding villages, the marble is now imported from China. Each mountain is named for a different element, with the largest and most famous, Thuy Son (the Water Mountain), housing the notorious Am Phu cave. Discovered in the 19th century, King Minh Mang named the cave Am Phu (Vietnamese for “hell”) to signify a yin-yang dualism: while the mountain’s topside is considered heaven, visitors first pass through subterranean caverns representing hell. Opened to tourists in 2006, the natural rock formations, stalactites, and pitch-dark tunnels are enhanced with frightening figures and altars created by local artists. It is not unlike walking through a haunted house, with surprises lurking around every corner. Visitors cross a bridge symbolizing the passage from Earthly existence into the afterlife, begining with a hellish realm of man-hungry crocodiles, violent demons, and fanged devils bathed in sinister red light, where hands reach up from the waters below and river monsters threaten to gnash their souls to bits. Once inside the depths of Am Phu, fragrant incense overwhelms the air. At a temple shrine visitors can confess their sins and repent before a marble scale weighs their good and bad deeds. These visions of punishment haunt visitors until, finally, a steep stone staircase ascends to a sunlit opening. The climb is no easy path to enlightenment. Infrequent railings, helpful but scary handhold rings embedded in the marble, and the very steep twisting stairs reward one with a grand balcony view and a high sense of accomplishment. But note, it’s a dead end from which you must descend the same, now scarier, route. Climbing the stairs to salvation isn’t supposed to be easy, but this is where heaven begins—next door, on top of Thuy Son there are more caves, as well as divine shrines and pagodas. There are also reminders of the Vietnam War, including a chamber once used as a Viet Cong field hospital, and a plaque commemorating a Women’s Artillery battalion that was based nearby and destroyed 19 U.S. aircraft. Along with the heavenly shrines and carvings, the yin and yang of war and peace.  Take Le Van Hien south and turn left onto Huyen Tran Cong Chua.

Suoi Tien, or “the fairy stream,” is the world’s first water park devoted to Buddhism, specifically the Southeast Asian animistic form of Buddhism. The animism works well for the theme park; instead of Mickey and Daffy, Suoi Tien has chosen the Dragon, Unicorn, Tortoise, and Phoenix as its sacred animals, used thematically throughout the massive water park. Furthermore, workers in golden monkey outfits roam the park taking pictures with visitors and causing “mischief.” The park focuses on Vietnamese history, folklore, and of course on the Buddha himself. Among the parks many features are an oversized golden dragon whose mouth contains a neon haloed shrine to Buddha, avenues lined with pillars in the shape of giant elephant tusks, a swimming pool surrounded by a massive concrete facade of dragons and a giant rotating frog sculpture at the entrance. Particularly delightful are the twelve story face’s of the Buddhist sages - with water slides emerging from their beards. Children might enjoy a dog or turtle shaped boat ride around the island pavilions. But, beware the cutely-named Palace of Unicorns which contains a surprisingly gory house of horrors within. Perhaps the strangest and most unnerving feature of the enormous park is the crocodile kingdom. A pond with over 1,500 live crocodiles, visitors are invited to feed them with raw meat attached to fishing poles. The whole thing is quite impressive and constructed on a huge scale.

When he kicked the bucket in 1925, Khai Dinh was laid to rest in his lavish tomb, complete with a golden effigy of himself in the inner chamber. What sets Khai Dinh’s tomb apart from the others around Hue is its architectural fusion of Chinese, Vietnamese, and European Gothic elements. There are fierce dragons guarding the steps, stone elephants and warriors outside, and finally, massive wrought iron gates at the entrance. The inside of the tomb has some of the Emperor’s personal effects and gifts, as well as incredibly intricate patterns of ceramic and glass decorating the walls. The exterior iron and stone are juxtaposed by a truly magnificent interior reflective of a prodigious Emperor. Ironically, the tomb is less a monument to the Emperor himself but more a monument to his excessive wealth and disconnect from the ordinary man. Khai Dinh was reputed to be a pawn of the colonial French – so much so, he was mocked as a salaried employee of the French government – and he taxed his people heavily to finance the building of the elaborate edifice.",memento mori catacombs and crypts monuments
49,100 Roofs Cafe,"Dalat, Vietnam",This Vietnamese bar doubles as a multistory labyrinth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/100-roofs-cafe,"For those who like a shot alongside their fantastical, creepy-fairy-tale architecture, there’s no better destination than Đà Lạt’s 100 Roofs Cafe. Tucked along a side road, the building is surprisingly inconspicuous from outside. Inside, a multistory labyrinth a-mazes visitors with stairways to nowhere, underwater arthropods, and—for those who manage to make it to the top—breathtaking views of the city. Don’t let the “cafe” in the name fool you: 100 Roofs is a bar, and while it does serve coffee, most patrons come in search of stronger stuff. Visitors have to buy at least a drink in lieu of a cover fee—a decent deal to experience an epic maze—but considering the dim lighting and uneven surfaces, it may be wise to know your limits. In the midst of the maze, dead ends abound, sculpted women twist out of the walls, and tunnels appear seemingly out of nowhere. Once you emerge on the open roof, a tiered garden continues upward, ending in a sweeping view of Đà Lạt and, if you’re lucky, the night sky. Perhaps this is why locals call the building Đường Lên Trăng, or “the Way to the Moon.” Đà Lạt, the capital of Vietnam’s Lâm Đồng Province, is a small city that’s packed with architectural wonders. Besides the Way to the Moon, the city is also home to the “Crazy House,” a guesthouse whose toadstool twists and timber-like facade were the passion project of expressionist Vietnamese architect Đặng Việt Nga. Perhaps this concentration of architectural oddities explains the 100 Roofs Cafe’s magical vibe: Guests have compared the building to Hogwarts or hobbit homes in the Shire. If you pay the cafe a visit, enjoy sipping a drink while wandering through the labyrinth—just watch your footing lest you trip on an intoxicated Bilbo Baggins.  The bar is just 330 feet (100 meters) from the main market, but can be a bit tricky to find in its narrow-alleyed neighborhood.

Rice farmers working in the red river delta conceived this unusual art form over 1,000 years ago, likely when farmers adapted conventional puppetry onto water after a large flood. Although water puppetry is now performed across Vietnam and even tours the world, the most revered performance house is Thang Long Municipal theatre, located in the heart of Hanoi. At performances here, puppeteers stand waist deep in the water behind a screen, and operate the puppets on large rods to give the impression that the figures are moving across the water. Performances involve between 7 and 11 puppeteers who usually train for at least three years. In the past, skills were passed from father to son, as villagers feared that daughters would pass on the secrets of water puppetry when marrying outside of the village. The performances are accompanied by traditional Vietnamese folk music played on drums, cymbals, wooden bells, horns, bamboo flutes, and a single stringed guitar. The music is an integral part of the show, with the instrumentalists often shouting words of encouragement to the puppets.   The shows draw from both human and animal puppets to depict traditional Vietnamese folk tales and legends, such as the Legend of the Restored Sword of King Le (the story of Hoan Kiem Lake and the giant tortoise), a boy riding a buffalo whilst playing a flute, and fire breathing dragons dancing on the water, complete with fireworks. If used on a daily basis, the average lifespan of a water puppet is four months, meaning that some villages in Northern Vietnam are able to maintain their income and livelihoods on manufacturing water puppets.  Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre is right by Hoan Kiem Lake in the centre of Hanoi, and is near some of the most popular tourist attraction. The theatre is a 10 minute taxi ride from Hanoi's main station or a 25 minute walk. Between October and April, the Water Puppet Theatre can be very busy, so it is advisable to book in advance. There is an extra charge if you wish to bring a camera to the performance. Be wary of sitting in the front row - you may get wet!",theater puppets performances art
51,Dong Van Karst Plateau,"Đồng Văn, Vietnam",This striking landscape in northern Vietnam contains both geological and archaeological wonders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dong-van-karst-plateau,"Located over 1,000 meters above sea level, Dong Van Karst Plateau consists of narrow valleys alternating with rocky mountain ranges in the north of Vietnam. Over 80 percent of the surface is covered with limestone, including a high concentration of rocky peaks sitting over 2,000 meters above sea level. The rock of Dong Van is believed to contain fossils from 400 million to 600 million years ago. This geological anomaly—recognized by UNESCO in October 2010 as one of just 77 geological parks in the world—spreads over the districts of Meo Vac, Dong Van, Yen Minh and Quan Ba, encompassing a total area of 2,300 square kilometers. At the center of the plateau is Dong Van Town, located 150 kilometers from the center of Ha Giang Province. The plateau is not only a fascinating landscape but also an extraordinary piece of history. Archeologists have carried out excavations in the Quan Ba and Yen Minh districts on Dong Van Plateau and discovered many stone tools from the Son Vi Civilization, dating back 10,000 to 30,000 years. This is important evidence that prehistoric men resided on the rock plateau. Excavations in Can Ty Commune, Quan Ba District have found nearly 200 farming tools of prehistoric men. From Noi Bai International Airport, head onto National Road No.2 to the north for 320 kilometers to arrive at the very peaceful Ha Giang Town by the Mien River. To get the karst plateau:
From Ha Giang City, visitors travel on National Highway 4C for 43km to Quan Ba. Continuing on this highway through Can Ty Pass, pine forests, steep drops, deep ravines, and razor sharp turns, visitors will reach to Dong Van karst plateau.",landscapes rocks geological oddities archaeology geology
52,Anthony Bourdain and Barack Obama's Dinner Table,"Hanoi, Vietnam",The spot where the two men ate together now stands enclosed in glass.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anthony-bourdain-and-barack-obama-dinner-table,"In May 2016, the Vietnamese noodle store Bún Chả Hương Liên went from relative obscurity to being on television screens all over the world, after two of the world’s most famous men chose it as their dinner spot in Hanoi. Anthony Bourdain and President Barack Obama came for the slippery noodles or fragrant pork patties—but the world tuned in not for the food, but to see these two icons sit on blue plastic stools drinking chilled bottles of local beer. At the time of the meal, Bourdain was filming the CNN series Parts Unknown. A year earlier, he told the network, the White House had reached out to try to arrange a meal between the president and himself: something fun and unexpected. This relative hole-in-the-wall, where the total cost of the meal came in at under $10, fit the bill. (Bourdain picked up the check.) Footage from the series shows the men laughing and chatting over their noodles like two old friends. “Is it appropriate to chuck one of these whole suckers in your mouth?” the president asks, gesturing at a patty with his chopsticks. “Well, slurping is totally acceptable in this part of the world,” Bourdain replies, with a laugh. They received no directive from the White House about which topics were and were not up for discussion, Bourdain later told the network. “We spoke like two dads, and Southeast Asian enthusiasts, and had a good time.” Today, the restaurant continues to thrive. It looks much as it did when Bourdain and Obama sat down to eat there, but there are a few key changes. Guests hoping to relive the experience can now order a “Combo Obama” from the menu: bun cha, a seafood spring roll, and a bottle of Hanoi beer for a total of 105,000 VND, or about $4.50. But what they can’t do is sit down at that same table, in those same blue plastic stools. The restaurant’s encased the entire set-up in glass for posterity. (From time to time, they also pop a decorative plant on top.) The metal-topped table’s still set, as if waiting for the return of its diners, ready with plates, bowls, chopsticks, and beers. When Bourdain died in June 2018, Obama tweeted a photo of the two men drinking their beers in that restaurant, with the caption: “This is how I’ll remember Tony. He taught us about food — but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We’ll miss him.”",celebrity presidents food

Several levels up, in fact. To reach it, you must first walk through a clothing store, down a narrow hallway, then across a courtyard filled with birdcages, plants, and the occasional roaming chicken. Then, you’ll start ascending the stairs, up through what seems to be a home, past a family shrine and a portly ginger cat, and finally to the roof. You could sit on the floor below the roof, but then you wouldn’t get the same delightful views of the city, including the green expanse of Hoan Kiem Lake. Slide into one of the patio chairs and sip on cà phê trứng, also known as Vietnamese egg coffee, a popular style that adds a whisked egg and usually a heaping helping of sugar or condensed milk to Robusta coffee for a decadent, foamy effect. Chocolate fans should try the cacao trứng, which adds hot cocoa to the mix for rich, mocha flavors. If it’s hot out, the cafe serves iced versions of most of its brews, as well. You’ll place your order at one of the lower floors.

For thousands of Viet Cong soldiers, this sprawling network of cramped passageways was an entire world unto itself, complete with living quarters, communications centers and hospitals. Though the tunnels became famous in the Vietnam War, parts of the network were first constructed in the 1940s by peasants fighting French occupation forces. By the mid-1960s, the tunnel system had grown to over 75 miles in length. Viet Cong soldiers living in the tunnels would spend most of their day digging new passageways, only daring to venture out at night for supplies and to perform guerilla raids. Defensive measures built into the network included explosive booby traps and stake pits, making the work of American soldiers attempting to infiltrate the tunnels incredibly dangerous. Beyond the intentional deterrents, the tunnels were also hot, damp and infested with a variety of snakes and insects; reports suggest that as many as half of all Viet Cong soldiers were infected with malaria at any given time. American bombing raids succeeded in destroying sections of the tunnel network near the end of the war, but much of the system remains intact. It has since become a tourist attraction, where visitors can attempt to crawl through a short passage - or, if necessary, a section that has been widened for the convenience of westerners.",tunnels subterranean sites

In the Crazy House, Antoni Gaudi meets Alice in Wonderland in a fantastic folly of twisting, tree-trunk-like concrete and artificial caverns, winding flights of stairs and irregular windows, stalactites and stalagmites, flowering purple vines, and an over-sized sculpture of a giraffe. The interiors are no less intriguing. In one room, guests are watched over by the glowing red eyes of a kangaroo. Other rooms feature elaborate local tribal decorations, or carved birds looming over beds tucked snugly into cave-like nooks. The whole complex was a labor of love for avant-garde architect Hang Nga, who lives on site and sometimes chats with guests. She is an interesting person to talk to; besides designing buildings like this and her other Da Lat landmark (“The House of One Thousand Roofs,” now demolished), she is daughter of a former Vietnamese vice president. Sightseers are welcome to tour the building during the day for a small fee or to book a room and stay the night. Bring warm clothes: the Da Lat Crazy House is at a high altitude, and all that concrete gets mighty chilly after sunset.  A 10 minute taxi ride from the center of town.

While there are other sites featuring the remnants of Cham architecture the remaining towers in Phan Thiết are some of the more representative examples of the lost culture’s architecture. Echoing the spires and details on such sites as Angkor Wat, the Po Shanu Cham towers look like the ruins of an otherworldly culture. Unfortunately, it is easy to tell that even with the remaining structures, the site must have been a great deal more impressive, and likely featured a number of other buildings that were lost to time. Now the Po Shanu Cham towers consist of just two pointed towers, and third building that adjoins the more decorative constructions. Little is known about the exact history of the towers, and unfortunately they have fallen into a bit of disrepair thanks to neglect and unfortunately destructive restoration efforts. Nonetheless these ancient intricate stone spires will hopefully survive long enough to be preserved for later generations to see the works of the Cham for themselves.",towers ruins

58,B-52 Wreckage,"Hanoi, Vietnam","Monument to a brutal, ineffectual US bombing campaign and a sobering reminder of the human cost of the Vietnam War.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/b52-wreckage,"In the residential Ba Dinh district of Hanoi lies a sobering reminder of the human cost of the Vietnam War – wreckage of a B-52 bomber shot down shortly before the war ended. Operation Linebacker II, known internationally as the Christmas Bombing, was a bombing campaign of three thousand sorties carried out by American forces between December 18th and 29th, 1972. Intended to compel North Vietnamese leaders to sign a provisional peace agreement, Linebacker II targeted military installations in the heavily populated area between Hanoi and Haiphong. Despite the intended targets and the evacuation of nearly half a million civilians from those cities, 1,318 civilians were killed in the bombing, arousing international condemnation. In retaliation, North Vietnamese forces launched more than 1,200 missiles and shot down fifteen B-52 bombers, capturing 31 crewmen and killing many more. An artifact from this last paroxysm of violence in the American portion of the war remains out in the open in the quiet neighborhood of Ngoc Ha. In Huu Tiep Lake, the rear landing gear and undercarriage of an American B-52 bomber rests where it fell after being shot down on December 27th, 1972. A nearby plaque describes the event in typically florid language: “The Battalion No72 – Air Defence Missile Regiment No285 shot down on the spot a B52G of the US imperialist violating Ha Noi airspace … creating an important change that led the Vietnamese people’s anti-US resistance for national salvation to the complete victory.” The well-kept houses reflected in the waters surrounding the twisted remnants offer a sharp contrast between modern Hanoi and the horrors still in living memory of its inhabitants. While American forces had been bombing the North Vietnamese for eight years, it was thought that the Christmas Bombing would force them to sue for a peace more acceptable to the U.S. and South Vietnam. The peace terms signed in January of 1973 differed only slightly from the terms proposed by North Vietnam before the bombing.  Huu Tiep Lake is a twenty-minute walk west of the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in the Ba Dinh district, just west of Hanoi’s Old Quarter. If you walk west on Hoang Hoa Tham Avenue where it meets Ngoc Ha Avenue, you should see a sign directing you to the memorial down a narrow street.",vietnam war bombs airplanes war history monuments military

Located in Ba Dinh Square, where Ho read the Declaration of Independence on September 2, 1945, thus establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, this impressive monument contains a glass casket, which holds Ho Chi Minh’s body. Vietnam’s Communist Party flag hangs over the casket.

61,Vịnh Mốc Tunnel Complex,"Vĩnh Thạch, Vietnam","This network of tunnels housed an entire village for years, and even had a hall for screening movies.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/v-nh-m-c-tunnel-complex,"There are a handful of Vietnamese men and women, roughly in their early 40s, who share a very unusual distinction: They were born in the Vinh Moc tunnel complex in the Quang Tri region, while their families took shelter from bombs raining down on their village during the Vietnam War. The tunnel network was created in the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone in 1965-66, starting at 32 feet (10 meters) underground. The U.S. military believed that the residents of Vinh Moc were supplying food and ammunition to Con Co island, a nearby North Vietnamese military base; to force the villagers to move out, American forces rained up to 500 rockets a day on the region. Instead of fleeing, the villagers went underground. What began as a few tunnels expanded to a network of around 5,200 feet (1600 meters), with 13 entrances leading from the beach and inland hills. The tunnels were divided into three levels, the deepest at 75 feet (23 meters) deep. Around 400 people from 60 families frequently took refuge there until 1972; their longest continuous stay underground was for 18 months. Today the tunnels function as a museum. Visitors can see how the two lower levels housed the family quarters. There was a communal kitchen and washrooms, a maternity room, lookout posts, and even an 80-person meeting hall where films were screened, all carved out of hardened clay. One of the key architects of the caves was Le Xuan Vy, whose first son was born in the caves in 1967. While life and birth went on for months and years underground, the huts and buildings in Vinh Moc were leveled. But the tunnel complex served its purpose—no lives were lost in the subterranean village. Visiting the Vinh Moc tunnels is a little bit more comfortable than the Cu Chi Tunnels near Ho Chi Minh City, because of the drier climate. Be prepared to sweat nonetheless. Inside the tunnels, it can be wet and slippery sometimes.The height of the tunnels allow most people to walk upright, although you might want to keep your head down a little bit. If you’re claustrophobic, it might not be the best attraction to visit. The stories you might hear from the guides or read about in the museum can be a little bit one-sided as well.",vietnam war subterranean underground tunnels subterranean sites caves war history ecosystems military
62,Hỏa Lò Prison,"Hanoi, Vietnam","The notorious ""Hanoi Hilton"" where Vietnamese colonial subjects and later American POWs, including John McCain, were imprisoned.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/h-a-lo-prison,"The French called it Maison Central, a generic name for a colonial prison. The Vietnamese knew it as Hỏa Lò, which translates to “fiery furnace,” after the wood stove shops common in the surrounding neighborhood. Westerners know it best as the Hanoi Hilton. Whatever its name, the notorious prison housed a century of torture within its walls. The Hỏa Lò prison opened in 1886, when Vietnam was under French colonial rule as part of Indochina. Most of its prisoners at that time were political agitators. The Vietnamese nickname “Hỏa Lò” (“furnace” or “stove”) came to be a double entendre for the prison’s hellish treatment. Its capacity was stretched from a few hundred to 2,000 prisoners living in squalid conditions, chained to walls by the dozen. The prison had become the symbol for France’s oppression of Vietnam, so when the French were ousted from Hanoi in 1954, the Vietnamese repurposed the prison as their own. When Americans invaded, the North Vietnamese designated a special section specifically for prisoners of war. The American prisoners were mostly Air Force pilots, shot down from the sky and collected from the jungle. They often came to Hỏa Lò injured, and their conditions only worsened from there. U.S. Senator John McCain was one such inmate. He was captured and taken to Hỏa Lò with a broken knee, among other injuries. The prison authorities refused to treat him until they discovered his father was a high ranking admiral. McCain stated that this was why, “there were hardly any amputees among the prisoners who came back.” The North Vietnamese would not waste their time providing medical care. Though Vietnam had agreed to the terms of the Geneva Convention, prohibiting cruel and unusual treatment of prisoners of war, rumors of brutal torture and solitary confinement at the “Hanoi Hilton” grew infamous throughout the military. Toward the end of the war, the POWs were slowly released from Hỏa Lò. It continued to imprison political rebels for two decades, but in 1990 the prison was shut down and mostly demolished to make way for high rises in developing Hanoi. The piece of the historic prison that remains is preserved as a museum. The Vietnamese government maintains that reports of POW torture during the Vietnam War are fabrications, despite many accounts from previous inmates. As such, the exhibit from this era shows photos of American prisoners living a comfortable life: playing chess, raising chickens, etc. Artifacts from well-known prisoners are also on display, including McCain’s flight suit and parachute. The bulk of the museum focuses on the French Colonial period, and does not shy away from showing torture in detail. The stocks, the cramped solitary confinement cells, and the guillotine room are only a glimpse of the heinous treatment prisoners received at Hỏa Lò.",vietnam war torture prisons colonialism military history military

He stepped out of the baby blue automobile onto a busy intersection and sat calmly in the lotus position while a colleague poured gasoline from a five-gallon container over his head. Holding onto a string of prayer beads, the Buddhist monk spoke the words “Nam mô A Di Đà Phật” (“Homage to Amitābha Buddha”), struck a match, and placed it against his fuel-soaked robe. In the 1950s, South Vietnam had become increasingly hostile towards its Buddhist citizenry.  Buddhists made up an estimated 70 percent to 90 percent of the population, but the country’s first president, Ngô Đình Diệm, represented the Catholic minority. He took office in 1955 and enacted discriminatory policies that favored Catholics and neglected Buddhists for public service roles, military promotions, land allocation, and business arrangements. Despite an overwhelming majority of Buddhist citizens, the Roman Catholic Church was the largest landowner in Vietnam at the time. In 1959, a ban on flying the Buddhist flag on the birthday of Gautama Buddha exacerbated the public discontent, and people took to the streets in protest. Government forces fired on the crowd and killed nine people. Diệm refused to accept responsibility, and outrage and consequential protests increased in the following years. On June 11, 1963, Thích Quảng Đức, surrounded by a circle of protesters, burned himself to death. He described his intentions in a final note: “I respectfully plead to President Ngô Đình Diệm to take a mind of compassion towards the people of the nation and implement religious equality to maintain the strength of the homeland eternally.” In 2010, a memorial, displaying the monk wreathed in flames, was installed on the very corner where he died a half century before (now Nguyễn Đình Chiểu and Cach Mạng Thang Tam streets). Prior to the statue, which sits in front of a bas-relief depicting the powerful action, American journalist Malcolm Browne’s photographs were the most accessible reminders of the event. He described the moment in a 1995 interview with the BBC: “I just kept shooting and shooting and shooting.

68,Hospital Cave,"Trân Châu, Vietnam",This cavern was used as a hidden hospital and safe house during the Vietnam War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hospital-cave,"Invisible from both road and air, Hospital Cave was strategically important in the Vietnam-American War. Built from 1963-65 with the help of the Chinese, the concrete bombproof cave was laid out over three stories; the bottom two acted as a hospital where soldiers could rest, recuperate and relax, and the tiny third floor acted as a safe house for Viet Cong leaders. The shelter was equipped with access to fresh water and ventilation shafts, and there are even escape tunnels ready for the event of a quick getaway. Hospital Cave was abandoned in 1975, but in recent years has become a popular attraction on Cat Ba, where English-speaking guides show visitors around, fully justifying the extremely cheap 15,000 dong entrance fee. Although the rooms are now empty, it’s possible to see the how the Hospital was once set up. It includes an operating theatre, doctors office, several recovery rooms, and a huge natural cavern that was used as a cinema room. Hospital Cave is a popular stop off for day-trippers on Cat Ba Island. Located on the road linking Cat Ba town to the National Park and the ferry port to Haiphong and Halong city, but is difficult to get to without private transport. The easiest way to get there is to rent a scooter from one of the many rental shops in Cat Ba town (usually costing around 100,000 – 150,000 Vietnamese Dong) and then travel 10km North until signs for the cave appear. Cat Ba Island is one of the easiest places to ride a scooter in Vietnam, with mostly well maintained roads carrying little traffic. However, if scooters aren’t for you, then a taxi from the town is the next best option.

But it has one very particular claim to fame — a spectacular temple that is the headquarters of the Cao Dai movement, a religion founded in 1926 claiming millions of Vietnamese adherents. Cao Dai temples are common and easily distinguishable by their bright colors and carved ornamentation, but Tay Ninh’s “Holy See” is easily the most impressive. The vaulted mosque-like pillars and multicolored pagodas represent the religion’s beliefs: that many great spiritual figures from the East and West such as Lao Tzu, Buddha, Christ, Mohammed, Jesus, Sun Yat Sen, Nguyen Binh Khiem, Joan of Arc and Victor Hugo, were prophets of the same universal truth. Until the 1970s, Cao Dai was a potent political force. Religious leaders commanded their own army and enjoyed the right to tax local people (thus funding the 1935 construction of this lavish Hollywood-meets-the-Orient temple). But the Communists stripped them of those powers and these days the Tay Ninh Holy See draws only white-clad pilgrims and busloads of curious tourists, who come to watch the daily mass. The past political persecution of the Cao Daoists is evidenced by the trap door exit at the back of the altar. The ceremony features singing and a procession of colorfully-dressed priests who file around a giant orb painted with a single eye, representing the heart and the spirit of God. At the temple’s entrance, a scroll shows Nguyen Binh Khiem (a Vietnamese poet), Sun Yat Sen (first president of China), and Victor Hugo (French author of such books as “Les Misérables”) receiving a message from God.  The Holy See is located 4 km east of the centre of Tay Ninh. Tours are easy to arrange from Ho Chi Minh city.

70,The Fairy Stream,"Phan Thiet, Vietnam",This whimsically named Vietnamese stream is closer to a walkway than a waterway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-fairy-stream-2-phan-thiet-vietnam,"Known mainly for its sand dunes, the small town of Mui Ne in Vietnam is also home to a soft red creek known as the Fairy Stream that is colored by the clay and limestone particles that filter in from the strange rock formations at its shores. Winding its way through bamboo forests, boulders, and the dunes behind Mui Ne, the whimsically-named Fairy Stream resembles a miniature version of the Grand Canyon in places. For the most part, the stream is about ankle-deep and no more than knee-deep even at its deepest and visitors are encouraged to take off their shoes and follow right along the creek-bed. The soft red dirt is remarkably pleasant to walk through, avoiding the exposed sand and rocks on the shore that can get quite hot. The pitted rock formations off to the sides of the stream also seem like the perfect hiding place for any potential fairies which may be where the stream gets its name. However it could also simply be the image of people strolling through the opaque red waters as though it were a groomed hiking trail, like the hikers themselves were children of nature.

71,Saigon Central Post Office,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",This French colonial post office is arguably the grandest in all of Southeast Asia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saigon-central-post-office,"Built during French colonial times, the Saigon Central Post Office is perhaps among the most impressive post offices in Southeast Asia. Often erroneously attributed to Gustave Eiffel, it was, in fact, the last work of Marie-Alfred Foulhoux, Saigon’s acclaimed Architect-in-Chief. In 1874, the French architect Marie-Alfred Foulhoux (1840-1892) moved to the recently established French colony of Cochinchina in South Vietnam. After five years in Saigon, he was appointed Architect-in-Chief and spent much of the rest of his life designing and building some of the most important buildings in the city, including the Palais de Justice, the Customs Department building, and the Lieutenant Governor’s Palace. His final work, built between 1886 and 1891, was the Saigon Central Post Office. Constructed around a prefabricated cast iron frame, with a towering vaulted ceiling and arched windows, the post office mixes European architecture—French, Gothic and Renaissance—with East Asian designs. Along the light-yellow Neo-Baroque facade, window plaques bear the names of leading scientists and philosophers, including Descartes, Morse, Ampere, Volta, Ohm, and Faraday. The decoration of the roof ridges, meanwhile, was inspired by Khmer art. Walk inside, and you’ll be struck by the sense of space under the huge vaulted ceiling, supported by two rows of steel pillars, not too dissimilar to an old European railway station. It’s very much a colonial building, with ornate wooden counter-tops, patterned tiled floors, and antiquated telephone boxes. But though much of the space feels European, it contains a few reminders that you’re still in Saigon, such as the large portrait of Ho Chi Minh on the far wall. That, and the two historic maps painted on either wall, one depicting the telegraph lines of southern Vietnam and Cambodia in 1892, and the other a map of Saigon and its surroundings in 1892. Another iconic feature of the post office is Mr. Duong Van Ngo, who you’ll typically find sitting at a table underneath the portrait of Ho Chi Minh. Mr. Ngo, now in his late 80s, has been working at Saigon Central Post Office since he was 17. For more than 25 years, he has faithfully served as the post office’s letter writer, writing letters for those who cannot write for themselves. Pen in hand, he writes in French and English, and charges about 50 cents per page.  Saigon Central Post Office is a fully-functional post office, from where you can send and receive mail, buy stamps and postcards, make international calls, and exchange foreign money. It's located at 2 Công xã Paris, Bến Nghé, close to Diamond Plaza and Notre Dame Cathedral in downtown Ho Chi Minh City. The post office's business hours are from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., although the building sometimes remains open for longer for visitors who just want to look around.",postal mail colonialism architecture

Known colloquially as “Snake Village” (a nickname that is undoubtedly encouraged in an effort to draw tourists), Lệ Mật is run through with winding streets where the daring traveler can find a collection of restaurants advertising that snake is on the menu. The people of the village have long been known as expert snake hunters and exterminators, being hired out all around the city to take care of slithering infestations. Now they’ve turned that expertise into culinary gold. Both tourists and desultory local businessmen flock to the village every night to get lit on snake shots and fill up on their guts. After the size and type of snake is chosen, the living specimen is presented to diners and the heart is removed, dropped instantly into a shot of blood and vodka. After that still-beating amuse-bouche, another sickly shot is created using the snake’s bile. Then the fresh corpse is taken to the kitchen and introduced into ten different dishes, including crisped snake skin and crushed-bone poppadoms. For many, the wholesale snake slaughter that takes place in the name of drawing some local business is a less-than-savory practice. But many visitors seem to enjoy the savory dishes. 7 km northeast of central Hanoi, Vietnam, in the city's Long Biên District. Best reached by taxi.",snakes villages food
73,Côn Đảo Prison,"Côn Đảo, Vietnam",The wartime prison now features haunting sculpted reenactments of the atrocities that took place there.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/con-d-o-prison,"On the remote tropical island of Côn Sơn, off the coast of Vietnam, is a sprawling prison museum known as Côn Đảo Prison. Passed down through successive repressive regimes, the prison museum features beautiful colonial architecture dotted with terrifying life-sized sculptures depicting the torture and abuse of prisoners. Originally built by the French colonial government in 1861 to house political prisoners, Côn Đảo Prison was transferred to the South Vietnamese government in 1954, which utilized it for the same purpose, with the help of the United States. This fascinating complex of buildings is now run by the Vietnamese government and maintained as a special historical site open to the public. Although wandering through the historic stone buildings and courtyards seems tranquil at first, a peek inside many of the cells reveals life-sized sculptures immortalizing the wide variety of atrocities that took place there. This prison is most infamously known for the “Tiger Cages,” notoriously cramped cells built in 1940 by the French to keep prisoners of war. During the Vietnam-American War prisoners were caged in the cells like animals, brutally tortured, and mutilated. The cages were hidden away from the main prison, unknown until 1970 when a visiting U.S. congressional delegation investigating the Vietnam War discovered them and revealed them to the public. Today you can see sculptures recreating how prisoners of war were crammed into tiny cells and shackled to concrete beds, while guards poked at them with long bamboo poles from a catwalk above. Côn Sơn Island (also known as Con Lon) is the largest of the Côn Đảo archipelago in Vietnam’s Ba Ria–Vung Tau province. While for decades the paradise island was home to prisoners, isolated and removed from the mainland, more recently has attracted tourists thanks to its beautiful beaches and tropical forests.

74,Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Witnesses claim the Virgin Mary statue outside the church once mysteriously shed a single tear.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/notredame-cathedral-basilica-of-saigon,"Built between 1863 and 1880 by French colonists, the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon is the most impressive cathedral in Vietnam. Modeled on Notre-Dame de Paris and built with materials shipped over from France, the cathedral is the religious center for Vietnam’s 6.2 million Catholics. Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon has gone by various names over the years. It began life in 1863 as Saigon Church, built by French colonists shortly after France conquered and began to colonize Saigon. Saigon Church was a simple wooden construction with a bad case of termites, which caused so much damage it had to be rebuilt. A design competition was held, which was won by French architect Jules Bourard, an expert in religious architecture. His plan was about as French as it gets: to build a smaller version of Notre-Dame de Paris, mirroring the famous cathedral’s form in the Romanesque and French Gothic style. Bishop Isidore Colombert laid the first stone in October 1877, and the completion ceremony was held in April 1880. Most of the materials used in the cathedral’s construction had been shipped over from France, including bricks from Toulouse that gave the cathedral its distinct red color, as still seen today. Two bell towers were added in 1895, breaking with the design of Notre-Dame de Paris but adding greatly to the dramatic impact and the height of the cathedral, which now reached up to an impressive 198 feet tall. In 1959, a statue of Our Lady of Peace was installed outside the church, made with granite in Rome. After the statue ceremony, Saigon Church became more commonly known as Notre-Dame Cathedral. In 1960 it earned the official title of Saigon Chief Cathedral, and two years later was anointed by Pope John XXIII, gaining basilica status and earning its current title of Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon. The cathedral last hit the international headlines in October 2005. According to some fervent witnesses, the statue of the Virgin Mary, located just outside the cathedral, began to cry. Apparently, a tear streaked down her right cheek, staining her granite countenance and causing thousands of people to flock to the cathedral to see this unconfirmed miracle. Traffic ground to a halt all around the cathedral and the police were called in to maintain order. The stain remained for over a week, and hundreds of people came to see it from across the country each day. The Catholic Church in Vietnam, however, could not confirm that the statue of the Virgin Mary had indeed shed any tears.  Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon is located in the heart of Saigon’s chaotic District 1, not far from Saigon Post Office and Reunification Palace. It is currently undergoing a massive renovation project that began in August 2017 and is expected to last until June 2020. While currently closed to tourists, it does still hold a mass every Sunday, in both Vietnamese and English, at 9:30 a.m. Or, you can just take a look at the cathedral's impressive architecture from the surrounding grounds.",catholic christianity colonialism churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
75,Nghia An Hoi Quan Pagoda,"Quận 5, Vietnam","One of the oldest temples in Ho Chi Minh City, dedicated to a deified Chinese military leader.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nghia-an-hoi-quan-pagoda,"The Nghia An Hoi Quan Pagoda was built by the Chaozhou Chinese population of Ho Chi Minh City sometime in the second half of the 19th century. One of the oldest temples in the city, it is dedicated to the deified Chinese military leader Quan Cong. During the 1800s, the Chinese population of Vietnam built a number of temples worshiping Quan Cong, none more important than the Nghia An Hoi Quan Pagoda. Quan Cong (c. 198-249) was a military leader of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Not only was he a courageous and decisive military commander, he was also known as an honorable and loyal general who respected tradition and engaged in charitable acts. Nghia An Hoi Quan is a fine example of Chinese religious architecture in Vietnam. Known for its elaborately gilded woodwork, intricate statues and other relics, the pagoda includes a main room, large front yard, and incense house. The main entrance is guarded by two stone “unicorns,” and a carved wooden boat hangs over the doorway. Inside the main room is a statue of Quan Cong dressed in his dragon robe, flanked by his two loyal attendants: Quan Binh, his chief mandarin, and Chau Xuong, his chief general. One of the most famous statues in the temple is that of Quan Cong’s red horse. The wooden statue of his faithful steed is considered particularly holy to the temple’s devotees, who come to ring a bell around its neck before crawling under the horse to its opposite flank, an action believed to draw blessings from the warhorse. Many more statues, small and large, of wood, stone, or ceramic, stand within the temple. Paintings and engravings depict Chinese legends and images of daily life and rural workers, and lanterns hang from the ceiling. Because of these artifacts and decorations, Nghia An Hoi Quan is more than just a shrine to Quan Cong: the temple also helps to bring Chinese culture and history to the descendants of the Chaozhou people who originally immigrated to Vietnam.  Nghia An Hoi Quan Pagoda is located at 678 Nguyen Trai Street in Cholon, within Ho Chi Minh City's Chinatown. The temple's main festival dedicated to Quan Cong takes place every year on the 13th day of the first lunar month.",culture temples military history religion military sacred spaces history
76,Lang Tan Temple (Temple of the Whale),"An Hải, Vietnam","Home to what locals claim is the largest whale skeleton in Southeast Asia, which is worshiped yearly.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lang-tan-temple,"Every spring, visitors flock to the Lang Tan Temple (Temple of the Whale) on the island of Ly Son off the coast of Vietnam to pray to what islanders claim is the largest whale skeleton in Southeast Asia. Fishing is an important industry on Ly Son, and reverence for the sea extends to its largest inhabitants. Anyone who finds a dead whale must make sure the whale is given a proper funeral. When the whale is on the beach, it is easier to make the arrangements, but a few years ago a fisherman brought a whale carcass he had found floating in the sea to shore to bury it. Ly Son fishermen believe that whales are their protectors, and that honoring them in their death will bring the fishermen luck. According to the legend of the King of Whales, the skeleton that is visited every spring is that of the most powerful whale to ever swim in the East Sea, between 200 and 300 years ago. The King of Whales was found dead on the beach in An Hai Commune, on Ly Son, and the islanders were unable to move it, so they buried it right there on the spot. The skeleton was later dug up and brought to the temple. The gigantic skeleton is now being restored, because parts of it have been damaged over the years. The skeleton is 130 feet long, with the head alone measuring nearly 10 feet. The whale’s vertebrae are 1.3 feet. Every two years, someone is selected to clean and prepare the skeleton for its showings. Visitors bring it offerings and ask it for help with things in their lives that are giving them trouble. The Lang Tan Temple is recognized as a national historic site by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism in Vietnam, but the King of Whales is not the only whale skeleton on Ly Son. About 100 more are maintained and worshiped in temples around the island, two of them sharing the Lang Tan Temple with the King of Whales.",folktales whale bones folklore whales skeletons bones temples islands animals

It isn’t your typical male Buddha effigy—this enormous structure depicts a woman. Buddhists the world over have built plenty of tall statues of Buddha. But “Buddha” does not just mean the man born Siddhartha Gautama. “Buddha” also means “Enlightened One,” and there’s no reason why a great sage can’t be a woman. The Linh Ung Pagoda, just outside Da Nang, Vietnam, decided to build the world’s largest statue of an indisputably feminine Buddha. The resulting Lady Buddha towers 220 feet (67 meters) tall and is perched atop of a lotus-shaped temple. The statue has 17 floors, with each floor dedicated to a different Buddha. Though the multi-level trek is tough, it’s worth it for the spectacular views of the city. There’s more to see at the temple in addition to the Buddha. The grounds display an impressive collection of relatively life-sized statues and topiaries, and also boasts a quiet mountainside view of the bustling city of Da Nang below.

79,Japanese Covered Bridge,"Thành phố Hội An, Vietnam",One of Vietnam's most iconic landmarks was built by Japanese merchants and is now in danger of sinking.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/japanese-covered-bridge,"Hoi An is an old port city in central Vietnam that flourished from the 16th to 19th-century, attracting traders from Japan, China, and Europe. Its historic district, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as the Hoi An Ancient Town, was divided between the Chinese and Japanese quarters, connected by a beautiful arched bridge. Chua Cau, commonly referred to as the Japanese Covered Bridge, is one of the most iconic sights in Hoi An’s old town, having survived the Vietnam War and noted for its ornate design. It was constructed by Japanese merchants in 1593, and in 1653, a small temple was erected at the center of the bridge. According to legend, the Japanese built the temple to subdue the Namazu, a mythical catfish monster that causes earthquakes. There are statues of a monkey and a dog on the ends of the bridge, inspired by the Chinese zodiac years on which its construction started and ended. The bridge was named “Lai Vien Kieu “(“bridge for passers-by from afar”) by Nguyen Phúc Chu in 1719 after a quote from the Analects of Confucius. In 1639, Japan adopted a strictly isolationist foreign policy resulting in the end of its trade with Vietnam. The Japanese quarter was all but abandoned, and the Dutch East India Company withdrew from Hoi An that same year. Eventually, its status as an important trade port was also passed on to Da Nang. Thanks to this, the city evaded damage during the Vietnam War, preserving its historic sites. That said, the current Japanese Covered Bridge is not the original that was built during the 16th-century. It has undergone several renovations and restorations, in fact, its architectural style has become more Chinese and Vietnamese than Japanese over time. Most recently, it was restored in 1986. The bridge was depicted on the 20,000 dong banknote, which was first issued in 2006. Currently, it’s suffering from erosion caused by the sewer below and is in danger of either tilting or sinking.  To explore the old town of Hoi An, visitors are expected to pay 120,000 VND (5 USD) to purchase a set of five tickets. While it's free of charge to cross the Japanese Covered Bridge, it costs one ticket to visit its temple.",bridges design history & culture architecture

It went down in history as something else entirely, after North Vietnamese communist tanks crashed through its gates during the Fall of Saigon in April, 1975. The iconic scene of the arriving tanks, and a soldier draping a Viet Cong flag over the palace, was witnessed around the world as the moment that marked the end of the war. That November, the building was renamed Reunification Palace, and it has stood frozen in time ever since. Two of the original tanks are still parked outside. The palace had been designed for General Ngo Dingh Diem, the president of South Vietnam at the time, who was so unpopular with the people that his own air force had bombed his previous palace. The new palace was thus equipped with a reinforced bomb shelter in the basement. The building itself is grand, and rather typical to the architectural style of the 1960s in its plain, concrete simplicity. Complete with an in-house movie theater, library, games room, disco bar, and a helipad on the roof, the palace also boasts an underground section, that is probably the most interesting place to visit. The basement has not only a bomb shelter, commissioned by Diem, but a whole intricate system of tunnels, communication rooms, and command posts, complete with war maps and vintage communications equipment. Needless to say the president never got the chance to enjoy the new digs. He was killed by his own troops a year after the bombings, and three years before the completion of the Reunification Palace.  The palace is open to visitors daily as long as there are no summits or conferences going on at the time. You can buy tickets at the main gate.

It was such an important cultural event that the car that escorted Đức to his fiery death has been preserved at one of Vietnam’s most well-known temples. In itself, Thien Mu Pagoda is an impressive structure. At seven stories high, it is the tallest Pagoda in Vietnam and its construction dates back to 1601 CE. Although the structure and its gardens are beautiful, it sadly lost its luster when it became better known for its involvement in the struggles between Catholics and Buddhists in South Vietnam. Leading up to the 1960s, Catholics were given preferential treatment over Buddhists, and discrimination was institutionalized from the top-down in the government. In 1963, the government massacred nine Buddhists and the situation was at a breaking point. This desperation led Thích Quảng Đức to ride from his temple to Saigon, leave the car at an intersection and set himself on fire. His actions inspired others to follow suit, and discrimination against Buddhists was slowly addressed through protests across Vietnam. Although all that’s left is the rusty blue car, many find the temple an inspiring location and the small car a potent memorial to Đức’s desperate protest.",pagodas sacred spaces

The formation in Vietnam is smaller than the one in Ireland, but is still a sight to behold. Also, the temperatures are much more tolerable. Since 1998, the Gành Đá Dĩa and its estimated 35,000 columns have been listed as a National Heritage site. There are several restaurants and parking areas near the entrance to this site.  There aren’t many sights around this beach, so most visitors come from the tourist town of Quy Nhon, a few hours to the north.

Keep an eye out for the rocks on your left if you’re coming from Quy Nhon, you should see a small sign on the left. Alternatively, you can rent a car, but make sure you negotiate a round trip rate as it will be harder to find a car back to Quy Nhon. There is no beach access by the biggest basalt formation, but there is a public sand beach just a few minutes to the south. Pay for your ticket at the shack (about $3/60,000vnd or maybe less).

The town is almost built around the statue, and the legend of the statue’s origin represents the attitudes of the village. Darahoa is a mixed village community of two minority groups in Vietnam, the Chill and the K’Ho. Although the two groups coexist today without struggle, this was not always the case and according to local tradition, a tragic Romeo and Juliet-esque tale took place many years ago when sparks flew between a Chill woman and a rich and powerful K’Ho hunter. When the couple tried to wed, the man’s father objected to the Chill woman and assigned her a series of tasks, the most difficult of which was finding a rooster with nine spurs and an elephant with nine tusks. As a devoted boyfriend, her soon-to-be husband headed into the woods to find the elusive beast. Days later, she found him dying in the jungle and held him in her arms as he took his last breaths. To reflect the morals of this sad tale, artist Lu Truc Phuong built the giant rooster in 1978. It stands in the center of the town to symbolize harmony and peace in the village between the two groups. The rooster also represents the love the two people had for each other. Aside from representing positive morals, the rooster also sits atop a water pump, that provides water for the entire village, sharing the wealth of the land and embracing people of all walks of life.

The evacuation, dubbed “Operation Frequent Wind,” called for the U.S. Embassy in Saigon to be a secondary evacuation point but the complex was soon overwhelmed by locals and high-ranking South Vietnamese politicians alike, all desperate to flee the country. In all, 7,000 people were airlifted out of South Vietnam in just two days, many of them via the U.S. Embassy. The last to leave were 11 U.S. Marines that had taken up position on the embassy’s roof, after fighting back massive, unruly crowds that had overrun the building’s grounds. The marines were evacuated from the embassy at 7:53 AM on April 30, marking the unceremonious end to America’s involvement in the Vietnam War. The former embassy itself no longer exists. Vietnam handed the building back over to the U.S. in 1995 after the two countries re-established diplomatic relations but the complex was in need of numerous repairs after being neglected for over 20 years. The building was demolished in 1998 and a new Consulate-General was built adjacent to the old embassy.  Today, history buffs can visit the site of what was once the US embassy, and be guided through the history and events that took place at this important location.The rooftop stairway from the original embassy building was salvaged and is now on display at the Gerald R.

88,The Tomb of Lê Văn Duyệt,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",An ornate tomb pays tribute to one of the most influential and cherished military leaders in Vietnam's history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tomb-of-le-van-duyet,"The tomb of Lê Văn Duyệt is a revered religious complex and memorial to a local peasant-turned-prominent general that helped transform Vietnam into the modern, unified country we know today. In the early 1760s, when Lê Văn Duyệt was born, Vietnam was divided into several different small kingdoms, each ruled by individual lords. While the lords technically pledged their loyalty to the figurehead of the reigning Lê Dynasty, in practice they were self-governing kings. This weak, decentralized system led to the overthrow of the Lê Dynasty in the late 1770s in a series of peasant uprisings known as the Tây Sơn Rebellion. As a brilliant military mind, Lê Văn Duyêt was enlisted by future Emperor Gia Long to put down the insurrection, help unite the country and establish the Nguyễn Dynasty, which would rule Vietnam until 1945. Lê Văn Duyệt’s tomb was constructed after his death in 1830 (and renovated in 1937 and 2008), as a way to honor his life and leadership. The complex, which today is treated as a local park and gathering spot, is decorated with elaborate mosaic dragons, ornate woodwork, and adorned with various altars to venerate the simple peasant who rose to become one of Vietnam’s most important military heroes.  The tomb is free and open to the public. It is, however, an important religious complex, so it is advised that all visitors be respectful when visiting.",

Vietnam’s Muslim community makes up less than 1 percent of the population, so visiting a mosque while in Vietnam may not jump to the top of your “must-do” list. But the Chợ Lớn Mosque offers a beautiful contrast from the overwhelming rush of colors, scents, and sounds that come from other nearby religious sites, as well as a short history lesson about one of the country’s oldest religious minorities. Built in 1932 by Vietnam’s Tamil Muslims, the Chợ Lớn Mosque now serves the largely Malaysian and Indonesian Muslims that call Ho Chi Minh City home. The mosque is a study in simple design, painted in soothing blues and greens. While there are no Western guidebooks inside the mosque, English is spoken and visitors of all faiths are welcome to stop by for a visit and marvel at the architecture.  Chợ Lớn Mosque is situated in the midst of Chợ Lớn, in the Chinatown area and is typically open to visitors every day of the week. Please remember to wear proper attire and remove your shoes before entering. Also, try visiting in the early afternoon or late evening so you can dine at the halal restaurant located inside.",

This event became known as the My Lai Massacre. The official purpose of this operation was to kill Viet Cong soldiers who were supposedly hiding in the area. Following on the orders of Captain Ernest Medina, soldiers entered the village of Sơn Mỹ and started shooting men, women, and children. Animals were also killed and the village’s wells were polluted. People were even killed while praying inside the local temple. It’s estimated that more than 500 Vietnamese civilians were killed during the tragedy. Knowledge of the massacre wasn’t made public until well over a year later and opened more eyes to the horrors of the war. The majority of those involved in the event were either never judged, acquitted, or received light sentences. Captain Ernest Medina was acquitted after being court-martialed for war crimes and ended up living a peaceful life until his death in 2018. The memorial was built 10 years later in the village of Tịnh Khê in 1978.  The memorial is located in the town of Tịnh Khê, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of the city of Da Nang.",war memorial war history military statues history & culture

Down a dirt road and past the Institute of Scientific Research, one will eventually come across a small building where you can purchase tickets to enter Da Lat’s very own Biological Museum (Bảo tàng Sinh học Đà Lạt). The museum consists of 2,500 square meters of exhibition space in a three-story building. The stone building is mostly empty save a small cafe, chocolate shop, and the museum, which is on the second floor past a lot of locked doors and piles of furniture in the dark halls. The rooms on the second floor are filled with collections that make some sense at first. Fungi, insects, and birds fill the first few rooms. The specimens have labels on them with their Vietnamese name, the donor and the year. Some of them date as far back as the the early 18th century. Some of these show their age, bulging in some places and wires exposed in others. As you move into the other rooms, things start to seem strange. Satellites, an elephant, rabbits, a house cat, a sea turtle, and a two-headed pig in formaldehyde are in the main exhibit room. The final rooms hold hundreds of skeletons and other creatures from a diverse range of habitats. The tigers have velvet tongues, but one is missing its lower jaw. It’s unclear which specimens came from Vietnam as there is almost no information in the museum except to identify the name of the animal.",science museums museums and collections
92,Statue of Lenin,"Hanoi, Vietnam","A gift from the Soviet Union in the 1980s, this is the only statue of the Soviet dictator in Southeast Asia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/statue-of-lenin-hanoi,"An unexpected sight in the center of the Vietnamese capital, this statue of Vladimir Lenin, the work of Soviet sculptor Alexander Tyurenkov, was a gift from the USSR to the people of Vietnam. The 5.2-meter (18-foot) bronze figure was first erected in 1980 in Thong Nhat Park to celebrate what would have been Lenin’s 110th birthday. It was moved to its current location in 1982 and the area was renamed Lenin Park, a small but pleasant green space in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Hanoi. Lenin and Ho Chi Minh met in 1922, and the statue symbolizes the influence of Leninism on Ho Chi Minh and Vietnamese politics in general. In a movement that has been growing since the end of World War II, statues and portraits of Lenin have been removed and demolished in many places. The likenesses became symbols of the violence and oppression of the Soviet Union. But images of Lenin can still be seen every now and then in Vietnam, although they are not as common as they once were. Viacheslav Dukhin, a counselor at the Russian embassy in Hanoi once said about the statue, “Certainly it’s funny. There must be other instances where someone is recognized abroad as a hero but not at home. Maybe Jesus Christ.” A popular joke in Hanoi is that the statue was built with one hand in its pocket to symbolize that “the Russians are so cheap.” Today, the park is a meeting point for locals and is often frequented by young skateboarders, badminton players, Tai Chi enthusiasts, and others.  The statue is located in front of the Museum of Military History, about 10 minutes walk from the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.

When Ho Chi Minh declared independence against the French in 1945, she was only 12 years old. A few years later, she joined the Viet Minh and became a guerilla fighter. At the age of 14 while in a busy market, she tossed a grenade at a group of French soldiers. She managed to kill one officer and injure several others. She was able to escape undetected. At 16, she planned another grenade attack, however, the grenade failed to detonate and she was apprehended by the French authorities. She was then shipped off to three different prisons, the final being Con Son prison on the Con Dao archipelago. She was executed by firing squad in 1952. She was only 19-years-old. It’s said she refused to be blindfolded and stared into the eyes of the soldiers while singing until she was killed. Today, she is considered a national hero and a symbol of the revolutionary spirit. Her grave is frequently visited by Vietnamese citizens, especially at night, to honor her memory. Many streets, parks, and schools are named after her across Vietnam.  The grave is located in the Hang Duong Cemetery not far from the prison were she was executed. Ceremonies around her grave usually take place around midnight.",revolution graves burial places history & culture

95,Kingdom of Redonda,Antigua and Barbuda,A hotly contested micro-nation off the coast of Montserrat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kingdom-of-redonda,"It would be ideal to have hard evidence about the history of Redonda. But unfortunately, reality and legend have blurred over the last 150 years, and now the world is left to deal with an island micro-nation, playing host to conflicting claims to a throne that may or may not be legitimate. According to his progeny, the Kingdom of Redonda was founded by Matthew Dowdy Shiell and was done so in a legal manner. In 1865, Shiell, who had noticed a seemingly unclaimed and unpopulated island in the Caribbean near Montserrat, put forth a petition to Queen Victoria to become king of the Island. The Queen consented, and a line of kings was created. Shiell’s son, a science fiction writer, took his kingship and ran with it, spreading the word about Redonda in pamphlets that many took as complete fiction. Shiell’s son may have done irreparable damage to the legitimacy of the island by simply being involved, but nonetheless, Redonda’s notoriety spread. When Shiell’s son died, he left the island and title of king to a man named John Gawsworth, who changed the history of the island forever. Often penniless, Gawsworth was known to sell the title of king multiple times. While this did well to fatten his pocketbook, Gawsworth also appointed multiple monarchs, settting up for huge Redonda drama in the 20th century. In 2007, the last man to claim the title of King of Redonda renounced his claim to the BBC. However, Redonda was not yet out of the news. Later in 2007, a pub in England claimed to be an embassy of Redonda to gain diplomatic immunity from a smoking ban. The last sources on the conflict state that the pub’s owner was in fact given knighthood by the latest king of Redonda.",micro-nations

He became prime minister in 1981 and held that position until 1994. During that time, Bird took the twin-island nation from a British colony to an independent nation. Bird is seen by many as the father of the nation, and homages to him can be found all over the island of Antigua (the international airport for example was renamed in his honor).  However, none are as bright or have such a prominent placement as the VC Bird Monument. This brightly colored bust of VC Bird occupies a prime position in downtown St John’s next to the public market. The monument, designed and sculpted by the Cuban artist, Andres Gonzalez, was installed in 2002, just three years after Bird’s death. The statue stands 10 meters (33 feet) tall, and depicts a besuited middle-aged Bird (who himself was 2.1 meters or seven feet tall) with his hand on his chest. Next to him is a black pineapple, a type of fruit that is said to be a delicacy and unique to the island. Getting a close up of the monument is a challenge: its situated in a small triangular at the intersection of two busy roads.

These adorable equines were brought to the island as beasts of burden during the colonial era and then, when their usefulness came to an end, they were released to fend for themselves. They thrived in packs until overpopulation made them a nuisance. Many of the “wild” donkeys were shot, fed to visiting circus animals and hit by cars. On top of that, their population was decimated by disease, and they nearly died out. However, in the mid-twentieth century, a movement began to save the Aruban donkeys, and today the humble non-profit sanctuary provides food, shelter, and medical care to almost two hundred animals. Visitors can feed and pet the donkeys, and locals are encouraged to adopt them. Take route 4A from the hotels. At the Pizza Hut in Paradera take a left turn.

Constructed in 1872 by the London-based Aruba Island Gold Mining Company, the stamp mill harnessed the power of strong ocean winds to crush stone and isolate gold ore. A smelter on site processed the ore into fine gold, which was driven to a nearby harbor for export. The mill operated for a decade, refining more than 2,000 ounces of gold before production halted in 1883 (likely due to the high cost of operation). It was reopened in 1889 by another British company, the Aruba Agency Company. This operation also lasted for a decade and the Bushiribana mill was permanently closed in 1899 as attention shifted to a newer, state-of-the-art mill at Balashi, in Aruba’s interior. After more than a century of vacancy, only the natural stone walls of the Bushiribana Gold Mill remain. Visitors to the ruins can walk freely throughout the abandoned structure and can carefully climb the remnants of a staircase on the mill’s southern wall to enjoy sweeping views of the Caribbean. The Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins are a frequent stop on numerous ATV and off-road vehicle tours of Aruba’s northeastern coast.",gold mining ruins

On this small, uninhabited island, there’s a group of feral pigs. The pigs are regularly fed by those who go out to visit them, which is often those staying at Fowl Cay Resort, where boats are available and all the regulars direct visitors to the pigs because they never cease to amaze. If you are offshore in a boat, the pigs will swim out to you. But beware: If you get too shallow (like three feet of water or so), the pigs can—and probably will—jump into your boat and look for your lunch. But that’s only if they’re feeling especially friendly. The pigs control the island, roaming on their own terms, but they prefer to stay in the shade during the sunny hours, venturing onto the beach and into the waters when it cools down a bit. It’s unclear how the pigs got there, some believing they survived a shipwreck, others say that sailors left them there for a future meal and never returned. Recently, up to 10 of the Bahamas’ swimming pigs were found dead. Though initial reports suggested that tourists had given the pigs fatal doses of alcohol, Humane Society inspector Ventoi Bethune told National Geographic that the dead swine had likely ingested sand. Another theory was that this was brought about by the unusually dry January. Veterinarians who visited the site found large quantities of sand in the deceased animals’ stomachs, which Bethune says may have been caused by a recent influx of visitors throwing small amounts of food on the beach.  From Nassau, take a plane to Staniel Cay. Rent a boat from the Staniel Cay Yacht Club and go north about a mile. It is also possible to flight directly from the USA to George Town (Great Exuma) and go from there directly by boat. You can also fly from Fort Lauderdale to Staniel Cay with Watermarkers Air. Another option is to take a day trip from Nassau.

A blue hole is a term that is often given to sinkholes that are filled with water, while the entrance to them is located beneath the surface. While most other known blue holes only reach maximum depths of 360 feet, the 663 foot depth of Dean’s Blue Hole makes it quite exceptional. At the surface, Dean’s Blue Hole is roughly circular with a diameter ranging from 82-115 feet (25-35 meters). After one descends 66 feet below the surface, the hole widens considerably into a cavern with a diameter of 330 feet (100 meters). The water at Dean’s Blue Hole is extremely clear and on good days the visibility can reach 115 feet. In April 2010, professional diver William Trubridge broke a free-diving world record in the blue hole by reaching a depth of 302 feet (92 meters) without the use of fins. He took that even further when on December 14, 2010, he swam to a depth of 331 feet (101 meters) on a single breath while using only his hands and feet for propulsion.

Bottom feeders, nurse sharks mostly appear to sit down on the bottom of the shallows and suck sediment and little critters from the sand. If you are underwater near them, you can hear them squeal a high-pitched sound. While they may be benign and catfish-like, the reality is that they look like a shark. They have a dorsal fin. They are big. Did we mention the dorsal fin, that sign so often associated with the terrifying man-eating monsters of the sea ever since Spielberg focused his attention on a young Richard Dreyfuss and that small town’s celebration of the Fourth of July near the sea? At Compass Cay, which is a private island in the Outer Exumas, just south of the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park, the marina workers feed the fish. This makes them very friendly animals; they’re not likely to expend the extra effort to gnaw off a leg when they know that they’re going to get something much better hand-fed to them. They have names. They swim up to you. They are photogenic. Please be aware that they can, and will bite, if they feel menaced.

Entitled Ocean Atlas, the installation encourages coral colonization and deters tourists from endangered reefs. Forged from sustainable, pH-neutral materials designed to kickstart local coral growth, Ocean Atlas is a monumental public sculpture submerged five meters beneath the sea, and an environmental gesture intended to portray the positive potential of human interaction with the natural world. Located off the west coast of New Providence in Nassau, Ocean Atlas is Taylor’s contemporary take on the ancient Greek myth of Atlas—a Titan condemned to carry the heavens on his back for eternity. Rather, Ocean Atlas, commissioned by BREEF (Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation), is a young Bahamian girl “sustaining the ceiling of the ocean,” Taylor’s website explains, as “our oceans and coral reefs currently [face] collapse from numerous threats including overfishing, habitat loss, ocean acidification, global warming and water pollution…” Taylor founded the world’s first underwater sculpture park in Grenada’s Molinere Bay in 2006. The project, entitled Viccisitudes, was inaugurated with 16 statues of local Grenadian women. The installation is now comprised of 75 sculptures—each depicting a real person—sprawling over 800 square meters. Taylor has since designed two more submerged museums: MUSA (Museo Subacuático de Arte) in Cancun, billed on his website as “one of the largest and most ambitious underwater artificial art attractions in the world,” with over 500 permanent sculptures forged to scale; and Museo Atlántico, the first submerged contemporary art museum in the Atlantic Ocean, based off the coast of Lanzarote, Spain.

103,Bimini Road,"North Bimini Island, Bahamas",An underwater road considered a possible Atlantis location.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bimini-road,"According to Greek legend, the city of Atlantis sunk into the ocean in one single day, wiping its existence off the earth 11,000 years ago. Since that time, scientists, treasure hunters and philosophers have searched endlessly to find even a trace of the lost world, said to be partially intact somewhere below the ocean waves. Being one of the most well-known legends in the world, anything found during an ocean dive even resembling a manmade structure has caused serious waves of media attention. In 1968, a diver off the coast of North Bimini Island, Bahamas discovered a series of stones 18 feet below the surface. The stones appeared manmade, and were evenly spaced out in a road-like line stretching a half mile. A storm of publicity immediately descended on the discovery, with a number of individuals claiming the stones were a portion of wall, or a road that was formerly part of a larger city. Everyone hoped the discovery would be connected to Atlantis, and the discovery of two other similar “roads,” spurred the excitement. Unfortunately, carbon dating, and analysis of the blocks led to the conclusion that the roads were made naturally through geological forces. No tool marks were found on the blocks, and there was no evidence that the blocks had ever been stacked to build a structure. Although there is still some speculation and research on Bimini today, it is generally agreed upon that the limestone blocks were formed by erosion, leaving the mystery of Atlantis unsolved.",atlantis lost cities underwater week lost tribes hoaxes and pseudoscience cultures and civilizations
104,Subsurface Bahamian Caves,"Andros I, Bahamas",Inhospitable caverns just beneath this island paradise offer insights into alien worlds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/subsurface-bahamian-caves,"One can picture extraterrestrial researchers doing any number of things. Scanning starry nights with a telescope. Listening for radio signals beamed from other worlds with skyscraper-sized antennas. Unraveling government conspiracies alongside a skeptical redhead. Yet somehow, scuba diving doesn’t spring to mind. But that’s exactly what regularly brings researchers to the Bahamas, where just below the turquoise water and balmy sea breezes that make visitors lament not being able to stay forever, one of the harshest environments on the planet exists. “Blue Holes,” as they are often called due to the small circle of water they form in the inland soil (and their similarities to the more well-known offshore variety), sometimes form the entrance to a vast network of underground caverns. The caverns are completely submerged and contain zero or near-zero percent oxygen – and that’s just the first of their remarkable traits. Scientists looking to gain an understanding of what life might be like on planets other than Earth have very few resources to turn to. The planet they live on happens to be nearly 100% Earth, and the alternate environments they have some access to (the moon, Mars) happen to, thus far, have zero life forms. So they turn to some of Earth’s least hospitable environments to see what’s going on there. Research takes them from the cracked desert floor of the Mojave to the North Pole and the sub-freezing water beneath it – anyplace, really, where nothing might turn into something. But the caves in the Bahamas have something those other places don’t: diversity. Zero light and an underwater environment have created some interesting life forms in other places, but the unique combination of reduced gravitational effects and a saltwater-rich environment largely shielded from external forces have created a fascinating incubator for the growth of microorganisms. And perhaps more importantly, a lack of others – the bacteria that usually cause trouble for terrestrial environments have a hard time growing here, and if they do, it’s in a unique way that results in a high volume of deadly hydrogen sulfide. The caves can be an archeologist’s fantasy as well, as the lack of oxygen and bacteria have resulted in some remarkably well-preserved bones and artifacts. But the environment isn’t well explored because it’s highly dangerous and unpredictable. Nearly impenetrable by casual exploration, only highly skilled divers or submersible robots can really delve into the caverns, and if the lack of oxygen and seemingly endless space weren’t problem enough, hydrogen sulfide reaches lethal levels not far below the water’s surface. The Bahamas’ inland blue holes are not the place for a vacation – that much is clear. But for scientists and adventure seekers alike, they do represent a sort of El Dorado, offering a wealth of hidden secrets that have barely been seen or examined to this point.",underwater week subterranean sites caves ecosystems water

In the 1800s, the massive, 65-step staircase was named in honor of Queen Victoria, who had signed a declaration abolishing slavery on her ascension to the throne in 1837 before reigning for 64 years. The 700-island archipelago of the Bahamas is today an independent Commonwealth, having separated from the United Kingdom in 1973, but still nominally ruled by the British monarch.

Still called the Glass Window Bridge, it’s a vulnerable spot that has been destroyed and rebuilt many times in the intervening 130 years. Often called the “Narrowest Place on Earth”, the bridge today still provides a view of the stunning contrast between the Atlantic and Bight of Eleuthera’s distinct natures. Occasionally, when a strong wave washes over the rocks, for a brief moment that separation disappears, and the two bodies of water shake hands.  Queen's Highway runs the length of Eleuthera, a skinny island only a mile wide in some spots, and 110 miles long. The Glass Window Bridge connects the north island to the south, and you can get there by car or bike.Be aware of the force of the waves from the Atlantic side, which can hit unexpectedly and with some force.

108,The Musician,Bahamas,A full-scale sculpture of a mermaid and baby grand piano hidden underwater by David Copperfield.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-musician-bahamas,"A strange surprise waits beneath the waves for snorkelers splashing through the waters around magician David Copperfield’s private islands. Just off the coast of Rudder Cut Cay, swimmers will find a life-sized sculpture of a mermaid lounging atop the sandy ocean floor. The mermaid waits near the bench of a baby grand piano as if beckoning divers to sit down and play her a tune. The stainless steel sculpture is hidden about 12 to 15 feet below the surface and can be a bit difficult to spot when the current stirs up the sand and clouds the water. It makes discovering them on a clear day feel all the more magical. Snorkelers capable of holding their breath for a while like to swim down and pose atop the bench as if they, too, belong in this underwater world. Copperfield, who owns multiple private islands within the Bahamas, commissioned the artwork from Jason DeCaires Taylor and had it sunk as a quirky surprise for the few, exclusive guests who stay on the private island or those who take boat trips to snorkel off the shore.",mermaids underwater sculptures statues
109,Great Isaac Cay,Bahamas,"Bermuda triangle lighthouse, site of mysterious disappearances, left to crumble into the Atlantic.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-isaac-cay,"Erected in the 1850s to prevent merchant ships from disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle, the 152-foot tall Great Isaac Lighthouse has become more of a participant in the area’s mysteries than a protector. The cay itself is one giant coral head - a colony of genetically identical coral polyps - rising a few feet out of the area’s shallow, dangerous reefs. Razor sharp terrain makes the land inhospitable and difficult to traverse. For over a century the barren island was occupied by lighthouse keepers, but on August 4, 1969, it was discovered that the caretakers had gone missing. Their bodies were never found, and while it’s anyone’s guess as to what may have happened, a hurricane that passed through a few days prior is thought to be the likeliest culprit. After their disappearance, the Great Isaac Light was automated, shining a white beam every 15 seconds to sailors up to 23 nautical miles away. The rest of the compound’s buildings have been left to crumble. Adding to the island’s macabre history, 19th century lore has it that a ship wrecked on Great Isaac Cay, killing everyone aboard except one young infant. Locals claim that the infant’s mother (known as the Grey Lady) can still be seen roaming the island, and her wails of sorrow can be heard on full moons. Though the cay’s grounds are open to the public, the bottom few stairs in the tower are missing, and the storage bunkers and buildings are locked. Exploring is expected and part of the fun, though falling on the rocks or cutting yourself while shimmying up the lighthouse’s rusty staircase are both real possibilities and may earn you a fresh tetanus shot. Moderate agility and seafaring skill is required to make landfall.  Located 20 nautical miles North of the Bimini Islands. You'll need a boat and a map to get there on your own.

110,Primeval Forest National Park,"Nassau, Bahamas",Impressive sink holes fill this untouched old-growth forest in the Bahamas.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/primeval-forest-national-park,"The Primeval Forest National Park is a geological and botanical gem, tucked away in the bustling, commercial capital of the Bahamas. The ancient hardwood forest, which is largely untouched by humans, is one of the best preserved plots of old-growth woodland in the country. From the early 1700s up into the 1970s, the logging industry within the Bahamas led to the mass exploitation of large hardwood trees. A shift in logging licenses, plus an increased awareness of the environmental importance of living, standing trees, finally slowed the culling. Pericles Maillis, the former president of the British National Trust, stumbled upon the undisturbed patch of forest that would one day become the Primeval Forest National Park as a boy. In the late ’90s, he led the initiative to protect the land. It’s a small park, only about 7.5 acres in total, but it serves as a mini time capsule of Nassau’s former evergreen, tropical environment. The forest is filled with an array of pines, hemlocks, mosses, termite mounds, and even a fossilized conch shell. But the star attraction is the sinkholes. The impressive limestone caverns, some of which are up to 50 feet long and 30 feet deep, are scattered throughout the park. The sinkholes occur because of the abundance of water that causes the limestone, a highly porous rock, to weather. They’re easily accessed via a series of boardwalks, steps, and bridges. The park, which also has a small visitor’s center full of geological facts, was established in 2002.  Park hours are limited, so be sure it will be open when you go.",sinkhole preservation flora forests trees ancient ecosystems plants nature

The SS Sapona never had a chance to live up to her potential. Built by the Liberty Ship Building Company, she wasn’t finished by the time the war ended, and was sold for scrap before getting a chance to sail. Moved to Bimini by new owner Bruce Bethel, the ship served her first real purpose - as a sneaky storage spot to stash booze in during the prohibition. Bethel had wild fantasies of turning the vessel into a floating nightclub, but alas, that glamorous plan was never meant to be, and the ship ran aground and was broken into pieces by a hurricane in 1926. After suffering the indignity of becoming target practice for US forces during WWII, and slowly disintegrating as time and weather took their toll, the SS Sapona has broken apart and settled in. Submerged in about 15 ft. of water, the rusty remains serve as a quiet, serene playground for local fish and the humans who snorkel and dive among them.",disaster areas shipwrecks water
112,Dolphin House Museum,"Alice Town, Bahamas",One man's love of sea life and art has turned his home into a temple of outsider island art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dolphin-house,"Ashley Saunders, a local author, artist, historian and retired teacher on the island of Bimini has opened his home, the Dolphin House Museum, to visitors who can take in his chaotic mosaics that act as homages to his island’s history. Saunders whose family has lived on Bimini since the American Revolution has built a unique house and a landmark tourist attraction.  In 1993, he began construction of a house unlike any other using found and recycled materials to decorate every inch of the concrete structure.  The Dolphin House in Alice Town (North Bimini) is a thick and sturdy building, purpose-designed to withstand the ugly forces of passing hurricanes, yet also embellished by the careful touches of an artist.  The interior and exterior walls are completely covered in mosaics composed of colorful tiles, shells, bottles, coins, and all manner of other found objects. He has used materials from demolition sites and shoreline cast-offs from various places. Saunders warmly invites any and all guests to see his home and learn not only about his unique artistic vision but also of the history of the Bahamas island he loves so much.  The intense love he has for his island home motivated him to write two volumes of the History of Bimini and four books of island poetry. Mr. Saunders considers himself a dolphin inspired artist who tells a story of swimming with a large pod of wild Bimini dolphins and attributes his artistic vision to that inspirational experience. “The dolphins touched my heart and made me an artist.” - Ashley Saunders",outsider art islands
113,The Cow and the Bull,Bahamas,These two giant boulders mysteriously perched on a 60-foot cliff may have been slung up there by a raging tsunami.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-cow-and-the-bull-bahamas,"Two enormous limestone boulders are perched at the edge of a cliff, on a rocky surface 60 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. They formed on the ocean floor anywhere from 300,000 to 400,000 years ago. So how did they get up there? The rocks, known locally as the Cow and the Bull, are part of a mysterious series of giant boulders on the coast of Eleuthera island in the Bahamas. Seven massive rocks form an almost perfect line along an especially narrow portion of the 110-mile coastline. The “Cow” and the “Bull” weigh 1,000 and 2,000 tons respectively and are each over 20 feet tall. Some scientists believe the massive boulders may have been lifted to the clifftop millennia ago by a powerful tsunami caused by the changing climate. Bahamians refer to the area’s massive waves—powerful enough that they have displaced the concrete slabs of a road just north of the boulders—as “rages.” James Hansen, a retired NASA scientist, believes those waves were even more powerful 100,000 years ago during catastrophic superstorms produced by a warming period known as the Eemian. The oceans rose a great deal towards the end of the Eemian, and Hansen theorizes it was during that time tsunamis slung the boulders up onto the cliff. The informative placards for visitors concur, claiming the ocean “lifted them atop the ridge.” There is contention, however, among scientists. Hansen is often referred to as “the father of global climate change awareness,” and his opposition believes his explanation is just a ploy to bring more attention to the issue. Hansen’s claim isn’t unprecedented, though; a recent study in the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Africa claims boulders up to 700 tons were lifted more than 900 feet by tsunamis some 73,000 years ago. Some believe the boulders were simply left there after the surrounding rocks eroded to nothing, but that neglects the age of the boulders and the much younger surface below. Regardless of the specifics, something dramatic happened to the landscape so many years ago.",environment climate change rock formations oceans rocks geological oddities geology
114,Cape Eleuthera Resort Ruins,"South Eleuthera, Bahamas",A paradise hotel turned from opulent to overgrown.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cape-eleuthera-resort-ruins,"Welcome to paradise lost. Located at the southern terminus of Queen’s Highway, on the quiet shoestring-shaped island of Eleuthera, lie the ruins of a decadent era. Opened in 1972, the Cape Eleuthera Resort hosted well-heeled jet-setters during the island’s tourism heyday. Built in conjunction with former Pan Am founder Juan Trippe, who set up a small, now derelict airport nearby, the former resort was an excuse to day-trip from Florida for a round of golf and business luncheons. Described in an advertisement as a “world of beauty on the island of Eleuthera,” the short-lived opulence of the resort ended in 1983 with bankruptcy, followed by a fire and repeated pummeling by hurricanes that pushed the property to disrepair allowing nature to begin reclamation. Included at this site of prime exploration are the ruins of old villas and the former clubhouse, with its palm tree-lined circular driveway and valet parking. Long gone are the tennis courts, manicured beaches, tiled pool, and 18-hole golf course—all of which have been swallowed up by the hungry Bahamian flora. The once manicured network of golf cart roads still exists, albeit pockmarked with potholes and overgrown with vines and invasive Casuarina pines. This jungled landscape is prime for exploration, made up of concentric paths known as the “Outer Loop” and the “Inner Loop,” which houses a ghostly and colossal banyan tree. Today the site lies adjacent to a quaint modern marina with a handful of pastel houses, a milder glimpse into the lavish extravagance of tropical holidays past. Those adventuring to the verdant site can navigate to the predominantly intact “4th Hole,” a fairway that lies adjacent to a secluded beach kissed by azure waves, just one of many natural nooks that make this area prime for fishing, running, and snorkeling.  This site lies at the end of Queen's Highway, past The Island School and adjacent to the rebuilt Cape Eleuthera Resort & Marina. Open to the public, this location is prime for nature exploration, therefore, travelers should dress accordingly.",tropical resorts hotels abandoned architecture

116,Preacher’s Cave,Bahamas,The site of the earliest colonial settlement in the Bahamas started as a place of religious refuge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/preacher-s-cave,"While the English Civil War raged an ocean away from the Caribbean, the conflict had an unexpected effect on the expansion of Britain’s colonial empire: the settlement of the Bahamas. In 1646, a cohort of approximately 70 Puritans fled Bermuda to avoid persecution from the island’s Episcopal-Royalists. This group of religious refugees, led by Bermuda’s former governor and Oliver Cromwell loyalist, William Sayle, would eventually become known as the “Eleutheran Adventurers.” At some point during the voyage, the Adventurers’ ship encountered severe weather, causing it to hit the Devil’s Backbone Reef off of the Bahamian island now known as Eleuthera. William was able to lead survivors of the shipwreck to shelter in a nearby cave, where the Adventurers created a permanent settlement. Still visible to visitors today, the settlers hewed a pulpit from a rock formation within the cave, giving the area its name, Preacher’s Cave. The Preacher’s Cave colony was able to survive due to the support of New England Puritan communities in the American colonies, who after hearing about the plight of the Adventurers, sent provisions to Eleuthera. Grateful for their assistance, the Preacher’s Cave community sent 10 tons of valuable Brazilwood back to their patrons, stipulating that the proceeds from the selling of the wood be donated to Harvard University. As for Sayle, he would eventually move to South Carolina in 1669, found the city of Charleston, and become the first governor of South Carolina the following year. Preacher’s Cave was the first British settlement of the Bahamas, but the island of Eleuthera and the cave itself were inhabited long before the arrival of William Sayle and the Puritans. Several recent archaeological excavations at Preacher’s Cave yielded not only the skeletal remains of some of the Eleutheran Adventurers, but also those of the indigenous Lucayan-Taíno Indians. In some cases, the remains of the Lucayan individuals predate the Preacher’s Cave settlement by several centuries.  Pristine Tay Bay Beach is visible from Preacher's Cave and is easily accessible from the site. Locals and tourists alike often end a trip to the cave by visiting the beach.",shipwrecks colonialism caves religion ecosystems sacred spaces history
117,Project HARP Space Gun,Barbados,A giant gun barrel in Barbados that once hoped to shoot outer space with science.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/project-harp-space-gun-barbados,"Not to be confused with the conspiracy factory known as Project HAARP (High-Frequency Active Aural Research Program), Project HARP (High Altitude Research Project) was a joint initiative between the United States and Canada  to research the use of ballistics to deliver objects into the upper atmosphere and beyond. In lay terms, the HARP project was established to create a cartoonishly large gun to shoot things into space. Designed by mad ballistics engineer Gerald Bull, the gun itself was originally built from a 65-foot long, 16” naval cannon, the kind that might be seen on a battleship. The cannon was later joined to another barrel, extending the length of the gun to 130 feet and making it too big for effective military application, but (seemingly) perfect for satellite delivery. The titanic gun was not designed for delivering human subjects, but instead, the cannon fired smaller projectiles in a sabot that would protect the payload during the firing and would fall away as the satellite rose. At its apex, the gun was able to fire an object a staggering 112 miles into the sky, setting the 1963 world record for gun-launched altitude at 93 KM. As the project continued, similar guns were built in locations across the United States, however, the sole surviving fruit of the project is the massive, toppled gun barrel at the Barbados test site. The Barbados gun was abandoned in the late 1960s and left to rust on its original launch site and after years of neglect looks more like a painted sewer pipe than a Godzilla-size gun barrel. Please note that the gun is located on an active military base and is only accessible with permission.  If you really want to do it the right way, contact the military base a couple of months before you go and get their written permission. UPDATE August 2014 : The cannon is now almost totally disappearing under the bushes, and the rust is eating it fast. UPDATE May 2017:  The longer cannon is still easily visible, the secondary one is now hidden in the undergrowth about 10m to the NE of the larger one, sections of its barrel are just visible. Not an easy place to reach, actually (4x4 advised...) It's a ten minutes drive from the Airport. Go East when leaving the Airport, pass by the Concorde Experience warehouse, keep going on the main road (direction : Saint Martins). Then turn right to Gemswick (the turn is in front of a nice park with bended trees), then left (natural curve of the road), then take the first right, straight down, then left again. Take the unpaved path on the right just BEFORE the bar. Keep going until you reach the cliffs. If you have a 4x4 you can try your luck at the narrow path going down to the meadows, then turn right (West) along the cliffs. Otherwise, you can park and continue on foot (10 minutes walk). The cannon is located just underneath the Airport zone about 700m from the bottom of the path down from the houses.",retro-tech space exploration science ruins

Accessible by a set of steep coral steps, the cave boasts breathtaking views of a wild ocean landscape whose colors change at the whim of the intermingling clouds and sunshine. The cave gets its name from the sea anemones, what Barbadians call “animal flowers,” that live in the cave’s shallower pools. Named after the anemone flower, the sea anemone looks like a blooming underwater plant but acts like an animal. When it senses approaching predators, it retracts its petal-like tentacles into its trunk and all but disappears. During the winter, visitors can see the spouts and tails of humpback whales cavorting and fishing in the deep waters. The cave’s soundscape boasts the haunting echoes of waves crashing upon the cave’s rocky entrances. With every wave, water flows in and refreshes the pools of water dotting the floor. Visitors are permitted to swim in one of the cave’s deeper pools and frolic upon the rocks that bear the ocean’s rage.  Cave tours are offered every 10 to 15 minutes and are led by a local guide; visitors have the option to swim inside the cave. In addition to the cave, there are several above-ground attractions including a cliffside restaurant overlooking the ocean, a playground, a lookout point for spotting whales and birds, and a snack bar and lounge area. The easiest way to get to the cave is by private car. The cave is also accessible via public transportation. Take a bus or van to the Speightstown bus station and then ask around until you find the van that goes by the cave.

Originally charted in 1795 by local explorers, the caves, despite their rich geologic variety and beauty were left virtually unexplored for nearly 180 years. In 1974, an enterprising caver named Ole Sorenson was commissioned to map out the caverns, and he instantly saw the potential for exploitation. Thanks to the calcium-rich water running down the cave walls and dripping from the ceiling, countless unique geologic formations had grown in the depths of the cave. Work began to excavate new tunnels and divert underground streams to turn the eye-popping rock formations into a more tourist-friendly spelunk. Harrison’s Cave, set in the island’s center in St. Thomas, is named for Thomas Harrison, a prominent 18th-century landowner. This site was opened for business in 1981 and visitors can now take tram rides through the caves, experiencing the carefully groomed wonders of nature.

The vault was originally built in 1724 but was purchased by the Chase family when Mary Ann Chase died at the tender age of 2. The little girl was placed in the vault in a lead coffin along with the vault’s single other occupant who was interred in a wooden coffin. Just a few short years later Mary Ann’s sister Dorcas was also buried in the tomb after starving herself to death. Death continued to plague the Chase family when the sisters’ father Thomas died around a month after his eldest daughter. However, when the thick marble slab that sealed the entrance to the vault was removed, the burial team discovered that the three coffins inside had been violently tossed around and were standing against the walls of the tomb in seeming disarray. There was no evidence of human tampering with the sealed vault, and none of the other vaults in the cemetery had been affected in the same way, eliminating the possibility of earthquake or flood. Regardless, all of the coffins were placed back in their original places and Thomas’ was added to the orderly pile. Years later when the vault was once again opened to add another body to the pile, they found the coffins had been tossed around once again and were lying all about the vault. This time, before resealing the seemingly watertight and impenetrable space, a layer of sand was placed on the floor to detect any footprints should the culprits return again. After a couple of years, with the story percolating among the public, the vault was reopened to check on things, and as the story goes, it was revealed in front of throngs of curious onlookers that the coffins had once again been moved around. At this point, all of the coffins were removed from the vault and reburied elsewhere in the cemetery. The empty vault remains open to this day, filled only with ghost stories. However with no coffins to toss around, any malevolent spirit (or committed prankster) may have a hard time making themselves known.",haunted tombs

This marks the spot where international aviation history began in Barbados. Barbados’ first international arrival came by way of an Avro Avian. On March 29, 1929, British aviator Bill Lancaster flew the aircraft from Guadeloupe to the Rockley Golf and Country Club where the plane touched down. The golf club also happens to be the oldest on the island dating back to 1910. Lancaster was already a celebrity before the flight, having flown with companion Chubbie Miller from England to Australia, making her the first woman to do so. Lancaster’s later life was marred by scandal and tragedy. He was acquitted of killing Miller’s new lover, before crash-landing in Algeria attempting to break the speed record traveling from England to South Africa. His log confirms that he remained alive for at least eight days, but his remains were not discovered until 1962, when French troops came across his mummified body and the crash site.  There is space to walk down the right hand side of the fifth hole, without interfering with players.

In the 1800s St. Peter’s Church in St. George, Bermuda was severely damaged by a storm. The damage was so devastating that the decision was made to build a brand new church as opposed to even attempting to repair the original. Thus work on the Unfinished Church began in 1874, although it would never finish. Almost immediately, the funding for the project became an issue as there was just not that much to support the project. This led to a decision to turn the funds towards repairing the old church instead, making the new construction obsolete before it was even finished. The project was essentially abandoned despite being a great deal complete and would possibly have been picked up again were it not for a 1926 storm that destroyed a large portion of the work that had been done. St. Peter’s was restored and is now the oldest Anglican church in the New World, but the Unfinished Church still sits, much as the name describes, unfinished. The structure has been crumbling for over a hundred years but is now a well-tended national landmark, albeit one that is totally unsafe. In fact the interior of the church is now closed to visitors due to safety concerns, although the exterior of this almost-was holy house can still be visited.

Or, at least something that resembles one, thanks to a unique geological phenomenon. One of the highlights of Bermuda’s largest nature reserve is its rocky shore. A series of lines eroded into the limestone is a particularly peculiar attraction. Locals dubbed it “the Checkerboard” because of its familiar criss-crossing appearance. The lines are actually a rare geological phenomenon called tessellated pavement. Over time, when cracks or joints in a rock become eroded, it creates a unique effect that makes it look as though the land mysteriously transformed itself into a tile floor. The Checkerboard is made of limestone that cracked, weathered, and as a result, sprouted its signature squares. It’s likely stress from caves that once collapsed on the island also contributed to its unique appearance. In addition to the odd rocks, Spittal Pond Nature Reserve offers plentiful trails that wind through lush greenery.

Admiralty House was gifted to the British Royal Navy by the Bermuda Government back in the 1800s. Today, what’s left of the historic home is now surrounded by a park, hiking trails, and a hidden beach called Clarence Cove. Originally built for admirals who were stationed at the nearby dockyards, Admiralty House has had many lives, once serving as a Navy Hospital and as a signal center for the British Royal Navy during World War II. It was here that British officers would intercept coded messages from ships en route between the US and UK. When Admiralty House was built back in the 1800s, a nearby manmade cave—now known as Admiral’s Cave—once housed British convicts. In fact, there are several underground tunnels connecting underground caves, that were constructed in the 1800s by the British military. In 1951, Admiralty House was given back to the Bermuda government, abandoned and then eventually demolished. What is left are the remains of the once grand ballroom of this former naval outpost. By far, the biggest draw of Admiralty House today is its surrounding hiking trails, manmade caves, and cliff-jumping. A rocky path to Admiral’s Cave reveals a stairway leading to the open ocean. Visitors will opt to either jump into the inviting cerulean water from the stairs or jump off of the overhanging cliffs.  Admiralty House Park is open from sunrise to sunset daily and is free to enter. The park is visitor friendly, offering on-site portable toilets, picnic areas, hiking trails, a basketball court, and more.

127,Royal Navy Docks,Bermuda,"Once a strategically imperative naval base, portions of this Bermuda dock complex now serve cruise ships.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-abandoned-royal-navy-docks-bermuda,"At the far northwestern end of the island of Bermuda lie the former dockyards of the Royal Navy. Once the most feared fighting fleet ever to sail the ocean, the gradual collapse of the British Empire during the 20th century saw the port’s usefulness fade away, until the 1950s, when the last ship sailed for England. The dockyard was abandoned in 1958. Following the loss of the American colonies after their defeat in the War of Independence, the island of Bermuda took on an increased importance for Great Britain. Faced with threats to their naval supremacy from both the burgeoning American fleet and marauding French privateers sent by Napoleon to cripple British trade in the New World, Bermuda was selected to become the new headquarters for the North America and West Indies Station of the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy immediately started pouring money into Ireland Island, the northwestern-most island in the Bermuda chain. Developing over 200 acres, it began building a giant dockyard and port, protected by a system of fortifications. Bermuda was where the immense Royal Navy could refit its ships, and be used as a base to protect its dominance in the Western Atlantic. The dockyard was built by slaves from the British colonies of the Caribbean, and by thousands of convicts shipped over from England, but principally Ireland: the forced labourers lived in appalling conditions on the sub-tropical colonial outpost. The importance of the new base was shown during the War of 1812, with the blockade of American ports being orchestrated out of Bermuda. When the Royal Navy, carrying an expeditionary force of 5,000 troops and Royal Marines, attacked Washington DC, setting fire to the White House, they sailed from the new Navy Dockyard on Ireland Island. It was from one of the Bermuda ships that prisoner Francis Scott Key wrote the Star Spangled Banner. The Royal Navy dockyard retained its strategic importance through the two World Wars; the protection of the trans-Atlantic convoys from the U-Boat wolf packs was organized from Bermuda. But devastated by both World Wars, and with its Empire drastically reduced, Britain found its influence in the Western Atlantic usurped by the United States. The once bustling and vital dockyard found itself surplus to requirements, and it was eventually left by the Royal Navy. Its status was reduced from Dockyard to Naval Base in 1951, and the dockyard facilities were mostly removed in 1958 (althouth still serving as a British Navy outpost until 1995). The physical plant was left abandoned to the turbulent weather conditions of the Atlantic after naval units were withdrawn. After 20 years of decay, a group of volunteers took over the keep, restoring the old fortifications as a home for a new Bermuda Maritime Museum. As tourism to the small colonial island grew, $50 million renovations transformed parts of the old dockyard into a complex of restaurants, shops, and a new dock for cruise ships to accompany the excellent museum. But large parts of the old dockyard, including the old victualing yard, remain untouched, as they were when the Royal Navy left. The victualing yard was comprised of a square, guarded by cannon and surrounded by warehouses, the former home of the Royal Navy stores. Run by the Board of Commissioners for the Victualing of the Navy, under the auspices of the Admiralty, it would have been stocked with enough provisions to send the fleet out for months at a time. Barrels of ship’s biscuit, salt beef, pease, lime juice, grog, beer, as well as livestock and grains were kept here. Other warehouses were home to Navy ordnance. If a ship of the line limped into port, its sails, masts and rigging ravaged by storms or enemy grapeshot, the yard was the first port of call for the ship’s Master. The northern end of the yard was home to the cooperage, where the thousands of barrels used to house the Navy stores were manufactured and maintained. Whilst some areas of the old dock have benefitted from restoration and have been reclaimed for tourism, large stretches have been left alone. The organization behind the development of the Dockyard, the West End Development Corporation, (WedCo, created by an act of the legislature in 1982) are looking for ways to restore the yard that will retain its historical importance. Andrew Dias, the WedCo General Manager, says “the worst thing that can happen to these structures is that they remain empty. At the same time we have to strike a balance with their history, and that’s not always easy.” Invitations for ideas to restore the rest of the Dockyard were requested in 2015, and proffered suggestions are being evaluated and worked as funds become available. In the meantime, many of the ship yards and lofts of what was once the world’s greatest Navy lie empty.  Most cruise ships that visit Bermuda dock in the royal navel dockyard.There is also ferry and bus services available to and from the city of Hamilton",military history abandoned military
128,The Abandoned Royal Navy Commander's House,Bermuda,The abandoned Bermudian home of a British naval leader is surrounded by crumbling sporting fields and the graves of convicts.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-abandoned-royal-navy-commander-s-house-bermuda,"When the Royal Navy left its station in Bermuda in 1953, handing over 300 years of dominance in the Western Atlantic to the United States, it kept a small presence on the island. The historic, sprawling dockyards to the west on Ireland Island were left to ruin, but the venerable old navy maintained a token force behind, named HMS Malabar. For 40 years the small garrison force was run out of a now abandoned complex on the southern tip of Ireland Island North. The centerpiece of the outpost was a once grand home belonging to the Royal Navy Commanding Officer, Bermuda. Standing proudly on a bluff overlooking the ocean, the elegant white house featured a two-story wrap-around porch, club rooms, and extensive playing fields. The home is situated on the corner of Cockburn’s Cut, itself named after Vice-Admiral Sir George Cockburn, commander of the British forces in Bermuda, who not only had the distinction of burning the White House in 1814 but of conveying Bonaparte to his final exile on St. Helena. The grounds surrounding the once elegant home were made of limestone, most of which was quarried by slave and convict labor, to construct the larger dockyard to the north. The grounds of the Commander’s home were turned into playing fields for the sailors’ games of tennis, cricket, and football. A short distance further south is a small cemetery which was used to bury the convicts who died while building the dockyard. Rather than be executed in Britain, over 9,000 convicts were shipped to Bermuda, of whom 2,000 died amidst the horrific conditions endured. Despite the thousands of deaths, only 13 graves are marked here, of which only four are named. When the small garrison finally sailed to England for good in 1995, the former home of its commander was allowed to fall apart. The old playing fields, like the house overshadowing it, were also left to fall into disrepair. For a short time, they were home to the Ireland Island Rangers football team, who plied their trade in the second tier of Bermudan association football. But today the playing fields are also closed and forlorn. Of all the types of abandoned places, there is always something quite poignant about a decaying sporting venue. Where once the concrete flagstaffs would have clattered with the sound of studs on boots, signaling the beginning of a new football season, today the fields lie silent and overgrown. The goal nets have withered away, and the changing rooms shuttered closed against the volatile sub-tropical winds. Bermuda, once one of Britain’s most strategically important outposts, is filled with similar such abandoned buildings; the last remnants of the old Empire, which are slowly fading away on a small island, isolated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Update: Since Bermuda hosted the America’s Cup in 2017 this property has now been completely renovated.",naval history sports cemeteries abandoned
129,The Royal Naval Cemetery,Bermuda,"The final resting place for Bermuda's British military, including a man who died of sunstroke.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-royal-naval-cemetery-bermuda,"Known as bucolically as “The Glade,” Bermuda’s small Royal Naval Cemetery holds the remains of British naval officers posted to Bermuda who died during the 19th and 20th centuries including victims of drowning, and sunstroke, but mostly yellow fever. Many of the soldiers who perished in mid-Atlantic battles during the World Wars, instead of being returned to their home countries, were simply buried on the nearby islands. The Royal Naval Cemetery in Bermuda was actually established before the docks it was meant to serve were even complete, almost as though it was a statement on the acceptance of death during wartime. In any event, before the large population of military men were buried in the cemetery, which in the beginning were open to all (except for convicts), an outbreak of yellow fever quickly began to fill up the plots. During World War II, a number of the soldiers who died in nearby engagements were buried in the naval cemetery as it transitioned to a private military burial ground. American forces would later lease some of the land on the island from the British government, but this cemetery stands as a reminder of who owned the land first.

130,The Baths,"Spanish Town, British Virgin Islands",This huge pile of volcanic boulders hides a stunning network of secret grottoes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-baths-spanish-town-british-virgin-islands,"Strewn about a sun-drenched beach on Virgin Gorda Island are a number of massive boulders known collectively as “The Baths,” and hidden around and beneath these titanic rocks are a number of pools and grottoes waiting to be discovered by leisurely vacationers. The Virgin Islands are known for their scenic vacation spots but few are as unique and wondrous as The Baths. Huge rounded stones composed mainly of granite are piled up on top of each other at the Southern tip of Virgin Gorda, left there by volcanic shifting that deposited the great rocks and shaped them into their present shape. Thanks to the largely spherical shape of the boulders, they settled over one another imperfectly creating a short system of voids within the piles, many of which have partially filled with sea water, creating magical natural grottoes. The rest of Virgin Gorda is no slouch when it comes to beauty, either, with a number of golden beaches and even some abandoned industrial ruins. Unfortunately, such beautiful natural wonders could not stay hidden for long, and now the rocky maze of tidal ponds is a well known vacation destination. Yet no amount of gawking tourists and sunbathing beauties can ruin what is one of the most amazing natural phenomena anywhere on earth.",geological oddities natural wonders geology nature
131,Anegada Conch Middens,"Anegada, British Virgin Islands",A mountain of conch shells created by centuries of fishermen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anegada-conch-middens,"On the East End of Anegada, the most remote and sprawling landmass in the British Virgin Islands, a 12-foot-high mountain range of conch shells—carbon-dated to the 13th century—serves as the sole visual reminder that indigenous people once hunted the turquoise waters of the Caribbean’s yachting capital. First appearing on charts in the 1600s, the mounds were at one time thought to be the “Indian burial grounds” that Anegadeans still speak of. The shells have been occasionally removed and burned for lime, with no trace of human remains found. It appears more likely that the shells, each with a hole cut in the tip to more easily remove the marine snail dwelling within, were tossed there to get them out of the way, the current not being strong enough to carry them off. The local theory, which science may support, posits that the fishermen began the pile—instead of scattering shells on the sea floor—to keep the live conch around, since they’ll naturally avoid places full of their dead brethren. In any case, even as the conch elsewhere in the Caribbean dwindles due to overfishing, the population in Anegada remains stable and continues to be the BVI’s bread (or fish) basket. Tour guides have begun motoring curious visitors to gawk at the mounds, accessible only by boat and keen local piloting skills. Fishermen continue to visit them to discard their daily catch, ensuring that even as the lower shells dissolve into the seabed the mounds themselves will remain.",mounds shells sea islands
132,Kodiak Queen,British Virgin Islands,Divers can encounter an abandoned warship encircled by a giant kraken submerged in the British Virgin Islands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kodiak-queen,"The Kodiak Queen is a decorated World War II Navy fuel barge previously named the YO-44. It is believed to be one of only five ships that survived the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. After being converted into a commercial fishing trawler and used for a few decades, it finally ended up abandoned in the British Virgin Islands. There it was waiting to be, most likely, picked apart for scrap metal. Instead, things took a very different turn after British photographer Owen Buggy came across the ship. Buggy approached his former boss, Sir Richard Branson, with an idea: to create an artificial reef and art exhibit out of the abandoned barge. An 80-foot-long sculpture of a kraken was built around the Kodiak Queen, made to look as if the sea monster was attacking the ship and dragging it into the deeps of the ocean. The art reef was then towed out into the bay and sunk in April of 2017. The sculpture and the Kodiak Queen both survived the massive hurricanes of that year, but were damaged in one of the biggest series of swells that’s ever occurred in the area. The whole ship was shifted about 30 feet, and the head of the kraken sculpture was damaged. Most of the tentacles are still wrapped around the ship, however, and the strange site is still a spectacular dive.  The Kodiak Queen is located in a bay just outside of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands. It's possible to see by snorkeling, but divers will get a better experience of the sculpture.",coral reefs underwater ships world war ii water abandoned military art
