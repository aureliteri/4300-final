0,Blue Lagoon,"Grindavík, Iceland",Medicinal spa created with the discharge from a geothermal energy plant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-lagoon,"The lava fields by the Svartsengi geothermal plant were accidentally transformed into a spa in the 1970s. Discharged water from the plant, which is rich in salt, blue-green algae, sulphur, and white silica, was found to help with skin problems by locals who ventured into the run-off. All of Iceland’s electricity comes from hydroelectric or geothermal sources, like that at the Blue Lagoon. By utilizing the water left by the many glaciers and the heat coming from below the volcanic island, the country requires fossil fuels only for its transportation. The Icelandic power plants are not generating energy so much as harnessing the renewable sources that are constantly coming up from the ground. The Blue Lagoon is now one of Iceland’s most popular attractions, while the geothermal plant continues to work at its edge, pulling seawater up from 2,000 meters underground, bringing earth minerals with it. Once moved through the turbines in the plant, the seawater comes into the lagoon via a pipeline, free of bacteria and with a temperature of around 39°C (102°F). Hundreds of thousands of visitors come each year to swim in the sapphire waters, shrouded with an ethereal steam mist.",hot springs inventions water
1,Svartifoss,Iceland,The unique waterfall in Iceland's south features a backdrop of geometric black lava columns.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/svartifoss,"On paper, the Svartifoss Waterfall is nothing to write home about. It doesn’t enter the top 10 lists for size or volume, and it’s quietly tucked in a small national park in southern Iceland. But a picture is worth 1,000 words, and the black, hexagonal columns that frame the thin falls make it one of the most striking and unique waterfalls in the world. Formed from lava flows in Skaftafell National Park, the Svartifoss are situated along a beautifully marked track a few kilometers into the park. Over centuries, lava flows cooled at a languid pace in Iceland’s frosty air, gently forming the stacked hexagonal crystals that provide the backdrop for the falls. Turned to a striking black color over its creation, the cliffs contrast with the green flora and cascading falls and provide the site with its name. Although the falls are so beautiful you might be tempted to step in for a dip, it is far from recommended as the bottom of the falls are covered with sharp rocks. Instead, visitors should hike through the park to the falls, which were recently featured in the Bon Iver film clip, Holocene.  There is a marked track from Skaftafell National Park to lead you to Svartifoss",waterfalls geological oddities water geology
2,The Museum of Icelandic Sorcery & Witchcraft,"Hólmavík, Iceland","Staves, storm-calling, and of course, necropants.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-museum-of-icelandic-sorcery-witchcraft-holmavik-iceland,"While witches are traditionally thought of as female, those accused of witchcraft in Iceland were traditionally male, but during a superstitious time in the country’s past, they were executed just the same. At Strandagaldur, the museum of Icelandic sorcery & witchcraft, these times of magic and fear are remembered in often shocking detail. The museum focuses on the elaborate and esoteric spells and rituals that the regional magic called for which would provide such effects as conjuring a creature to steal goat’s milk or making someone invisible. The collection features a number of artfully displayed original artifacts and entertaining replicas such as rune-carved pieces of wood, animal skulls, and a number of Icelandic magical staves. However, the most shocking and remarkable piece is easily the so-called “necropants“ which is the dried skin of a man from the waist down. These horrifying leggings were used in a spell that would supposedly bring the caster more money. The museum also features a display of an undead skeleton breaking up through the floor to further explicate the terror sorcery once caused the local people. Strandagaldur stands as a graphic reminder that while witchcraft has been feared the world over, Iceland really turned sorcery into something terrifying.",ao loves halloween 2022 witchcraft magic museums
3,Hvítserkur,Iceland,Rising from the sea like a stone monster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hvitserkur,"Hvitserkur, which translates to “white shirt” and derives its name from being covered in Shag and Cormorant guano, rises 15 metres, or nearly 50 feet from the sea. It was once the plug of a volcano, but over the years the craters surrounding the rock plug gave way to the pounding Atlantic Ocean leaving only the unusual outcropping Hvítserkur behind. Curiously, Hvítserkur itself would have given way to the ocean as well, had its foundations not been shored up with concrete some years ago. Icelandic legend has it that the rock was a troll who forgot to retreat from the light and was turned to stone in the sunrise, though from some angles it is said to look like a dragon drinking from the water.

4,Gljúfrabúi,"Hamragarðar, Iceland",This fantastical waterfall is hidden in a cave located in a cracked cliff.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gljufrabui,"Waterfalls can make for some of the most magical vistas in the world as they carve solid rock into often incredible formations. Such is the case with Iceland’s Gljúfrabui waterfall, which is almost completely hidden behind a cliff face. The waterfall has carved a mossy cylindrical chamber into the rock which can only be reached through a thin crack in the outside cliff wall. Once through the crack, explorers are hit with the incredible majesty of the hidden waterfall as it crashes into a pool at the base of the cave. The interior of the cave is nearly completely covered in a thin carpet of greenery thanks to its continually moist surroundings. These clandestine waterworks distill the natural wonder of Iceland’s scenic beauty.  This waterfall is easily accessible from Route 249 is a short distance off the Route 1 Ring Road in Iceland.

5,Kerid Crater Lake,Iceland,This eye-popping Icelandic crater lake is surrounded by red volcanic rock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kerid-crater-lake,"In Iceland, you can’t just have a stunning lake. No, it also has to be inside of a volcanic caldera. And sometimes that’s not even enough, so the showiest country in the world provides something like Kerid Crater Lake, which is a nearly neon blue lake sitting in a volcano surrounded by rare red volcanic rock. Located in southern Iceland along the so-called Golden Circle, Kerid is unique among crater lakes in that its caldera likely didn’t form from an explosion as most do. The Kerid volcano is thought to have formed when the magma in the center simply depleted itself, and the empty chamber beneath caved in. Regardless of the geological minutia that led to the lake’s creation, its bright rainbow of colors look unearthly. In addition to the bright, sapphire-colored waters, the steep slopes of the caldera’s bowl are almost entirely covered in red volcanic rock. There is one, less-steep side of the slope that is covered in rich green moss, as though the lake weren’t colorful enough. During winter, however, Kerid transforms from a vibrant place to a hotspot of Icelandic desolation and starkness. In truth, it’s no less beautiful or impressive in winter, just different. The lake itself freezes over and becomes a giant ice rink for the most adventurous tourists. The rest of the crater, like the surrounding landscape, is caked in ice and snow. Though bleak, it’s perhaps easier to feel the vastness and raw power of the natural forces that govern Iceland. The lake can be visited along with tours of the Golden Circle, just try not to lose yourself in its beautiful blue eye.  In the southern part of the Golden Circle, the crater is located 15 km north of Selfoss, right off highway 35. It costs 400 kronur to enter and walk around the rim.

6,Hallgrimskirkja,"Reykjavik, Iceland","One of the tallest buildings in Iceland, and perhaps, the most visually impressive.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hallgrimskirkja,"Rising 244 feet above the streets of Reykjavik is Hallgrimskirkja. The building is situated in the capital city’s center and has become one of Reykjavik’s best-known symbols. The Lutheran church has a stylized concrete exterior inspired by the distinctive basalt formations found throughout Iceland, such as the waterfall Svartifoss. This gives the building an appearance more akin to a spaceship than a place of worship and makes it a unique feature of Reykjavik’s skyline. Although construction began in 1945, the church took 38 years to build, as many parts of the church were consecrated and in use at different times. Besides its stunning exterior, its most famous feature inside is a huge organ that was built in Germany in 1992, boasting 5,275 pipes. It is 15 meters tall and weighs 25 tons. Along with an exploration of the inside of the Hallgrimskirkja, the bell tower, which is accessible via an elevator, provides the best views in the city. A hidden gem is the large stained glass window above the church entrance. From the outside the window isn’t done justice, it’s only when you see it with natural backlight that you really see its beauty. The window is on the tower’s second floor, accessible through stairs on the right-hand side of the entrance. There is also a statue of Leif Ericksson in front of the church, a gift from the United States in 1930. The statue predates the actual construction of the church and was given to Iceland in commemoration of the 1000 year anniversary of Althingy, the Icelandic parliament at Thingvellir in 930A.D. Perhaps the best time of year to see Hallgrimskirkja is New Year’s Eve. Icelanders and tourists alike gather in the square in front of the church to count down towards midnight and welcome in the New Year. A huge fireworks display takes places all across Reykjavik, with a particular focus above Hallgrimskirkja. The results are spectacular and the church really comes alive, illuminated by the dazzling colours.  There is an admission fee for the tower, which is only accessible via a lift. It is ISK 1,000 (Icelandic króna) for adults and ISK 100 for children, which is payable at the church's gift shop.",music sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
7,Jökulsárlón,Iceland,Iceland's largest lagoon is home to stunning multi-colored icebergs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/joekulsarlon,"Despite the splendor of Jökulsárlón’s light blue and milky-white icebergs, the beauty of the glacial pool in southeastern Iceland is bittersweet. As the melting of nearby glaciers has accelerated, the landscape grows both increasingly stunning and fragile. Since the 1970s, the melting glaciers have grown the Jökulsárlón lagoon to be four times larger, now measuring at 11.1 square kilometers wide. Formed entirely from glacial melt, Jökulsárlón is situated directly next to Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajökull, which covers eight percent of the country. As chunks of ice break off Vatnajökull, they float atop the icy blue waters of this whimsical glacial lagoon. Scientists estimate that the continued rate of melting of Vatnajökull will cause a massive fjord to exist where the glacier once stood, again adding to the natural beauty of Iceland’s landscape, but doing so at a great environmental expense. A visit to Jökulsárlón has become a must for Iceland bound travelers keen on seeing the lagoon that has become popularized in such films as “A View to a Kill,” “Die Another Day,” “Tomb Raider,” and “Batman Begins.” For those keen on seeing the Aurora Borealis, Jökulsárlón is a fantastic place to watch the Northern Lights. Photographers will often come and set-up their tripods before sunset.  Jökulsárlón is located between Skaftafell National Park and Höfn, in southern Iceland and is only accessible by car or bus. Travelers can rent a car from Keflavik Airport, outside Reykjavík, or may book one of the many available tours to in Reykjavík to Jökulsárlón and other Golden Circle highlights. Upon arrival at Jökulsárlón, travelers will find available zodiac boat tours that take people on a tour of the glacial lagoon and up close to the Vatnajökull iceberg. If hungry, you'll also find a small cafe at Jökulsárlón with available snacks. For a more robust meal—and perhaps one of the only food options in the immediate area—drive 15 minutes east to Hotel Hali, which serves up Icelandic comfort food. Pro tip: For a stellar view nearby, leave the main parking lot, cross the bridge and park in one of the rocky pull-offs. Hike up and over the hills to get down to a private rocky beach that offers a fantastic vantage point for the Northern Lights.",natural wonders water nature
8,Fjaðrárgljúfur,Iceland,Strange rock formations tower above the river that snakes through this enchanting Icelandic canyon.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fjadrargljufur,"Fjaðrárgljúfur (Fjadrargljufur in English) is a canyon a bit off the path off Iceland’s famous Ring Road. At just over a mile long, it certainly doesn’t boast the enormous expanses of the world’s other mighty canyons. But what it may lack in size, it absolutely makes up for in beauty. The canyon is made up of an assortment of crazy rock formations. They stretch skyward, flanking a river like gargantuan grass-clad guardians. A walking trail traces the top of the crags, leading to a certain spot that lets hikers feel as though they’re standing atop a kingdom of sublime natural wonders. When the river bled from the glaciers and carved its way through the land about two million years ago, it whittled out strange geologic patterns. The walls jut in and out, swerving back and forth so the water takes the shape of a blue snake slithering across the terrain. The majestic canyon slices through a patch of lush green earth. The river weaves through the verdant chasm, reflecting the colors of the sky and clouds above in its rippling water. The whole place has an enchanting feel. It’s the kind of landscape where you half expect to see elves or fairies peeking out from the many nooks and crannies.

9,Bridge Between Continents,Iceland,Walk in the footsteps of the gods and straddle two tectonic plates.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/midlina-bridge-between-continents,"Iceland is slowly being pulled in two. At a rate of 2.5 centimeters per year, the mid-Atlantic ridge is pulling apart the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. While most of this happens deep on the ocean floor, in Iceland, the ridge—a major tectonic plate boundary that sits between the North American and Eurasian plates—runs right through the middle of the island. A large fissure can be seen running across the land and splitting rock formations down the middle. In the eerie, otherworldly landscape of the vast lava fields on the Reykjanes Peninsula, the “The Bridge Between Continents” bridge crosses one of these rifts created by the mid-Atlantic ridge. It’s also referred to as “Midlina.” The bridge was previously called “Leif the Lucky” bridge, named after the famous explorer Leif Ericson, who was known for being the first Icelander to set foot in North America over 1,000 years ago. It also serves as a symbol for the connection between two continents, Europe and North America, new world and old. On the midway point of the bridge, a plaque reads, “The Bridge Between Continents,” and it serves as a borderline between the Eurasian plate and North American plates. The two sides are marked: ″Welcome to America″ and ″Welcome to Europe.″ Despite the epic feeling you may have jumping across ancient continental boundaries as old as the Earth, the border is entirely symbolic.",geographic markers bridges geological oddities monuments geology
10,The Arctic Henge,"Raufarhöfn, Iceland",This modern monument to pagan belief looks like it was transported straight from ancient times.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-arctic-henge-raufarhofn-iceland,"Located in one of Iceland’s most remote northern villages, the Arctic Henge is a colossal piece of stone construction that evokes neolithic monuments throughout the world. Started in 1996, the Arctic Henge project is a monument not only to the country’s Nordic roots, but also to some of the neo-pagan beliefs that have arisen in certain areas. The piece was inspired directly from the Eddic poem Völuspá (Prophecy of the Seeress), taking from it the concept of 72 dwarves who represent the seasons in the world of the poem, among other symbolic queues. In the Arctic Henge, 72 small blocks, each inscribed with a specific dwarven name will eventually circle four larger stone monuments, which in turn will surround a central balanced column of massive basalt blocks. Each aspect of the deliberate layout corresponds to some aspect of ancient Norse belief and when each piece of the monument is installed, visitors will be able to “capture the midnight sun” by viewing it through the various formations at different vantage points depending on the season. As of September 2021, the monument is still a work in progress. When it is complete, the Arctic Henge could easily become the premier site for Paganism in the entire world, and millennia from now it might seem as mysterious as Stonehenge seems to us today.",megalithic witchcraft rocks monuments geology
11,Dettifoss,Iceland,The most powerful waterfall in all of Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dettifoss,"In Iceland’s Vatnajökull National Park, the waters of the mighty Dettifoss are ever-crashing. The waters of the falls comes from the nearby Vatnajökull glacier, whose sediment-rich runoff colors the water a greyish white. The superlative of “most powerful” comes from its water flow coupled with its height. The falls, fed by the wide River Jökulsá, fall a total of about 150 feet, causing a massive, crashing spray. This can make getting close to the falls difficult. The pathways surrounding are frequently slippery, and authorities warn visitors to maintain a safe distance due to frequent accidents on the paths. This doesn’t stop visitors though. Dettifoss is the Niagara of Iceland and draws thousands of sightseers. The best view is by reaching the waterfall from the east.

12,Thrihnukagigur Volcano,Iceland,Climb right into the heart of this colorful Iceland volcano.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thrihnukagigur-volcano,"Volcanos are usually things to be admired from a safe distance, but inside of most everyone is an excitable inner voice that really just wants to climb into that caldera and see what its like inside. Iceland’s Thrihnukagigur Volcano actually lets adventurous spelunkers live out that adolescent dream. Last erupting over 4,000 years ago the three calderas of Thrihnukagigur Volcano have lain dormant for so long that one of them is even safe to climb into. Unlike most dormant volcanos which simply cool with their previously roiling ocean of magma in place, creating one solid plug, the fathoms of magma that once boiled inside of one of Thrihnukagigur’s peaks seem to have simply sunk back down into the earth, leaving a massive, stunning cavern. Hiking out almost an hour into the Icelandic highlands, visitors can now approach the open summit and descend hundreds of feet into the main magma chamber via a cable lift. The main chamber is so large that according to the website, it could house the Statue of Liberty in its entirety. The craggy walls of the cavern are not the jet black obsidian that one might expect either, but instead they are covered in a gleaming pearlescent rainbow of colors that almost make the cave look as though it is made purely of gems. Each excursion into the volcano’s depths lasts around an hour or two, making the experience a bit truncated considering how incredible a feat it is to literally lower one’s self into a what was once one of the most impossible locations on Earth.",volcanoes geological oddities natural wonders geology nature

A popular local hiking trail leads into the valley after about an hour’s trek, which is eventually dominated by a gorgeous geothermal river. The river bank is reminiscent of a muddy expressionist painting due to the natural composition of the waters. Near boiling waters from a natural hot spring mix with cold river waters in the valley, creating hot baths that visitors can relax in. Many locals and visitors actually come here to bathe in the warm river but keep in mind there are no bathroom facilities so you’ll have to strip in the cool Icelandic air. Also, pay heed to the signs warning “Hætta!” (this means “Danger!” in Icelandic). Along the gravel path leading into the valley, not only will you see beautiful sights of waterfalls, but you’ll also find hot, bubbling (and yet beautiful) mud pools that reach temperatures of 100ºC. The steam rising from these pools pours over the hiking trail like a warm sulfur-smelling fog. Signs remind hikers to stay on the trail because flowing under the ground is hot, molten lava and you never know when a hot spring might erupt in your face. The town of Hveragerði is actually powered in part by the same geothermal energy that makes Reykjadalur such a haunting location.

15,Godafoss,Iceland,This elegant arc of a waterfall marks a religious turning point.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/godafoss,"The story of the Goðafoss (Waterfall of the Gods) is that of Iceland’s remarkably democratic conversion to Christianity in the year 1000. The question before the Althing parliamentary assembly in that year was whether Iceland should embrace Christianity, or continue in “the old custom.” The assembled lawmakers were bitterly divided. According to the Íslendingabók, a civil war was narrowly avoided through the leadership of a man named Þorgeir Ljósvetningagoði. After a day and a night of meditation, Ljósvetningagoði, who was himself a pagan priest, decided in favor of Christianity. The compromise brokered by the Althing left pagans able to practice in private, even though Christianity became Iceland’s official religion. Following his monumental decision, Ljósvetningagoði formally converted to Christianity. To demonstrate his new faith, he threw idols of the old Norse gods into this waterfall, giving it its name. A thousand years later, a church named after Ljósvetningagoði was built nearby, complete with a stained glass window depicting his dramatic effigy disposal. Today, Godafoss remains one of the largest and most beautiful waterfalls in Iceland, running through Bárðardalur and Kinn in the country’s northeastern corner. At 30 meters wide and curving gently along a semicircular rim, it falls 12 meters into a frothing pool - a sight for the gods in more ways than one.",iceland waterfalls water

If you venture just 25 minutes outside of Iceland’s capital, however, to a village called Hafnarfjordur, you’ll find a 3,000-foot-long lava tube that looks like you’re entering the depths of a hardened lava hell. Translating literally to “The End of the Road,” the Leiðarendi lava tube resembles the inside of an artery more than it does a typical geologic feature in Iceland, giving it the nickname of “volcanic veins.” At the length of over three football fields and easily walkable, the red lava tube of Leiðarendi serves as the perfect getaway for those intrigued by both natural history and adventure, requiring a modest amount of hunching and climbing to complete the caving journey. Along the voyage, the tour guides bring visitors to “the world’s darkest place,” a section of the cave that couldn’t possibly be any more pitch black. Complete with drip stalagmites, shark tooth stalactites, lava flakes, and “lava hands,” Leiðarendi was created relatively recently at an estimated two thousand years ago. The lava tube was formed when the Stóri-Bolli (“Big Cup”) crater was ruptured in a volcanic eruption, causing lava to flow outward, molding out Leiðarendi.",craters subterranean natural history underground volcanoes subterranean sites geological oddities geology
17,Álfaskólinn (Elf School),"Reykjavik, Iceland",Learn about Iceland's hidden folk at this school dedicated to the study of elves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alfaskolinn-elf-school,"Some Icelanders take their belief in elves very seriously. For example, road crews in Iceland will sometimes hire folklore experts to determine if certain boulders are homes to elves, and will divert the road around the boulder if it turns out there are little people living within it. This belief in elves doesn’t stop with road workers and superstitious locals either. After escaping a car crash unscathed, a member of the Icelandic Parliament had a 30-ton boulder moved to near his home because he believed that the local elves inside the boulder used their magic to save him. While there are many Icelanders who pay no mind to the superstitious elf-talk, there is a higher-than-average number of citizens that are believers. With all that said, it’s not surprising to see that there’s an entire school dedicated to learning about these hidden people. Located in the thoroughly modern city of Reykjavik, the school has a full curriculum of study about the 13 types of elves in Iceland. This concentration comes with a set of published textbooks with drawn depictions of these creatures for reference in the classroom, or just in case you encounter one in the wild. The school studies Iceland’s other supernatural fauna as well, such as fairies, trolls, dwarves, and gnomes, but they mainly focus on elves, because they are the most commonly believed in and “seen.” The school also offers five-hour classes for curious travelers which include a tour of hidden folk habitats and ends with coffee and pancakes with the school’s headmaster. He alone makes the experience worthwhile, as his genuine belief in elves and pointed sense of humor provide quality entertainment regardless of whether you believe his stories or not. Be prepared to be made fun of (especially if you’re Canadian) and to be surrounded by the likes of psychics and mediums. At the end, you will have a beautiful diploma to show off to your friends and colleagues as proof that you were sufficiently educated in the affairs of elves.",superstitions repositories of knowledge schools cultures and civilizations

It performs on time, it’s flashy, it’s ancient, and it won’t cost you anything. There are a couple of real show-stoppers who go by the names of Geysir and Strokkur—one is the old pro, the other, you might say is the understudy. Geysir and Strokkur are a couple of erupting hot springs, or geysers, in the Haukadalur geothermal field, north of Iceland’s Laugarvatn Lake. The bigger of the two is Geysir (we get the English word from him, a derivative of an Old Norse word for “gush”), but he’s been a little shy about his star power recently, only spouting off sporadically. Strokkur, on the other hand, can’t contain himself, erupting reliably every 10 or 15 minutes, every day and night. There are other, smaller, geysers scattered around the field, as well as mineral springs and mud pots (a boiling slurry of geothermal water and dissolved minerals, rock and anything that happens to fall in). Although they’ve probably been active for 10,000 years or more, the hot springs of Haukadalur were first noted by Europeans back in the late 13th century, when the field erupted in geothermal activity after an earthquake. Starting in the 18th century the tourists came, looking for mineral baths, therapeutic mud, and just to watch the geysers blow. Geysir has been quiet recently, but its eruption in 2,000 of over 400 feet (122 m) holds the record for the highest known geyser blast of all time. His understudy, Strokkur, has more recently taken over the show. A little smaller, a little less experienced, but a whole lot more dependable. Visit during the winter months to catch the pale winter sun illuminating the steam shot into the air by the geysers. The short hours of weak sunlight mean you’ll get a glimpse of the stunning shades of orange and pink that you might not see during the summer.  Geysir, Strokkur and the geothermal field is about 95 miles (60 km) east of Reykjavík, accessible via Þingvallavegur. The area is public property, so it's open for viewing 24/7. There's a hotel, Geyser Center and campground all nearby, with a few restaurants offering hearty Icelandic food.

The Westman Islands, which host the world’s largest puffin colony, are a haven for the country’s iconic birds. There are over 1.1 million puffin burrows buried beneath the soil on the chain of islands. From late April to late summer the birds pepper the cliffs and meadows. During this time, around 20 percent of the world’s entire puffin population breeds and raises its young here. It’s an annual tradition for children of Heimaey, the archipelago’s only inhabited island, to form “pysja patrols” to rescue lost and disoriented young puffins (which they call pysjas) that have wandered from their nests. The kids scoop up the confused birds and bring them home for the night. They then release them back into the wild. The pysja patrols save thousands of adolescent puffins every year. Beyond the pysja patrols, puffins further are ingrained within life on Heimaey. Puffin images feature on murals and advertisements. Even the street signs are modeled after the orange-beaked birds. Until the population began to rapidly decline in the 2000s, locals hunted them as a traditional food source. The population has since started to rebound, to the joy of the islanders who consider the birds an important part of their culture.

Using videos, displays, advanced multimedia, and an atmosphere of eerie mystery, Arnarfjörður’s Skrímslasetrið museum delves into the history of Iceland’s sea monsters using the oral histories of those that have encountered them. Visitors can listen to eyewitness accounts, or view displays and literature exploring the history of such monsters. There is even an interactive table where amateur monster hunters can explore a map of Iceland’s coast, following pop-up stories of the monsters seen at various points. While reports of sea monsters greatly vary, there are four basic types that the museum says are endemic to the waters surrounding Iceland. Known as the the fjörulalli (Shore Laddie), the hafmaður (Sea Man), the skeljaskrímsli (Shell Monster) and the faxaskrímsli (Combed Monster/Sea Horse), each of the monsters have regularly reported characteristics that have made them identifiable at various sites around Iceland. Uniquely, Arnarfjördur claims to have seen sightings of all four over the years, making it a seeming hub of cryptozoological activity. Despite having no concrete evidence of any unexplainable creatures lurking in the waters, the museum treats the collected accounts of sailors and other seamen as largely factual. The cultural importance of sea monster stories is so closely intertwined with the beliefs of local seamen that Skrímslasetrið could almost rightly be called a natural history museum.",underwater week cryptozoology museums and collections museums
21,Aldeyjarfoss,Iceland,A little-visited waterfall in an otherworldly landscape.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aldeyjarfoss,"The landscape surrounding the Aldeyjarfoss is stark, weathered, and beautiful. You can see for miles over barren lava fields in all their glory. Walking up to the falls is a wonderful surprise; as you head up the path, the river comes into view, and you see that the sides of the gorge are lined with black basalt columns. In one section, the columns curve up in testament to the movement of the earth. There is also a large cave on the Skjalfandafljot river, very near the falls. The falls themselves are spectacular, among the most beautiful in Iceland. Yet few people make this trip, making it likely you will be the only one there. Though it’s not a huge cascade, the water pouring into its pool is quite glorious. To the right of the main falls are three smaller falls—you have to walk pretty far out on the edge to see them. The hike to the top of the falls is easy and from there you can walk out onto the rocks to see the power of the water as it heads over the crest and plunges in a 65-foot drop. The remoteness of the location, as well as the barren landscape, makes this place an otherworldly experience. It’s easy to imagine that you have been dropped on an alien planet. Or that you are an intrepid explorer discovering the falls for the first time ever! You must have good hiking boots for this site. The path to the falls is rocky and gravely and skirts the side of the hill with a pretty steep, and potentially dangerous, drop in many places. But the drive in and the walk to the falls are absolutely worth any effort you put in. From Akureyri head east on the Ring Road 40km to Godafoss waterfall (stop here to look at Godafoss too), and then turn right onto 842 going south. Aldeyjarfoss is not terribly difficult to get to, but does involve about a half hour on an unpaved road, and then about another 10 minutes on F26 that requires a 4 wheel drive vehicle. You can stop at the beginning of  F26 road, if you don't have a 4x4 and hike in.  F26 is beautiful and exciting. Regardless of whether you drive or hike the last segment, there is a gate across the road. If the gate is closed, then continuing may involve going onto private property.",martian landscapes hiking waterfalls natural wonders ecosystems water nature
22,Gullfoss (Golden Falls),Iceland,"If a glacial river suddenly diving into a sheer chasm via a dramatic, multi-stage waterfall isn't peak Iceland, it's certainly close.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gullfoss-golden-falls,"The Hvítá river is formed by the meltwater from the Lángjökull glacier pouring out of Hvítávatn lake to begin its journey to the sea. About 40 kilometers (25 miles) downstream the wide, rushing river suddenly turns and tumbles into a deep, narrow crevice set at an oblique angle to the original course, forming a truly spectacular waterfall in the process. Gullfoss translates as “Golden Falls,” and was so named because the high sediment content of glacial water makes it glow gold in the sunlight as it roars over the cataract. Gullfoss consists of three separate drops: a relatively gentle three-step staircase that begins the descent; and a two-stage waterfall with plunges of 11 meters (36 feet) and 21 meters (69 feet). The river then continues to flow south through a deep and narrow canyon with walls up to 70 meters (230 feet) high. In the 20th century, Gullfoss was considered for hydroelectric development; although the property was leased by different interested parties, an actual project failed to materialize. There is a frequently-told story that attributes the unspoiled state of the site to Sigríður Tómasdóttir, the daughter of the leasor who worked tirelessly to block development and even threatened to jump to her death in the falls if a dam was built. This story does not seem to be true, but its popularity is such that a plaque overlooking the cascade honors her memory. Today, Gullfoss is under the protection of the state, which maintains the falls in their natural state. This has proven to be a fairly successful arrangement, as Gullfoss is arguably Iceland’s most popular waterfall, and undoubtedly one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country.  There is no charge for visiting Gullfoss and, as it is considered a public space, it is open 24/7 all year round. It is roughly 120km from Reykjavik to Gullfoss and the journey can be done in any vehicle. Checking road conditions before departing is advised however. There is a café on site. The simplest way for tourists to visit Gullfoss is as part of one of the many Golden Circle tours offered by operators in Iceland. The waterfall is one of the most popular stops on such tours and is a stunning sight, regardless of the season.",waterfalls rivers natural wonders water nature
23,Seljavallalaug,"Skogar, Iceland",The oldest (maybe) swimming pool in Iceland is a stunning oasis built into the side of a lush hill.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seljavallalaug,"Going for a swim is probably not the first thing visitors to Iceland think to do, but seeing the lovely, historic Seljavallalaug pool might change their minds. Built in 1923, Seljavallalaug may be the oldest swimming pool in the entire country. It was created as a place where locals could learn to swim. Though many of them subsisted off the fishing industry, there was no formal place for them to develop their swimming skills. In modern Iceland, swimming training is mandatory in public schools, a trend that began with facilities such as Seljavallalaug. The 82-foot-long pool is built right into the rocks, in a shallow valley created by a pair of verdant, craggy hills. Until 1936, the remote swimming hole was the largest pool in Iceland. It is fed by a nearby hot spring that usually keeps the water at a temperature above freezing, although in the winter, ice still forms on the surface. On the far end of the pool is a small changing room that provides some privacy. It is basic–don’t expect showers–but does the job for those of a more modest nature. Getting to the pool is an adventure in  itself. Visitors can drive fairly close to the secluded valley that holds the Seljavallalaug, but they must eventually park and set out on foot. The trek to the pool takes around 20 minutes of hiking through fields of lava ash, dodging little streams running out of the valley. Seljavallalaug is not maintained in any official capacity but is cleaned once a year by a team of local volunteers. The waters are often covered in algae, and after the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, ash. Yet no matter what is floating in the historic waters of the pool, its natural beauty makes even ash and algae easy to ignore. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Seljavallalaug.  Price: Free of charge. Opening Hours: Open 24/7. What to bring?Besides your swimsuit, towel, bring a pair of flip-flops. It can get rather cold so bring a wooly hat. It's common to see people dipping in the water with a warm hat on their head. There aren't any shops, so bring some picnic goods to enjoy this perfect spot.  If you make the journey during the winter when the days are short, it's highly recommended to take with you a head-mounted flashlight in case you have to make your way back when it's already dark.",swimming pools pools hidden
24,Dimmuborgir,Iceland,These ominous lava formations were said to be an entrance to the netherworld so of course they inspired a famous metal band.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dimmuborgir,"Iceland has countless picturesque volcanic features, but possibly none is more ominously named as the Dimmuborgir site near Mývatn Lake in the country’s northland. The volcanic field is covered in jagged black lava stacks and caves that were formed in a massive eruption some 2,300 years ago. At the time of the eruption, there was likely a small body of water at the site that filled with lava, creating unique features once the excess magma flowed away, leaving the bleak geology behind. One of the most impressive features is a naturally formed rock arch known as “The Church.” The name Dimmuborgir translates to “Dark Castles,” or “Dark Cities,” and the ominous name is a fitting monicker not only thanks to the eerie rock formations but also thanks to the creepy folklore associated with the site. Dimmuborgir has often been associated with hell, often as a gate to the nether realms. As Christianity came to the country the site was said to be where Satan landed when after being tossed out of Heaven. More traditional folklore says that the lava field is the home of the endlessly creepy Icelandic trolls known as The Yule Lads. These proto-Santa figures are mischievous trolls with names like Spoon-Licker and Window-Peeper. All of this stark geology and creepy mythology doesn’t just sound like a heavy metal dream, the site inspired the name of black metal legends, Dimmu Borgir. Rocks have never looked so metal, or so beautiful.",rock formations volcanoes rocks music geology
25,Grafarkirkja,Iceland,The oldest church in Iceland is one of the few to feature ornate decoration.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grafarkirkja,"Originally constructed in the late 17th century, the turf church known as Grafarkirkja is not only the oldest Christian church in Iceland, but it is also one of the very few to feature any sort of ornamentation. While it is believed that there was a church of some sort on the spot that Grafarkirkja now rests, the 17th-century construction that remains today is thought to have been the work of a wood carver named Guðmundur Guðmundsson. Guðmundsson was so renowned in his day that his name survived down the centuries along with the unique woodwork he left on the church despite his position as a craftsman. Baroque design patterns adorn some of the support rafters and the altar is well-known for its idiosyncratic carvings as well. Most other turf structures from the time were relatively ascetic in their design, making Grafarkirkja stick out among its fellow historical sites as being of particular beauty. The church was actually deconsecrated not long after its construction and for years it was used as a tool shed. Despite this, the ancient turf oratory survived remarkably well across the centuries but eventually the National Museum of Iceland had the structure entirely rebuilt to its original condition in 1950. Now visitors can still visit the old holy house and remark on the long earthen history the chapel shack represents. Note there's a number of places called ""Grof"" in Iceland (it means grave)!

26,Whales of Iceland,"Reykjavik, Iceland",The largest whale museum in Europe allows visitors to walk among life-size giants.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/whales-of-iceland,"Iceland has a rich history with the giants of the sea, and while visitors to the country can sign up for a variety of whale watching tours, the only way to really take in the full scope and beauty of the country’s whales is in the massive Whales of Iceland museum, which may be the largest of its kind in the world. Opened in February of 2014, the huge exhibition is designed to recreate a stroll through a peaceful underwater wonderland right alongside life-size replicas of some of the largest animals on the planet (that we know of). In fact there are 23 foam and steel giants hanging from the walls and ceilings of the museum, each depicted in an accurate-as-possible 1:1 scale. The collection includes a variety of species including oversized dolphins such as the Beluga whale and the Orca, as well as massive baleen varieties such as Bowhead, Humpback, and Blue whales. Each specimen is bathed in a haunting blue light and aquatic sounds that sells the sensationalized illusion of seeing the beasts in their natural habitat. Each of the peaceful animals is accompanied by an information stand that gives visitors information about what makes each species unique. The Whales of Iceland exhibition was explicitly created to cater to the growing tourist population in Reykjavik but it is also devoted to educating visitors about the country’s conservation efforts, hoping to escape their image as a whaling nation. If getting up close to the fake titans is still not enough whale, the museum also partners with local whale-watching tours that can take you out to see a little bit of the real thing.

27,Silfra,"Thingvellir, Iceland",This natural Icelandic fissure allows divers to swim right between two volatile tectonic plates.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/silfra,"Officially known as the Silfra Tectonic Fissure, or just Silfra for short, this freshwater rift between two continents is not only geologically intriguing, it also happens to be stunningly beautiful. The rift sits in the gap between the North American and Eurasian continental plates, where an imperfect seam allows explorers into the watery depths an opportunity to dive towards the center of the Earth. The clear waters of Þingvallavatn Lake in the Þingvellir National Park attract divers from around the globe to experience the unique feeling of diving between worlds, where visibility is often as good as 300 feet between lava-rock cliffs. Even the waters in Silfra are unique. Since no rivers flow into Þingvallavatn Lake the water actually gets slowly extruded through the porous tectonic rock beneath the water’s surface. This process filters the water and not only accounts for the lake’s incredible clarity but also makes the lake mostly safe to drink. Pushing water through stone is not very quick no matter how porous the rock, so it takes between 50-100 years for the liquid to become part of the lake. Each drop of water in Silfra is likely over a century old. Photos of Silfra abound and even amateur divers and photographers find that their experience between the plates is like nothing else on Earth or in its waters.  Even if not a qualified diver you can see almost as much by snorkeling because the water is so clear. However be aware that only people with licensed dive organizations are allowed to dive or snorkel here. Also be aware that it is very expensive and if air temperatures fall below zero your 2-dive package will become a single dive. Because of gear freeze problems (and no compensation), it’s best to go in summer if diving is your main reason for the trip. The parking lot across the street is only for dive company vans. Other parking is available down the road near the bridge.",diving volcanoes natural wonders water geology nature
28,U.S. Navy DC-3 Wreckage,Iceland,This wrecked airplane has been sitting on a black sand beach since the 1970s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/us-navy-dc-3-wreckage,"Just inland on the shore of Iceland’s black sand Sólheimasandur Beach, the hull of a crashed military plane has been slowly falling apart since the 1970s, with a little help from enterprising locals. The US Navy DC-3 super bus plane crash landed in 1973, and luckily everyone survived. While no one is positive exactly why the airplane went down, the suspected culprit was an empty fuel tank that the pilot may have tried to access. However, whatever the reason, the plane had to make an emergency landing on the beach on November 24th, 1973. As opposed to attempting to salvage the wreckage, it was simply left to rot in its isolated spot on an Icelandic beach. While it is still in remarkably good condition given its 40 years out in the elements, a great deal of the fuselage has disappeared. According to one report, the entire tail section was stolen by a local farmer who sold it. However, most of the cabin and the wing engines are still found on the site. The walk out to the wreck is otherworldly - the landscape is harsh and the wind from the ocean can be intense. The plane has been stripped, but it’s still a dramatic site and fun to poke around. While it is pretty far off the beaten path, the picturesque wreckage still manages to attract a steady stream of visitors, but they do little to take away from the decaying majesty of the remains.",aircraft airplanes abandoned ruins

Down below Bankastræti, not far from the harbor docks, this tiny museum is dedicated to the Nordic nation’s punk scene, from its beginnings in the late 1970s all the way to the break-up of the Sugar Cubes in the early ’90s. The exhibits are in the former toilets and washbasins, with a jammed-in collections of photos, posters, hand-bills, instruments, stage equipment, and streaming videos of classic club shows. The collection covers performances from visiting bands as well as homegrown talent like Sigur Ros. You can listen to Icelandic punk records through the museum’s pull-down headphones, or get really campy and try on some jackets and strike a pose with the guitars and drum set. When the museum first opened its doors (stalls?), on hand to kick it off was Sex Pistols frontman Johnny Rotten himself. On display are the photos to prove it.  The museum is in a former underground restroom in downtown Reykjavík. It is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and weekends from noon to 10 p.m. Admission as of October 2019 is 1200 Icelandic krona (about $12).",punk music museums and collections museums
30,Drangsnes Hot Tubs,"Steingrímsfjörður, Iceland",A trio of hidden hot tubs takes advantage of Iceland's natural geothermal vents.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drangsnes-hot-tubs,"There are a number of pools across Iceland which take advantage of the natural heat issuing from the country’s geothermal vents, but the Drangsnes Hot Tubs are a partially hidden gem that offers a variety of temperatures right on the sea. Located in the small fishing town of Drangsnes, the public tubs rest right on the shoreline if you can find them. They are actually a few feet below the level of the road that runs right next to them, and there is no direct signage. The only marker is the small white changing house located across the road from the tubs. However, with a population of fewer than 100 people, the town’s traffic does not really detract from the experience. A forward-thinking local man has created an “honor bar” where one can grab a beer and leave a suggested donation behind. The three baths are all fed by the naturally heated spring beneath them. One of the pools is kept at a cool temperature, while one of the others is kept quite hot, and the third is simply a nice medium so visitors can get comfortable in whichever climate suits them. With the privacy afforded by the hot tubs and their prime location on the sea, the Drangsnes pools have also become a popular spot to watch the Northern Lights during the freezing winter.",swimming pools hot springs water
31,Snorralaug,"Reykholt, Iceland",This hobbit-y little hot spring may be the oldest spring used by humans in all of Iceland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snorralaug,"Located in the tiny Icelandic village of Reykholt, the beautiful little hot spring known as Snorralaug is thought to have been used by locals since the 12th century, making it possibly the oldest human-used hot spring in the country. The quaint little hot spring is first mentioned in the medieval writings of Snorri Sturluson, a poet, and politician whose work has made him a famous artisan even today. According to his writings, Sturluson used the naturally heated pool to bathe. Sturluson lived nearby and even had his own private tunnel that led from his home directly to the foot of the hot spring. While it is likely not how it looked in Sturluson’s time, today the pool is surrounded by a circle of flat flagstones, and a quaint stone patio that runs right up to the green burms around the hot spring. There is also a door set into the squat hill behind the pool that leads to Sturluson’s private tunnel, which can be investigated by curious visitors. Of course this door does nothing to discourage the spring’s fantastical look. The temperature of the hot spring is said to fluctuate drastically, often becoming far too hot to bath in. Should this be the case, Reykholt also has a library that is focused on Sturluson’s work, so while it’s not a dip in a hot spring from Middle Earth, if you can read Icelandic it may be just as relaxing of an experience.",swimming pools hot springs water
32,Hofskirkja,Iceland,This fairytale-like structure is the last turf church ever constructed in Iceland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hofskirkja-turf-church,"The thick blanket of grass atop this church spills toward the ground, making it look as though the roof is melting into the landscape. Burial mounds concealed beneath the surrounding greenery seem to bubble toward the surface, creating the illusion of earth rising to swallow the building whole. This fairytale-like building is the last turf church ever built in Iceland. Hofskirkja was originally constructed in 1884, though it was thoroughly restored in the 1950s. Unlike some of the country’s other turf churches, this one is still a practicing parish. The church is made from a timber skeleton surrounded by sturdy stone walls. It’s capped by heavy stone slabs draped in a cloak of greenery, which helps keep heat from escaping into the often raw, chilly air. When viewed from the back, it looks as though the building has begun to sink into the lumpy terrain. This is because the church is partially buried in the ground, allowing the earth to act as natural insulation. Turf buildings like this one once peppered Iceland’s villages. Using layers of dirt and grass to protect structures from bitter cold winters was a common practice throughout the region. It was particularly useful in Iceland, as the country’s early Nordic and Celtic settlers felled many of the island’s trees, leaving future generations with little available timber. But the turf trend began to wane in the 20th century, when concrete took over as the building material of choice. Now, there are only six turf churches left in Iceland, all of which are protected as historical monuments.  The church itself isn't open to tourists. However, the graveyard is, so you can still drop by to admire the building from the outside.",woodwork churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
33,Viking Village Film Set,"Höfn, Iceland",This replica Viking village was created for a film that was never shot and is now open to visitors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viking-village-film-set,"Have you ever wanted to unleash your inner Viking? Well, one location in Iceland is allowing visitors just that opportunity. By driving down a small gravel road twisting away from the main route between Höfn and Djúpivogur, curious visitors will arrive at what appears to be a remote Viking village in pristine condition. In reality, it is a film set for an Icelandic movie that was never filmed, but you’d definitely be forgiven for mistaking it for the real thing. Built in 2010, the set is located on the land of a local farmer. For a small fee, he allows visitors to wander around the amazing location, which is finally scheduled to make its debut next year in a film by Universal. Upon passing out of sight of the local Viking Café set up to entertain guests, visitors will be able to spy the fake settlement in the distance. The farmer’s horses graze nearby on the fields beneath the shadow of the mountain, adding extra authenticity to the surroundings. After entering the village walls, you are permitted to roam around the site at will. This offers the unique opportunity to observe the immaculate detail that goes into the creation of a film set. The most striking feature of the village is the buildings, which ape the architecture of the period magnificently. Guests can pry open the wooden doors and find themselves within a range of rooms that look almost indistinguishable from the real thing. But this is not the only piece of period detail; the settlement also comes equipped with a dungeon located beneath an enormous artificial boulder. The movie the village was created for was never actually filmed due to funding issues. Ever since, the location has waited in limbo for a production company to come along and use it. Recently, the wait finally ended when Universal acquired the rights to produce Vikingr, a film by the Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur. This film is expected to start production next year, with some of the filming taking place at the settlement. Meanwhile, the location remains open to the public. This means that those curious enough to stray from Iceland’s capital of Reykjavik can still role-play any pillaging fantasies.  From Höfn, head east for about three miles on Road 1. Once you turn off the road, you will head down a gravel road for approximately half a mile. You will then come across a cafe where you will pay 800 ISK to enter.

Nestled in the Icelandic Highlands, at the uppermost part of Þjórsárdalur valley, rests an oasis of lush vegetation and flowing waterfalls is an oasis known as Gjáin. Gjáin is a picturesque valley in Iceland with clear pools, powerful waterfalls, and surreal volcanic structures. Appearing as if out of nowhere, Gjáin seems to pop up like a colorful mirage in an expanse of lava fields. For television buffs, Gjáin was featured in an episode from the hit HBO show, Game of Thrones. In episode five of season four, you’ll recognize Gjáin from the scene where Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane come to a resting place before continuing their ongoing dispute. All in all, Gjáin is a dreamy place where the hustle and bustle of modern life can melt away in reverence of untouched nature and enchanting legends of elves and fairies who are said to call this oasis home.  Gjáin is just a 10-15 minute hike from the Saga Age Farm at Stöng. When visiting attractions in Southern Iceland—such as Háifoss and Hjálparfoss—this oasis makes for a great addition to your road trip. Visiting Gjáin is best done between the months of June and October, during the summer months. During the winter months, Gjáin is covered in snow and inaccessible. You also need 4-wheel drive to reach the valley. If you don't have 4-wheel drive, you can take a two-mile walk over relatively flat terrain to reach the valley.",

The long, winding path into the glacier was the brainchild of Baldvin Einarsson and Hallgrimur Örn Arngrímsson, who set out to give people a chance to explore inside a glacier. It took just five years from their initial idea for the sprawling ice cave to its completion in 2015, thanks to a number of eager investors that dropped more than two million dollars into the project. Burrowing into the western end of Langjokull, one of Iceland’s largest glaciers, and the second largest in Europe, the tunnel stretches over 1,800 feet into the heart of the ice, extending almost 100 feet below the surface. The tunnels are atmospherically lit to bring out the natural colors of the ice which shifts the deeper one gets. Once inside the glacier, the tunnels are reminiscent of the Hoth base from The Empire Strikes Back, but infinitely cooler because they are real. Once deep enough, the snowy white walls eventually shift to steely blue, which is a result of the ultra-dense glacial ice absorbing almost every color other than blue. Usually, this “blue ice” (not to be confused with mythological ice chunks that might fall from a plane), is hidden well away from normal view within the looser upper levels of glaciers. Here, the tunnels seem to be made of the stuff. Getting to the ice cave’s entrance requires a pick up by one of Into The Glacier’s eight-wheeled trucks that make stops in a selection of major towns before heading out to the cave mouth. The operators offer a number of different tour package options, but really anytime you get to explore the bowels of an ancient glacier is probably the right choice.",iceland exploration

Other observers have likened the shape of the volcano to an upturned boat, with Hekla’s two most active craters forming the keel. In the 16th century, the German scholar Caspar Peucer wrote that the entrance to hell could be found in “the bottomless abyss of Hekla Fell.” Such stories were common in the Middle Ages, many having been perpetuated following the dramatic eruption of 1104. Cistercian monks across Europe were familiar with this site, and in his 1180 volume “Liber De Miraculis,” Herbert de Clairvaux wrote of Hekla: “The renowned fiery cauldron of Sicily, which men call Hell’s chimney … that cauldron is affirmed to be like a small furnace compared to this enormous inferno.” Later, when the monk Benedict wrote about the voyages of Saint Brendan, Hekla is described as being the eternal prison of Judas. In 1341 the “Flatey Book Annal” described large birds that seemed to be flying in the volcano’s fires, and these were purported to be the souls of the damned. Most superstitions surrounding Hekla died out in the 19th century, though local folklore still tells of witches who gather on the volcano every year at Easter.",fiery wonders volcanoes natural wonders geology nature

Legend has it that the rocks are three trolls, caught out too late and frozen by the early morning sunlight. From the wild black beach at the foot of Vik, the towers can be seen off the misty coast to the west. A better view can be obtained by shimmying along the cliffs towards the Reynisdrangar, although this is a risky proposition due to the risk of falling rocks, steep slopes and rough surf. For the best view, take the road up the hill to the west of the town. A series of switchbacks leads to the top of the plateau, and a ten minute walk to the west yields not only a view of a black sea arch in the distance, but an overhead view of the three trolls. Let your legs dangle from the big cliff, and watch the gulls circle the Reynisdrangar as the surf crashes and sprays around the pillar’ base. Once at Vik, the pillars can be seen from the black beach.

From a distance, it looks like a colorful speck has settled atop the largest one. Look closer, and you’ll see it’s a tiny red-roofed lighthouse, perhaps one of the loneliest in the world. The whitewashed lighthouse is perched atop the tallest of the rocky cliffs, which stretches an impressive 120 feet upward. It’s off the coast of the Westman Islands, which themselves are about 4.5 miles from mainland Iceland. Because of its isolation, some on the internet have jokingly dubbed the beacon a haven for introverts. The remote lighthouse was built right before the dawn of World War II. Constructing this lonely lighthouse was no easy task, as helicopters had yet to take to the skies when the work began in 1938. Builders scaled the cliffs to reach the pillar’s pinnacle, laying out the groundwork by hand. They faced slick rocks, rain, and fervent winds knowing that one slip could send them plunging into the frigid North Atlantic Ocean that thrashed and splashed below. Now, thanks to advances in aviation, maintenance workers can take a helicopter to the far-flung beacon. Yet even still, visiting the Þrídrangaviti lighthouse is a daunting endeavor. One wrong step, and any unsuspecting explorers just may find themselves going for an unplanned swim with the killer whales that sometimes lurk within the waves.

Phone Booth,"Seydisfjordur, Iceland","An isolated, rusty phone booth commemorates Iceland's first international telegraph cable.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hows-it-going-phone-booth,"On the side of a small road heading north of Seyðisfjörður, you’ll find a rusty vintage phone booth set into the lee of a grassy hill. But no calls go in or out. The lonesome phone booth is a sculpture created by Icelandic artist Guðjón Ketilsson in 2006, the centennial of the first international telegraph cable in Iceland. Reaching from Scotland to Iceland, the underwater connection began Iceland’s telecommunications with the rest of the world. Inside the booth, you can see a small plaque, overgrown with moss and weeds, that reads,“Hvernig gengur?” The words translate to “How’s it going?” in English. Take Hafnargata Road northeast of Seyðisfjörður. The phone booth is found on the right side of the road, just before the Nord Marina Guesthouse.

40,Krafla,Iceland,This tumultuous Icelandic lava field looks so alien European researchers want to use it as a stand-in for Mars.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/krafla,"Located on the other side of the Ring Road from Námaskarð, the Krafla Caldera is a 10km long, 2km deep active volcanic zone on the boundary between the American and Eurasian tectonic plates, and a key component of the eerily Martian-like landscape of the Myvatn area. The Krafla zone comprises three sites: Leirbotn, the geothermal power station, Víti Maar, a volcanic crater ( its name means “Crater of Hell” in Icelandic), and Leirhnjúkur, a broad volcanic terrain with bubbling sulfuric pits and ashen lava fields. The Leirbotn plant has been active since the late seventies and is one of the five major power plants in Iceland that together supply about a quarter of the nation’s energy. Black and red lava fields, the unearthly bubbling pools of mud, volcanic craters, and gently wafting thermal plumes lend the Krafla zone a distinct sci-fi air, creating a scene where a primordial past appears to meet a sustainable future. It’s a reminder that Iceland is a bit like a part of the Earth they forgot to finish: with its unique location on the Mid-Atlantic ridge, atop two tectonic plates that are slowly pulling apart from each other, the island is a platform where more Earth is constantly spewing forth and cooling on the surface. A visit to Krafla is easily paired with its neighbor Námaskarð and rounded off with a plunge in Myvatn’s own hot spring, the Myvatn Nature Baths, a pleasantly low-key alternative to Iceland’s tourist-magnet, the Blue Lagoon. If you choose to hike in the region there are trails extending from Leirhnjúkur all the way past the Hverfjall crater to the Dimmu Borgir rock fields. Once funding is complete, the Krafla zone will host the European Mars Analog Research Station (Euro-MARS), the projected third such research station designed by the Mars Society to observe living conditions for human beings in Mars-like conditions.

41,Rauðfeldsgjá,Iceland,This mountain fissure hides a secret path to a secluded mossy grotto within the rock itself.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/raudfeldsgja,"Fantasy stories abound with tales of hidden passages leading to secret mountain chambers, but the Icelandic fissure known as Rauðfeldsgjá which allows access to a hidden stream source and damp green chamber may be one of the closest versions we’ll ever see in reality. Located on the Eastern side of the mountain known as Botnsfjall, this massive natural crack doesn’t immediately seem to be accessible from the ground. However, as visitors get closer to the base of the mount it becomes clear that the nearby stream is actually issuing from the fissure, and there is ample room for a human to get into the crack.  The gorge extends inside the Rauðfeldsgjá fissure for a ways until it narrows near to where the stream is issuing from. Within the split, the walls are covered with vibrant green moss and the imposing cliff walls looming on either side provide a truly unique sense of the sprawl and majesty of Iceland’s natural terrain. The hike to Rauðfeldsgjá can take about a half an hour from the road, but the trek is worth it to experience something people only usually see in fantasy movies. You can get into the fist part of the canyon rather easily, for those who wish to go further it may take a bit more physical ability. Depending on the season you go , you may want to bring rubber boots and other waterproof gear! The farther you get into the canyon the less room there is for the water and you may find yourself having to trek through the water to continue. Also, you'll run into a waterfall with a rope hanging down it, depending on the season, if the waterfall is at full power, it can be a incredibly wet and awakening experience trying to climb it.",mountains

This secluded shore sits in northern Iceland and is marked by a small sign that simply reads, “fossil.” If visitors can locate the small sign and follow it towards the lone wharf-house that sits nearby, they will find a veritable national history museum embedded in the sea cliff wall. There among the gray stone are countless shells, prehistoric impressions, and other primordial relics. Deposited in ancient epochs when the sea level either shrunk to expose the chitinous fossils or the biological debris simply washed up towards the seawall, they represent millions of years of natural history exposed like a cross-section. This remarkable display is open to anyone willing to seek it out, but given the fragility of the site, tampering with or removing anything is strictly prohibited. However, Hallbjarnarstaðakambur offers a sort of time travel that is almost unheard of elsewhere in the world.  The fossils are not signed and so are not easy to find. Best to use GPS 66.145539°, -17.259286°. Directions are as follows: the fossils are about 11-12 km north of Husavik on Route 85. If heading north, look for an (easy to miss) narrow & rough track on the left down to the coastline, marked Tjörneshöfn (Tungulending Guesthouse). Just after the guesthouse is a small wharf.

Situated on the north side of Iceland’s Lake Myvatn, this geothermal wonder of hot sulfuric mud springs and steam springs (solfataras and fumaroles if you’re a geology nerd) is otherworldly. Black rivers and bubbling pools of sulfuric mud cut through a landscape that’s rich with colorful minerals and is continuously steaming. While picturesque,  one of Námaskarð’s most notable characteristics simply cannot be captured by photography – the smell. Oh, the smell! The eggy stench from the sulphuric mud and steam is pungent and unrelenting. It’s enough to make you woozy if you get too close to a steam vent. There’s a reason why you won’t find vegetation in Námaskarð. Take one deep breath in and you’ll know right away.

44,Búðakirkja,Iceland,This black church sits alone among a field of lava rock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/budakirkja,"On the south coast of Iceland’s Snæfellsnes peninsula, there’s a village with only a hotel and a tiny black church called the Búðakirkja. On paper, the hamlet of Búðir doesn’t sound like much, especially when compared to Snæfellsjökull, the dormant ice-capped volcano looming nearby, but what Búðir lacks in infrastructure it more makes up for in its surreal, dreamlike landscape, epitomized the singular Búðakirkja. Búðir sits within the Búðahraun lava field, an expansive environment of torn-up earth that has grown over with grassy flora. One could easily imagine creatures from fairy tales living amongst the jagged rock formations and in the deep holes that have formed here. Visitors can walk along the fields and down to the coastline along trails that look and feel unending. In the summer months, the peculiar “drumming” calls of the Common Snipe can sometimes be heard, which only adds to the unreal feeling about the place. The first Búðakirkja was built on the spot in 1703, but was eventually deconstructed due to the area lack of parishioners. The current church was reconstructed in 1987 after a single member of the church lobbied to have the chapel brought back. It has a historic graveyard as well as relics such as a bell and chalice from the time the church was first erected. However its pure black paint job and isolated location are the real attraction to the site.",churches nature sacred spaces

Originally known as the Globe IV, the large ship was completed in Norway in 1912 as a state-of-the-art-at-the-time whaling vessel. The hull was specially reinforced to break through the icy Southern seas in which it operated and the powerful engine kept the boat sailing even in calm waters. During its active lifetime it was sold around to a number of different countries before finding an Icelandic owner after World War II. Once whaling restrictions became more widespread, Garðar BA 64 (a name it finally received in 1963) was used for fishing herring in the waters off of Iceland. After decades in faithful service to its bevy of owners, Garðar BA 64 was finally deemed unsafe for service in 1981 and as opposed to being scuttled, the old ship was run aground in Skápadalur Valley where it remains to this day, falling apart bit by bit. It is now a popular site for photographers and anyone looking for a lovely mix of Icelandic scenery and industrial ruin.  On Beach accessible by road 612",shipwrecks ships beaches ruins
46,Snæfellsjökull,Iceland,A formerly glacier-tipped volcano that inspired none other than Jules Verne.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snaefellsjokull,"120 kilometers northeast of Reykjavik lies Snæfellsjökull, a 700,000 year old volcano whose glacier-topped peak inspired Jules Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth. Composed of layered lava, ash and other volcanic elements, the caustic mountain has preserved its conic shape despite having been largely dormant since around 200 CE. Unlike most volcanoes which harbor a steaming caldera at their apex, Snæfellsjökull’s top has traditionally been covered by a glacier. Indeed, the mountain’s very name translates to “Snæfells glacier.” Unfortunately due to rising temperatures in the area, 2012 marked the first year in recorded history that the summit of the mountain was completely free of ice. The whole area is full of amazing lava formations and caves, and there are organized trips to the summit, 1448 meters above the surrounding rocky plains. Snæfellsjökull has long been one of Iceland’s most famous natural wonders and was even cited as the entrance to the wondrous Earth’s core in Jules Verne’s 1864 book A Journey to the Center of the Earth. The adventurers in the novel use the Stromboli volcano as their exit from the fantasy land, but their entrance to the underworld remains one of Iceland’s most awesome features.",volcanoes literature geology
47,Arctic Circle Marker,Iceland,A giant concrete orb in far north Iceland marks the ever-shifting boundary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arctic-circle-marker,"Marking the geographic boundary of the Arctic Circle isn’t an easy job. It’s a constantly moving target, shifting with the Earth’s movement. And although the line is marked on maps at approximately 66.5 degrees north from the equator, its location is actually moving about 45 feet per year due to the fluctuating tilt of the Earth’s axis Above the Arctic Circle, the sun doesn’t set on the summer solstice or rise on the winter solstice. As you get further north, the continuous day and night gets longer, reaching a full six months at the North Pole. But how, exactly, do you mark the boundary of the Arctic pole? The city of Akureyri in North Iceland had the clever idea to do so with an art piece that will move right along with that ever-changing tilt. The work, called “Orbis et Globus” (Latin for “Circle and Sphere”), is a giant concrete orb weighing nearly nine tons, installed on North Iceland’s Grímsey Island. The plan is to have it moved each year to reflect the Arctic Circle’s shifting position. However, moving a 9-ton concrete sphere is no easy feat. Getting a sculpture of that size to the island was as difficult as you’d imagine. According to the Iceland Review, on its first journey to the island Orbis et Globus nearly rolled off of its transport truck and into the ocean. The idea of moving the sculpture was initially scrapped when this happened. But the residents of Grímsey Island—all 100 of them—persevered, and in September 2017, the sculpture was officially dedicated. In addition to the orb, there are also three smaller stones marking the previous Arctic Circle boundaries on the island. Each stone is inscribed with a date: 1717, 1817 and 1917, marking the movement each century. But this recognition of the island’s place in the Arctic Circle won’t be around forever. Although Grímsey has been in the Arctic Circle for 300 years, it’s not staying there. By 2047, the circle will have moved north of the island, not to return for 20,000 years.",concrete spheres arctic circle geographic markers science sculptures art
48,Öskjuvatn and Viti Lakes,Iceland,Two volcanic lakes in an enormous crater formed in a prehistoric eruption.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oskjuvatn-and-viti-lakes,"These two lakes, Öskjuvatn and Víti, are situated in an enormous crater, around 50 square kilometers, formed in a prehistoric eruption. The area is still a very active volcanic area, the most recent eruption having been in 1961. The largest historical eruption was in 1875, causing a wave of emigration from Iceland. Seismic activity on the northeastern rim of the caldera has been increasing lately, hinting at the possibility of an upcoming eruption. The large lake, Öskjuvatn, used to be the deepest lake in Iceland at 220m. However, the famous lagoon, Jökulsárlón in the southeast of Iceland, surpassed it as the deepest two years ago. The small lake Víti (E. Hell) is popular among tourists for bathing. It was formed in the eruption in 1875 and parts of it are still boiling. If you go there do not take a bath unless there is some wind as carbon dioxide can collect above the surface causing swimmers to pass out. It’s sometimes called the only nudist beach in Iceland. There are two mountain huts and a campsite at Dreki, by Drekagil, which is about 100 km by a 4x4 F-road, from the Icelandic golden circle road. The road continues 8 km up from Dreki into the Askja caldera. It is a walk of about 2.5 km from the car park to Öskjuvatn and Víti. The roads are usually only open for about three to four months, from late June until early October.",lakes water
49,Krýsuvíkurbjarg (Krýsuvík Cliffs),Iceland,The summer tourists on these cliffs are thousands of seabirds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/krysuvikurbjarg-krysuvik-cliffs,"Harsh winds and cold ocean spray don’t ruffle the feathers of the thousands of birds who come to summer on Krýsuvíkurbjarg. Reaching the cliffs requires a bumpy drive or a long walk across the lava fields, dotted with bubbling geothermal pools steaming from the volcano below. The cliffs appear from suddenly, a dramatic drop from the grassy lawn straight down to the sea crashing against the rock face. The wind blows fiercely. These conditions might seem inhospitable, but that’s far from the case for the birds that migrate here in the summers. Every year around 60,000 seabirds come to the cliffs to mate. Depending on the season, visitors can see guillemots and other auks, puffins, seagulls, European shags, sandpipers, and peewits. The birds tuck themselves into the tiniest crevices in the cliff face, making themselves at home despite the odds. What’s more, thanks to Iceland’s “midnight sun,” you can enjoy the view practically any time of day.",cliffs rock formations birds rocks geology animals
50,Hengifoss,Iceland,The bright red stripes streaking across the rocks are the star feature at this Icelandic waterfall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hengifoss,"It may be the third tallest waterfall in Iceland, but it’s not the breathtaking height of Hengifoss that motivates explorers to trek an hour and a half uphill to see it. People head to this natural wonder to admire the horizontal stripes streaking across the rock behind it, which form something resembling a strange, multilayer lava sandwich. Iceland was and is to this day a volcanic hotspot. This volcanic activity on the island has created impressive geological formations over the eons, and the red lines that backdrop Hengifoss are one such marvel. Years and years ago, volcanic ash settled upon the ground in the areas of Hengifoss and eventually turned into soil, which became rich in clay and iron. When the next volcanic eruption occurred, the iron reacted with the oxygen and formed the reddish layer seen in the rock. Repeat this cycle a few times, and you’ve got a wall of black volcanic rock with red lines denoting the eruptions of the past, like a calendar of lava. On its own, this unique rock formation would have been worth the visit, but with the added aesthetic of a waterfall pouring 420 feet down its center, this site is a must-visit destination in eastern Iceland. The hike there even features a bonus waterfall, one that rushes over a collection of hexagonal basalt columns. Formed as lava cools and hardens, these columns are commonly found throughout Iceland, although they’re perhaps most famously found at the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland.  It's an uphill trek to get to the waterfall. There's a small parking lot near the start of the 1.5-mile trail to the falls (see here for a map of the trail). Fair warning: the parking lot fills up fast during the peak of the high season (July), but you should be able to easily snag a spot during other months. The parking lot has toilets.

Over one million birds pepper the wind-battered crags, protected from predators while perched within the rocks that jut out from their towering domain. The puffins, of course, are typically the star attraction. The adorable orange-beaked creatures are fairly comfortable around the humans who brave the fierce winds that tear through the air. You’ll typically find them peeping out from the grass that coats the top parts of the cliffs. Látrabjarg is a key site for seabird conservation. In addition to the puffins, you’ll find other seabirds like guillemots, razorbills, and northern gannets clustered throughout the rocks. At times, the area houses approximately 40 percent of the world’s razorbill population. The cliffs also boast splendid hiking and photography opportunities for those who can stand the wind. The nearly nine miles of over 1,000-foot-tall cliffs offer a chance to walk Iceland’s most western perimeter. Be sure to stop for a bit to take in the views of the Atlantic Ocean, which merges uninterrupted with the distant horizon. If you do decide to walk along the cliffs, make sure you stay behind the white line that’s painted near the edge. It’s there to keep you from accidentally falling and plummeting into the churning waters far below.  Accessible by dirt road.

52,Tvísöngur,"Seydisfjordur, Iceland",These concrete domes were installed on an Icelandic bluff to honor a very specific musical tradion.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tvisongur,"Berlin artist Lukas Kühne’s bulbous sculpture known as Tvísöngur, mixes concrete, nature, and sound to create an interactive tribute to Iceland’s unique tradition of five-tone harmony. Unveiled in 2012, the installation piece looks like a grouping of interconnected cement bubbles from afar. Up close the five segments are actually quite large, ranging from roughly 6 to 12 feet tall and can be entered via rounded arches built into the walls. Once inside the stark industrial domes, visitors will find that they have each been designed to resonate at different harmonies as the wind blowing in off the cliff rushes through the openings. The collective effect is almost as though the wind itself is playing a giant instrument. The five chambers of the piece are meant to recall the Icelandic musical tradition of quintal harmony, with each dome reflecting a tone in the tradition. Juxtaposed with the serene and stark surroundings, it seems as though Iceland itself is creating the music. Tvísöngur is a permanent work and is meant to keep the country’s musical traditions alive, which is not an easy thing to do simply with concrete.",music sculptures
53,Selatangar,Iceland,Eerie ruins of an abandoned medieval fishing village crumble atop an unforgiving stretch of earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/selatangar,"A stretch of lava rocks and black sand holds the last remnants of a once-thriving fishing village. The abandoned settlement has an eerie atmosphere, with rough seas and raging winds adding a distinct air of danger. Every spring, from the Middle Ages up until 1884, fishermen descended upon the rocky earth at Selatangar. The men spent their days reaping the sea’s bounty, retiring to land to rest and store their equipment while the same turbulent waters they harvested thrashed along the nearby shore. They lived in ramshackle stone huts that looked more like caves than homes. It was a stark, dreary existence. The ocean made its fury known, and the exposed settlement was forced to endure furious winds and a harsh, often wet climate. After Iceland began industrializing in the 19th century, Selatangar, like many other fishing villages, was abandoned. Now, all that remains is a handful of crumbling stone huts scattered around the site. Modern explorers who stumble upon the rugged ruins can clearly envision the harrowing conditions those who lived within the village once faced. It’s easy to understand how the unforgiving environment gave rise to legends of ghostly hauntings. According to some, a ghost named Tanga Tomas still roams what remains of the village. The village is located on the southern coast of the Reykjanes Peninsula. It's about 10 minutes east of Grindavik, down 427. You'll see a sign indicating the path that leads down to the parking lot on your right. You will need a four-wheel drive car to get there. Once parked, walk down a path of sand, hopefully marked by footprints, toward the coast. Don't worry about getting lost; as long as you continue south toward the ocean from the parking lot you should see the village. Similarly, your car will be very visible on the walk back north.",ghost stories fishing villages abandoned ruins
54,Gunnuhver,"Reykjanes, Iceland",Iceland's largest geothermal mud pool is a little bit haunted and a little bit dangerous.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gunnuhver,"Iceland is a cap atop a brewing geothermal field, the place where hot gases bubble out from deep within the earth through fissures in its tectonic plates. This phenomenon created the country’s famous geysers and hot springs, the largest of which is Gunnuhver. Gunnuhver measures 65 feet across and is constantly spewing dense, cloudy steam at a scalding 570˚F. It is unique from Iceland’s other hot springs in that it is entirely seawater, due to its proximity to the ocean. The surrounding rocks are impressive as well, colored dazzling oranges and blues from unusual minerals. But its natural majesty isn’t the only reason Gunnuhver is famous. It has a ghost story as well, which gave the hot spring its name. The legend goes that an old woman named Gudrun, “Gunna” for short, lived in a small community on the Reykjanes peninsula sometime in the 18th century. She was largely disliked, and was suspected of being a witch because there was always something brewing in her pot. Shortly before her death, a judge paid Gunn a visit and ended up in a dispute with her. That same judge attended Gunn’s funeral and was discovered dead the next morning, his body bruised and mutilated. The old woman’s ghost was to blame, and she didn’t stop there. Her spirit terrorized the peninsula, wreaking mayhem. It wasn’t until the locals plied a priest with liquor that they found a solution to trap Gudrun. Per the priest’s advice, they left a loose end from a ball of twine for the ghost to grab hold of. She did, and the ball rolled into the hot spring, taking the witch’s ghost with it and trapping her there forever. The hot spring takes its name from the old woman (Gunnuhver translates to “Gunn’s hot spring”). Some say that Gudrun’s ghost didn’t fall into the boiling pit, but that she’s hanging on to the edge for all eternity. The steam is constant and thick enough that it would certainly obscure any ghostly figures in or outside Gunnuhver. Visitors can view the hot spring from several wooden observation platforms nearby. Gunnuhver was entirely closed to the public in 2006 when the spring became more active and expanded, consuming a portion of the platforms. Today the hot spring’s activity has decreased, and Gunnuhver is supposedly safe for the time being. But it can be hard to tell when Gudrun will climb from the spring again.  As you drive west from Grindavik the coast road turns to the north and passes a large geothermal plant. Take the first left after the plant and then the first left again. You will reach a T junction with the Reykjanesviti lighthouse easily visible on top of a hill to your right. Turn left into the parking area.

But don’t be fooled by its modest exterior. Its flag proudly indicates that you’ve arrived at the “temple of fortune-tellers.” When you enter, you’re greeted by two crows and a humble broomstick on display. There is a small seating area with reading material and a room devoted to teas, coffees, and various witchy (or otherwise) Icelandic trinkets. There is also a small café. The museum is staffed by any number of its five founding ladies, only two of which are admitted spákona—fortune tellers. They are quick to correct you on the difference between “psychic medium” and “fortune-telling.” While psychic mediums glean their powers from mystic hidden realms, a fortune teller is merely a “vessel” by which the wisdom of the objects like runes, tarot, cups, and intestines is interpreted. You are free to roam the museum at no charge. Around the museum are many exquisitely painted murals detailing the life and mythology of Þórdís, the local 10th-century prophetess. For a modest fee, a guide will interpret the murals for you and tell you about the prophetess, who every day climbed the mountain Spákonufell to brush her hair with a golden comb. There are separate rooms devoted to different divination practices: tarot, palmistry, and coffee or tea leaves. Paying visitors may have their past, present, and future laid out for them. There are also small placards in both English and Icelandic that teach various divination techniques both across the world and unique to Iceland.

The island of Grímsey is said to have been settled by a farmer named Grímur, who came to the island from Norway. According to legend, the island was populated by giants and trolls when Grímur arrived, and he slew them all and took the daughter of one of them as his bride. The hardiness of Grímsey fishermen is traced back to this legend. Fewer than 100 people call the five-square-kilometer island home today, but it is a popular destination for those who wish to visit the Arctic Circle. Arctic Circle visitors get a certificate commemorating their crossing, and there is a signpost saying how far major cities around the world are from that point. Cliffs along Grímsey’s coastline, which are home to thousands of birds, including auks and puffins, also attract tourists. Whales are often visible from these cliffs. A cave, called Prestaskvompa (Priest’s Hollow) runs under the whole length of Grímsey, and the surface of the island is mostly green, though it has no trees, only grasses, mosses, and marshland. The Grímsey church was built from driftwood in 1867 and renovated in 1932. Other fascinating sites include the 1937 lighthouse, the remains of a windmill (intended as a source of electricity) built in 1973, and a monument to American chess enthusiast Daniel Willard Fiske, who became a patron of the isolated island when he learned that chess was an important part of the Grímsey lifestyle. Among his acts of patronage was to give a chess set to every Grímsey home. Fishing is the dominant industry on the island, and most of the men are involved with it. Women are, too, but with fewer than a hundred people on the island, women also have to take on most of the other roles. The local souvenir shop carries crafts made by women and a local women’s association takes care of accommodations for visitors spending one or more nights in the Community Hall. Both guesthouses on the island are also run by women. Grímsey children go to school on the island through eighth grade, after which point they continue their education in Akureyri on the mainland.  A ferry makes trips to the island from the mainland throughout the week, and regular flights are also available from Air Iceland. Since some tourists only stay a few hours, planes have been known to sit and wait as long as their passengers are still enjoying the sights.",arctic circle fishing legends islands

Located in a former library building built on a coastal promontory, this long term installation by American artist Roni Horn, is both an art piece and natural history collection. The piece consists of three distinct parts: One area collects audio recordings (accompanied by visual displays) of Icelandic weather as reported by the local people around the town of Stykkishólmur, where the exhibition is located, creating an interactive self-portrait of the area. Accenting this display is the floor of the main room which is made of rubber etched with both English and Icelandic words pertaining to the weather. The centerpiece of the site is the titular “Library of Water” which is kept in floor-to-ceiling clear cylinders. Each pillar standing throughout the main room is filled with water that was melted from one of Iceland’s 24 glaciers. Every tube holds the liquid of a single glacier, allowing visitors to take a sort of tour all across Iceland right in one room. Given that the mineral and chemical content of each glacier’s melt is different, each of the over-sized vials has essentially captured a very specific portion of the country for posterity and eventually, historical interest.

58,Harpa,"Reykjavik, Iceland",This stunning concert hall has become a symbol of Iceland's national recovery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/harpa,"It’s to be expected that a lot of controversy would go into opening a 164-million Euro concert venue and conference hall in the midst of a horrific economic recession. But now that the hubbub surrounding the conditions in which Harpa was created have quieted down, it’s undeniable that Reykjavík’s temple uniting humans and sound is uniquely stunning. Dreams of a noteworthy music house in Iceland’s capital city date back to 1881, but the timing to finally make those dreams a reality couldn’t have been worse. When the planning stages for Harpa began back in the mid-2000s, Danish architectural firm Henning-Larsen and Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson included plans for not only a concert venue, but also luxury apartments on-site, a hotel with 400 rooms, plus retail space and a site-exclusive parking lot. However, as ground was being broken on the project, Iceland’s economy experienced a full-on collapse — and unlike most everywhere else in the world, banks and corporations weren’t given a bailout by the Icelandic government, which left the island nation in a unique fiscal position. While Iceland’s economy sorted itself out, Harpa was left to languish in a half-built purgatory. Such was the case until 2009, when the government rescued the project, amidst an uproar from its citizens. By the time the concert hall was completed, Harpa became, in the words of its artist creator, “a conference centre with some music on the side” rather than the other way around, as first envisioned. Though that may seem like a crippling compromise, it’s worth considering the sheer amount of praise the structure receives, particularly as it fundamentally transformed the skyline of a city like Reykjavík. Design buffs immediately fawned over Harpa for its rare ability to look better in real life than in architectural sketches. Sound nerds continue to adore it for the attention paid to the theater’s acoustics (read: it’s as functional as it is formally pleasing). And then there are the economists, who are blown away by the fact of its sheer existence. Perched on the edge of Reykjavík’s bustling harbor, where massive ships can be seen entering or leaving port at all hours from inside the building’s honeycombed glass walls, Harpa is worth exploring even if there’s nary a concert or conference to be had. There’s no bad time to get lost within its sleek, hive-like innards, or watch these ships from unknown origins come and go from the shelter of a glistening windbreak that has proven truly remarkable on every level.",design music architecture
59,Ásatrú Temple,"Reykjavik, Iceland","Iceland's first pagan temple in 1,000 years is underway in Reykjavík.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/asatru-pagan-temple,"Of the many construction projects in development in Reykjavík, the most extraordinary has to be the sanctuary for the Ásatrú religion, the first pagan temple erected in Iceland in a millennium. The sanctuary will be the central hub of the Ásatrú society, a neopagan spiritual organization that has restored the ancient religion of the Vikings based in the pantheon of the Nordic gods. Nordic paganism was suppressed in 999 with the rise of Christianity, but faith in the power of nature and supernatural entities persisted in the countryside and isolated areas. Today, a modern version of the ancient religion is on the rise. Founded on the first day of summer in 1972, the Ásatrú society (Ásatrúarfélagid in Icelandic) now has almost 5,000 active members and is the fastest growing religion in Iceland. And soon, it will have a dedicated structure for ceremonies and gatherings. The Ásatrú temple—or more accurately, hall (or “hof” in Icelandic)—will honor the ancient gods such as Odin, Thor, Frigg, and Baldur. It is still under construction as of this writing and estimated to be completed by the fall of 2019. The sanctuary will be situated on the Öskjuhlíd hill, on a magnificent site surrounded by forests and a panoramic view of the sea. The area is considered sacred, as it is near an ensemble of three rocks believed to relate to the life and powers of Odin, the supreme god in the Nordic pantheon. Designed by architect Magnús Jensson, the temple will be a monument to the cosmic forces of nature. It includes a spectacular dome aligned with astronomical events. The numbers three and nine, considered magical, have a special significance in the construction, according to the principles of sacred geometry. The interior of the temple will be a sober and majestic space hosting the statues of the deities, under the changing sunlight depending on the season and time of day. A commemorative memorial also stands at the entrance of the temple as a tribute to Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson, the founder of the society and first “Allsherjargodi,” or highest priest. Rituals, known as “blóts,” will be held at the temple, from weddings to feasts to funerals. The most important rituals are the first day of summer (“Victory blót”) and the winter solstice (“Yule blót”). Though the structure is not yet complete, some rituals have already be held at the site, such as a ceremony to thank Mother Nature for the wood used for the construction. The Ásatrú sanctuary will also be open and welcoming to other religions and institutions. Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, the current Allsherjargodi, stresses that Ásatrú is a religion of tolerance and peace. He plans to invite artists, musicians, and writers from across Iceland to the opening ceremony planned for 2019, is confident that the new temple will contribute to a more diverse and respectful society for the future Icelandic generations.  Go to Perlan Hill and hike south, and you will find the temple construction site. It is located not far from Reykjavík University.",gods paganism vikings temples religion sacred spaces

There are long stretches of this national road where there’s nothing around for miles, just the vast, empty landscape. Along one of these remote stretches, between Höfn and Egilsstadir in eastern Iceland, a bizarre sight cuts through the isolation. A giant red chair is inexplicably bolted to a rock in the middle of a mossy field. There are few buildings around and a whole lot of sheep. A small pull-off is all that marks it as a stopping place, and there is no indication as to why the chair was placed there. The oversized chair is taller than a human being, and the bright red pops against the blue sky. The back of the chair faces the Atlantic Ocean, and some mountains can be seen in the distance, completing this picturesque—if surreal— scene.

Consisting of over 20 turf structures that are still standing, the Keldur farm has existed for almost a thousand years. The location is featured prominently in the historic Njal’s Saga, which states that the location was founded in the year 1,000 CE, although current estimates place the settlement as much older. Keldur Hall is believed to have been built during the 11th-century, however, which would make it the oldest hall of its kind in all of Iceland. The hall was likely inhabited by Jon Loftsson, a strongly religious chieftain from the 12th century. The site has been added to, preserved, and generally cared for over its centuries of existence, but it was not until 1932 that the most remarkable feature was discovered. Set into the floor, where it is said that it would have been beneath a throne of some sort, is the entrance to a skinny escape tunnel. The crude emergency tunnel leads down and into the hill behind the hall, allowing one to flee to the opposite base of the hill. The opening is quite small, so it is unknown how effective it would have been. Keldur Hall and the surrounding farm are now under the purview of the National Museum of Iceland, and visitors can check out the escape hole, but it is grated over, so a quick getaway might be a bit more challenging.",architectural oddities architecture

The rocky field gets its name from a part of the Icelandic Eyrbyggia Saga. As the tale goes, a 10th century farmer had two Berserkers, laborers from Sweden who were known for their large size and general aggressiveness, who worked for him.  One of the men fell in love with the farmer’s daughter and asked to marry her and while the farmer wanted to refuse he was a little afraid of doing so. He consulted with the local chieftain who suggested he allow the marriage IF the Berserker would first complete a certain (he believed impossible) task: forging a road through the lava field so that the farmer wouldn’t have to travel such a long distance around it when he wanted to get to the other side. The Berserker agreed, and he and his compatriot set to work right away, putting all their “berserk” aggressive energy to the task. They finished in no time. Simultaneously pleased about the road and alarmed by his prospective son-in-law, the farmer invited the two Berserkers to relax their tired muscles in a special sauna he had built for them. However this was a trap and the farmer killed and buried them both. The road, and their supposed burial place, can still be found crossing Berserkjahraun. Modern archeological excavation of the site even found the remains of two large men, lending a surprising amount of credibility to the historical veracity of the tale.

Since before the time of the Vikings, the Kjolur Trail, which runs from North to South between two mountainous glaciers has been a popular way to travel across the barren highland deserts of Iceland. Early reports from the time of the Sagas tell of small armies that would use the road to hurry to and fro from conflict to conflict. However, it was during the 18th century when the road began to gain true notoriety. It is rumored that during this period the famous Icelandic outlaw Fjalla-Eyvindur and his wife took up residence along a portion of the road that is now known as the “Valley of Thieves.” In addition to its connection to those criminals, there is also a tale of two travelers who were guiding their flock of 100 sheep along the road and got caught in a snowstorm. Both the shepherds and their flock perished along the way which also created a site known as “Bone Hill.” After this era, the road fell off the map so to speak for almost 100 years before being rediscovered in the 19th century and has since been a popular road for hikers and other visitors. The geography of the area is also of note for the fields of hot springs and geothermal pools that occur along the way. There are also a number of huts and rock formations that can be visited while traveling on the road. So whether trekkers are looking to walk in the footsteps of history or just to find some nice photo opportunities, the Ancient Kjolur Trail has hundreds of years of answers.",hot springs roads water nature

In 2009, Icelandic artist Sigurður Guðmundsson created the 34 enormous eggs in honor of the 34 species of bird that nest within the area. Each stone specimen accurately depicts the shape, patterns, and colors of the individual bird egg it represents. The eggs, though differing slightly in appearance, are all close to the same size. Except, that is, for one. The sculpture honoring the red-throated diver, the official bird of Djúpivogur, is larger than the rest.

66,Abandoned Djúpavík Herring Factory,Iceland,This rusting remnant of the local herring industry is being given a second life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-djupavik-herring-factory,"Getting to the remote Icelandic village of Djúpavík entails traveling miles away from the nearest town on a bumpy, narrow, winding dirt road through a desolate landscape of fjords, sheep, and little else. This isolated village built up around its herring factory, and has risen and fallen with the local fishing industry throughout the 20th century. The now-abandoned herring processing factory in Djúpavík was the biggest one in Iceland—in fact, the biggest concrete structure in Iceland, period—when it opened in 1935. But that new-and-improved building was actually the second herring factory in the village, which was first settled in 1917 around the fishing industry, but abandoned when business slowed. The new factory opened in 1935, fitted with all the latest modern equipment for processing herring. But when the staff of around 300 moved to the sleepy village to work in the impressive factory, they were surprised by the surrounding town’s complete lack of churches, police, or even a mayor. Over the next several years, a town was built up around the factory. But by the late 1940s, the herring were all but gone from Húnaflói bay, and the factory folded in 1954. The town of Djúpavík was abandoned by 1968. Then in 1985, Eva Sigurbjörnsdóttir and her husband Ásbjörn Þorgilsson became the village’s only year-round residents. They turned the former women’s quarters into a hotel, and began refurbishing the old factory and other buildings. Hotel Djúpavík now offers tours through the giant, rusting old factory. Today the space features artworks and installations, and hosts “the Factory” every summer, an event with concerts, events, and exhibitions with works from artists around the world. In 2006, Sigur Rós played an intimate show there for a crowd of 300 people who made the trek out to Djúpavík. You will need a car to get to Djúpavík on the bumpy, pothole-filled, narrow, and winding dirt road that oftentimes hair-raisingly hugs the cliffs. The road is closed in winter months.

67,Randulf's Sea House,"Eskifjörður, Iceland",This remote eatery and museum is preserved as a time capsule of a small Icelandic fishing town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/randulf-s-sea-house,"Nestled within the municipality of Fjarðabyggð, the town of Eskifjörður is known locally for its fishing trade, which was the biggest source of income for the area before the arrival of a nearby aluminum smelter back in 2007. But while big industry has begun to encroach on the identity of the area, the locals have done a terrific job of maintaining the relics of the town’s maritime past. One example of this is Randulf’s Sea House, a wonderful walk-in museum, which acts as a time capsule of generations gone by. Originally used as a lodging and herring processing building for fishermen in the late 1800s, the building now serves mainly as a place to grab some food during the summer months and for functions in the winter. The Sea House serves up traditional Icelandic dishes like shark and reindeer in a setting that is not unlike stepping back in time. The first floor of the building acts as the eatery, while the second floor holds preserved fishermen’s quarters. They are decked out in the personal artifacts and other memorabilia belonging to their former tenants. There are books, photographs, and tools, as well as the still-unmade bunk beds. It’s as if the quarters are still anticipating the return of their original owners, a homecoming that will never occur. The quarters are particularly well-preserved thanks to the neglect of the original owner of the space, a Norwegian man named Randulf. As the herring industry in the area went into decline and the upper chambers were no longer much needed, he essentially left them alone meaning the upstairs area of the building was largely untouched for a period of around 70 years. In 1980, the East Iceland Museum Society bought into the aging fish house, restoring the exterior and the attached jetty. By the 2000s the museum society had taken over the space entirely, opening it to the public as a cultural heritage space. Today the building stands as a proud reminder of the town’s past. Behind its unassuming exterior lurks an opportunity for visitors to step back in time to a much simpler period, prior to the industrialization of Iceland and the East Fjords.

Mossy, narrow paths weave among the graveyard as dappled light falling through the trees illuminates lichen-covered gravestones. And on a cloudy, rainy autumn day, Holavallagarour is gray, mysterious, and even ominous. Also sometimes called the Old Churchyard, Hólavallagarður opened in 1838 as Reykjavik’s new cemetery, replacing a burial ground used since Viking times. The city placed the graveyard on a small hill a couple of blocks off the city’s central pond. Some of Iceland’s most famous sculptors, including Einar Jónsson, carved gravestones here. For the next century and a half, Hólavallagarður was the most important graveyard in Iceland. Jón Sigurðsson, the father of Icelandic independence, is buried here, as is Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval, Iceland’s most famous painter, and Ingibjorg Bjarnason, the first woman member of parliament. The graveyard also houses victims of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, as well as a handsome monument to French sailors lost at sea.  The cemetery was fully booked by the early 1930s, but families that bought their plots before then can still bury their dead here. What makes Hólavallagarður particularly special is that in a country with hardly any trees, it is practically a forest. Graves are kept company by drooping willows, spruces and poplars, and especially birch and rowan trees. There’s an Icelandic tradition that the first person buried in a graveyard is its guardian and will protect all the dead who come after. Holavallagarour’s guardian is Guðrún Oddsdóttir, who died in 1838, the year the cemetery opened.  Hólavallagarður is always open.",graveyards burial places trees cemeteries plants

But according to Icelandic folklore, it did not get there naturally. It is said a semi-legendary outlaw tore it from Mount Hrútafell and dropped it there. But the myths around Drangurinn Rock don’t stop with its strange arrival at its current location. The caves beneath the rock, where human farmers would keep their cows and hay, are said to have been home to elves. According to the myths, the elves cared for cows that gave birth overnight, and did not like human interference. Farmers who left their cows to give birth would return to find mother and calf safe in the morning. Those who interrupted the process might have the calves thrown at them, and farmers who didn’t leave would have something happen that would force them out, or they would be made to fall asleep. One man, a farmhand, is said to have gotten to know the elves quite well, and reported that they were a lot like humans and just as beautiful.

71,Drangey Island,Iceland,An Icelandic island full of diving birds and legend.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drangey-island,"What happens to volcanoes when their fiery lives come to an end? In the case of Drangey island, it becomes a weird and wonderful island full of exotic birds, irresistible outlaw stories, and legends of giants. Long ago in Skagafjörður, northern Iceland, a mighty volcano died, and over the millennia it crumbled and washed into the sea—all but the round rock core of its magma passage. 700,000 years later, the corpse of this powerful force of nature became a symbol of spring and life for nearby Icelanders. Every year as winter passes, a rich variety of birds nest in the rugged nooks and crannies of the island, and every year locals head to the island to collect eggs, go fowling, and do some serious fishing in between. The haul of fowl is most commonly diving birds, but the island is also a nesting site for falcons, puffin, and ravens. The island attracts riffraff as well. Famous outlaw Grettir Ásmundarson (commonly known as Grettir the Strong) lived and died on Drangey Island, and his story is a much loved Icelandic tale. The bad tempered, redheaded brute was the son of a Viking, and his life story is told from beginning to end in the Grettis Saga. While Grettir was, for the most part, portrayed as a gruff but lovable rogue, he was said to be responsible for a hall fire that killed several men and forced him into outlawry. The outlaw hid with his brother and slave on the isolated island for 20 years, giving him a longevity that was virtually unheard of. Eventually, his enemies caught up with him, and he was assassinated on one of Drangey’s rocky cliffs. The Grettis Saga was the first but certainly not the last literary reference to the volcano island. While we know the origins of the geology, there is also a fascinating legend about the Island of Drangey, involving night trolls that become stone statues when the day breaks. The giant trolls had a treasured cow that they wished to breed, and so when the cow was finally old enough and went into heat, the night trolls began the journey across the fjord to a waiting bull. The husband and wife troll team found themselves up against a very unwilling, stubborn animal, and as the long trip across the water proceeded, the cow’s slow gait exposed all three to the sun’s morning rays, and they petrified where they stood, now making up the pillars of rock at each end of the island. The pillars, named Kerlingin (the old woman) and Karlinn (the old man) after the two doomed giants, stood until the 18th century when Karlinn collapsed into the waters. Kerlingin still remains. While snaring is now illegal, locals still head out to the unusual island every spring and net a glorious feast of eggs, birds, and fish. Often referred to as a “fortress,” the dead volcano island is a stellar example of the stark beauty consistently offered up by the Icelandic landscape.",vikings mythology volcanoes birds islands geology animals
72,Námafjall,Iceland,In Northeastern Iceland lies something of an oxymoron: a steaming desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/namafjall,"Normally, desert landscapes are characterized by a distinct lack of activity. Other than the occasional stray tumbleweed, tourists shouldn’t expect to see much more than a few stoic cacti basking in the sun. But in Northeastern Iceland is a site that defies all norms: a steaming, bubbling desert. Námafjall is a geothermal area located east of Lake Myvatn, looking like a mixture of an alien landscape and the Hell from Dante’s Inferno. Located at the base of a towering volcanic mountain, this site features a large collection of boiling mud pots and steam springs called fumaroles, which are openings in the ground that emit sulfurous gases. During the drive toward the site, the surrounding area could almost be mistaken for an Arizonan desert, but as visitors draw closer to Námafjall, any sense of familiarity drops away. At this site, the desert splits open and steams like a boiling kettle— but it’s not water that the fumaroles and mud pots are spewing into the atmosphere. In order for visitors to enjoy the unique landscape at Námafjall, they must be willing to endure the stench of the noxious fumes emitted from the cracks in the ground, which smell distinctly like rotten eggs. These fumes have driven away any plant life from the area (as they do tourists with sensitive noses), leaving the site as barren of vegetation as Mars. But if visitors can manage to suffer through the stench, they can wander through a landscape unlike any other. In addition to the fumaroles and mud pots, bright arrays of colored mineral deposits adorn the ground around the area. So, even though the site is devoid of plants, the dirt appears to be teeming with a vibrancy that even the showiest lichens and mosses would be hard pressed to match.  Also called Hverir, the geothermal area is located just east of Lake Myvatn and Reykjahlíð village. The site is off of Route 1 aka Ring Road.

Friðheimar is a family-run business mainly centered around tomatoes (though the family grows cucumbers and breeds horses as well). A borehole right on the property provides the warmth for the greenhouse, thanks to warm water and steam created by geothermal energy on the volcanic, tectonically active island. While bananas, roses, cucumbers, and more grow in greenhouses across the country, Friðheimar is especially special because it caters to visitors. It’s possible to dine right inside the greenhouse, where you can pick from the restaurant’s tomato-centric menu to indulge in treats like tomato soup, Bloody Mary’s, tomato ice cream, and tomato beer. You can also tour the farm and see a daily Icelandic horse show, which includes an occasional exhibition of the beer tölt, a fun, quirky equestrian game. Riders saddle up their trusty Icelandic horses and set off, mug of beer in hand. They then put their mounts through their paces while trying not to slosh their brew all over the place. The rider who spills the least wins. The whole point of the game is to both test the riders’ skills and show off the steadiness of the tölt, the breed’s unique gait.

Accompanied by guides Pall Jonsson and Thorlakur Thorlaksson, Frederick W. W. Howell was the first to scale the mighty crater back in 1891, but he was certainly not the last. Hvannadalshnjúkur is a popular climb that is actually fairly novice from a technical standpoint, but with sea level glaciers, a fair number of ice crevasses present the most challenging aspect. The climb can easily be underestimated due to weather and the numerous chasms, and it’s highly suggested that the less experienced glacier climbers bring a guide.Hvannadalshnjúkur is a part of a crater belonging to Oræfajökull, a post-glacial volcano that in the world of volcanos rates as a giant, coming in second only to Mount Etna in Italy as the largest in Europe. While that title is impressive, some perspective is given when considering that Oræfajökull is but a small section of a much more imposing heavyweight, the gargantuan Vatnajökull, the largest glacier in Iceland, as well as the biggest glacial ice cap in all of Europe. Oræfajökull (which translates roughly into glacier wasteland) has only erupted twice since man started recording such things, the last time being in 1727. While it doesn’t blow often, when it does, it strives for greatness—the 1727 eruption still holds the distinction of being the greatest tephra fall (volcanic ash spread) in the history of Iceland, a land rife with volcanic activity. Hvannadalshnjúkur has two main routes for climbers, both climbs possible to finish in a day.

Over time as more and more people began their trips, the amount of cairns grew to form the sweeping display that stands today. There are other cairns throughout Iceland as well. For centuries, locals used these stacks of stones as navigational markers. Early settlers built them to mark their trails or other important sites, and the tradition grew as the years went on. Now, however, people are asked not to add any more cairns to the countryside. As Iceland is inundated with tourists, any new rock piles risk damaging the environment and the already-existing pieces of cultural heritage. It's just off the Ring Road about 30 minutes east of Vik.",luck superstitions rock formations rocks roadside attractions geology
77,Fischer,"Reykjavik, Iceland",This aromatherapy shop and mini-museum cofounded by the Sigur Rós frontman documents Icelandic history through scents.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fischer,"Tucked away on Fischershund, a quiet street in downtown Reykjavik, is a shop selling perfumes, beauty products, candles, and home goods infused with Icelandic essential oils. Head down a set of stairs near the register, and you’ll find a small cellar housing a mini-museum documenting Icelandic history through odor. The walls are lined with moments from the past—photos and stories of rebellion, raging fires, and more—below which sit glass jars, each coated with an aroma that captures and recreates the moment. Lift each jar and breathe in deeply to get a whiff of smoky pine, florals, sweet sugar, and other scents exclusive to the Nordic country and its chronicles. The cozy aromatherapy shop is located in the former music studio of Jónsi, the frontman of prolific Icelandic band Sigur Rós. Jónsi founded the store alongside his sisters and extended family.  The family behind Fischer is deeply involved in the arts. Don't forget to climb the ladder in the back left corner of the shop and glance through a small window to see hidden video art by sister Sigurrós (the namesake of her brother's band).",perfume smells stores shops museums

79,Sigurgeirs Bird Museum,"Husavik, Iceland","Largest private bird collection in Iceland, formed from a tragic accident.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sigurgeirs-bird-museum,"Lake Myvatn in the north of Iceland has the feel of a magical place. Created by a volcanic eruption 2300 years ago, the area surrounding the lake is a dramatic landscape dominated by lava pillars, boiling mud pools, steaming fumaroles, and sulphur pits. The lake and surroundings wetlands are rich in plant life, and the lake is one of the world’s richest in aquatic birds - some 115 species have been spotted in the area. With 30 duck species alone, nowhere in the world have so many species of ducks been found in one location. It was here that Sigurgeir Stefansson was born, lived his life, and where at 37, he died. Raised on the Ytri-Neslönd farm, Stefansson spent his youth collecting birds eggs, creating his own miniature natural history museum. It wasn’t long before he had collected the eggs of every native Icelandic bird. When he was 14, Stefansson was given a taxidermied bird and soon after began seeking out dead birds and paying to have them meet a similar fate. Soon, his friends and neighbors were calling him anytime they found a bird carcass, and Stefansson spent almost all of his spare money getting specimens stuffed and posed. Eventually, the collection became so large that it had filled his family’s home and it was moved into a nearby shack once used to house seismographic tools. An enormous bird lover, Sigurgeir Stefansson was in contact and traded with ornithologists around the world. Often approached by visiting researchers, he is said to have been able to identify birds by only the flutter of their wings. In 1999 Stefansson and two companions were killed when, while helping to repair an underwater telephone cable, a storm struck and capsized his boat. He and two telephone company workers drowned in lake Myvatn. Stefansson never married or had children, but he left behind his most precious possession - his immaculate collection of taxidermied birds - something which is family felt should be preserved in his honor. When he was alive he had said his dream was to build the collection a proper museum and lamented, “Everybody wants a building, but no one wants to pay for it.” With help from his family and the Aurora Charity Fund, the Sigurgeirs Bird Museum opened on August 17, 2008, and it holds Stefansson’s unique collection of 330 stuffed birds, among them 180 species, including almost all the stray birds that come to Iceland, all the indigenous Icelandic birds except the red phalarope, as well as a few rare specimens from abroad. The museum also has an aviary and a guest house where visitors can stay the night. The guest house provides food like “rye bread that’s been cooked in a hot spring with smoked trout, flat bread with home-smoked lamb and fresh waffles.” No doubt Sigurgeir Stefansson would have been proud.",taxidermy natural history birds animals
80,The Long Room Library at Trinity College,"Dublin, Ireland",The gorgeous library at Trinity College is home to remarkable treasures of Irish identity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-long-room-library-dublin-ireland,"Built between 1712 and 1732, the Long Room at Trinity College’s Old Library holds the collection’s 200,000 oldest books. The distinctive and beautiful barrel ceiling was added in 1860 to allow space for more works when the existing shelves became full. Marble busts of famous philosophers and writers line the central walkway of the nearly 200-foot-long room, created by sculptor Peter Schemakers beginning in 1743. The enormous collection housed in the long room includes a rare copy of the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic and the 15th-century wooden harp in the library which is the model for the emblem of Ireland. By far its most famous holding, however, is an extraordinary illuminated manuscript known as the Book of Kells. Decorated with lavish Celtic and Christian iconography, its distinctive designs have become firmly rooted in Irish identity. Thought to have been created around 800 AD by Christian monks on the Isle of Iona in Scotland, it is composed of the four gospels, hand-transcribed on vellum in a script style known as “insular majuscule” or “insular script” which flourished in Ireland and Scotland between 600 and 850. It is named for the monastery at Kells, County Meath where the monks took refuge after a Viking raid and which became the manuscript’s home for centuries. The Book of Kells came to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661, for safekeeping after the Cromwellian raids on religious institutions. It has been on display since the 19th century.",repositories of knowledge libraries
81,St. Michan's Mummies,"Dublin, Ireland",An Irish church where an 800-year-old mummy is reaching out of his coffin as if to shake hands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-michans-church,"Down a set of dimly lit narrow stone steps, in a vault underneath the church, lay dozens of coffins, and one mummy ready to shake your hand. The mummies in the basement of St. Michan’s church in Dublin, Ireland, are really only available for viewing because of a loophole in the rules of the church. St. Michan Church has an interesting history even without the mummies. The foundation of the church was built in 1095 to serve the ostracized Vikings, who were still in Ireland after the rest had been killed or kicked out by Wolf the Quarrelsome and other Irish forces in 1014. The church was rebuilt in 1686, and a large pipe organ was installed in 1724, on which Handel is said to have first played the Messiah. But all along, as the church changed, the crypt stayed the same: slowly mummifying all that lay within it. There are a number of theories as to why the corpses in the basement have been preserved over time. One is that the basement contains limestone, making the basement particularly dry and therefore good for mummification. Another is that the church was built on former swamp land, and that methane gas is acting as a kind of preservative of the bodies. Other theories involve the presence of oak wood in the soil, or the building materials used in the church. Regardless of the reason, whatever is preserving the mummies is also disintegrating their coffins. After a certain amount of time, the wood falls away and a well-preserved mummy comes tumbling out. This is where the loophole comes in, for though it would be inappropriate for the Church to break open caskets looking for mummies, when the mummies reveal themselves, so be it. The mummies have indeed revealed themselves. While there are caskets strewn about and in small nooks in the wall—some coffins are falling apart enough to reveal an arm or leg—the most visible mummies are “the big four,” four mummified corpses which have no lids on their coffins and are displayed together. On the right is, a woman, simply called “the unknown,” and well, there isn’t much more to say about her. The middle one is known as “the thief” and is missing parts of both feet and a hand, some say the hand was cut off as punishment. It is believed the “thief” later converted and became a priest or respected man, which is why he is buried in the church. (Or possibly, he was never a thief at all and lost the hand in some other way…) Next to him on the left lies a small woman, thought to have been, and known as, “the nun.” But the true star here is the coffin set apart from the others and belonging to an 800-year-old mummy called “the crusader.” Though it may be apocryphal, it is believed that he was a soldier who either died in the crusades or returned and died shortly thereafter. (This assumes that these were the fourth crusades, the only ones that match with a date of 800 years old. Curiously, the fourth crusades turned into a kind of piratical free for all, ending in the sacking of Constantinople, without the permission of the church. The Crusader was quite tall for the time, six and a half feet tall, a giant back then, and his legs have been broken and folded up under him to fit him into his small coffin. His hand stretches out of the casket slightly and visitors were once encouraged to give it a shake. The crypt also holds the coffins of the Sheare brothers who were executed by the British—and as was discovered recently drawn and quartered as well—for the Rising of 1798, as well as mathematician William Rowan Hamilton, the many Earls of Kenmare, and supposedly, though others claim him too, the remains of Robert Emmet, the Irish rebel killed by the British in 1803. The crypt is said to have been visited by a young Bram Stoker, inspiring a certain morbid streak that would later serve quite well for the author. Update July 2019: In February 2019, the crypt was broken into and desecrated. The head of the 800-year-old Crusader was stolen, the nun’s body was decapitated, and another body was turned over. An Garda Síochána detained and questioned a man in relation to the desecration and theft. The head and other bones were recovered and sent to the National Museum of Ireland for safekeeping as they had sustained water damage during the commission of the crime. After undergoing special conservation at the National Museum Ireland, the skull has been returned and St. Michan’s will be open for tours again.  As of July 2017, you can no longer touch any of the mummies.",mummies memento mori catacombs and crypts sacred spaces
82,Skellig Michael,"Kerry, Ireland",Perfectly preserved ancient monastery in an impossibly dramatic location on a rocky island in the Atlantic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skellig-michael,"“An incredible, impossible, mad place. I tell you the thing does not belong to any world that you and I have lived and worked in; it is part of our dream world.” – George Bernard Shaw Skellig Michael is a remote, precipitous, rocky island situated eight miles from the coast of County Kerry, Ireland. It is the larger of two jagged islands that jut out from the swell of the Atlantic Ocean and thrust 230 meters straight up. Legends tell of the importance of the islands in prehistoric, pagan times, but the known history of Skellig Michael begins when a monastery was founded near the summit in the middle of the 7th century. Consisting of distinctive ‘beehive’ stone huts clustered around an oratory and a tiny vegetable garden, this was truly a place of solitude for the few monks who lived here, only accessible by climbing 600 stone steps up the cliff. Perched on the higher, southern peak of the island is another oratory, intended for a single monk seeking true isolation amongst the cathedral-like rocky spires. The monastic peace was shattered in the 9th century when a number of Viking raids threatened the very existence of this tiny community. But despite this, the monastery survived up until the 12th century when the monks abandoned the island and moved to the mainland. The monastery itself is remarkably well preserved, with daily boatloads of visitors from the mainland making the precarious leap to the small harbor at the bottom of the cliff. The extreme inaccessibility and remote location of these buildings have meant that just a trickle of tourists have visited the site, thus minimizing the erosion of the paved steps and terraces. The smaller of the two islands, Little Skellig, is no less dramatic. Situated a little closer to the shore, the island is Ireland’s largest Gannet colony, with over 20,000 breeding pairs. Skellig Michael is also home to a variety of species such as puffins, gannets, razorbills, and grey seals. The island, once relatively little known, was thrust into fame when the precarious steps, cliffs and beehive houses at the top were used as the setting for Luke Skywalker’s isolated hideaway at the end of Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens and, again in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The island can expect a steady stream of Jedi carrying lightsabers up the winding path.  Landing trips to the island operate between mid-May and early October, weather permitting. Fifteen boats are licensed to carry 12 passengers each so numbers are extremely limited. Contact details are published by the Office of Public Works. It's a mildly challenging walk up the 618 steps to the monastery at the top of the island so be prepared with grippy shoes, layered clothing, waterproofs for the boat, water, and food. Also, there are no toilets on the island. There are also eco-tours that take visitors on a water-based adventure without leaving the boat, getting up close to Skellig Michael to observe local wildlife. Star Wars has now massively increased interest in the island so it's advised to book months in advance. Or, failing that, make contact with a local accommodation provider who may have connections with one of the boatmen.",islands natural wonders nature sacred spaces ruins architectural oddities architecture
83,Dunmore Cave,"Kilkenny, Ireland","This Irish show cave is said to have been the site of a Viking massacre that claimed 1,000 lives.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dunmore-cave,"For centuries the relatively small Dunmore Cave has been fascinating writers, archeologists and explorers, and while it’s open to visitors today as a lovely bit of geology, it is possibly most famed as the site of a Viking massacre. The limestone cave, located in County Kilkenny, has been known to modern archeologists since the mid-1800s when the first serious expedition into the depths of the cave was undertaken, however the site was known for centuries prior. The first mention of the cavern is in a 9th century Irish triad poem where it is mentioned as one of the “darkest places in Ireland.” The next mention of the cave is the most sensational, however, where the cave gets named in a 17th century manuscript as the site of a Viking battle that took place in 928 CE that racked up 1,000 casualties. While pieces of gold and silver have famously been found in the depths of the cave, researchers have also found a number of human remains that give some credence to the tale of a massacre (although certainly not enough to prove 1,000 people were killed there). Since the 1960s the cave has been open as a show cave for visitors to explore. A small amount of safety infrastructure was installed including a roof over the cave mouth to prevent debris from raining down as people enter. However there has been no talk of what’s being done about the souls of the restless nords lingering in the air.",vikings caves ecosystems geology
84,Irish Sky Garden,"Skibbereen, Ireland","This floating garden in the sky is straight out of a fairy tale, but the real thing is nothing short of magical.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/irish-sky-garden,"The Irish Sky Garden’s name describes what to expect fairly well, but seeing this patch of nature suspended in the air, juxtaposed against the clear blue sky, is far more whimsical and mesmerizing than visitors expect. Designed by American James Turrell, this magical knoll is the perfect symbol for the Emerald Isle, and it’s an unparalleled piece of public art. Turrell is famed for his large-scale experimentations with light and space, challenging the viewer to engage with the boundaries and wonder of human perception. The Sky Garden is set against the natural landscape of the Celtic Liss Ard, or “High Fort,” an ancient structure half reclaimed by nature which lends its own fairytale whimsy to the location. So even though the sky garden is a contemporary piece of art with a strikingly postmodern shape and aesthetic, it is the perfect complement to a place that is already a bridge between two worlds. Shaped like a bowl, the structure features a central stone plinth reminiscent of ancient Celtic and Egyptian altars. The altar rises up at an angle, and features two stone footrests on each end to allow the viewer to lie down facing up and out toward the edge of the crater above. All that is visible from this vantage point is the green grass and sky, creating a uniquely serene experience that invokes past rituals and ancient rites. According to Turrell, “the most important thing is that inside turns into outside and the other way around, in the sense that relationships between the Irish landscape and sky changes.” If you have ever struggled to empty your mind during meditation, a moment alone in the Sky Garden may be the closest you’ll come to achieving optical and aural harmony.",botanical gardens flora outsider art plants
85,The Glen,"Sligo, Ireland",A tiny microvalley etched into the side of Knocknarea Mountain hides another world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ireland-glen-knocknerea,"There are arboretums, and then there are herb gardens. There are mountains, and then there are hills. And in Ireland, there are glens, and then there is The Glen. If a glen is a small valley, then The Glen is something else. One might coin the term “microvalley” just to describe this place. Walking through the rusty iron gate that leads you out of the wind and into the tranquility of The Glen, with its lush and dewy silence – every experience you’ve ever described as being “as if in a fairy tale” will be replaced by this. Nestled between sheer rock walls reaching heights of 60 feet, rare visitors to this enchanted glen are overwhelmed by vibrant hues of slate and green, surrounded by hanging vines and ivy-covered stone, ancient trees and mossy rock. And how fitting that this secret gully be etched into the side of Knocknarea Mountain – a place with fairy tales all its own. Knocknarea is a popular hiking destination filled with Irish lore. It’s topped with a massive pile of stones known as Queen Maeve’s Tomb – supposedly the final resting place of the mythical Queen Maeve. Hikers frequently visit the site to pay homage and take in the countryside. Yet even with that, The Glen is largely unknown and little-visited. The Glen is a geological oddity lacking a commonplace explanation, but it seems likely that the deep crevasse was carved out by a particularly ill-tempered glacier eons ago. Visitors will have to know where to look along the road to Knocknarea Mountain, where just past an old well and nearly eclipsed by overgrown flora, a simple but intriguing gate marks the entrance to another world – Queen Maeve’s own secret garden.  Travel along Glen Road on the southern slope of Knocknarea Mountain, past the turn-off for the Queen Maeve's Grave parking lot. About a half-mile down, on the right-hand side of the road, you'll see an old well (easily missed) surrounded by a low, circular white/gray wall. Roughly opposite the well is an overgrown and barely visible steel gate. That is the entrance. Wellies or muck-proof shoes are recommended as the path into and through the valley can be extremely muddy.

90,Kilmainham Gaol,"Dublin, Ireland","One of Ireland's most infamous prisons for rebels including men, women and children.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kilmainham-gaol,"One of Ireland’s most infamous prisons was built in 1787 directly on the gallows - where public hangings had already taken place for years. These executions continued throughout its existence both inside the gates and out, including those that were the catalyst for Ireland’s emergence as an independent nation. Kilmainham Gaol was a working and silent prison that housed men, women, and children, and was in operation from 1787 until 1924. The youngest child imprisoned at Kilmainham was believed to have been just seven years old. In the years of the harshest famines, people would intentionally break the law to enter the Gaol, in the hopes that they would be fed while incarcerated, which led to severe overcrowding. Women and children were forced to sleep on the floor in the corridors with no blankets while men were squeezed into cells that held up to five people at a time. Kilmainham Gaol became notorious for its rebel prisoners. Irish Nationalists were sent in great numbers to the prison and almost every Irish Republican leader had been housed within its walls at one time or another, during its years of operation. Many were executed there as well. Many of the prisoners left haunting graffiti on the walls affirming their willingness to die as martyrs for their beliefs. A particularly powerful and prophetic verse by the Nationalist leader Padraig Pearse is scrawled on one of the cell walls: “Beware the Risen People / That have harried and held/ Ye that have bullied and bribed.” In 1916, during an event called the Easter Rising, Irish republican rebels took over the General Post Office and other locations in the heart of Dublin to protest being ruled by the British. They held their positions for six days before surrendering. When they did surrender, the leaders were sent to Kilmainham Gaol. Once there, they were tried in secret, found guilty, and executed by firing squad in the yard. All seven signatories on the Proclamation of Independence were shot at Kilmainham, including one who had just been married in the prison chapel and another who had to be tied to a chair due to his injuries. But the executions, intended to quell the nationalist uprising, had the opposite effect. A movement that had before been the interest of only a few gained momentum and strength as word spread about these martyr-like executions, eventually leading to independence for the majority of Ireland just a few years later. The prison closed its doors in 1924. Today Kilmainham has been restored and reopened to the public. It offers guided tours and houses a tea shop and a museum that spans three floors. Attractions include a major exhibition detailing the political and penal history of the prison and its restoration. Another large exhibition is on the history of Irish Nationalism and features some of the last words of the executed leaders of the 1916 rebellion. The tour of the prison includes a brief overview of both Irish history and the history of the Gaol itself. Access to the prison is limited and is allowed on guided tours only.  Public transport available - there's a bus stop located right outside the gaol or the Luas Red line tram drops off a short distance away.",prisons crime and punishment politics museums and collections museums
91,Saint Audoen's Gate,"Dublin, Ireland",The enchanting archway is the only surviving portal into Dublin's lost medieval wall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-audoens-gate,"A great stone wall once hugged the edges of medieval Dublin, enveloping the city’s residents within its embrace. Tall and formidable, access to the city was only granted through the handful of arched gates that peppered the barrier. The wall and its gates were built in 1240 by Norman settlers. For centuries, the fortifications defended Dublin against invading clans and foreign people. In addition to being portals into the city, the gateways also served as tollbooths. As the years wore on, Dublin’s need to maintain its stoic perimeter decreased. Abandoned bits and pieces crumbled. Entire sections fell into disrepair. Eventually, parts of the wall were torn down and lost to time. Only one of the city’s historic gates exists to this day. Tucked behind a side of a church within a small stretch of surviving wall, Saint Audoen’s Gate (also sometimes called Saint Audoen’s Arch) leads to a narrow alleyway. It was restored in 1976, and today visitors can exit the historic center of the city through the gate and follow the winding medieval pathway to High Street and Cornmarket, where they can discover other extant portions of the lost city wall.

92,Kingship and Sacrifice,"Dublin, Ireland",This permanent collection of preserved bodies taken from Irish bogs is one of the leading authorities on such morbid mummies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kingship-and-sacrifice,"Located within the National Museum of Ireland, the permanent exhibition known as Kingship and Sacrifice is a grim collection of withered human sacrifices who were preserved by the natural peat in which they were buried, including the Cashel Man, the oldest bog body ever found that still had flesh on its bones. Starting in 2003, a research project known as the Bog Bodies Research Project was started at the museum, which brought a number of local corpses to the center that had been preserved for thousands of years. Ritual human sacrifice in ancient Ireland was not an uncommon practice, but the disposal of the victims often led to the remarkable preservation of their remains thanks to the unique earthen properties of peat. The bodies, despite being thousands of years old, still have blackened flesh clinging to their bones. The identity of the sacrificial victims remains unknown, but various hypotheses exist, including that they were deposed kings or shamans, simple commoners offered to appease the gods and guarantee harvests, and even “outsiders” such as adulterers and thieves who had broken taboos. In addition to the remarkable bodies dredged up from the muck, regalia and jewelry were found near the bodies, indicating the possibly exalted positions the sacrifices likely held, hence the name of the exhibition. Mummified bog bodies can be found all across the globe, but the blacked bodices on display are some of the only ones that are on actual public display.

93,The Hungry Tree,"Dublin, Ireland",An 80-year-old plane tree is devouring an iron bench at Ireland's oldest law school.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-hungry-tree-dublin-ireland,"Most trees feast upon a steady diet of carbon dioxide, water, and sunshine, which they absorb through their roots and leaves. Some, though, like to absorb other things as well. The Hungry Tree in Dublin is an 80-year-old London Plane tree that’s currently in the process of devouring a cast iron bench. As the years have passed, the tree has grown, causing it to swallow the parts of the structure that stands in its way. Its gnarled bark now spills over the back of the bench, making it appear as though the seat is being sucked into the tree’s trunk. It isn’t the first tree to eat something that stood in its way. Other trees around the world have acted similarly when faced with an obstacle that intrudes upon their growth. Still that hasn’t stopped the Hungry Tree from being listed by the Tree Council of Ireland as one of Ireland’s Heritage Trees. The arboreal bench-eater is located within the grounds of The Honorable Society of King’s Inns, Ireland’s oldest school of law, established in 1541 during the reign of King Henry VIII. The grounds are open and accessible to the public and lead on to Henrietta Street, which along with King’s Inns itself has been used as a location for many films and TV dramas.

94,Drombeg Stone Circle,"Rosscarbery, Ireland",One of the most popular megalithic sites in Ireland stands as a humbler version of Stonehenge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drombeg-stone-circle-2,"It sometimes seems as though every stray rock in the Irish countryside has some archeological significance, but formations such as the popular Drombeg Stone Circle show that the people of megalithic Ireland were building elaborate stoneworks. Also known as the “Druid’s Altar,” the circle is a megalithic formation that once consisted of 17 stones (only 13 remain) out in the countryside of Cork County, Ireland. Radiocarbon dating of human remains found at the site during a 1957 excavation suggests that the area was built and actively used between 1100-800 BC. Now the site is secluded, tucked away between verdant farmland and network of country roads. Approaching the stone circle requires walking a short way along a gravel path among high bushes that seem to hide the circle. But then the flat expanse of land opens and the stones rise from the landscape. Visitors expecting Stonehenge should think again. The Drombeg stones are mostly less than two meters high, and the stone circle is oriented along the southwest axis to line up with the midwinter solstice. Scattered across the nearby plain are several other relics including dwelling remains and the site of a primitive kitchen.  There are also the remains of a sacred well by the pathway. Given that this is one of the most visited sites of its kind in Ireland, parts of the land have been covered by gravel to preserve the area, but those interested can walk among the rocks and even touch the sacred stones that humans have revered for thousands of years.  The Drombeg Stone Circle is a little over an hour from Cork, Ireland by car. No public transit access exists. Leaving Cork, take N71 southwest through Bandon and Clonakilty (approximately 55km).

95,The Lost Town of Newtown Jerpoint (Jerpoint Park),Ireland,Local legend says the remains of Father Christmas lie within the medieval grounds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lost-town-of-newtown-jerpoint-kilkenny-ireland,"What’s left of the abandoned medieval village of Newtown Jerpoint lies just outside the Irish town of Thomastown, in Kilkenny. The ruins of Saint Nicholas’ Church, which dates to sometime between the 12th and 13th centuries, still stand. Local legend has it that Saint Nicholas—a.k.a Father Christmas, the inspiration behind Santa Claus—is buried within a cracked, carved tomb in its grounds. According to local tradition, two Norman crusaders nabbed the saint’s remains while heading home to Kilkenny from the Holy Land over 800 years ago. Saint Nicholas’ supposed tombstone depicts a cleric with the heads of two knights peering over his shoulder, which represent the knights who carried the bones. Though it’s true that Norman knights from the area were part of the crusades, the theory that they stole and relocated Father Christmas isn’t widely accepted by non-locals. Newtown Jerpoint existed until sometime in the 17th century. Though it was once a bustling village with over a dozen taverns, the loss of its toll bridge and the re-routing of the local road eventually caused its residents to abandon it. Now, the ruined church and tomb exist within the privately owned Jerpoint Park, a working farm that offers tours, fishing, and sheep dog demonstrations.  Jerpoint is just 2.0 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Thomastown, and 15–20 minutes from the city center of Kilkenny.",villages saints christianity tombs graveyards legends medieval religion cemeteries churches sacred spaces ruins history
96,Sean's Bar,"Athlone, Ireland",The oldest pub in Ireland may also be the oldest surviving bar in the entire world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sean-s-bar,"Sitting in a traditional Irish neighborhood on the bank of the River Shannon, Sean’s Bar is a quintessential Irish public house, which makes sense as it predates all of them, and maybe even every bar still in existence. It was during renovations in the 1970’s that workers found evidence that the already historic pub may have dated back far further than anyone had previously thought. It was discovered that one of the walls was actually made of wattle and daub, an ancient building compound that used wooden strips held together by mud and clay. They also found some ancient coins that dated back to around 900 CE which was confirmed when the ancient wall was carbon tested. Looking into history, it seems that the bar had likely existed for over a thousand years after being established as an inn for travelers crossing the fords that once sat in the area. The coins and most of the wall were moved to the Irish National Museum, but a portion of the ancient construction still remains on site. The bar has been awarded the Guinness World Record for oldest pub in Ireland, and investigations are ongoing to secure the honor of oldest bar in the world. Whether or not this is true, the pub continues to operate as a traditional (the MOST traditional?) Irish pub with ale and music that seems like it might keep ringing out for another thousand years.",world's oldest bars archaeology
97,Dun Aonghasa,"Galway, Ireland","An Iron Age fort on the edge of a seaside cliff offers a glimpse into an ancient, mystical world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dun-aonghasa,"Inishmore’s stunning karst landscape is made all the more ethereal thanks to the ruins of an Iron Age fort perched on a seaside cliff. Known as Dún Aonghasa, archaeologists have long studied the sprawling fort’s remnants, located 100 meters above the crashing waves of the North Atlantic, and for just as long they have come up with little distinct evidence pointing to when, precisely, the structure was created. All sorts of magnificent stories have been handed down over the years of explorers, researchers, or artists’ first reactions to Dún Aonghasa. Perhaps the most charming of all is that of noted antiquarian John O’Donovan who, upon reaching the magical fort in 1839, was so overcome with emotion that he, “shouted with delight, and after launching his umbrella a marvelous height into the air, threw himself on the ground, and shouted again and again.” Over the years, teams of specialists have surmised that the fort’s first, most basic iteration likely appeared around 1100 BCE when the earliest settlers amassed large amounts of debris against the site’s large boulders. Over the course of centuries, the fort slowly grew into today’s recognizable D-shape formation, featuring concentric walls of defenses stretching as far as the eye can see, as well as a field of upright rocks planted as a systematic deterrent (known as a “cheval de frise”). Working together, teams of specialists have restored the fort in several spots to what is thought to closely resemble its original appearance, including a six-meter-tall battlement. The restored areas are easily discernible from the rest of the archeological site due to their mortared construction. Just around the proverbial corner from Dún Aonghasa is an unrelated Neolithic tomb, along with a thatched cottage and a reconstructed poteen distillery depicting the ancient cultural heritage of the area’s first inhabitants, whose traces can be still be found in modern-day Ireland. Everything – both new and old – is open to exploration. Equally of benefit to curious minds and the site as it is a detriment to daydreamers is the fact that very few safety precautions have been added to Dún Aonghasa, meaning visitors can walk or fall right off the aforementioned cliff, if lost in thought, or simply clumsy. There are regular ferries to Inishmore (Inis Mór) from Rossaveal near Galway (takes about 40 minutes), and from Doolin (~40 minutes). From the harbor on Inishmore, you can either take a taxi, walk or rent a bike. There is a small museum at the bottom of Dun Aonghasa where you will have to get your tickets. The hike up to the actual ruins will take you about 10 minutes but isn't very strenuous. As the weather on Inishmore is quite unstable, it is advised to bring a raincoat or a poncho along. Waterproof shoes might be a good addition as well. There is is a little café right next to the museum, so you don't really need to bring drinks or snacks. Be aware that there is no railing around Dún Aonghasa, so if you suffer from vertigo you really should stay well off the edge (a sheer cliff of around 300 ft).",prehistoric forts ruins

Containing a collection of over 2 millions specimens, the museum holds minerals and other geologic items, as well as taxidermy and the skeletons of animals of Ireland and the world, both current and extinct. The real draw, however, is the way the museum layout and displays have gone seemingly unchanged since Victorian times. Filled with wood framed glass cases harboring stuffed African game, and situated underneath gigantic whale and shark skeletons suspended from the ceilings, the museum showcases its collection now in the same way it did at the turn of the last century. Many of the stuffed and mounted or pickled animal specimens are over a century old and some still bear the evidence of the early days of taxidermy and occasionally, even bullet holes. Among the most notable specimens are a polar bear in which the bullet holes are especially notable, a composite dodo bird skeleton, from the Island nation of Mauritius. Among the most notable items in the collection are the Blaschka glass animals. Made in Dresden, Germany in the 1870’s by father and son glassmakers Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, the glass is an excellent way of demonstrating to visitors what hard to preserve animals like anemones and jellyfish look like, and one of only a few collections – the largest collection of their glass flowers is found at the Harvard natural history museum – of their exquisite and astonishingly realistic work found n the world.

It is a local fixture, visible right from across the river from the National University of Ireland, Galway. Yet this mysterious abandoned castle is so thoroughly overgrown with vegetation it is almost disappearing into the scenery. The 16th-century castle was the home of the Blake family, English nobles that inhabited the Menlo estate (also called Blake Castle) from 1569 up until a fire destroyed the castle in 1910, tragically taking the life of the Blake’s disabled daughter, Eleanor, whose body was never found. The riverside path alongside the empty castle is a quiet and unassuming spot, populated by just a few local dog walkers or joggers from the university. The green vegetation that blankets the castle makes it difficult to spot, as it blends in with its natural surroundings. But continue along and you’ll come upon the ruins of a small stone hut, which help to reveal that the castle will soon come into view. When you get close enough, the large round towers distinguish the castle from the surrounding trees, and once you get a direct line of sight, the exposed stone toward the base reveals the extent of the structure. Green hanging vines cover nearly the entire stone exterior, indicating just how long the castle has been deserted and reclaimed by the natural landscape. Update February 2022: The ivy on the castle has unfortunately been cut down, and a construction site fence has been erected around the castle, blocking access to the ruins.  The castle is around an hour walk or a short drive from the center of town. Walk to the end of the dirt road and hop over the locked gate at the end.

Established in 1180, Jerpoint Abbey was built for the Cistercian sect of Catholic monks by the King of Osraige on the site of an earlier Benedictine monastery. The remaining ruins date from different time periods, but all of them are impressive in their ability to last; the tower dates from the 15th century, the church from the 12th, and the transept chapels vary in age. After the Dissolution of Monasteries when the last abbot, Oliver Grace, surrendered the abbey during the reign of King Henry VIII, Jerpoint was given to the 9th Earl of Ormond and became primarily a place of interment. Among the notable carvings in the ruins are the saintly religious reliefs known as “the weepers,” and a sarcophagus that is surrounded by medieval Christian reliefs. Many of the pillars and incidental spaces in the ruined abbey are covered in similar figure carvings. The expansive cloister arcade also remains and visitors can relax among the tranquil ruins. Despite some deterioration over the centuries, the Jerpoint Abbey ruins offer as contemplative an experience to modern visitors as the abbey did to the original clergy.  2.5km south west from Thomastown on the N9.

101,Kyteler's Inn,"Kilkenny, Ireland",The oldest inn in Kilkenny was established by the first convicted witch in Ireland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyteler-s-inn,"Dame Alice Kyteler was a very powerful woman in 14th century Ireland, but with that power came both devotion and bitter jealousy, the latter leading to the first witch trial in all of Ireland. Born into a wealthy Norman family, Dame Alice continued to amass her fortunes with each of her four marriages. One of her many business ventures was a sprawling stone inn, which was opened sometime around 1323, making it one of the oldest in the entire country. When her last husband fell ill and died, his family feared destitution and began spreading rumors that Dame Alice had used sorcery and poison against him. She was the first woman to be accused of being with an incubus (a demon lover) and was additionally accused of using potions and charms to bewitch and murder, among other ridiculously far-fetched claims. The case was brought to the Bishop of Ossory in 1324, but before he could convict her, the Dame’s wealthy and loyal friends imprisoned him for 16 days in a misguided attempt to dissuade him from persecuting her. His imprisonment only made him more vengeful and she was convicted and sentenced to execution, making her the first witch in Ireland.  Many of her servants and supporters were convicted with her. This was good news for her stepchildren and her enemies, but the night before her execution she was spirited away by those who remained loyal to her. Unfortunately, they could only save her alone, and her longtime faithful servant Petronella spent the next few days being publicly tortured by a very angry bishop. It was the first recorded case of torture used as coercion in a witch trial and he succeeded in getting her to confess to anything and everything he asked. The raging and sadistic bishop then had her burned at the stake, which was also a first, as no one had been executed by fire before. His brutal methods were an instant hit and were implemented in many future witch trials around the world. It is believed that Dame Alice Kyteler fled to England, though no further records of her exist. All that is certain is that she never returned to Kilkenny. The Inn has continued to operate throughout the centuries, sometimes booming and sometimes falling into dereliction and ruin. It has changed hands multiple times, but in 1986 it was sold again to its present owner, who returned the building to its medieval glory but added modern amenities and resumed serving good food, drink and Irish hospitality to locals and tourists alike. The inn celebrates its founder through its haunted reputation, a witch statue and historical decor featuring Dame Alice’s story.",celtic witchcraft medieval
102,Statue of Oscar Wilde,"Dublin, Ireland","The comedy and tragedy of Oscar Wilde is preserved in a Dublin park, captured in a sculpture of colorful stone.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/statue-of-oscar-wilde,"Merrion Square in central Dublin is not far from Trinity College. One of Dublin’s famous blocks of Georgian homes, Merrion Square was once the stomping grounds of many prominent Irishmen, including the poet W.B. Yeats at No. 82, and straight across, at No. 1, the childhood home of Oscar Wilde. Wilde now lounges just inside the park, on a boulder of white quartz, sculpted from a colorful assemblage of polished granite and semi-precious stones. The sculpture of Wilde was commissioned in 1997 by the Guinness Ireland Group (yes, that Guinness) to commemorate one of Ireland’s most famous sons. A site in Merrion Square Park was chosen, and now the stone Wilde, in relaxed repose, looks straight out at his boyhood home where he grew up the son of the renowned surgeon and Irish folklorist Sir William Wilde. The colors and textures of the statue come as a bit of a surprise, with a jacket carved from deep green nephrite jade, collared in bright pink Norwegian thulite. His trousers are fashioned from sparkling blue pearl granite, with shoes that seem to be spit-shined from polished black granite. His face might seem a bit of a puzzle until you consider the intention of the sculptor, Danny Osborne, whose goal was to capture what he sees as the dual nature of Wilde – at once joyous and somber, both comedy and tragedy – looks that are captured on opposite sides of the face. The life-size statue of Wilde is flanked by two smaller bronzes, both atop polished granite plinths engraved with quotes from Wilde’s work. The first bronze is Osborne’s image of Wilde’s pregnant wife, Constance, and the second is his interpretation of Dionysus, the Greek god of the vine and the theater, by means of a simple male torso. Wilde lived most of his adult life in England, and he died and is buried in Paris – but he is one in a long and storied line of writers whose spirits are deeply rooted in Ireland. Here, in the center of Dublin, he can rest at home. Statue is at the northwest corner of the Park, across the street from #1 Merrion Square",memorials parks statues

Founded in 1030 by the Hiberno-Norse King Sitriuc Silkenbeard and Dúnán, first Bishop of Dublin, the original Viking church has been a part of Dublin and Irish history ever since. The wooden Viking structure was destroyed during the Norman invasion by King Richard (Strongbow) de Clare, and the stone church was built starting in 1171. Strongbow’s tomb is inside the church walls, and his effigy can be seen just beyond the entrance. Famed saint Laurence O’Toole was named Archbishop in the 1150s and although he died in France in 1180, his heart remained in the cathedral until March of 2012, when it disappeared. The preserved heart, which resided inside a heart-shaped box enclosed by iron bars, was stolen by a thief who seemed to have no interest in any of the easily nicked valuables surrounding the relic. In April 2018, the heart was located and returned to the cathedral. A decidedly un-Christian stockade is on display in the crypt (the largest crypt in either Ireland or Britain). Made in 1670, these stocks were used to punish criminals in Christ Church Place. They were moved inside the cathedral in 1870. Another of the cathedral’s more intriguing inhabitants are the mummified remains of a cat and rat. According to church lore, the cat chased the rat into a pipe of an organ and both became stuck. James Joyce used both cat and rat as a simile in Finnegan’s Wake when he described someone as being “…As stuck as that cat to that mouse in that tube of that Christchurch organ…” The cat is chasing the rat in perpetuity behind glass in the crypt of the church.",hearts catholic relics and reliquaries saints sacred spaces

Stepping into the Oratory of the Sacred Heart, which doesn’t look like much from the outside, reveals a stunning mural that stretches across the entire interior of the small red structure. The oratory (a small chapel) was built to be a memorial that celebrated the end of World War I and honored the local Irishmen killed in battle. Bright, vibrant symbols and illustrations fill nearly every inch of the space. It’s full of Celtic knots, spirals, animals, and crosses, all so rich with color they almost appear to glow. The tiny seaside town began using the oratory after receiving a statue of the Sacred Heart from a town in Northern France where many of the local men had fought and died. Sister Concepta Lynch began painting the wall behind the statue after the statue was installed in 1919. People liked her mural so much they encouraged her to expand it. The nun spent 16 years transforming the oratory into the breathtaking masterpiece it is today. Sister Concepta Lynch mainly included themes from early Irish Christian art, but she was also influenced by a variety of sources such as the Book of Kells, a few Islamic designs, and even the Lynch Style of Celtic Art which was originated by her own father. In addition to the statue and mural, the chapel contains stained glass windows that were made by Ireland’s famous Harry Clarke Studio. The building itself even won awards for its modern architecture.  Access is extremely limited and visitors are only permitted during local council heritage seasons in the spring and summer.

The size of the building itself may not be very big but Fiddaun was once considered the largest castle in all of Ireland, due to the amount of land that its outer walls encompassed— close to twelve acres. Sadly, the outer walls have not survived the ages as well as the castle. Fiddaun Castle was built around 1574 and is remarkably preserved—the only things missing from it are the outer walls and the attic, or top story. It is best known for its incredibly intact inner walls, or bawn. They still stand around the tower house with climbable steps and walkable defenses. Though the castle has been empty for hundreds of years, it is also intact and you can explore every floor, corner, and even the rooftop if you can traverse the incredibly narrow and slippery spiral staircase. This makes it an unusual and slightly dangerous treat that you can explore at will. Fiddaun is on private land and maintained by the Department of Public Works. To get there, you must pick up the key from the landowners (who may or may not chaperone or guide you) and hike through acres of fields before the castle even comes into view. It is a hidden gem tucked into the countryside and is not visible from the road. It is well worth the trek however, and it provides a rare glimpse into the castle living of the past. The castle and the walk to it are not easily accessible. A sturdy pair of shoes is a necessity and a bottle of water is recommended.

The Earl was a vigorous and outdoor man so the intricacies of the Manor may never have existed, but for an onset of gout that reduced him to an invalid. His wife, Countess Caroline, was unwilling to watch him become idle and soon convinced him to undertake a vast challenge—to make their Manor wondrous to behold. Their imagination ran wild and every detail of the architecture and decoration tells a story or hides a secret. The most obvious of these is that the Manor contains 365 stained windows and 52 chimneys to mark the days and weeks of the year. Other features of ascending size are intended to represent the seven days of the week and the four seasons. Along the rooftops are carved words that when put altogether are a Bible verse and they are constantly guarded and adorned by carved gargoyles. Inside, the large receiving room features elaborate wood and stone carvings, crystal chandeliers, stained glass and tiled fireplaces. The most repeated motto inside and out is “Quae Sursum Volo Vidare”, which translates to “What is Heavenly I would See”. Perhaps the most amazing fact about this manor is that the Earl and his wife made all their changes without incurring any debt, despite how elaborate and unusual their preferences were. However, when the Manor was transferred to the 3rd Earl of Dunraven, it was still incomplete and he was determined to continue the massive overhaul. He turned to the land and created lush, labyrinthine gardens and landscaped paths throughout the property, putting many people to work even during Ireland’s Great Famine, when other landowners were leaving their workers to starve or immigrate. The Manor was completed in the early 1860s and the Dunraven family’s reputation for sustaining and providing for their workers and people was both rare and appreciated in Ireland. In fact, the 4th Earl was instrumental in the politics that led to land reform and the gradual closing or dismantling of many large estates in Ireland, including the eventual loss of 39,000 acres of his own. In 1982 the 7th Earl of Dunraven put the property up for sale. It was purchased by the Kane family of Florida in the United States who undertook restoring the Manor to its original glory and re-opened the home as a luxurious 5 star hotel. It is an awesome display of architecture, stories, and original stone and wood craftsmanship and the Manor still feels more like a historical home than a modern hotel.

A 19th-century survey stated that Ireland has no fewer than 3,000 holy wells and at least fifteen of them are dedicated to St. Brigid. However, few compare to the one that is located between Liscannor and the Cliffs of Moher in County Clare. This St. Brigid’s well differs from the others in a number of ways. It is one of the oldest wells rumored to have healing powers and the running sound of the water is audible. It is housed in an open stone house or grotto that serves as a gateway to the ancient cemetery on the hill above it, accessible through steep paths and old stairs. The graveyard is the final resting place of several mythical kings and clan leaders of Ireland. Some still celebrate Brigid’s roots by spending the pagan holiday of Lughnasadh in the circular sanctuary of this well. The natural beauty and the mysterious pull of this site make it special in a land known for its roadside shrines and mysticism. In Irish folklore, Brigid and her sisters also named Brigid are a triple Goddess and she is the goddess of higher ground, higher learning, and higher consciousness. She is the patron goddess of the Druids and visible signs of Druid language and pagan worship are still seen in the well. Unable to eradicate Brigid’s popularity with the Celts, Christendom renamed her Mary of the Gaels or Brigit who became known as the foster mother of Jesus. They placed statues in her dedicated spaces and canonized her in the 5th century, making her a saint. Her symbolic cross is seen throughout the countryside and the world. The well attracts visitors year-round and does not lock or close at night. Thousands of mementos, rosaries, prayers, and pieces of clothing have been left in the stone grotto of the well and they continue to spill out into the trees lining the path to the cemetery. Votive candles are often lit 24 hours a day, left by locals and tourists alike. Traditionally, the water of this well should be sipped at the end of a visit to this shrine.

It is not every day that you come across a large stone structure of no particular religious association comprised of interlocking arches and obelisks in the green Irish countryside. What’s more, the Folly’s physical characteristics are not the only ingredient that makes it unique. It was constructed in 1740 at the height of the Irish famine of 1740-1741. It was built so that the local farmers might make some money working on its construction and not starve. In this way, it is a centuries-old precursor to some of the projects of Roosevelt’s New Deal. Katherine Conolly commissioned the structure. Conolly was the widow of William Conolly, who had been a prominent member of the Irish House of Commons and died the richest man in Ireland. The arches and obelisks are decorated with stone eagles and pineapples, and the central obelisk reaches a height of 140 feet. Conolly’s Folly stands on the grounds of Castletown House. One of the largest and most imposing private homes in all of Ireland, it was built for William Conolly and was where his widow lived after his death in 1729. Saved from demolition in the 1960s by Desmond Guinness, the house has been restored, and parts are now open to the public. These days, both the house and Folly itself are part of the Irish Georgian Society, which looks after historical landmarks in Ireland. It is currently being restored through the Office of Public Works, as over the years it has fallen into disrepair. Located on the Castletown Estate outside of Celbridge",follies eccentric homes homes
110,Mound of the Hostages,"Meath, Ireland",An ancient neolithic tomb that only sees the sun twice a year.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mound-of-the-hostages,"The Hill of Tara is home to many ancient ruins and tombs, but none have been studied like the Mound of the Hostages. Built approximately 5,000 years ago, this tomb is thought to be the final resting place of up to 500 people, though exact numbers may never be certain. The mound is circular and is approximately 15 meters in diameter and 3 meters high. The small entrance is inset into the side of the mound and is gated, barring entrance to the tomb but still allowing visitors to peer in. Inside, the stones and walls are decorated with ancient carvings and spirals, thought to have been related to the sun and the moon - an interesting choice since the sun’s light penetrates the tomb only twice every year. Major excavations were undertaken between 1955 and 1959 and the cremated remains of over 200 people were discovered during that time, along with various burial gifts and earthenware. Still more objects related to the burial customs of the people who inhabited Tara between 2500 B.C. and 500 B.C. were found in stone cysts along the walls of the mound. The excavations also uncovered the skeleton of an adolescent boy from the Bronze Age, decorated with a necklace of gems and stones. These finds were considered to be the most comprehensive set of grave goods in all of Ireland and have yet to be surpassed. A close second were those unearthed at the larger passage tomb of Newgrange. More recent explorations have uncovered the underground ruins of a giant henge. It is thought that if the henge were rebuilt today it would surround  the Mound of the Hostages and many of the other ancient places on the Hill of Tara. It would be a vast and imposing monument and could easily rival Stonehenge. As part of the Hill of Tara complex, you will also find the Lia Fáil stone (Stone of Destiny) nearby. It’s important for its association with the inauguration of the Kings of Tara.  It acted as the coronation stone of Ireland, where all of the kings of Ireland were crowned up to Muirchertach mac Ercae. Legend has it whoever can pull the stone-free is the true King of Ireland.

Narcissus Marsh, Archbishop of Dublin, donated many of the books in the library from his personal collection, and is buried nearby on the Cathedral grounds. The library has seen much of Dublin’s history. In some of the bookcases, there are bullet holes from the Easter Rising, when the hotel next door was occupied. A unique feature that still stands is the three wired alcoves, or “cages,” which were created in the late 18th century in response to thefts at the library.

112,The Wonderful Barn,"Leixlip, Ireland",A corkscrew-shaped barn in Ireland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-wonderful-barn-leixlip-ireland,"Barns tend to be thought of as big, red, wooden, and filled with hay and farming tools. Or at least that seems to be the American conception of the barn. In Ireland, the Wonderful Barn fulfills none of these stereotypes. Made out of rock and shaped like a corkscrew it towers above the surrounding countryside, looking more like a medieval keep than a barn. Built in 1743 on the edge of the Castletown estate (also famous for the Conolly Folly which rests on the property), there is some debate over the original intended purpose of the barn. Some have speculated that it may have been used as a dovecote, a place for birds to nest. Doves were considered a delicacy in the 1700s especially when other game was out of season. Others argue that because of the unique holes drilled through each of the floors the most likely use of the barn was as a granary. This would make sense as in the years preceding its construction several famines ravished Ireland. The barn could have been used to store extra grain in case of times of need. Additionally, the barn bears a striking resemblance to an Indian rice store, which may be where the inspiration for the initial design came from. Another possibility is that the barn, much like the Conolly Folly, was constructed as a public works program meant to put destitute farmers who had been hurt by the famine back to work. Interestingly, the staircase scales the exterior of the building, winding around the circumference as it travels upward. This architectural anomaly gives the entire building a slightly corkscrewing effect, as if there were a very slight optical illusion at work. The staircase ends on a flat roof, surrounded by a parapet that furthers the medieval motif of the entire building.

Dispensing cabinets and their contents of brown paper-wrapped prescriptions and rolls of undeveloped film remain intact. The 11 by 14-foot building in Dublin was originally a general practitioner’s consulting room. Pharmacist Frederick William Sweny took over in 1853, and the place operated as a apothecary until 2009. It’s had several owners since then, but their surname remains above the door to this day. In 1904, James Joyce consulted with Sweny for his novel Ulysses. In the book, Leopold Bloom picks up a bar of lemon soap while waiting for a prescription. The “sweet lemony wax” becomes a kind of talisman and features throughout his continuing journey, which is recreated every year on “Bloomsday” (June 16). There was no plan for the place after the pharmacy closed. People continued to wander in, looking for their own lemon soap talisman, and it just evolved into what it is now, a second-hand bookshop run by volunteers. Sweny’s also hosts readings and special events, and every Bloomsday it’s filled to the brim with those on the Ulysses pilgrimage route. The shop encourages folks to come in and browse its book selection, or read a passage from Ulysses. One can even still purchase a bar of “sweet lemony wax” to commemorate the event. Sweny's is opposite the Lincoln Place end of Trinity College Dublin and is around the corner from the birthplace of Oscar Wilde. It is open Monday to Saturday 11:00 - 17:00 and later on Thursdays.

Dubliners responded in force, and to date the quirky, crowdsourced museum exhibits over 5,000 artifacts that have been donated or loaned. Sitting on the edge of St. Stephen’s Green in Dublin, the three floors of the museum are covered in art, articles, pictures, postcards, and other memorabilia related to the city’s 20th century history. There are artifacts from famous Dubliners, like James Joyce’s death mask and a first edition of Ulysses, and famous visitors, like President John F. Kennedy’s lectern. There’s an entire room dedicated to the rise of the band U2, which includes a career timeline and a very comfortable egg chair visitors can sit on. The contents of the museum are certainly eclectic. In addition to things like an unopened bottle of lemonade from 1918 there’s the personal archive of the “Shaking Hand of Dublin,” 10-time Dublin mayor Alfred “Alfie” Byrne, a record holder for his political success. The award-winning museum offers classes for kids about the city’s history, in the hopes of spreading civic pride, and also a program in which Dublin “ambassadors” take first time visitors out for tea or a pint as an introduction to the city’s hospitality. The first floor is free to wander, but the second and third floors are viewed with a guide.The tour includes an optional walk around St. Stephen's Green where the guide points out where in the park the Irish revolution took place and explains more about the statues and buildings.

Though beautiful, it has an alarmingly sinister nickname: Murder Hole Beach. It’s unclear where the beach’s macabre moniker comes from. Some legends say it refers to the tragic tale of a woman who fatally fell—or was potentially pushed—from its cliffs. But in reality, it’s most likely the name is a nod to the wild waters that whip around the shore, as the beach is known for its particularly mighty tides. Regardless of its foreboding name and the genuine dangers of its waters, the beach is worth a visit. This hidden gem has the type of sunkissed, fiery sands you’d expect to find on an Iberian beach. The colorful beach is but one part of a breathtaking Irish landscape, complete with hidden caves and spectacular rock formations. When the tide is out, you can walk to a section of the beach usually separated by the ocean, or clamber over some sharp rocks to reach it instead. When the tide’s out, you can also walk to a small tidal island roughly 50 feet (15 meters) from the shore. The tide isn’t the only thing to be aware of. To reach the beach, you’ll have to cross two fields full of free-roaming animals, namely cows. There are signs about bulls in the fields, but this is not always the case.  It takes approximately 14 minutes to get to Murder Hole Beach from Rosapenna Hotel and Golf Resort, and roughly the same time from Downings. From Letterkenny, it takes 50 minutes to get there added on with a five-minute walk to the beach.",names beaches hidden nature

Opinions differ on why the site is called “Seven Churches.” While the most obvious answer is that is an allusion to the number of structures among the ruins at the site, others think that it may be in reference to a Roman pilgrimage trail that incorporated seven churches. Complicating the issue further are what are said to be the graves of seven saints that are marked with ancient Celtic crosses which could also have contributed to the moniker. Whatever the origin, there are really only two churches on the site, which are surrounded by the footprints of a number of monastic dwellings where the devotees would have lived. The largest and most complete of the ruins, St. Breacan’s Church (“Tempall Bhreacán”), still features ornate stonework and bears the name of a saint that moved to the area in the 5th century. The second church, The Church of the Hollow (“Teampall an Phoill”), was actually added to the site much later, around the 15th century, and is markedly smaller than its larger neighbor, but nonetheless as wondrously intact. The ancient ruins are open to sightseers and pilgrims, but the site is still an active graveyard holding not only the supposed bones of saints, but also the remains of modern locals.

Now, the iron expanse yawns across the River Suir, unused. Usurped by the River Suir Bridge, Old Red Iron is no longer the record holder for longest bridge on the Emerald Isle. Rust scars the metal surface, and plant life and grasses poke up and through the trackbed. It has sat forgotten like this since 1995, obsolete, but beautiful. Built by William Arroll & Co. of Glasgow in 1906, Old Red, once shining and silver, was once the fastest mail route between Cobh’s transatlantic port and London, but that ship sailed in 1967 when a more efficient route was constructed. The line was reopened in 1970 to service a mineral processing plant, which now lies empty and just as discarded as the bridge itself. It ran as the Waterford to Dungarvan line until 1987, but after being closed to the public, the bridge and its track were abandoned for good in 1995, being partially dismantled and then left to rust by 2003. A ghost of its former self, it still has its now-empty control cabin, and smaller cabins at track level where powerful engines once raised and lowered the lift. The bridge is called the Old Red Iron Bridge by the locals, in reference to its new, rusted out appearance, the once glistening silver paint peeled back to expose the defunct span to the moist elements.

Previously the site of an Iron Age hill fort that was conquered by Vikings in 845 AD, the Rock of Dunamase was later home to a 12th century castle. However after passing down through a succession of wealthy families, by 1350 the former castle was just a ruin.  The rock and its crumbling castle sat unused for hundreds of years until military forces finally blew it up in 1650 to prevent its use during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Currently the site is home to the ruins of the earthworks of the former ring-fort as well as the castle ruins, which Sir John Parnell attempted to restore in the 18th century but failed to complete.

119,The Hole of the Sorrows,"Glenslane, Ireland",This singular Irish dolmen is more Frank Lloyd Wright than upright stonehenge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-hole-of-the-sorrows-clare-ireland,"Some call it an Irish Stonehenge. Locals in County Clare, Ireland look on the Poulnabrone dolmen as just another part of the landscape - no different from the low stone ahistorical fences which have boxed up the low rolling land for as long as anyone cares to remember. The meaning of the word “Poulnabrone,” is up for debate - some say it means “the hole of the quern stones,” but the more popular translation of the original Irish is “The Hole of the Sorrows.” The structure - called a “dolmen,” or portal tomb - consists of three portal stones supporting a slightly angled capstone, pointing down to a thicker block like a giant’s welcome mat. Poulnabrone is the only standing structure in sight set against the stark backdrop of the Burren, a massive region covered in fossil-filled Karst limestone formed some 350 million years ago when much of Ireland was covered by a tropical sea. The area is now a national park. The limestone landscape is so vast and barren that it prompted one Cromwellian officer to remark that “it is a country where there is not water enough to drown a man, wood enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury them.” Though it made crop-based agriculture virtually impossible, the limestone is nutrient-rich, and encourages tufts of hardy grass growing up between its cracks - this, as the officer also remarked, kept the cows fat even while their owners starved. Authorities excavated the dolmen between 1985 and 1986 and discovered the remains of at least 16 and possibly over 20 individuals, some adults and some children along with stone tools, jewelry of quartz and bone, and pottery. Though Neolithic inhabitants likely built the dolmen between 4200 and 2900 BCE, some archaeological evidence suggests the area was used as a grave site into the Bronze Age, and likely held ritual or territorial significance well into the Celtic period. Remarkably similar structures - most classified as dolmens - remain standing throughout the world, from India and the Koreas to Africa, Spain, and the British Isles, all dating from the Neolithic. Poulnabrone remains one of the most accessible - almost visible from the Corrofin Road - as well as one of the most impressive, its solidity against the otherwise blank landscape seeming to magnify it, and the angle of its capstone suggesting the work of Frank Lloyd Wright more than Stonehenge. The site remains largely unblemished by tourist-traps or excessive protection: a few signposts detail the site’s history and a low rope rings the dolmen itself. However, given the site’s remote location and the absence of light pollution, the nearby gravel carpark has made Poulnabrone a favorite haunt of stargazers - not unlike, perhaps, the portal tomb’s neolithic architects.  The Poulnabrone dolmen, though remote, is easily accessible off R480.",dolmen standing stones
120,Gap of Dunloe,"Dunloe Upper, Ireland","Traveling this mountain pass reveals quaint stone buildings, stunning Irish scenery, and a bridge said to grant wishes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gap-of-dunloe,"The Gap of Dunloe is a mountain pass that winds through the MacGillycuddy Reeks and Purple Mountain ranges. Glacial flow etched this gap millennia ago. Today, a paved road acts as an asphalt river that flows around each bend and curve. Many people walk through the Gap, as the trail reveals breathtaking vistas of the natural views the Ring of Kerry is famous for. Or, you can hire a jaunting cart (a horse-drawn carriage) and be ferried up the path, the sound of hooves clip-clopping against the pavement providing a soundtrack to your travels. Most people start this fantastical journey on foot at Kate Kearney’s Cottage, where there is an entrance to the trail surrounded by horses and carriages. From here, you’ll walk a trail lined by a low stone fence with the hill on the right and the lake on the left. It’s usually foggy, with clouds draping over the hills, but the weather can change in a minute, bringing sunlight sparkling over the lake and shining across Ireland’s many different green hues. You’ll see the ruins of a stone house, where you may even see a deer hanging around. After walking for about 20 minutes, you’ll arrive at the Wishing Bridge, which is said to make your wishes come true. This is one of the best spots to take pictures of the Gap, as you’ll be rewarded with views of the two mountains ranges appearing to meld in the distance. The Gap is about 6.8 miles from end to end. It’s worth the long, winding walk through the mountains. You’ll pass by a total of five lakes: Coosaun Lough, Black Lake, Cushnavally Lake, Auger Lake, and Black Lough, each equally picture-perfect.  Best way to enter the trail is through Kate Kearney's Cottage. They also offer horse carriages for a fee, but the best way to enjoy is by walking. Cars pass by, so you have to be careful.

However it was not until the 1990s that the subterranean treasure was made accessible to the public. Despite objections from caving enthusiasts, the tight and treacherous entrance to the cave was expanded and a door was placed over the aperture. The interior of the cave was also built out to allow for lay visitors. However after opponents of the plan took the cave owners to court it was decided that no visitors center could be built on the land to keep traffic a bit lower. All turmoil aside the cave was eventually opened, introducing the world to the Great Stalactite, one of the biggest free-hanging formations of its kind in the world.

Before anyone panics, there is already a monastery over the portal called St. Patrick’s Purgatory. The story goes that Jesus showed St. Patrick a cave on Station Island (sometimes described as a “pit” or “well”, of which there are a few shallow ones remaining), in which the saint received visions of the punishments of hell, and was subsequently able to use the site as proof of a Christian afterlife for his wavering followers. Actual history does not confirm whether the saint truly visited the island or if it was simply associated with him later, but the monastic compound constructed on the island exists to this day. Much expanded from its founding in the 15th century, some of the foundation still remains, and the bare stone style of the existing priory buildings recalls the site’s ascetic Christian roots. While casual visitors are not generally allowed on the island, yearly pilgrimage to the site continues to this day where devout worshippers come in droves to take a three-day sojourn of contemplation through the holy site, all while barefoot.

The Famine Memorial sculpture was created by Rowan Gillespie and unveiled in 1997. The sculptures consist of emaciated men and women trudging along the banks of the river, with various expressions of sadness, despair and determination. To really drive the point home, the bronze sculptures also include a starving dog walking behind the people. They are one of the most photographed public art pieces in all of Ireland. This sculpture is a permanent memorial to the many people who emigrated because of Ireland’s Great Famine. It’s built on the departure site of the Perseverance, one of the first famine ships to leave the area in 1846. The ship’s captain was a 74 year old man who quit his office job to transport the starving people from Dublin to America. All passengers arrived safely and the Perseverance was one of the first of thousands of ships to make that epic crossing. Statistics estimate that even now there are more Irish people living outside of Ireland than within its borders, and this haunting piece is a stark reminder of when that emigration began and why. Just a few steps away from the sculpture is a tall ship moored in the water that is set up as a famine museum.

124,Puck's Castle,"Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Ireland","There might not be much left of these Irish ruins, but their linguistic legacy is still going strong.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pucks-castle,"Some say that Puck’s Castle, in Rathmichael Co. Dublin, was built from sacred stones culled from the nearby Bearna Dhearg (or “ringfort”), but little is really known for certain about the structure today. Because of the “sacred stones” story, Puck’s – an English derivative of the Gaelic “púca” or “pooka” meaning ghost or spirit – is said to be haunted. Many languages have similar words to “púca” – in Iceland there is “puki”; “piskey” in Cornish (that’s where we get the word “pixie”); “pwcca” in Welsh (try saying that ten times fast); and “pawkey” in Scottish. It’s where Shakespeare got the name “Puck”, meaning “fairie”, for A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Whether it’s a curse, or a haunting, or just neglect, Puck’s Castle sits today in silent ruins, mostly visited by grazing cattle and the occasional fence-hopper. The castle dates to sometime around 1500, and as a fortified homestead it was part of a number of defensive buildings similarly erected in the area from that period. Rathmichael, southeast of Dublin, is a suburb in ruins; or rather, a suburb WITH ruins. In addition to the Castle there are also church ruins that are near the ruins of the old ringfort (ringforts are common in Ireland, being medieval circular fortified settlements). The church may (or may not – that’s another mystery) have been built in dedication to a saint named “Mac Táil” (that’s right – “Michael”) so we get the Irish name of “Ráth Mhic Táil,” which would translate to “ringfort of Mac Táil,” or the English variation: Rathmichael. There is no way to know for sure about this either, but the castle may also have given James II (who lived from 1633 to 1701) a waystation as he retreated during the Battle of The Boyne in 1690. He eventually retreated all the way back to France, and never came back to Ireland to let us know for sure. So while much of the history of the castle is shrouded in mystery, there is also very little of the castle left intact. But inside you can see evidence of the stone stairwell and the fireplace – most everything else is long gone and crumbling. The grounds are usually behind a locked fence, but it’s not far off Puck’s Castle Lane, so you can visit – but may need to sense the Púca’s spirit through some chain link.",castles medieval churches sacred spaces ruins
125,The Butter Museum,"Cork, Ireland",This Irish museum in a historic 19th century market pays tribute to the glory of butter.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cork-butter-museum,"If Guinness is Ireland’s most important liquid export, butter takes the cake (the stick?) as one of its most important food exports. The Cork Butter Museum tells its story, going back as far as their prized possession — a wooden barrel of thousand year old bog butter. The Museum is in the Shandon section of Cork, the historic market center of the city. Known at the time as a “shambles,” open markets and butcheries like this one go back centuries. Cattle and dairy farming had traditionally been the most important domestic industries in Ireland, and beginning in the 1700s the export market for Irish butter began to flourish. By the mid-1800s the market in Cork had the largest butter exchange in the world, and Irish butter could be found on tables across the globe, from North America to the Caribbean to India. Housed in the former market, the Cork Butter Museum is next to the Firkin Crane Building, an unusual rotunda that was originally part of the exchange. Built in 1855, it sits on the site of the medieval Shandon Castle, and today is a public performance space. The museum also tells the story of how Kerrygold came to prominence in the international butter market in the second half of the 20th century. Tracing its roots all the way back to that thousand year old bog butter, Kerrygold (a product of the Irish Dairy Board, Ireland’s dairy cooperative) has continued the tradition of exported Irish butter. It still makes its way around the globe, sitting in just about every dairy case next to the Land-o-Lakes and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter.  The Museum is in the Shandon section of Cork (the old market centre) near the River Lee, between Dominick St. and Church St. It's open daily from March to October, 10am to 5pm. From November to February it is open only on the weekends, from 11am to 3pm. There are regular butter-making demonstrations.

According to local lore, it’s home to Ireland’s last leprechauns. In 2010, Carlingford, Ireland earned official European Union recognition for its leprechauns. The Sliabh Foy Loop Trail became a sanctuary for the country’s remaining leprechauns—236 in total—and nearby Slieve Foye Mountain gained protection under the European Habitats Directive, which protects flora, fauna, and apparently, magical fairies. It’s easy to see why leprechauns would choose this mountain as their home, as it is spellbindingly beautiful. The Sliabh Foy Loop Trail begins in Carlingford, then winds its way toward the protected reserve. Even if you don’t spot any leprechauns lurking within the mountain’s crags and crannies, the walk is still worth it. You’ll pass through splendid Irish scenery, and likely meet a few sheep along the way. Carlingford itself has a unique history with the magical creatures. In the 1980s, local businessman PJ O’Hare discovered a tiny hat, jacket, and trousers with gold coins in its pockets lying near a patch of burned earth. This prompted the start of the annual Carlingford National Leprechaun Hunt, an event where locals scour the mountain in search of the elusive creatures.  To hike, be prepared with proper hiking boots and rain gear. You can park near the tourist office in nearby Carlingford.

Inside, it’s filled with many meeting rooms boasting fantastic architectural features and styles, making a walk through the building feel like a trip around the globe. The rooms are all stuffed with hidden details that hint at the mysterious group the building serves. The Grand Chapter Room is Egyptian-style and even contains two sphinx. The Knight Templar Preceptory room takes the style of a Templar Chapel with stained glass windows. The Prince Masons’ Room has a gorgeous Gothic Tudor-style look with a design inspired partially by St. Patrick’s Cathedral, particularly the Choir Stalls of the Knights of The Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick. During the Irish Civil War, the building was seized by the “irregulars” (anti-treaty IRA) for six weeks but thankfully remained unscathed. Colonel Claude Cane, the Deputy Grand Secretary, commented at the time that no damage had been caused and paid tribute to the Provisional Government for their negotiations for the return of the building. Freemasonry is no longer referred to as a “secret society” but rather a society with secrets. If you book a tour of the lodge, a guide will be happy to answer all questions … except when he can’t! If you’re lucky enough, you may be shown something in the Grand Chapter Room that won’t be apparent at first sight. Freemason's Hall is across from Buswells Hotel and near the main entrance to Dail Eireann, the Irish Parliament. The museum is open to the public and tours of the building are held at 2.30 p.m. each weekday during June, July, and August. The cost per head is €2 and no booking is necessary, just turn up. Outside of those months private and group tours can be arranged by contacting staff at the Hall.",masonic temples masons architecture
128,Kilmacduagh Round Tower,"Galway, Ireland",The ruins of an 800-year-old monastery boasts the tallest round tower in Ireland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kilmacduagh-round-tower,"There is a hush in Kilmacduagh, where the ruins of a monastery destroyed some 800 years ago still stand. The ruins are impressive enough, but the round tower—the tallest in Ireland at 34.5m, and in immaculate condition—is staggering. Around 65 round towers are known in various states of decay throughout Ireland. However their origin and purpose is debated. Hypotheses include that they were used as bell towers, or as protection against raids. Kilmacduagh’s round tower excels in terms of its condition, location and height. A rope ladder would be the only means of access to a door 8m above the ground. Whatever the purpose of the buildings was, the builders performed their task well; the tower survives nearly 1000 years after it was built, despite its obvious lean. Situated in the village graveyard, Kilmacduagh’s ruins are a spiritual place of contemplation and silence. The karst landscape of County Clare’s Burren provides the horizon. The limestone rock for the buildings adds to the picturesque scene, and may be the reason the ruins still stand today.  There is very little historical information available.

The grand manor house was first built in 1770 by Irish politician Rob Carew. The three-story house was a grand piece of architecture in its day, its opulence most apparent in the two-story entryway flanked by grand Corinthian columns. it also became known for its grand gardens which were opened to the public with a noted generosity of use. It was estimated that the estate cost a whopping £200,000, all of which was for naught when faced with fire and rebellion. The first fire to ravage portions of the mansion broke out in 1840, and accident that destroyed a good portion of the manse, leaving only the west wing untouched. However, the house was mainly rebuilt and refurbished by the early 20th century. for all of the good it did. In 1923, as a result of “The Troubles,” IRA sympathizers performed a terrifying raid that ended up burning the home once again. A calamity from which the property would never recover. Castleboro House has been left in ruins since it was destroyed, home to urban explorers and memories of a once grand life.

The abbey was originally built in the 19th century as a residence by the Henry family. It was later sold to the Duke of Manchester, then to a banker, and then it became home to an order of Benedictine nuns who fled the Continent in World War I. In 1923, it became Kylemore Abbey School, and ran as such until 2010.

131,Charleville Castle,"Tullamore, Ireland","An 1814 castle that hosts an exhibit of ""explorabilia"".",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/charleville-castle,"Despite explorers having a role in creating museum collections around the world, there was no museum dedicated to the history of exploration until the Explorers Museum opened in a Gothic Irish castle. Colonel Charles Kenneth Howard-Bury, an amateur botanist, led the 1920 Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition. He was also the last inhabitant of Charleville Castle. Fittingly, the Explorer’s Museum, a nonprofit group of adventurers and scientists, hosts meetings and exhibitions in Charleville Castle. Founded in 2014, the Explorer’s Museum aims to celebrate the significant contributions of exploration through exhibitions on specific expeditions and iconic and overlooked figures in history. The museum’s first exhibit was dedicated to Howard-Bury himself, in homage to his life at the castle and his exploration far beyond it. The group also hosts regular meetings and events at which they discuss and plan expeditions, from deep sea dives to filming solar eclipses with drones. Charleville Castle itself prompts exploration. Its walls once housed the likes of Lord Byron, who favored the space for raucous Romantic parties. Apart from the well-kept exhibition and museum space inside the castle proper, the rest of the estate has fallen into disrepair. The crumbling stables and other Charleville buildings are shrouded in vines, making them the perfect destination for would-be explorers. Surrounding the estate are ancient woods, believed to be the hunting grounds of druids. Here you can find a 900-year-old tree known as the “King Oak.” Legend has it that if a branch falls from the tree, a member of the Bury family is soon to die. And of course, no castle is complete without its ghosts - Charleville Castle is believed to be haunted by Harriet, an 8-year-old who fell from the grand staircase to her death.",exploration castles museums and collections museums
132,Murdering Lane and Cutthroat Lane,"Dublin, Ireland","Though they've since been renamed, these two streets hint at Dublin's darker days.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/murdering-lane-and-cutthroat-lane,"Place names can be endlessly fascinating, particularly for the insight they give about a place’s history. Sometimes they reveal portions of a city’s less-than-ideal past, as is the case with Dublin’s Murdering Lane and Cutthroat Lane. If old city streets referred to the chosen activities of their inhabitants, then Cutthroat Lane and Murdering Lane were hardly hot tourist spots of their time. City maps from the late 18th century record a Cutthroat Lane East and a Cutthroat Lane West, in case you were unsure where the murderous deed occurred. However, the road now has the more decorous name of Brookfield Road although, for a time, it was called Roundhead Row. Close to Cutthroat Lane, there’s another laneway, a steep, stepped climb from the River Camac and Bow Lane to James’s Street. A city map from 1603 records this lane’s name as “Murd’ring Lane” which later became Murdering Lane. That name was changed again to Cromwell’s Quarters at a Municipal Council meeting of December 28, 1876, following the recommendations of a council committee to change the names of both of the unfortunately named lanes. The change was proposed by Alderman McSwiney, who suggested the names be replaced by Roundhead Row and Cromwell’s Quarter’s, respectfully. When asked to explain his proposed changes, McSwiney is reported to have replied, “to preserve historical continuity.” This, according to contemporary reports, was greeted with laughter as Oliver Cromwell’s sojourn in Ireland from 1649 to 1653, accompanied by his New Model Army, distinctive for their round-headed helmets, was both brutal and bloody. The GPS coordinates lead to the road that was once Cut Throat Lane.

133,Great Blasket Island,"Kerry, Ireland",Just a few miles off the western coast of Ireland lies an isle steeped in Irish literary history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-blasket-island,"“There are so many strange things in the world beyond our knowledge, and maybe there are ghosts too, though I do not understand why they should come back to this world when they have gone from it.” From The Western Island by Peig Sayers The Blasket Islands, a rugged six-island archipelago off the Dingle Peninsula – the western-most tip of Ireland (in Irish called An Blascaod Mór) – seem particularly close to the Irish soul. Besides its natural beauty and connection to a long-gone life of the sea, it was home to three of the most loved and revered writers in the Irish language, Peig Sayers, Muiris Ó Súilleabháin, and Tomás Ó Criomhthain. Great Blasket is the main island of this archipelago, which is part of County Kerry. While only about three miles off the coast at its closest point, it is often shrouded in fog – an island apparition set in the Celtic Sea. The Islands are now uninhabited, but there were residents living and working on Great Blasket until the middle of the 20th century. The small fishing community had shrunk to only 27 people by then, from a high of about 150 (that’s according to the Irish census of 1841, so maybe there were even more in earlier decades and centuries, before census records were kept). The island itself is accessible by ferry or chartered excursion, and there is also a mainland Blasket Island Centre in Dingle, which chronicles and celebrates the history of the islands, their fishing heritage, and impact on the literature of the Irish language. The waning of small-scale fishing, and young people leaving the island and its isolated way of life, meant inevitable decline for any continuing community. Finally, in 1953, the Irish government moved the few remaining inhabitants off the island, unable to provide them with support or services. The island lay deserted and crumbling for the next five decades, until efforts to open it up for day visits meant it would see some human life again. In 2009 the government bought most of the island for preservation of its natural environment, its deserted village, and its continuing connection to the sea, the snotgreen sea, the scrotumtightening sea (with apologies to James Joyce). Regular ferry service in season between Dingle town and the Blasket Islands; group and chartered rides available locally during off-season (see website).

134,Rindoon,"Lecarrow, Ireland",Wander among the abandoned ruins of this once-powerful medieval town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rindoon,"On a sleepy, off-the-beaten-track peninsula jutting into Ireland’s River Shannon, you can wander through Rindoon, one of Ireland’s most enigmatic deserted medieval towns. Though it was once one of the area’s most important towns, it has slept undisturbed for centuries. Rinn Dúin, the old Gaelic name, means “fortified headland.” Lured by its rich pastures and long vistas over the River Shannon, humans have lived on this beautiful peninsula long before invading Anglo-Normans first landed in its safe harbor in the late 12th century. A key military and trading frontier town between the warring provinces of Connacht and Leinster, Rindoon was a pawn in the wars waged between native Irish chieftains and Norman barons. Over the centuries, it has witnessed bloody battles, sieges, executions, and wholesale pillage as it changed hands repeatedly between the armies. Rindoon was one of a string of fortifications the Normans built to dominate the Shannon, strategically situated between the Norman strongholds of Athlone and Roscommon. The town itself lies behind a fortified wall, 20 feet high and 1,640 feet long, with towers and gates running across the St. John’s peninsula, protecting it from the mainland. The brutal Geoffrey de Marisco built the castle around 1227. Legends of Marisco’s corruption and treachery still linger in local folklore. Finally, even the Normans grew fed up with him, and he and his son William were outlawed and their lands—including Rindoon—were confiscated by the Crown. Undaunted, father and son took to the sea and became pirates, regularly raiding ships between Drogheda and Dublin. At its height, experts say the population of Rindoon was about 1,000 people, an impressive number for a time when the population of London was approximately 20,000. Safe Harbour was the main landing point for the town’s trade which, in its heyday, was highly profitable. Records show that in 1259, the town paid £8-5-8 in annual taxes, and by 1285 when taxes had risen to £320, the town was importing corn, cloth, and wine from Bordeaux. But the once-thriving town was not destined to survive. Historians say its isolated location made it too vulnerable to attacks from local Gaelic chieftains and too expensive to protect. The settlement’s isolation from other major trading centers didn’t help. And, as with other settlements, the Black Death may have visited Rindoon in the 14th century, hastening its decline. Now, the deserted town consists of a harbor, a castle, a church, and a substantial windmill. Just beyond the walls lie the ruins of an even older building, a 12th-century hospital that predates the walled town. You can still make out some plots around the castle where houses and gardens once stood, giving tantalizing glimpses of everyday life of Rindoon’s medieval citizens. Farther along are the massive cylindrical ruins of a windmill, first appearing in the records in 1273 when one Richard Le Charpentier got 45 shillings for steel to construct the mill. The surviving three-story-high mill dates back to the 17th century, although the mound on which it stands may have been part of the medieval mill used to grind local crops.  Just a few miles outside Athlone, a well-signposted looped walk takes you around the headland, the deserted town, and the adjoining woodlands.

135,John Kavanagh ('The Gravediggers'),"Dublin, Ireland",This pub built its reputation pouring post-shift pints for employees of the cemetery with which it shares a wall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/john-kavanagh-the-gravediggers,"John Kavanagh—better known by its nickname, “The Gravediggers”—was built into the wall of Glasnevin Cemetery. Established in 1833, the bar started off as a gift from John’s hotelier father-in-law. In its early years, Kavanagh’s was a funeral-adjacent business, with mourners leaving hearses outside to come in and drink away their pain. When they dispersed, gravediggers filled the pub’s seats. So many grievers showed up drunk to—or were altogether absent from—funerals that the city cemetery committee enacted a bylaw to restrict burials to the mornings. The pub took a hit in the period afterward, which was only made worse when Glasnevin closed the nearby eastern gate into the cemetery in 1878. To attract new customers, John’s son, Joseph, added games, including a shooting range. Subsequent family members added a grocery in 1920, a lounge in the 1980s, and a food menu in the early 2000s. Today, seventh-generation Kavanaghs take turns manning the original bar counter. Signs of age appear in the low ceilings and wood floor, damaged by well over a century’s worth of spilled Guinness and spat tobacco. An area where women once drank separately from men remains sectioned-off (just to preserve the historical scene; in actuality, anyone can drink there). Phone calls and music (“piped or otherwise”) are not allowed. The pub adopted its nickname within the last couple decades—both because of its history as a gravediggers’ haunt, and because legend has it that the cemetery workers had unique ways of ordering their drinks. One unproven rumor is that the brews used to be passed through a hole in the cemetery wall. The other story holds that the gravediggers would knock on the wall to let the bartender know he should waste no time readying their post-shift pints. Although both legends are entertaining, historian Ciarán Wallace says they seem “unlikely and unnecessary as the wall and gate and pub door are only 10 paces apart.” The cemetery-adjacent pub is also known for attracting a few spirits. Many of its bartenders have a ghost story from their time there and a few regulars claim to have seen loved ones who’d been buried in Glasnevin. On more than one occasion, patrons have spotted a spirit simply as “the man in tweed,” a dapper fellow with a preference for Guinness.  Prospect Square can be tricky to find, but it is located southeast of Glasnevin/Prospect Cemetery and the adjacent Botanic Gardens. Ask for the pub by name, when ordering a taxi, or ask the Bus Drivers if their route number passes by. Many buses to and from Finglas and Glasnevin will pass close by Prospect Square if they go to and from the city center.",beer bars graveyards restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars cemeteries history
136,The Oscar Wilde House,"Dublin, Ireland",The house where the writer spent his formative years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-oscar-wilde-house,"Oscar Wilde spent his formative years in this Dublin home. Attending his mother’s iconic salons from an early age, he was able to sharpen his wit and become one of the greatest Victorian playwrights. A colorful statue of Oscar Wilde still looks on from across the street on his Merrion Square perch. His face smirks and frowns depending on how you look at it. The building has a medical history, too. Sir William Wilde, Oscar’s father, ran Dublin’s most prestigious eye and ear medical practice out of the family residence. In 1863, he was appointed oculist ordinary to Queen Victoria, and in 1864 he was knighted. At the end of that very year, he was accused of sexually assaulting an anesthetized female patient under his care. The American College Dublin runs the house tours, which take visitors through various rooms including the Wildes’ dining room, sitting room, and Sir William’s infamous surgery. The college also holds lectures here.

The floor of the cross is lined with mosaics of shattered swords and broken shields - echoing the rituals of ancient clans who would break their weapons at the end of battle and throw them into the rivers or large bodies of water to symbolize the end of a conflict. The Garden of Remembrance commemorates all Irish uprisings and rebellions from 1798 through Ireland’s more recent “Troubles” of the 20th century. It also features a large statue created by Oisín Kelly of the Children of Lir that signifies rebirth and resurrection and is based on a famous Irish myth regarding the transformation of the daughters of king into swans by a jealous stepmother, their subsequent exile, and their symbolic return. It is built on the site of where the Irish Volunteers were founded in 1913 and it was unveiled in 1966, exactly fifty years after they joined the short-lived but effective rebellion known as the Easter Rising of 1916. It is a garden steeped in Nationalist history, and it is lined with harps and other symbols of the Irish Republican movement.

These old houses, all worn and battered by time, stand as humble testaments to the island’s medieval stonemasons. There are beehive houses, or clochán, all over County Kerry, including at the spectacular Skellig Michael. But this particular group is said to be the most remarkable in the country. The exact age of the houses is uncertain, and different theories date them anywhere from the eighth to 12th centuries AD. It’s likely hermit monks and followers of Saint Peter once lived in them, though pagans may have also called some of the cone-shaped structures home even earlier. At one point in history, more than 400 of these intriguing abodes dotted the hillside. Though many have vanished over time, a significant number still stand. You can walk right up to—and sometimes even into—the houses to admire the stonework that has let these clochán weather centuries of wind, rain, and curious sheep. The builders of these beehive houses didn’t use any mortar. Instead, they meticulously stacked rings of stone one on top of the other, positioning each layer a little further inward until a snug, pointed roof was formed to cap the structure. This corbelling method is part of the reason why the huts are so difficult to date, as it doesn’t belong to any one time period and has been used in Ireland for thousands of years.",forts roadside attractions medieval houses homes architecture

While the Gallarus Oratory is considered to have been a church or religious meeting site of some sort, its true purpose is still unknown although there are nearby Celtic burial sites which have led some researchers to believe that it had some funerary significance.

Found in the center of County Roscommon, it contains about 240 identified archaeological sites packed within an area of about 2.5 square miles. This landscape confidently bears witness to nearly 5,500 years of continuous settlement. The earliest known monument is a small court tomb from the early Neolithic Period. Bronze and Iron Age burial mounds dot the earth. You’ll also find traces of massive feats of late Iron Age architecture such as the Rathcroghan Mound and the Mucklaghs earthworks as well as early historic settlement sites and religious foundations. The later medieval period sees Rathcroghan divided into a large matrix of field systems, evidence of the pastoral farming practice common to this region from prehistory up to the present day. This area, perhaps unsurprisingly, is also one of the key theaters of Ireland’s impressive collection of intoxicating mythology and literature. It boasts the mythological gateway into the Irish Otherworld: the cave of Oweynagat. Uaimh na gCat (Gaelic for “Cave of the Cats”) is the origin place of the pre-Christian seasonal celebration of Samhain, the Celtic precursor to modern Halloween. Rathcroghan is the starting point for a whole series of Iron Age heroic cattle raiding tales, known as na Tána. Indeed, the central tale of the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, an Táin Bó Cúailnge, Ireland’s greatest epic, rises out of Rathcroghan, at the behest of the famous Iron Age Warrior Queen Medb (Maeve) of Connacht. Medb is a vital part of this landscape, and of the West more generally, and her capitol and palace are reputed to be located on the Rathcroghan landscape. These stories record the deeds of Ireland’s heroes, such as Cú Chulainn, Fráoch, the Morrigan, Conor Mac Nessa, Ferdia, and Medb herself. Many of these archaeological sites retain links to these heroic tales through their names, among them Reilig na Rí (the Cemetery of Kings), Caiseal Mhanannán (the stone fort of Manannán mac Lír, god of the sea), Rath na dtarbh (the fort of the bulls), Daithí’s Stone, and more.

A former schoolteacher from Dublin, Dermot Morgan broke into comic acting in the late 1970s. He became a household name in the late 1980s for his work on the RTÉ radio show Scrap Saturday, which satirized the Irish politics of the day on either side of the political spectrum as well as business and church leaders and policy. When the show was cancelled in 1991, there were accusations of political interference. Morgan would score the role of Father Ted Crilly in the British Channel Four sitcom Father Ted in 1995. The sitcom lasted three series and won multiple BAFTA Awards. One of three Catholic priests exiled to an eccentric parish on an island off the west coast of Ireland, Father Crilly with his weakness for money and great desire for fame headlined a cast that included many Irish comedians throughout its run. The series became a cultural touchstone in Ireland and beyond. Right after the final episode of the last series wrapped production, Morgan and his family hosted a dinner party at his London home. But at this party, almost 24 hours after the final scene was shot, Dermot Morgan suffered a massive heart attack and died on February 28, 1998, at age 45. At his funeral mass, two Irish Presidents, Mary McAleese and Mary Robinson, were in attendance as well as other political and church leaders, who were often the targets of his satire. His memorial is the Joker’s Chair in Merrion Square, Dublin. The joker, or jester, is the entertainer who was able to criticize the royal court.

Since their big move, the wallaby population has thrived on the small island and has grown in size since first introduced.

146,'Kindred Spirits' Sculpture,"Cork, Ireland",A tribute to the incredible generosity the Choctaw Nation showed the Irish people during the Great Famine.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kindred-spirits-sculpture,"The year 1847 was an extremely difficult one for the Irish people. Known as “Black 47,” this was the worst year of the famine in Ireland, where close to one million people were starving to death. Humanitarian aid came from around the world, but the unexpected generosity of the Choctaw Nation stands out, and began a bond between the two people that continues to this day. The Choctaw Native Americans raised $170 of their own money—equivalent to thousands of dollars today— in aid to supply food for the starving Irish. This exemplifies the incredible generosity of the Choctaw people, because just 16 years before, they were forced by U.S. President Andrew Jackson to leave their ancestral lands and march 500 miles on the “Trail of Tears,” in terrible winter conditions. Many did not survive. Today, the Irish people are still grateful for the generosity of the Choctaw people. A monument stands in Midleton’s Bailick Park as a tribute to the tribe’s charity during the Great Famine. Named “Kindred Spirits,” the magnificent memorial features nine giant stainless steel feathers, shaped into an empty bowl. The creator, artist Alex Pentak, explained, “I wanted to show the courage, fragility and humanity that they displayed in my work.” Beyond the monument, there are many other examples of the continued link between the Irish and Choctaw people. In 1990, several Choctaw leaders took part in the first annual Famine walk at Doolough in County Mayo; two years later, Irish commemoration leaders walked the 500 mile length of the Trail of Tears. A former Irish president is now an honorary Choctaw Chief. Most importantly, both Choctaw and Irish people now work together to provide assistance for people suffering from famine worldwide.

The tradition of shaping box hedges goes back centuries; in Roman times, Pliny the Elder described box hedges grown along pleasant paths. Birr Castle’s box hedge was first planted 300 years ago and, at close to 40 feet, it’s the tallest box hedge in the world, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The box hedge is part of the castle’s formal grounds, which have been cultivated by generations of the Parsons family, who settled in the castle in 1620. The seventh Earl of Rosse still lives there and pay close attention to the garden, which include a lovely hornbeam cloister walk. The castle also has giant telescope, originally built in the 1840s by the third Earl of Rosse.",records world's tallest gardens trees plants

Scattered among two lakes and lush woods are numerous structures, mostly from between the 10th and 12 centuries. Among them are a magnificent gateway, a handful of chapels, a cathedral, and a large stone cross; however, the most iconic is the 30-meter-high Round Tower that looks like something straight out of a fairy tale. All of them were made with delicate and beautiful masonry and walking throughout the valley one can’t help but understand why the ancient monks chose this location for their sanctuary. The tall tower, which is situated just beyond the equally ancient cemetery, was used for a number of purposes. In times of trouble it served to protect the monks from their enemies, and in friendlier times it was also used as a bell tower. Inside the spire are six wooden floors that could be ascended via a series of ladders. While the entrance to the tower is pointed towards the monastery, the top floor of the structure features windows pointed in each of the cardinal directions. Aside from the man-made sights, there are the two lakes, the lovely little river, and gorgeous mountains all around, although it is the unmistakably ancient structures that make Glendalough stand out among the rest of Ireland’s beautiful landscapes.",towers ancient
149,Tetrapod Trackway,"Kerry, Ireland",Petrified footprints of one of the very first vertebrates to walk on land.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tetrapod-trackway,"About 385 million years ago, a primitive vertebrate walked through the muddy coastline of Ireland’s Valentia Island, dragging its lizard-like tail behind it as it climbed ashore. Incredibly, the tracks it left behind were preserved and can still be seen today, a snapshot of one of the very first transitions of life from the sea to the land. These prehistoric footprints were preserved by silt and turned to rock over the years, and today the petrified Tetrapod Trackway is among the oldest evidence in the world of four-legged vertebrates—animals with backbones—walking on land. These early amphibians, of course, eventually evolved into mammals, and ultimately into humans. The Tetrapod Trackway on Valentia Island have been dated to the Devonian Period and are between 350 million and 370 million years old. It is one of four similar trackways currently existing in the world: There are others in Tarbet Ness, Scotland; Genoa River, NSW Australia; and Glen Isla, Victoria Australia.  The parking lot is located at N 51° 55.770 W 010° 20.749. The car ferry from Renard Point only operates from April to October. The path from the car park to the site is not handicapped accessible. Parts of it are steep and can be slippery in wet weather. The Trackway is free and is open year round. Follow the small signs reading Tetrapod trackway on Valentia Island. The prints are down a small road in the very north east corner of the Island, near the Grotto. Valentia Island is accessible via a ferry from Renard Point to Knightstown, or from a toll-free bridge from Portmagee. Paved, albeit narrow, twisting, and sometimes steep roads lead from both Knightstown and the Portmagee bridge to a small car park. Visitors can then walk down a quarter-mile path to the site. An information board provides historical information about the site and a short path with steps leads visitors to the shore where they can view the footprints.",prehistoric fossils animals

The top of the structure is blanketed by a verdant layer of grass. Below, wind-whipped water thrashes against the cliffs. Though the name implies multiple bridges, there’s actually only one. Originally, the area boasted three incredible natural sea arches. But after centuries of erosion—the very same phenomenon that created the geological features—two of them crumbled into the sea below, leaving one surviving bridge. You can’t see the natural bridge from the road, but it’s worth the short trek along the cliffs. It’s a fantastic spot to watch the wild Atlantic Ocean. With the sun at your back, you can watch the waves churn toward the shore beneath a seemingly endless expanse of sky. If you’re a keen birder, you’ll definitely want to turn your eyes skyward, as the Bridges of Ross is a great spot for birdwatching. During the autumn migration, thousands of seabirds fly close to the shore during their southward travels. Keep an eye out for species like Manx Shearwater, Storm Petrels, Little Auks, and more.  There's a free car park with picnic tables. Don’t do what most visitors do—walk to the cliff, take a few pictures, and then return to the car.

Nowhere might this be better proven than Aras na nGael, an Irish-speaking bar that offers nightly crash courses on all things Irish language and culture. Galway’s Gaelic little secret isn’t the only one of its kind. Its sister bar in Dublin outright forbids the English language. Over in Galway, however, they’ve taken a more lenient approach to keeping their national language alive. Enter through a traditional stone archway and walk down an unsuspecting path where you’ll find a welcoming watering hole for the curious of mind. Each night of the week is themed to help foreigners acclimate to traditional Irish living. Monday is “beginner’s night,” where newcomers to the ancient language can gain some confidence in their speaking and comprehension. Later on, there’s also a beginner’s music circle, where novice accordion, viola, and guitar players can jam on traditional Irish tunes. Tuesday is “student night,” where foreigners can come and mingle over a pint or five and work their language skills on the local bartenders.

152,Athenry Dominican Priory,"Athenry, Ireland",Ruins battered by centuries of war and disaster offer a wondrous glimpse of medieval Ireland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/athenry-dominican-priory,"Located east of Galway city, the small town of Athenry is considered one of the most well-preserved medieval sites in Ireland. The town boasts several architectural features from the Middle Ages, including a Dominican priory dating back to the 13th century. Through battered by centuries of war and disasters, these ruins still offer a wondrous glimpse into the town’s medieval past. Stone features like the lighted window frames and tomb niches have survived for centuries, making the ruins a fine example of the “School of the West” monastic architecture favored in medieval Connacht. The floor of the church is filled with grave slabs, and a gated crypt beside the main structure houses additional tombs. Members of the de Bermingham family are interred within the crypt, which is generally closed to the public. The town of Athenry was founded by Meiler de Bermingham following the Norman Invasion of Connacht in the 1230s. As the settlement took shape, walls were built around the town and space was designated for a church. With the assistance of Meiler’s personnel, Dominican friars began construction in 1241. The priory was one of the first of such churches built within the city walls. Construction was completed in 1261. Extensions were added to the original structure in the 1300s, including a transept with an ornate north window. In the 1400s, a fire broke out within the church and much of the building was damaged. A tower was added to the central structure during the reconstruction, but all that remains now are the initial foundations. Near the end of the Cromwellian War in Ireland, English soldiers damaged many of the headstones and other structures at the priory. Among more modern additions, the locals built a handball alley along the west side. For anyone staying in Galway, the town of Athenry is about 30 minutes out from the city and serves as a worthwhile detour on the way to the Cliffs of Moher. The priory is a quick walk away from Athenry Castle. The priory interior may be gated off.

153,Knocknakilla Stone Circle,"Cork, Ireland","Just another ancient, mysterious Irish stone circle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/knocknakilla-stone-circle,"Knocknakilla Stone Circle is a small prehistoric complex consisting of a stone circle, two standing stones, and a cairn. Probably erected in the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1600 - 1800 BCE), they were likely used for rituals or ceremonies. Typical of these types of monuments, the alignments of the standing stones and circle were probably influenced by observations of solar and lunar cycles. The stone circle has five large stones, although two have collapsed. The entrance to the circle faces northeast. In 1931, the interior of the circle was excavated and was found to be paved with stones, with quartz pebbles concentrated around the entrance, but no artifacts were found. The two standing stones–one of which fell about 50 years ago–are to the southwest of the circle. The cairn is just east of the stone circle and is defined by a circle of eleven stones. Knocknakilla is derived from the Gaelic “Cnoc na Cille,” which means “Hill of the Church.” The site is located on the slopes of Mushera (or Musherabeg) Mountain just outside Millstreet Country Park, about eleven kilometers from Millstreet, County Cork. If you follow signs from Millstreet toward Millstreet Country Park, go just past the park entrance and turn right.

The once industrious mine was used to unearth barite, a mineral used in cement as an aggregate, or ground down and used as a filler or extender. It’s an agent in the sugar refining process, a white pigment in paint and paper, and used as a weighting agent in oil and gas exploration mining, among many other industrial-type things. Using a cable car system, the barite was brought down Benbulbin, a large rock formation that is a part of the Dartry Mountains. Starting in 1894, barite was pulled out of this limestone-rich monolith for more than 80 years before the well ran dry, so to speak. While the buildings are long gone and the equipment has groaned to a rusty halt, the mine leaves an incredibly large amount of decaying structure to be seen. A good portion of the 1940s turn-style remains, as well as pylons and wire ropes where the cable cars once ran line down the slope of the mountain. Wooden planks covering deep pits that once held ore are still present, along with the concrete structure that holds the rubble of what was once the rock crusher. Geologically speaking, these mountains are mostly limestone, with the Benbulben formation transitioning into shale. There are fossilized seashells all throughout every layer, and even some coral in the lower sections. In the mines themselves you can still see calcite and quartz-lined cavities, and if you look up from the rocks and out into the landscape, Crockauns summit can be seen in the distance. The mine is a very unsafe location, and the access track is on private property.",abandoned mines mines industrial geology
155,Kells Priory,"Kilkenny, Ireland",These imposing walls and towers look more like the ruins of a fortress than a monastery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kells-priory,"With their imposing walls and seven stoic towers, these ruins look like they belong to a long-lost fortress rather than a priory. It’s easy to imagine that it was nobles and knights, not monks, who once strolled within the walls of what locals have nicknamed the “Seven Castles.” But these ruins did indeed belong to a monastery. The Augustinian priory was founded in 1193. Its stone walls wrap around a lush three-acre patch of earth along the King’s River. The priory weathered centuries of turbulence. It was burned down three times durings its first 150 years, and it’s believed the intimidating towers were built as a result of the fiery attacks it suffered. Fortunately, these fires didn’t destroy some of the land’s older treasures. A ninth-century Celtic cross stands proudly within the ruins, which is said to guard the burial place of Niall Caille, a High King of Ireland. The priory was shuttered as part of the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries. Now, its only visitors are curious tourists and many, many sheep. If you’re lucky and visit on a good day, you can meet the local historian, who may open one of the towers and allow you to climb to the top. While up there, you’ll have serene 360-degree views of the area, which will let you spot a quaint stream with a bridge.  The GPS coordinates lead to the parking lot.

In a warehouse of wooden casks, the golden spirits ages and transforms, just as it has for over two and half centuries. However, the Kilbeggan Distillery was nearly lost. After a period of financial hardship it stopped production in 1954 and closed in 1957. Slowly, the building began to fall apart. It wasn’t until 1982 that the local community galvanized around the distillery, repaired the buildings and reopened it as a distillery museum. In 2007 the distillery began making whiskey again. Much of the old building and equipment has been transformed into a museum, although a small copper pot still, manufactured in the early 1800s, is still continuously used and maintained. It is the oldest working pot still in the world.  Other items seen on the tour are large mash tuns, grain mill stones, and a functional, although not in use steam engine. A small section of the museum contains maps and tools illustrating the old way of life. Snaking through the verdant landscape, the River Brosna supplies the water used in the whiskey making process. The iconic waterwheel, laden with moss, churns tirelessly (and without purpose) though it once powered the whole operation. According to local legend, alcohol isn’t only spirit dwelling within the distillery’s cool stone walls. A spiritual medium was brought in and reported that the original founder, former proprietor, and final owner were all still hanging around and were pleased that the distillery had once again begun making whiskey. Tours are offered with a guide or without, and there are various vintages to taste and compare at the end. Park in the rear of the building.

157,Cathair Crobh Dearg,"Kerry, Ireland","An important pilgrimage site for pagans and early Christians, named for a Celtic goddess-turned-saint.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathair-crobh-dearg,"Cathair Crobh Dearg (often referred to as “The City” of Shrone) is thought to be one of the oldest Christian pilgrimage sites in Ireland, having previously been an important pagan fertility site. It’s essentially a stone ráth, an ancient ring fort. Within the ráth are the possible remains of a miniature cromlech (a dolmen, or megalithic portal tomb), an ogham stone, an earthen mound, a primitive stone altar, the ruins of a 19th-century cottage, and a modern statue of “Our Lady of the Wayside.” Just outside the stone circle is a holy well which bubbles noisily when the water table is high enough. Originally used for Beltane (a Gaelic May Day festival), this pagan fertility site is named after a triple pagan war goddess Crobh Dearg (Red Claw), who later morphed into “Saint” Crobh Dearg, one of three sister saints, when the site was coopted by early Christians. There’s still an annual mass and local gathering on May Day. Throughout the year, people drink water from the holy well and others leave clooties, which are pieces of cloth ribbons common at places of Celtic pilgrimages called Clootie Wells. The stone circle is about 13 feet thick and five feet high with an entrance gap to the north and an access point to the holy well toward the southwest. The site lies south of the village of Rathmore in an area called Sliabh Luachra in County Kerry. It’s in the shadow of “the Paps of Anu,” which are considered by some to be sacred mountains. In addition to religious rituals, The City has been used for other things including testing improvised explosive devices in 1915 in preparation for the 1916 Easter Rising.  Located south of the village of Rathmore down a narrow road. If driving, park near the area beside the main information sign and allow enough room for a tractor to pass particularly during harvest time as this is an active farming area.

His style was often considered to be confrontational and unrestrained. Bacon is best known for his work depicting religious iconography and portraits of friends that were deemed emotionally charged. Like his paintings, his personal life was often erratic, fueled by alcohol and violence. Bacon died of a heart attack in 1992 at the age of 82. The studio where he worked was as chaotic as you’d expect, and it’s been preserved for visitors to come and see. After his death, the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin, Ireland, was able to obtain the entire contents of his artists’ studio at 7 Reece Mews, South Kensington, London, in 1998. The entire space was broken down into its parts. Over 7,000 articles were collected and cataloged, including everything from paintbrushes to art supplies, and even the dust! The ceiling, the walls, and the narrow staircase that led up to the studio were even taken. The massive collection was then reassembled in great detail and precision using architectural maps and photographs. After an extensive and exhaustive period of assemblage, the exact replica was opened to the public in 2001. In life, Francis Bacon had often said to friends that he would only return to Dublin “Once I am dead” and the preserved art studio to a certain extent fulfilled this premonition.  Entrance to the Hugh Lane Gallery is free. Francis Bacon's Art Studio is located at the back of the museum.

Mark Twain wrote about it in his 1869 book Innocents Abroad. When Twain asked one of the monks what would happen when he died, the monk responded, “We must all lie here at last.” And lie there they do. Some 4,000 Capuchin friars who died between 1528 and 1870 are still lying, hanging, and generally adorning the Santa Maria della Concezione crypt in Rome. In 1631, the Capuchin friars, so-called because of the “capuche” or hood attached to their religious habit, left the friary of St. Bonaventure near the Trevi Fountain and came to live at Santa Maria della Concezione, of which only the church and crypt remain. They were ordered by Cardinal Antonio Barberini (the Pope’s brother and a member of the Capuchin order) to bring the remains of the deceased friars along with them to their new home so that all the Capuchin friars might be in one place. Rather than simply burying the remains of their dead brethren, the monks decorated the walls of the crypts with their bones as a way of reminding themselves that death could come at any time. A plaque in the crypt reads, “What you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.” The ossuary contains a crypt of skulls, a crypt of leg bones, and perhaps the oddest—a “crypt of pelvises.” Mummified monks were dressed in friar’s clothes and hung from the walls and ceiling. With the addition of electricity, light fixtures were incorporated into some of the hanging monks, bringing a new meaning to the phrase “the eternal light.” A particular highlight of the crypt is the skeleton enclosed in an oval of bones holding a scythe and scales—tools made entirely out of, yes, bones. The crypt is said to have been the inspiration for Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic.

The deep crack in the rock which houses the crumbling buildings originated during a huge eruption which devastated the Mediterranean area 35.000 years ago. The flour mills, built from stone as far back as the 13th century,  took advantage of the constant stream at the bottom of the valley. They ground all the types of wheat needed by the Sorrentine people in the surrounding area. After the flour mills were successfully established, other early industrial outfits began springing up to take advantage of the waters at the bottom: a sawmill was built which furnished the chaff used by local cabinet-masters and there was a wash-house used by women for personal hygiene and laundering clothes. After the milling of flour was largely shifted to nearby pasta mills, the sunken area of industry became largely obsolete and the buildings were closed and abandoned in the 1940’s. Since their closing, the brick buildings have been slowly taken over by the aggressive greenery that thrives in the humid crevasse. The gorgeous buildings hidden in the Valley of the Mills look like nothing more than a slice of what the world will look like when humans are gone. Update: As of November 2019, the city has voted to restore the Mills, which is currently in progress.

Known as Largo di Torre Argentina, this archaeological wonder was excavated as part of Mussolini’s rebuilding efforts in 1929, revealing four Republican victory-temples that lie sunken 20 feet below modern street level.  In addition to the remains of four different temples, Torre Argentina also contains part of the famous portico of Pompey. Today, volunteers at Torre Argentina care for approximately 130 cats, many of which are disabled or suffer from illness. After the site was excavated, Rome’s feral cats moved in immediately, as they do all over the city, and the gattare, or cat ladies, began feeding and caring for them. Since the mid-1990s, the population has grown from about 90 to a peak of 250, and the organization has ramped up with care for sick or wounded cats, as well as an extensive spay and neuter program to keep the feral population in check. Most of the permanent residents have special needs—they are blind or missing legs or came from abusive homes. On any given afternoon a small crowd gathers here to watch the cats sunbathe on ancient pillars and steps. At first it may be hard to spot the cats, but once you start to see them, they are everywhere. Visitors can admire the cats and their ruins from street level, or head down the steps to the underground office to volunteer, peruse the gift shop, donate, and even adopt cats. There is another Roman cat sanctuary located at the Protestant Cemetery, near the Pyramid of Cestius.  Entrance at Largo di Torre Argentina, corner of Via Florida & Via di Torre Argentina.

Commissioned in 1552 by Prince Pier Francesco Orsini, it was an expression of grief designed to shock. The Prince, also known as Vicino, had just been through a brutal war, had his friend killed, been held for ransom for years, and come home only to have his beloved wife die. Racked with grief, the Prince wanted to create a shocking “Villa of Wonders” and hired architect Pirro Ligorio to help him do so. Ligorio was a widely respected architect and artist and had previously completed the Cathedral of Saint Peter in Rome after the death of Michelangelo, as well as the Villa d’Este in Tivoli. This was to be an unusual, but interesting job for him. The park is filed with bizarre and fascinating sculptures for which only the accompanying inscriptions provide any explanation. Among the pieces are a war elephant, a monstrous fish-head, a giant tearing another giant in half, and a house built on a tilt to disorient the viewer. Perhaps the most frightening piece in the garden is an enormous head, mouth opened wide in a scream. The accompanying inscription reads “all reason departs.” Built during the Italian Renaissance, the garden layout bore little resemblance to the symmetry of other Renaissance gardens, and the art was made in a rough “Mannerist” style, a sort of 16th-century version of Surrealism. It makes sense, then, that the Surrealists loved it. Salvador Dalí visited the park and loved it. He was so inspired, he shot a short film there, and the sculptures inspired his 1946 painting The Temptation of Saint Anthony. Jean Cocteau was also a fan of the park. Other artists followed, and a novel, libretto, and opera have all been based on the park. While there is no way of truly knowing how the Prince felt about the park, the final addition indicates that perhaps he was getting over his melancholy. Built 20 years after the park was begun, it is not a monster but a temple, built to honor his second wife. When you visit the park, be sure to enter the giant screaming mouth (known as “the mouth of hell”), inside which, on the tongue, stands a picnic table and enough seating for a small group to have lunch.",ao loves halloween 2022 monsters outsider architecture outsider art sculptures statues

The self-proclaimed “most beautiful bookstore in the world” is composed of a number of over-stuffed rooms stacked wall-to-wall with books, magazines, maps, and other ephemera. Due to Venice’s constant flooding, however, these picturesque piles are all placed inside bathtubs, waterproof bins, and in one room a full-size gondola. The name itself even means “Book Store of High Water.” When the local waterways rise to fill the store, the water can rise inches off the floor, which would destroy any other collection. The store’s whimsically cramped atmosphere is even reflected in their “fire escape,” which is simply a door leading directly out into a canal. To really complete the look, the store has become home to more than one stray cat, who are also able to escape the rising tides by hanging out atop the stacks.",bookstores shops
165,Quartiere Coppedè,"Rome, Italy",Architectureal fantasy quarter of Rome.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quartiere-copped,"Quartiere Coppedè is an unexpected and bizarre area in Rome, nestled within the Trieste district in the northern part of the city. The fantastical mix of Ancient Greek, Roman Baroque, Mannerist, Medieval, and, overall, Art Nouveau mishmash was brought to life by Florentine architect Gino Coppedè (from whom the quarter itself takes its current name) in 1919. Coppedè worked on the quarter until his death in 1927. Though the Art Nouveau palaces of Quartiere Coppedè, featuring floral, mythological and medieval details, are abundant, there is plenty of space for the fantasies of Coppedè in this vast area. “The 31,000 square meters of the quarter (with some 40 structures) are alive with Florentine towers and Venetian palazzi decorated with external mosaics and frescoes, Baroque Roman palazzi with real and imitation papal stemmata, a sundial, and even a building devoted to a musical decorative scheme whose exterior ironwork and carvings imitate musical notation” (Source). Thanks to its strange beauty, the Quartiere Coppedè has been used as the setting for a number of films, and is a fun way to leave the beaten path of Rome. You can reach Quartiere Coppedè by taking Tram 3 or 19 to Piazza Buenos Aires, which is a short walk to Piazza Mincio. While you're there, be sure to stop by Piazzo Mincio and check out the whimsical Fontana delle Rane (Fountain of Frogs), in which the Beatles famously dunked themselves after a concert in Rome. Also check out the archway over Via Tagliamento, which marks the entrance to the quarter and is where you'll find Quartiere Coppedè's whimsical outdoor chandelier, positioned over the road.",outsider architecture eccentric homes homes architectural oddities architecture

Its gorgeous frescoes and brilliant colors are a feast for the eyes and a welcome change from the pale, faded ancient Roman ruins scattered throughout the city. The opulent courtyard was built in the late 19th century for the wealthy, influential Sciarra family. It was meant to be a shopping mall, which, had the mall come to fruition, would perhaps be one of the most beautiful shopping centers in Rome. Every inch of the four-story walls enclosing the space is covered by colorful frescoes of women and men surrounded by elegant, curling floral designs. The women are the main focus, as the gorgeous artwork, which was painted by Giuseppe Cellini, is intended to celebrate women in the various phases of life. The glass and iron ceiling lets sunlight spill into the courtyard, illuminating the details in the frescoes. When the sun goes down, lights turn on to bathe the courtyard in a warm yellow glow.",art nouveau 19th century hidden architecture

A prominent resort city for centuries, Baia catered to the recreational whims of the rich and powerful among the Roman elite. The city, which was located over natural volcanic vents, was famous for its healing medicinal hot springs which occurred all around the city and were quite easy to build spas over. Some of antiquity’s most powerful figures such as Nero, Cicero, and Caesar were known to have visited the city and a number of them actually built permanent vacation villas there. Unfortunately, the good times were not to last and the city was sacked by a Muslim army in the 8th century. By 1500, the remains of the formerly luxurious town were abandoned. After the city remains were emptied, the water level slowly rose due to the same volcanic vents that were once a draw to the area, and most of the ancient ruins were drowned under the shallow waters of the bay. Today the ancient remains of Baia can be visited in one of the world’s few underwater archeological parks. Visitors can view the crumbled structures and amazingly preserved statuary of the city through glass-bottomed boats, snorkeling, or even scuba dives which allow people to actually swim amongst the copious ruins. While the city is no longer a resort, its waters still hold wonders.",underwater week underwater archaeology statues ruins
168,The Dome Illusion,"Rome, Italy","A master of trompe-l'oeil creates a stunning, tourist-fooling dome out of a flat ceiling.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dome-illusion,"The Jesuit church of Saint Ignazio was supposed to have a glorious dome, but when the money ran out in 1642, the plans were scrapped. Instead of forgoing the dome entirely, painter and Jesuit brother Andrea Pozzo proposed that he paint a life-sized illusion of a dome that would fool the eyes of visitors (as long as they looked up from the proper angle). His masterpiece, painted between 1685 and 1694, still deceives the eye today. Pozzo painted another illusion for the barrel-vaunted ceiling of Saint Ignazio. The huge painting depicting the life and works of Saint Ignatius lifts and expands the simple building skyward, using forced perspective to move the figures up into the heights. The technique is known as quadratura, a mixture of geometrically accurate architecture in forced perspective and elements of fantasy, like cherubs and floating saints. Pozzo wrote a book on the subject, Perspectiva Pictorum et Architectorum, which was very influential with other Baroque painters. Both the dome and the central illustration are painted on a single 17 meter canvas. His work on the illusions was so well received that he was granted the commission for the rest of the artwork in the church. In April of 1891 an enormous powder magazine explosion just outside the city rocked Rome and damaged the ceiling artwork. (It also collapsed part of the roof of the Parliament building and sent the city into a general panic.) A restoration in 1961 repaired the painted ceiling. In 1703, Pozzo repeated his dome illusion in Vienna, in a Jesuit church now called the University Church, and at the Church of the Gesù in Frascati, Italy.  The entrance to the church faces Piazza S. Ignazio. The best way to view the illusion is to enter the church keeping your eyes low until you reach the circular marble marker that indicates the ideal vantage point for taking in the “dome.” A second marker on the floor indicates the ideal viewing spot for the rest of the ceiling.",optical oddities domes architectural oddities architecture

The doorway in question leads to the Priory of the Knights of Malta, the legendary crusader knights and religious order. Although the property has been in their hands for centuries, the site has seen many occupants. It originally held a fortified palace belonging to Alberico II, the ruler of Rome from 932-954, then became a Benedictine monastery before passing first into the hands of the Knights Templar in the 1100s, then finally to their brothers in arms, the Knights of Malta, in the 1400s.  As it holds extraterritorial status, it is not technically “Italy” within the walls. The elegant building seen today is a small church known as Santa Maria del Priorato. It is the 18th-century handiwork of the famous architect and engraver Giovanni Battista Piranesi, also known for his romantic etchings depicting the city and for his dark and enigmatic series of imaginary prisons (Carceri d’Invenzione). The church’s architectural motifs evoke ships and the sea, inspired by the longstanding tradition of comparing the Aventine Hill to a ship. The design also incorporates many esoteric and Masonic symbols. Piranesi was buried at the Priory after his death in 1778. The estate also houses the Embassy of the Order of Malta to Italy. The keyhole vista lines up perfectly with the garden, centered on the Vatican in the distance. No one seems to be able to say with certainty whether this was a beautifully planned peepshow—or just a lucky coincidence.  At the intersection of via di S.

170,Porta Alchemica,"Rome, Italy","An alchemist's ""magic door"" stands in the middle of a Roman park.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/porta-magica,"While this “magic door” is famous to Romans, it is barely noticed by tourists visiting Rome. But in the central district of Piazza Vittorio, inside the park, the remains of an old villa reveal a Magic or Alchemist Door, a portal into the real and secretive world of 1600s alchemy. Full of symbols and inscriptions, it was built during the early 1600s by the Roman marquis Massimiliano Palombara, a member of a group of people known as “The Alchemists of Palazzo Riario” who congregated around the Roman court of Christina, the Queen Regent of Sweden. Christina was an ardent supporter of alchemy and science, and thinkers and science luminaries like Rene Descartes and Athanasius Kircher were often found in her Italian court along with alchemy enthusiasts like Palombara. The Porta Alchemica is the only remaining of five doors to Palombara’s villa. According to legend, the Marquis met an alchemist at a dinner party who told him he could use a certain herb to turn metals to gold. In the morning the alchemist (said to be Giuseppe Francesco Borri, a sort of alchemical Zelig) was gone but had left behind some gold flakes, evidence apparently of his successful transformations, and an indecipherable sheet, the “recipe” for the transformation. Because the Marquis was unable to read it he inscribed the recipe on his doors in the hope that someone who could understand it would see it and come knocking. Mystery and occult beliefs still surround the door, and a cryptic symbol above the doorway fuels many of these theories. But of course, to most visitors to Rome, it’s just another mysterious ruin. Update as of November 2019: The park is currently under construction and inaccessible. Update as of January 2020: Still under construction and inaccessible.

171,The Mouth of Truth,"Rome, Italy",The yawning maw of this pagan visage is said to bite off the hands of liars.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mouth-of-truth-rome-italy,"Long before the modern lie detector and its harmlessly jittering graphs and wires were invented, the superstitious and untruthful faced a much more severe fate between the jaws of the Bocca della Verità, or Mouth of Truth, an ancient carving which is said to bite the hands off of liars. While no one is exactly sure when or why the frieze was created, there are a number of theories. Dating back to around the 1st century CE, the Mouth of Truth is a tall stone disc carved into a humanoid face with hollow holes for eyes and its gaping mouth. The original purpose of the large medallion has been theorized as everything from a ceremonial well cover, to a piece of fountain decoration, to a manhole cover. The face itself has been said to represent a pagan god although exactly which one is up for debate with scholars guessing at everyone from forest god Faunus, to sea god Oceanus, to a local river god. While the origin is up for debate the one unifying legend surrounding the stone carving is that if one were to stick their hand inside the disc’s mouth and tell a lie, the rocky maw would bite the offending hand off. This belief seems to have originated during the Middle Ages when the disc was supposedly used during trials having the accused put their hand in the slot and if found to be untruthful a hidden axeman would lop off the appendage. While this use seems to be apocryphal, the superstition persists to this day. The Mouth of Truth, which now rests outside the doors of the Basilica di Santa Maria in Cosmedin, has been used as a whimsical lie detector in a number of movies and video games, most famously in the 1953 romance, Roman Holiday, in which the carving was a major plot device.  You can choose your own attire to visit The Mouth of Truth, but if you decide to enter the church and see St. Valentine's Skull, you'll want to make sure your shoulders and knees are covered. If not, you'll wear a plastic tarp over your shoulders or be denied entrance.",legends sculptures

While Venice can take on a melancholy feel, Burano’s cheery and brightly painted houses stand out. Burano is made up of a group of four small islands linked together by a series of bridges and held together even more solidly by their colorful painting trend. The eye-catching color scheme has been upheld for decades and was even beginning to fade until recent years when the practice was reinstated. Now, Burano’s houses pop with bright colors that almost look photoshopped as the homes are repainted every two years. Each house is painted a different color from its neighbors and in fact, anyone that wants to paint their place needs to get approval from the local community government first. In addition to its uniquely painted houses, Burano is renowned for its quality lacework and even boasts a Museum of Lace, although photography is prohibited on the premises. The Museum of Lace may be the only place in the little neighborhood where photography is outlawed as groups of visiting photographers are a regular sight on the streets of this tiny albeit colorful island.  To get to Burano, you'll have to take the Vaporetto (number 12) from the Fondament Nove in Venice.

173,Galileo's Middle Finger,"Florence, Italy",The middle finger of modernity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/galileos-middle-finger,"It is a remarkable bit of irony, the finger: venerated, kept in a shrine, subjected to the same treatment as a saintly relic. But this finger belonged to no saint. It is the long bony finger of an enemy of the church, a heretic. As with a fine wine, it took some years for Galileo’s finger to age into something worth snapping off his skeletal hand. The finger was removed by one Anton Francesco Gori on March 12, 1737, 95 years after Galileo’s death. Passed around for a couple hundred years it finally came to rest in the Florence History of Science Museum, which has since become the Galileo Museum. In 2009 two more fingers and a tooth belonging to Galileo were discovered at an auction. The spare parts had disappeared in 1905, not seen for 100 years. But then the purchaser was able to deduce their origin, and has returned them to the Science Museum where they match a detailed description from when they were last seen. Today the middle finger sits in a small glass egg among lodestones and telescopes, the only human fragment in a museum devoted entirely to scientific instruments. It is hard to know how Galileo would have felt about the final resting place of his finger. Whether the finger points upwards to the sky, where Galileo glimpsed the glory of the universe and saw God in mathematics, or if it sits eternally defiant to the church that condemned him, is for the viewer to decide. Galileo’s middle finger has since been joined by his index finger, thumb, and tooth enclosed in a bell jar.",galileo relics relics and reliquaries
174,The Mithraeum at Circus Maximus,"Rome, Italy",The underground sanctuary of a mysterious ancient cult.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mithraeum-at-circus-maximus-rome-italy,"One of the largest secret Mithraic temples in Rome is hidden next to the famous Circus Maximus. Discovered in 1931 as part of Rome’s fascist-era building projects, the small subterranean space was once dedicated to the mystery cult of the god Mithras. Although several mithraeums have been discovered throughout the ancient holding of the Roman Empire, including sites in London, and several in Germany, France, and Hungary, little is known about the actual religious practices of the movement’s followers. The Mithraic Mysteries emerged and gained popularity throughout Rome between the 1st and 4th centuries. The cult and religious sanctuaries were open only to initiates, and their rituals secret. The central imagery is of the god Mithras slaying a bull, a motif known as “tauroctony,” found in most if not all mithraeums. Some trace the origins of the cult to the Iranian god Mitra, based on statements made by 3-4th century AD philosopher Porphyry, but some question whether he actually knew what he was talking about. In any event, the cult died out at the end of 4th century as Christianity began to gain momentum. Mithraeums were often underground, sometimes built into natural caves. The central chamber was dark and windowless, in contrast to the open and bright structure of most early Roman temples. The structures are small and intimate, designed to hold only 30-40 people as a place of secret ritual prayer, sacrifice, and ritual meals of bread and wine. The mithraeum under Circus Maximus is accessible by appointment only. The site dates to the 2nd century AD, and features five parallel but separate chambers with a central sanctuary paved in white marble, with two niches for statues of Caute and Cautopates, and a place of honor which would have held a statue of Mithras.",mithras ancient cults cults long now locations subterranean subterranean sites sacred spaces
175,Pyramid of Cestius,"Rome, Italy","The only ""Egyptian"" pyramid in Europe and the legendary tomb of Remus.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-of-cestius,"Egyptomania gripped Rome in the wake of the conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. Both massive original artifacts and inspired copies cropped up all over the city, but only two actual pyramids were known to have been built, and only one remains. The Pyramid of Cestius was most likely built between 18 and 12 BC. The 36 meter (about 120 feet) high pyramid was built as a tomb for a wealthy Roman under the sway of all things Egyptian. Little is known about the man who may have once been buried here, since the tomb was long ago ransacked and the land around it has changed dramatically over the centuries. Now at the edge of a busy traffic intersection near a major train stop, originally the pyramid was well outside of the center of the city, surrounded by stately columns and two bronze figures (now in the Musei Capitolini). The pyramid rises at a much sharper angle than the famous pyramids in Egypt. This may have been due to incorrect information on the Egyptian front, innovation on the part of the Roman builders who, using concrete as a building material, were able to more steeply, or they may have been inspired by the steeper Nubian pyramids near Jebel Barkal, now in Sudan. In any event, the unusual proportions of this pyramid close to home has been credited as the source of oddly proportioned pyramids in European art supposedly depicting the Egyptian originals. During this craze for all things Egyptian the famous obelisks began to appear in the city. Two of them dating from this period still stand - one in the Piazza del Popolo, and the second in the Piazza di Montecitorio (though neither one stands in its original location). In addition to obelisks and other Egyptian imports there was actually another, larger pyramid in Rome, known as the “Pyramid of Romulus” near the Castel Sant’Angelo. This pyramid did not survive the building crazes of later generations, and its marble was used in the building of the stairs at St. Peter’s Basilica. The Pyramid of Cestius is constructed of brick and cement, covered in white marble. Originally the interior of his tomb was decorated with lively frescoes, described in detail by early travelers, but now mostly gone. Between 271 and 275 it was built into the fortifications of the Aurelian walls, which likely helped it survive the centuries. The inscription on the southeast side of the pyramid reads: “Gaius Cestius Epulo, son of Lucius, of the Poblilian district, praetor, tribune of the people, official of the public banquets. According to his will, this work was completed in three hundred and thirty days; it was executed by his heirs L. Pontus Mela, son of Publius, of the Claudian district, and his freedman Pothus” By the middle ages, stories about the two pyramids named them as the tombs of the legendary founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus. The actual tomb and inscriptions were not (re)discovered until tunnel builders found it in the 1600s. It was restored first in the 1600s, later in 1999, and again in 2015. It is the only pyramid of its kind in Europe. Today the tomb can only be accessed by special permission. For a view of the pyramid with less traffic, go inside the Aurelian walls to the Protestant Cemetery to the northwest side.

176,Michelangelo's Hidden Drawings,"Florence, Italy",The doodles of a genius line the walls of a secret room under the Medici Chapel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/michelangelos-hidden-drawings,"In 1530, to escape the wrath of the Pope, Michelangelo holed up in a tiny secret room under the Medici Chapel of the Basilica di San Lorenzo. The artist had been working on the lavish tomb when all hell broke loose in Florence, and he was forced into hiding. With nothing but time and a little charcoal on his hands, he covered the bare walls with some prisoner graffiti. Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni designed the Medici Chapel as an elaborate domed mausoleum for his patron family, but for three months he hid underneath it and filled the walls with drawings—of himself, of Christ, and even, some experts believe, sketched reproductions of images from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which he had completed in 1512. Michelangelo owed his career to the Medici, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Europe. In 1529 he joined ranks with other Florentines who had grown weary of their rule, hoping for a more democratic system of governance. Defying the formidable family, let alone the Pope (Clement VII, who was a Medici), was more than a little counterintuitive for the artist, whose livelihood depended on them. But defy he did, working to help fortify the city walls against Medici-friendly forces led by the Pope himself. After ten months of struggle the Pope and his family won, and the republican sympathizers were swiftly punished. This would have included Michelangelo, had he not retreated for those three months to his subterranean hideaway to wait it out. In November of 1530, after the Pope let it be known that Michelangelo could go back to work—unpunished–to complete the Chapel, he reemerged. All was forgiven between the artist and his patrons, eager to finally have their finished tomb. Michelangelo never let on where he had been, and for almost 500 years his whereabouts remained a secret. During this time, some believed he had been staying with a friend or in a church bell tower. The room and the drawings weren’t discovered until 1976, when they were stumbled upon by the director of the Museum of the Medici Chapel. Since then, given its fragility, the tiny, dark and unvented space has been alternately opened and closed to the public. Imagine spending three months down there with nothing but doodling to keep you occupied. The Chapel is part of the Basilica di San Lorenzo in the center of Florence, open from 8:15am to 5pm every day except as follows: closed on the 2nd and 4th Sunday of each month, and on the 1st, 3rd and 5th Monday. Admission is €8 for adults, €4 for kids, seniors and students - and the first Sunday of every month is free. As it turns out, it’s not healthy for the drawings to have too many tourists breathing on them, so the secret room is currently officially closed to the public. They do make occasional exceptions, so it's worth a try to ask around when you're there - you may get lucky. If not, according to florencewebguide.com, you can see additional drawings and sketches attributed to Michelangelo behind the Chapel altar.",secret museums secret passages renaissance graffiti prisons art

It was established in 1221, when the Dominican monks from the adjacent Basilica of Santa Maria Novella began growing herbs to make balms, salves and medicines for their infirmary. The superior quality of their products became widely known, and in the 17th century, the pharmacy opened its doors to the public. Today the pharmacy still uses the traditional preparation methods, and still carries products using the original recipes of the monks. Especially of note is the Aceto dei Sette Ladri, or “Seven Thieves Vinegar.” These smelling salts got their unusual name from a band of seven men who robbed corpses during the plague. They were said to have doused themselves in the strong vinegar to protect themselves from the plague (bad smells, or “miasma,” were believed to be the cause of illness.) Another specialty of the pharmacy is their production of Carta D’Armenia (“Armenian Paper”) since at least the 16th century. It’s a paper incense which is soaked in a mixture of infusions of resins and oriental spices, and burns without a flame, scenting the air. The pharmacy itself is housed in the extraordinary original building, the rooms of which are complete with vaulted ceilings, ornate gilding, frescoes, walnut cabinetry, glass-stoppered decanters full of colorful potions, marble floors, glass-stained windows, bronze statues, and antique apothecary scales and mortars. There is also a small museum, with somewhat irregular hours, which features antique terra-cotta apothecary jars, however the best antiques are already on display in the shop itself. The staff are able to answer questions and provide suggestions based on your preferences.  There are product lists in a wide variety of languages, and a large computerized display allows customers to explore the offerings and read the history of each product. They will want to educate you one by one on each scent of cologne, with all the different subtle notes, like wine.  The soaps are easier to view and smell; the violet soap is a particular treat.  The prices are very high but so is the quality.  It’s worth a visit to see the interior alone–it was a former papal residence and is ornate and lovely.  It looks like nothing on the outside.

In reality, it is one of the longest and oldest roads built by the Roman empire and neatly encapsulates much of the great history of Rome. Above ground, the Appian Way is one of the marvels of the Roman Empire. Stretching 560 kilometers from Rome to Brindisi, Via Appia was built in 312 B.C.E, and conceived and named for the wealthy and politically powerful Appius Claudius Caecus. Originally, the road was meant to bring armies and supplies across the empire, but its use expanded quickly after its construction. In the Roman tradition, bodies may not be buried in the city. Instead, tombs are built on the outskirts, and many wealthy Romans were buried right alongside the Via Appia. Today, many ostentatious and stunning tombs exist just off the road. Besides the sites along the way, the road itself is a stunning work. Perfectly cobbled and fitted with stones, the road exists as it did 2300 years ago, and the stones are allegedly so fitted, a knife must be used to pry them apart. After Christianity took hold in Rome, the road took on a new life as well. Catacombs were built beneath much of the road, and bodies given Christian burials were placed in them. According to legend, St. Peter also met Jesus along the road while he was fleeing Rome. Amazingly, the road has remained true to form after all its years. Part of the road in Rome is now a park, but the majority of the Via Appia can still be walked.",ruins

He sits atop a grotto in apparent anguish at his fate. Although most of the park and villa was completed in the 16th century, it was all but abandoned in the early 1800s, and some of its delicate statues were actually removed and taken to another Italian garden. Slowly being consumed by nature, the gardens were finally rescued by Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who was so struck by their natural beauty of the place, that he decided to destroy the ruins of the villa and focus completely on the gardens themselves.

Lettering painted across the forehead identify the owner as none other than of the patron saint of lovers, St. Valentine. Knowing just exactly whose skull it is, though, is complicated. There was more than one Catholic saint known as Saint Valentine, and there was approximately 1500 years between those martyrs’ deaths and the enthusiastic distribution and labeling of bodies in the Victorian era. Finally, and most troubling, there is the fact that no less than 10 places around the world claim to house the saint’s relics. Though not much is really known of the real men behind the myth, at least two of the Saints Valentine lived in Italy in the late 3rd century, and another in North Africa around the same time. Over time, the stories of these different men seem to have merged. Most of the mythology about Valentine centers around him being a patron of lovers. In 496, Pope Gelasius I made February 14—originally part of the Roman festival of Lupercalia—a feast day dedicated to St. Valentine. The Basilica di Santa Maria in Cosmedin itself is very old, standing on the site of an ancient Roman temple that dates to the second century B.C. Most of what you see today dates to the 8th and 12th centuries, including the crypt located beneath the altar. The skull can be found in the side altar on the left side of the church. While you’re there, stop by the portico to visit with the famous Bocca della Verità (mouth of truth).  Metro: Circo Massimo. This church entrance is located directly to the right of the Mouth of Truth and as with any church there, it's important for your shoulders and knees to be covered. If not, they'll place a plastic tarp over your shoulders or they will not let you gain entrance. There's a gift shop here where you can purchase miniature versions of the Mouth of Truth. To access it, you go to the Mouth of Truth, into the church, and out through the other doors.

182,Buontalenti Grotta,"Florence, Italy",A large grotto built in the 16th century amidst Florence's famous Boboli gardens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-buontalenti-grotto-florence-italy,"The biggest of the three grottoes - along with the Mose Grotto and the 19th-century Adam and Eve Grotto - in the area, Buontalenti roughly translates to, as one might suspect, large grotto. But that’s just regional slang, something that has come into effect over the last four hundred or so years. Buontalenti is actually the last name of Bernardo, the architect who realized the structure sometime between 1583 and 1593. Placed in the Boboli Gardens in Florence, giving tourists a lot more than just a cave to look at, the Buontalenti Grotto was commissioned by Francesco I de’ Medici in order to complete the previous Vasari project, a complicated plan to create a huge nursery garden which was left unfinished. On both sides of the pillared entrance to the Buontalenti Grotto there are two niches with sculptures representing Ceres and Apollo. Both crafted by Baccio Bandinelli, the pieces were originally part of Vasari’s nursery. Gorgeous though they are, the two sculptures are hardly the most impressive or eye-catching piece of the structure. The facade is completely overlaid with concretions similar to stalagmites. The tympanum is displayed in the center and the Medici coat of arms is supported by two mosaic feminine figures symbolizing Peace and Justice. The background of the facade, on which all of this sits, is decorated by mosaic frames containing sea goats and other mythical designs. Once inside, visitors notice that the Buontalenti Grotto is divided into three communicating rooms. The first, bigger than the other two, has walls decorated with fake stalactites and stalagmites, sponges, stones, and shells that are laid out to resemble anthropomorphic figures. Carved by Pietro Mati, these designs are meant to resemble a natural grotto - with a twist. Here, in the main room of the Grotto, is a hole in the center of the ceiling where a fishpond was once set. (Before the restoration, the entire place was filled with waterworks, including sluices, which forces the water to create iridescent shimmers on the walls.) The hole is set in the center of ceiling frescoes that represent an arbor with wild animals and satyrs designed by Bernardino Poccetti. The second room is decorated in much the same way as the first, with frescoes that show Minerva and Giunone. The designs frame two niches. The third room also has niches and frescoes, but has an additional element that helps it to stand out: a green marble fountain. The ceiling in this room, the third, resembles a sky with flying birds.",follies and grottoes architectural oddities architecture

According to the traditions of the Ladin people in Italy’s South Tyrol region, once upon a time, a beautiful water nymph called the pristine waters of Lake Carezza, at the foot of the Dolomites, home. One day, while braiding her hair on its shores, the sorcerer Masaré was overcome by the sound of the nymph as she softly sang to herself. Head over heels in love, he sought the help of a witch to make the nymph his own. An elaborate plan involving a disguise as a jewelry salesman, and casting a rainbow across the lake ensued. Unfortunately for the sorcerer, he forgot to wear his jewelry salesman outfit and was discovered by the nymph even as she marvelled at his creation. Evading his trap, she hasn’t been seen since. Completely distraught at his own foolishness, Masaré smashed the rainbow into a million pieces, which fell into the lake’s waters below. Their fractured magnificence continues to radiate through its crystalline waters to this day, and account for Carezza’s other name: Lec de ergobando, or “Rainbow Lake.”  To get to the lake head south on the main N241 and the lake is on your left.",witchcraft lakes legends natural wonders water nature
184,The Flooded Crypt of San Zaccaria,"Venice, Italy","As can be expected from a centuries old church built in a canal city, the undercroft of this house of worship is beautifully flooded.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-flooded-crypt-of-san-zaccaria-venice-italy,"Established in the 15th century using a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance styles that reflect the transitional times, Venice’s San Zaccaria church is a beautifully ornate church whose crypt has filled with the ubiquitous waters of the surrounding canals. There has actually been a church on the site since the 9th century when it was created by one of the local leaders (known as a doge) of the time. It was not until centuries later that the current architectural jewel was built on the site but the crypt is mainly populated by the bodies of the doges from the church’s initial tenure. The lovely burial basement features the columns and vaulted ceilings indicative of the times, but like many buildings in Venice this subterranean level is partially filled with a permanent level of standing water. However, rather than destroying the funereal beauty of the site, it tends to enhance it by acting as a sort of mirror pool, making the columns look almost twice as long and setting the tombs off from the dry portions of the floor, giving them an even more sacred feel. While most visitors to San Zaccaria focus on the ornate decoration of the main hall and facade, it is the crypt that truly set this place of worship apart from the rest of the pack. Enter the Church of San Zaccaria via the Campo San Zaccaria, veer to the right, and wait patiently for the docent to reappear at the desk to the right.

The graveyard, filling with bodies from the new hospital, soon proved insufficient. Not long after, in 1210, a little chamber was built to collect the bones from the hospital, and, in 1269, another small church was constructed near the bone chamber. (And in 1738, King John V of Portugal was so affected by the sight of the Chapel that he decided to built an exact copy of it in Evora, near Lisbon.) Today, the ossuary at San Bernardino alle Ossa is located at the end of a short corridor to the the right of the church’s entrance. The vault is decorated with frescos from Sebastiano Ricci, dating from 1695. The building’s walls are completely covered in bones and skulls, some from the old ossuary, some from other local graveyards; they also decorate the doors and the pillars. Some have speculated that the bones belonged to martyrs killed by heretics in St. Ambros’ time. The bones, however, mostly seem to have come from the patients of the ancient Ospedale del Brolo (the local hospital), from monks that operated the hospital, and from people who died in prison.

186,Neptune's Grotto,"Alghero, Italy",Stalactites and stalagmites in a beautifully lit cave.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/neptune-s-grotto,"In the 18th century, a local fisherman from Sardinia spotted an opening in a cliff side while fishing off the coast. The opening, which is generally a meter above sea level unless waters are rough, turned out to be a beautiful grotto featuring an abundance of giant stalactites and stalagmites. Named after the Roman god of the sea, the local legend has since become a tourist attraction. Within the grotto, tourists can visit a 120-meter-long saltwater lake. The shallow salt lake boasts the same calcic salt structures as the rest of the cave. The entrance to the cave is accessible by boat when waters are calm, or by car. Those driving to the site park atop the cliff and then climb down steps that were made in 1954 known as escala del cabirol, or “goat steps.” The passageways within the cliffs are approximately two and a half miles long, although only the first few hundred meters are open to the public.",subterranean sites geological oddities caves ecosystems geology

Because Rome has always attracted visitors from all over the world, and many of them have been artists and scholars searching for the signs of Roman history, this ancient, park-like section of the cemetery contains a number of artists’ graves, in particular those of the great Romantic poets John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley. The modern, more crowded section accommodates thousands of graves of famous and less-famous people, among whom Communist leader Antonio Gramsci, writer Carlo Emilio Gadda, physicist Bruno Pontecorvo. The cemetery is one of the oldest burial grounds in continuous use in Europe (the earliest burial dates back to 1738) and is packed with history and beautiful monuments. It is also, along with the enclosure of the nearby pyramid, home to one of Rome’s famous semi-feral cat colonies, tended by volunteers. Another Roman cat sanctuary is located at Torre Argentina.

On the Oppian Hill, where the homes of Rome’s elite used to stand, the mad emperor Nero built himself a gigantic palace known as the Domus Aurea, or Golden House. Despite the extravagant detail he insisted on, Nero never lived in the Domus Aurea full time; the house was strictly for pleasure. And what pleasure there was! Walls inlaid with ivory, acres of the finest marble, artificial lakes, mosaics spreading over the ceilings, and possibly most amazing for the time, a revolving dining-room ceiling that dropped perfume and rose petals on reveling guests, were all located on the grounds. “At last,” Suetonius has Nero say, upon moving in, “I am beginning to live like a human being.” The Golden House was shunned and despised by Nero’s successors who saw the site as a symbol of the waste and hubris of Nero. In the years after his death the Domus Aurea was swiftly buried beneath further construction. Paradoxically, it was this speedy burial that led to the site’s preservation. Buried under shame and centuries of construction, the pleasure dome lay undiscovered until the 15th century, when a young man fell through a crack in the hillside and found himself in the echoing chambers of Nero’s abandoned palace. Soon, the greatest artists of the Renaissance, Michelangelo and Raphael, were lowering themselves down carefully into the ruins of the Golden House, creeping through its halls and chambers, and memorizing every detail of its intricate frescoes. Once discovered, the Golden House could not endure in its pristine condition for long. Damp and rot attacked the delicate paintings, and careless visitors (including Casanova and the Marquis de Sade) scratched their names on the walls. Rains eventually led to the collapse of ceilings and vaults and the once-bright frescoes faded to muddy outlines.  The Domus Aurea is open for tours only on weekends, available through Italy's Coop Culture website, as it is still an active archeological site. Directions for finding the entrance are sorely wanting, and many visitors have wandered the Colle Oppio park, lost in the shadows of the Colosseum and other ancient ruins. To avoid getting lost, enter the park at Via Labicana and Via Nicola Salvi, across the street from the Colosseum, and don't trust Google Maps, which will put you at the back of the ruins and force you to navigate the park in search of the entrance.",palaces ancient archaeology ruins

Buried a few days after Pompeii, the small but wealthy village of Herculaneum, on the north side of the volcano, had more time to panic and evacuate than its more famous neighboring city. The eruption eventually covered the town in up to 60 feet of ash and mud, making the excavations of the site labor intensive and complicated, but safekeeping the ancient city in a remarkable state of preservation. Even wood was preserved at Herculaneum. The ruins of the city were first uncovered in 1738 under Spaniard Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre, and excavations and active research continue today. The ruins are best known for the extraordinary beauty of some of the preserved frescoes and mosaics decorating the fine homes, as well as the fact that the first intact Roman skeletons discovered for study were found here. Over 300 sets of human remains have been uncovered at Herculaneum. Most of the skeletons discovered showed signs of hard labor at some point in their lives. The researchers later determined that at least 80 percent of the skeletons uncovered had been a slave at some period of time. Of particular note is the Villa dei Papyri, once home to a massive library and named for the treasure trove of Roman manuscripts discovered and saved from the ruins between 1752 and 1754. The Herculaneum papyri are now stored at the National Library in Naples, the French National Academy in Paris, the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and the British Library in London. The Getty Villa in Los Angeles is modeled on the Villa dei Papyri. Today the archaeological site sits tucked in—and partially under—the modern city of Ercolano.",disaster areas volcanoes ancient geology ruins

Through the doors of the Capuchin Monastery, which looks like any other building from the outside, visitors can descend into the large Capuchin catacombs. Pinned to the walls, sitting on benches and shelves and tucked away in open coffins are nearly 8,000 corpses, each one dressed in their Sunday best. In most of Western culture, the long-dead are generally kept out of sight, hidden from the living. Here, it is the exception. Nothing stands between the living and dead, except maybe a rope with a sign asking visitors to be respectful. The ill-lit, musty catacombs have been separated into a few corridors, each one hosting a specific type of person. There is a room for religious figures, mainly those affiliated with the monastery, for professionals, such as doctors, and a room for women, virgins and infants. The oldest corpse in the macabre collection is that of Silvestro da Gubbio, a friar who passed in 1599. It is believed that the particularly dry atmosphere allowed for the natural mummification of the bodies. Initially, priests would lay the dead on shelves and allow them to drip until they were completely depleted of bodily fluids. A full year later, the dried-out corpse would be rinsed with vinegar before being re-dressed in their best attire and sent to their proper room, to stand for eternity. One of the most recent to be interred was Rosalia Lombardo, only two years old when she was embalmed in 1920. The embalming procedure has kept Rosalia looking so well preserved that she has been dubbed “Sleeping Beauty.” The embalming procedure, which was lost for decades, consists of “formalin to kill bacteria, alcohol to dry the body, glycerin to keep her from overdrying, salicylic acid to kill fungi, and the most important ingredient, zinc salts to give the body rigidity.”  Admission: The ticket price is € 3,00.

But perhaps the most unusual, hilarious, and quirky building is Zuccari Palace, AKA The Monster House. This “Monster House” is so called from one facade of the building, which features large monster faces with their mouths gaping wide, in the process of swallowing the doors and windows. This palace was built by the famous Baroque artist Federico Zuccari in 1590 as a studio for himself and his children. For the facade facing Via Gregoriana, Zuccari drew inspiration from the Gardens of Bomarzo, located in northern Lazio, Italy. The architectural style of the building, both praised and criticized, soon became the hot spot for aspiring artisans in the area. After Zuccari’s death, the building changed hands many times. The Queen of Poland lived here in 1702 and for decades the house was a center of high society in Rome. Later on, the palace became an inn for foreign artists. In 1900, Henrietta Hertz, the last owner, left her collection of paintings to the Italian state, allowing the creation of the famous Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute for Art History, which is housed in the building today.

193,San Servolo Insane Asylum Museum,"Venice, Italy","Venice's ""Island of the Mad.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-del-manicomio-san-servolo-insane-asylum-museum,"Known as the “Island of the Mad,” for 250 years the Island of San Servolo was the official mental asylum of Venice. Run by the religious order San Giovanni di Dio, the asylum opened in 1725 with the order that all insane men be relocated there. In 1798 it began to accept women as well. Over 200,000 patients were admitted to the asylum, and most would never leave. In 1978, following a change in Italian law, the asylum was closed and the Venice government created the “Istituto per le Ricerche e gli Studi sull´Emarginazione Sociale e Culturale” (Institute for the Study of Social and Cultural Marginalization) to preserve the documents related to the history of the hospital. In 2006, it was reopened in its current form, as a museum dedicated to the history of the asylum. The museum houses the equipment from the mental asylum, as well as the anatomical theater, though the theater is a recreation using the original equipment since the actual room now provides a different use. It is divided into nine sections: the Laboratory, the Ambulatory, Didactic Products, Sickness Therapies, Straightjackets, the Sick, Lodgings, Pharmacy, and Anatomical Theater. The archives hold photo albums of patients from 1874 through to the 20th century, including 13,695 glass plates, and the library holds a collection left by San Servolo and San Clemente Psychiatric Hospitals, such as religious works from the 16th to 18th centuries and more recent medical and scientific works. There is also an extensive park with rare plants and trees which once supplied the pharmacy. The island also houses Venice International University, opened in 1995. Another asylum lies abandoned and off limits in the Venetian lagoon on Poveglia Island, one of the city’s many plague quarantine stations. Near Poveglia, mass graves of plague victims were found on the quarantine islands of Lazzaretto Nuovo and Lazzaretto Vecchio. Number 20 boat stop San Servolo.

194,Rocchetta Mattei,"Grizzana Morandi, Italy",Sitting on an Italian hilltop is this surreal fortress built by the mad inventor of electrohomeopathy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rocchetta-mattei,"Even from the outside, the looming fortress known as Rocchetta Mattei looks like a cobbled together hodge podge of architectural influences, and the interior is even crazier thanks to the castle’s more-than-a-little eccentric creator Cesare Mattei who is best known as the father of “electrohomeopathy,” a medical practice said to cure cancer. Since almost 1200 CE there has been a fortress sitting on the scenic hilltop in the Northern Apennines where the Rocchetta Mattei now stands. Construction of the current castle began in 1850 at the behest of Count Cesare Mattei, a slightly unhinged, self-taught medicine man and politician who had developed his own system of healing that he said harnessed the life energy (electricity) of plants to heal all of Man’s ills, including cancer. Envisioning his castle as the home of his medical revolution, Mattei constructed the “Rocchetta,” as he called it, with the enthusiasm and focus of a child. Mixing medieval, Middle-Eastern, and gothic styles just to name a few, Mattei simply seemed to create the rooms as the whims came to him. The layout of the castle is no better, seemingly like a veritable labyrinth of arbitrarily interconnected rooms. Many of the features were also built from faked or disguised materials such as painted “stained glass.” The rooms each seemed to serve their own strange purpose as well most notably the “Nineties Room” which Mattei specifically built to host a banquet that would occur on the occasion of his 90th birthday, celebrating he and his nonagenarian compatriots. Unfortunately Mattei would never get to host such a party, passing away at the age of 87. After his death the castle changed hands a number of times, and was even once donated to the City of Bologna who declined the bizarre gift. By the 1980s the castle was completely abandoned and falling into disrepair. However an independent conservation group took control of the site in the 2000s and began repairing the site, opening some of it to the public. Mattei’s electrohomeopathy is still practiced in some corners of the world such as India and Pakistan, but the true testament to Mattei’s genius/madness may be his beloved Rocchetta.  It is only possible to visit the castle on Saturday and Sunday. Online reservations are obligatory, as the number of visitors is limited.",fortresses forts eccentric homes castles homes

The park protects the remains of two enormous ancient aqueducts, yet is surprisingly little-visited by tourists to the city. This suburban park was designated a protected area in 1988 after two years of campaigning from a local citizen movement. It is named after the impressive aqueducts that still stand there today, providing one of the most famous landscapes in Rome. In antiquity, these aqueducts carried drinking water from the mountains in the east Lazio (such as the Alban Hills and the Monti Simbruini), and were elevated on monumental arcades once they reached the flat expanse of the Roman countryside. The Aqua Claudia, which is the most impressive aqueduct still standing within the park, was the eighth aqueduct built by the ancient Romans, constructed during the reigns of emperors Caligula and Claudius. It could carry over 2,000 liters of water per second, over 40 miles (70 km) away from its original source. Nearby are the ruins of an even older aqueduct, the Aqua Marcia (which also carried the waters of the Aqua Tepula and Aqua Iulia), built during the late Republican age in 144 BC. This one is not as well preserved since Pope Sixtus V removed parts of the structure to build the first Papal aqueduct, the Aqua Felix, at the end of the 16th century. The Papal aqueduct, which is a lot lower than its ancient Roman counterpart, runs along the Aqua Claudia and intersects it in the nearby park of Tor Fiscale. It ultimately ends at the famous Moses fountain in Piazza San Bernardo. The park is a vast archaeological and natural site that preserves, among other sites, the ruins of the imperial Vignacce Villa (its private baths are still visible); the 12th-century marrana (or ditch) built by the popes to provide water to the gardens of St. John the Lateran; a well-preserved stretch of the Roman road known as the Via Latina; and the 13th century Casale di Torrevecchia, a fortified farmstead that at one point belonged to the powerful Torlonia family.

Along the first four mile stretch of Via Appia, are The Catacombs of San Sebastian. The martyred remains of San Sebastian were buried at the site in 350, and a basilica was erected over the grounds to honor the saint in the early 4th century. At the time, the subterranean burial area became known as ad catacumbas, which means “near the hollows,” due to the excavated mines near the site. This was the first use of term catacombs, and it has since signified underground Christian burials chambers. Since the site was erected, many pilgrims have come to visit and see the relics held at the basilica as well. The basilica is dedicated to San Sebastian, who was martyred, and it houses the arrow that allegedly struck San Sebastian during his murder. Besides the arrow relic, the basilica also possesses a set of marble footprints, that are attributed to Jesus, during his walk to Rome along the Via Appia.

The water below was like a blue-burning fire, lighting up the whole. All around was closed in: but, beneath the water, the little opening by which we entered prolonged itself almost to the bottom of the sea, forty fathoms in depth, and expanded itself to about the same width. Thus the powerful sunshine outside threw a reflected light upon the floor of the grotto, and streaming in now like fire through the blue water, seemed to change it into the burning spirit. Everything gave back the reflection: the rocky arch—all seemed as if formed of consolidated air, and to dissolve away into it. The drops of spray tossed up by the movement of the oars, fell red, like fresh rose leaves. It was a fairy world ” —Hans Christian Andersen, The Improvisatore Visitors to Capri’s famous Grotta Azzurra, or “Blue Grotto”, must lie in the damp bottom of a rowboat, aimed straight at the cliffs. The oarsman waits for a lull in the tides, and ducks through the low opening in the cliff face. Inside, the waters glow brilliant otherworldly blue against the darkness of the cave above. In Roman times, the grotto was the personal swimming hole of Emperor Tiberius, who moved the capital of the Roman Empire to the island in 27 AD. Tiberius is remembered at Capri for his lavish residence at Villa Jovis, atop a thousand-foot drop to the Mediterranean, over which he was reputed to have tossed dissenters. He was succeeded by the infamous Caligula, who also spent time on the island as a young man. In Tiberius’ time, the grotto was decorated with several statues, as well as resting areas around the edge of the cave. The grotto was re-discovered by the outside world in 1826 by the German poet August Kopisch, who wrote about it in his book Entdeckung der Blauen Grotte (Part. Ill, Chap. VI). Word spread quickly, and Capri and the grotto became part of the Victorian era Grand Tour. It has been described by some of the best travel writers of the era. Not much has changed since Mark Twain’s 1869 visit, recorded in Innocent’s Abroad: “The entrance to the cave is four feet high and four feet wide, and is in the face of a lofty perpendicular cliff – the sea-wall. You enter in small boats – and a tight squeeze it is, too. You can not go in at all when the tide is up. Once within, you find yourself in an arched cavern about one hundred and sixty feet long, one hundred and twenty wide, and about seventy high. How deep it is no man knows. It goes down to the bottom of the ocean. The waters of this placid subterranean lake are the brightest, loveliest blue that can be imagined. They are as transparent as plate glass, and their coloring would shame the richest sky that ever bent over Italy. No tint could be more ravishing, no lustre more superb. Throw a stone into the water, and the myriad of tiny bubbles that are created flash out a brilliant glare like blue theatrical fires. Dip an oar, and its blade turns to splendid frosted silver, tinted with blue. Let a man jump in, and instantly he is cased in an armor more gorgeous than ever kingly Crusader wore.” The island of Capri is riddled with caves and grottos, and the Blue Grotto was not a mystery to locals. Known locally as Gradola, it had been avoided as it was said to be inhabited by monsters or evil spirits. The Blue Grotto is 60 meters long by 25 meters wide. The clear blue waters below the boat are 150 meters deep. The unearthly blue light effect is caused by the refraction of daylight through the above water cave opening and a larger submerged opening. The acoustics inside the grotto are famously beautiful. At the back of the main cave, three connecting branches lead to the Sala dei Nomi, or “room of names”, named after the graffiti signatures left by visitors over the centuries. Two more passages lead deeper into the island, before it becomes inaccessible. For many years it was thought that the fissures at the back of the cave may have been ancient stairways leading up to the Emperor’s pleasure palaces, but it now seems that these are merely natural passages which narrow and then end, no palace in sight. Three statues of the sea gods Neptune and Triton were recovered from the grotto floor in 1964 (now on display at a museum in Anacapri), and seven statue bases were found in 2009. The Roman historian Pliny the Elder described the statues in the grotto as “playing on a shell” - the position of the now missing arms of the Triton statue, usually depicted with a conch shell, indicate that these were the statues that he saw in the 1st century AD. Four more statues may yet be hidden in the sandy depths. Swimming in the grotto is now forbidden, both for safety reasons and to preserve the water clarity, however, some intrepid swimmers enter after hours on their own. It is a popular tourist destination on the island, but no less rare, or beautiful, a natural phenomenon for it. A new project by the association Marevivo aims at restoring the Grotto to its Roman appearance, with (copies of) the Roman statues in place.   The grotto is open daily (except Christmas Day and New Year's Day) from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., given favorable sea conditions. In case of strong winds, the mouth of the grotto is unaccessible. The Blue Grotto can be reached by boat from Marina Grande, or bus from Anacapri, or by walking the well-marked path. All access to the Grotto is closed on windy days or when there are waves. Closures usually occur from November to March when the chances of strong winds and waves are higher. During the high season in summer, visitors may need to wait over an hour to get inside.",grottoes underwater caves ecosystems water

It was built under directions from its weirdo owner Giovanni Torlonia (last descendant of a noble Roman family of french descent) who completely made over what was known until 1919 as “The Swiss Hut” in the gargantuan “Villa Torlonia”. The Swiss Hut was a little retreat far from the main houses of the villa, hidden behind a hill. Giovanni Torlonia Jr., a notorious loner, decided to retire there, and build it up into his dream mansion, a mix of medieval themes and delightful Art Nouveau craziness that is not to be missed. Previously known as the “Villaggio Medievale” (medieval town) it became famous for its wonderful stained-glass windows depicting birds, flowers, plants and most of all, owls (from which the house itself takes its current name). There is no way to explain the beauty of this house, without falling into desperate banality. A banker, Giovanni Torlonia Jr. rented the rest of the Villa to Mussolini for a symbolic amount of one lira a year, he died in 1938. From then on a time of sad decline was set into motion for this gorgeous house. It was occupied by the American military during the liberation, and then left abandoned. A fire destroyed most of it in 1978, and it was vandalized and robbed of most of its values. From 1992 until 1997 it’s been restored to its previous magnificent state.

Over the last two-and-a-half millennia, extensive caves and tunnels have been carved out of the tuff, forming a shadow city obscured below the ground. The 280-mile (450-kilometer) subterranean network was formed by the Greeks in the fourth century BC to build what was then named Neapolis, or “New City.” The Romans later used the chambers and pathways to build aqueducts that provided water for many centuries of Neapolitans. As the centuries passed, buildings were constructed on top of previous ancient infrastructure, and the remains of these structures are were hidden deep below the city. Today, Napoli Sotterranea (Naples Underground) offers a chance to explore this Italian city from a different point of view. Down a long case descending some 120 feet (40 meters) below the earth, aqueducts, sewer tunnels, rainwater cisterns, caverns, catacombs, and pre-Christian hypogea can be found in the tuffaceous cavities, along with roadway and rail tunnels. Some caves that were part of the reservoir are still full of water today. One highlight of the subterranean network is the remains of the Greco-Roman theatre of Neapolis, where the Roman emperor Nero also had his private dressing room. Many years later, the underground network was used as an air raid shelter during the Second World War, and you can still see forgotten war relics such as weapons and vehicles in the tunnels. More recently, the first Hypogeum Gardens in the world can be found, an experiment to grow various species of plants far from pollution, but also light, in the dark chambers underneath the city.  Some tunnels are very narrow and it is necessary to use a candle to see, for this reason some passages of the route are optional.",aqueducts subterranean underground tunnels roman hidden infrastructure subterranean sites caves ancient ecosystems ruins

Milan, on the other hand, is a bit more disillusioned about the merits of the financial world. At the very centre of Piazza Affari, the square in Milan where the Italian stock exchange has its headquarters, is a marble statue depicting a hand with only its middle finger standing up. If you look closely, you’ll see that the other fingers are not flexed, but they look as if they were cut off. The impression is the same nevertheless: an unambiguous “fuck you” to the world of bankers and CEOs. The statue bears the title of L.O.V.E., which stands for Libertà, Odio, Vendetta, Eternità (Freedom, Hate, Vengeance, Eternity) and was created in 2010 by the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, known for his provocative works. The statue was supposed to stay in Piazza Affari for just a couple of weeks, but the city government decided to keep it there indefinitely. Cattelan never commented on the meaning of the statue, but most people assume it refers to the economic crisis that affected Europe – and Italy in particular – from 2008 onwards. Some people noticed that, if it weren’t for the severed fingers, the statue would show the infamous fascist salutation, and this can be interpreted as a political statement. It also suits the fact that the Italian stock exchange is based in Palazzo Mezzanotte, a fascist-era building. Piazza Affari is in the business district of Milan, which is definitely not a tourist destination, yet people keep making a detour to see and giggle at the statue. Some of them – even families with children – pose while flipping the bird at the camera, bringing a little bit of edginess to their tour of the city.

Like the amazing rides it would later spawn, the restaurant Ai Pioppi started almost on a whim. As the story goes, the restaurant’s owner, a spirited man by the name of Bruno, simply set up a makeshift food and wine stand beneath a tree, just to see if anyone would show up. By the end of his first day he had almost sold all of the goods he had brought and Ai Pioppi restaurant had begun. After establishing a proper eatery, Bruno paid a visit to a local blacksmith looking for some basic hooks to join some chain. However the surly blacksmith blew him off and told him to make them himself, showing Bruno how to weld, and the man was changed from that day on. He returned to his restaurant and quickly constructed a giant slide as an added attraction to his eatery. Over the next 40 years, Bruno continued to design and build increasingly complex rides with more and more moving parts, although all with out power. From a tumbling, swinging bridge to giant merry-go-rounds to contraptions that nearly defy easy description, the collection of dreamt up amusements grew. Bruno says he got the inspiration for his builds from the movement of the constantly encroaching nature all around.",engineering outsider architecture outsider art

Its thick, mossy branches stretch horizontally, giving it a strangely squashed appearance. The old tree goes by many names, and has inspired its fair share of legends and lore. According to one local legend, witches once gathered at the 600-year-old oak. They danced wildly atop its gnarled branches, transforming the plant into a stage for their chants and ceremonies. Supposedly, their rituals stunted the tree’s growth and warped its shape, causing it to reach outward rather than upward. The old oak inspired another story, too, this one more familiar to children around the world. Carlo Collodi once sat beneath its behemoth branches while penning several chapters of The Adventures of Pinocchio. It inspired the scenes where the famous puppet meets the Cat and the Fox and where he is later rescued by the Blue Fairy after being hanged. As such, one of the tree’s other names is Quercia di Pinocchio (Pinocchio’s Oak). The tree towers within an area that celebrates its Pinocchio connections with other sites related to the story. Italy’s government officially recognizes the legendary tree as a National Monument.

La Specola is the oldest public museum in Europe, having started as the personal collection of the Medici family. It was opened to the public in 1775. Anyone could attend as long as they “looked clean.” The wax anatomical models were a huge hit, and the museum was attended by luminaries such as Goethe (who later wrote The Sorrows of Young Werther) and Emperor Leopold who funded the museum. Of special interest are the wax anatomical Venuses, wax models of naked women posed in old-fashioned semi-erotic poses, but with their rib cages and stomachs pulled open to the world. These gutted female forms were a favorite of the Marquis de Sade. Clemente Susini’s wax models, painstaking to produce and incredibly fragile, can be seen in only a few other locations throughout the world, including the Semmelweis Museum in Budapest, and the Josephinum in Vienna, and the Wax Anatomy Museum at University of Cagliari. The overlooked collection is surprisingly empty in the tourist-packed Florence. While there, you can also check out its zoological collection. Update as of September 2019: The La Specola Museum is closed for refurbishment work and is expected to reopen in the next 18 months.  The anatomical collection is now only viewable by guided tour.

204,Plaster Citizens of Pompeii,"Pompeii, Italy","The last moments of the ill-fated Pompeiians, frozen forever in plaster.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plaster-citizens-of-pompeii,"Those that did not flee the city of Pompeii in August of 79 AD were doomed. Buried for 1,700 years under 30 feet of mud and ash and reduced by the centuries to skeletons, they remained entombed until excavations in the early 1800s. As excavators continued to uncover human remains, they noticed that the skeletons were surrounded by voids in the compacted ash. By carefully pouring plaster of Paris into the spaces, the final poses, clothing, and faces of the last residents of Pompeii came to life. The beginning of the end was August 24, 79 AD, the day after the Roman holiday of Volcanalia, dedicated to the god of fire. At noon Mount Vesuvius roared to life, spewing ash hundreds of feet into the air for 18 hours straight. The choking ash rained down on the cities in the surrounding countryside, filling courtyards, blocking doors, and collapsing roofs. In the only known eye witness account to the eruption, Pliny the Younger reported on his uncle’s ill-fated foray into the thick of the ash from Misenum, on the north end of the bay: “…the buildings were now shaking with violent shocks, and seemed to be swaying to and fro as if they were torn from their foundations. Outside, on the other hand, there was the danger of failing pumice stones, even though these were light and porous; however, after comparing the risks they chose the latter. In my uncle’s case one reason outweighed the other, but for the others it was a choice of fears. As a protection against falling objects they put pillows on their heads tied down with cloths. “ And then: “You could hear the shrieks of women, the wailing of infants, and the shouting of men; some were calling their parents, others their children or their wives, trying to recognize them by their voices. People bewailed their own fate or that of their relatives, and there were some who prayed for death in their terror of dying. Many besought the aid of the gods, but still more imagined there were no gods left, and that the universe was plunged into eternal darkness for evermore.” The next morning, the cone of the volcano collapsed, triggering a hundred mile an hour avalanche of mud and ash that flooded Pompeii, just a little over five miles away, and destroyed everything in its path. Pompeii and its smaller neighboring village of Herculaneum disappeared, and were only discovered by accident during the construction of King Charles III of Bourbon’s palace in 1738. Miraculously, the two cities were nearly perfectly preserved under calcified layers of ash. About 3/4 of Pompeii’s 165 acres have been excavated, and some 1,150 bodies have been discovered out of an estimated 2,000 thought to have died in the disaster. This means that the vast majority of the city of 20,000 fled at the first signs of the volcanic activity. The plaster casts of the men, women, children, and animals of Pompeii were primarily made in the mid 1800s. The Antiquarium, near the Forum, once held most of the plaster casts. It was damaged during Allied bombing in 1943, and has been closed since 1978 for restoration. The Garden of the Fugitives holds the largest number of victims found in one place, where thirteen people sought refuge in a fruit orchard. Nine sets of remains were found at the House of Mysteries, where the roof collapsed trapping them inside. One plaster cast can be seen inside the Caupona Pherusa tavern. The Stabian Thermal baths and the Macellum (fish market) both house two plaster casts, and the Horrea (granary) and Olitorium (market) holds several more, including a pig, and what may be the most famous cast of all, a small dog in a collar writhing on its back. Though Pompeii is still being excavated, new casts are not being made because the plaster damages the fragile remains of of the corpses. In 2010 an exhibition including several of the Pompeii plaster casts opened at the Antiquarium de Boscoreale, near Pompeii. Many of the artifacts from Pompeii are now located at the National Museum in Naples (Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli), including the famous “Secret Cabinet” of erotic art. One million people now live in Naples, in the shadow of Vesuvius. According to National Geographic Magazine in 2006, “[Volcanologists] Sheridan and Mastrolorenzo have calculated that there is a greater than 50 percent chance of a major eruption each year now, the odds rising incrementally as the time since the last big plinian event grows longer year by year.”",death masks long now locations disaster areas volcanoes memento mori death geology ruins
205,The Village of Craco,"Province of Matera, Italy",An Italian hillside ghost town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/craco-matera,"After surviving the black plague and bands of marauding thieves for more than 1,400 years, a landslide finally forced residents from Craco in 1991. Considering the hillside village’s long tenure, it’s amazing the residents were not forced out earlier by Mother Nature. Craco was founded in the 8th century, and was a brilliant survivor considering the volatile nature of the medieval period. The village sits on a cliff 400 meters off of the ground. With panoramic views, the city center can easily be defended from the average barbarian horde. Despite its advantages, Craco is at a serious natural disadvantage. Exposed to the elements along with earthquakes and landslides, Craco finally caved in near the millennium. Even without residents, the storied history of the town has left quite a monument to medieval architecture through the ages. The striking castle was built in 1300 and dominates the view on the cliff. Along with the castle, a church in Craco houses a statue of the Virgin Mary that was remarkably discovered in a nearby body of water. Even though emigration has left Craco eerily uninhabited, life returns to the town during one of the many religious festivals held there paying homage to the Virgin Mary and the statue. Six festivals happen in Craco from May to October. Visitors coming during other seasons can still enjoy the dilapidated town and views of the surrounding area, which include “calanchi,” arid and barren mounds below the cliffs of Craco.

The communities of Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore were intensely isolated up until the 19th century, when railroads connected them with the rest of Italy. The advent of this newfound connectivity also meant a loss of tradition and youth population. However, a boom in tourism in the 1970s brought people back to Cinque Terre, where they were charmed by the quaint, ancient villages. A special train line connects the villages along the coast. Visitors especially praised the painted villas. The pastel colors, sun-faded and rustic, were said to date back to the beginning of the village. The fishermen allegedly painted their homes in such a rainbow so that they could spot them from the sea amid the jumble of seaside buildings. In reality though, the pastel paint jobs showed up in the 1970s along with the tourists. Most of the Cinque Terre villages didn’t even depend on fishing for income. Though the truth may not be as romantic as the legend, the villages are inarguably lovely, and these villages on the coast are now a UNESCO Heritage Site.  Parking can be tricky.

207,Civita di Bagnoregio,"Civita, Italy",This quaint Italian town keeps losing ground as the sides of its plateau slowly erode.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/civita-di-bagnoregio,"Resting atop a lovely volcanic tower, the small town of Civita di Bagnoregio in central Italy has clung to its high perch for centuries, but as the soft clay ground on its sides erodes, both square footage and architecture are being lost. The tiny town was first built around 2,500 years ago by the ancient Etruscans. Civita was built atop a tall column of volcanic tuff with only one central entrance through a stone arch. The borders of the circular town became flush with the edges of the plateau, as the tightly packed architecture filled the limited space atop the column. The soft clay that made up much of the base of the town was prone to erosion already, and along with natural disasters that further weakened the base, the architecture was always in danger of crumbling off the edge. In the 17th century, Bagnoregio, once a suburb of the hilltop town, became its own settlement as people moved to the more stable town. The more ancient Civita remained, but was only connected by the slim donkey path that led to the entrance arch. The town was never abandoned, but quickly became desolate as the young people left for bigger cities and the old people only spent part of their time in the town. In the modern age, the donkey path has finally eroded away and now the only way to the small, remote village is via a permanent footbridge that has been installed. Supplies only make it up there via moped or three-wheeled “apès” (bees), tiny motorized pickup trucks. The population reaches about 100 during the summer months and drops into the double digits during winter.  Plans to shore up the slopes of the town with metal bars have been discussed, although this does not seem to have happened yet.  Follow the road to the very end for the closest parking lot.

Based on strong pastel colors, vintage wallpaper patterns, and quirky details, every square inch exudes the whimsical atmosphere of a Wes Anderson film. The furniture and decor is also an homage to the typical midcentury Milanese café design, while the ceiling recalls the vaulted glass roof of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan. Anderson has said the place was conceived as a bar where he would want to spend his afternoon, and where writers can go to be inspired. Despite his well-known maniacal sense of symmetry, the place is designed asymmetrical to be “lived” by the visitors in any space and any point of view, without a dominant perspective. There are some references to Anderson’s movies, too, such as the Steve Zissou and Castello Cavalcanti pinball machines.  Bar Luce is alongside Fondazione Prada, but they have two distinct entrances.

209,Gabinetto Segreto,"Naples, Italy","The once forbidden ""secret cabinet"" of erotic art from excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gabinetto-segreto,"Roman sexuality was a big problem for the 19th-century archaeologists and curators responsible for excavating and preserving the remains of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Romans in general, and citizens of Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum in particular, had a robust appreciation for the erotic in art and everyday objects. The enormously well-endowed god Priapus was a common good-luck symbol, seen in everything from frescoes to penis-shaped wind chimes to perky oil lamps. (His huge member supposedly had little to do with sex: It served to scare off thieves.) Stories from mythology painted on walls were full of sexual encounters, secret trysts, and naughty satyrs. In some ways, this erotica was widely accepted on a level that even modern society would have trouble with, let alone Victorian Europe. The looting of Pompeii began in the late 1700s under the direction of Charles of Bourbon, better known as Charles III of Spain, who was after fashionable antiquities for his private collections. When Napoleon’s brother rolled into town in 1806, the French regime drew up the first organized plans to excavate the city in its entirety, and this process continued when control of Naples reverted to the Bourbons under Ferdinand I. As was common for excavations of the period, frescoes were stripped from the walls, and small decorative objects, pieces of furniture, and statues were removed for safe storage, study, and display elsewhere. In this case, they were relocated to the National Museum (Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli). In 1816, a limited-edition French guide to the collection—with illustrations—began making its way around Europe. Most copies were confiscated and destroyed by the French authorities, and the guide eventually became a highly sought-after collector’s item. When Ferdinand’s son, Francis I, visited with his wife and young daughter in 1819, he was shocked by the explicit imagery and ordered all items of a sexual nature be removed from view and locked in a secret cabinet, where access could be restricted to scholars (and male visitors willing to bribe the staff). In Pompeii itself, metal shutters were installed over erotic paintings, making these 2,000-year-old images accessible to male tourists for an extra fee. All of this fervor only served to make the collection more famous, and it became a rite of passage for European gentlemen to view the secret collection on their Grand Tours. Among dozens of stone penises, phallic wind chimes, and naughty mosaics, one item became the most famous: The Goat. This piece de resistance is a detailed carving of a satyr having intercourse with a female goat, her cloven feet pressed up against his chest as she gazes back at him with some fondness. In 1849, the collection was bricked off and remained famously off-limits to women, youngsters, and the general public. For a century and a half, it stayed out of sight, on view only during brief liberal periods under Garibaldi and again in the 1960s. The Gabinetto Segreto was finally opened to the public in 2000 and moved into a separate gallery in 2005.  This is part of the Naples National Archaeological Museum.

It was designed by Maurizio Codussi and built beginning in 1496. The clock displays the time, the phase of the moon, and the dominant sign of the Zodiac. Venetian legend holds that when the clock was revealed on February 1, 1499, it was so beautiful that the doge had the clockmaker blinded so that he could not create another to rival it. In reality, the two master mechanics of the clock were made its caretakers, beginning the tradition that the clock’s keepers live in the tower with their families. The clock tower is topped by two bronze figures who strike the bell hourly. Although they were originally designated as giants, their dark patina lent them the nickname “Moors.” A relief of the winged lion of St. Mark, patron saint and symbol of Venice, stands on an open book below the Moors. A statue of the Virgin Mary stands one level down, above the massive clock face. The clock was intentionally designed to sit high enough in the square to be protected from Venice’s waters and to be visible from the canal. On Ascension Week and Epiphany, carved figures of the four Magi join the Moors hourly, emerging from the clock face and bowing to the Virgin Mary above them. An angel raises a trumpet in recognition of them, and the Magi bow in return. Inside the tower, the clock mechanism shares space with living quarters. Guided tours climb the 19th-century spiral staircases inside the tower all the way up to the rooftop Moors. The clock and the tower buildings have been modified and restored many times over the years, including the addition of one of the world’s first digital displays in 1858. Two internal huge drums spin to display the hours and minutes in Roman and Arabic numerals on either side of the Madonna. Most recently, the clock emerged from scaffolding from the thorough overhauling of 1998-2006 in honor of the clock’s 500th anniversary.

Bruno was a Dominican friar during in the 1500s whose big ideas about the nature of the universe led to his public execution. Despite his training as a member of the Catholic order, Bruno came to believe that the universe was infinite and that there were multiple important worlds, all of which were equally overseen by an aspect of God. Of course the ruling church of the time branded Bruno a heretic and held a trial that took seven years to complete. Finally on February 17, 1600 Bruno, who never recanted on his beliefs, was led into the Campo de’ Fiori with a spike thrust through his tongue. At the request of Cardinal Bellarmine he was burned at the stake and his ashes were cast into the nearby river Tiber, creating a controversial proto-martyr for the scientific revolution. Witnesses wrote that before the fire was lit he refused to kiss a crucifix preferring to die a martyr in the hopes that the flames carry his soul into heaven. In 1889 the current monument to the philosopher was erected, with the robed figure of Bruno facing the Vatican. Church officials rankled at the clear offense, but could not get the statue removed. While the Vatican has issued apologies for its misguided persecution of early scientific searchers such as Galileo, to this day they have refused to remove Bruno’s label of heretic despite a small amount of public outcry. However the statue that stands tall among the oblivious tourists milling about the Campo de Fiori ensures that Bruno’s tragedy is not forgotten.",statues
212,Medici Hall of Maps (Sala delle Carte Geografiche),"Florence, Italy",Over 50 exquisite hand-painted Renaissance maps decorate a Medici storage room.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sala-delle-carte-geografiche-hall-of-maps,"When Giorgio Vasari undertook the restoration of the grand old Palazzo della Signoria, now known as the Palazzo Vecchio, he envisioned a new room adorned with maps of Italy and the known world, portraits of all of the great minds of the era, and illustrations of exotic plants and animals from far off lands. Vasari made plans for two enormous globes - one of the earth, another of the heavens - to lower from the ceiling onto bases so perfectly designed, the lightest touch would send them spinning. The room he made these elaborate plans for was not the entry hall, or the offices, or the grand assembly room. It was instead the Guardaroba Nuevo, or “new storeroom,” a new addition to the many storage rooms that held the Medici family treasures in order. When Cosimo I de’ Medici, the Duke of Florence, was elected at the young age of 17, he was an unknown upstart. Raised largely in the countryside without the elaborate urban education and training his predecessors had enjoyed, the new duke turned to Vasari to help him establish his legacy. In the end, Cosimo I “the Great” became one of history’s great art patrons, giving Florence the Uffizi, the Vasari Corridor over the Ponte Vecchio, and a re-vitalized Palazzo della Signoria. The Palazzo Vecchio was first built in 1299 as the seat of power in Florence. Cosimo I charged Vasari with retrofitting the palace to meet the needs of the Renaissance empire. In 1563 they employed the gifted Italian priest, mathematician and mapmaker Ignazio Danti to complete the vision of a grand hall of maps. In the room now known as the Sala delle Carte Geografiche (Hall of maps) on the second floor of the Palazzo Vecchio, 54 maps decorate cabinet fronts, alongside 237 portraits of luminaries of the Renaissance. Inspired largely by the illustrated Renaissance edition of Ptolomy’s “Geographica” as well as new innovations in cartography by Mercator  and Orelius, Danti painted the first 31 maps between 1563-1575, followed by another 23 maps created by Stefano Bonsignori, granducal cosmographer to Cosimo I’s son, Francesco I de’ Medici. The Santucci armillary sphere (now at the Florence Museum of the History of Science) once also was displayed Sala delle Carte Geografiche, along with a second, earlier armillary sphere that is now lost. The room is sometimes referred to as the Sala del Mappamundo, after the huge terrestrial globe also created by Danti that now sits in the middle of the room. Although the original vision of it descending from the ceiling never came to pass, it was built on a specially designed base, and it was, in his own words “moved in any direction by the touch of a single finger.” The second celestial globe was never completed. Unfortunately an ill-advised move to the Uffizi in later years left the existing globe subject to the elements, and it is now much darkened and weathered. Perhaps most sad is that with its original base lost, it no longer moves with the smooth motion that made Danti so proud. Years after his work in Florence, Danti was called to Rome where he created the Vatican’s vast Gallery of Maps the last of his great cartographical works. Sala delle Carte Geografiche is located on the second floor of Palazzo Vecchio.",dead explorers marvelous maps and measures geography repositories of knowledge maps history
213,Santuario Madonna della Corona,"Ferrara di Monte Baldo, Italy",This centuries-old Italian chapel hangs midway down a sheer cliffside.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santuario-madonna-della-corona,"Built over 2,000 feet above sea level into a vertical cliff face on Italy’s Mount Baldo in front of Valdadige. The Santuario Madonna della Corona (Sanctuary of the Lady of the Crown) looks as though it is nearly suspended in mid-air. The church does not actually hang on the sheer face but instead sits on a thin rock shelf that can only be reached by a thin path from below and a street from above. Originally the secluded shelf was home to a hermitage where holy men could come for silent reflection, completely removed from the rest of the world. The actual church was built in 1530 and the site became a chapel for anyone wanting to pay pilgrimage and contemplate the nature of God in peace. The main chapel saw a number of changes over the ensuing centuries growing larger and at one point having a larger church built over the existing one. Thanks to its relative inaccessibility the church was never totally destroyed or desecrated and managed to survive into the 20th century, crumbling a bit but intact. In the 1970s an Italian architect tore down much of the aging structure and built it back up, taking care to retain as many important artistic flourishes as possible. Today the once treacherous mountain path to the chapel has been modernized and the remarkable church is still a popular pilgrimage site for visitors coming to see the Scala Santa, a replica of the stairs to Pilate’s palace that Jesus ascended before he was condemned to be crucified. Oh and also to see a church cling to a cliff like it is in hiding.

214,La Scarzuola,"Montegabbione (TR), Italy",This 16th-century monastery has been turned into a surrealist architecture compound.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-scarzuola,"Although La Scarzuola began as a Franciscan monastery, today’s architectural wonderland has little to do with traditional religion, reflecting instead the esoteric beliefs of a visionary Milanese architect. That architect, Tomaso Buzzi, acquired the property in 1956 with the grand plan of juxtaposing the “sacred city” of the monastery with his own “ideal city” that would be a hauntingly dreamlike allegory for the mysteries and perplexing paths of the ideal life. His style blends reality with surrealist architecture, incorporating structures and details from Classical to Medieval and even Renaissance architecture, all tied together by overarching Neomannerist elements such as stairways leading in multiple directions, general unbalance and disproportion, and monstrous and fantastical design elements. His work spans the body of surrealism from Dali and Miro to M.C. Escher, echoing their dark works in his immense compound. The core of the Città Ideale is formed by seven theaters, representing Buzzi’s notion that the ideal life (and the mysterious initiations associated with it) is inherently and symbolically theatrical. The theaters are surrounded by grounds that include multiple grottos and reflecting pools and are surmounted by an “Acropolis” that consists of a riot of buildings all piled together (including many reproductions — the Arc de Triomphe, the Temple of Vesta, the Parthenon, etc.), which are mostly empty inside, save for stairways and inner bridges. Each work is carefully constructed to represent the inner thoughts of the artist, as well as a blend of the philosophical tenets that guided his life. Although the styles and buildings change by the meter in the compound, his overall surrealistic approach is defined especially through the random scattering of quotes and strange symbols placed throughout La Scarzuola. Considered the artist’s “autobiography in stone,” La Scarzuola is deeply personal and those familiar with the artist will find him in every brick laid in the compound. After his death in 1981, his nephew Marco Solari continued to work on La Scarzuola, eventually completing the vision his uncle had for his ideal city.

215,Villa de Vecchi,"Cortenova, Italy","The abandoned ""Ghost Mansion"" was left to decay in the mountains of Northern Italy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/villa-de-vecchi,"Just east of Lake Como, nestled against the forested mountains of Cortenova, sits a house that’s said to be haunted. Villa De Vecchi, alternately nicknamed the Red House, Ghost Mansion, and Casa Delle Streghe (The House of Witches), was built between 1854-1857 as the summer residence of Count Felix De Vecchi. Within a few short years of its completion the house witnessed an inexplicable string of tragedies that would forever cement its gothic legacy. Count Felix De Vecchi was head of the Italian National Guard and a decorated hero following Milan’s liberation from Austrian rule in 1848. A well-read and widely traveled man, the Count set out to build a dream retreat for his family with the help of architect Alessandro Sidoli. Alessandro Sidioli died a year before the villa was completed, and many would later view his death as the first ill omen. Nevertheless, the Count and his family made Villa De Vecchi their home during the spring and summer months, and by most accounts lead an idyllic—if brief—existence. Set within a 130,000-square-meter park, the great mansion boasted a blend of Baroque and Classical Eastern styles, and was outfitted with all the modern conveniences of the time including indoor heating pipes, dumbwaiters, and a large-scale pressurized fountain. The walls and ceilings were decorated with painstakingly detailed frescoes and friezes, and a larger-than-life fireplace presided over the main parlor where a grand piano stood at the ready. Extensive gardens and promenades rounded out the already picturesque surroundings, and an equally impressive staff house was built. Sometime in 1862 the Count returned home to find his wife brutally murdered and daughter missing. The Count put out a lengthy, unsuccessful search for his daughter, before committing suicide that same year. The villa was then passed on to Felix’s brother Biago, whose later renovations oversaw the removal of much of the estate’s Eastern aspects. Biago and his family continued to live on the grounds up until WWII, after which they vacated for good. The house made the rounds of owners and prospective buyers, but by the 1960’s was left permanently uninhabited. While the natural elements began their assault early on, the majority of the abandoned house’s irreversible damage has been done by humans. Graffiti covers the walls, and anything capable of being vandalized has been given its due makeover.  Bad boy occultist Aleister Crowley allegedly spent a few nights at the villa in the 1920’s, which naturally led to a rise in fan pilgrimages. Rumors of ritualistic orgies, sacrifices (both animal and human), suicides, and murders abound. The grand piano, once said to be played at night by a ghostly entity, has since been smashed to pieces, though some locals claim that music can still be heard coming from the house. Despite all natural and human efforts to bring about its demise, Villa De Vecchi persists. An avalanche in 2002 wiped out all of the nearby houses, while the villa remained untouched.  First and foremost, technically going into the house is trespassing. A few tattered signs will tell you as much, so be mindful. Daylight hours are best for visiting, and not just because of things that go bump in the night; the house really is at its most viewable (and for safety’s sake, navigable) during the day. Second, and maybe even more importantly, the house IS falling apart, and faster than ever. Recently one of the upper floors gave out, taking a woman with it. The stairs are rapidly deteriorating, and bits of ceiling regularly rain down. Hard hats and knee pads aren't necessarily a must, but be cautious and maybe avoid the upper levels altogether. Last but far from least, please be respectful of the house and its surroundings. Villa De Vecchi is truly a magnificent piece of architecture, and unique example of one man’s vision that surpassed typical McMansion standards.",aleister crowley abandoned houses villas suicide murder mansions haunted houses homes abandoned
216,Museum of the Holy Souls in Purgatory,"Rome, Italy",A collection of objects supposedly singed by the hands of souls in purgatory.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-holy-souls-purgatory,"Located in the back of the Chiesa del Sacro Cuore del Suffragio on the banks of the Tiber, the tiny century-old Piccolo Museo Del Purgatorio, or “Museum of the Holy Souls in Purgatory,” holds a collection of bibles, prayer books, tabletops, and articles of clothing said to have been singed by the hands of souls in purgatory. According to Catholic belief, the soul is stranded in purgatory until it atones for its sins, but can hasten its ascent to heaven through the prayers of loved ones still on earth. The scorched handprints and other burn-marks collected in this museum are believed to be the product of souls begging their earth-bound loved ones to pray harder. Though not mentioned in the Bible, the idea of purgatory is a very old part of the Catholic faith, dating back to at least the 11th century. The notion that trapped souls might need to be freed comes from a story allegedly told to the Abbott Odilo of Cluny by a monk returning from the Holy Land. He told the Abbott how his ship had been wrecked, and he had been cast ashore on a mysterious island. A hermit who lived on the island related his own story of a mysterious chasm, from which burst forth demonic flames and the agonized screams of trapped souls. He pointed out that the demons were always complaining about losing souls when the living prayed or gave alms to the poor on their behalf. The freeing of these trapped souls became a priority for the Church, and for family members grieving dead loved ones. November 2 was established as All Soul’s Day, whereon it was believed that prayers by the living could intercede on behalf of the faithful dead who had died without absolution, or babies who had died before baptism, thus freeing them for Heaven. (According to Catholic doctrine, one cannot go to hell from purgatory.) Victor Jouet, the collector and French missionary, was supposedly inspired to build this purgatorial museum after a fire destroyed a portion of the original Chiesa del Sacro Cuore del Suffragio, leaving behind the scorched image of a face that he believed to be a trapped soul. The museum’s small collection of objects is contained in a single glass case. Located in the Chiesa del Sacro Cuore del Suffragio. Ask at the sacristy to see the museum.",relics and reliquaries
217,BackDoor 43,"Milan, Italy","One of the world’s smallest bars, just 13 square feet, is brimming with speakeasy flair.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/backdoor-43,"At number 43 on Ripa di Porta Ticinese, a long, canal-side street filled with luxury restaurants, a minuscule wooden bar quietly stands out. BackDoor 43, as it is known, claims to be the world’s smallest bar. Guests can book the space for two hours at a time, during which they’ll find themselves spirited away from the hustle and bustle of city life in their own private club. The bar is just 43 square feet (4 square meters) in size, including a bathroom. There are just three stools for patrons to sit and sip upon. A key and a secret password are also required for entry. Most customers purchase their drinks through the tiny slot window, through which they can see the bartender’s hands and not much else. Secrecy is key here: If takeaway drinkers do sneak a peek through the slot, they’ll find the bartender’s face obscured by a mask. BackDoor 43 announced its grand opening not with advertisements or promotions, but secret riddles and books hidden throughout Milan. The bar uses every square inch of its closet-like space. From floor to ceiling, wooden apothecary shelves house alcohol, various herbs, flowers, and tinctures. Mugs dangle from hooks lining the walls. Betwixt the bottles are esoteric items that bring to mind a cabinet of curiosity, like diagrams of hot air balloons and antique magnifying glasses. The ceiling is papered with an old map, and the entire bar (all 13 square feet of it) feels like a secret speakeasy. The bartender mixes on a tiny countertop complete with a camp stove. The night’s menu is tailored for the guests. Their ingredients are top shelf, with over 60 rare whiskeys alone, and drinks are served with classy, old fashioned flair. The Bahamas is served in a retro tiki glass, while the Guatemalan Diamond comes in a gem-shaped glass served atop a pile of smoking roasted coffee beans. Whether leaving BackDoor 43 after two hours of private speakeasy relaxation or just walking away from the window with a paper cup of liquor in hand, you’re sure to be left with a lingering sense of wonder in the small things. Update June 2020: The restaurant has reopened for take away from 7 p.m.  From the start of Ripa di Porta Ticinese, with the center of the city behind you, the Backdoor 43 is at the number 43, on the left side of the canal.",world's smallest speakeasies miniatures bars alcohol shops
218,Fontanelle Cemetery Caves,"Naples, Italy",Skulls from the plague of 1656 and World War II bombings are united by a cult dedicated to caring for the ancient dead.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fontanelle-cemetery-caves,"Like many ossuaries in Europe, the Cimitero Fontanelle began as a secondary burial ground when the churchyards and crypts began to overflow. Unlike other ossuaries, the skulls of the anonymous dead were lovingly cared for, named, and then asked for prophecies of winning lotto numbers. The offloading of temporarily buried remains into this cave on the outskirts of town began during the Spanish occupation of Naples in the 1500s, but the majority of its 40,000 residents came from the devastating plague outbreak of 1656 and smaller cholera epidemics in the 1830s. The 1656 plague arrived in January, and by August had claimed the lives of an estimated 150,000 people, or half the population of Naples. It took generations for the city to recover from the effects of the outbreak, and the victims died and were buried (or tossed into a cave) under the most chaotic of circumstances, often without last rites, almost always without any grave marker. In the tradition of the highly Catholic populace, these poor souls were trapped in a form of purgatory. The Fontanelle was a haunted place to be avoided at all costs, with the only exception being adding more bodies in times of outbreak. Over time, the ossuary became so crowded with haphazardly stacked bones and bodies that at one point during a heavy rainfall, the city was inundated by a flood of skulls and bones. Starting in 1872, Father Gaetano Barbati began the enormous task of cataloging and organizing the anonymous remains. They remained unburied, but were sorted and placed on shelves and racks, in boxes or crypts. As the remains were sorted, volunteers would pray for the deceased as they worked, the beginning an unusual relationship with the dead. Long-dead anonymous skulls were given names by the women who cared for them, who would often return to chat with or ask favors from the dead, placing wishes written on papers rolled up into the empty eye sockets. This “cult of the dead” sustained itself as a uniquely Neapolitan subculture until the bombings of World War II. Naples was the most heavily bombed city in Italy, and the Fontanelle, along with the other underground spaces in the city, served as a bomb shelter. The Fontanelle is a combination of natural caves, tufa mines, and ancient Greek and Roman tunnels. Naples, in the shadow of Vesuvius, is located in the Campi Flegrei, or “Fiery Fields,” an area of intense volcanic activity that has left the area riddled with caves, thermal springs, and craters. The early Greek residents of the area carved and quarried the soft volcanic stone, using some of the underground spaces as their own burial places. The Romans that followed dug networks of tunnels and aqueducts through the hills, often connected with the natural cave systems, all of which leaves modern Naples and the surrounding countryside riddled with underground spaces of all kinds. Following the war, the Fontanelle cult reached its height, with women caring for and conversing with the skulls, bringing flowers and offerings, and asking for wishes to be granted. Many skulls were claimed and housed in wooden niches by individuals as personal lucky charms or fonts of prophecy—the most sought after fortune telling skill being a skull with a gift for lotto numbers. The cemetery also became a popular make-out spot as well as a late night haunt for those dabbling in a bit of black magic. In an attempt to sanctify the space, a small church, Maria Santissima del Carmine, was built near the opening to the cave, but was largely ignored. All of this lasted until the Cardinal of Naples finally ordered the cemetery be closed to end the troubling obsession with lucky skulls in 1969. The cemetery has remained closed, with restoration efforts started again in 2000–2004 to again sort the remains as well as reinforce the structure of the cave. After years of being off limits, it is now open by reservation.  Entrance is free. Guided tours of the cemetery are available, and it's best to book them in advance.",plague ossuaries catacombs and crypts subterranean sites caves ecosystems sacred spaces
219,Spiaggia Rosa (Pink Beach),"La Maddalena, Italy",Crushed coral and crystals give the sand its signature coloration.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spiaggia-rosa-pink-beach,"You’d think that pink beaches only existed in the mind of Dr. Seuss, but on the Italian island of Budelli, they’re a reality. At the Italian Mediterranean’s magical Spiaggia Rosa (Pink Beach), a unique melange of marine matter gives the sand a peculiar pink pigment. Spiaggia Rosa is one of the few places on the planet to have pink sand. As a result, it’s one of the most unique and paradisiacal spots on the Italian Mediterranean. The brilliant color of Spiaggia Rosa comes from a concoction of crushed fossils, crystals, coral, and dead marine creatures, which blend together to tint the sand with a rosy blush. In the past, the beach at Budelli was a lot more pink. But decades ago, when tourism to Budelli began to surge, visitors began to steal the pink sand to sell it elsewhere or keep it as a souvenir. This depleted the amount of pink sand on the beach, and as a result, the Italian government made it illegal for any tourists to set foot on the beach in 1994 to preserve the beach’s brilliant hue. During the summer, visitors are allowed to take day trips to the island as long as they stay off Spiaggia Rosa. They can look, but not touch, the beautiful sand. When it comes to protecting the pink sand of Budelli, the Italian government doesn’t mess around. When New Zealand banker Michael Harte attempted to establish an eco-friendly resort and biological observatory on the island in 2013, the Italian government responded by blocking his proposal in an effort to preserve the environment. Hopefully, with efforts like these, the pink sand of Budelli will not wash away for a long time.",pink beach color beaches geological oddities islands geology

The popes are listed to the left of the altar and their reigns range from Sixtus V in 1583 to Leo XIII in 1903. The custom of separating the organs from the corpse was called praecordia and was done to prevent decay while funeral arrangements were made. There is a large collection of ex voto in this church, most depicting the Sacred Heart. These are small metal ornaments that are left by the faithful as a token of thanks when their prayers are answered. The church faces the more famous Trevi Fountain. As with many churches in Italy, the dress code is strictly enforced. Bare shoulders and knees are prohibited.

221,Scala Contarini del Bovolo,"Venice, Italy","This palatial spiral staircase was so unusual the name ""snail"" was given to the noble family who built it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/scala-contarini-del-bovolo,"Hidden in the center of Venice, unknown to most tourists, is a spiraling “snail” staircase that winds up the tower-like facade of a historic palazzo. It was so unique at the time it was built at the very end of the 15th century that it’s responsible for naming both the palace it’s attached to and the entire branch of the Contarini noble family that lived there. Secluded in the middle of the sestiere of San Marco, the palazzo’s crowning feature is the large interior flight of winding stairs that spirals up into the sky, named the Scala Contarini del Bovolo. “Del Bovolo” translates to “of the snail” in the Venetian dialect, referring to the spiral shape of the scala (staircase). The winding tower was so popular, the “bovolo” name became forever attached to not only the palace but also the Contarini family, one of the founding families of Venice, who had the spiraling facade built to showcase their great wealth. The scala with its attached arcades spirals 90 feet high, combining elements of Gothic, Renaissance, and Byzantine styles. Visitors can climb to the top of its 80 steps, from which there is a beautiful view over the rooftops of the city. The architectural gem is depicted in Jacopo de Barbari’s famous bird’s eye view of Venice, painted in 1500 (now held at the Museo Correr). The storybook staircase also made a prominent appearance in Orson Welles’ 1952 adaptation of Shakespeare’s Othello.  Access is limited on a daily basis and during the busy tourist season it is recommended to purchase your tickets in advance.

And there is no place in Rome quite as marvelous as the Santa Maria della Vittoria for that reason. While relics are often just parts of saints, this beautiful baroque church displays the full corpse of an “incorruptible saint” in a glass case you can walk right up to to view—a rarity in Rome. This is the preserved corpse of the beautiful Saint Victoria. Incorruptible bodies are those believed to not succumb to the normal process of decomposition by way of divine intervention. But Saint Victoria’s body needed a little help. Her incomplete corpse was supplemented with wax and hair and clothes from someone else entirely, adorned with a crown of roses. Saint Victoria, the patron of Anticoli, Italy, was an early christian martyr. She is one of many examples of faithful Catholic women who were killed after spurning a powerful pagan suitor. You can see her skeleton through some parts of the wax facade, such as her teeth and parts of her hand. Her body now lies in the only completed structure designed by the Baroque architect Carlo Maderno. The church, established by Pope Pius VII in 1801, was featured in Dan Brown’s novel Angels and Demons, which has increased tourism a great deal since it was released in 2000.

In reality it was the local population that has been taking refuge in the caves for hundreds of years. Since at least the 10th century the local population has been taking shelter in the large cave in which the temple now sits, usually hiding out from attacks from marauding enemy tribes. Remains of these earlier uses of the cave were uncovered when the temple was built in 1828 at the behest of the reigning pope. A crude hermitage was also installed right near the entrance to the temple. The ornate design features a domed roof covering an octagonal silo structure meant to symbolize Jesus’ resurrection after three days. The isolated mountain temple is known as the “Refuge of Sinners,” and acted as a pilgrimage site for those seeking forgiveness. The interior originally held a marble Madonna and Child sculpted by Italian artist Antonio Canova; however, the original has been moved to a local museum and a replacement was installed in the temple. While the idiosyncratic hidden temple is more of a tourist attraction than a site of solemn prayer, the shrine inside is still a religious site kept in good order.",hidden temples caves ecosystems architectural oddities architecture
224,Devil's Hole,"St Mary, Jersey",This natural crater along the coast of Jersey may take its name from the devil statues who have watched over it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-devils-hole-st-mary-jersey,"There is a natural crater along the north coast of Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands between England and France. It wasn’t caused by a meteorite, but most likely by the collapse of a cave thousands of years ago. At the top there is a bronze namesake of a statue, to guide you down the trail to the Devil’s Hole. The Hole is about 100 feet in diameter, and 200 feet deep. The constant smashing of the waves makes it into a kind of blowhole, complete with eerie sucking sounds as the water is pulled down and out into the Channel. It was originally called Le Creux de Vis, or the Spiral Hollow, but sometime around 1850 or so the name was changed. How it got to be called the Devil’s Hole is the source of some speculation and debate. Some say it’s the strange sounds made by the waves, but the story most often told goes like this: It was about 1851 when a ship’s carved figurehead was found bobbing up and down inside Le Creux de Vis. The story isn’t exactly clear on where it came from—some say it was from a French shipwreck—or how it managed to hit a perfect bullseye and land in the crater. A local craftsman is said to have taken the figure home, fixed it up, added horns, and placed it back along the rim of the basin. From then on, it’s been called the Devil’s Hole. Being made of wood, such a figure couldn’t survive the harsh elements of the Jersey coast, so over the years, replacement devils have been swapped in. The current devil is weathered bronze, a somewhat spooky guide that stands in an algae-covered pool along the top of the trail. As part of the National Trust for Jersey’s protected lands, the area around the Devil’s Hole and the path to get there has been stabilized in recent years, and a viewing platform has been added for a birds-eye view. It’s surrounded by pasture with grazing sheep, so as you make your way down the path be careful to close any gates behind you. And leave the wooly creatures alone—the statue is scary enough without more little devils to watch out for.  Access to the Devil’s Hole is either from the trail head at the Priory Inn (use La Grande Rue or Le Chemin des Hougues to get to the Inn), or you can walk there along the cliff path. It's about a 10 or 15 minute hike to get down, and on the way to the hole you'll be heading downhill (some of the path is fairly steep). So keep in mind that it's an uphill climb to come back. There are benches along the way, some informational signage about the area, and a viewing platform above the Hole itself.",craters cliffs rock formations natural wonders nature
225,La Hougue Bie,Jersey,A passage grave used in neolithic rituals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-hougue-bie,"Although it has long since been appropriated by two Christian chapels, La Hougue Bie was at one time the site of a vastly different set of spiritual rituals, dating back to 3500 BCE. Hougue is derived from an Old Norse word meaning mound, and seems apt to describe the man-made hill rising from the earth. As with most Neolithic sites, the details surrounding its use are unclear. However, archeological work in the area has discovered that the site was likely used for ceremonies, and some ancient burials. Although it was not used primarily for burials, the site is one of the most well-preserved passage graves in the world. Passage graves were constructed out of giant stones forming a crawl space through a mound of earth. They are found extensively through Europe, but are not usually as well-preserved as La Hougue Bie. The passage grave is similarly fascinating in that it is oriented to receive the sun’s rays and illuminate the farthest recesses of the chamber on the two equinoxes. A few vases were also found in the passage, but without any more information to better understand how it was used and by whom, the 62-foot passage remains a great mystery. With the addition of the two chapels in the medieval period on top of the mound, the site walks visitors through the history of spirituality in Western Europe, and is a fantastic example of pagan sites co-opted by later Christianity. In the Chapel you can see the faded image of fresco paintings of angels over the alter, these were believed to have been painted in the 14th century, unfortunately they were over painted by the victorians in the 19th century.

You’ll sometimes find the British referring to their continental neighbors as “frogs,” a derogatory term that partially stems from the stereotype that French people dine on frog legs. The French retaliated by calling the residents of Jersey (a United Kingdom territory that lies just off the Brittany coast, where French is used as much as English) “les crapauds,” meaning “toads.” Rather than croak about their nickname, the people of Jersey take a certain ironic pride in their “crapaud” status, to the extent that the warty toad has been adopted as a symbol for the island’s residents. So proud are the Jersey people of their moniker that the capital of Saint Helier has boasted a public sculpture of the hoary creature since 2004. The work of artist Gordon Young, the crapaud squats proudly atop his nine-foot column in an area previously known for its marshland toads. But the amicable amphibious association hasn’t always been friendly.

The most obviously unusual element is the general appearance of this massive Kosovar structure. While so many libraries work to bring people inside, Pristina’s public library resembles a giant prison, hardly an appealing image to promote literacy. This building was completed in 1986. Covered in a lattice of fence-like metal, the building’s windows are obstructed, giving views from within the library a captive essence.

Yet the white domes that top the many sections of the library were built to resemble men’s hats of the national outfit, putting the library in the middle of a conflict between tradition and modernity. Despite many people calling the building one of the ugliest in the nation, it is certainly a unique architectural effort, and captures the spirit of a country recently ravaged by war, and working to move forward and rebuild. Inside, there are more than 2 million library items, including rare materials such as books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps and photographs. There are two reading rooms, an amphitheater and a meeting hall. It has been used by Croatian and Bosnian refugees as living quarters and by the Serbian Army as a command center, during which many historical books were destroyed. The library is open to visitors, but guests should bring identification, like a passport.",outsider architecture libraries
228,Mitrovica Miners Monument,"Mitrovica, Kosovo",Two distorted Romanesque columns hold aloft a mine cart in honor of laborers who died during WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mitrovica-miners-monument,"Standing in the form of some lost Roman addition to Stonehenge, Bogdan Bogdanović’s huge concrete monument in the town of Mitrovica is actually an homage to the community’s roots and to those who were lost during the fighting of World War II. Located atop a promontory known as Miner’s Hill, Bogdanović’s stark memorial speaks to the area’s rich history of, unsurprisingly, mining. The work is another in a long line of bleak concrete memorials that Bogdanović has created across Eastern Europe to remember those who died fighting German forces. The Mitrovica monument is comprised of two fluted columns that taper near the top to create a bit of forced perspective for those viewing the work from the ground. Perched atop the spires is the curved belly of a concrete mine cart replica that speaks directly to the history of the place. The monument was specifically dedicated to the Serbian and Albanian fighters from the area, many of whom worked as miners. As with many of the cement monuments that still litter Eastern Europe and Western Russia, the meaning behind the Mitrovica miner’s monument is lost both on many of the visitors and on many of the locals to whom it is simply becoming an aging stone curiosity much like the famous henge that inspired it.",communist monuments communist architecture brutalism communism world war ii memorials monuments military statues
229,Kosovo Bill Clinton Statue,"Pristina, Kosovo",A 11-foot former president stands on a Kosovo street that also bears his name.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kosovo-bill-clinton-statue,"Helped Kosovo achieve its independence? Then you get more than just a street sign to honor your contributions to the country. If you’re former President Bill Clinton, you’ll get your very own 11-foot brass statue. Regardless of one’s political leanings, it is hard to deny that President Clinton had a heavy hand in ending the war in Bosnia, and the Kosovo War during the 1990s. So seeing the city of Prishtina, capitol of Kosovo, name its main road Bill Clinton Boulevard after the American leader is no surprise. But the huge statue they built of him seemed to surprise the man himself. When Clinton traveled to Kosovo to unveil the big, brass monument in 2009, the Daily News quoted him as saying, “I never expected that anywhere, someone would make such a big statue of me.” Considering the tarnishing his legacy underwent in America due to his sex scandal, it must have seemed somewhat refreshing. The statue stands atop a blocky, three-tiered pedestal covered in white tile, in a small urban square. No matter how tall the statue is, the replica president still seems dwarfed by the monolithic, brutalist architecture towering around him. Nonetheless it is a reminder of an important revolution in the country and the allies that had a part in it.",presidents monuments statues
230,Church of the Holy Emperor Uroš and Madhe Mosque,"Ferizaj, Kosovo","Christianity and Islam have clashed, yet here a Serbian Orthodox church and a mosque stand together.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-holy-emperor-uros-madhe-mosque,"The Balkans have seen their share of conflict and turmoil. There, for centuries, Orthodox Christians have been at odds with Muslims, and these religious identities have turned into national identities, as Serbians are predominantly Christian while Albanians, which are the majority of Kosovars, are Muslim. Yet in the small southern Kosovo municipality of Ferizaj (Albanian) or Urosevac (Serbian), one plot of land holds temples to both religions. A mosque, known as Madhe Mosque, was originally built in the 1890s, during the time of the Ottoman Empire, though is was destroyed by German bombers during World War II.  The current mosque was completedin 1943 and upgrades, including the second minaret, were completed as recently as 2013. In the late 1920s, it was decided that a Serbian Orthodox church was to be built in the same courtyard as the mosque. Later named the Church of the Holy Emperor Uroš, dedicated to Serbian emperor Uroš V. Over the years, strife and conflict took their toll on the church, including looting and fires after the beginning of the Kosovo War in 1999. Graffiti is commonly found on its walls to this day. Generally, though, the courtyard holding two seemingly conflicting ideologies goes on in peace.",balkan mosques religion churches sacred spaces
231,Gadime Cave,"Gadime e Poshtme, Kosovo",The ceiling of this cavern is dripping with multicolored marble stalactites.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gadime-cave,"This cave was discovered by accident in 1966, when a farmer in the village of Gadime e Ulët was doing excavation while preparing to build a house. It was not until ten years later in 1976 that the remarkable limestone cavern was opened to visitors. The total length of all the known corridors and channels in Gadime Cave adds up to more than 4,000 feet, but the deeper part of the cave is still unexplored. It is estimated that it may extend for another 10,000 feet. Compared to cave systems like Mammoth Cave (the longest in the world, with more than 400 miles of tunnels) or Grotte di Frasassi (the longest in Europe, with more than 20 miles of tunnels), Gadime Cave is relatively small. But it is the longest cave system in Kosovo, and offers some extraordinary geological features. One remarkable feature of the cave is that most stalactites and stalagmites are made of marble, and they grow at an average of one millimeter every 30,000 years. Estimates place the formation of the cave in the tertiary geologic period (between 66 and 2.6 million years ago). Deep fissures in the rock can be seen in the ceiling and walls of the cave, and they are due to tectonic movements and erosion. Inside Gadime Cave you’ll find some large stalactites and stalagmites, but it is the smaller ones that form interesting, colorful patterns on the ceiling, floor, and walls of the cave. Some have been broken off, especially along the main corridors, but a large number are still intact, and they are cordoned off for protection. The main concrete corridors are quite handy considering that the cave is very wet, and the silt in the cave is both sticky and slippery. There are a few natural limestone basins where water collects, and an underground lake can be found inside the cave, but the corridors do not go that far. The temperature inside the cave is relatively stable all year round, wavering between 9.6 degrees Celsius and 16 degrees Celsius.  Gadima cave can be visited independently, or as part of a guided tour. There are currently two openings sufficiently large to be used as access points to the cave, but only one is used by visitors.",marble underground geological oddities caves
232,Newborn Monument,"Pristina, Kosovo",This massive monument was unveiled the day Kosovo declared independence from Serbia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/newborn-monument,"On February 17, 2008, the government of the Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia and unveiled this monument. The original monument was bright yellow with blue banners to represent the European Union colors. “Newborn”, a single English word in a country dominated by the Albanian language, represents the birth of a new country, its positive connotations, and the potential for a modern, democratic Kosovo. At its unveiling, it was announced that the letters would be repainted annually to celebrate another year of freedom. People worked nonstop for 10 days to complete the monument so it could be unveiled on the day Kosovo formally declared independence. The 10-foot-tall, 79-foot-long monument is hard to miss, and it gained international attention as soon as it debuted. The tradition to annually repaint the monument is still going strong today. One year, the monument was repainted to represent the flags of all the countries that recognized Kosovo’s independence.  You can walk by the monument at any time.",monuments art
233,Goddess on the Throne,"Pristina, Kosovo","This stone figurine was made more than 6,000 years ago and depicts a female deity of the Neolithic Vinča culture.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goddess-on-the-throne,"The Goddess on the Throne is a terracotta statuette found in 1956 in Pristina (in modern-day Kosovo), and it is on display at Kosovo Museum. It measures 7.3 inches in height and is estimated to be 6,000 years old. The Goddess on the Throne is a fine example of Vinča art, and there is no doubt that it was inspired by one of the culture’s deities. Vinča culture developed in Southeastern Europe during the Neolithic era, which started with the beginning of agriculture and ended in about 2,300 B.C., when the use of bronze began to spread. One striking discovery made by archaeologists is that Vinča society was far more complex and advanced than it was initially postulated. One of the signs that points to this conclusion are the unearthing of identical figurines, indicating that they had been produced in a proto-industrial fashion unbecoming of Neolithic society. The Goddess on the Throne is an exceedingly well-preserved statuette. Similar, but less well-preserved figures are on display at Kosovo Museum. The Goddess on the Throne and these other figurines do not exhibit obvious or exaggerated female physical traits as other statuettes of that period. In their place, what stands out are the odd-shaped heads. Angular and vaguely anthropomorphic, these heads may call to mind stereotypical depictions of extra-terrestrials. Additionally, the unexpected level of complexity and advancement of the Vinča society has convinced some that such a massive leap forward in human progress could only be explained by the intervention of a benevolent extra-terrestrial entity. The Goddess on the Throne has become the symbol of Pristina, and a stylized representation of the Goddess on the Throne has been adopted as the logo of the Kosovo Museum.",statues history & culture museums
234,Narcis Hotel,"Štrpce, Kosovo","As of 2022, the 124 rooms of Kosovo ski resort remain empty.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/narcis-hotel,"Running along the Kosovo/North Macedonia border, the Šar Mountains offer the best opportunities for skiing in Kosovo. The Brezovica ski resort has been the most prominent center for winter sports in this area since 1954, but infrastructures supporting winter tourism have been neglected over the past 20 years—some would claim for much longer. A glimmer of hope that the area may undergo re-development work surfaced in 2014, but it quickly evaporated due to lack of funds. The high expectations undergirding the establishment of the Brezovica ski resort and the uncertainty around its future are two vastly divergent sets of ideas that intersect in the empty corridors of abandoned hotels in and around Brezovica. Narcis Hotel is by far the most conspicuous example of this state of affairs. With its imposing center block and two sloping wings evoking ski runs, Narcis Hotel is still the unmissable landmark that it was in 1973, when it first opened its doors to Yugoslavian skiers. However, unlike the polished image that Narcis Hotel once had, nowadays its exterior is neglected, and its iconic sign is in ruin. No one but the guards are to be seen on site, which explains why all the doors and windows are intact, and the hotel has not been broken in. If the situation for many a hotel in the area is grim, Narcis Hotel faces an additional difficulty, namely being located in the village of Strpce. In fact, the majority of inhabitants in Strpce are of Serbian origins, while the remaining population is made up of Kosovars. This resulted in businesses in the hands of ethnic Serbs being boycotted by tourists of Kosovar ethnicity. Following Kosovo’s declaration of independence in 2008 the situation worsened, and Narcis Hotel’s rate of occupancy fell to 5 percent. This was an untenable situation, and the managers had to make the drastic but inevitable decision to close down. Future prospects are equally bleak, as the ethnic makeup of the village makes the location highly volatile and unlikely to attract investors.",hotels abandoned architecture
235,Memorial Complex Adem Jashari,"Prekaz, Kosovo",The site where the leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army was killed is now a memorial.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memorial-complex-adem-jashari,"History books of the Balkans are peppered with accounts of conflict between the Albanian and the Serbian ethnicities. Unsurprisingly, words such as occupation or liberation are deployed regularly to describe the same events, depending on who is narrating. One such event is the recent Kosovo War, which started in February 1998 and ended in June 1999. The two main entities involved in the conflict were the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the Serbian side, and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) on the Albanian side, with the latter trying to undermine the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s hold on Kosovo. Adem Jashari was one of the key founders of KLA. Jashari was born in 1955 in the village of Prekaz, which belongs to a region inhabited predominantly by ethnic Albanians while the territory was within the borders of Yugoslavia. In 1991, Jashari participated in an uprising against the Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo, and KLA was founded. Shortly after this, Jashari moved to Albania for military training. Upon his return to his hometown, he resumed his activities against the Yugoslav authorities, which eventually led to the Yugoslav forces surrounding his compound on March 5, 1998. More than 60 people were inside the compound, and they included many women and children. By the end of the battle, 28 militants and 30 civilians were killed. Among the militants was Adem Jashari, and most of the civilians that were killed were members of Jashari’s family. This was a turning point that marked the beginning of the Kosovo War.  An unintended consequence of the massacre of Prekaz was KLA’s immediate rise in popularity and respect among the Albanian communities and beyond. Most of the international community turned against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and eventually NATO got involved in the conflict. The Memorial Complex Adem Jashari consists of a garden, a museum, and two buildings. The garden is where the graves of the soldiers that died in the conflict can be found, constantly guarded by soldiers of the Kosovo Security Force (KSF).  The museum displays everyday objects that belonged to those who died during the clash on March 5, 1998, including the AK47 that Adem Jashari used on that fateful day. The two buildings belong to the compound where the fighting took place, and they are riddled with bullet holes and bigger cracks caused by heavy artillery.  These two buildings are surrounded by scaffolding so that visitors can appreciate the level of destruction caused by the battle without actually touching the buildings. Several other buildings in Prekaz village and the surrounding countryside bear the scars of this battle.",war history memorials history & culture museums
236,Ura e Terzive,"Bishtazhin, Kosovo",This 15th-century Ottoman bridge was modified to keep up with the changing course of the river Erenik.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ura-e-terzive,"Ura e Terzive is an Ottoman stone bridge originally built in the 15th century in the proximity of the village of Bishtazhin, on the merchant route linking Turkey to Albania. It averages 3.5 meters in width, making it a one-lane bridge, even though nowadays it is rarely used, and only by pedestrians. Its 11 arches and 10 niches extend for over 190 meters, some of which span the river Erenik. In fact, the length of the bridge vastly exceeds that of the river.  This is due to changes in the course of the river Erenik through time, and the building of additional arches as a result. The current structure of the bridge came about from modifications made during the 18th century, while its polished appearance is due to restoration work carried out between 1982 and 1984. Apart from its historical importance, one interesting thing about Ura e Terzive is the inscriptions and drawings carved into its stones. Among the drawings are two pots or jars, and the Star of David. A Turkish inscription on the bridge testifies that the construction of the original bridge was commissioned by the Tailors’ Guild. This is why Ura e Terzive is locally referred to as the Tailors’ Bridge. By facilitating travels between the cities of Gjakova and Prizren, Ura e Terzive boosted local commerce and acquired utmost strategic importance. Nowadays, a new road connecting the two cities is located a few meters north of the bridge, making it, for all intents and purposes, a monument rather than a functional bridge.",rivers infrastructure bridges
