0,Ithaa Undersea Restaurant,"Rangalifinolhu, Maldives","An underwater restaurant, surrounded by a coral reef.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ithaa-undersea-restaurant,"To enter the restaurant, visitors climb down a spiral staircase in a thatched pavilion at the end of a jetty. They enter the building, which has a curved roof like a tunnel, from above. Secured five meters below sea level at the Hilton Maldives Resort and Spa, the Ithaa Undersea Restaurant is a mostly acrylic building that only seats 14. Offering a 270-degree panoramic view to its customers, Ithaa was designed and constructed by M.J. Murphy Ltd., a design consultancy based in New Zealand. Opened in 2005, Ithaa (which means ‘mother of pearl’ in Dhivehi, the local language) charges a premium for its meals, but they might cost less than one would expect for an underwater dinner. They start in price at about $120 US for lunch for hotel guests. The restaurant serves contemporary fusion Maldivian cuisine with Western and Asian influences. Advance reservations are necessary. Designed by the Kuala Lumpur National Science Center, the building qualifies as the world’s largest aquarium tunnel. After completion in 2004, Ithaa was taken to the Maldives on the back of an ocean-going barge. It took 16 days to arrive. It is estimated that the restaurant, which is placed in extreme conditions, will only last for 20 years.",1 Hour Sea Plane from Male International Airport
1,Sea of Stars,"Vaadhoo, Maldives",Bioluminescence in the reefs of the Maldives causes the sea to glow like a starry night sky.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sea-of-stars,"The “Sea of Stars” is a beautiful phenomenon that occurs during late summer in the reefs of the Maldives, caused by bioluminescent phytoplankton called Lingulodinium polyedrum. The water here is filled with this plankton, and the movement of the waves causes it to glow, creating an incredible shimmering effect that looks like the sea is full of stars.","Vaadhoo Island in the Raa Atoll is the most well-known spot for viewing the plankton, though it is dependant on conditions and may occur on any of the islands. It is best to do more research if you are interested."
2,Subsix,"Kudahuvadhoo, Maldives",Fine dining 20 feet below the surface in the Indian Ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/subsix,"At the uber fancy PER AQUUM Niyama resort in Maldives, tourists frolic between two private islands. They have lots of dining choices, but by far the most unique is Subsix, a gourmet restaurant six (hence the name) meters (about 20 feet) beneath the surface of the Indian Ocean. In order to even see Subsix, visitors must come by speedboat. It’s a 40 minute trip from the capital, Malé, or a 15 minute one from Niyama Resort’s islands. The entrance to the restaurant is inconspicuous, just a mysterious pair of doors atop a short dock. Once there, they descend three stories beneath the waves into the “clam-shaped” bar. The building (constructed on land then sunk below the waves) sits central to a thriving coral reef. Sea anemone chairs and soft blue light invite the diners into the ocean world, not to mention the Hawkbill turtles, eels, and parrotfish swimming just beyond the glass.",
3,Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve,"Eydhafushi, Maldives",The world's seventh-largest coral reef contains an incredible amount of biodiversity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baa-atoll-biosphere-reserve,"This highly biodiverse environment is home to the world’s seventh largest coral reef. Huge quantities of plankton flow through it, which enables the whole food chain to thrive. More than 250 types of corals are found in the Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve, sustaining about 1,200 species of fish. Baa Atoll refers to three distinct atolls that form a wider ring of islands covering a total area of 345,206 acres (139,700 hectares). Of the 75 islands in the Baa Atoll, 13 are inhabited by Maldivians, some are resort islands (where there is one tourist resort on the whole island), and the rest are uninhabited. The waters of the atoll vary in depth from 98 to 263 feet (30 to 80 meters), whereas around the atoll, the ocean plummets to more than 250 metres in depth. Look in the water, and you’ll likely spot parrot-fish, butterfly-fish, angel-fish, clown-fish, wrasses, marine turtles, moray eels, manta rays, groupers, whale sharks, and dolphins. Some threatened and endangered species found in the waters of the atoll include green turtles, hawksbill turtles, Napoleon wrasses, and tawny nurse sharks. The astonishing degree of biodiversity of the Baa Atoll extends also to above-water flora and fauna. Mangroves are present on virtually all islands, and among the most common animals are several types of lizards, skinks and geckos, fruit bats, frigate birds, and herons. The government has made a commitment to environmental protection, with a particular emphasis on recycling, which has led to the export of recyclable waste becoming a thriving business in recent years, second only to the export of fish.","Baa Atoll can be reached by ferry boats from Malé. Alternatively, there are frequent daily flights between the Island of Dharavandhoo and Malé. From Dharavandhoo, other islands can be reached by boat. The GPS coordinates for this place entry lead to the Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve Office on the island of Eydhafushi. Scuba diving indubitably increases the number of marine creatures you may encounter but it is not a requirement. Snorkeling in waters up to 16 feet (five meters) in depth is sufficient to see more species than you can name. The environmental impact of your visit also depends on the type of accommodation you choose. In this regard, islands develop their own waste management system that must comply with local regulations, which emphasise self-reliance and sustainability. Although official inspections are rare, some islands have taken environmentally friendly practices seriously. Some research before visiting is required, but it is possible to visit the Baa Atoll with minimal environmental impact. As mentioned, some islands are entirely dedicated to tourism, with one resort being the only structure on the whole island. The range of these resorts can vary, from gaudy to luxurious. For a more authentic experience, accommodation can also be found on the islands inhabited by Maldivians. This imposes some restrictions, such as dressing modestly in the villages, no alcohol, and limited nightlife."
4,"Thilafushi: the ""Rubbish Island""","Malé, Maldives",The exorbitant price of paradise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thilasfushi-the-rubbish-island,"The Maldives island chain in the Indian Ocean is about as close as it gets to tropical bliss on Earth. The smooth white sand, tranquil blue water, and beautiful foliage annually attracts 750,000 visitors a year. But unbeknownst to most of these tourists, for decades the rubbish they produced - 3.5 kg per day - was being ditched on a floating, heaping pile of trash. In the beginning, Thilafushi was a lagoon composed of shallow coral reefs. In 1992, the Malé government decided to use the barrier island as the final destination for the enormous waste produced by their flourishing tourism industry. “Rubbish Island” as it was called, began receiving visitors in the form of massive refuse freighters, garbage excavators and migrant workers paid to handle the trash. For 20 some odd years, the man-made “island” was presented with approximately 330 tons of garbage a day, causing it to swell at a rate of one square meter every 24 hours. The newly-generated land was soon leased to entrepreneurs who used the island for various industrial activities. The island has of course suffered from the haphazard waste. The outrageous number of flies is a disgusting addition to the area, but isn’t the island’s biggest problem. Commercial activity along with indiscriminate dumping has brought an abundance of toxic materials to the lagoon - broken oil drums, asbestos, lead, and other noxious metals mix in with daily household garbage items creating a noxious sludge. There is little around the island that goes unpolluted as harmful substances seep into the water and smoke from burning waste floods the air. The government outlawed rubbish dumping on the island in 2011 after several freighters, impatient with the dumping process, jettisoned their loads directly into the sea. Garbage boats are reportedly now advised to shuttle their merchandise to India.",
5,Dhigurashu Thun'di (Long Beach),"Dhigurah, Maldives","A narrow, serpentine spit of sand is constantly eroded and rebuilt by competing currents.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dhigurashu-thundi-long-beach-maldives,"Indian flying foxes—one of the largest bat species in the world—flit from one breadfruit tree to the next, their wings silent above the rhythm of the surf. Here on the island of Dhigurah, a narrow slice of sand and coral in the Maldives’ Alifu Dhaalu Atoll, about two hours by public speedboat from the capital of Malé, the ocean is always nearby. At its widest point, Dhigurah is only 300 meters across, though most of it is much narrower. Its slender shape—Dhigurah means “long island” in Dhivehi—is most dramatic at its southwest end, a sand spit that stretches for hundreds of meters between the atoll lagoon and the open Indian Ocean. Ocean and lagoon waves constantly compete to erode and rebuild the thin, serpentine sandbar, known as Dhigurashu Thun’di, or Long Beach. Yet the water on either side of the spit is surprisingly calm. It’s not unusual to see local children splashing in the waves while their parents set out a picnic nearby. About 600 people live on the island, and the spit is a popular destination for villagers at all times of day. A thin strip of tropical forest thick with palm and breadfruit trees offers shade from the midday sun. At sunset, sand and sky turn dramatic shades of red and orange as the lights of small fishing boats wink on in the gathering darkness. Just beyond the spit, waves crash together, hinting at the powerful forces in motion beneath the surface. Even then, at low tides on calm days, it’s theoretically possible to cross from the sand spit to another sandbar that leads to a small island, home to a luxury resort—though a no-trespassing sign warns you against doing so. The Maldives began welcoming tourists in 1972, and for most of that period, visiting meant flying into the capital of Malé and being whisked by chartered seaplane or private speedboat to a high-end resort island that was off-limits to locals. Since 2009, however, several “local islands,” dotted with guesthouses and small hotels, have opened to foreign tourists. On these islands, including Dhigurah, alcohol is banned and adhan, the Islamic call to prayer, echoes across the sand several times a day. Dhigurah is located close to several nearshore sites popular with whale sharks and manta rays year-round, drawing a growing number of foreigners eager to snorkel or dive with the animals. But Dhigurashu Thun’di remains a quiet, calm place of stunning beauty shared by locals and visitors alike, a slim line of white sand curving between a turquoise lagoon and the open ocean.","Dhigurashu Thun'di is accessible by foot from the island's village in about half an hour. Walking along the northwest-facing beach requires some wading. Reaching it via the southeast beach is not recommended due to the rocky coast and stronger currents. You can also reach the spit by following the island's ""Beach Trail,"" actually an unpaved road through the jungle. The road is used by villagers to access community gardens and the island's garbage collection site, so expect to yield to motorbikes and ""Cool Rides,"" a popular local vehicle that's half motorized tricycle, half mini-pickup. Unlike at the so-called ""Bikini Beach"" for tourists on the island's north side, modest attire is appropriate for Dhigurashu Thun'di, which is very popular with local families. Everyone visiting the Long Beach should be covered from shoulders and upper arms to knees."
6,Dharavandhoo Fish Market,"Dharavandhoo, Maldives","When the sun sets, the customers arrive—but they’re not human.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dharavandhoo-fish-market,"A small, open-air concrete building sits beside a palm tree at the east edge of Dharavandhoo’s pocket-sized harbor. A sign announces it as the island’s fish market, but it’s nothing like the bustling trade halls of Tokyo’s Toyosu or Seattle’s touristy Pike Place. Here, no money changes hands, and the diverse customers take whatever they’re offered, no haggling necessary. “Reef sharks, stingrays, sometimes nurse sharks up to three meters long,” says Ahmed Mahzoom, listing the fish that gather in the water at the harbor wall’s base. Mahzoom works at one of the handful of modest hotels and guesthouses on the tiny island, which is part of the Maldives’ Baa Atoll and home to about 800 people. From May to November, Dharavandhoo is a hub for tourists eager to see massive gatherings of manta rays in nearby Hanifaru Bay. It’s also popular year-round with divers and snorkelers in search of octopuses, moray eels, turtles, and more. But at the Dharavandhoo Fish Market, the fish come to you. In late afternoon, families gather along the harbor wall behind the market building, often grandparents with teens and children in tow. They handline fish, unspooling line from around a repurposed plastic bottle and tossing baited hooks from the wall’s concrete edge. If something bites, the fisher brings the line in, quickly wrapping it around the bottle, while their assistant waits with a net. Groupers, jacks, and other meaty reef fish are kept, but slender cornetfish and smaller species get thrown back. As daylight fades, the fishers and their families carry buckets with their catch into the market building, a tidy place with rows of filleting stations, sinks, and pump bottles of hand sanitizer. Meanwhile, the fish market’s customers gather outside. The sandy bottom and bright harbor lights make it easy to see the arrivals: one, then two, then six stingrays on this night, circling patiently just below the surface. Cowtail stingrays and paler porcupine rays glide around and over each other in a slow ballet of patience as they wait for dinner. A heron, also interested in what’s on the menu, perches on a nearby jetty. As the fishers gut their catch and toss the remains back into the water, the rays take turns surfacing, snacking, and then circling back to the end of the line in hopes of more morsels. The stretch of water illuminated by the harbor lights turns into a synchronized swimming performance. Even when sharks show up, locals say it’s an orderly affair. Night falls as the fishers prep the last of the day’s catch and pack it up to take home. The final handful of tails and innards is thrown into the water and a waiting ray takes it with barely a ripple. As the families leave the fish market, so do the rays, swimming into the darker waters beyond the harbor’s glow.",
7,Khustain Nuruu National Park,Mongolia,The grassy landscape is home to the world's last truly wild horses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khustain-nuruu-national-park,"One of the great comebacks of the 1990s took place not on the silver screen or the sports field, but in the grasslands of Mongolia. The takhi wild horses native to the grassy steppes had vanished from the wild in the 1970s, but as a result of various breeding programs, they slowly reappeared in their old stomping grounds, including their original home: the Khustain Nuruu national park. The takhi (officially named Przewalski’s horse after the Russian explorer who first spotted it), may be the world’s last truly wild horse. While most “wild” horses around the globe are domesticated horses gone feral, the Przewalski’s horse was never domesticated. Up until the 18th century, these short stocky horses freely roamed the steppes of Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russian Siberia. But then the numbers started dwindling. In 1967, the last herd of takhi was spotted and in 1969, the last individual horse. They were declared “extinct in the wild,” which remained the status quo for nearly 30 years. There were only 13 surviving takhi horses, kept in different zoos around the world. They were bred carefully, and the population slowly increased to more than 1,500 at which point they were reintroduced into the wild. The downside of this method is that the genetic pool of all the existing horses is limited. One of the places where the reintroduction took place in 1992 was the horse’s native habitat of Khustain Nuruu or Hustai National Park. A year later the park, which stretches across 50,000 hectares, was declared as a Specially Protected Area. Its key mission is to maintain and build a sustainable population of these rare creatures. Visitors to the park can now spot teams of dun-colored horses wandering around the dry grassy landscape. Although the star of Khustain Nuruu is indubitably the takhi, the park is also home to other species like the red deer, steppe gazelle, the Eurasian badger, grey wolves, and the Eurasian lynx.","Khustain National Park is located 60 miles west of Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian capital city. Public transport can drop the occasional visitor nearby the park, but a private car would certainly come in handy given the size of the park. Accommodation can be found inside the park itself, but several camps are scattered throughout the area."
8,Genghis Khan Statue Complex,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",Enormous statue of the Emperor of the Mongols.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/genghis-khan-equestrian-statue,"To most of the world, Genghis Khan is known as a brutal and savage dictator, whose campaigns of terror and wholesale massacre of civilian populations may have resulted in the deaths of up to forty million people. But to the people of Mongolia, he is revered as a national hero, ruling over the largest contiguous empire in history and establishing the Mongols as a political and cultural force. Despite being represented on dozens of statues and appearing on everything from bottles of liquor to cigarette packets, it seems that the public’s appetite for more has not yet waned. In 2008, a giant statue of Khan riding a horse was erected fifty-four kilometers from the capital Ulaanbaatar. At forty meters high, it is the world’s largest equestrian statue and stands more than double the height of the previous record holder in Uruguay. Made from two hundred and fifty tons of stainless steel, it reputedly cost $4.1 million to construct. At the base of the statue, visitors can visit an archaeological museum, try on traditional Mongolian costumes, tour the numerous portraits of the Khan lineage, or try the cuisine at the restaurant on the second floor before taking an elevator to to the top of the horse’s head, where they are greeted with a panoramic view over the surrounding landscape. The foundation building, designed to look like European Gothic style architecture, symbolizes that Genghis Khan is standing on Europe after his successful military campaigns, and he is returning East, his home country. If you stretch your eyes to the East, you will see a small statue of his mother greeting him.",The statue is located 54 kilometers from the capital city Ulaanbaatar. This place is also famous for its photo spot with wild birds. Visitors can take a picture with a golden eagle or vulture on their hand.
9,Erdene Zuu,"Kharkhorin, Mongolia","The oldest Buddhist monastery in Mongolia has survived centuries of invasions, political shifts, and religious purges.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erdene-zuu,"The establishment of Erdene Zuu dates at least to 1585, and some posit it goes back much further, as far as the 8th century. It is the oldest surviving Buddhist monastery in Mongolia. The name translated means “100 Treasures,” a nod to the number of original temples and the chain of stupas (mounded reliquaries) that form the exterior walls of the sacred site. Tangled in its legacy, there are the scars of centuries of fighting across those sacred walls. The history of Erdene Zuu is a mix of invasions, religious purges, political shifts, and outright murder. Damaged and dismantled in 1688 during a conflict between Dzungars (a confederation of Mongolian tribes) and Khalkha Mongols (historically ruled by the Khans), what remained of the monastery was reassembled in the 18th century. Again, in 1939, the order suffered a blow at the hands of Khorloogiin Choibalsan, the Communist leader of Mongolia, who ordered the destruction of scores of temples and the slaughter of thousands of monks throughout the country. All that remained of Erdene Zuu were three temples and a small order, with nearly one hundred structures destroyed and an estimated one thousand members either murdered or imprisoned. It was either sheer luck or the twisted wisdom of Stalin that saved the site from total destruction, kept as a token of “religious tolerance” to be put on display for international visitors, including U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace during a trip in the late 1940s. Intervention by the Soviet leader convinced the Mongolian regime to spare the monastery, a move motivated less by goodwill than by political pretense. But tolerance under Stalin and Khorloogiin Choibalsan only went so far, and the monastery was forced to convert into a museum. It remained in this religious limbo until the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviets and reversion of the site to the lamas. It still wears both hats today, and the wall of 108 stupas that surround the compound, clearly visible from a mile away, are in a good state of repair. Inside there are several temples and additional stupas, the oldest dating to 1799.  One particular area of historic destruction by the Communists is cordoned off, but its foundations are still visible. There are plans to rebuild, but work has yet to begin. Erdene Zuu, after so many centuries of sheer will to survive, will get that work done.","Part of the Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape World Heritage Site, the monastery is in central Mongolia, about a quarter mile northeast of the center of Kharkhorin."
10,The Zaisan Memorial,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",A huge communist-era propaganda monument and mural that offers stunning views of the Mongolian capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-zaisan-memorial-ulaanbaatar-mongolia,"In many ways, the Zaisan Memorial is a massive show of appreciation for the Soviet Union, from the Mongolian people. Seeming to promote good relations between the two states, the monument was actually created by the Soviet Union to depict just how much they had done for the lowly eastern communist state. Located on a hill south of the city, the monument features a circular memorial painting that depicts scenes of friendship between the peoples of the USSR and Mongolia. Ostensibly built to commemorate Soviet soldiers in World War II, the sprawling mural also illustrates the defeat of the Japanese in 1939, which brought Mongolia into the Soviet sphere of influence. Of course the victory over Nazi Germany, a battle that subsumed Mongolian troops into the Red Army, is also prominently featured. In 2003, a tank memorial, featuring a Soviet tank from a brigade paid for by the Mongolian people, was moved to the foot of the hill. The tank memorial includes a map showing the route the brigade took from Moscow in 1943 for participation in the fall of Berlin in 1945. From the bottom of the hill, visitors can choose to make the climb of more than five hundred steps in order to reach the monument and mural. Those who make the climb receive a reward of a spectacular panoramic view of Ulaanbaatar, the surrounding mountains and the Tuul river.","From Ulaanbaatar, look south and the huge monument will guide you."
11,International Intellectual and Puzzle Museum,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia","An institution dedicated to curiosity, logic, riddles, and Mongolia's long history of puzzles.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/international-intellectual-museum,"Mongolia has a history of puzzle-crafting, and has created some of the world’s most difficult puzzles and chess sets. Shatar, a Mongolian version of chess, dates back to the Middle Ages, while more modern burr puzzles (made from interlocking pieces of wood) can be traced back throughout the 1900s. Mongolia’s enigmatic history is honored at the International Intellectual Puzzle Museum, or the IQ Museum for short. The museum is the creation of Tumen Ulzii, who was born to nomadic herders and would have followed that path had he not fallen in love with logic puzzles at an early age. His father gave him a six-piece burr puzzle with one piece missing. After he solved the problem of the missing piece he began creating his own puzzles, eventually founding a company to manufacture logic games for the youth of Mongolia and a museum to showcase puzzle and logic history. Ulzii’s work has not gone unrecognized—he has been awarded the prizes for “Best Inventor in Mongolia” and “Meritorious Person of Culture.” The museum displays some puzzles created by Ulzii himself, as well as rare and precious puzzles from around the world. Over 5,000 toys, puzzles, and games are on view, most of which visitors are invited to fiddle with. Ulzii’s inventions are usually wooden, the pieces carved into whimsical Disney characters and animals of the zodiac. Some even depict figures from Mongolian history, like Genghis Khan. The simplest are the traditional six-piece models, but some puzzles in the museum include as many as 350 pieces. There are also various puzzles made from gold, precious stones, and silver. One turtle-shaped puzzle offers a prize of $100,000 if solved within a specific timeframe. In the museum’s three decades of operation, no one has ever solved it. Mongolian chess, another of Ulzii’s passions, is also featured in the IQ Museum’s exhibits. Masterful woodcarving, a skill essential to crafting the intricate puzzles, is also exhibited at the museum in the traditional furniture which decorates the space. The purpose of the museum is not just to catalogue the history of puzzles in Mongolia, but to remind visitors that curiosity and play are an important part of training the brain. Visitors to the museum are guided by a docent who performs magic tricks, watches you struggle with the puzzles, and reveals their solutions to you in a matter of seconds.",No photos are allowed inside the museum apart from one display at the end. Open your mind to the challenge of games and puzzles and enjoy the fun and beautiful craftsmanship of the exhibits.
12,Khamriin Khiid,"Urgun, Mongolia",Mongolian Buddhists believe this monastery in the Gobi desert to be the center of the world's spiritual energy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khamriin-khiid,"According to Mongolian Buddhism, a spot in the middle of the Gobi desert is where the strongest spiritual energy in the world converges. To mark the location, the monastery complex was built in the 19th century, Khamriin Khiid. The original Khamriin Khiid monastery was founded in 1820 by Danzanravjaa, known as the Terrible Noble Saint of the Gobi, who observed the location’s tremendous energy. At its peak, the monastery housed up to 500 monks, and included more than 80 temples within the complex. Danzanravjaa was a great scholar and practitioner of the arts, as well as a social reformer. He set up a theater at the monastery for people to develop their singing and acting skills, and a public school, which encouraged education for both men and women. The lively and productive monastery was destroyed in 1937, in the wake of the Communist purge against religions, and Khamriin Khiid in its current form was reconstructed in 1990. Today, hundreds of pilgrims visit the site every day at dawn to benefit from the spiritual energy that is believed to radiate as a new day is born. Shambala, the centerpiece of the complex, is surrounded by 108 stupas, encircling other holy monuments and temples, the most prominent of which has a large pair of eyes staring at visitors. The enclosed space is said to be warmer due to the energy that emanates from Shambala, and it is not uncommon to see pilgrims taking off their shoes to better absorb the energy. Another form of worship is the throwing of rice, millet, milk and vodka on monuments. Other visitors walk around singing a song composed for Khamriin Khiid. Outside the enclosure are the series of caves where Danzanravjaa and other monks meditated for 108 days, two huge breast-shaped mounds covered in milk, a wind-activated bell, and the actual monastery.",
13,The Mother Tree,"Shammar, Mongolia",This spiritual landmark for practicers of Shamanism is drenched in milk and vodka and covered in blue scarves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mother-tree-shammar-mongolia,"Although Buddhism is the most widespread practiced religion in Mongolia, Shamanism is alive and well. Often, the two religions blend into one, and landmarks throughout Mongolia testify to this. The Eej Mod or “Mother Tree” in Shaamar is one stand-out example. Its fame spread beyond Mongolia and worshippers from Japan, Korea, and China  come from afar to pay homage to the Mother Tree. Those who practice Shamanism believe that shamans communicate between the human and spiritual worlds, and the Mother Tree became seen as a gateway to the spirits after it was struck by lightning. Now worshipers will travel to the tree to make an offering in hopes of having their prayers answered. Until 2015, the Mother Tree was an actual tree, around which a ger (aka yurt) had been built. Following a practice that thousands of others had engaged in before, one worshipper in 2015 lit an incense stick by the tree, but this time the tree caught fire, and it was all but destroyed.  The stump was salvaged from the fire and placed in the outside compound. Today, the ger is still in its place, and the ground where the Mother Tree once grew is the object of people’s veneration. The stump, alongside a number of nearby trees, is shrouded in ceremonial scarves, mostly blue, and drenched in milk and vodka. The fence around the compound is “fortified” by tea bricks.  In an adjacent compound, another tree has been elevated to the status of Holy Tree in recent years by an eminent Mongolia shaman.","Along the main road running through Shaamar, there is a sign saying Eej Mod (in Mongolian script) pointing left (heading north). There is no well defined road, but tracks going off road are visible at the sign. The Mother Tree is a couple of kilometres along those tracks."
14,Flaming Cliffs,"Bulgan, Mongolia",Dinosaur eggs were first discovered at these fiery red cliffs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flaming-cliffs,"In the evening, these desert cliffs glow with a fiery red light that seems to mimic the radiance of the setting sun. The cliffs are best seen from below or across the escarpment. But no matter where you stand or what time you visit, you can still witness the breathtaking magnitude and raw beauty of the place come to life. The local geology is just as captivating as the cliff’s blazing light show. This landscape within the Gobi Desert is arguably among the most important sites for dinosaur fossil hunters, and research around the cliffs has proven to be particularly fruitful. Dinosaur eggs were first discovered in this area in the 1920s, and a fossil of a Protoceratops and a Velociraptor locked in a fight were unearthed in the 1970s. To date, paleontologists are finding important fossils in the surrounding area. The Flaming Cliffs are a prime example of what’s known as a Djadochta Formation, layers of sand and calcareous matter. Even by geological standards, the cliffs are an ancient formation, with the best estimates clocking their birth at 71 to 75 million years ago. Another fun fact: The Flaming Cliffs are also called Bayanzag, which means “rich in saxaul,” one of the few plants that can survive the extremes of the Gobi: extremely cold, extremely hot, and extremely arid. Saxaul is a thorny shrub that is better left untouched. Camels, however, seem partial to it.","The roughly 60-mile dirt track from Dalanzadgad is compacted rocky desert that makes for an exceptionally smooth ride. Signs, however, are few and far between. It is best to go with someone who knows the area or to ask for directions along the way, even if you think you’re on the right track. Although it’s not uninhabited, it is still a desert, and the risks that this implies should not be underestimated."
15,Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",An exceptional assortment of fossils recovered from private collections.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-museum-of-mongolian-dinosaurs,"The Gobi Desert on the Mongolia-China border is a beautifully desolate area, but millions of years ago, when dinosaurs roamed, it teemed with life. That combination makes it a world-class source of fossils. It’s the type of place where you can find protoceratops skulls, dinosaur eggs, and a full skeleton of Tarbosaurus bataar, all of which are on display at this museum in Ulaanbaatar. While the museum itself is a bit shabby and rarely appears on Ulaanbaatar itineraries, it holds some real paleontological gems within its walls. Its openly mounted skeletons of original fossils rather than cast copies are a rare sight to behold. The first sight past the ticket booth is a showstopper: the dramatically lit Tarbosaurus bataar skeleton, which closely resembles a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the famed North American predator. Another room (of three) contains a full skeleton of an oviraptor, which stood at a height equivalent to a human’s chest. Perhaps even more incredible than its collection is the museum’s origin story. While Mongolia is a treasure trove of dinosaur fossils, the country’s riches have long been smuggled beyond its borders. This was the case for the museum’s entire collection, until foreign courts mandated their return. The judgment of an American court to hand over the Tarbosaurus bataar skeleton in a case launched by Mongolia’s president prompted the museum’s founding. Another case made headlines when Nicolas Cage returned a Tarbosaurus bataar skull he had bought years earlier (the American actor was not accused of wrongdoing). These successes have spurred more repatriation efforts and investments. So while it may be some time until live stegosauruses wander an amusement park, a shiny future for Mongolian paleontology appears within reach.","Displays in Mongolian and English explain each specimen and offer informational tidbits, such as why it's entirely reasonable to ask if dinosaurs had feathers. A local, English-speaking guide is usually on hand as well. The museum is open everyday from 10 to 7 (summer) or 9 to 6 (winter), even during holidays such as Naadam. Look for a giant depiction of a dinosaur erupting from the building's facade. That is the side entrance—walk clockwise to the front door."
16,Ovoos at Terkhiin Tsagaan Lake,"Tariat, Mongolia",A jagged silhouette of shamanistic stone heaps rises from the shore of this dazzling mile-high lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ovoos-at-terkhiin-tsagaan-lake,"Terkhiin Tsagaan Lake is one of the most dazzling in Mongolia, sitting a mile and a quarter (2,060 m) above sea level. On the northeast shore you can see a dramatic and jagged silhouette against the azure sky, made by shamanistic heaps of stones called “ovoos.” Ovoos are found on many high peaks throughout Mongolia, and according to tradition, when someone approaches he or she is to circle it three times (always clockwise), and then add a few rocks to the ever-reaching pile. Over time they grow, often to impressive heights, some as high as 10 feet (3 m). Terkhiin Tsagaan is also known as White Lake, due to the thick layer of snow sitting on its frozen surface for the better part of the year. Local legend says that the lake was created by a giant tossing a rock that made an enormous hole on landing, but the more down-to-earth explanation goes back thousands of years, and an eruption of the nearby Khorgo Volcano. This geological history is partly what makes the Terkhiin Tsagaan Lake ovoos stand out: They are made by using the black lava rocks that pepper the surrounding terrain. This, and the sheer number of them—in all, hundreds have been ritualistically created, making for a singular and eerie landscape.","Terkhiin-Tsagaan is in west-central Mongolia, and the easiest way of accessing the lake is by following a dirt road from Khorgo Volcano. This leads to the north-east shore of the lake, where the ovoos can be found."
17,Taikhar Rock,"Battsengel, Mongolia","People have been scribbling on this massive chunk of granite for more than 1,500 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taikhar-rock,"Taikhar Chuluu (Taikhar Rock) is a 66-foot high granite block set in the middle of a huge expanse of flatland and rolling hills. Strangely, its shape and unusual location aren’t its most fascinating features. The rock has 150 writings etched all over its surface. The scrawled sentiments cover the rock from top to bottom. The most ancient of these writings are in Turkic languages and date back to the 6th century AD. You’ll find words jotted down in other languages, too, like Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese. The inscriptions are proof that Taikhar Rock has been an important site for more than 1,500 years. Adding new writings is a tradition that continues to this day, though most of the current inscriptions seem to mainly be about political slogans or declarations of eternal love. An oovo (a heap of sacred stones) was placed on top to reassert the religious significance of this site. There are two radically different explanations for the rock’s unusual appearance—one mystical, one scientific. According to one account, a mythical giant named Bukhbilegt used this looming chunk of granite to plug a hole in the ground once frequented by a gargantuan snake. But according to a more plausible theory, Taikhar Rock is the result of the nearby river eroding the granite mountains and flooding the area over millions of years.",
18,Imperial Map Monument,"Harhorin, Mongolia","History, geography, and shamanism meet in this eye-catching monument to the greatness of three empires.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/imperial-map-monument,"Imperial Map Monument commemorates the three empires that settled on the shore of the nearby Orkhon River. Also known as King’s Monument and Monument for the Mongol States, it was built in 2004 on a hill overlooking the town of Kharkhorin. The monument consists of a large pile of stones (a shamanic ovoo) carefully assembled in the shape of a cone, approximately the same size as a tepee, with nine poles protruding from the top. This structure is mounted on a stone-and-concrete platform, and it is surrounded by three walls representing three sections of a circle. The outer sides of these walls feature three colorful mosaics depicting three maps, one for each of the empires. First, there was the Xiongnu Empire, a confederation of nomadic tribes living in the steppes from around the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE. The Turkic Khaganate Empire followed, established by the Göktürks in 682 and lasting only until 744. Finally, and famously, Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries. The Mongol Empire’s iconic place in the culture, combined with the shamanic symbolism of the ovoo in the center of the monument, entice people to leave offerings of vodka, milk, tea, rice, and other edible titbits that inevitably attract birds and the occasional herd of goats and sheep passing by. Several animal skulls can also be found around the monument, completing the surreal scene. It is no coincidence that the Imperial Map Monument is located in Kharkhorin, as this town (then called Karakorum) was the capital of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan’s successor, Ögedei. Imperial Map Monument is a great vantage point to take in the modern town of Kharkhorin and the Orkhon River, and picture what this collection of dirt roads and low-rise buildings may have looked like in its glory days.",The monument is on the east side of the Orkhon River. It's a roughly 10-minute drive from the more easily located Erdene Zuu Monastery.
19,Mongolian Military Museum,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia","Thousands of artifacts tell Mongolia's military history, from the Bronze Age to the present.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mongolian-military-museum,"From Bronze Age knives to modern hand grenades and from catapults to rocket launchers, this museum delivers when it comes to weapons. It’s stuffed with artifacts detailing Mongolia’s long military history. The Mongolian Military Museum is divided into four sections and houses around 8,000 items related to the ancient and modern Mongolian army. It was opened in 1996 under the supervision of the Ministry of Defense. Two sections of the museum are on the ground floor. The first section is dedicated to weapons found in archaeological sites all around the country. You can spot items like bows, arrowheads, axes, and knives from the Bronze Age. Weapons and objects such as armor, horse saddles, and stirrups from later epochs are also collected here. Alongside these artifacts you’ll find reconstructions of other old military items like several swords, two 13th-century uniforms, and a catapult stand. The second section of the museum is packed with modern weapons from the 20th and 21st centuries. Most of the items are from World War I and World War II and are predominantly Mongolian, but you’ll also spot some Russian, Japanese, and German weapons in the mix as well. There are also numerous portraits of Mongolian military heroes and a cordoned-off area with a painting of Lenin looming over a desk. A section focusing on Mongolia’s post-World War II participation in peacekeeping missions was donated by the United States Embassy. In the basement is the third section, which by and large is a continuation of the second. The top floor is the most recent addition to the museum and it consists of displays of Mongolian military uniforms from both current and bygone eras. Last but not least, in the yard are some tanks, anti-aircraft guns, armored vehicles, and an MIG fighter plane.",
20,Centre of Shaman Eternal Heavenly Sophistication,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",A nondescript dirt lot hides an intriguing center of shamanic healing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/centre-of-shaman-eternal-heavenly-sophistication,"The Centre of Shaman Eternal Heavenly Sophistication is a rather grandiose name for a place that is, to say the least, underwhelming at first sight. The center is a small dirt yard wedged between modern buildings and a busy road. Like many others in the neighborhood, this dirt yard has a ger (traditional tent) and a semi-permanent ger-like structure. But don’t be fooled by its initial appearance. This place may lack in charm or distinctiveness, but it’s supposed to be as authentic as it gets. A shaman renowned for her power to mediate between this and the other world lives on the premise, and more than one shaman may be on the premise at any given time. The semi-permanent ger-like structure is the heart of the center. There’s no sign and no indication it’s anything other than someone’s private dwelling, so it can be quite unnerving to push the door open. All along the circular perimeter of the structure there are tables and cabinets neatly displaying statuettes, figurines, seashells, beads, pebbles, incense burners, scrolls, drums, antlers, bones, and other (seemingly) random items. The circular display is interrupted by a large wooden chair sitting on a bear skin and by a collection of furry and feathered costumes, a heavy leather outfit, and traditional hats. Outside, there’s an altar that consists of some poles arranged in the style of a tepee and covered by animal hide, but the strong winds from the steppes have blown away part of the covering. A table for offerings and three tridents adorned with yak hair complete the altar. Other features in the yard include two white statues, an ovoo with the skull of a bull, and the ger where the shaman lives. No one knows for certain how long shamanism has been part of Mongolian culture, but it’s been present since at least the earliest recorded history. Instead of being pushed aside by the arrival of Buddhism, it mingled with it, giving birth to the Mongolian Buddhist tradition. The socialist regime repressed all forms of religious expressions, but shamanism never died. With the collapse of the socialist regime in the last century, it came back. Now, it’s pretty common to come across people offering shamanic services.","Pictures aren't allowed within the actual center, but you can photograph the outer yard."
21,Danzanravjaa Museum,"Sainshand, Mongolia",Hidden treasures belonging to Mongolia's most revered and multi-talented monk spent decades buried in the Gobi desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/danzanravjaa-museum,"The story of the museum dedicated to Dulduityn Danzanravjaa, one of Mongolia’s most revered and multi-talented monks, is almost as dramatic as the man himself. His treasured possessions, such as several kangling (flute made of human femur), a damaru (double-headed drum made of two human skulls), and two kapala (cup made of human skull cups) were long buried in remote, secret locations around the Gobi desert. Danzanravjaa, known by epithets such as the “Lama of the Gobi,” belonged to the Nyingma school of Buddhism, and was the fifth reincarnation in the Noyon Khutukt line of monks. He was born in 1803 and was identified as a lama when he was 12, before which he wandered around the Gobi with his minstrel father, singing songs for money. His biggest claim to fame is his poetry, in which he criticized social evils that he witnessed around him. This is followed closely by his divination, paintings, and writings on medicine, philosophy, and astrology. He was also an active advocate for public education, and set up a primary school, a library and a museum at the monastery where he resided. As if this were not enough, Dulduityn Danzanravjaa was also a talented dancer and choreographer, and established a theatre company that staged dances, plays, and operas promoting women’s rights. In short, Danzanravjaa was the consummate Renaissance man, and is remembered for his immense contributions to all of these fields. Danzanravjaa died in 1856 under shadowy circumstances, believed to have been poisoned by one of his enemies. With the end of his life began the story of the museum in his name that stands today. One of his trusted disciples, Balchinchoijoo collected all his possessions, stored them in crates, and acted as the curator of Danzanravjaa’s relics. This role was passed down to his heirs, and it was the duty of a descendent named Tudev to safeguard them during the Soviet era in the 20th century. At the time, there was a crackdown against religious institutions and artifacts, and hundreds of monastic complexes in Mongolia were destroyed. Tudev carefully prepared each crate for storage and even set traps for extra protection. Every night he buried one in a remote location in the Gobi desert, and memorized the location. In this manner, he managed to bury 64 of the nearly 1,500 crates before the army destroyed the remaining artifacts. He passed on the information about the location of the buried treasures only to his heir, his grandson Altangerel. When Mongolia became free of Communist rule in 1990, it was finally safe for Altangerel to dig up the crates and see what remained of artifacts. Another 24 boxes were unearthed and the relics were placed in the museum in Sainshand, which was opened the following year. Among the exhibits are the costumes used for his theatrical productions, the aforementioned kangling, damaru, and kapala, some shamanistic implements, samples of his manuscripts, and other paraphernalia rescued from the many monasteries that he set up.",
22,Petroglyphs of Tsagaan Salaa-Baga Oigor,"Ulaankhus, Mongolia",These ancient pecked images are among the oldest and best-preserved in Mongolia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/petroglyphs-of-tsagaan-salaa-baga-oigor,"Among the snow-capped peaks, freshwater lakes, and grassy valleys of Altai Tavan Bogd National Park, thousands of ancient petroglyphs cover the rocks of the Tsagaan-Salaa Valley. Located in the westernmost province of Mongolia, the 15-kilometer site is home to at least 10,000 figures pecked and engraved during the Neolithic Period and the Bronze Age. Many of the petroglyphs depict humans herding or hunting wild animals, offering a glimpse of how the hunter-gatherer lifestyle would eventually give way to the domestication of animals as livestock. A closer look reveals that some of the figures resemble extant wildlife—animals that continue to roam this alpine landscape today—such as red deer, ibexes, and snow leopards.","Keep in mind that petroglyphs can only be conserved if admired from a distance. Please refrain from touching, rubbing, or walking on the artwork."
23,Beatles Monument,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",A beloved tribute to the Fab Four and the freedoms they inspired.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beatles-monument-mongolia,"This seemingly random, incongruous little monument in the capital of Mongolia  commemorates not only one of the world’s most beloved bands, but also an important time in recent Mongolian history. Set in a small square near the State Department store, the monument marks the place where, in Communist times, young Mongolians would assemble and listen to forbidden Western music and discuss ideas of freedom and democracy. The Beatles’ music is even credited with inspiring Mongolians to fight for their democracy. On one side of the monument, you’ll see bas-reliefs of the four Beatles. Head to the other side, and you’ll uncover a depiction of a young man sitting on some stairs, strumming a guitar. This image pays tribute to the many Mongolian youths who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s and were inspired by the iconic group. But though the tribute to the Beatles is a beloved part of the city, for a while, it seemed as though developers were not content to just let it be. In 2017, locals took to the streets to save the monument, which had been slated for demolition. Their protests paid off, and the monument still stands today.","As it's located in a public space, you can walk by it at any time for free."
24,Mongolian Railway History Museum,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",A collection of old steam and diesel locomotives sitting in a fenced-off garden.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mongolian-railway-history-museum,"Not far from the Ulaanbaatar Railway Station, six obsolete locomotives sit unmoving in a fenced-off garden adjacent to the tracks. The open-air display of trains, collectively known as the Mongolian Railway History Museum, is dedicated to the history of the locomotives that once traversed the country. One is outfitted with a golden plate depicting Joseph Stalin, while two others bear red, five-pointed stars, a symbol associated with communist ideology. Railway development has played a significant role in recent Mongolian history, especially in relation to the coal mining industry. Extending south from the Mongolia–Russia border, the Trans-Mongolian Railway reached Ulaanbaatar in 1950, and was expanded to the southern Chinese border some five years later. Prior to that, there were only a few freight trains carrying coal between Mongolian mines and Russian coal plants. The collection features three steam-powered trains as well as three diesel-powered locomotives. For railway buffs, these include: Locomotive 2-10-0 (L-3167), 750mm gauge T159, Voroshilovgrad 2M62M-043, Te1-20-011 (erroneously marked as TEM1-166), Baldwin/ALCO-influenced 2-10-0, and Su 208-88.","The museum is located at the intersection of Narnii Road and Peace Bridge.  The gate is typically locked, but the fence surrounding the collection is low, so you can appreciate the locomotives from the outside."
25,Mongolia/Russia Border Crossing No. 487,"Teshig, Mongolia",This extremely remote border crossing was closed to prevent smuggling and looting.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mongoliarussia-border-crossing-no-487,"Many places in Mongolia feel remote due to the long distances dividing them, with precious little to see along the way except the vastness of the steppes and the occasional herd. Yet, even by Mongolian standards, the Mongolia/Russia Border Crossing N. 487 is as remote and obscure as it gets. For one, the crossing has no attractions anywhere near it, and two, reaching it requires significant logistical arrangements. There are some excellent reasons to visit it, but you have to be seriously committed to getting to this isolated location. Border Crossing No. 487 is set deep inside thousands of hectares of Siberian forest, both on the Mongolian and Russian side. On the Mongolian side, very few hamlets can be found across this desolate landscape, and the infrastructure is extremely poor. What’s more, winter brings abundant snowfall and subarctic temperatures (reaching -55 degrees F), making these places reachable only by horses and the sturdiest 4x4 vehicles. There are currently 10 operating border crossings between Mongolia and Russia: five open only to Mongol and Russian nationals, three open to all, one open to freight, and one to passenger trains. There used to be more, and the history of those closed borders speaks to the complex relationship between these two countries. The current Northern Mongolian border was established in 1911, but at that time, Mongolia shared it with two countries, the Tuvan Republic and the Soviet Union. Now, it’s shared only with Russia, after the Soviet Union annexed the Tuvan Republic in 1944. The Tuvan section of the Mongolia/Russia border has always been problematic due to cattle thefts across the border and a thriving smuggling trade, and Border Crossing No. 487 was considered a hot-spot for these activities. Due to the terrain and the remoteness, controlling the border was all but impossible, and it was therefore decided that Border Crossing No. 487 would close. To deter looters and smugglers, the border guards on both sides are instructed to shoot trespassers that enter the area without a permit. Drastic as it may sound, it seems that the move succeeded in pacifying the region. Since its closure, Border Crossing No. 487 has become a destination for a trickle of local tourists. The two posts delimitating the Mongol and Russian territories are set about 10 feet apart, and a white stump of a post was placed in the middle to demarcate the exact border point. It is a simple sight, in a way, but it is steeped in local history and natural beauty.","Do not go to this border crossing without a permit. To visit, you must obtain a permit from the General Authority for Border Protection in Ulaanbaatar. Once you have the permit, you need a 4x4 vehicle to negotiate the 180-km of dirt road from the Bulgan-Murun Road to the border. Along the way, you’ll encounter muddy patches of road, sharp rocks, sand banks and several rivers to ford. Depending on the time of the year and the weather, river depth can be a serious obstacle. Approximately 20 km to the border, there is a road block with a few houses around. Permits are checked here, and an armed guard will be assigned to escort visitors to the border."
26,Kharkhorin Rock,"Kharkhorin, Mongolia",A mysterious phallic rock on the grounds of a Buddhist monastery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kharkhorin-rock,"Wandering around Erdene Zuu Monastery, the oldest Buddhist monastery in Mongolia, the absolute last thing you’d expect to find is a sculpture of a penis. But just northeast of the building, there it is: a 24-inch stone phallus known as Kharkhorin Rock, standing alone in the middle of a dusty patch of ground, protected by a small fence. Why in the world would such a risqué sculpture be placed in the middle of a historic spiritual sanctuary? The answer is steeped in centuries of legend. The story goes that there was once a monk who swore to be celibate, but was secretly a womanizer. When the other monks discovered this hidden secret, he was castrated, but they were worried that this offense would inspire similar deeds from a different monk. The large stone phallus seemed to do the trick, serving as a constant, explicit reminder to stay celibate. What makes the story more bizarre is that many women in the area believe Kharkhorin Rock has a completely opposite spiritual purpose, facilitating the miracle of childbirth. Legend has it that women who stand with their legs spread to straddle the sculpture will be more likely to successfully bear a child.",
27,Abandoned Petroleum Distribution Center,"Hatgal, Mongolia",Traces of the thriving lake trade that once linked the Soviet Union with Mongolia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-petroleum-distribution-center,"Hatgal is a village with fewer than 3,000 inhabitants, though the number swells in the summer when tourists flock to town. It is situated on the southernmost tip of Lake Khovsgol, the largest lake in Mongolia by volume, and it stretches almost all the way to the border between Mongolia and neighboring Russia. In the 1980s, the population was more than double what it is today. These were the golden days for Hatgal, when trade between Mongolia and the Soviet Union was at its peak. Being a satellite state of the USSR for 70 years, Mongolia had a very limited choice of trade partners, and Khovsgol Lake provided an optimal solution for transporting goods between the two Communist countries. In the summer, boats would ply the lake’s navigable routes, and in winter, trucks would travel on its frozen surface as if it were a highway. Apart from being a thriving lakeside port town, Hatgat was also home to an important petroleum distribution center. Petroleum was imported from the USSR, stored in the massive tanks by the lake shore, and eventually distributed throughout Western Mongolia. The government of Mongolia introduced some laws restricting the amount of traffic over Lake Khovsgol due to increasing pollution. However, the real economic blow came in 1991, when the USSR collapsed almost overnight and trade plummeted to nothing. The petroleum distribution has sat abandoned ever since. Of its original facilities, a couple of buildings on the lake shore that used to house administrative personnel are now badly cracked, but are still (barely) standing. Six huge metal tanks are still connected to the network of pipelines that used to carry petroleum to the furthest reaches of Western Mongolia. Four boats survived the test of time, two of which were probably used as oil tankers. Several other boats can be seen laying at the bottom of the lake. To some, these facilities are eyesores on the shore of a beautiful glacial lake, but for anyone interested in industrial archaeology, they are important relics of a geopolitical era that is no more.",
28,Eej Khad (Mother Rock),"Sergelen, Mongolia",Buddhist pilgrims journey to this sacred rock to leave offerings and have their wishes granted.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eej-khad-mother-rock,"Eej Khad, translating literally to “Mother Rock,” is a prime destination for devout Buddhists and shamans in Mongolia. It’s a granite stone that natural elements molded into a vaguely human form. Pilgrims flock to this location to seek advice and have their dreams or wishes granted. The worshippers that journey here make offerings in the form of biscuits, rice, milk, and vodka. These goodies are placed on tables or liberally scattered and splashed all around the compound. Consequently, Eej Khad may not be a paragon of cleanliness, but it’s all part of the ceremony. As the name suggests, the rock is likened to a female figure, and many pilgrims see it as symbolic of motherly protection, generosity, and wisdom. The standard practice is to express three dreams or wishes and circle the rock three times. Eej Khad tends to attract wishes related to procreation, general wellbeing, especially for children, and a plentiful harvest. Others treat the rock as a proxy for their deceased mothers, with whom they seek communion and comfort. Eej Khad is covered by a woman’s garment and a ponytail is attached at the back to enhance the human resemblance. The whole area surrounding the rock is peppered with oovos and sacred rocks, and shamans can occasionally be seen performing rituals at the site.","Eej Khad is located on the slope of the Avdar Bayan Uul mountain in the central Mongolian steppe, roughly 70 miles south of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city. It is at least a 10 miles off the nearest major road, the Zuunmod-Mandalgovi Highway."

Antonov An-24 airplanes were produced in the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1979, and only 1,264 models saw the light of day. China produced another 103 models of an aircraft identical to the Antonov An-24, but under the name Xian Y-7. The Antonov aircraft was equipped with two four-blade propellers powered by a turbine engine (a turboprop). The Antonov An-24 may not be the epitome of elegance and beauty, but was built to withstand harsh conditions, and it did. It was able to take off and land on unpaved surfaces and needed little maintenance. The sturdiness and reliability of the aircraft was perfect for the challenging environment of Mongolia. In the 1960s and 1970s, several models of Antonov An-24 were acquired by the Mongolian Air Force and by two civil operators, namely MIAT and Hangard Airline. These aircraft are no longer used in Mongolia neither for military nor for civil service. They were instead parked in residential Ulaanbaatar as part of the MIAT fleet. This particular aircraft currently belongs to the School of Mechanical Engineering and Transportation. It appears abandoned but is in fact, used for educational purposes. The buildings surrounding the aircraft resemble ordinary apartment blocks found in the same neighborhood. Measuring 77 feet (23.53 meters) in length and 26 feet (8.30 meters) in height, the Antonov An-24 looks out of place and makes for a curious sight in the neighborhood.",
30,Choijin Lama Monastery,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",The monastery survived the Communist revolution in Mongolia as a religious museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/choijin-lama-monastery,"Choijin Lama Monastery is a compound encompassing five temples, pleasant gardens, and a few meandering footpaths. This historical monastery is dwarfed by the striking modern buildings towering around it. The meeting of the new and the old architecture is conflicting and harmonious at once. Built using blue bricks and topped by a wooden roof, the temples in this monastery are rare specimens of pre-revolution structures exhibiting Chinese architecture in Mongolia. After four years of construction work, the monastery became operative in 1908, but soon after its inauguration, the monastery faced an uncertain future. The advent of the Communist revolution in Mongolia in 1921 brought with it the resolve to erase all manifestations of religious traditions. Very few monasteries and temples survived the purges, and those that did survive were deprived of their religious significance and reconceptualized as museums, buildings of historical importance, or simply used for administrative purposes. Choijin Lama Monastery survived as a museum of religious artifacts. Each of the five temples in the monastery is dedicated to a deity. The main temple features an 18th-century statue of the Shakyamuni Buddha. On its right is a statue of Choijin Lama, and on its left is the statue of Baldan Choephel (teacher and head monk) with his mummified remains encased. Together, these temples house a vast collection of Buddhist masks, thangkas (Buddhist paintings on fabric), sculptures, and scriptures. Along the wooden panes covering one of the temples are possibly the most eye-catching paintings in the entire complex. An array of gruesome images portray mangled bodies, severed limbs, and dangling organs. This is the section of the temple dedicated to the Naraka, or Buddhist Hell. This kind of religious art is meant to encourage believers to conduct a virtuous life and remind them to make merits in order to lessen the suffering in Naraka.",
31,Bagan,"Nyaung-U, Myanmar (Burma)","Over 2,000 ancient temples dot the Myanmar landscape at the site of this famed archaeological site.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bagan,"At its prime, the former city of Bagan on the plains of central Burma was likely a wondrous metropolis of ornate, gleaming temple spires and ritual artistry. But it’s possibly even more beautiful and mysterious now that it’s a jaw-dropping ruin. During its heyday around the 12th century, the capital of the Kingdom of Pagan contained well over 10,000 Buddhist temples, stupas, and pagodas. Eventually, the city was brought to ruin by natural disasters and hordes of Mongols, who made light work of the city’s Buddhist inhabitants. Through the centuries, thousands of the temples and pagodas crumbled under their own weight or were destroyed, leaving only a little over 2,000 of the structures today. However, this has done little to diminish the scope of the city’s grandeur. The almost impossibly ornate temples that survive rise up out of the overgrown foliage. The structures, which burst from the plains, look like the creations of a lost civilization. While that is not strictly true, as many of the inhabitants of Bagan would sire the generations that created modern Myanmar, a sense of mystery still pervades the city. Still covering 26 square miles of land, the thousands of ruined temples and religious monuments are now a protected historical site. While some of the structures have fallen into complete disrepair, many others almost look as if they haven’t aged a day, thanks to modern restoration efforts.","The best place to lodge in the area is Old Bagan. With the influx of tourists in recent times, new hotels in New Bagan and Nyaung-U are also opening. Bagan can be toured on foot, giving you an impressive perspective of the old city, although the preferred method of experiencing the ruins (technically known as the Bagan Archaeological Zone today) is via hot air balloon. Balloon rides are offered that bring visitors to a vantage point where they can view the thousands of temples at once. However, the hot air balloon season in Bagan is very short (from October 1 to March 31) due to the extremely hot weather in the region. Other good alternatives to explore the archaeological site are horse carts (the old fashioned way) or e-bikes, which can be more efficient since the ruins are spread out."

While most of Kakku’s stupas were built in the 17th and 18th centuries, the largest is believed to have been built in the 12th century during the reign of Alaungsithu, King of Bagan, as part of expanding religious sites across his empire. Since then, two main architectural designs have created a distinct forest of 2,478 needle stick pagodas that reach out to take the shape of Buddha’s footprint. From the main stupa, where wisps of omnipresent incense smoke perfume the musty air, visitors can walk through the small channels within rows of smaller stupas, each breathtaking in their nuanced designs, many featuring stucco reliefs in differing forms of veneration. While the renovation is ongoing, plenty of the stupas suffer from varying degrees of weathering and damage from the odd earthquake that blights many temple complexes within Myanmar. Due to its remoteness and location within Shan State, visitors are few, although the authorities have created a reflecting pool for photographic delights. Thankfully, unlike at other more famous temples, there isn’t the need to wait for hours to get that cover shot.","Tours are available from the Inle area. If traveling independently, admission to the site is US $3 and a compulsory, but knowledgeable, Pa-O guide costs $5 payable at the tourism office in Taunggyi.

Inwa — also spelled Innwa, known in classical Pali as Ratanapura (“City of Gems”), and known locally as Awa or Ava — was originally founded in 1365. Located at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Myitnge Rivers on an artificial island formed by a canal connecting the two rivers upstream from their natural point of meeting, Inwa was built to be the capital of a newly unified kingdom that came to be known, appropriately enough, as the Kingdom of Ava. And so it remained for 190 years, serving not only as the seat of power in Upper Burma, but also as the center of a flourishing period of Burmese literature. In 1555 the Kingdom of Ava fell. However, the city of Inwa and its political prestige lived on, serving as the capital of all of Burma from 1599 to 1613, then again from 1635 to 1752, then again from 1765 to 1783. Then again from 1821 to 1842. The aforementioned series of devastating earthquakes struck on March 22, 1839; the entire region was affected, but the capital was hit particularly hard. Although Inwa had been sacked, destroyed, and rebuilt several times over its long history, this time it would not be so. The city was not rebuilt, the capital was officially moved to Amarapura on February 10, 1842, and Inwa was left to the elements. The former imperial city is now a rural area where livestock graze and farmers raise crops amidst the remains of pagodas, palace towers, monasteries, and massive city walls that once formed the outline of a seated lion. One of the monasteries — Bagaya Kyaung, a towering structure built entirely of teak — is still in use as a monastery and school today. Local guides provide tours of the site via horse-drawn carts.",
34,The Mingun Pagoda and Bell,"Min Kun, Myanmar (Burma)",Gigantic unfinished stupa and the world's 2nd largest bell.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mingun,"Nice pile of bricks you’ve got here. The Mingun Pahtodawgyi is a nice pile of bricks indeed and holds the record for being the biggest pile of bricks in the world. Intended to be a 500 foot high stupa, a mound housing Buddhist relics, the Pahtodawgyi remains unfinished to this day but is still an awe-inspiring structure. Measuring 450 by 450 feet and 172 feet high, it dwarfs the surrounding area, and would easily have rivaled the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza had King Bodawpaya finished its construction. Construction began in 1790, using mostly slave labor, and causing a massive drain on resources and manpower in the area. The project was widely unpopular during its time, which some suspect caused its cessation. King Bodawpaya was a superstitious man and during the construction, it was prophesied that the completion of the great stupa would cause his death or the destruction of the country. Worried about maintaining his empire, the king slowed progress on the stupa. When he died, construction was abandoned completely. Despite not completing the stupa, construction on an accompanying bell was finished, and was similarly grand in size. The finished bell weighed over 200,000 pounds and is 12 feet high. The massive bell can be rung by striking the outside since it has no internal ringing mechanism. Since the early 19th century, the stupa has become increasingly decrepit. An earthquake in 1839 left giant cracks along the face of the stupa, and wear and tear have led it to become almost natural looking. Without the bright white entrance, visitors could easily mistake the stupa for a large earthen mound, or simply a pile of bricks.",Entrance is 5000 K (US $3.50)
35,Kyaiktiyo Pagoda,"Thaton District, Myanmar (Burma)",A precariously perched golden rock defies gravity and brings pilgrims from across Myanmar.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyaiktiyo,"Perched dangerously on the edge of a cliff, pilgrims have been visiting the Kyaiktiyo Pagoda for centuries to meditate and give offerings to the Buddha. Whether this worship keeps the boulder from rolling down the precipice is unclear, but the gold-leaf covered stone certainly inspires all who visit. At 25 feet high and 50 feet around, the golden boulder in Mon State, Myanmar is hard to miss. According to legend, a Buddhist hermit was given a strand of hair from the Buddha himself, which he then gave to the king. For his gift, the king offered the hermit a boulder shaped like his head, and used magical powers to pull the boulder from the ocean. The king then built the small pagoda atop the rock to enshrine the Buddha’s hair for all eternity and pilgrims have flocked to the site ever since. Although the pagoda is small by comparison to other grand Buddhist places of worship, its location on the precarious boulder makes up for its miniature 24-foot spire. Seemingly barely resting on its base, the precariously placed golden rock draws thousands every year. Pilgrimage is at its peak during the Full Moon day of Tabaung in March, when 90,000 candles are lit at the site and the golden boulder shines in the night sky.","There is accommodation available at the top of the Mountain, or in Kinpun, at the foot of the Mountain, where you can then travel up by pick-up truck (one way costs 2,500 Kyat). Getting to Kinpun is a 4-5 hour bus ride from Yangon, or 6 hour train journey."
36,Shwedagon Pagoda,"Yangon, Myanmar (Burma)",This gem-encrusted temple is said to contain some of the Buddha's hair which can make the deaf hear and the blind see.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shwedagon-pagoda,"Towering over the Burmese city of Yangon, the Shwedagon Pagoda is rumored to be the oldest Buddhist pagoda in the world, and more miraculous than the priceless gems and gold plates coating its exterior, it is also said to hold hairs from the head of Buddha himself. As the legend goes, two brothers were traveling when they encountered the Buddha beneath a tree. After feeding him, Buddha offered them a gift and gave them exactly eight hairs from his head. The brothers then carried the sacred hairs in a ruby casket back to their country where, with the help of the king, they began building what would become the Shwedagon Pagoda complex. When the casket containing the holy hair was opened, the relic unleashed a flood of miracles including causing the blind to see, the lame to walk, and seeing a rain of gemstones issue from the sky. A number of other relics were also entombed at the shrine including a holy staff, a piece of cloth from a sacred figures robe, and oddly a revered water filter. If the legend is believed, the pagoda is around 2,600 years old, but many scientists have placed its construction closer to 1,000 to 1,400 years old. Either way, the opulent site has survived through war and political turmoil in the area and still looms over Yangon in glittering glory. The large central stupa is covered in real gold plates that are constantly donated from countries around the world as needed, and its tip is encrusted with rubies and diamonds. Both spiritually and materially glorious, the Shwedagon Pagoda is one of the wonders of the modern Buddhist world, and may be one of the fanciest sites ever to be founded on a handful of hair.","Head towards the golden stupa that towers over Yangon. Shwedagon Pagoda is open daily, from 4-22. Last admission is at 21:45. The ticket is valid for the whole day, so you can visit the pagoda during the day and also at night. Shwedagon Pagoda on weekends and middle of the day can get really crowded, so avoid this time. If possible hire a guide, who will explain everything about the pagoda and the rituals, enhancing your experience hugely. You won't be allowed to enter the temple grounds if you're dressed in shorts. You can rent or buy a sarong outside the entry gate."

The landscape around the small town of Hpa’an in Karen State, Myanmar, combines lush open fields and single, bulbous mountains. At the bottom of one such mountain is a steep staircase, painted white. Once at the top, a narrow path leads you into the Saddar Cave, hollowed out of the rock. Buddhist statues, like road signs of all different shapes and sizes, beckon visitors into the darkness. Hundreds of miniature golden icons not much bigger than playing cards form a mosaic onto the righthand side of the cave. You’ll pass a pagoda about the size of a small van and the light then weakens. Visitors must remove their shoes. Only then does the stench of bat droppings fill the nostrils. Sometimes you can hear the bats shriek. Inside the mountain, the painted faces of Buddhist sculptures occasionally flicker into view as you wander through the darkness. Karen State is famous for its Buddhist sites, but Saddar Cave is truly a natural wonder, as well as a holy place. Flash photography illuminates stalactites dripping from the ceiling and stalagmites rise up from the ground, formed over centuries. In one section of the cave a ray of sunshine beams down directly onto one of the largest stalagmites. The path ends at the entrance to open water, where a local boatman armed with a paddle next to a flat wooden canoe will continue your journey out of the cave and out onto a pristine blue lagoon. Paddle around and watch fisherman source their lunch against a backdrop of the limestone rock face.",The Soe Brothers Hostel in Hpa'an arranges travel to Saddar Caves.
38,World's Largest Book at Kuthodaw Pagoda,"Mandalay, Myanmar (Burma)","This golden temple is surrounded by hundreds of stone tablets that comprise the ""world's largest book.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-s-largest-book-at-kuthodaw-pagoda,"Call it the “anti-Kindle,” call it the “world’s largest book,” or call it “really hard to read,” there is no disputing that the expansive tome etched on over 700 stone slabs surrounding Myanmar’s glittering Kuthodaw Pagoda form a volume that would test even the most ardent book lover. The Kuthodaw Pagoda was built 1857 by King Mindon Min. The gorgeous temple building is completely gilded on the exterior, giving it the look of a solid gold spectacle. However the true spectacle lays within the stark white stupas that surround its base. Beneath the pinnacled roofs of the squat little structures are 730 marble tablets (729 contain body of the text, while the 730th tablet describes their creation) covered on both sides with dense script. Taken all together, these comprise the entirety of Theravāda Buddhism’s religious canon, its tipitaka (a phrase meaning “three baskets,”which is a reference to the baskets in which the original Buddhist teachings were held). The thick stone tablets each stand over five feet tall and five inches thick. When the tablets were unveiled in 1868, each line of writing had been filled with golden ink and the stones were decorated with precious stones including rubies and diamonds. Unfortunately after the British invaded in the mid-1880s, the troops looted the temple site, stripping the slabs of their gold ink and gems. However today the sprawling book still stands, and the writing has been refilled with simple black ink so that while the opulent glory may have disappeared, the messages of the writings themselves live on for future generations. It might not be light reading, but it is assuredly enlightening.",
39,Thanboddhay Pagoda,Myanmar (Burma),"Luxurious devotion and 500,000 images of Buddha in Myanmar.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thanboddhay-pagoda,"On the average cathedral tour of Europe, tourists quietly take in the immense stained glass, the high vaulted ceilings and somber atmosphere. The average pagoda tour on the other hand is the complete opposite, and in many ways the most quintessential difference between East and West. Thanboddhay Pagoda is a massive Buddhist complex in Monywa, Myanmar. It is a gilded world, brightly screaming out praise for Buddha through colorful celebration. Throughout the area, each pillar and tower of the Pagoda is carefully and completely covered with images of Buddha. From statues inside the pagoda, to miniatures climbing the sides of the building itself, there are 500,000 depictions of Buddha in total. Although it was originally built in the early 14th century, it was reconstructed in 1939, and is incredibly preserved in its golden form. Unlike many other temples in Myanmar, the entrance is not guarded by lions. Instead, two imposing white elephants stand out against their shimmering backdrop. Since its reconstruction, the pagoda has been one of the largest tourist attractions in Myanmar, drawing awe-struck tourists and pious religious visitors alike.",
40,Mount Popa,"Myingyan, Myanmar (Burma)","Myanmar's Mount Olympus atop a 2,500-foot volcanic plug.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacred-mt-popa,"Established and maintained by a hermit in the early 20th century, the Mount Popa shrine and monastery precariously sits 2,500 feet off the ground on a massive volcanic formation in central Myanmar. Climbing 777 steps from the base of the vertical pedestal takes you to a monastery honoring what has come to be known as the center of Nat spirit activity in the nation. In Buddhist traditions of Myanmar, Nats are spirits of humans that met tragic ends and are portrayed accordingly in shrines across the country. One of the most well-known of the 37 spirits in the shrine of Mount Popa is Ko Gyi Kyaw, who died from his wild lifestyle and alcohol abuse. As the patron saint of tramps and alcoholics, his shrine is often covered in bottles of whiskey. Due to the Nat activity and shrine on Mount Popa, the area is known as the Mount Olympus of Myanmar. The shrine subsequently draws thousands of pilgrims every year, especially during full moon ceremonies two times per year. Non-religious visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the lush mountains, as well as the monkeys that live and beg for food around the monastery. Estimated 2,000 Rhesus macaques live in the monastery today and because of this, monkey poop is prevalent on the monastery steps (which pilgrims and visitors are supposed to climb barefoot). Consequently, a high number of people make their living cleaning up after the monkeys in exchange of a donation, and this fact has originated mixed feedback from visitors to Mount Popa.","Mount Popa is roughly 30 miles Southwest of Bagan. Wearing comfortable clothing covering the neckline and shoulders, cotton skirts (or pants) is ideal. The dress code is the same as for visiting Bagan temples. Since you are expected to walk barefoot, you can also bring socks to protect your feet."
41,U Bein Bridge,"Mandalay, Myanmar (Burma)",The oldest teak bridge in the world is made from the remains of a royal palace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/u-bein-bridge,"Stretching across Taungthaman Lake in Myanmar, the U Bein Bridge might look like just another rickety wooden crossing (which it is), but this historic span is actually made of the remains of a royal palace. Construction on the wooden bridge was completed in 1851 after three years. The bridge was built at a slight curve, and is supported by over a thousand wooden pillars that were hammered into the bottom of the shallow lake. The planks of teak that make up the surface of the bridge were taken from the old royal palace of Inwa, a former Burmese capital, that had been razed a number of times. The resulting bridge might not look very royal, but its history certainly is. Reaching three-quarters of a mile in length, the ramshackle span is surprisingly long for a wooden bridge with no rails, but it cuts a striking figure. The bridge has become one of the region’s most popular tourist attractions and most photographed features. It is especially striking in the evening when the colors of the sunset paint the scene in natural color. This of course means that the bridge becomes more crowded during those times. All the attention has taken its toll on the span. Some of the pillars have been replaced with concrete, and many of the original planks will need to be replaced or refurbished, lest they come off completely. Nonetheless, the bridge is still a beautiful and popular place to capture the beauty of Myanmar.",
42,Snake Pagoda of Myanmar,"Kyaukse, Myanmar (Burma)",These serpents are considered holy and pampered accordingly.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snake-pagoda,"Officially called Yadana Labamuni Hsu-taungpye Paya, this Myanmar pagoda is generally known by another name: Hmwe Paya, or the “Snake Pagoda.” This out-of-the-way pagoda near Mandalay is distinguished by the large pythons who live happily coiled around the Buddha statue within. The temple was founded in 1974 when a Buddhist monk was tending the old pagoda. Inside, the monk found two large pythons wrapped around a statue of Buddha. The monk dutifully carried the snakes out to the jungle and returned to clean the pagoda. Within a day the snakes were back, and a third had joined. Each time, the monks would carry the snakes out to the jungle, and each time they would return. Eventually the monks came to see the snakes as holy, possibly the reincarnated souls of monks who used to tend to the pagoda. The monks stopped removing the snakes and instead began taking care of them. They take such nice care of them, in fact, that it makes sense that the snakes like to hang around the pagoda. The two pythons currently in residence are fed a pot of milk and three eggs every five days as well as a small amount of goat meat. Every morning at 11:00 a.m., the snakes are lovingly washed by the monks in a bath filled with flower petals. They are sometimes even dried with money left as an offering at the pagoda. Each year, thousands of the faithful make a pilgrimage to the temple, and the walls of the pagoda are lined with photos of families visiting the semi-holy serpents. Some depict toddlers happily bathing alongside the snakes. They snakes have never been known to injure anyone and seem quite happy to be touched by the visitors. Though the original pythons have died, new snakes have since been donated by faithful followers. The original snakes can still be seen in the pagoda, albeit in a taxidermied state. Considering the level of care the snakes receive, the snakes no doubt lived a long and happy life. The area surrounding the snake pagoda is also worth exploring and is full of overgrown and beautiful ruins rarely visited by tourists.",It's best to get a car and driver in nearby Mandalay.
43,Nagar Glass Factory,"Yangon, Myanmar (Burma)",The ruins of this prominent glass factory yield hidden treasures buried among the jungle floor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nagar-glass-factory,"A small snarl of jungle in Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) hides a trove of glass treasures. Those who visit can expect to find beautiful glass works in shades of blues, greens, whites, and reds buried beneath the mess of flora. The Nagar Glass Factory was Myanmar’s premier glass-making enterprise for decades and the country’s first hand-blown glass-factory. Their customers included the Pan Am airline company, independence leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and even the astronaut John Glenn. But it all came to an end when Cyclone Nargis, the worst natural disaster to ever hit the country, obliterated the factory in 2008. What remains in the jungle around the ruins of the former factory are the countless pieces of colorful glass that were in production or storage at the time. Amazingly, a large percentage of them somehow remain completely intact. It’s a bizarre, otherworldly and strangely beautiful site, even if the circumstances that led to its current state are tragic. Today, the family that ran the factory for decades still accepts visitors. In fact, every piece of glass lying in the jungle is available for purchase. It’s up to each visitor, however, to dig for his or her own treasure among the sprawling forest. While you’re there, be sure to take your time while scavenging through the layers of leaves that blanket the floor beneath the masses of toppled trees. You’ll be rewarded with small treasures like wine glasses, drinking glasses, and fruit bowls.","The Nagar Glass Factory is about a 20 minute walk from either Kamaryut or Thiri Myaing stations on Yangon's circular train line. It's not the easiest place to find and there are no signs along the way to point you in the right direction. Furthermore, many locals aren't even aware that it's still possible to visit.

It was constructed during the annexation of Burma by the British, as an exclusive watering hole for soldiers and officials of the British Army. The complex features long, two-story mansions that served as ballrooms, salons, and private rooms. It was one of the most prestigious and popular of the gentlemen’s clubs built in Southeast Asia during the height of the British Empire. The club wined and dined British royalty and many high-ranking officials within its walls, and its name lives on through its signature gin-based cocktail, the Pegu Club, that’s still served in bars today. Sadly, the racist membership policy of the time limited admission to whites only, and locals were only allowed in the club as workers. Somewhat surprisingly, the club stayed open for about two decades after Burmese independence was gained. It was eventually taken over by the Burmese military and later abandoned and left to rot. For years, the old colonial-era clubhouse remained in a state of decay, desperately in need of repair. After significant restorations, it reopened for business in November 2018.",

It was originally part of the royal palace complex in Amarapura, but was subsequently moved to Mandalay, where it became known as Mya Nan San Kyaw. Following its move, it became the northern section of the Glass Palace and also part of the king’s royal apartments. It would also be the final home and resting place of King Mindon, who died in this structure in 1878. King Mindon’s son Thibaw, who succeeded his father following his death, often used the building as meditation grounds, but became convinced that his father’s spirit still haunted the grounds, so he immediately ordered the building to be dismantled and removed from the Royal City. Over the course of the next 5 years following its dismantling, the building was reconstructed as a monastery and dedicated as a work of merit to the memory of King Mindon. During the latter stages of World War II, the rest of the old Royal Palace within the old Royal City burned as a result of allied bombing of the Japanese encamped in the old Royal Palace. Due to King Thibaw’s superstition and relocating of the building, he had preserved a significant remnant of the Royal Palace.","Entrance to Swenandaw Kyunag is included with the Mandalay Archeologic Zone combo ticket, which also includes Atumashi Kyaung, Cultural Museum Mandalay, Kuthodaw Paya, Maharani Paya, Mandalay Palace, Paleik Paya, Mandalay Palace, and the ancient cities Amarapura and Inwa."

In the winter, the water is too shallow for travellers, making the already remote site even more so. Upon disembarking, a visitor will discover a hillside complex containing over 1,600 Buddhist stupas, some of mud and stone, some intricately carved, some gilded with precious metals. While several have been restored, many have been reclaimed by the surrounding jungle and lay partially crumbled, covered in creeping greenery. These structures date from the 14th to the 18th centuries and are typical of Burmese zedi. Like others found across the region, the stupas feature fantastical creatures like chinthe - mythic lion-like beings that protect sacred spaces. These were (and remain) sites for contemplation and meditation and many contain relics inside their bases. The first stupas at Indein were likely commissioned during the reign of King Narapatisithu, although according to legend, it was King Ashoka - the Indian emperor responsible for spreading Buddhism across much of Asia - who first designated this as a site of particular spiritual importance. Hundreds of years later, that distinction is completely obvious. The sea of ornate spires coupled with the view over the lake and surrounding calm lend this spot an unquestionably mystic, reflective air.","From Nyaung Shwe ask for a boat (~18,000 kyat per boat) to take you to Indein,"

Fewer still can be seen driving along the often empty streets.  When these streets include a 20-lane highway which leads to the parliamentary buildings, one could be forgiven for wondering why such a gargantuan road, or the city itself, was necessary. Some reports suggest that the nervous president overseeing the construction of this new capital–for the entire thing was custom-built over an unknown number of years, in previously uninhabited jungle–insisted on the giant boulevard so that it could act as a runway for planes in case of riots. The reasons the government chose to relocate the capital from Rangoon (the previous capital) to a patch of previously uninhabited jungle 200 miles north remains equally unclear. Naypyidaw translates as the “abode of kings” and is six times larger than all of New York City. The project has been explained away as an “act of vanity,” the result of an astrologers warning, and as a way to cement power through sheer scale and geography. Naypydaw has also been described as the world’s largest ghost town. There aren’t many capital cities in the world which boast 20-lane highways and fewer still where it’s possible to lie in the middle of the road and take photos.","Regular trains run from Yangon (Rangoon) to Naypyitaw, but from the station onwards, the only way to travel around the sprawling, empty city is by car or taxi."

Located opposite of the Buddhist shrine of Kyauktalon Taung, the reclining Buddha is filled with rooms that showcase dioramas of the teachings of Buddha and a shrine. When visiting the giant Buddha it should be remembered that despite the odd novelty of walking into a giant head, it is still a place of worship, and shoes should be removed before entering the shrine. After almost 15 years of construction, the reclining Buddha is still not complete. In 2012, construction started on a second reclining Buddha opposite the original, with the aim of being built to stand the test of time. The poor concrete construction of the first has left the original with an uncertain future.","The entrance to the reclining Buddha image is located about 100 meters south of the Hindu temple on Yadana Taung on the left hand side of the Mawlamyine-Mudon road as you head towards Mudon.

It’s hard to miss the kaleidoscope of gemstones that gleams from its every inch. The entire pagoda is made from jade. According to Myanmar’s government, it’s the first pagoda in the world constructed solely from the precious stone. It’s a fitting choice of gemstone, as Myanmar produces almost 70 percent of the world’s supply of jadeite, a type of jade. Work on the monumental structure began in 2012 and didn’t finish until 2015. Even before construction started, a jewelry trader named U Soe Naing spent about 25 years collecting and stockpiling all the jade. He had to gather over 11,000 tons of the stones to build the pagoda. A series of chambers for praying and making merit ring the roughly 75-foot-tall structure. The exterior walls are inlaid with arrays of carved amulets, sculpted leaves, and inscriptions. There are also carved jade footprints of Buddha, where devotees and pilgrims can leave monetary donations. In combination with the Jade Market in Mandalay, this is really the best place to see excellent examples of the stone used within the context of Buddhism.

Containing over 8,000 depictions of the Buddha dating back as far as 1750, the Pindaya Cave is a constantly growing gallery of peaceful statuary. Among the immense collection are representations of the holy figure in almost every one of his traditional poses, including a few unique depictions, such as the Buddha with a single seed in his upturned palm which may be evidence that the cave was once used by a small Buddhist cult. The cave extends almost 500 feet into the hillside and is actually just one of three caves in the area, although the other two caves are not open to visitors and are believed to be quite shallow. Before reaching the cave however visitors must pass through the Shwe U Min Pagoda, the entrance to which is guarded by a large spider statue. The massive bug is actually in reference to a local legend that gives the cave its name. The story goes that seven princesses were forced to take refuge in the cave, but were sealed in by a giant spider’s web. They were eventually saved by a prince who killed the spider, and shouted, “Pinku Ya-Pyi!” meaning, “I’ve got the spider!” This would be truncated and elided over the centuries to “Pindaya.” Now every worshipper has a chance to see the spider for themselves. Cartoonish spider monsters and peaceful golden Buddhas might not seem to be much of a match, but Pindaya Cave brings them together nicely.",
51,Floating Gardens of Inle Lake,"Taunggyi, Myanmar (Burma)",A series of tiny artificial islands rich with produce bob atop the surface of the lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/floating-gardens-of-inle-lake,"Most gardens are rooted in soil, the seeds sown within plots of dirt firmly attached to the earth. But the communities around the shores of Taunggyi’s Inle Lake use a different technique to cultivate their crops. Rather than limit themselves to land, they’ve crafted a series of floating gardens that bob atop the water. Around a quarter of the massive freshwater lake—the country’s second largest body of water—is topped with these manmade gardens. Farmers glide between their plots from atop boats, plucking produce from patches of “land” that rise and fall with the currents. Tomatoes are the most prominent crop to come from these unconventional gardens. They’re so successful they make up around 90 percent of the gardens’ yields. Depending on the season, farmers can also harvest beans, cucumbers, flowers, and gourds. Naturally, root vegetables don’t fare so well in such shallow terrain. Creating these tiny islands is no easy task. Farmers must gather clumps of water hyacinth and seagrass and secure them in place with large bamboo poles, which they then stake into the lake’s muddy bottom. They then heap even more layers of seagrass and silt atop the mounds before planting seeds. The practice of farming atop the lake, rather than around it, is thought to have started in the 19th century before intensifying in the 1960s. Though the unusual agriculture has boosted the region’s economy, people have since started to worry that chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and runoff are destroying the lake’s natural ecosystem.",

Lim Chin Tsong was a merchant from Burma’s Hokkien Chinese community who turned his family’s rice business into a commodities fortune. Between 1917 and 1919, Tsong spent over two million rupees constructing an ornate villa blending Chinese and European architectural styles, with Burmese teak and Italian marble side by side. But in 1921, Tsong’s business suffered a major setback when the government banned the export of rice. He died just a few years later in 1924, and his estate was declared insolvent. The palace was home to the All Burma Broadcasting Station while the country was under Japanese control beteen 1941 and 1945, and after Burmese independence, it became the Kanbawza Yeiktha hotel in 1951. Myanmar’s Ministry of Culture took over the top floors in the 1950s and has maintained an art school there since, but maintenance has been neglected; the palace is just too big and frequent rain has abraded the old building. The building features the grand staircases, foyers, and columns of a European mansion alongside dougongs (interlocking brackets common in Chinese temples) and murals of the Great Wall by English painters Dod and Ernest Procter. The pagoda-like octagonal five-story tower, rising incongruously above a nearby highway overpass, provides a 360-degree view of the city’s rapidly rising skyline. A local rumor holds that secret tunnels connect the mansion to the nearby lake. The Ministry of Culture is currently renovating the building as a cultural center and it’s set to open in 2018.","Enter from University Avenue from the North, near the corner with Kabar Aye Pagoda Road."
53,Ramree Island,"Ramree, Myanmar (Burma)",The island that holds the world-record for largest human massacre caused by animals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ramree-island,"Ramree Island is located right off the coast of the Rakhine State, Myanmar and its white beaches and swaying palms are the perfect slice of heaven that every island should be. However, its infamous place in the history books comes from eye witness reports of an animals-gone-wild style massacre during World War II. According to historical interviews, anywhere between 500 to 1,000 retreating Japanese soldiers were devoured by a large infestation of saltwater crocodiles as the troops entered the marshes and mangroves that surround Ramree. Only around 20 of the men emerged to be captured by the pursuing forces. The survivors immediately began spewing tales of reptilian monsters, horrible screams, and agonizing death.  Due to a fair amount of press corroboration of the military tragedy, Ramree has the distinct honor of being host to the “Greatest Disaster Suffered by Humans Due to Animals” in the Guinness Book of World Records. Local residents dispute the legends of the frenzied feast that haunt their island to this day, but it is true that the highly territorial saltwater crocodiles do still live in alarming numbers around Ramree Island and they are not picky eaters. The beasts can and will eat almost anything that crosses their path including wayward humans. As the number of crocodiles in the area continues to grow, so does the death toll of their unsuspecting human prey.",

Constructed by King Bagyidaw in 1816, the Mya Thein Tan Pagoda represents Mount Meru, a sacred Buddhist mountain. The seven-tiered terraces resembled the mountain ranges topped by a stupa representing the legendary Sulamani pagoda. The king had the pagoda constructed in memory of his beloved consort and cousin, Princess Hshinphyume, who died in childbirth near the site where the pagoda was built. The pagoda now carries her namesake. In 1836, the Mya Thein Tan Pagoda fell victim to an earthquake that struck Min Kun. Left in ruins after the disaster, King Mindon restored the white pagoda in 1874. Today, visitors flock to the white pagoda to take a look at the panoramic view of Min Kun and its rural surroundings from above. Its stunning architecture has attracted many photographers who come to the Mya Thein Tan Pagoda for the traditional arts and sculptures adorning the shrine. Many local visitors wear traditional Burmese clothing and carry parasols with them or rent one upon entering the pagoda to take photos as a souvenir.",You can rent a traditional Burmese parasol and buy flowers as an offering to the pagoda at the entrance.

As part of the country’s only marine protected area, the Lampi Marine National Park, this small island is home to a number of rare nesting sea turtles, who lay their eggs each season on its sandy beaches just a few feet from the island’s back-to-nature eco-resort. The nesting turtle site is thanks to a unique collaboration between the Myanmar government and a private venture that created a conservation-led tourism project. Those that make it to this remote island will see guards protecting the sand dunes where sea turtles come up each full moon of the season to lay their eggs. The resident security guard often is stationed by a river platform where the trees hide camouflaged python snakes, wrapped around the trees, sleeping.

There’s evidence that in previous centuries, similar architectural gems were widespread throughout Myanmar, but fire, conflict, pests, and natural elements conspired to erase most of them. With the odds stacked against it, it’s a marvel that this monastery has survived to this day. Nat Taung Kyaung is not far from Old Bagan. There’s no consensus as to the exact date of its construction, but the most credible estimates claim it’s more than 200 years old. It’s important to note that Nat Taung Kyaung is not a temple, but a monastery. Most temples were built using stones, bricks, and stucco, but Nat Taung Kyaung, like most other monasteries from its era, is made of wood, a humbler material leading to a limited life expectancy. But as vulnerable as the material may be, Nat Taung Kyaung was built with teak and padauk wood, which, though not as durable as stone or bricks, is still extremely strong and humidity-resistant. In line with the Burmese architectural tradition, Nat Taung Kyaung exhibits a number of towers with multilayered roofs (pyatthat) and it sits on a wooden platform that forms its base. The intricate carvings decorating the various elements of the monastery have been weathered by the elements, but they still survive as a testimony to the craftsmanship of the artisans that sculpted them. Some restoration work has been undertaken to preserve this architectural jewel.","Nat Taung Kyaung is located in Taung-bi village, north of Old Bagan, along the Irrawaddy River. It is an active monastery, with monks residing in the premise."

Mud volcanoes are formed from methane gases trapped deep below the ground being forced to the surface. In some instances the pressure will push through the water table and mix with the clay or mud in the surrounding areas to create a “volcano” such as the ones found in Minbu. Unlike regular volcanoes, there is no heating involved and in fact, the mud is cool to the touch. The landscape is in Minbu looks like the surface of the moon (if the satellite had active geology) with multiple vents bubbling out of ever-growing craters in the ground. The area is revered as a religious site by the locals who hold the tradition that the volcanoes are powered by dragons deep within the earth. Visitors to the Minbu mud volcanoes are required to remove their shoes when they visit, but these volcanic surroundings aren’t about to burn anyone’s feet.","Travelling from nearby Magway, find a motorcycle taxi who can help with a return journey.

Atumashi Monastery is considered one of the largest religious buildings in Mandalay. The gigantic gold and white monastery was constructed by King Mindon in 1857. The monastery was once home to an image of Buddha that contained a massive diamond. The diamond was brought by the Governor of Rakhine from western Burma and presented to King Bodawpaya. However, in 1885, the diamond was lost during the British takeover of Mandalay and was never seen again. After the event of the lost diamond, the British seized control of the monastery in 1890 and turned it into a military barrack. However, this didn’t last long as the monastery was destroyed by a fire. Only the stairways and pillars underneath survived the disaster. A century after the mysterious fire, renovations to the monastery begun around 1990 and ended in 1996, salvaging a fragment of the city’s rich history.","Located east of the Shwenandaw Monastery, Atumashi Monastery is reachable from a narrow road leading to both monasteries."

The iconic balancing rock sits on a tidal platform amid a coral reef garden in the aptly named Boulder Bay. In between the rocky headlands, white sands stretch across the bay, forming a picture-perfect tropical island scene. Only recently opened to foreigners, the over-800 islands of the Mergui Archipelago were once the domain of pirates, and the archipelago has suffered from plundering and pillaging throughout its past. Closed following Burma’s independence and designated “out-of-bounds” during the decades of military rule, it is only in the last few years that intrepid visitors have been allowed back into the island group, which sits in the Andaman Sea off the coast of southern Myanmar. The archipelago is now a sought-after dive destination, featuring mega-fauna such as sharks, whale sharks, and dugongs, and it is sometimes regarded as the last island frontier. Boulder Island is the outermost island of the group, which helps to explain its other claim to fame: that it may have inspired the mythical faraway island of Neverland in J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan. A handful of eco-resorts have opened up recently on Boulder Island, offering low-impact, high-immersion experiences, including conservation projects showcasing the unique environment of the island.","To visit Boulder Island, you need to have an evisa for Myanmar, around $50 USD, and to arrange in advance your trip out to the island, where Boulder Bay Eco Resort is based.

Built in 1899 and officially opened in 1901, the bridge was constructed as part of the Mandalay to Lashio railway line into Northern Shan State, aimed at expanding the British Empire’s influence in Myanmar. The viaduct is located in the center of the country, about 60 miles northeast of Mandalay. It measures 689 meters (2,261 feet) long and it is built atop 14 towers that rise up to 102 meters (335 feet) above the gorge. At the time of its construction, the bridge was the tallest railway bridge in the world and was considered to be an engineering marvel. It was designed in London, and the pieces were manufactured by the Pennsylvania Steel Company. Pieces of the structure were built in the United States and then loaded onto ships for the months-long journey from New York to Southeast Asia. Just under a year after the pieces arrived, the bridge was assembled. American writer Paul Theroux’s describes the viaduct as “a monster of silver geometry in all the ragged rock and jungle” in his 1975 book The Great Railway Bazaar. Trains still run over this bridge every day, the steel towers suspending riders above the deep ravine.","The trains run once per day in each direction. Total journey time between Mandalay to Lashio exceeds 15 hours. Upper class fares for the full journey is about $6, less for shorter journeys. The main towns served by this train are Mandalay and Pyin U Lwin south of the viaduct, and Hsipaw and Lashio north of the viaduct. For Northbound Trains: The viaduct is north of Mandalay and Pyin U Lwin. Take the train from either of those stations. It is best to sit on the left side of the train in this direction. Tickets sellers usually assign upper class seats on the left side without asking. For Southbound Trains: The two largest towns north of the viaduct are Hsipaw and Lashio. It is best to sit on the right side of the train in this direction. Tickets sellers usually assign upper class seats on the left side without asking. Ticket sales begin at the stations one hour before scheduled departure. Foreigners must produce their passports to purchase a ticket."
62,Rih Dil,Myanmar (Burma),This heart-shaped lake near the border of India and Myanmar is deeply rooted in Mizo folklore.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rih-dil-lake,"Mizoram, a state in Northeast India, shares a border with Myanmar and Bangladesh, and is renowned for its dense forest cover and the diverse tribal origins of its population. The Mizo people are an ethnic group indigenous to Mizoram and its surrounding areas, which includes parts of Myanmar and Bangladesh. Rih Dil is a heart-shaped lake (word Dil means Heart) deeply rooted in Mizo history, culture, and folklores. According to the Mizo customs, newlywed couples visit the lake to seek blessing and pray for a long marriage. Mizo ancestral tribes also consider the Rih Dil Lake as the gateway to Pialral, or “beyond the world.” It is believed that all souls destined to Pialral must pass through the lake. In Mizo folklore, the formation of Rih Dil was tied to a young girl by the name of Rih-i. She had a cruel stepmother, who convinced Rih-i’s father to get rid of her and her younger sister. Their father killed the younger girl by cutting off her head. When Rih-i found her sister, she was heartbroken. The desolate girl was spotted by a fairy who inquired about her sadness. Upon hearing her story, the fairy asked Rih-i to go to the forest and find a branch with only one leaf. The fairy showed Rih-i how to use the leaf to revive her sister. When her sister was thirsty, Rih-i took used the magic leaf again to transform herself into a stream. Today, the place where Rih-i changed herself into the water came to be known as Rih Dil. Although Rih-Dil Lake has so much cultural and historical importance in Mizoram, the lake doesn’t actually lie in the state. Before the India-Myanmar Border was carved out, the lake was in India, but today it lies four kilometers (2.5 miles) over the border in Myanmar. But Indian citizens can easily visit the lake—the free movement policy allows citizens on the India-Myanmar border to visit the neighboring countries without any visa restrictions. This enables the Mizo community to visit Rih Dil no matter which country they live in. The trading post of Zokthawar is the nearest town to Rih Dil, and Aizwal, the capital of Mizoram, is located some 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the lake. Visiting Rih Dil Lake is a memorable experience that showcases the pristine beauty of the region.","Visiting Rih Dil requires a lot of patience as the roads are in very bad shape. Visiting lake in the monsoon seasons further increases the trouble as the region receives some of the highest rainfall in the country. The best time to visit the lake is the post-monsoon season when the entire area gets covered under a green blanket of vegetation. Also, carry mosquito repellent while visiting during or post-monsoon season."

Each temple is extremely ornate and richly decorated with gold and vibrant prayer flags, though it’s not only the spiritual décor that draws visitors. This sacred pilgrimage site is also home to hundreds of monkeys considered holy to Tibetan Buddhists and Hindus. According to legend, Manjushree, the bodhisattva of wisdom, was in the process of raising the temple hill when the lice in his hair transformed into these monkeys. Swayambhunath means self-arisen and is derived from that legend. The story alone provides enough inspiration for visitors to struggle through the climb to the temple, and the sights at the summit are worth the trek. From the top of the hill, visitors can see a panorama of the Kathmandu valley, along with playful monkeys swinging from trees and prayer flags hanging around the colorful temple. Although the monkeys are somewhat active during the day, the stupa truly becomes a monkey temple at night when hundreds of monkeys frolic in the sacred area and even slide down the banister of the primary structure.","The temple is easily accessible by foot, bike, or taxi from Kathmandu."

Though the garden was severely neglected following his death in 1964, the exquisitely manicured landscapes and the surviving fountains, pergolas, and pavilions have since been restored to their former glory. The four-acre Garden of Dreams in Kathmandu was designed by landscape architect Kishore Narshingh to mimic Edwardian-era English gardens. Most notably, the site was characterized by six pavilions, which symbolized the “six seasons” of Nepal: spring, early summer, the summer monsoon season, early autumn, late autumn, and winter. In its heyday, the garden was considered one of the most remarkable feats of landscape design in the country. Today, visitors will only find three pavilions on just over an acre of land, but the 74,000 square-foot space remains a verdant attraction thanks to a restoration project spearheaded by the Austrian government and Nepal Ministry of Education. Through the garden’s original gates are picturesque fountains and ponds, an amphitheater, isolated gardens of varying sizes, and the Kaiser Café Restaurant & Bar. Meandering pathways are lined with hedges, plants, trees, and flowers from all over the world, complemented by charming stone urns and intricate benches that offer contemplative vistas.

The huge offering site quickly become an focal point of worship and offering in the area. The structure of the building consists of a giant dome, on the top which sits a Buddhist pyramid tower. All of this sits on top of huge steps shaped like mandalas themselves. Originally the stupa’s spot was on an important trade route which allowed for a steady stream of possible converts. Among the Nepalese in Kathmandu, the stupa is simply referred to as “Chorten Chenpo” which translates to “Great Tower” or just “Great Stupa.” No matter what pilgrims called it, they flocked to the monument in droves. Despite having existed for years, the site did not truly become the center of Tibetan Buddhism until the 1950s as refugees from China immigrated over to Katmandu. Temples and devotional sites began to spring up throughout the surrounding city and further far afield, strengthening the power and importance of the site immeasurably. While it is hard to determine their specific age, the base of the stupa tower is decorated with pairs of eyes on each of the cardinal directions representing the all-knowing nature of the Buddha.

Despite its purported provenance, it did not pass inspection. The half football-shaped scalp sits in a cabinet at the temple, or gomba, of the village called Khumjung, and for a few Nepalese rupees the monks will take out a small, glass-fronted box containing the scruffy-haired dome. But no matter how much the donation, the scalp stays in the padlocked box. The relic is purported by the village to have come from one of the “abominable snowmen” of Himalayan legend and was found by Hillary and journalist Desmond Doig in 1960 when they were on an expedition to look for evidence of the big-footed beast. They found the scalp in the home of old Khumjung woman, who said it was a good-luck charm for the village and was anxious about letting it leave. In order to avoid disaster befalling the village, Hillary agreed to a deal: If he made a donation to the monastery and a local school and took with him a guardian for the scalp from the gomba, they would let it leave and be examined. The scalp turned out to have been fashioned from the hide of an animal, most likely a goat-antelope native to the Himalayas. After its trip and reported debunking, it was returned safely to the monastery; you can read more about that, as well as the duplicate of the scalp at New York’s Explorer’s Club, here, then make up your own mind if they really exist or not. As Khumjo Chumbi, the monk who was charged with watching over the scalp on its round-the-world voyage, told the Guardian newspaper at the time, “We don’t believe in giraffes and lions in Nepal because there aren’t any there. Likewise, you don’t believe in yetis because you have none in your country.”","Khumjung is in northeastern Nepal, about 85 miles east of Kathmandu (as the crow flies) and inside Sagarmatha National Park World Heritage Site, an uphill side-trip from the trekking route between Namche and Gorak Shep.

69,Kathmandu Durbar Square,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This historic square in Nepal is home to temples dating back to the third century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kathmandu-durbar-square,"Kathmandu Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of three squares within Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. Durbar Square (durbar translates to “palace” or “a court held by a prince”) is an important site for Buddhist and Hindu rituals, holy ceremonies, royal events, and kingly coronations. Surrounded by fountains, ancient statues, small ponds, and a series of courtyards such as Mohan Chok and Sundari Chok, Kathmandu Durbar Square is a meditative, religious site for spiritual seekers. Within the inner complex of Durbar Square is the site of the Old Royal Palaces (referred to as the Hanuman Dhoka Palace Complex). The Royal Palaces used to house the kings of the Shah and Malla Dynasty, who ruled over the city until the 19th-century. The palaces have since been turned into museums. The outer complex consists of numerous pagoda-style temples featuring the meticulously carved facades crafted by Newar artists, some of which date back to the 16th-century. Under the direction of the Malla Kings, Durbar Square underwent a series of changes and new architectural additions. King Mahendra Malla (1560–1574) commissioned the construction of the oldest temples in Durbar Square. Built in the Newari architectural style, his contributions included the Jagannath Temple, Kotilingeshwara Mahadev (a stone temple of Lord Shiva), the Mahendreswara Temple, and the magnificent Taleju Temple (the largest and perhaps most important temple of them all). Although these date back to the 16th-century, it’s believed that construction for the square itself and the palaces began as early as the 3rd-century. Later, King Pratap Malla added more additions to the square, including shrines and new temples, and also restored many of the older temples. When he passed away in 1674, new constructions stopped, but picked up again during the Shah Dynasty. One of the most unusual sites built during the Shah Dynasty is the nine-storied structure called the Nautale, commonly referred to as Basantapur Durbar. Located at the east side of the palace, the structure has four roofs and was rumored to be a “pleasure house.” Other popular temples in the square include Mahadev Temple, Shiva Parvati Temple, Maru Ganesh, Bhagwati Temple, Saraswati temple, octagonal Krishna Temple, Jagannath Temple, and the Kal Bhairav (which represents the destructor form of Lord Shiva). Perhaps the most peculiar (and revered) sites at the southern edge of Kathmandu Durbar Square is the three-storied temple called Kumari Bahal. This Newari temple, built by the last Malla king Jayaprakash Malla, houses the Kumari Devi–a young girl chosen through a highly selective process and believed to be the living embodiment of the Hindu mother goddess. The Kumari Devi is paraded around the square in a custom-made gilded chariot during the festival of Indra Jatra and others, and worshipped by the people, who carefully watch her for specific signs that may allude to their fortune and fate. After a devastating earthquake-plagued the area in 2015, many of the ancient temples and historic pagoda-style structures were severely damaged.

In fact, Bhaktapur is among the most intact ancient cities in Nepal. It was also given the distinction of being listed as a UNESCO world heritage site.",
71,The Toothache Tree,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Nailing a coin to this holy stump is just another way to ask the gods for relief from dental pain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-toothache-tree-kathmandu-nepal,"The gnarled hunk of wood known as Vaisha Dev, or the Toothache Tree, sits at an unassuming chowk (intersection) just past Thahiti Tole, but visitors could be forgiven for not realizing that it is a tree stump since locals making an offering to the god of sore teeth have covered it in nailed on coins. Said to be a cutting from a legendary tree known as Bangemudha, the chunk of wood that has been put in place smack in the heart of Kathmandu’s dental district, which is home to a concentration of orthodontists’ offices, acts as a sort of wishing well. People with toothaches or other dental ailments visit the site and nail coin to the tree as an offering to Vaishya Dev, the Newar god of the toothache. Supposedly there is a teeny tiny little idol inside of the main hole of the tooth god’s shrine, although the coins nailed on every part of the log obscure any view into the burl. In fact, the log is so covered that none of the actual wood is visible anymore either. The superstitious site is as attractive to worshippers as it is to the dental professionals all around it. As people with tooth problems come to visit the shrine the hope is that they will be lured in by one of the brightly-colored signs advertising the dentists in the area. Orthodontists know an opportunity when they see one (generally in the mouths of candy-crushing twelve-year-olds).",
72,Annapurna,"Khangsar, Nepal","Named after the Goddess of Harvests, Annapurna is the deadliest member of the Eight-thousanders club.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eight-thousander-mountain-annapurna,"There are 14 independent peaks that make up the “Eight-thousanders”, an elite group of mountains that tower more than 8,000 meters (26,247 ft) above sea level, all of which lie in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges in Asia. The most popular of these mountains, Mount Everest, has taken the life of many a brave or foolhardy explorer, but there is another Eight-thousander that makes Everest look like a kiddie ride. Her name is Annapurna. Since the first recorded ill-fated expedition of Albert F. Mummery and J. Norman Collie in 1895, men and women have been compelled to conquer these peaks, and ironically the first successful ascent was located on Annapurna by famed adventurers Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal in 1950. The expedition was successful, but not without a heavy cost – Herzog lost the majority of his fingers and toes to frostbite, and to stave off gangrene had to perform amputations on the mountain, sans anesthetic. No one dared to climb Annapurna again for 20 years. Annapurna is not the tallest mountain – in fact, it’s 10th tallest on the list of the 14. Yet it currently has a fatality-to-summit ratio of 38% which, though recently improved from 40%, is still the highest fatality rate of any of the Eight-thousanders. Why it claims so many lives is uncertain, although the glacial architecture and the illusions it produces have been cited as examples of its treachery. Whatever the reason, this quiet giant with the difficult south slope has called over 200 explorers to her snowy cliffs, and decided to keep over 50 of them as her own.",
73,Rinchenling Gompa,"Muchu, Nepal",This remote Himalayan temple is in danger of being completely washed away by a melting glacier.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rinchenling-gompa,"Jettisoned straight out of Middle Earth and onto our planet, the Rinchenling Gompa is quite an otherworldly place. Located on the banks of a small tributary of the Limi River, the Halji Gompa is undoubtedly one of the highest temples in the world (approximately 3,600 meters). Adding to the Gompa’s ethereal qualities is its setting: Limi Valley, one of the most remote, and starkly beautiful regions of Himalayan Nepal. The Rinchenling Gompa sits inside Halji Village, one of three small communities within Limi Valley. Access to electricity and warmth are difficult here. Small solar panels, along with a miniature hydro-electric plant provide light only during specified hours of the night. Warmth is provided by burning cow dung in hearths in each of the homes. It’s that remote. Because Limi Valley is right up against the border with Tibet, the Tibetan language is spoken and Tibetan religious customs are practiced in lieu of more Nepali traditions. The Rinchenling Gompa was said to be founded by Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055), an early translator of Buddhist texts into the Tibetan language. Rinchen Zangpo was one of the fathers of the “Second Dissemination” in which Buddhism was reintroduced to Tibet by leading scholars around the beginning of the 11th century. He is said to have established over 108 temples in his lifetime alone. While it is hard to gauge the veracity of these claims, recent C-14 dating of the Vairocana statue inside the temple point to a range in the early 11th century, well within Rinchen Zangpo’s lifetime. In recent years, the Rinchenling Gompa has been threatened by flooding. In 2011, a glacial lake high above Halji Village burst, resulting in a flood that caused significant damage to many structures in Halji Village. Though no one was harmed during the flooding, the risk presented is severe. Without adequate restoration and protection, the Rinchenling Gompa is extremely susceptible to flood damages. A more serious flood could completely wash away over 1,000 years of history. International conservation organizations are starting to take notice, however, so there is some hope that the Gompa will receive the protection it deserves.","Physical fitness and experience traveling in developing countries are critical to accessing Rinchenling Gompa. It is roughly a six day walk from the nearest airstrip in Simikot over highly exposed trails. Accommodations are either the Halji Village guesthouse, or camping facilities."
74,Taragaon Museum,"Kathmandu, Nepal","This Kathmandu museum, built in an Austrian modernist style, looks like a set from Star Wars.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taragaon-museum,"For many, thinking of Kathmandu conjures images of towering pagoda-style temples and narrow streets choked with exotic, medieval era architecture. But after the city was opened to foreigners in the 1950s, Kathmandu’s landscape began to change. The Taragaon Museum not only chronicles the city’s architectural transformation, but also embodies it. Originally built as a hostel for visiting artists and scientists, the Taragaon grew into a well-known hotel that was later abandoned in the 1990s. The property was rescued by hotelier and philanthropist Arun Saraf, who also owns the adjacent Hyatt hotel, and was revived to honor Kathmandu’s architectural history. The Austrian architect Carl Pruscha, who served as a UN and UNESCO consultant to the Nepalese government, designed the Taragaon in the 1960s based on the artistic vision provided by Angur Baba Joshi. A prominent social activist, Joshi was an Oxford-educated Nepali woman who dreamed of promoting Nepal’s heritage by developing a cultural village. The resulting combination of Pruscha’s European modernism and Nepali traditions spawned a unique structure. Dark red brick dominates the museum’s design as a tribute to the dachi appa brick structures that can be found throughout Kathmandu’s historic districts. The bricks are typically used for the façades of Newari temples and palaces. The barrel-vaulted style rooms, which Pruscha calls “Pati,” were likewise inspired by classic temple architecture. Other elements of the recent restoration are distinctly modern, like the large, circular windows, which are meant as a nod toward the future. Inside, the museum is bedecked with photos, drawings, and sketches of Nepal’s architectural bounty. Two of the oldest items on display are an 1853 etching and an 1863 photograph of Kathmandu. These are complemented by colorful topographic maps and paintings as well as modern sculpture by Nepali artists.",The Taragaon Museum is on the grounds of the Hyatt hotel and is within easy walking distance from Boudha Stupa.  Entry is free.
75,Nyatapola Temple,"Bhaktapur, Nepal","Towering at a height of over 30 meters, this turn-of-the-18th-century landmark is the tallest temple in Nepal.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nyatapola-temple,"The imposing Nyatapola Temple stands five tiers tall over Taumadhi Square in the Nepalese city of Bhaktapur, where it was built with time-tested virtuosity at the behest of King Bhupatindra Malla in 1702. While the temple is indeed a splendid relic of treasured Nepalese history, the building’s structure is so solid that it withstood an 8.3 earthquake in 1934, followed by another in 2015, without any significant architectural damage. This exquisite, pagoda-style edifice comprised of wood and brick, and adorned with magnificent carvings was named Nyatapola after the local Newari words for “five-stepped” (nyata) and “roof” (pola). The building maintains associations with the deities Bhairava—a ferocious incarnation of the Lord Shiva—and, principally, Siddhi Lakshmi, the Tantric incarnation of “the invincible” goddess Durga, to whom Nyatapola is dedicated. According to local legend, at a time when Bhairava threatened civilization with annihilation, a desperate king called upon Parvati, the goddess of love, fertility, and beauty. In the form of Siddhi Lakshmi, she thwarted Bhairava with Nyatapola: a far more powerful temple than Bhairava’s neighboring shrine in Taumadhi Square. The original chapel dedicated to Bhairava was a humble construction, added to over time. The temple was destroyed in the earthquake that occurred in 1934 and had to be rebuilt, with a third tier added during reconstruction. Within the sublime Nyatapola Temple is a shrine dedicated to Siddhi Lakshmi, which is purportedly so formidable that it’s been reserved exclusively for temple priests since it was forged. Additional likenesses of Siddhi Lakshmi can be found in details across the temple—above doors and across the roof’s framework. Visitors egress the temple via a brick stairway guarded by five pairs of sculpted deities of ascending power: first, the wrestlers Jayamel and Phattu, believed to have possessed superhuman strength; followed by elephants, lions, then gryphons; and finally, just before the temple doors, the goddesses Baghini—the “Tigress,”—and Singhini—the “Lioness.” Nyatapola was one of several temples built in the states of Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kathmandu during the 18th century. Today, all three former states comprise the Kathmandu Valley, also known as the Valley of the Temples.","The Nyatapola Temple is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, though visitors to the temple during a Nepalese festival or holiday should check beforehand to make sure it's open to the public."
76,Ranibari Community Forest,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This conservation area filled with colorful birds is the last community forest within the city of Kathmandu.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ranibari-community-forest,"Long-time residents of the Kathmandu Valley often lament the concrete jungle their city has become, but one green hillock in the shadow of the Himalayan foothills has been preserved. Once the site of religious retreats for Nepal’s kings, the Ranibari Community Forest is now an oasis of nature with footpaths that explore 17 acres of densely forested parkland. The forest is most notable for the abundance of birds that make it their home, with more than 67 species regularly spotted here. Visitors can easily spy Alexandrine parakeets fluttering colorfully through the trees, black kites arguing with crows, or scarlet minivets frolicking in the canopy. And the extravagantly tailed red-billed blue magpies are one of the highlights of any birding trip to the forest. Fittingly, Bird Conservation Nepal has developed the forest as a bird and biodiversity conservation learning center. Two main trails encircle the forest, one at the base which staves off the ever encroaching city development, and one that circles the top of the hill allowing views of the city and Himalayas beyond. Also at the top of the hill is a small Ranidevi temple with murti dedicated to Shiva, Krishna, and Ganesh. Otherwise, the forest is the domain of native flora and fauna. Nepal launched the community forest program in 1973 and currently there are nearly 20,000 forests across the country. The Kathmandu Valley region has 144 community forests, but Ranibari is the only one within the boundary of the Ring Road that encircles the cities of Kathmandu and Patan. Anyone looking for a respite from the functional anarchy of Kathmandu’s crowded city center will undoubtedly find nirvana tucked in the Ranibari forest.","The forest is free to enter before 9:30 a.m., but costs the princely sum of 10 rupees thereafter."
77,Lukla Airport,"Chaurikharka, Nepal",Jumping-off point for a climb up Mt. Everest is the most dangerous airport in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lukla-airport,"The little town of Lukla is the starting point of almost all trekking journeys in the Khumbu region. Situated at an altitude of 2,860 meters, Lukla is the first site that trekkers get introduced to when visiting Khumbu. It is a collection of small houses and hotels that are scattered within proximity to the region’s only airport- the Tenzing Hillary Airport. Because of its prominence, Lukla has transformed from a small farming community to a commercial hub of the region that is on par with Namche Bazaar. Due to trekkers staying overnight at Lukla during Everest Treks, the town has seen a rise in the number of luxury guesthouses and hotels in recent years. From Kathmandu, it takes about 40 minutes to reach Lukla via plane. Also famously known as the Lukla Airport, the Tenzing Hillary Airport is a small airport that is often referred to as one of the most dangerous airports in the world. The airport is among the most famous transport connection between the rest of Nepal and the Everest Mountains, with other ways of reaching Khumbu are long days of trekking. Daily flights occur to/from the airport during daylight hours and in good weather conditions. In contrast to Kathmandu’s steady sun-shining, Lukla often experiences rainfall, sometimes simultaneously with the lack of rain in other parts of the country. Lukla’s topographical position in the mountain gives way to high winds, dense cloud cover, and changing visibility. This, as a result, often leads to flight delays or the airport being closed. The Lukla Airport was built in 1964. The construction was done under the supervision of Sir Edmund Hillary, and until recently in 2001, the airport runway wasn’t even properly paved. It was renamed in 2008 in honor of Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, the first people to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. The runway is 527 meters long and 30 meters wide and the airport is used mostly for passenger flights and the transport of goods and cargo to Lukla and other villages in the north of the region, as there is no road access. The airplanes landing or taking off from the Lukla Airport must use a single runway. High terrain blocks the already low prospect of go-around on short final airplane approaches, and the runway ends in a steeply angled drop into the valley below. As such, landing and taking off from Lukla is difficult. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has, as a result, set high standards for which only experienced pilots who have completed at least 100 short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) missions are allowed to land at the airport. The pilots must also have over one year of STOL experience in Nepal and must have completed ten missions into Lukla with a certified instructor pilot. However, despite the difficulties, Lukla has one of the busiest domestic airports in Nepal. Accidents happen rarely, and the airport is considered one of the most beautiful airports in the world. It is surrounded by the mighty Himalayas and the towering emerald hills that shadow over the village. There is no use of air navigation or radar systems. Instead, for landing and take-offs, radio communication is used. The paved road is small and is only suitable for helicopters and small aircraft with fixed wings and short takeoffs.Landing at the Tenzing Hillary Airport begins from north to south, and takeoff is from south to north of the runway. Furthermore, the runway is secured by the Nepal Army and has a wired fence around it. Despite notoriously having the reputation as the most dangerous airport in the world, the Lukla Airport carried out about 20 or 30 aircraft landings every day during the peak seasons. Almost more than half the trekkers who visit Nepal annually tend to fly into Lukla. While the airport at Lukla is comparatively more dangerous statistically than a typical commercial airport, it is still pretty safe. The aviation officials of Nepal and local airlines are very strict on the acceptable flight conditions and regulations for aircraft making the journey to Lukla.  There are options available for trekking to Everest without flying. The alternate options include trekking to Lukla either from Jiri, Salleri or Kharihola. However, trekking to Lukla instead of flying takes about 3 to 8 days. Due to Lukla’s position and elevation, weather conditions and visibility are constantly dynamic and can change rapidly. Thus, flight schedules to Lukla can be difficult and are hard to predict. The airlines do not take chances with weather conditions and will return a flight to Kathmandu from anywhere along its journey rather than risk an unsafe landing if the weather conditions change since takeoff. As such, flight delays are very common. They can happen at any time of year but are especially likely to occur during the monsoon season (late May to early September). If your flight is delayed, then you will have to reschedule the next possible flight. Travel agencies take care of rescheduling for you if you are hiring them for treks. As conditions at Lukla can change so rapidly, rescheduling may be very soon after your scheduled departure, or it may take as much as a few days later- it is very difficult to predict. This, of course, can be pretty frustrating, but it is simply a part of the journey to the Everest region. It is strongly recommended to add at least a day or two to the end of the trip for flexibility in case of any delays. Extra days should always be scheduled at the end of the trip as this provides flexibility with the trekking itinerary in case of any weather delays.",You can get a cab in Kathmandu to get to the Tribhuvan International Airport. The cab fare can cost about NPR 1000. It is recommended to get to the airport at least one hour before your flight time.
78,Island Jungle Resort at Chitwan National Park,"Manahari, Nepal",Everything from a plane to your own two feet are needed to reach this jungle resort.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/island-jungle-resort-chitwan-national-park,"If you’re visiting Kathmandu, but need an escape from the bustling capital, the Island Jungle Resort in the Chitwan National Park is the place to go. Simply hop on a plane to Bharatpur (a more rural town), where the Lodge’s bus will pick you up and take you to their hotel for a hot buffet of Nepali food. At this point you might wonder if you’ve been ripped off, with the only “jungle-like” qualities being the hotel’s very green courtyard. But just wait. Once you finish your meal, you will be instructed to re-board the Lodge’s bus for a one-hour ride that goes through the hustle-bustle of Bharatpur to the surrounding villages, then the rural villages, barren fields, swampy areas, and then finally stops at what seems to be the final destination, a river. Here you will find a canoe waiting for you, that will take you across the river to meet your final guide, who leads you on a 10 minute walk through butterfly gardens to an oasis of huts, elephant rides, nature walks, and a full bar/restaurant, which make up the Island Jungle Resort. After the use of a plane, bus, canoe and your own two feet, you are finally there.",
79,Buddha Peace Park,"Mahamanjushree Nagarkot, Nepal",This park in Nagarkot boasts one of the best views in all of Nepal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buddha-peace-park,"An hour east of Kathmandu is the small resort community of Nagarkot. The road to reach the town is steep, twisty, and rough, making a stop at the Buddha Peace Park a welcome respite. Hikers may choose to finish the journey to Nagarkot by taking the eight-kilometer Peace Park Hiking Trail into town. The trail offers even more panoramic views of the Kathmandu Valley and the Himalayas beyond. Carved out of the side of the Himalayan foothills, the park can be reached by climbing a series of steep steps, but the vista is well worth the effort. Buddha looks over a valley with Kathmandu on one side, and the dazzling curvilinear striations of extensive terrace farms on the other. Behind the park, at the top of the hill, and above the clouds, the Himalayas are on full display. The golden statue positioned on the central plinth is a depiction of the “Earth Touching Buddha,” also known as the Buddha exhibiting the “Bhumisparsha Mudra.” In this pose, Buddha’s right-hand reaches toward the ground, and his middle finger touches the ground symbolizing the moment of his enlightenment. According to the backstory, while Buddha was meditating under a Bodhi tree, he was harangued by the demon Mara. Buddha called to the earth goddess to witness his enlightenment. The goddess responded by sending a flood to wash away Mara and allow Buddha to complete his spiritual journey. The earthly landscape surrounding Buddha is covered in picturesque terraced farms. In a country where crop yields are low and food insecurity is high, more than 13 million Nepalese depend on sustainable terrace farming. When viewed from a distance, the beauty and romance of the farms hide the incredibly hard work it takes to create and maintain the fields—work that is done entirely by hand and mostly by women. The nearby town of Nagarkot provides luxury hotel accommodations, as well as views of six of the world’s 14 highest mountain peaks. A special viewing platform was constructed specifically to watch the sunrise over Everest. Here, meditating visitors can replicate Buddha’s earth goddess invocation and absorb the unrivaled views.","The park is free to visit and is open 24 hours. If visitors are so inclined, they may plant a tree in the park in honor of a special occasion or in memory of a loved one. The cost is modest, $3-$4, and the park will nurture it to maturity."
80,Tiger Tops,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Host to the World Elephant Polo Championships since 1982.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tiger-tops,"These four-ton athletes are highly trained, well-kept polo machines. No more than two games are played per day, and no player is allowed to play those two games in a row. Games end at noon, and snacks and beverages are served at half-time—fresh cut grass and about 22 gallons of water. Daily baths in the river keep the competitors refreshed and clean. Since 1982, Tiger Tops has been hosting the World Elephant Polo Championships in Nepal, as well as serving as headquarters for the exotic variation on the popular sport. Fairly self-explanatory, the game consists of the basic polo guidelines with a few necessary changes to accommodate the size of the player’s mounts—a six-to-10-foot cane with a standard mallet head on the end, a pitch shortened to 3/4 the length to make up for the elephant’s lack of speed, and each elephant carries two riders who must rely on a mahout to do the steering as they shout out directions. Along with the altered guidelines come elephant-specific rules that must be put into play. An elephant who lies down in front of the goal mouth will receive a foul, and if they use their trunk to pick up the ball, that not only constitutes a foul, but earns their opponent a free hit. Rice balls enhanced with molasses and rock salt act as treats at the end of each match while riders are rewarded with a beer, and all games end by noon to avoid the afternoon heat. While there’s debate on whether these amazing animals should be used for sport at all, the World Elephant Polo Association (WEPA) keeps strict guidelines regarding the safety and well being of the elephants. PETA has targeted the sport, costing the organizations sponsorship withdrawals and the occasional match cancellation, and safety was put into question when two players were injured and the minibus of one of the visiting teams was destroyed when an elephant went on a rampage in 2007. Despite the controversy and criticism, Tiger Tops and WEPA maintain that their animals are happy, healthy, and enjoy the opportunity for social interaction and the break from their normal routine of giving safari rides to tourists. The tournament takes place every December on the edge of Chitwan National Park, and include 16 domesticated Asian elephants, half of them belonging to Tiger Tops and the others brought in by Nepal National Parks. The elephants are accompanied by their mahouts, who usually have been partnered with the animals for several years. Update as of December 2017: Tiger Tops no longer host elephant polo, although other events exist involving the elephants.",
81,Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve,"Bairawa, Nepal",Nepal’s last remaining population of wild water buffalo and many other rare species call this reserve home.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koshi-tappu-wildlife-reserve,"In Nepal’s southeastern region of Terai, the Sapta Koshi River, a tributary of the Ganges, is the lifeblood of a 43,000-acre wildlife reserve. Known today for hosting nearly 500 bird species, the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve was originally established to protect the last remaining population of Asian wild buffalos in Nepal. The Asian buffalo has been endangered for decades and current worldwide numbers stand around 4,000. When the reserve was established in 1976, Nepal had a total population of 63. Today, some 500 buffalo can be found in Koshi Tappu. In addition to the buffalos, Koshi Tappu is known for the successful management of wetlands that support other threatened species. The Ganges river dolphin numbers, for example, have started to increase in the region especially in the Koshi River. Interestingly, India conferred “non-human person” status on the species in 2013 to further protect them. Another endangered species, the Gharial crocodile, was declared extinct in the Koshi River in 1970, but as of 2019, they have been sighted once again in the reserve. Cooperation between Nepal and India, as well as a partnership with the Frankfurt Zoo, has brought the crocodile back from the brink. In 2006, only 250 Gharial crocodiles were thought to exist in the wild, but the new sightings in Koshi Tappu indicate a recovery. Notably, the reserve was declared a Ramsar site in 1987, and in 1998, the reserve began aggressively addressing problems of poaching and encroachment by domestic animals. Unfortunately, surveys have indicated that a lack of support for conservation efforts continues to hinder progress. Researchers however have identified areas of development for nature and culture-based recreational tourism that may provide solutions to increasing conservation efforts.","The Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve can be easily reached from Biratnagar, Nepal.  Generally, the best time to visit is October through March. The Koshi Tappu Wildlife Camp offers guided tours including rafting and jeep safaris through Explore Nepal, Ltd."
82,Annapurna Natural History Museum Butterfly Collection,"Pokhara, Nepal",Feast your eyes upon hundreds of Nepal's native butterflies and moths.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/annapurna-natural-history-museum-butterfly-collection,"Pokhara has its fair share of museums, but the Annapurna Butterfly Museum truly makes the heart flutter. The butterfly museum is tucked away on the second floor of a building in the Prithivi Narayan University campus, which also has a small natural history and environmental museum (and possibly the world’s worst taxidermy leopard). The museum displays nearly all of Nepal’s 660 native species of butterfly and moth. Wonderful handmade dioramas display the medley of moths and butterflies. The dioramas and the meticulous index show the regions of Nepal in which the winged critters were found. Other butterflies are preserved under glass in wooden drawers and are grouped by related species. Exploring the drawers is a fun box-of-chocolates way to become acquainted with the stunning variety of native moths and butterflies of this diverse and unique biosphere, especially before taking off on a trek to visit their living relatives. A highlight of the collection is Attacus atlas, the largest moth in the world by wingspan. But if you don’t see the massive moth, admiring the many mountain and tropical butterflies displayed in this curated, meticulously organized collection is still a treat.","The museum is located about 4.5 miles (seven kilometers) from the main tourist district of Lakeside. Entry is donation based, and generally open during normal business hours, which can be somewhat unpredictable in Nepal. It's accessible via bike, bus, or taxi and is walkable from the Seti River Gorge if you visit there as well."

The temple’s age is not exactly certain, but legend indicates its existence to date back to 400 BC. The complex includes 518 temples, buildings, and structures. The main temple is designed as a pagoda structure, located within the fortified courtyard, and guarded by Nepalese military force and semi-military Nepali police. Features of the main pagoda include carved wooden rafters, cubic sculptures, with two-level roofs covered with copper and gold sheets. Four main doors to the pagoda are covered with silver sheets, while the pinnacle is gold. The temple has two interior rooms where the Pashupatinath (AKA Shiva) idol is placed. Near the temple’s western door stands a bronze statue of Nandi bull, the sacred vehicle or vahana of Shiva. Temples in the complex are designed in Vaishnav (Vishnu) and Shaiva (Shiva) tradition. The main idol is a stone deity with four faces representing Shiva’s various aspects, Sadyojata (or Barun), Vamadeva (or Ardhanareshwara), Tatpurusha, Aghora & Ishana (imaginative). Facing the four directions as well as zenith, they represent the five primary elements (earth, water, air, light, and ether). Unlike other Shiva lingams in India and Nepal, this Pashupati Shiva idol is always in its golden cover except during prayer. Pouring milk and water from the Ganges river (ganga jal) which are standard acts of Hindu ritualistic worship is possible only during the abhisheka prayer times and conducted only by the main priests. The Pashupatinath idol can be touched only by the main Bhatt priests while the Bhandari priests assist the Bhatt priests during daily pooja worship rituals.","The April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the Pashupatinath temple complex, where some of the outer buildings were severely damaged. Only practicing Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains of Indian origin are allowed into the inner temple courtyard. Hindus of western descent and non-Hindus are given restricted entry to the temple courtyard. Take a taxi from Kathmandu city center to Pashupatinath, which will cost around $15. Guides cost about $10 while a non-Hindu can enter the temple for a $10 entrance fee. The inner temple courtyard is open from 4 AM to 7 PM, while the inner temple is open from 5 AM to 12 noon for morning worship and viewing and then 5 PM to 7 PM for the evening prayer and viewing."

There is also an exhibition about the legend of the Yeti, beliefs and facts about the abominable snowman—which they recognize is probably a Tibetan brown bear. On a clear day, visitors will have a wonderful view on the Annapurna mountain range in the northwest, quite appropriate for the theme of the museum. Outside, there is a “living museum” dedicated to the diverse tribes and indigenous people of Nepal, their cultures and their homes. Nepal is an extremely diverse nation, with as many as 125 different castes and ethnic groups. Clothes and crafts from many of these different groups are on display at the museum.

But those who take the time to wander around the park will find many more curious marvels. Measuring 67 feet tall, the central statue that dominates the landscape is of Shakyamuni Buddha, the historical Buddha who began life as Siddhartha Gautama. This portrayal is the Amitābha (or Amideva) form of the Buddha, who is associated with longevity. He holds a giant bowl in his hands, which contains the nectar of immortality. To the left of Shakyamuni Buddha is the 64-foot-tall Chenrezig (also known as Avalokitesvara), the “one who looks with unwavering eye.” He is the most compassionate of all Bodhisattvas, and those who utter the mantra “Om Mani Padme Hum” invoke his assistance. He is depicted with many arms which he uses to reach out to help the multitudes in need. The Dalai Lama is considered an incarnation of Chenrezig. To the right of Shakyamuni Buddha, also at 64 feet tall, is Guru Rinpoche (aka Guru Padmasambhava), “The Precious Master.” Incarnated as a fully enlightened being, Guru Rinpoche is a keeper of primordial wisdom and revealed to the world the complete Vajrayana (tantric) teachings. The statues are encircled by prayer wheels. Walking behind them reveals a great many additional treasures including an ornate stupa, a chörten containing an enormous prayer wheel, intricate artwork around the base of the statues, and the occasional rooster. Of particular interest are the sculptural recreations of sacred mountains including Kailashnath, the mountain where Shiva is said to reside. To one side of Kailashnath is a large golden shiva lingam, which may or may not be considered a phallic symbol, depending on the information source. Despite its size and religious significance, this park gets far fewer visitors than other sites around Kathmandu. A stop here can provide both a respite from the chaos of the city and a chance to take a quiet step toward enlightenment.","Although local opportunists may attempt to extract a fee from visitors, the park is free to enter."
86,Changu Narayan,"Changunarayan, Nepal","Dating back to the fourth century, it's the oldest Hindu temple still in use in the Kathmandu Valley.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/changu-narayan,"Changu Narayan is a two-story pagoda-style temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu and surrounded by ancient carvings and statues. Having survived destruction in 1702 and 2015, it is said to be the oldest Hindu temple still in use in the Kathmandu Valley today. The entire Kathmandu Valley is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, encompassing seven groups of monuments and buildings. These include the Durbar Squares of Hanuman Dhoka (Kathmandu), Patan and Bhaktapur; the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath; and the Hindu temples of Pashupati and Changu Narayan. Dating back to the fourth century, Changu Narayan is widely considered to be the oldest Hindu temple in Bhaktapur, and one of the oldest in Nepal. Built on top of a high hill about seven miles directly east of Kathmandu, the temple is dedicated to Vishnu, although shrines to Lord Shiva, Ashta Matrika, Chhinnamasta, Kileshwor, and Krishna are also found within the wider temple complex. The main temple is decorated with some of the finest carvings in the Kathmandu Valley, and the collection of statues surrounding the temple is the best you’ll see outside the National Museum of Nepal. The diagonal beams that support the temple’s two pagoda roofs are decorated with intricate carvings of the 10 incarnations of Vishnu and various multi-armed Tantric goddesses. The temple’s four entrances, meanwhile, are guarded by stone lions, griffins, elephants, and sarabhas (part-lion, part-bird creatures from Hindu mythology). But the gems of the collection are the statues and carvings dotted around the courtyard, the oldest dating back to the Licchavi era (400 to 750). Facing the west door of the temple is a statue of Garuda, the legendary bird that served as Vishnu’s mount, which dates back to the fifth century. And near this statue is the oldest stone inscription in the Kathmandu Valley, a message etched in 464 that tells the tale of how a king convinced his mother not to die by suicide after her husband’s death. Other statues show Vishnu in his various incarnations, or avatars. Vishnu appears as Narsingha, the man-lion, ripping a man apart with his fingers. He also appears as Vikrantha, the six-armed dwarf who transformed into a giant. And in the northwest corner of the complex is an image of Vishnu riding his faithful mount Garuda. The temple complex and its numerous statues have survived a number of threats over the centuries. The most serious was a fire that swept through the compound in 1702, destroying many works. The temple was rebuilt in the following years. More recently, the Gorkha Earthquake of April 2015 damaged 753 temples, shrines, and monasteries across Nepal, including 241 in Kathmandu. Changu Narayan suffered heavy damage but restoration projects began almost immediately. It was reopened the same year, and the Department of Archeology announced that the restoration project had been completed in November 2017. Visitor numbers declined following the earthquake, and have yet to return to pre-quake levels.","Changu Narayan is located about seven miles east of Kathmandu. From Kathmandu you can take the bus to Bhaktapur, then take another bus to the temple. There's also a museum located on the way up to the temple. Inside the temple complex you are free to explore most of the grounds, but only priests can enter the main temple. The entrance fee for foreign nationals is 300 Nepalese rupees ($2.60 US)."
87,Apollo Lunar Sample Displays,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Visitors to the National Museum of Nepal can moon over a set of well-traveled flags.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/apollo-lunar-sample-displays,"When the astronauts of Apollo 11 went to the moon, they brought along flags from each of the 50 states and all U.S. territories, as well as from 135 countries to hand out as goodwill souvenirs upon their return, along with small samples from the moon’s surface. In 1972, the crew of Apollo 17 did the same. Today, Nepal is one of 29 countries to still have both. You can find them at the National Museum of Nepal, tucked in a small corner next to a rhinoceros skull. The display from Apollo 11 includes four grains of moon dust in acrylic casing, while the one from Apollo 17 has a small moon rock. These celestial accessories were created by NASA at the request of U.S. President Richard Nixon and were intended to promote world peace. Over the years, many of these lunar display samples have gone missing or turned up on the black market, some selling for millions of dollars. It is estimated that of the 270 flag keepsakes, the whereabouts of 180 are unknown. As a result, a cottage industry to find these missing rocks was spawned, led by Joseph Gutheinz who became known as “The Moon Rock Hunter” for Operation Lunar Eclipse, a sting operation to stop the sale of bogus moon rocks. These relics of the U.S. space program are far from the only things worth visiting at the National Museum of Nepal. Exhibitions are housed in three sizable buildings: one dedicated to the art of Nepal, another a gallery devoted to Buddhism, and the third (where the flags are displayed), that focuses on natural and cultural history. The art gallery features works in stone, metal, wood, and on canvas, tracing nearly 2,000 years of art and history in the Kathmandu Valley and beyond. (Pride of place goes to a 2nd century stone sculpture of King Jayavarma which has one of the earliest inscriptions in Nepal.) The Buddhist gallery is expertly curated to teach visitors of all ages about the religion while surrounded by the enchanting trappings of monasteries. And the natural history building is replete with bones, taxidermy, and dioramas that will fascinate and perplex.","Despite its name, the National Museum is not usually listed as a main attraction in Kathmandu. It is off the beaten path away from more famous sights, but it is easy to find on Museum Marg, about a 20 minute walk west of Durbar Square."
88,Raithaane,"Lalitpur, Nepal",This restaurant preserves and serves lesser-known and regional Nepali food.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/raithaane,"Nepali cuisine is often depicted or known for—especially abroad—only a few dishes, such as momos, dumplings, and dal bhat, a staple meal of lentil soup, rice, pickles, mixed vegetables, and occasionally meat. But Raithaane has neither momos nor dal bhat, nor does it serve much resembling the food found in restaurants around Kathmandu. The diverse menu includes pork-rich dishes from Eastern Nepali communities, stews from northern Sherpas, black lentil patties from the west, and battered deep-fried vegetables from the south. Opened in late 2018, Raithaane highlights these dishes to preserve the country’s gastronomical heritage and to educate Nepalis on their country’s complicated and varied gastronomical traditions. With a population of 28 million and 125 distinct ethnic groups, it’s no small endeavor. Started by three food-obsessives, two Nepali and one French, they mix of ingredients to give customers a taste of Nepali food they might have never encountered. To serve these dishes, some of which rely on traditional grains and produce that are disappearing in favor of foreign imports, the Raithaane team works with local farmers and the agricultural system. Their goal is to highlight and help create demand for soon-to-be-lost Nepali ingredients that sustained the country for centuries. That said, the chefs are not slaves to tradition, mixing cheese from yak milk into Nepali buckwheat gallettes, and the restaurant’s sweets—especially a pie made of juju dhau, or strained buffalo yoghurt—have inspired a small cult following.","Peel your eyes when looking for Raithaane. The restaurant is not visible from the unnamed lane on which it sits, tucked in the southwestern corner of a small courtyard. There is a small blackboard on the street, however. Also be aware that Raithaane follows a highly seasonal menu, so may not have every dish on its menu at all times. Hours have also varied due to the pandemic, though there are now take-out and delivery options, so be sure to check the restaurant's Facebook page for updates."
89,Nyālon (Fish Stone),"Kathmandu, Nepal",This small shrine dedicated to a fish is believed to hold the secrets to this historic market's founding.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nyalon-fish-stone,"Walking from Thamel, the main tourist district of Kathmandu, to historic Durbar Square, one will pass through the bustling market of Asan Tole. Amid the crowds and teeming stalls are several temples and shrines including a tikka-ed stone fish coyly hiding in plain sight. The fish is easily overlooked since the adjacent Ganesh and Annapurna temples garner more attention. However, according to at least one legend, the Asan bazaar owes its name to a fish that fell at the location of the shrine. The origin of the name Asan is shrouded in mystery, but some believe it derives from the Newari word ansaa meaning “just there” or “nearby.” As the story goes, a fish once fell from the sky during a heavy rainstorm. As the tale of the fish spread, visitors to Kathmandu would ask, “where did it fall?” and locals would reply “ansaa,” pointing to the spot where the shrine now stands. Today, Asan is a primary market for locals and stands at the nexus of six streets that were an important meeting place along an ancient trade route between India and Tibet. Everything from spices and dried fish, to plastic toys and hardware, can be found in the bazaar. Those selling grains or rice are required to offer a portion of their goods to the temple dedicated to Annapurna Ajima, the goddess of abundance and the patron deity of the neighborhood. The symbol of the fish is one of the more important avatars of the god Vishnu, who once transformed into Matsya (the fish) to save humanity from the great flood. The fish is also one of the Ashtamangala (the Eight Auspicious Signs) found in Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. It’s the focus of numerous religious parables.",The shrine is found in the Asan Tole market.
90,Budhanilkantha,"Budhanilkantha, Nepal",This representation of Lord Vishnu is the largest stone sculpture in Nepal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/budhanilkantha,"Nestled in the Himalayan foothills well north of Kathmandu’s city center is a wholly remarkable Hindu temple. The site pays homage to Vishnu (Narayan) whose likeness floats on the sea of bliss reclining upon the multi-headed snake Shesh. It’s believed the 16-foot (5-meter) long sculpture made from a single block of basalt, was created during the 6th-century CE by Vishnugupta, an early king of the Kathmandu Valley. Dedication to the worship of Vishnu at this temple varied over the centuries and was rediscovered periodically by devotees. Today, it’s an important religious center for thousands of pilgrims who visit every year during Haribondhini Ekadashi. This sacred event is held during the 11th day of the Hindu month of Kartik (October – November). The event marks the end of the four-month period of Chaturmas, during which Vishnu is believed to sleep. As a member of the Hindu triad along with Shiva and Brahma, Vishnu represents goodness and preservation. Some Hindus believe that Buddha was an incarnation of Vishnu, and some Buddhists venerate Vishnu as a protector of Buddhism. Regardless of the connection, the name Budhanilkantha has nothing to do with Buddha. Perhaps more confusingly, Vishnu has over a thousand different names, but Budhanilakantha is not one of them. Sanskrit for “Old Blue Throat,” Budhanilakantha is actually one of the names for Lord Shiva. The origin of the name lies in legends that discuss the struggles between gods and demons that accidentally released a poison from the ocean of existence, requiring intercession by Shiva. To save the world, Shiva drank the poison and then quenched his burning throat with the waters of Lake Gosainkund. The poison left a blue bruise on his throat, hence the name Budhanilkantha. The water surrounding the recumbent Vishnu at the temple is believed to be from Lake Gosainkund, and the faithful believe that a mirror image of Shiva lies on the underside of the sculpture. Despite the complexity of Vaishnavism nomenclature, the temple itself is a visual delight, frequently adorned with colorful flowers and tika powder. It’s also surrounded by classic Nepali and Newari architecture in a paradigmatic Himalayan neighborhood.",
91,Shiva Statue,"Shankharapur, Nepal","The spot where Parvati convinced Shiva to marry her, has become a pilgrimage site for married and unmarried women.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shiva-statue,"Not far from the headwaters of the Manohara River, Shiva sits overlooking a sacred spot marked by the Swasthani Mandir. It was here that Parvati fasted and endured extraordinary hardships in an effort to charm a grieving Shiva to become her husband. As the story goes, Shiva was in mourning after the death of his first wife, Sati. While he was secluded the demon Tarakasura, who could only be killed by a son of Shiva, ran amok. The other gods implored Shiva to leave his retreat, marry Parvati (an incarnation of Sati), and produce a son that could stop the rampaging Tarakasura. Shiva eventually relented, but tested Parvati’s devotion through multiple trials performed along the banks of the Manohara River. Revealing herself to be steadfastly faithful, Shiva married Parvati and their son, Kartikeya, vanquished the demon. The rituals performed by Parvati are associated with Swasthani, the goddess of good fortune, and the nearby temple is named in her honor. Every year between the full moons of January and February, thousands of women gather at the temple to recite the “Swasthani Barta Katha,” a cycle of 31 stories originally narrated by Lord Kumar, a son of Shiva and Parvati. For a full month, married women fast and pray for the well-being of their husbands, while single women emulate Parvati in hopes of gaining a spouse. The festival concludes when the women offer (among other items) 108 holy threads, 108 sel­rotis (ring-shaped sweet rice bread), and 108 fruits to Swasthani. Women without husbands or sons give a portion of the offerings to the river. The number 108 symbolizes Shiva’s 108 attendants. So while the goddess is worshipped for her power, it’s in the context of Shiva’s patriarchy. As a result, the stories of the Swasthani Barta Katha are interpreted differently by different generations. But at this sacred site, tradition endures under the watchful gaze of Lord Shiva.",
92,Kailashnath Mahadev Statue,"Sanga, Nepal",Nepal is home to the world’s tallest Shiva statue.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kailashnath-mahadev,"Completed in 2011 after seven years of construction, this 144-foot tall statue presenting the hand gesture (or mudra) offering blessings of peace stands approximately 12 miles east of Kathmandu. Nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty (151 feet), Shiva is comprised of copper, zinc, concrete, and steel. It’s also the second tallest Hindu deity in the world. Accompanied by his telltale trident representing Shiva’s three functions as creator, preserver, and destroyer, as well as a damaru (drum), which he uses in his dance, Shiva is also garlanded by the serpent Vasuki, who represents power and fearlessness. Next to Shiva is Nandi, the bull that represents one of Shiva’s alter egos Pashupati, or “Lord of Cattle.” Surrounding the statue in the temple complex are 12 Shiva lingams, which may or may not be symbolic phalluses depending on the source, but represent Shiva’s role as a creator and god of fertility. The name Kailashnath means “Master of Mount Kailash,” while Mahadev means “great god.” Mount Kailash, Shiva’s traditional home, is a 21,800-foot tall mountain in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China near the northwest corner of Nepal. It sits near the headwaters of the Indus, Brahmaputra, and Karnali rivers. To help visitors and votaries reach Shiva’s mount, a new 738-foot pedestrian suspension bridge was recently constructed over the busy Araniko Highway. The views of the Himalayas and Kathmandu Valley from the bridge are alone worth the hike up to the statue.","Kailashnath Mahadev can be viewed 24 hours a day, but access to the grounds is limited to 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The statue is also part of a large resort run by the Hilltake company."
93,Bardia National Park,Nepal,This park is the prime habitat for Nepal’s Bengal tigers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bardia-national-park,"A little more than 60 Royal Bengal tigers roam Bardia National Park, around one-fourth the total tiger population in Nepal. Together with the adjacent Banke National Park, Bardia forms part of the 860 square mile Tiger Conservation Unit, where visitors have a sporting chance of seeing the usually elusive great cats in the wild. Because it’s more remote than the better known Chitwan National Park, few people visit the less developed Bardia, allowing flora and fauna to flourish. Tigers and one-horned rhinos are especially abundant here, but more than 50 other mammals call Bardia home. These include the Gangetic river dolphin, swamp deer, and wild elephants. Additionally, the park is a birder’s paradise with more than 400 species having been recorded within the park. Mugger crocodiles, and their pointy-nosed cousins the gharial, also lurk in the Babai River where their critically endangered population is starting to recover. The park began as a royal hunting ground and was later transformed into a larger reserve. It was named a national park in 1988. To create the reserve, over 1,500 households were moved to establish the nearly 250,000-acre park, but despite this, the region is culturally rich. In particular, the indigenous Dangaura Tharu people occupy the surrounding area around Nepal’s Terai region. With such a vibrant natural setting, it’s no surprise that the Tharu are animists whose generations of isolation led to a culture and language distinct from other prominent Nepali groups. The increase in both the tiger and human populations over the past few decades has unfortunately resulted in increased violent interactions near Bardia. In 2020, two Tharu men who ventured from their nearby farms into the dense jungle were killed by a tiger. The Indian side of the border has also experienced tiger attacks near the neighboring Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary. To keep things in perspective, the total tiger population is approximately 3,500 with around 250 in Nepal and 3,250 in India. Nepal’s human population is around 29 million, while India’s is 1.3 billion.",Getting to Bardia typically involves taking a local flight into the town of Nepalgunj and then driving 2-3 hours to the park.
94,Aircrafts Museum,"Dhangadhi, Nepal",Nepal's first aviation museum found a logical home in the most unexpected place.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aircrafts-museum,"Commercial pilot and former member of the Nepalese Army, Bed Upreti, created Nepal’s Aircrafts Museum to bring tourism and awareness to Nepal’s remote far west region, and within its first years of operation, the destination has succeeded in making a mark on all who have made a pilgrimage to the area to visit the charming temple to aviation. Housed inside the fuselage of a 100-seater aircraft from defunct Cosmic Air, visitors approach the museum’s entrance and are greeted by a sign bearing instructions to take off one’s shoes. Upon doing so, the door to the aircraft opens and a man dressed in a flight attendant’s uniform offers a greeting to all. The tour begins winding its way through the interior of the aircraft. During a stop in the plane’s cockpit, guides impart the more technical aspects of how one actually goes about navigating and flying aircraft. Throughout the tour, a profusion of over 200 models of commercial and fighter jets line the plane’s walls, all of which were built by local children. These miniature contributions to the museum exist as part of Bed Upreti’s community outreach initiative intended to bolster the youth’s interest in aviation, all of which is, in turn, fueled by the enthusiasm of the new visitors to the region thanks to the Aircrafts Museum itself.","Pay close attention to the blue and white signs along the main road, as it is easy to get lost along the way."
95,Gurkha Memorial Museum,"Pokhara, Nepal",This institution honors Nepal’s most storied warriors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gurkha-memorial-museum,"Fighting under the code that “it is better to die than be a coward,” the world-famous Gurkha soldiers first came to prominence during the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-1816. This museum first opened in 2005 and celebrates the international achievements of this elite force through two centuries of paintings, photographs, and artifacts. The 1st King George’s Own Gurkha Rifles was the inaugural Gurkha regiment formed by the British in 1815 from defectors of the Anglo-Nepalese War (although they actually served under the authority of the East India  Company). They have served in nearly every British campaign since. The Gurkhas officially became members of the British Indian Army during the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857, and since then have campaigned in Afghanistan, Russia, China, Malaysia, Burma, among many others in addition to serving with distinction in both world wars. The Anglo-Nepalese War also introduced the world to the now-iconic Khukuri knife (commonly called the Gurkha knife), many of which are on display in the museum.  Its unique design with a distinctively curved blade makes it an efficient slashing weapon. It is, however, mostly used as a utility knife, and in addition to being standard British issue, it can be used effectively to cook. Another iconic symbol of the Gurkha troops is the Queen’s Truncheon, a copy of which is prominently exhibited. The six-foot-tall bronze and silver truncheon was a gift from Queen Victoria following meritorious service during the Sepoy Rebellion, and is carried on parade by the Truncheon Jemadar. As additional recognition, Queen Victoria appointed two Gurkha officers to attend the monarch at every official event, a tradition that continues to this day. The museum is appropriately located in Pokhara, where every recruit begins his journey. Each year, more than 6,000 young men try out for the Gurkhas, but only 400 are chosen. The most grueling test is the infamous “Doko race” during which candidates must run 3 miles (5 kilometers) at high altitude up the Himalayan foothills carrying 55 pounds of rocks on their backs in under 45 minutes. Compared to the initiation trials, Gurkhas usually find basic training in the British Army a breeze. The might and courage exhibited by these world-class soldiers once prompted Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw to remark that “if a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or is a Gurkha.”",The museum's hours are 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m.
96,Nepali Folk Musical Instrument Museum,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This secluded museum beats the drum for the preservation of Nepal's musical heritage.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nepali-folk-musical-instrument-museum,"Nepal’s more than 100 distinct ethnic groups have produced over 1,300 different designs of musical instruments, a fact that struck a chord with Ram Prasad Kadel who began collecting Nepali instruments in 1995. Today, he showcases a significant portion of his impressive collection of some 650 instruments in a museum he opened in 2002. Although Kadel is not a musician himself, he is dedicated to telling the story of Nepal’s musical traditions in a sustainable way. A key element to building his collection is that he has not removed playable instruments from the 77 districts he has visited in Nepal, preferring to purchase decommissioned instruments or have local artisans craft new models. To avoid overwhelming his guests with the scale of his collection, Kadel breaks down his tour into nine categories of instruments. One notable example stands at the museum’s entrance, where visitors are met by an astonishingly large saarangi, an iconic traditional stringed Nepali instrument. It’s believed to be the world’s largest saarangi. Many of the instrument’s shapes and sounds are inspired by the natural surroundings of Nepali. Although many of the instruments are preserved behind glass, some are displayed openly and Kadel often showcases their sounds. A serpentine trumpet known as a naagbell is a favorite of school groups. Other instruments are available for professional musicians to play, and Kadel regularly invites performers to give public concerts and make recordings as part of his mission to preserve Nepal’s musical heritage. Fittingly, the museum is housed in the Tripureshwor Mahadev Temple complex, a towering cultural landmark. Located near the banks of the Bagmati River, it was built in 1818 by the impressively talented Queen Tripurasundari in memory of her deceased husband, King Rana Bahadur Shah. With three tiers, the temple is considered the largest in Kathmandu and is brimming with exceptional artistry, craftsmanship, and cultural relics. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Music Museum of Nepal.",The temple complex is currently undergoing renovations from the 2015 earthquake.

97,Maitighar Mandala,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Hiding in plain sight near Kathmandu’s government center is a giant mandala that has become a locus for political protest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maitighar-mandala,"Hiding in plain sight near Kathmandu’s government center is a giant mandala that has become a central location for political protest. Every day, thousands of commuters drive past an outsized tribute to Nepal’s rich Buddhist heritage. Lying in a traffic circle near Singha Durbar, the Nepali government palace, the recessed mandala is difficult to observe from street level while trying to negotiate the heavy traffic. However, it has played a central role in the civic life of the city. Constructed in 2001, the mandala was part of a larger Kathmandu beautification project inaugurated prior to the 11th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit. Measuring approximately 50’ x 50’, the mandala’s design has a series of concentric circles inscribed within a square. It features images of vajras, a ritual weapon symbolizing the power of a thunderbolt, and lotus petals which symbolize purity. The name Maitighar translates to “maternal home,” and derives from a famous movie of the same name that played at a theater that once stood on the same spot. Due to its proximity to many government buildings, Maitighar Mandala has been the site of numerous protests, especially during the civil war and Maoist insurgency. Other important civic events have been held here including in 2017, when KP Sharma Oli, who was later elected prime minister, hosted the Nepal Patriotic Youth Society. At that event, the largest Nepali flag ever made was raised. The flag measured 32 feet (10 meters) tall and weighed more than 17 pounds (8 kilograms). In 2018, the government prohibited gatherings at the mandala ostensibly because such events interfered with traffic. Nevertheless, demonstrations and other events have continued. The term “mandala” is simply the Sanskrit word for “circle,” and they are used both for teaching and healing.  Although they are originally Buddhist in origin, mandalas are also used by Hindus and Jains for meditation. Mandala designs can be deeply intricate and complex, but generally describe the cycles of life and one’s journey through the universe.","The Maitighar Mandala is located in a traffic island at the intersection of Thapathali, New Baneshwor, and Bhadrakali roads at the southeast corner of Singha Durbar."
98,Mulkot Mirror Wall,"Purano Jhangajholi, Nepal",This twisty section of highway in the Himalayan foothills is lined with thousands of small mirrors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mulkot-mirror-wall,"Near the village of Mulkot Bazar, along a winding stretch of the BP Koirala Highway, a retaining wall is covered with thousands of small mirrors.  The mirrors are offered up to the goddess Seti Devi Mata as prayers to avoid accidents. A nearby temple sells additional mirrors to any travelers who wish to add to the panoramic oblation. Also known as the Banepa Sindhuli Bardibas Road, this 98 mile-long highway connects the Kathmandu Valley with the Eastern Terai. Although it is a relatively short highway, the design challenges of carving a road through the landslide and earthquake-prone Himalayan foothills account for the lengthy construction time—19 years in total.  The Japanese government designed and funded the highway’s construction with a grant assistance program. Today, the highway is regarded as one of the best-built roads in Nepal, as well as one of Asia’s most dangerous. It takes four to five hours to drive the highway. The drive offers unparalleled views of Nepal’s landscape (assuming one does not become part of that landscape in the process). Stopping to appreciate the mirrors is tricky since the road has no shoulder. And anyone who does try to make the stop will inevitably be faced with the incessant honking of drivers warning you they’re speeding around the bend. But no matter what, any drive along this road will leave you with the sense that you have traveled through the looking glass.","Given that there's no shoulder along the BP highway, please use extreme caution if you plan to stop at this site."
99,Thapathali Durbar Temple,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This is one of the last surviving structures of a once vast palace complex.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thapathali-durbar-temple,"Central Kathmandu, in an area north of the Bagmati River, once teemed with elaborate palace complexes built by kings and prime ministers. Today, with the exception of the famous and touristy Durbar Square, many of those palaces have been repurposed or destroyed by time and earthquakes. One of the most impressive estates was Thapathali Durbar, home of the Thapas. Construction of the palace began around the turn of the 18th-century under the orders of Nain Singh Thapa, an influential general and grandfather of the powerful prime minister, Jung Bahadur Rana. Thapa barely lived to age 30, dying after being wounded in battle. Later generations expanded the family home to an impressive degree. As the Thapa/Rana family fortunes and power declined, other palaces became the center of Kathmandu society and government. Eventually, a large portion of the palace was converted into a hospital and one of the primary buildings was refitted to serve as the Nepal Rastra Bank. This temple to Shiva, now the centerpiece for a small Newar community, is one of the last original palace structures left. Surrounded by outdoor stoves, rambunctious children, barking dogs, and an abundance of drying laundry, this building hardly proclaims a stately past, but it has withstood the test of time. A few blocks south, on the banks of the Bagmati River is the more notable Kal Mochan Temple, completed by Jung Bahadur Rana just outside the walls of Thapathali Durbar. Although one can still see the impressive dome of Kal Mochan from various points of the city, it is in fact a reconstruction since the original was destroyed in the earthquake of 2015. Somewhat ironically, Kal Mochan was dedicated to Vishnu “The Preserver” while the temple to Shiva “The Destroyer” still stands.","Although Thapathali Durbar can be found on maps, the temple is a bit hard to find. The only public entrance is on the west side of the community along a very narrow road. Locals will be able to help with directions."
100,Langtang Village Memorial,"Helambu, Nepal",This memorial honors a village that was destroyed during a 2015 earthquake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/langtang-memorial,"Saturday, April 25, 2015, was a devastating day for Nepal. At 11:56 a.m., an 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck the Gorkha District, about 60 miles west of Kathmandu. The quake killed some 9,000 people throughout Nepal. Around 243 of those unfortunate souls were visiting or living in the village of Langtang, which was almost completely annihilated by a landslide. Situated in a valley at over 11,000 feet above sea level, Langtang was a popular teahouse community for trekkers exploring the Himalayas near Nepal’s border with Tibet. Views of the looming mountain, Langtang Lirung, and numerous exquisite glacial lakes made the hike through Langtang National Park irresistible. However, the extraordinary natural beauty belies unimaginable danger, as one of those lakes collapsed during the earthquake which caused around 40 million tons of rock to cascade into the valley. Only one structure sheltered by a cave and a handful of older residents survived the disaster, which seems miraculous given the enormity of the debris field. The mile-wide swath of destruction also managed to wipe out the river that flowed through the valley. Sitting atop the rubble now stands a memorial in the style of a Buddhist mani wall. The name derives from the mantra om mani padme hum, which is recited in appeal to Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of compassion. The names of the victims are inscribed on the wall above as colorful Buddhist flags flutter in the wind. Today, the area has started to recover a bit and trekkers have returned to the trail, although they stop at other villages for tea and to rest before tackling the remainder of the hike. But for a few moments, they pause reflectively at the Langtang Village Memorial to consider the awesome power of the ever-changing Himalayas.","Although the Langtang trek is considered one of Nepal's easier trails, it still takes two days of upward hiking to reach the memorial."
101,Stone Cutters' Row,"Lalitpur, Nepal",An ancient art form is kept alive in this corner of Nepal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-cutters-row,"Chiseled into the side streets of Lalitpur, just south of Patan Durbar Square, are dozens of workshops featuring one of Nepal’s oldest crafts. The skills needed to carve the distinctive Nepali black limestone are handed down from generation to generation, and some of the artists in Stone Cutters’ Row can trace their artistic heritage back more than 500 years. Today, the two primary forms of sculpting are traditional and modern, and the sculptures in Stone Cutters’ Row are almost entirely traditionally rendered using little more than hand-held hammers and chisels. The 2,000-year-old stone sculpture of Yaksha Bodhisattva housed in the National Museum in Kathmandu is the first example of this artistic tradition, and it was done using mostly the same techniques on display in Lalitpur. Historically, craftsmen during the Licchavi period (4th-century CE) were noted for their artistry, which even modern masters have not been able to duplicate. Later, during the Malla period, kings were so protective of stone carving skills that they routinely cut off the hands of artisans to prevent neighboring monarchs from luring them away. Local lore recounts the story of one carver so gifted that after having both hands cut off, he continued to carve with his feet. Not surprisingly, artisans were reluctant to take up the trade, and by the late 20th-century, it was estimated that only about five families remained stewards of the craft. A resurgence of interest in stone carving began in the 1990s as Nepal opened to tourists, and although some modern power tools are now used to keep up with demand, 75 percent of the work is still done the old-fashioned way. Today, there are perhaps 20 families engaged in the trade and efforts continue to formally teach stone-craft to younger generations in art schools. As traditional works, sculptures are all made from the same limestone mined from the Chandragiri Hills, and the designs are largely the same from shop to shop. They primarily feature animal effigies (both real and mythical), water spigots, stupas, linga (the curiously phallic symbol of Shiva), and stelae featuring any number of different deities. True masters produce more imaginative and intricate works, sometimes in epic proportions weighing over one ton. So if original Nepali artwork is your quarry, don’t seek out typical bore-ing souvenirs. Be boulder and head to Lalitpur where you will likely find some real gems.","To find Stone Cutters' Row, start at the main entrance to Patan Durbar Square and walk south-east on the main road. After about half a mile, the street will begin to narrow and you will start to see workshops on both sides of the road. Some are hidden in alleys and nooks. The row extends for perhaps less than a mile."
102,Kudan Archaeological Site,"Kapilvastu, Nepal",The site where Sakyamuni Buddha first met his father after achieving enlightenment.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kudan-archaeological-site,"Set back from the main road heading north from India to Kapilvastu, Nepal, is a seemingly unremarkable pile of bricks adorning a nondescript field.  It would be easy to drive past this spot without further investigation, but that would be a regrettable decision since this is a site burgeoning with historical and religious significance. Now known as Kudan after the nearby village, the site is believed to be the Nigrodharam Bihar mentioned in Buddhist texts where Buddha met his father, King Suddhodhana, for the first time following his enlightenment. The site is located nearly six kilometers (3.7 miles) south of Buddha’s childhood home, the palace at Tilaurakot. Kudan served as a meeting place for Buddha’s followers and also hosted the ordination of his son, Rahula, an event commemorated by a stupa erected atop the tallest hill. Consequential theological debates were also held at Kudan, including whether women ought to be ordained.  Although Buddha initially rejected this proposal, his step-mother, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, prevailed upon him and became the first bhikkhuni, or Buddhist nun. The excavation of the Bihar (“home”) began in 2007, revealing original stone and brickwork. The site contains several ancillary structures including a well, several stupas, and the remains of a large pond. The Bihar itself stands 22 feet high and measures over 15,000 square feet in area. A dubious staircase takes intrepid explorers to the top of the Bihar for an unparalleled view of the entire site as well as to the locus of a well-worn Shiva linga. Although many of the specific details about Buddha’s life and the initial spread of his philosophy are shrouded in legend, the site’s original name—Nigrodharam—derives from Nigrodha, the name of a Buddhist monk who purportedly once owned the banyan grove where the Bihar was built. In the third century B.C., Nigrodha is said to have converted Emperor Ashoka Maurya to Buddhism who became one of Buddhism’s most powerful champions. Today, stone pillars erected by Ashoka can still be found in nearby Nepali villages and cities celebrating the Buddha. Kudan is, therefore, a good starting point for any enthusiastic pilgrim to retrace the footsteps of the Buddha and his followers.","To get the best experience in Kudan, it is a good idea to hire a knowledgeable guide as interpretive signage is limited and unreadable in some cases."
103,Ganatantra Smarak,"Kathmandu, Nepal","Adjacent to Narayanhiti Palace, this park commemorates those who fought in Nepal's civil war.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ganatantra-smarak-republic-memorial,"Nepal’s civil war, also known as the Maoist Insurgency, lasted for over ten years before the monarchy was abolished, giving rise to the People’s Republic. Today, a four-and-a-half-acre park near the Narayanhiti Palace Museum commemorates those who fought and witnessed the falling of the world’s last Hindu kingdom. The road to democracy began long before the Civil War. In 1951, power was seized from the oligarchical Rana family and the first democratically elected government was established in 1959. When the Nepali Congress allied itself with the United Left Front in 1990 to push for democratic reforms, communist groups coalesced around alternative reform policies and the nation began a slow march toward armed conflict. Ultimately, China supported the Maoist revolutionaries, while the U.S., U.K., and Belgium supported the opposition, an extension of the Great Game that played out across Central and South Asia for centuries. Much like the new republic, the memorial itself was the result of political battles and years of tumult. After the cornerstone was laid in 2012, government agencies began to squabble over whose stories the memorial would tell, what it would stand for, and who would manage it. Disagreements and countless adjustments to park designs slowed construction—a symptom, and perhaps direct result of, uncertainty over Nepal’s emerging identity. A massive earthquake hit in April of 2015, followed by a blockade of materials from India, further delaying the completion of the park. It finally opened to the public in the spring of 2020. Today, the park features gardens, pools, stone walkways, and a giant elliptical structure on pedestals representing the four cardinal directions and memorializing those who were killed or injured during the revolution. The park lies adjacent to Narayanhiti Palace—a symbolic location, given that the massacre of the Royal Family in 2001 at the palace paved the way for the collapse of the monarchy and the establishment of the republic.",The park is open to the public from 5:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. each day.
104,Indreshwar Mahadev Temple Complex and Museum,"Panauti, Nepal",One of the largest pagodas in Nepal is a 13th century testament to regional craftsmanship.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/indreshwar-mahadev-temple-complex-and-museum,"One of the largest Newari pagoda-style wooden temples in Nepal, the triple-tiered Indreshwar Temple dates back to 1294. It took nearly 90 years to complete, has been renovated several times over the centuries, and has survived numerous earthquakes including the devastating 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Its architectural strength derives—perhaps in part—from its northeastern cornerstone, which is said to be the cursed disembodiment of the divine Ahalya. Although Ahalya’s story varies widely from text to text, she is generally described as being the most beautiful woman in the world, created by the god Brahma himself. In the most common retelling of her fate, she was married to Gautama Maharishi but was tricked and seduced by Indra, the king of heaven. For her infidelity, she was turned to stone. Whatever the source of the temple’s staying power might be, it towers over the confluence of the Rosi and Punyamati rivers and serves as both a village landmark and an important spiritual center to the small settlement of Panauti—by some measures, one of the oldest towns in Nepal. Regardless of age, Panauti’s architecture shows distinct cultural influences from Bhaktapur and is one of the best-preserved centers of Newari craftsmanship, exemplified nowhere more majestically than the Indreshwar Temple. Unfortunately, since the town lies well off the main east-west highway that cuts across Nepal, Panauti is often overlooked except by devoted pilgrims. The Newari people have inhabited the Kathmandu Valley for many centuries. While they are the sixth-largest ethnic group in the country, their cultural contributions—particularly in architecture—continue to be highly emblematic of the broader Nepalese aesthetic. The wood and brickwork at Indreshwar Temple are especially fine examples of Newari craftsmanship, and the small museum next to the temple teems with other intriguing examples of the area’s artistic heritage, from brassware to woodcarvings, statuary, and beyond.",
105,Koshi Barrage,"Bhardaha, Nepal","This structure, built more than 60 years ago to manage devastating seasonal floods, is known to attract a rare species of freshwater dolphin.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koshi-barrage,"Beginning high up in Tibet and snaking its way through Nepal and India, the Koshi River eventually empties into the storied Ganges near the town of Kursela after a journey of 450 miles. Notoriously fickle about its exact path, the river is often called “the Sorrow of Bihar” because of its devastating floods during monsoon season near Bihar, India. This prompted the building of a barrage (aka a weir or sluice) near Nepal’s border with India in the late 1950s. Equipped with 56 gates spaced across a 1,150-meter (3,772-foot) expanse, the barrage has had some success managing the temperamental waterway, although Nepal’s largest river will likely never be completely tamed— in the past 100 years alone it has moved nearly 150 kilometers (93 miles) laterally. The barrage was designed to last for 25 years, but more than 60 years later, a more permanent structure has yet to be built. The fragility of the barrage was revealed in 2008 when the eastern embankment collapsed, causing a major flood that left more than 3 million people homeless. Although the barrage is entirely within Nepal’s borders, India has the sole responsibility to maintain it, and funds are customarily scarce for repairs and upkeep. Nevertheless, the barrage has performed admirably despite being well past its prime and having to withstand pressure from up to 135 million tons of silt each year. The barrage has also become something of a noted social venue for fishermen, tourists, birdwatchers, locals, and endangered Ganges River dolphins, which position themselves in front of the open flood gates to catch funneled fish. These dolphins are essentially blind since the silt-filled water is too opaque for them to rely on sight. They are distinctive in many other ways as well, possessing elongated beaks and flippers, a slightly unsettling misshapen appearance, and occasionally a pinky hue. Spectacularly shy and rare (only approximately 2,000 dolphins are known to exist in the Ganges and Indus River systems), one can stand on the Koshi Barrage and easily spot at least half a dozen at a time feeding and playing. As such, being barraged by dolphins makes a visit worthwhile.","Driving the East-West Highway westward from Itahari, Nepal to the barrage, travelers will cross the Indian border briefly, but no visa is required as there is no checkpoint."
106,Kumari Ghar,"Kathmandu, Nepal",A brick building in Kathmandu's Durbar Square is home to Nepal's most prominent living goddess.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kumari-ghar,"Every day visitors, tourists, and worshipers alike gather in the courtyard below the balcony of the Kumari Ghar, hoping to catch a glimpse of a living goddess. The Kumari (literally “virgin”) is believed to be the reincarnation of the Hindu warrior goddess Taleju, a manifestation of Durga. Buddhists, on the other hand, believe her to be the tantric goddess Vajradevi. Nepal has several Kumaris, but Kumari Devi, or the Royal Kumari, is the most famous. Selected in early childhood from the Newar Buddhist Sakhya caste of goldsmiths and silversmiths, potential candidates are placed in a darkened room with freshly severed buffalo heads and dancing men wearing demon masks. It is believed if one candidate is not frightened, as most young girls surely would be, she is the next reincarnation of Taleju. Once chosen, she moves into the Kumari Ghar, where her feet will never touch the ground and she’ll only leave during specific festivals and religious duties. Each day, however, she makes occasional appearances from her balcony where crowds below wait to see her. As soon as she begins menstruating, or loses blood from an injury, she reverts back to mortal status and re-enters society, as the selection process begins again. The Kumari Ghar was built in 1757 by King Jaya Prakash Malla when he was overcome in guilt after offending the current Royal Kumari. In an act of atonement, he built her a new home. It was renovated in 1966.","The Kumari Ghar is located near the south entrance of Durbar Square in Kathmandu. The best time to see the living goddess is between 9-11 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. No photography or video is allowed of Kumari. There's a small entrance fee to visit Durbar Square, but no additional fee to visit Kumari Ghar."
107,"Ashoka Pillar, Lumbini","Lumbini Sanskritik, Nepal",Designed to honor the birthplace of Buddha.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ashoka-pillar-lumbini,"One of the most prolific bumper sticker and t-shirt slogans in Nepal is “Buddha was born in Nepal.” Although he is often associated with India where he lived and traveled extensively, or with Tibet where his influence is keenly felt, Siddhartha Gautama Buddha is widely believed to have been born in Lumbini, Nepal, where his nascency is majestically celebrated. Standing just outside the renowned Maya Devi Temple in the Lumbini gardens is the Ashoka pillar commemorating this transcendent event. Buddha’s exact year of birth is disputed, but it is acknowledged that the pillar was erected at least 300-400 years after his existence by the emperor Ashoka in the year 249 BCE. Ashoka ruled over most of present-day India as head of the Mauryan Empire, which was founded on and expanded through violent and bloody conquest by Ashoka and his predecessors. But it is said that he converted to Buddhism and a life dedicated to non-violence when a widow of one of the vanquished revealed to him the extent of his brutality. Thus chastened, Ashoka embarked on pilgrimages to seek out and honor sacred Buddhist sites and erected a series of pillars at each place to memorialize his own dedication, as well as the sanctity of Buddha. Some 19 pillars are currently known, and most are in India, but the one in Lumbini holds the greatest significance. The pillar is mentioned in several ancient texts and is believed to have been repaired and re-erected at some point in the 11th or 12th-century. It was re-discovered by Nepali archaeologists in 1896 and has since been refurbished once again. Written in Brahmi script, the pillar’s inscription is said to be the oldest in Nepal and reads: “King Piyadasi (Ashoka), the beloved of Devas, in the 29th year of the coronation, made a visit to Lumbini and paid his homage. Realising the Buddha was born here, a stone railing was built and a stone pillar erected. Because the Lord was born here, the Emperor had the people of Lumbini village freed from some tax and entitled them to the eighth part only.” In addition to the Maya Devi Temple which houses archaeological indicia of Buddha’s birth, the vast Lumbini gardens are populated with numerous temples, monasteries, stupas, and monuments built by countries from around the world in the 20th and 21st-centuries. But the Ashoka Pillar remains the most totemic tribute.","Visitors to Lumbini should plan at least a full-day tour with a guide. For dedicated enthusiasts of Nepali culture and Buddhism, two or more days may be better. Since Lumbini is located in the Terai region of Nepal, the weather can be uncomfortably warm and humid, so be sure to carry water and sunscreen."
108,Janakpur Women's Development Center,"Janakpur, Nepal",This organization has been at the forefront of empowering Nepali women through art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/janakpur-womens-development-center,"Just south of the Kuwa district of Janakpur is an unassuming compound that houses an exceptional group of women with a noteworthy goal. The Women’s Development Center is dedicated to advancing women’s empowerment through the promotion of the 2,800-year-old Mithila artistic tradition. Sometime after the 9th-century in the Videhas Kingdom of Nepal, the distinctive two-dimensional Mithila style of art began to emerge. Originally, the artwork was painted on the mud walls of homes in the Terai region—as it still is in some sections of the Kuwa district—particularly during the Diwali festival. Unlike other traditional painting styles like mandalas and thangkas that primarily use religious symbols and themes, Mithila art incorporates images from daily life, particularly focused on the lives of women. In the 1970s, wall art made its way to the paper and canvas, and in 1989, the Women’s Development Center opened as a first of its kind endeavor to employ women from surrounding villages to produce original artwork. Today, approximately 40 women work at the center to learn various art techniques and business practices, while producing paintings, ceramics, screen-prints, and other handicrafts for the international art market. Although democratic reforms in the past 25 years have sought to improve the lives of Nepali women, many laws designed to promote equal rights go unenforced in a nation that has been deeply patriarchal for centuries. The Women’s Development Center is now one of many organizations throughout Nepal that seeks to help women take control of their lives through better education and economic empowerment.","Although the center publicizes regular hours, it is always a good idea to call ahead to make sure they are open for visitors."
109,Barju Taal,"Chimadi, Nepal",This hand-built lake system has become a haven for birds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/barju-taal,"A few miles west of the bustling Nepali city of Biratnagar and just north of the Indian border is this small lake system that teems with birds and wildlife. Barju Taal, sometimes called Chimdi Taal, is comprised of just over 250 acres of wetlands but hosts more than 500 bird species, and at peak festival times hosts up to 150,000 picnickers. The lake is partially handcrafted and undergoes periodic improvements to accommodate the ever-burgeoning collection of visitors. While birding is a popular activity, there are also miles of trails worth hiking that lead into nearby villages where one can visit with the local Tharu population. No trip to Barju is complete without scoping out the regional farmlands that the lake supports and learning about Tharu culture. Boating is also a popular activity on the lake, although signs warn would-be mariners against “alcoholic paddling.” Swimming likewise is not permitted, but signs are unnecessary given the prevalence of water snakes. The lake has a broader influence beyond recreation and conservation as it is a prominent location mentioned in the Mahabharata, the epic tale about the Kurukshetra War and the world’s longest poem. It was here that the five Pandava princes are said to have stopped for water and engaged in a long philosophical dialogue known as the “Legend of the Virtuous Crane.”","As of November 2021, parts of the lake are undergoing restoration and are dominated more by earthmovers than by birds. Visitors can still enjoy the south end of the lake system."
