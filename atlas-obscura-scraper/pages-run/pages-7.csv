0,Tanah Lot,"Kediri, Indonesia",Isolated atop this Balinese sea crag is a lovely Hindu temple that is said to be guarded by sea snakes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tanah-lot,"Just one of seven ocean temples on the coast of Bali that create a sort of spiritual bulwark against bad vibes rolling on the ocean currents, the ancient shrine atop Tanah Lot is said to be protected from demons by snakes both small and monster-sized. The true origins of Pura Tanah Lot (the temple that sits atop Tanah Lot) are lost to the sea spray of time, but according to legend it was created in the 16th century at the behest of a now-mythologized holy man. Along with the other six sea temples along the Bali shore, each within eyeshot of the next, it is meant to pay respect to the guardian spirits of the sea. The constant pounding of the currents against the base of Tanah Lot have created a number of sea caves at the foot of the rock formation, many of which are home to sea snakes. These snakes are rumored to protect the temple from evil spirits along with a giant nightmare snake that lurks in the waters around the temple. At low tide, Tanah Lot can be approached on foot.  The outer sanctum of the temple is open to visitors (holy men receive and bless you), but the inner sanctum of the temple itself is forbidden to any non-Balinese visitors. The small caves exposed by the receding water can be explored, for those who are not concerned by snakes (real or otherwise).  There is a cave within a cave on the beach where visitors may approach and receive a blessing from the sacred snake. Despite not being able to explore much of the rock’s surface, it cuts a stunning figure against the backdrop of the ocean horizon and the site has accordingly sprouted an unctuous tourist market full of stalls selling cheap merchandise to gullible sightseers. Maybe one day the temple’s guardian snake will rise up and protect the temple’s sanctity from those that would capitalize on its beauty.  Most tourists hire a car and driver for the day to visit Tanah Lot, along with the other popular temples as they are far apart from each other. The road to Tanah Lot temple can be dangerous, hence this is advisable. Alternatively, you can pay for a taxi and ask them to wait for you while you visit the place. If you have the time, the paddy fields along the way to this temple are worth a slow ride to enjoy the view. You may also want to detour to the rugged beach of Pantai Seseh nearby.",hinduism snakes shrines oceans temples rocks geology
1,Ghost Palace Hotel,"Baturiti, Indonesia","An abandoned hotel in the highlands of Bali is shrouded in stories of ghosts, curses, and corruption.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ghost-palace-hotel,"Near the road from hard-partying Kuta to picturesque Lake Beratan, a massive luxury resort stretches languorously down a mountain ridge—not a particularly notable sight, but for the fact that this hotel sits dark and empty. Built in the 1990s and seemingly abandoned on the eve of its opening, the pristine modernity of this derelict building adds significantly to that giddy, something-bad-happened-here feeling that tantalizes ghost hunters and urban explorers alike. The Ghost Palace Hotel—more formally known as the PI Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel and Resort—lies overgrown with creepers, weeds, and legends. One story suggests that the real estate developer behind the project became cursed due to his corrupt business practices and subsequently went bankrupt. Another tells of a fully operational hotel filled with workers and guests, all of whom suddenly disappeared in one night, leaving specters and demons to stalk the hotel’s empty corridors. Other ghostly accounts chalk up the supernatural presence to the spirits of laborers worked to death in the construction of the hotel. Bizarrely, the actual history of the Ghost Palace Hotel is somewhat difficult to verify, but the most likely scenario is that it was built starting in the early 1990s as an investment project of Tommy Suharto, the youngest son of former Indonesian President Suharto. Tommy went to prison in 2002, after being convicted of ordering the assassination of a judge on Indonesia’s Supreme Court who had previously found him guilty of corruption charges. Subsequently, construction of the hotel ground to a halt and has never restarted. Now abandoned for over a decade, the building still bears the furnishings and fixtures of a hotel preparing to receive its first guests. A video from a recent visit to the Ghost Palace Hotel can be seen here. The Ghost Palace Hotel, or PI Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel & Resort, is located on the mountains in the central highlands of Bedugal, 50km north of Kuta. This hotel is not open for public. The main entrance is guarded, but the site can be entered at its highest point, at the back end, by hopping over the fence. According to the previous visitors, entrance through the main gates is watched by 'security officers' and cleaners; at some point they began to take payment of about 10,000 IDR to enter the hotel.",resorts ghosts haunted hotels abandoned
2,Sacred Monkey Forest (Mandala Wisata Wenara Wana),"Ubud, Indonesia",Hindu temple of the dead home to hundreds of long-tailed macaques.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacred-monkey-forest,"In the center of Bali a centuries-old temple complex doubles as an ecological sanctuary for a thriving population of roughly 500 monkeys. The Balinese long-tailed macaques that call the Monkey Forest home are free to come and go as they choose - there are no cages, and no walls to hold them in, so visitors to the Monkey Forest have the unusual opportunity to watch monkeys close up, with no bars between them. Elsewhere in Bali macaques are often seen as pests, liable to steal valuable crops, but in the Monkey Forest they are revered and cared for as part of the spiritual life of the temples, and as manifestations of the Hindu monkey gods. The monkeys are fed and cared for by a staff of locals, who are also there to keep a watchful eye on tourists. The forest itself is comprised of 27 acres of deeply forested land, winding paths, sacred sculptures, and three distinct temples. Over 80 different species of trees have been identified within the forest, which also offer sanctuary to a host of birds, lizards, squirrel and deer, in addition to the star monkeys. The Monkey Forest is also home to a Pura Dalem, or Bali temple of the dead. It acts as counterpoint to the Pura Puseh (temples of origin) and Pura Desa (village temple) and contains a cemetery and Pura Prajapati (cremation temple) dedicated to Dewa Siwa, who judges the karma of the dead. Headstones are easily visible in a clearing visible between the trees near the cremation temple, where the recently dead are buried while their families and loved ones save up for the lavish cremation festivities unique to Balinese culture. At the appointed time families will disinter the dead and relocate them to an elaborate cremation pyre, after which the ashes are distributed to family shrines. It is thought that the earliest temple structures date back to around the mid 13th century, but they have been revised and rebuilt so many times over the years, up to an including the present day, that the edges of ancient and recent are thoroughly blended. The most sacred space in the Monkey Forest is the Lingga Yoni, a Hindu representation of phallus and womb, that has occupied the inner sanctum of the temple for hundreds of years. The third sacred space is a bathing temple, located along the stream that runs through the forest. In recent years researchers from around the world have taken advantage of the opportunity to observe the monkeys in several studies. Local vendors selling bananas and other treats to feed to the monkeys are usually positioned near the entrances, but visitors should bear in mind that the monkeys are wild animals that may bite and also may possibly carry disease. The official position of the Monkey Forest seems to be that no one will stop you from feeding the monkeys, but if you get bit it’s your own damned fault. Their website gently suggests that you might prefer to watch the staff feed the monkeys instead.  Entry: 40000 IDR (about $3) for adults, 30000 IDR (about $2.25) for students. Opening Hours: Monday-Sunday from 8 AM to 6 PM. Parking is free.",monkeys temples sacred spaces animals
3,Pura Lempuyang Luhur,"Abang, Indonesia","Bali's remote ""gateway to heaven"" is one of the most sacred places on the island.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pura-lempuyang,"Pura Lempuyang Luhur is a complex of temples that speckles a trail leading to the top of Mount Lempuyang, a holy mountain. A total of seven temples dot the mountain’s slopes. At the lowest temple, a fantastic “gateway to heaven” greets visitors. Looking through the gate on a clear day reveals Mount Agung framed within its sides. Beyond the gate, three beautiful nāga-lined staircases lead up to the lowest temple. Pura Lempuyang Luhur is one of the oldest and holiest sites on the island and is thought to predate most Hindu temples there. The whole complex has been dubbed one of the “six sanctuaries of the world,” considered the most sacred places of worship on Bali. Yet, because of its remote location tucked away on the island’s eastern end, the complex saw few foreign visitors until recent years. Adventurous (and reasonably fit) travelers may hike up to the top temple, which is a four hour round-trip in total. Along the way, visitors will pass six other temples and can see beautiful vistas before finally arriving at Pura Lempuyang Luhur. Locals believe one must never complain on the way up. If one complains, they will not make it to the top. Pura Lempuyang Luhur, the highest temple, is the crown jewel of the complex (and also its namesake). It sits atop the mountain’s peak, which is believed to be its most sacred spot. Those who make it to the top are rewarded with a peaceful sanctuary and breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains.  Pura Lempuyang is not easily accessible, and parking is limited. The best way to get there is to hire a car and driver. If coming from Ubud or the beach towns on the south coast, budget one full day for this excursion, and consider pairing it with a visit to the nearby Tirta Gangga water gardens. Be respectful at all times. Wear a sarong while visiting this temple complex, and make sure bare knees and shoulders are not visible. This applies to both men and women. If observing a ceremony, take photographs from a respectful distance using your zoom lens. There's no fee to get into the temple, but donations are requested.",hinduism trails temples mountains religion sacred spaces
4,Gereja Ayam,"Magelang, Indonesia",This massive chapel in the middle of the Indonesian forest is both haunting and fowl.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gereja-ayam,"Should you be trekking through the thick forests of Magelang, Indonesia, try not to be too alarmed if you stumble upon a titanic building shaped like a chicken. Known as Gereja Ayam (unsurprisingly, “Chicken Church”), this moldering, behemoth, bird-like building is an unexpected, whimsical sight to stumble upon. While the locals have dubbed it the Chicken Church (and it’s easy to see why), the name is a bit of a misnomer since the visionary behind the crumbling chapel meant it to look like a dove. The man behind the weird structure was Daniel Alamsjah, who received a holy vision that inspired him to create the dove church. He picked a forested hill near Magelang to build his pious tribute, and created possibly the most bird-like building in the world, complete with giant, squawking head, and ornate decorative tail feathers. The prayer house opened its doors (or spread its wings, so to speak) by the 1990s. The fledgling church welcomed any religions that wanted to make the trek, including Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians, holding services in the upper floors, while the lower floors provided rehab and juvenile outreach, among other charitable services. Unfortunately, the project was grounded in 2000 when further construction costs became too high. The poor chicken-dove-church was vacated, and left to the forest. Gereja Ayam continued to rot over the years, becoming a bit more ghoulish (in an avian way), with each year. But these days, it’s been cleaned up and turned into a proper tourist attraction. Local artists have covered the inner walls with vibrant murals showing local mythology and history and there’s a small cafe nestled within the chicken’s rear that sells traditional, tasty treats. You can even climb up to the top of the bird’s head for amazing 360-degree views. The Chicken Church has gained some media attention. In 2016 the documentary film, Into the Inferno, has a section devoted to the temple highlighting the connection to the nearby volcano. Church is open every day and is often part of the nearby Borobodur Temple tour; there is a small entry fee.",churches abandoned sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture
5,Taman Festival,"Denpasar Timur, Indonesia",A haunting theme park is slowly being swallowed by the jungle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taman-festival-bali,"Eerie and overrun with lush greenery, this abandoned theme park in Bali is an urban explorer’s dream. Colorful graffiti adorns the walls of its crumbling buildings. Most of the park has succumbed to nature’s mercy and is slowly being swallowed by the jungle. It isn’t known for certain as to why this grand theme park was deserted by the owners before it ever even opened. Some reports say the owners abandoned ship after fearing it would become unprofitable following the 2002 Bali terrorist attacks. Others say lightning struck its laser machines, which were meant to illuminate the night sky as part of the park’s star attraction. Never fated to fill its grounds with throngs of tourists, it has now become a home for graffiti artists and budding photographers. Wander among the pathways that meander through the eight-hectare site (beware of the broken glass), and you’ll find an olympic-sized swimming pool, a cinema, a wedding chapel, and many restaurants, all reclaimed by nature. It’s a haunting experience. Vines and weeds twist sinisterly around the decrepit structures, while miniature jungles overtake others. Bats, enormous spiders, and a host of other insects hide in the dark corners of the dust-coated buildings. Keep an eye out for the empty crocodile pit—its former residents were left to roam the park after it was abandoned and supposedly lurk just out of sight. Rumors abound that these reptilian residents have been know to snack on humans.  If arriving by bike, you need to pay 2500IDR to the landowner for parking. Locals may charge you something between 10000 and 20000 IDR per person to let you in.",abandoned amusement parks abandoned
6,Komodo National Park,"East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia",A sprawling nature preserve harbors the world's only living dragons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/komodo-national-park,"Historically, dragons have been feared and hunted, but the Komodo National Park was created to protect the only known “dragon” in the world. The Komodo dragon is the largest lizard in the world and can grow up to 2-3 meters in length which would be scary enough if it weren’t for the monster’s poison bite. Despite the beast’s hideous visage and carnivorous reputation this Indonesian wildlife reserve was created to make sure that it does not go extinct. Komodo Island is the only place in the world where the huge lizards live and their relatively small population puts them at extreme risk.  Covering a number of small islands including the largest islands of Komodo, Padar, and Rinca, the national park keeps the delicate natural balance from disappearing. A number of other protected lizards, rats, and snakes also inhabit the islands along with a collection of large mammals that were introduced by man such as buffalo, deer, and monkeys. Unlike many wildlife parks, Komodo covers four human settlements as well, all of which existed when the park was designated. The people living in the park are mainly fishermen and tradesmen. Visitors are welcome to the islands. In order to keep tourists safe from the huge lizards, locals feed the Komodo dragons in the morning so that they are less inclined to look for visiting prey. The protection offered by the reserve has expanded over the years and now includes a marine biome which is preserved along with the other exotic flora and fauna in the Komodo National Park. Despite the increasingly diverse environments in the park, it is unlikely to be known for anything more than the dragons that stalk its shores.  You can arrange for group tours to the various islands of Komodo or even hire your own personal ride to visit Flores Islands. The Komodo National Park is open daily from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and there is even an adventure trek in Komodo Island that takes around 4-5h (4.9 miles). Visitors are advised to bring sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, hike shoes and plenty of water.",reptiles wildlife sanctuaries unesco national parks
7,Goa Gajah,"Sukawati, Indonesia","The name of this ancient Indonesian temple translates as ""Elephant Cave"" but it could be more accurately called ""The Hellmouth.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goa-gajah,"Not far outside of the city of Ubud in Bali is a fantastical archeological site known as Goa Gajah, or “Elephant Cave,” although visitors could be forgiven for finding this name confusing given the wild-eyed demon maw that serves as a front door. The ill-fitting monicker comes from a complicated trickle down of translations relating to the temple cave throughout history that may have alluded to elephants at one point. However there does not seem to be any actual pachyderm imagery anywhere on the site. Instead the facade of the cave is carved into a surprisingly menacing devil’s face with wide eyes staring over the doorway that acts as its screaming mouth. All around the monster’s face is what seems to be a roiling sea of flames. Flanking the frightening frieze are smaller sculptures of creatures that have eroded with time. Despite this terrifying entrance the cave is actually thought to have been a place of meditation and spiritual cleansing where religious offerings were left (and still are). While no one is positive of the original use of the space, it is speculated that the demon’s face on the outside was actually meant to scare away evil spirits, not attract them. A large communal bath was unearthed nearby in the 1950’s featuring tall statues of serene figures pouring water out of jars into the central bath. A far cry from the howling cave entrance. Today the ornately unsettling cave can be visited and all those daring to pass through the demon’s jaws can witness the cave’s secluded quietude.

8,Trunyan,"Trunyan, Indonesia",One native village in Bali lays their dead at the foot of a holy tree whose natural fragrance seems to hide the stench as the bodies decompose.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trunyan,"The walk up to the Trunyan cemetery in Bali is littered with skulls and human bones which have been set up on stones. This is a byproduct of the nearby villagers’ unique death ritual that sees the deceased placed above ground at the foot of a tree to simply decompose in the open air. One might think that such a laissez-faire practice would lead to not only an unstoppable vermin and carrion bird infestation, but also an unlivable stench. However, when the bodies are laid out, they are placed at the foot of a large banyan tree which the villagers consider holy, and which seemingly masks the scent of the corpses. This sacred funeral rite is performed when one of the village’s number dies of natural causes, at which time a white sheet is placed over the body and they are laid out. Others are laid out above ground and covered with bamboo teepees. The villagers who adhere to this practice belong to a group known as the Bali Aga, people who have descended from the original Balinese natives. Their unique “burial” traditions are believed to go back hundreds of years, yet there does not seem to be a case of the exposed corpses presenting a health or comfort issue. In fact, a number of tourists visit the site each year, to the point where it is now common to be approached repeatedly by villagers asking for donations, and even getting there requires exorbitant bribes for boat transportation. However, one thing nearly no one is complaining about is the smell.  Trunyan cemetery is most easily accessible by boat from Kedisan. The price of the boat ride (including the donation for the village) was 400, 000 IDR per person in May 2017. For comparison to rent a car for 10 hours with driver was 550, 000 IDR.",bones cemeteries
9,Padar Island,"Komodo, Indonesia","Once home to Komodo dragons, this island dreamscape has a rare combination of white, pink, and black sand beaches.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/padar-island,"The Indonesian island of Padar is about 20 miles (30 km) from Labuan Bajo, a fishing town on the westernmost part of Flores. Padar is small, but is the third largest island of Komodo National Park, and was once a stomping ground for the immense dragons that gave the reserve its name. Padar is mostly savannah-covered, surreal landscape fringed by bright green-capped mountains of fairy-tale shapes. It’s all surrounded by three turquoise bays, and curiously, each one of the bays’ beaches has different coloured sand: One is pearly white, another charcoal black, and a third is a very rare baby pink. It is a rare combination, a quirk of this unique island. The black-sanded beach has volcanic origin, composed of various dark minerals. The pink, one of a few in the world, has pulverized red coral mixed with white sand.  And the white one, in most any other setting would be a spectacular find. Here, it almost plays third fiddle. Padar is home to a remarkable array of wildlife, especially for its size. There are six species of shark, and two of manta rays, and many different reptiles. There once were three kinds of Komodo dragons here. (They are gone now, but still found on Komodo, Rinca, Gili Montang, Gili Dasami, and Flores.) There are dolphins, the occasional whale, falcons, kites, geckos, and green turtles. And then there are some plain old little mammals, to feed their neighbor predators. Visitors can do a 30 minute hike to Padar's summit to see a panoramic view of the island, go trekking for around an hour, snorkel or just hit the pristine tri-colored beaches. Labuan Bajo is the closest city, and there are tours departing daily for one, two, or three-day visits. The best time is from April to June, and from September to November. Bring sunscreen, sunglasses, good hiking shoes, a hat, plenty of water and get ready for some serious 30-foot exercise uphill.",color landscapes beaches geological oddities islands geology animals
10,Pura Ulun Danu Bratan,"Baturiti, Indonesia",This tiny lake temple dedicated to a water goddess seems to float on the surface.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pura-ulun-danu-bratan,"Bali’s Pura Ulun Danu Bratan temple pokes up out of the waters of Lake Bratan as though it is simply the peak of some much larger temple just beneath the water. While it is as starkly humble as it seems, its importance to the community would seem to back up that grander fantasy. Constructed in 1633, the temple is devoted to the goddess of the lake, Ida Batara Dewi Ulun Danu, in Balinese. The pair of relatively small pagodas that sit on the lake’s waters act as the mother shrines to a countless series of smaller shrines set up at various points downstream. The lake itself has been the main reservoir for a large portion of central Bali for ages and is thus not only functionally very important but also holy to many. In order to keep the waters clean and flowing, the temples on the lake are devoted to the goddess Dewi Danu whose demesne includes rivers, lakes, and other waters. There are also fertility idols at the site of the temples due to the area’s legendary potency and virility, which is also attributed to the waters of the lake. Visitors to the Pura Ulun Danu Bratan site will first pass through an ornate temple structure on land before being able to board a canoe directly to the pagodas, which seem to almost float right on the water. The little buildings actually sit on a pair of small lake islands; however, the visual effect is nonetheless impressive. The site is popular among those looking to take in Bali’s most beautiful temples, but the meditative quietude of the lake backdrop is likely enough to make up for the presence of any strangers.  One of the easy and convenient ways to get there yourself is to take one of the public transports to Lake Bratan from Denpasar or Lovina. Alternatively, you may take the shuttle buses running between the southern beaches and Lovina. From Lovina, it takes 45 minutes to get to the Pura Ulun Danu, while from Ubud, it is a 1.5 hours drive and from Kuta, a 2 hours drive. In case you decide to drive, there is also a spacious park and two restaurants.",lakes temples water
11,Kelimutu Volcano,"Kelimutu, Indonesia",Three wildly colorful calderas top this otherworldly volcano chain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kelimutu-volcano,"Lakes, volcanoes, and colors are all on impressive display at the Kelimutu Volcano, an otherworldly series of geologic cauldrons that hold lakes of startling brilliance. 50 miles from the town of Moni on the Indonesian Island of Flores is Kelimutu Volcano and its three summit craters containing their three lakes. The westernmost of the lakes, Tiwu Ata Mbupu (Lake of Old People), is blue, while Tiwu Nuwa Muri Koo Fai (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) is green, and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanged Lake) is red, the latter two separated only by a crater wall. Historically, the lakes have been the source of minor phreatic eruptions from the 1639 meter high Kelimutu volcano. In addition to being three different colors, the lakes’ color varies on a periodic basis, likely due to chemical reactions from the minerals in the lake triggered by volcanic gas activity, but no thorough studies have as yet been performed. That the three lakes are of the same volcano and are at the same crest, yet have different colors, is incredibly rare and of extreme interest to geologists. The Kelimutu Volcano is one of nature’s most stunning displays of color and chemistry and has attracted a number of photographers and tourists over the years. So long as it never erupts, this candy-colored mountain is just a gentle giant.

12,Luhur Uluwatu Temple,"Kuta Selatan, Indonesia",This Balinese sea temple is thought to be guarded by the hundreds of monkeys that live around it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/luhur-uluwatu-temple,"One of the sacred sea temples that are said to create a visually unbroken chain along the Bali coast, the Luhur Uluwatu Temple is a gorgeous, historic pagoda site that is said to be protected by the mischievous monkeys that live in the surrounding forest. A temple structure of some kind is said to have existed on the cliff where Luhur Uluwatu now resides, long before the current structure was developed. The structures, including a lovely cliffside pagoda and crumbling stone arches, are thought to have been built around the 11th century. The structure is built right up to the edge of a sea cliff that drops 230 feet down into the ocean. Walls along the cliffside prevent visitors stunned by the incredible view of the sunset from plummeting off the edge. Like Tanah Lot (which can be seen from the top of the cliff), another Balinese sea temple that is said to protect Bali from malevolent sea spirits, Luhur Uluwatu has protective animals. As the isolated Tanah Lot is overrun with sea snakes, Luhur Uluwatu is rotten with monkeys. Taking roost in the temple itself and the surrounding vegetation, the monkeys of Uluwatu are known to nab any loose possessions that visitors might have on display, often only trading them back for pieces of fruit. They have been known to rip shiny earrings out of visitors’ ears and run away with them, or steal food right out of visitors’ hands. These beasts are said to be the spiritual protectors of the temple, although their main weapon seems to be annoyance. Spirit monkeys or no, the Luhur Uluwatu Temple is a majestic link in a chain of beautiful sea temples. Just be sure to hold on to your belongings.  A taxi from Kuta to Uluwatu will take 30-40 minutes and cost about 150,000Rp one way. From Nusa Dua, it is a 45 minute drive. It is advisable to hire a car to visit this temple, since you may also visit other places in Bali along with it.",monkeys cliffs temples
13,Jembatan Akar,"West Sumatra, Indonesia",This Sumatran root bridge took almost 30 years to knit itself together.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jembatan-akar,"Extending over the Indonesian Batang Bayang River, the slowly growing Jembatan Akar root bridge is made entirely out of the naturally growing roots of two banyan trees that have been slowly cultivated to knit into a walkable span. The span (Jembatan Akar means “root bridge”) was first conceived of in 1890 by a local teacher who wanted his students from a village across the river to have an easier time getting to his classes. To start the bridge, he put a bamboo frame in place and began wrapping the ever-growing aerial roots of the large banyan trees on either side of the water along the frame. Ever so slowly, the bridge began to take shape. The project took 26 years of carefully tended growth to become sturdy enough to support anyone. The 100-foot span has since been shored up and reinforced with wooden planks and metal cables as well as becoming stronger year after year as the massive roots of the still-living trees continue to grow. Guide lines have also been added to provide additional support for visitors. Unfortunately the original creator of the bridge is no longer alive to see what has grown from his simple idea, but thousands of visitors and commuters each year have him to thank for creating one of the most curious bridges in the world. The bridge is up in the mountains, south east of Padang. Drive south from Padang until Ps. Baharoe and head north towards Kotobarapak.

The Millennium Bridge extends 75 feet (23 meters) from one side of the Ayung River to the other. It is connected to the Green School, an ecologically sustainable complex that’s also made out of bamboo, as well as mud and local grasses. Nearby, there is a community of bamboo houses. These projects, created by the team at IBUKU, an organization dedicated to beautiful and natural building, demonstrate how bamboo can be used as a renewable alternative to concrete or steel, to which it has comparable strength, though is more susceptible to the elements. The bridge, which has a floor area of 230 square feet (70 square meters), took eight months to construct, and was completed in December of 2011. The roof of the covered bridge is inspired by the architecture of the Minangkabau people of Indonesia. In addition to being a means of crossing the Ayung River, the Millennium Bridge can also be rented as a scenic place for events. Up to 30 people can be accommodated on the bridge.",indonesia schools bridges design architectural oddities architecture

What was formerly an impoverished village called Kampung Jodipan was transformed into an oasis of color and art, a project that has delighted visitors and revitalized the local community. The village of Kampung Warna-Warni (Indonesian for “Village of Color”) was once drab and polluted, lacking the economic resources required to build a healthy community. But eight event management students from a nearby university lent a helping hand by applying their class skills to the real world. The students partnered with a local paint company looking to do a social responsibility project, which donated over 6,000 pounds of colorful paint, and voila, a hueless city got a brilliant new paint job. Inspired by the favelas of Rio, every square inch of the rainbow village is coated in color, ranging from pastels of green and orange to pink and yellow. The bridge nearby the village is also painted, its beams erupting in magnificent blues and purples. Although it may seem like the paint job would benefit visitors more than those actually living in the village, the makeover has revitalized the community. The beautiful colors improved the village’s standard of living by drawing in new tourist dollars, and the beauty of the colorful houses has inspired many community members to improve the sanitation of their river. Kampung Jodipan’s experiment was so successful with selfie takers, it inspired several other projects throughout Indonesia, including next door neighbor Kampung Tridi (famous for 3D murals) and Kampung Pelangi (Rainbow Village) in Randusari.  Kampung Jodipan is connected to Kampung Tridi by a colorful bridge. Admission fees for each village are separate.",color villages paintings art

Many of the figures from the parade are displayed throughout the rest of the year here in the Ogoh-Ogoh museum. The work that goes into building the mythological monsters, which can get up to 20 feet tall, is remarkable.

17,Tirta Gangga Water Palace,"Abang, Indonesia",Sacred waters rescued from the wrath of a volcano.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tirta-gangga-water-palace,"Walking amongst the manicured lawns, pools and beastly statuary of the Tirta Gangga water temple in Bali, it is hard to imagine the ruined state they were in not that long ago. Construction on the gardens began in 1948, led by the last Raja of Karangasem (under the Dutch colonial rule). Built as a labor of love, the raja could often be seen getting his hands dirty with the local workers, creating a carefully arranged garden out of the rough hillside surrounding a holy natural spring.Everything came to a dramatic halt in February 1963, when Mount Agung erupted explosively. Although spared from the lava flow, earthquakes and smothering ash devastated the gardens, killing the plants and trees. In the wake of the eruption the property was abandoned, and by the time the staff returned the gardens had been looted, the plants dead and covered in ash. For the next decade and a half, the gardens declined into further ruin.An ambitious restoration process began in 1979, and was extended by the raja’s grandson until the gardens were returned to their former glory.  Located approximately fives miles north of Amlapura.",water temples volcanoes water geology

Upon arrival, you may be surprised to see an abandoned Boeing 737 sitting in an empty lot next door. No one seems to know for sure how a Boeing 737 ended up in Kedonganan in Kuta, Southern Bali. It’s in a built-up area known for seafood restaurants, located a mile or so south of Ngurah Rai International Airport (and clearly visible on Google Maps). The 737 has apparently sat there since 2007. Most locals claim that the owner bought the Boeing to turn it into a tourist-friendly restaurant, but ran out of money and later abandoned it in an otherwise empty lot. Others say it was meant to be turned into a home. Either way, there it sits, held up on stilts, its tail clearly visible from the street. Its engines are missing and the turbines not boarded up, its right wing stretching out above a wide alleyway and almost touching the Dunkin’ Donuts next door. Strange, yes. Unique? Well, not quite. There’s actually another abandoned Boeing 737 about five miles to the south, located in an old quarry just off the Raya Nusa Dua Selatan Highway. They don’t seem to have any connection to each other, beyond the fact that both have become strange tourist attractions in their own right. Maybe it’s a Bali thing…",jungle aircraft abandoned

Located in the Tejakula, Buleleng region, north Bali, American artist Symon has turned his home into a phantasmagoria of art and imagery. Every wall, ceiling and surface from the inside to the outside has been painted a loud color, not that its easy to tell what with the countless framed pictures crammed onto almost every available inch of space. The outside of Symon’s home is arguably even more impressive, with a huge blue religious figure lounging outside his front door, and a large red phallus statue on display. As the gallery is also his home, Symon can sometimes be found on the site and is generally more than happy to discuss the process and history of his prolific work. He is also in the business of selling his art, so if you stop by, bring some cash as there is usually a hard sell at the end.",outsider architecture outsider art art
20,Prehistoric Cave Art of Maros Pangkep,"Bantimurung, Indonesia","These 40,000-year-old stenciled hands are older than the famous cave art in France and Spain.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prehistoric-cave-art-of-maros-pangkep,"A torch beam finds a stencil of a hand, its ochre outline surprisingly vibrant given its age. Next to it, a sketch of a babirusa—a type of wild “pig-deer” found in Indonesia—shows such attention to detail that the gender of the animal (female) is still clear nearly 36,000 years after its creation. It’s thought to be the oldest known example of figurative art in the world. The Pleistocene-era rock art is spread throughout the karst caves within the Maros and Pangkep regions in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Researchers from Australia’s Griffith University used uranium series dating and found that one of the handprints was roughly 40,000 years old. The collection of paintings, which includes the handprint and the babirusa, contains artwork that is slightly older than the images found in European caves. The rock art’s ancient age shattered the preexisting notion among many Western archaeologists and historians that the cave art originated in modern-day Europe. While little-known, these Indonesian cave drawings are even older than the famous stenciled caves in France and Spain. But though it wasn’t celebrated until recently, the cave art wasn’t unknown. H.R Van Heekeren, a Dutch archaeologist, documented the figures and published his work in 1950. However, the paintings were deemed to be of no real significance and subsequently no additional exploration was done until nearly 60 years later. The purpose behind the rock art is unclear. It’s commonly thought that sites with rock art are ceremonial, but there’s no actual evidence to say whether this is truly the case. One theory is that the rock art was an early library cataloging the animals and fish eaten by the people who dwelled here. Another theory is that the stenciled hands may have more symbolic meanings, such as protecting a house, expressing a person’s connection to the place, or attempting to communicate with the spiritual realm. Getting to the karsts requires boating down the narrow river before an hour long walk through rice paddies. A monkey or two may shriek from the tops of the strange palm trees—described by the guide as “shrimpfingers”—before disappearing. Nearby, cows laze and graze under the monolith overhangs and ducks forage for huge snails in the rice paddies. The GPS coordinates lead the Leang Petta Kere cave, which is located within the region and contains prehistoric cave art. Visitors must arrange their visit by contacting the University of Hasnuddin or another Indonesian University. Take bottles of water and wear suitable clothing and shoes.

21,Borobudur,"Magelang, Indonesia",Hundreds of Buddhas in a re-discovered Indonesian temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/borobudur-or-baradubur,"Built in the late 8th century, Borobudur temple took an army of workers and 60,000 cubic meters of lava rock to construct. Yet despite its massive size and elaborate rows of Buddha statues, it was mysteriously abandoned during the 14th century and sat in the jungle, undiscovered until 1814. In the style of a step-pyramid, the temple has six square bases, topped with three circular layers and a large main stupa. Pilgrims and visitors alike follow a guided path to the top of the complex, which leads them around the monument a number of times before reaching the peak. Along the way, the path is marked by 500 Buddha statues and thousands of reliefs that depict daily life in Buddhist Java. At one point in time, Borobudur was the center of Buddhist life in Indonesia, but the adoption of Islam led to a complete abandonment in the 14th century. During the period of British administration in Java, the monument was rediscovered by a Governor-General, and he led the charge over the next 30 years to fully excavate the site and reveal the mysterious lost temple. Since that time, restoration has become a priority and Borobudur is now protected as a UNESCO site. Despite efforts to protect the temple, a few stupas were nearly destroyed during a terrorist attack in 1985. As the site is quite near to a few active volcanos, the temple has also received its share of volcanic dust and earthquake events. The effort for conservation has always been made after similar events happened.  Most people visit Borobudur temple from Yogyakarta as a side or day trip. But it is also well recommended to stay the night at the city itself. From Yogyakarta to Borobudur, there is a public bus connecting the cities. If you are doing a day trip, it is advisable to hire a car along with a driver to get there and back. Alternatively, if you are coming from the west side, catch the public bus from Wonosobo heading towards Yogyakarta and drop off at Borobudur. If you are coming from Jakarta, the easiest way is to first take the direct train to Yogyakarta, and then do a side trip to Borobudur after. The temple is open to public from 6:00 AM to 5:00 PM but only those who get a special pass from the Manohara Hotel can get in before 6:00 AM. Note that you don't need to be a guest of this hotel to get the special pass though.",buddha giant buddhas temples monuments
22,Kawah Ijen,"Banyuputih, Indonesia",Think you have a tough job? Try carrying 200 kilos through a cloud of sulfur down the side of a volcano.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kawah-ijen,"It is an American pastime to complain about one’s job. A bad boss, late hours, poor pay; there is always plenty to complain about. However even the worst office 9-5 in the U.S. is a cakewalk compared to being a sulfur miner on Kawah Ijen, an 8,660-foot active volcano in East Java, Indonesia, which bears a certain similarity to Dante’s vision of hell. Working on the side of the active volcano in temperatures surpassing 100 degrees Fahrenheit, workers use metal poles to hack out chunks of elemental sulfur. Using ceramic pipes, they channel the gases which drain out as liquid red sulfur which then hardens into the yellow chunks the miners carry out. To do all this, the workers must stand near a live sulfur vent pouring out masses of the noxious, choking gas (the air carries H2SO4 and CaSO4, which are both toxic). The workers then load baskets with 150-200 pounds (68-91 kilos) of sulfur chunks and haul them up 200 meters to the crater rim, and then down three kilometers of traile and 1500 meters of elevation to the weighing station where the sulfur is sold to be used in vulcanizing rubber and bleaching sugar. The reward: around US$13 a day. One of the problems with improving the men’s situation is that they are all essentially freelance, with no direct employer, so the only safety standards are those the men impose on themselves, which are very few. The men generally work without (expensive) gas masks, despite the fact that prolonged exposure to the noxious fumes can cause respiratory problems similar to severe asthma. And that’s not to mention the sheer backbreaking nature of the work. One reason the men work in the mine, despite having a life expectancy of about 30, is that it pays marginally better than being a farmer. There is a nearby crater lake, which from afar looks like it might be nice for a cool dip after a hard day of mining, but one would be seriously mistaken. The lake is a 90-degree pool of sulfuric acid in which nothing lives, and which would kill any that dared to swim in it. Birds have been reported to drop dead from the lake’s fumes and to fall into it if they fly overhead. There is no respite to be taken in the harsh volcanic world of Kawah Ijen. Paradoxically, the unusually high sulfur concentrations that feed Kawah Ijen’s mining industry also result in brilliant blue flames that erupt from the volcano and flow lava-like down the mountain. The spectacular display, visible most nights, occurs when the volcano’s sulfuric gases reach the surface and ignite. Burning liquid sulfur creates the appearance of blue lava streaming down the mountainside. From a distance, Kawah Ijen appears not as an unforgiving workplace but as one more of nature’s odd and beautiful phenomena. The nearest airport is the Banyuwangi airport with limited flights from Jakarta or Surabaya. From the airport, it's a 2-hour drive. For visitors from Bali, fast boat operates from Jimbaran Bali to Boom Beach in Banyuwangi taking approximately 2-hours. From Banyuwangi, you can choose from all kinds of vehicles such as 4WD or motorbike or car to get to the starting point of the hike up to Ijen Crater.Alternatively, you can go via Bondowoso from either the northern or southern coast. This is the closer but steeper way and would require a 4WD to access. After that, you will walk for another 8km to Pos Paltuding, the starting point of the hike to Ijen Crater. The cost and difficulty of this route make it the less popular way.",fiery wonders martian landscapes disaster areas volcanoes geological oddities ecosystems geology

This limestone cave has yielded some of the most important finds in modern anthropology. The remains of two “hobbit” people, as the media calls them, were found here in 2003. Homo floresiensis, a homo (or human) genus was discovered here by Mike Norwood, professor of anthropology at the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. Norwood and others have shown that this human existed as recently as 12,000 years ago, possibly putting this species in contact with local homo sapiens. What makes H. floresiensis so remarkable is that they accomplished the same things as their larger H. sapiens cousins, such as making fire and hunting in cooperation with each other, while being less than four feet tall and having brains approximately one-half to one-third of the size of H. sapiens. At this point, this cave is the only site where the “hobbits” of Flores, Indonesia, have been found.  The cave is located north of Ruteng on the island of Flores in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia.

Believed to have been created sometime around 1007 by an Indonesian saint, the ancient temple structures built around the cave entrance are still ministered to and provided with prayer on a daily basis. While the site had no name when the temple was built, it gets its current title due to the thousands of bats that cling to the ceiling and walls of the natural chasm, “Goa” meaning “cave” and “Lawah” meaning “bat.” It is thought that the cave may extend all the way through the mountain right to a nearby town. Legend goes that the dark recesses of the tunnel are home to a mythical snake king known as Vasuki, a massive naga that wears a crown on his head. He is said to live on the copious amounts of bats in the cavern. Yet another legend claims that a river of miraculous healing waters rushes through the depths of the cave. While the extent of the sacred cave has never been explored, stunningly intricate temple structures have been placed at the cave mouth, which are paid pilgrimage to on a daily basis in full view of the countless slumbering bats hanging around the rim. The Pura Goa Lawah is also host to a yearly festival where devout worshippers from all around come to pray at the mouth of this impressive bat cave.",bats mythology temples caves ecosystems animals

Umbrellas seem to dangle in midair above the walkway into the village, where eye-popping 3D murals abound. Like Kampung Warna-Warni, the colorful village across the river, the neighborhood’s buildings were slathered with a rainbow array of bright paint. But Kampung Tridi took things a step further. Its residents painted huge murals on its walls, many of which almost appear three-dimensional, earning it the nickname “Indonesia’s 3D Village.” The murals are quickly becoming selfie spots for tourists drawn into the lively locale. People have fun posing beneath enormous animals or standing alongside popular cartoon figures that almost look as though they’re reaching out from the walls. Kampung Tridi isn’t the only painted village within the city. The first was Kampung Warna-Warni (Painted Village), which was painted in 2015. In early 2017, Kampung Putih (White Village) was painted with white walls, grey roofs, and green accents. The newest painting project was Kampung Biru Arema, a blue and purple village completed in early 2018. These painted villages do more than just please the eye. The bright, quirky paint jobs are meant to help revitalize the communities. By bringing in tourists (and their money), the unusual art helps boost the local economies.

The gorgeous beach is also dubbed “Black Beauty” for its inky coastline. “Amed” refers to the Bali coast that stretches for about 8.5 miles and incorporates a cluster of seven villages called Amed, Jemeluk, Bunutan, Lipah, Selang, Banyuning, and Aas. In the past, these were mainly a collection of fishing villages and salt farms. Now, the area also beckons honeymooners looking to escape Bali’s more touristy spots. The reefs along the coast also attract divers and snorkelers. The water teems with various marine life. An aquatic adventure here will likely reveal tropical fish, sea turtles, coral gardens, and perhaps even the occasional shark. You’ll even discover a shipwrecked Japanese patrol boat from World War II. However, the black sand is what makes Amed Beach so remarkably unique from other Bali beaches. The sand’s color is due to the volcanic deposits in the coastal soil. It stays black year-round, a sharp contrast to the gold and white sand that hugs most of Bali’s coastline.

The effigies are tightly packed together, with generations of wooden replicas of deceased villagers standing shoulder to shoulder looking down upon trespassers for all eternity. Babies are not buried in rocks but in a tree so they will grow while the tree is growing, too.  Tana Toraja has two types of popular traditional ceremonies namely Rambu Solo and Rambu Tuka.

In 2011, geologist Dr. Danny Hilman Natawidjaja noticed something peculiar about Gunung Padang. The hill isn’t an actual hill, it’s a buried pyramid that may have been built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago. There’s even evidence of human-made chambers that show carbon-dating as far back as 26,000 years. If proven true, this claim could rewrite history as we know it and expose a forgotten civilization. The predominant understanding among historians is that all human civilization began after the last major Ice Age that covered the Earth back in 11,500 BCE. If this pyramid-like structure dates further than 11,500 BCE, then it could prove that Plato’s account of a sunken civilization in Timaeus and Critias was not merely Ancient Greek legend. What secrets lie deep inside Gunung Padang? Only further excavation will tell. Let’s hope the Indonesian government allows Dr. Natawidjaja to continue his research in spite of the outrage and protest to stop any further research from Indonesia’s archaeological establishment.

30,Prambanan,"Kecamatan Prambanan, Indonesia",This massive complex is made up of hundreds of smaller temples that date back to the ninth century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prambanan,"According to the records, the first temple in Prambanan was built around the year 850. It is believed that Rakai Pikatan, king of the Sanjaya dynasty Medang Kingdom, had it built partly as a Hindu response to the nearby Buddhist Borobudur, and partly as a marker to commemorate the return of the Sanjaya dynasty to power in Central Java. However, it was Rakai Pikatan’s successor, King Lokapala, who is responsible for expanding the complex to the massive scale that it has become famous for today. Located on the island of Java, Prambanan is one of the largest Hindu temple complexes in Southeast Asia and the largest in Indonesia. It is not a single structure, but instead hundreds of stone temples in varying shapes and sizes. Several of those temples sit on an elevated courtyard, surrounded by more than 200 smaller ones. At the center stands 47-meter (154-foot) tall temple. An inscription on the oldest temple, Lara Jonggrang, shows that it was built in honor of Lord Shiva, and it is divided into two main terraces. On the higher terrace are the shrines dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, and on the lower terrace are smaller shrines. Reliefs of the epic Ramayana can be found throughout. The Prambanan complex consists of three zones, and Lara Jonggrang is located at the physical and symbolic heart of the inner, holiest zone, which houses eight temples in all. The middle zone consists of 224 shrines, most of which bore the brunt of earthquakes and looting, but some have been restored. The outer zone was once surrounded by a wall, but the function of this area is a matter of speculation. For reasons that remain unclear, Prambanan was largely abandoned about 100 years after its completion. Many of the temples collapsed as a result of natural disasters, including volcanic eruptions and a powerful earthquake in the 16th century. Over time, the jungle reclaimed the ruins of the elaborate temple compound. In 1811, Thomas Stamford Raffles, a British surveyor, stumbled on the ruins of Prambanan while Java was under the administration of the British Empire. As colonial history unfolded, not much value was placed on Prambanan, which became the object of extensive looting. Eventually, in 1930, restoration began. To date, restoration is still ongoing.

During the parade, models present elaborate, colorful costumes made from traditional batik cloth. Wearing the costumes, the presenters dance a traditional number in the streets while accompanied by music. Indonesian batik, recognized by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2009, is made using a manual wax-resist dyeing technique. Traditional colors such as dark brown, white, and indigo are representative of the three major Hindu gods. Those familiar with the patterns of batik can determine the royal lineage of a person based on the cloth he or she is wearing. Batik is a craft that has high artistic value and has become part of the culture of Indonesia (especially Java) for a long time. Javanese women in the past made their skills in batik for a living, so in the past batik work is exclusively women’s work until the discovery of ‘Batik Cap’ which allows the entry of men into the field. Various regions of Indonesia have their own unique patterns—flowers, nature, folklore, animals—that often take their themes from everyday life. Batik fabrics and patterns can also be found in Japan, China, Malaysia, Egypt, Singapore, and several other countries. The types of batik are:
1. Batik Kraton
2. Bati sudagaran
3. Batik peasant (petani)

35,The Toba Caldera,"Ronggur Nihuta, Indonesia","Site of the largest volcanic eruption in the last 25 million years, one which may have nearly wiped out humanity altogether.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-toba-caldera-ronggur-nihuta-indonesia,"It is tough to get a grasp on the Toba event without something to compare it to. In 1980 Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted, spewing an 80,000-foot-tall plume of smoke, killing 57 people and destroying 200 homes, 27 bridges, 15 miles of railways and 185 miles of highway. It was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States. For comparison, the largest volcanic eruption in recorded modern historic times was the 1815 Mount Tambora eruption on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa. It was eighty times more powerful then Mount St. Helen’s, spewed some 100 cubic kilometers of rock, and made the entire northern hemisphere dark and cold for all of 1816, making it the “Year Without a Summer,” as it became known. But compared to the event that took place in northern Sumatra, Indonesia some 73,000 years ago, those were next to nothing. Known as the Toba Event, it ejected nearly 2,800 cubic kilometers, or twenty-eight times as the Tombora eruption, and was more than two thousand times as powerful as Mount St. Helens. It has been called the Yellowstone super volcano’s “bigger” sister, and when this Level 8 mega-colossal volcano–the highest rating on the Volcanic Explosivity Index–erupted it was the largest volcanic eruption in the last 25 million years. It may have nearly annihilated the human species. As the volcano erupted it deposited 6 meters of ash on parts of Malaysia and a 15 centimetre-thick ash layer over the entire Indian subcontinent; acid rain fell for years. The temperature of the planet fell abruptly 3–5°C and according to some (based on ice cores from Greenland) it jumpstarted a global ice age. It just so happens that this massive environmental catastrophe coincides with evidence for a massive human population decline resulting in a genetic bottleneck. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, the resulting 6- to 10-year volcanic winter destroyed most of the vegetation in the area where humans would have been living and may have reduced the population to as few a 1000 breeding pairs. There is some good evidence for this genetic bottleneck, and many geneticists feel that evidence suggests that all living humans, despite apparent variety, descend from a very small population, perhaps between 1,000 to 10,000 breeding pairs dating to about 70,000 years ago. It is also known that Eastern African chimpanzee, Bornean orangutan, central Indian macaque, and tigers all recovered from population bottelnecks dating to around the same time. All of which would seem to fit neatly with the Toba super volcano event and the Toba catastrophe theory. But as it always is in science nothing is neat or easy, and contradictory evidence is just as strong. Among the contradictory evidence are similar tools found in India below and above the ash layer suggesting a life relatively unchanged, and the fact that non-human hominids such as Homo Erectus Soloensis, Homo Floresiensis, Homo Neanderthalensis all of whom should have been just as adversely affected by the volcano, seem to have survived though the catastrophe without the same evidence of genetic bottlenecking. Regardless, whether it nearly wiped out humanity or not, for all the humans that were alive 75,000 years ago. the Toba eruption must have certainly seemed like the end of the world. Today the caldera left by the massive volcanic cataclysm is occupied by Lake Toba. At 62 miles long, 18 miles wide, and 1,666 ft its deepest point, it is the largest volcanic lake and largest volcanic structure in the world. The island in the middle was formed by the pressure of magma below pushing up on the land. Eventually, the Toba super volcano will erupt once again.  The closest major Indonesian city is Medan, and organized bus tours out of Medan to the area are plentiful; you can also hire a car. The place to visit/stay is Prapat, on the eastern shore. You can take a quick ferry across to Samosir Island, where there are numerous small hostels and restaurants. To the north on the island are ancient Toba Batak villages, including at least one with a cannibal history.  You can also reach Samosir by a thin land bridge to the west; this is a remote route and is not well supported by local infrastructure.",weird weather phenomena fiery wonders disaster areas natural wonders water nature
36,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Statue,"Kuta Selatan, Indonesia",It took 28 years to build this massive statue of the Hindu god Vishnu riding a mythical bird.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/garuda-wisnu-kencana-statue,"Garuda Wisnu Kencana is the tallest statue in Indonesia, the world’s tallest statue of a Hindu deity, and if you include its massive base, the fourth-tallest statue in the world. But it took a long, long time to seat Vishnu on his faithful bird. Back in 1990, the Indonesian artist and sculptor Nyoman Nuarta came up with the design for a truly ambitious project: the construction of a gigantic statue of the Hindu deity Vishnu riding his eagle-like mount, Garuda, to be built in southern Bali. He quickly gained some influential backers, and by 1993 the president of Indonesia, General Suharto, was also on board. Opposition by the local Balinese was ignored. Locals were against the statue, as they felt such a huge object would cause a spiritual imbalance. Primarily, they worried that all the profits from the statue would not benefit Bali at all, but end up in Jakarta. Construction of the statue began in 1997. But financial crises and other setbacks resulted in years-long periods of limbo. It wasn’t until September 2018 that the finished statue was finally inaugurated, after a full 28 years from conception to completion and at a total cost of around $100 million. Upon its inauguration, Garuda Wisnu Kencana became the tallest statue in Indonesia and the tallest statue of a Hindu god in the world. And if you include the huge base on which the statue stands, its total height of 397 feet (121 meters) ranks it as the fourth tallest statue in the world. The statue alone is 246 feet (75 meters) tall, almost 100 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty. It represents Vishnu, one of the main deities of Hinduism, riding on the back of his faithful mount Garuda, a bird-like creature who promised to serve Vishnu after the god freed Garuda’s mother from slavery. The entire structure was built from 754 modules, pieced together to form a gargantuan statue weighing more than 3,000 tons, with a steel frame covered in a copper and brass skin. On top of Vishnu’s head sits a 3.5-ton crown covered with gold-plated mosaics. And apart from its impressive height, the statue is also remarkably wide compared to more standard up-down sculpted figures. Garuda has a wingspan of 210 feet (64 meters), which might well make Garuda Wisnu Kencana the largest statue in the world in terms of sheer bulk. There were—and still are—concerns as to the use of the statue. Bali is, after all, famous on its own and attracts enough tourists without the statue. It is also unclear whether the huge cultural park surrounding the GWK serves any real purpose. However, it is at least an impressive sight in its own right. Some visitors find it more impressive than the statue itself. Though visible from much of Bali’s southern coast, the statue is usually shrouded in haze and its details are not discernible.  The statue is located inside Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park in Ungasan, Badung, on the island of Bali. It’s about 4.5 miles directly south of Ngurah Rai International Airport, with a 10- to 15-minute drive between the two. Park tickets start at Rp 70,000, or about $5.25.",hinduism world's tallest gods mythology statues

At full size, the titan can reach over 10 feet in circumference and stand 9 and a half feet tall. Known commonly as a “corpse flower” or “carrion flower”, the titan releases a scent that smells almost exactly like a corpse, and also gives off a fair amount of heat, which helps to strengthen the decaying-carrion illusion, both of which help the plant attract insect pollinators. The Amorphophallus is a distant relative of the other gigantic “corpse flower”, the Rafflesia arnoldii. Although the flower is naturally found only in Indonesia, since 1889 they have been successfully cultivated in botanical gardens around the world including Kew Gardens in London and the University of Washington, Seattle",flora plants
38,Londa Burial Caves,"Rantepao, Indonesia",The unique funeral practices of the Toraja can be seen here with graves carved into caves and hung off cliffs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/londa-burial-caves,"The Toraja are an ethnic group indigenous to South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Dutch colonizers Christianized them in the early 1900s, but their culture has continued to revolve heavily around the celebration of death, and they have some of the most complex and unique funeral practices in the world. When a loved one dies, their body is often kept in the family’s home for months—sometimes years—before eventually being buried in graves carved into the sides of the caves or hung from the outside on cliffs. The corpses are periodically removed to perform the Ma’nene ceremony, where the corpses are cleaned, redressed, and exhibited in the village before being reinterred with things they will need in the afterlife: clothes, cigarettes, and money. The funeral ceremony itself, known as Rambu Solo, is a multi-day affair filled with mourning, traditional dance, cock fights, and ritual animal sacrifice, followed by a huge feast. The higher the deceased’s status in society, the more extravagant and lengthy the ceremony. There are multiple cave burial sites that can be visited in Tana Toraja, but the most accessible to visitors is Londa. Locals rent lanterns at the entrances, and for an extra fee, will guide you through the tunnels, speaking about the residents. Above coordinates are for the Londa burial caves, located in the village of Sandan Uai, in the Sanggalangi District. It is about 7 km south of Rantepao City, the tourism centre in Toraja. Rambu Solo Ceremonies are carried out after the rice harvest in around August to September each year and the Ma'Nene celebrations typically occur in August.

39,Taman Sari Underground Mosque,"Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Subterranean place of worship in Indonesia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taman-sari-underground-mosque,"During the mid-18th century, the Sultanate of Yogyakarta began work on Taman Sari Water Castle. Comprised of lavish gardens and pools, Taman Sari also featured a bizarre man-made sea, connected beneath the ground with underwater tunnels and small island buildings. One of these island structures was used as a mosque, and was only accessible by underwater passage. The tiny mosque was only one story, and although basic, had all the necessary parts of a mosque including a mihrab, or small niche guiding worshippers toward Mecca. It also featured a series of staircases leading from the underwater entrances resembling MC Escher’s relativity. Staircases lead up from five different doorways to a central platform and another staircase connects the five lower staircases to a higher doorway. Brimming with mystery, the plain mosque is only one of the wonders of the entire Taman Sari Water Castle complex. Today, many of the remains of the great 17th century compound have been lost. Pools have been filled in, which allowed for the discovery of many of the underground structures, but have destroyed the pristine castle quality. Human settlements have taken the place of the man-made lake, and much of the other buildings left standing are worse for wear. In 1995, the entire complex was listed as a tentative World Heritage Site.",outsider architecture subterranean sites sacred spaces

Built in the 16th century as the primary residence of Maulana Hasanudin, the first sultan of Banten, this fortress-palace originally covered over 30,000 square meters. Designed by Muslim Dutchman Hendrick Lucas Cardeel, the site is known for its majestic bathing pools used by members of the royal family, as well as pavilion fountains and an impressive aqueduct and irrigation system that was connected to a nearby reservoir. The palace was also protected and encircled by a thick, two-meter high perimeter wall and a moat with waters that led to the sea. But despite its splendor and architectural ingenuity, history was not particularly kind. After a fatal attack by the Dutch East India Company in the 19th century, the palace was reduced to ruins. While the glory and grandeur of Surosowan Palace may be long gone, there’s some lingering mystical activity going on within the walls of this ancient archeological site. Legend has it that two tigers (one white, the other black) still prowl the site at night near the Old Banten Square. They’re named Sikuk and Sikumbang and are believed to have been the sultan’s pets. But in order to catch a glimpse of them, you have to say the special Arabic phrase or prayer known as salawat. Another legend has do with bathing angels. Locals say you can catch a glimpse of “eight beautiful angels” or ghostly women near one of the royal bathing pools, which is now simply a ruinous green pool. One of the angels is called Putri Kembang, or the “Flower Princess.” Ancient excavated relics and artifacts from the palace’s heyday can be found in the nearby Old Banten Archeological Museum. In front of the museum, near the mosque, you will find a cannon (called Ki Amuk) with Islamic inscriptions.

41,Candi Sukuh,"Ngargoyoso, Indonesia",This Javanese-Hindu temple from the 15th century is unmissable for anyone with even a passing interest in erotic art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/candi-sukuh,"Erotic art adorns the walls of this 15th-century Javanese-Hindu temple, which is themed around birth and sex. Visitors will stumble across phallic and yonic figures scattered throughout the sacred grounds. The centerpiece of Candi Sukuh is a truncated pyramid that sits on the third terrace of the complex. It’s surrounded by smaller structures with bas-reliefs and several statues, all directly or indirectly related to birth and sex. Among the art is a decapitated statue of a man proudly grasping his penis, several lingam (penises) and yoni (vaginas), and various figures either displaying their genitalia or engaging in sexual intercourse. A six-foot-tall phallus accompanied by four testes once topped the pyramid, but that has been relocated to the National Museum of Indonesia in Jakarta. Not all the iconography is based on birth and sex. There are also a handful of tortoises, which were believed to support the world. Two of them guard the entrance to the main pyramid. Candi Sukuh is a rare relic from the period of time when the local Hindus embraced influences from Javanese traditions and distanced themselves from more classical Indian art. It’s also one of the few examples left in the region due to the fact that many people converted to Islam about a century after its construction. It’s believed that many of the temple’s erotic features were vandalized during the Islamic invasion.",erotic pyramids sex rites and rituals temples art
42,Wehea Forest,"Muara Ancalong, Indonesia","Explore a uniquely pristine Borneo forest, now protected by former headhunters turned tour guides.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wehea-forest,"Among the ravaged landscape of East Kalimantan hides a pocket of ancient forest, tucked within a maze of palm oil plantations and logging areas. Wehea Forest is one of the few remaining protected areas in this region of Indonesia, offering a rare glimpse into a Borneo forest at its purest. Encompassing 38,000 hectares, a few parts of Wehea were logged selectively until 1996, though much of it remains untouched, primary growth. Portions of the forest are still so dense that only a small part has been explored to this day. Gazing out over such a primordial landscape offers a chance to be transported back in time. The forest is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, including Miller’s Grizzled Langur, a species of monkey thought to be extinct until scientists rediscovered it here in 2011. As of now, Wehea is the only place where they can still be found. While not the best place for wildlife viewing—a natural bi-product of a healthy forest, rife with foliage—visitors are offered the opportunity to spot orangutans, gibbons, hornbills, and even the highly elusive clouded leopard in the wild, on their own terms. Viewpoints and waterfalls are within reach via day treks from the only lodge located within the forest’s boundaries. At night, visitors may find themselves fighting for rest in the face of a cacophony of nocturnal bird calls and a burbling stream adjacent to their sleeping quarters; nature can be thunderous when permitted. In addition to its ecological significance, Wehea maintains a specific cultural significance to the region’s indigenous inhabitants. After deforestation caused increasing problems around their community, the Wehea Dayak tribe claimed the forest as traditional land in 2004, going so far as to issue customary laws to protect it. Best known for their former headhunting practices, preserving Wehea has allowed the Dayaks to maintain their strong traditional ties to the forest in the face of modernization. This same ethnic group now employs a team of forest guardians to patrol the area looking for illegal loggers and poachers. These patrol groups also serve as tour guides to the forest’s non-native visitors, reinvesting all profits from Wehea’s tourism into their ongoing conservation efforts.  Getting to Wehea is an adventure itself. The best way is to go by shared taxi from the East Kalimantan capital of Samarinda to Muara Wahau. From there, direct the driver to the village of Nehas Liah Bing, asking for the “Rumah Konservasi” (or conservation center). There, you can stay overnight in a very basic guest room before heading to the forest the next day. The forest is a 2-hour trip by truck over winding dirt roads.",cultures and civilizations forests ancient ecosystems
43,'Nest',"Pemenang, Indonesia",This underwater sculpture park is the basis for a manmade coral reef.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nest-gili-meno,"Located off the northwest coast of Lombok in Indonesia are the three Gili Islands: Gili Air, Gili Meno and Gili Trawangan. These islands are renowned for their sandy white beaches, swaying palm trees and pristine waters. They are home to a booming green sea turtle population, and in recent years the islands have become the focus for sustainable, eco-friendly tourism attractions both on shore and underwater. One of the most beautiful attractions is a project called “Nest,” which was created and installed by British sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor in 2017. Located just off the shore of Gili Meno, the smallest of the three islands, the underwater sculpture park features 48 life-sized statues based on the casts of real people. The statues, meant to symbolize the continuity of life, are arranged in a circle, with couples embracing and figures lying down. A few feet away lies another installation featuring three women lying down on their sides. Located about 13 feet under the surface, they’re made from an environmental-grade concrete designed to create a reef environment where coral, algae and sponges can grow quickly. Although only a few years old, the statues have already begun to transform into part of the landscape. Schools of colorful fish dart between legs and arms, swimming around faces whose features have become distorted with coral and algae. Not only do these underwater statues help preserve the integrity of the local ecosystem, but their existence is also an opportunity to examine the aesthetics of decay and metamorphosis in the setting of an underwater world. Taylor’s statues, which can be found in the waters of the Bahamas, Spain, and Mexico, encourage environmental awareness by reminding us of the beauty and importance of our seas and oceans.  The statues can be accessed by boat from the islands of Gili Air and Gili Trawangan. The statues are not far off the shore of Gili Meno and can be easily reached by swimming or renting a kayak.",coral reefs underwater art outside conservation sculptures

And on the island is Neptune Bar, which sits desolate and sunbaked for 362 days a year. But for a few days each year a couple of hundred sailors turn Neptune into the best bar in the world. Every Chinese New Year for the last six years, the Neptune Regatta starts from Nongsa Marina, in Batam, Indonesia with a fleet of both sailing and motor yachts for a week long race that culminates with the secret and silly ceremony of turning Pollywogs (those that have never crossed the equator on a boat) into Shellbacks (trusted sailors that have crossed the equator). The base of operations, Sikeling, is rustic at best: a kitchen area, some basic huts for sleeping and the pièce de résistance, the Neptune Bar. During the bar’s shining moment each year, everything is brought in with the fleet: ice, beer, an extraordinary amount of Mount Gay rum, cups, fruit and a stereo system that can be heard for miles. Serving hundreds of sailors drinks on a deserted island is a logistical challenge to say the least, but an epic adventure nonetheless.

45,Anak Krakatau,"Rajabasa, Indonesia",The second generation of a mighty volcano rises from the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anak-krakatau,"In the summer of 2009 the sky in Indonesia glowed an ominous orange as Anak Krakatau put on the latest of its fiery displays. Rising 1,200 feet from the waters of the Sunda Straight between the islands of Java and Sumatra, this volcano may be young - it is less than 100 years old - but it comes from legendary stock. The fifth largest volcanic explosion in history happened in August 1883 when the volcano Krakatau exploded catastrophically. The explosions stretched over two days and triggered enormous tsunamis that obliterated 165 villages and towns and killed 36,000 people officially. Unofficially it may have been many more, as the official colonial Dutch records have been questioned in the years since. Huge chunks of coral the size of freight cars were thrown onto shore and in at least one case a steamship was carried over a mile inland by a tsunami. Temperatures around the world dropped by as much as 34 degrees Fahrenheit that year, and spectacular sunsets as far away as Norway showed off the ash in the atmosphere. It was not the first time Krakatoa had blown, and there were warnings of trouble. Passing ships noted columns of smoke and debris as early as May of 1883, but the area was not evacuated. On August 26 a massive explosion was followed by several more the next day, and have been estimated to have had the force equivalent to 1300 megatons. Eyewitness Captain Wooldridge reported seeing “an immense wall, with bursts of forked lightning, at times like large serpents rushing through the air” from a distance of 40 miles, which after dark turned to “a blood-red curtain with the edges of all shades of yellow, the whole of a murky tinge, with fierce flashes of lightning.” When it was all over only the blasted edges of one of the three calderas remained, and a small rocky island called Bootsmansrots (“Bosun’s Rock” in Dutch). The rest lay submerged 800 feet below sea level. The seas were remained quiet until December 1927 when the first signs of an emerging island were seen. By August 12, 1930 the new volcano became a permanent island and was named Anak Krakatau: “Child of Krakatau”. Since then it has risen at a rate of 5 inches a week since the mid 1900s, and is now about half the height that Krakatau was when it erupted catastrophically. Its emergence was accurately predicted by Rogier Vebeek, a Dutch geologist who studied the explosion of Krakatau in the 1800s. Anak Krakatau has erupted several times in its short life, including significant eruptions in 1992, November 2007, April 2008, and most recently in July 2009. 150 years later, hundreds of thousands of people live in the potential path of Anak Krakatau. Although no one knows exactly when will be a repeat performance, it is just a question of time. After an eruption at the end of 2018 and the tsunami created by the collapse of a part of the volcano, certain aspects of the volcano are no longer visible.",fiery wonders volcanoes islands geology

Some call it the “Candy Mosque,” because of its colorful domed spires that resemble lollipops. However, it is best known as the Mosque of the Kremlin. Inspired by St. Basil’s Cathedral, which many people confuse with the Kremlin, the small mosque is similar to its cousin to the Northwest, but just a shade off. Like the misnomer in calling it the Mosque of the Kremlin, An Nurumi Mosque seems like a replica with a little less pizzaz than St. Basil’s. It is much smaller, and doesn’t even come close to the prominence of Russia’s Cathedral, centered on Red Square. In fact, a well-trafficked street allows cars to zoom past the place of worship with little reverence. Despite its drawbacks, An Nurumi is beautiful in its own right, and its off-shade light blues and pinks give the Mosque an Indonesian flair that it flaunts over the competition in Moscow. If you come to Yogyakarta and planning to visit Prambanan Temple after visiting the Sultan Palace in the city centre, you will go pass by this mosque in your journey through Jalan Raya Solo (Solo Great Street, a big inter-city road connecting Yogyakarta and neighbouring tourism city, Surakarta/ Solo). There are a few rather famous restaurants nearby such as famous Kalasan-style fried chicken restaurants and cook-your-catch seafood restaurants.If you plan to use public transport to visit this place from the Sultan Palace, Malioboro, or Tugu Jogja, it will be easier to use Transjogja Route 1A and stop at Kalasan (14 minute-walk) or Prambanan Temple (30 minute-walk).

On the island of Flores, however, the rice fields form a delightfully unique shape, one that looks like a giant spider web. This wonderful insect resemblance was not intentional, but rather the result of the traditional communal agriculture of the indigenous Manggarai people. Centuries ago, the cultivated land, known as lingko, was shared by the entire village. The communal fields were circular, with the lodok at the center, where ceremonial rituals were held around the harvest. Each family was allocated a segment of the rice field, radiating from the center outward. (Each was inaugurated by the sacrifice of a water buffalo.) The more resources a family had, the larger their slice of the pie; at the time, the rice fields were shaped like pie charts. Later, the paddies were further subdivided by the decedents of the original owners, leading to the striking, web-like shape of the lingko today.  The best examples of spider web fields can be seen in Cancar village, just west of Ruteng. Bemos and cars can be chartered from Ruteng.

48,Ternate Island,"Ternate, Indonesia",The remote island home of the overlooked explorer who co-discovered the theory of evolution by natural selection.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ternate-island,"In an 1858 letter to a friend, English naturalist and biologist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote that he’d spotted an insect whose colorings were almost imperceptible against the muddy ground it was on. He was perplexed by the markings, but, he wrote, “I have lately worked out a theory which accounts for them naturally.” Wallace was mulling over the theory of evolution by natural selection, which he identified around the same time as Charles Darwin, who would end up with most of the credit. Darwin achieved lasting fame while Wallace fell into relative obscurity. While working in separate hemispheres, Darwin and Wallace were both full of curiosity, and committed to exploring these ideas. Wallace spent nearly a decade exploring the wildlife across a remote chain of islands east of Sumatra, what was at the time the Dutch East Indies, and studying the impact of a geographical boundary on the natural world, later named The Wallace Line. He collected tens of thousands of natural specimens that would help lead to the formulation of his theory. It was during this island-hopping expedition that Wallace rented a house in Ternate, a small, lush volcanic island in eastern Indonesia, to serve as a home base. Here is where he wrote many of his scientific papers and letters. It was from Ternate that he sent a letter on March 9, 1858 to Darwin along with a detailed paper describing his theory. Darwin had come to the same conclusion on his own years earlier, and was emboldened by Wallace’s realization. They jointly published a paper arguing their groundbreaking and then-controversial theory that year. Darwin published The Origin of Species a year later, which became a sensation and would propel him to fame. While both men were brilliant, Darwin had one major advantage: He had backing from the scientific community and the money to do his work, which meant that Wallace’s work was largely unknown. Wallace collected specimens to prove his theories, and his trips to collect and learn more were funded by selling those specimens to museums and private collectors. During his travels, Wallace would take advantage of any time he spent in a city to send his findings back to other scientists and scientific journals. He would also note his findings in a journal he kept. It was his journal that would later form his seminal work, The Malay Archipelago, a bio-geographical book outlining Wallace’s finds and travels on the islands. Today, these islands are either Malaysia or Indonesian sovereignties, but as one researcher noted, in Wallace’s time these would have been “a great Milky Way of land masses and seas and straits, little explored by Europeans, sparsely populated by peoples of diverse cultures, and harboring countless species of unknown plant and animal in dense tropical forests.” In other words, a researcher’s dream. Wallace cataloged plants and animals (“It is remarkable that an animal so large, so peculiar and of such a high type of form as the orang-utan (sic) should be confined to such a limited district”), and tasted local foods (Wallace on durian fruit: “a rich butter-like custard highly flavored with almonds generally gives the best idea of it, but intermingled with it comes wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion sauce, brown-sherry, and other incongruities”). He wrote in flowery prose about catching butterflies (“My heart began to beat violently, the blood rushed to my head, and I felt much more like fainting than I have done when in apprehension of immediate death.”), and he tracked the months and miles and species that eventually led him to his most notable achievement. The tiny island of Ternate may have been lost to obscurity as well if not for a resurgence of interest in the scientist. Today, tours of the island are even offered to allow visitors to follow in Wallace’s footsteps. One spectacular local bird, which can be found inhabiting the neighboring islands of Halmahera and Bacan, was named Semioptera wallacii (Wallace’s Standard-wing Bird of Paradise) after Wallace who collected the first specimens. Over 100,000 specimens collected during Wallace’s exploration of the islands were sold to British museums and collectors. Unfortunately, there is no plaque honoring Wallace on Ternate, and, according to Wallace historian Dr. George Beccaloni, it is likely that the house where Wallace lived and worked is no longer there. However, the beauty of the island—which Wallace wrote as having “grand views on every side,” and “lofty volcanic peaks” with huge mountains rising behind them covered in “perpetually faint wreaths of smoke … calm and beautiful” is itself worth seeing. You can still explore the impressive old Fort Oranje, which was just below Wallace’s house, and imagine the wonders he saw and the mysteries he wanted to unlock, ultimately forming a theory that would change the way that people viewed the natural world.",naturalists biodiversity fauna exploration geographic markers flora islands science plants nature animals

Also known as “Equator City,” Pontianak is the capital city in the province of West Kalimantan. Standing a mere two miles north from the city center is a monument constructed to represent the otherwise conceptual equator. The spot was first marked simply with an arrow on a pole in 1928 by a Dutch geographer when he visited Borneo. The first monument, originally consisting of four wooden pillars surrounding the pole, was rebuilt ten years later by architect Silaban who turned the simple marker into a permanent monument. A globe was added to cap off the work, and a guard was added to keep it safe. A dome was finally built over the landmark in 1990 to cover the original monument and a grander replica, five times the size of the original marker monument, was added to the top. Due to constant global shift, the monument no longer lies on the exact line of the equator. In 2005, the true equatorial line was recorded a short distance south of the monument and, according to GPS readings, the line continues to move south. Despite this increasing inaccuracy, the city of Pontianak holds a party each year during the time of the spring and autumn solstices, when the shadows of the monument and everything around it disappear at noon.",location markers geographic markers monuments
50,Grasberg Mine,"Tembagapura, Indonesia",This mile-wide crater high in the mountains of Indonesia is the largest gold mine in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grasberg-mine,"The Grasberg Mine is a vast open pit mine in Papua, Indonesia, forming a crater an entire mile wide. For years it has been one of the most productive mines in the world, with massive reserves of gold and copper. Situated high in the rugged Sudirman Mountains near two rare equatorial mountain glaciers, it is also the world’s highest quarry, some 14,000 feet above sea level. This massive mine sits at the collision point of two tectonic plates, where millions of years ago hot magma intruded into sedimentary rock layers during the uplift of the local mountains, resulting in the formation of copper- and gold-bearing ore. Since the early 1990s, the Grasberg operation has been busily extracting this ore at a staggering volume. In 2016, the vast mine produced more than 1 billion pounds of copper and 1 million ounces of gold. Once the precious metal is extracted, it is crushed in the mine’s milling and concentrating complex, which is the largest in the world. The grinding units at the mill can process a daily average of 265,000 tons of ore. The ore is then sent in a slurry along three pipelines to the seaport of Amamapare, over 70 miles away. It is filtered and dried at the port, after which the copper, gold, and silver can be shipped to smelters around the world. Today, the pit mine has been all but exhausted. But while production has temporarily fallen away, the huge reserves of gold and copper remain—albeit deeper underground. Grasberg is now transitioning to underground block carving, with underground mines replacing the work in the pit. Unsurprisingly, such a massive mining project has not gone without its share of controversy. To start are the environmental concerns: Each year, the mine dumps tens of millions of tons of waste into the local river system, which is now almost devoid of fish and generally considered unsuitable for aquatic life. Freeport-McMoRan, the U.S. company in charge of the mine, has long insisted that its practices meet industry standards. That, however, is not a position held by environmental groups and local citizens. Tensions have also flared at Grasberg due to the low share of revenue going to local Papuans, and questionable payments made by the mine to the Indonesian security forces that protect it.  Grasberg Mine is located in the village of Tembagapura in the Papua province of Indonesia. It’s about 60 miles north of Timika, and not far from Puncak Jaya, the highest mountain in Papua. Tours of the mine can be arranged.",copper gold environment world's largest mines
51,Blanco Renaissance Museum,"Kecamatan Ubud, Indonesia","Visitors to this museum will find architectural oddities, an art gallery, and an unlikely bird sanctuary.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blanco-renaissance-museum,"Dedicated to the life and work of Don Antonio Blanco, this complex in Bali is a mansion turned art gallery. In 2004, the building also became a bird sanctuary after it gained legal permission from the government to act as a conservation area. The Bali myna, also known as Rothschild’s mynah, Bali starling, or Bali mynah is a critically endangered bird with fewer than 100 adults existing in the wild. The sanctuary has helped increase the species’ population with a government-approved breeding program. Blanco lived and worked in his magical hilltop home until his death in 1999. The museum has a collection of more than 300 works from the artist. There is also an exhibition called the Erotic Room, which displays a large collection of paintings featuring the elegance of the male and female bodies. However, to enter this chamber visitors must be older than 17. There is also a painting studio inside that was often used by Blanco. The stone arch over the top of the stairs, the Kori Agung, is actually a giant signature of Blanco. It was created by folding the paper vertically while the paint was wet and doubling the signature. There is a little cafe inside as well, a nice place to sit after taking in the artwork.

The trees’ branches bear more than just fruit: they’re also draped with coconut shells containing human placentas. In Bali, Indonesia, a newborn’s placenta is seen as an invisible, spiritual sibling to the child (the word for placenta, Ari-Ari, translates to “younger sibling”). Traditionally, the placentas are bathed in fragrant, floral water, then sealed inside a coconut shell before being buried beneath a plant within the family’s yard. But the village of Bayung Gede has a different custom. In this village’s Setra Ari-Ari (placenta graveyard), the placenta-carrying coconuts are hung from the branches of the bukak trees, forming a sacred garden. The residents of Bayung Gede have been following this unique tradition for centuries. According to local legend, the custom is as old as the village itself. It’s believed that the bukak tree’s sap and fruit can help absorb the smell of the decaying organs. After a tree has been adorned with placentas, its branches are sliced to better release the sap held within.  It is worth noting that the ground-breaking anthropologist Margaret Mead lived in Bayung Gede from 1936 to 1939. Rumor has it that her western-style toilet, which was an object of fascination for the locals, still exists in the village.",coconut anatomy flora tradition rites and rituals graveyards gardens trees cemeteries plants
53,Mie Lethek Garuda,"Srandakan, Indonesia","In this rare traditional factory, three generations of know-how, several strong cows, and a one-ton mortar come together to make Yogyakarta's famous ""ugly noodles.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mie-lethek-garuda,"It’s hard work being a cow. If you happen to be one in the village of Srandakan, in Indonesia’s Yogyakarta Sultanate, you may avoid a more grisly culinary fate by spending your days walking in circles to turn a six-foot-wide, one-ton mortar. This mortar grinds dried cassava and sweet potatoes into flour for use in mie lethek, Yogyakarta’s signature noodle variety. As thanks for all that hard work, you’ll eat a steady diet of sweet grass meant to keep you strong and healthy. But it’s the end result that really matters: You’ll be part of the culinary legacy of Srandakan’s Mie Lethek Garuda, the last remaining traditional mie lethek factory. Mie lethek means “ugly noodles,” dubbed so because the blend of cassava and sweet potato flours yields squiggly carbs of a pasty, grayish tint. More appealingly, the noodles have a delicate sweet-potato flavor and chewy texture. They’re a regional specialty of Yogyakarta, which is the last remaining Indonesian region to be ruled by a Sultanate. Served either fried or boiled, with eggs, chicken, vegetables, garlic, and candlenuts—an oily nut with a flavor similar to macadamia nuts—they are famously delicious. Barack Obama, the former United States president, is said to have enjoyed mie lethek on a visit to Yogyakarta, though no word on whether those noodles came from the Garuda factory or a more high-tech equivalent. Yasir Feri, the current owner of Mie Lethek Garuda, credits his grandfather with the invention of these noodles. Feri’s grandfather was a Yemeni immigrant who married a local woman of Chinese descent. It was Feri’s grandmother who had the bright idea to try out cassava flour, and she supplied the noodle-making experience that led to the factory’s success. They opened up shop in the 1940s. Eighty years and two generations later, the younger Feri is the last producer to continue making mie lethek by hand, cow and all. After grinding the cassava and sweet potato flour, factory workers mix it into dough, which they then manually press into noodle form. Then, workers steam the resulting noodles and dry them in the sun for at least a day before sending them to local markets and for distribution throughout Yogyakarta. Today, the Garuda factory employs around 30 local workers. While Feri could certainly sit back, relax, and savor his status as noodle king, he continues to work alongside his employees, many of whom have been around since his parents’ tenure as factory managers. And of course, Feri always remembers to save some sweet grass for his loyal cows, who have helped give the world a beautiful gift in the form of an ugly noodle.  As in many rural areas, the Garuda factory doesn't have a conventional address. But the factory itself is a well-known landmark in Srandakan, a small village in Bantul district. If you're interested in paying the factory a visit, your hotel owners or host in Bantul should be able to show you the way and help arrange transportation. Otherwise, you can try Garuda's noodles in restaurants and markets across Yogyakarta.",noodles potatoes cows factories
54,Mount Tambora,Indonesia,Mount Tambora is the site of the largest and deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded human history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-tambora,"Mount Tambora (Gunung Tambora) is a 9,354 foot-tall volcanic mountain located on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa and is the site of the largest volcanic eruption in the past 2,000 years. When the volcano erupted in April 1815, the mountain lost about 4,000 feet of elevation and created a five mile wide, half-mile deep caldera. The eruption was also the deadliest ever in recorded human history, killing an estimated 60,000 to 120,000 people from pyroclastic flows, ashfall, and the poisoning of water and soil. The reach of the volcanic eruption was felt far beyond Indonesia. The sulfur ejected into the atmosphere disrupted weather patterns around the globe, causing what would be known as “The Year Without a Summer.” Cold and wet weather destroyed crops and helped spur epidemics like typhus and dysentery that destroyed vulnerable populations. It’s said that this period inspired Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly to write her classic, Frankenstein. The volcano is also partially blamed for a cholera epidemic that began in the Bengal region of India in 1817 and created the world’s first cholera pandemic. Views from the top of Tambora are stunning and provide a peek into the caldera itself. Tambora is still an active volcano and fumaroles (steam vents) can usually be seen at the bottom of the caldera. A myriad of endemic birds and plants can also be found along the trail.  The area around Tambora was made into a national park in 2015, but there is little infrastructure for visitors. The summit, which is at the edge of the massive caldera, can be reached by a two to three-day roundtrip moderate hike. Hikes in the caldera are possible as well. Most people start the hike in the village of Pancasila, although other routes are available. A guide is recommended, especially for hikers that want to walk the last section of the trail in the early morning to see the summit at sunrise. A car route is available partway up the western side of the mountain and the Indonesian government is planning for new 4-wheel-drive roads in the park. Watch out for leeches and a local stinging nettle called jelatang. Dress warmly for the summit.",volcanoes mountains geology nature history & culture

In and around Banda Aceh, 90,000 people died, and about a third of the city was destroyed. When the giant wave swept ashore, it carried this boat with it. The boat was deposited on top of a house and survived the storm, sheltering dozens of people who lived in the area and who may not have survived otherwise. One survivor described the sound of the boat hitting the roof of the house as “like thunder.” The group spent seven hours in the boat, waiting until the waters receded to leave it. Because it saved those people from the flood, the boat is sometimes called “Noah’s Ark.” Other boats were stranded on the roofs of the city, but this is the only one of those that was left where it landed. Another, larger stranded ship, the PLTD Apung 1, was stranded further inland and has been turned into a memorial. While the stranded Noah’s Ark saved people during the flood, the Apung 1 crushed two houses with people still inside. The boat is near the harbor, and there should be signs, reading ""Kapal di atas rumah,"" guiding the way. The boat is well-known locally, and it should be possible to hire a bike or car to go directly there.",disasters boats

Beginning in 1992, the 2 kilometers-worth of travel spans took their names from 15th- to 18th-century rulers of the Riau Sultanate, and are made up of a selection of engineering greatness. The longest bridge, the Tengku Fisabilillah (connects Batam and Tonton island), is a cable-stayed bridge that has 642 meters of stretch, and is by far the most popular of the bunch due to its regal appearance and size. Narasinga (Tonton-Nipah) and Sultan Zainal Abidin (Setokok-Rempang) are cantilever bridges, 320 m. and 365 m., respectively. Ali Haji (Setokok-Nipah) Bridge is a girder bridge, and stretches a good 270 meters, and Tuanku Tambusai (Rempang-Galang Bridge) is an arch bridge, 385 m. in all. The last is the Raja Kecil Bridge on Galang Island (Galang-New Galang), the smallest of the six. Although Raja Kecil Bridge is the smallest, the historical value of the island it connects is very high. Sijantung Village of Galang Island was previously used to accomodate 250,000 Vietnam refugees (1975-1996) which buildings and remains could still be seen today. Despite the fact that each bridge has its own identity, they are seen as one, in the sense that they have brought this entire pocket of islands a way to connect their communities and improve access, and they are referred to as a whole, simply as The Barelang Bridge.",inventions bridges architectural oddities architecture

One of these is Sipiso-piso waterfall, which translates literally as “like a knife.” An underground river that runs along the Karo Plateau comes to a sudden 390-foot plunge before joining the waters of the lake. Water pours out of an opening in the cliff as if it had just broken through it. Sipiso-piso is located in the hills, at an altitude of about 2,600 feet above sea level. The land surrounding the falls is filled with pine forests. In Sumatra, vegetation tends to be lush, but a massive waterfall is a never-ending source of mist, and the resulting emerald-green of the nearby flora is simply spectacular. A well-trodden but badly maintained trail leads from the main viewpoint down to the base of the waterfall.  It requires medium physical fitness to descend and, above all, ascend back to the viewpoint.  There is a snack shop along the way up/down.

It’s not complicated, and the act is exactly as it sounds. Boys become men on the island by leaping over a stone wall, sometimes as high as six feet. Before Bawomataluo, a city on the island of Nias became a hotbed for tourist activity and Western backpackers, the stone jump was a ritual taken very seriously. Boys leapt to their adulthood, dressed in warrior garb, signifying that they were ready to fight and assume the responsibilities of men. Leaping the stone barrier, ranging in height from 1.5-2 meters, was essentially a final task in warrior training. There is even some historical indication that sharpened bamboo was placed atop the barrier to increase the stakes of the jump. Today, the jump is still taken seriously and many boys begin training at a young age.

Once in the pool, the devotees start at the leftmost spout, and then move from one spout to another. At each spout, they clasp their hands and bow under the spout while the holy spring water washes over them. The temple itself was designed around a natural spring around the 10th-century CE. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu.  Tirta Empul is located near Tampak Siring village, about 30 minutes drive northeast of Ubud. This temple is considered holy, so bare knees and bare shoulders are not acceptable. It is best to wear a sarong while visiting.

A caldera is a depression left after a volcano erupts. Inside the circular Tengger caldera, there are five volcanoes: Bromo, Batok, Kursi, Watangan and Widodaren. Of these, only Batok is inactive. When it comes to one or more volcanoes inside a caldera, size matters. Extending from Semeru, the tallest volcano in Java, the Tengger caldera measures 16 kilometers (10 miles) across. The massive volcanic complex dates back to about 820,000 years ago and consists of five overlapping stratovolcanoes.  Gunung Bromo is the youngest and most active of the five, with more than 50 eruptions documented since 1804. Bromo’s eruptions can be explosive and are often preceded by little to no warning. Though it reaches a respectable altitude of 2,329 meters (7,641 feet), Bromo measures just 133 meters (436 feet) tall from its base. The perfectly cone-shaped volcano is significant to the local Tenggerese people. In fact, the name Bromo stems from the Javanese pronunciation of Bhrama, the Hindu god of creation. As a way of demonstrating appreciation to Bhrama, during the Yadnya Kasada festivities, locals gather on top of Gunung Bromo to pray and make offerings. Surrounding these volcanoes is a vast expanse of black sand known as the Tengger Sand Sea. A unique ecosystem covered in volcanic sediment, the Tengger Sand Sea has been a protected nature reserve since 1919.  Gunung Bromo can be reached from the nearby village Cemoro Lawang.  It’s about a 45-minute hike. Jeeps and horses are also available for covering the distance.

But the plane never made it out of Bali. At around 10:26 p.m. local time, the Boeing 707-321B, registered N446PA with the name of Clipper Climax was on its final approach into Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar. The craft was flying at an altitude of 900 meters when it crashed into the 1,200-meter high Mount Mesehe 68 kilometers northwest of the airport. A navigational error, possibly caused by malfunctioning instrumentation, caused the pilot to make a premature righthand turn, which led to the impact with the mountain. The crash location was in a steep, densely jungled area of an inactive volcano. Due to the difficulty of the terrain it took a full day for anybody could get to the site. Unable to access the area by helicopter, 300 Indonesian army personnel ascended the mountain by foot to recover the bodies. No survivors were reported, and just 43 out of 107 passenger and crew’s bodies were recovered. A monument to all lost in the devastating crash was established shortly after on the remote banks of the Ayung River, near the sacred Padang Galak beach. Over the intervening 40 years it was largely forgotten about and deteriorated. A passenger aboard the flight was Maurice Raymond, the Corporate Vice-President for Food & Beverage of Hilton International and in 2014 the memorial underwent restoration by workers from the Conrad Bali Resort and Spa, part of the Hilton network.

It is home to the longest hiking route on the island of Java, which is about 63 kilometers in length. The ascent takes six days and five nights. The massive volcanic complex that Mount Argopuro is part of dominates the landscape between the Raung and Lamongan volcanoes in East Java. The mountain has not had a major eruption within at least the last 500 years—though there was an unverified report of an eruption in 1597. In addition, Mount Argopuro is currently a mountain that is rarely visited by climbers because it has been closed for more than a year, so many routes are still “virgin” because they are covered with shrubs, fallen trees and have to cut down bushes to break through the path.  You can do the trip to Mount Argopuro by taking a bus to Besuki City and then an ojek to the Baderan Post, which is a post to start the climb. For the use of private vehicles, you can go directly to Baderan Post, but make sure you use a 4WD vehicle considering the difficult terrain. Based on the level of difficulty Argopuro has a rating of number 9, which is one level below Mount Semeru (Mahameru Peak, The highest mountain on the Java Island).

It’s not at an airport or an airplane boneyard. Instead, it sits in a field near some kind of limestone quarry, and no one quite knows how it got there. The abandoned plane is located near the southern coast of the Bukit Peninsula in Bali. It’s just off the Raya Nusa Dua Selatan Highway and only five minutes from the popular and picturesque Pandawa beach. In other words, it’s not exactly hidden away from the world. What makes it even stranger is that no one seems to know how it got there. You’d think someone would notice the arrival of a Boeing 737 in a field near a fairly major road, but…no. Some locals say that the plane, which has no livery or notable insignia, was destined to be converted into a tourist-friendly restaurant. Apparently, however, the owner ran out of money and left his Boeing 737 to slowly rust surrounded by a shabby hut and a few shipping containers. Apart from that, little is known about abandoned aircraft. It may have been purchased and reassembled where it now stands, which would explain, at least in part, why no one saw it arrive. The plane has now become a tourist attraction in its own right. And, strangely, it’s not the only abandoned plane you can visit on the Indonesian island. About five miles north sits another abandoned Boeing 737, right next to a Dunkin’ Donuts. In mid-2018, the plane was opened as an event venue. As of October 21, 2021, (if you have Google Earth Pro), you can see that this aircraft, and at least one other, are being dismantled as many parts have been removed and the fuselage has been moved to a different location closer to the road.  The abandoned Boeing 737 in the south of the Bukit Peninsula is easy enough to reach, as long as you can spot it from the road. The view of the plane is obstructed from the highway, so you need to keep your eyes open, or you could easily miss it. When you come across a wall of sea containers on the side of the road, you are have arrived. You can see the plane by climbing up onto the containers that surround it. Or, for a better view, head slightly further down the road where you’ll find a path that leads up above the plane.

Known in the west for its films such as Spirited Away, the museum’s design was informed by Hayao Miyazaki’s personal vision. He didn’t want it to become yet another boring pile of exhibits. Instead, he “put it together as if it were a film,” creating a series of rooms with motifs from every single piece of animation he had produced or found interesting, visitable in any order. The result is like stepping into the wizard’s cottage whilst he is away, with artist’s materials, animation cells, and sketchbooks preserved alongside overflowing ashtrays and cardboard boxes filled with reusable pencil stubs. The motifs begin when you step off the bright yellow bus - the bus stop is in the shape of the studio’s mascot, Totoro. One particular delight is the room that showcases different methods of animation, which draws your gaze from the zoetrope near the entrance, on past the moving wooden figures, pausing to see the stop-motion carousel spin up, then stopping dead at the Heath Robinson-like film projector in a glass case to view the “evolution of man” movie at different points in the projector. Another, sadly for under-12s only, is the playroom that holds a plush Catbus complete with chuckable Soot Sprites.

You receive your ticket when you arrive, and may have to wait for 5-15 minutes to get seats. Photography is prohibited inside the building except in the rooftop garden, which is dominated by a huge bronze figure from Laputa: Castle in the Sky. There is also a cafe, gift shop, and bookshop inside, and a picnic park outside where families can sit under the cherry blossoms in March/April.  Access is strictly limited - only 200 admissions per day for overseas visitors. Tickets must be purchased in advance; there is no ticket office at the museum.  Tickets go on sale on the web in advance beginning on the 10th of the month beforehand, starting at 10 a.m. and sell out quickly, within days or hours. Tickets can also be purchased in Japan at Loppi kiosks at Lawson convenience stores. The best way to get to it is by train and bus. Train: Take the JR Chuo Main Line west from Shinjuku Station to Mitaka Station to catch the bus. Most large stations will have maps in both Japanese and English. (Do NOT go to Mita Station on the Yamanote Line, which is entirely different.) Bus: From Mitaka Station, go to the South Exit and move towards the bus stands nearby and slightly to your left. Buy the ticket to the museum from the attendant and wait for the museum bus, which is unmistakable - bright yellow and covered with cartoon characters. Alternatively, if you have a map to guide you, you can get off at Kichijoji Station (one stop before Mitaka Station) and walk 1.4 kilometers (just under a mile) through Inokashira Park to reach the museum at the far edge of the park.",amusement parks museums and collections art museums

A member of the pea family, wisteria is an ornamental vine, wildly popular in both Eastern and Western gardens for its graceful hanging flowers and its ornate, winding branches. Easily trained, the woody vines tend to reach maturity within a few years, at which point they bloom in cascades of long, lavender flowers of varying pastel shades. There are about 150 flowering wisteria plants of roughly 20 species that create this famous colorful flower tunnel. Make sure to visit in late April or Early May, during the “Fuji Matsuri,” or “Wisteria Festival,” when the magical tunnel is in full bloom. Because many visitors come to the gardens during the blooming season, you need to book your time slot in advance. Arrive at any other time of year, and its appearance will be a disheartening mass of lifeless, twisted branches.  Take the Shinkansen to Kokura station. Change to the JR Kagoshima line for Yahata station. From Yahata station, take the Nishitetsu bus to Kawachi Syougakou mae (Kawachi Elementary School). Buses only run once an hour or so, and the stop is not close.

70,Cat Island,"Ishinomaki, Japan","On Japan's Tashirojima Island, cats are king.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cat-island,"On the island of Tashirojima in the Miyagi Prefecture, the cats outnumber people, and the people like it that way. It’s no accident that the cats who inhabit Tashirojima—or what has become known as “Cat Island”—in Japan have come to be the island’s primary residents. Cats have long been thought by the locals to represent luck and good fortune, and doubly so if you feed and care for them. Thus, the cats are treated like kings, and although most are feral because keeping them as “pets” is generally considered inappropriate, they are well-fed and well-cared-for. Despite this, luck and fortune haven’t exactly come to the human residents of “Cat Island.” In the last 50 years, the human population of the island has dwindled from 1,000 to fewer than 100. As more and more people have shunned the island as it became dominated by felines, the people that have remained have become ever more protective of the cats. Currently, dogs are not allowed on the island to protect the well-being of the cats—and presumably any dog foolish enough to venture onto an island full of feral cats. There is even a small cat shrine (Neko-jinja 猫神社 in Japanese) in the middle of the island to commemorate an accidentally killed cat. The cats may end up bringing luck after all, however. Tourism has been picking up as the island has become an attraction for curious travelers, thanks to all of those cats.  It can be difficult to find cat food on the island, so if you opt to bring some treats, drop by a convenience store before taking the ferry. This is not the only cat island in Japan. Another popular spot is Aoshima island in Ehime Prefecture with about 150 cats and about a dozen human residents.",animal week cats cultures and civilizations islands animals
71,Jigokudani Monkey Park,"Yamanouchi, Japan",Hot springs monkey spa in the middle of Hell's Valley.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jigokudani-park-japan,"So named because of the area’s eerie bubbling hot springs, harsh landscape, and snowy frigid climate, Jigokudani translates to “Hell’s Valley”. Snow covers the ground more than four months out of every year and the valley is lined with jagged cliffs, jutting over 2,500 feet into the air. The park is most famous for its population of Japanese Macaques, also known as Snow Monkeys, the most northern living non-human primates. Sometime in the early ’60s these clever characters decided to test the waters of the natural hot springs, and they’ve descended from the forest to warm up in their steamy discovery every winter since. Some of the hot springs even reach temperatures above 122 degrees Fahrenheit, which is perfect for warming monkeys along with visitors to the region. Although not technically a religious site, the Snow Monkeys are popular in Japanese fables and are believed to be messengers of the Shinto mountain gods and rivers. Although the region is remote, there is no doubt that seeing monkeys on a spa retreat is probably a surreal and spiritual experience all on its own.  Jigokudani Monkey Park is located near Yamanouchi town. The closest large city is Nagano, which is about 40 to 45 minutes away. You can find an exact list of bus times to/from the snow monkey park at the Nagano train station. An express bus from Nagano is 1,400 yen to the park entrance. You can also take a local train from Nagano to Yudanaka Station and from there take a local bus or taxi to the park entrance. From the park entrance it is a 1.6 km walk to the park itself. Snow boots and jackets can be rented from the information center, as the ground can be slippery in the winter. Monkeys are fed during the morning, bath in the hot springs after, then head off into the night to sleep, so it's best to visit early to mid-day to get the view of both the feeding frenzy and the bathing. The park can be visited year round but winter is the best time to visit when everything is covered in snow.",monkeys hot springs natural wonders water nature animals

From the decor to the dishes, every last detail is crafted to create a vast and eerie dining landscape. While sitting at red-covered thrones, diners can sip a dark red aperitif garnished with tiny skulls. The light from candles atop coffins flicker with a supernatural aura powerful enough to make Bram Stoker work up an appetite for more blood-soaked treats as baroque music drones through the dim restaurant.

73,The Giant Ghibli Clock,"Tokyo, Japan",Tokyo’s only Vaudeville-cuckoo clock–steampunk-Victorian curio cabinet time piece.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-giant-ghibli-clock-tokyo-japan,"Officially called the “NI-Tele Really BIG Clock,” four or five times a day this wacked-out symphonic mega-machine spins, dances, whirs and clanks. And as a side gig, it also tells the time. The giant clock is in the Shiodome section of Tokyo, at the Nittele Tower (headquarters of Nippon Television). It was designed by Hayao Miyazaki, the renowned director and co-founder of Studio Ghibli, and while it’s not exactly drawn from his 2004 film Howl’s Moving Castle, it’s been likened to the aesthetic of the anime classic. The clock is huge: over 20 tons of copper and steel, three stories high and 60 feet wide. Besides chiming out the time, there are over 30 mechanical vignettes at appointed hours, including cannons, a couple of blacksmiths, a wheel spinner, boiling teapot and two bell-headed piston crankers. They all move in a delicate and industrious ballet, some reminiscent of a cuckoo clock and others like 19th century tin toys. The clock springs to life four times on Monday to Friday, with an extra show on Saturdays and Sundays. Each performance begins about four minutes ahead of the hour, and you can see it from many different spots around the Nippon TV tower. But get as close as you can so you can really see the detail. Anime fan or not, Miyazaki’s clock is crazy with detail.  The clock is located in front of the Nittele Tower (Nippon Television headquarters). It jumps into action every day at noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 .p.m, and there is an extra morning chime on Saturdays and Sundays at 10 a.m. It’s a good idea to get there a few minutes early, so you’re ready when the music begins and the wheels start to turn. Take the Yurikamome Line to the Shiodome station or get off at Shimbashi station where several of the main lines meet.",steampunk mechanical instruments time clocks
74,Aokigahara Forest,"Fujinomiya-shi, Japan","A beautiful, dense forest in the shadow of Mount Fuji, with a tragic reputation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aokigahara-suicide-forest,"The Aokigahara forest in Japan has the unfortunate distinction of being a destination for people who are contemplating suicide. Since the 1950s, recorded suicides in the forest have been rising at an increasing rate of between 10 and 30 per year. In 2003, a record number of 105 suicide victims were discovered here. Japanese spiritualists believe that the suicides committed in the forest have permeated Aokigahara’s trees, generating paranormal activity and preventing many who enter from escaping the forest’s depths. Complicating matters further is the common experience of compasses being rendered useless by the rich deposits of magnetic iron in the area’s volcanic soil. Due to the vastness of the forest, desperate visitors are unlikely to encounter anyone once inside the so-called “Sea of Trees,” so the police have mounted signs reading “Your life is a precious gift from your parents,” and “Please consult the police before you decide to die!” on trees throughout. This does not deter determined people from committing suicide in this dense forest. Each year dozens of corpses are found by volunteers who clean the woods, but many are forever lost in the very thick woods. Japanese authorities have discontinued publishing exact suicide numbers in order to avoid making the place even more popular. Contemporary news outlets have noted the recent spike in suicides in the forest, blaming them more on Japan’s economic downturn than on the romantic ending of Seicho Matsumoto’s novel Kuroi Jukai, which revitalized the so-called suicide forest’s popularity among those determined to take their final walk. (The novel culminates in Aokigahara as the characters are driven to joint-suicide.) Locals say they can easily spot the three types of visitors to the forest: trekkers interested in scenic vistas of Mount Fuji, the curious hoping for a glimpse of the macabre, and those souls who don’t plan on leaving. What those hoping to take their lives may not consider is the impact the suicides have on those living near an area famous for being a suicide spot. A local police officer said, “I’ve seen plenty of bodies that have been really badly decomposed, or been picked at by wild animals… There’s nothing beautiful about dying in there.” According to some reports, forest workers must carry the bodies from the forest to the local police station, where they are put in a special room used specifically to house suicide corpses. Some believe that if a corpse is left alone, it is very bad luck for the yurei (ghost) of the suicide victims. Their spirits are said to scream through the night, and that their bodies will move on their own. In January 2018, the forest gained international attention after a YouTuber filmed and broadcast a suicide victim’s body on his popular channel. If you visit, be respectful if you do come across any victims of suicide. Contact the local authorities so they can appropriately handle the situation. It’s a somber place; one where the gravity of the circumstances should not be taken lightly. If you’re struggling with thoughts of suicide, there are international resources available for help. Many of these mental health hotlines are available 24/7 to anyone in distress.  If you're interested in hiking in the forest, it's located approximately two hours' driving time west-southwest from Tokyo. Accessible without a car. Must take the Fujikyu Railway to Kawaguchiko train station then the Retro Bus. Entrance is in the parking lot of the Lake Sai Bat Cave.",suicide forests memento mori death trees ecosystems plants

Built in 1990, Sanrio Puroland is any Sanrio fan’s dream. Not unlike Disneylands across the globe (including the one in Japan), the bright, loud, and eye-poppingly ornate theme park allows visitors to mix and mingle with their favorite super-deformed animals, not just Hello Kitty. They can visit Badtz Maru the penguin’s cave, Keroppi the frog’s pond, or even Hello Kitty’s own house in which everything is shaped like her head. The effect of walking through a blaring candy-colored cartoon is broken only by the live stage shows and fireworks around each turn, all of which is presented in a distinctly over-the-top and uniquely Japanese style. Of course there are also rides, such as the innocuously named “Sanrio Character Boat Ride,” which is near identical to the It’s A Small World ride at California’s Disneyland, simply seen through a hyperactive pastel lens. Despite the similarities to Mickey Mouse’s various wonderlands, Puroland is still unique among theme parks in its singular devotion to saccharine cuteness. Most people are well aware of Hello Kitty’s influence around the world, but again, much like Disneyland opened visitors’ eyes to their vast world of marketable Western animation beyond their iconic mouse, Puroland proves that Sanrio has just as deep a bench if you can handle the sweetness.  About a 10-minute walk from Tama-Center Station; to get here from central Tokyo, take the Keiō Line train from Shinjuku Station, which should be roughly 35 minutes' ride.",amusement parks television

Walking down the packed narrow alleyway your senses are drawn in a hundred different directions. The entire market is just five blocks long, but over 150 stalls, some barely big enough for a chef to stand in, make it feel much bigger. There are traditional delicacies like freshly pounded mochi, Japanese pickles, sweet red beans prepared in a multitude of ways, and of course, Kyoto’s famous tofu. Some stalls will offer free samples, while the more expensive items may cost a few yen.  Just about everything at Nikishi Market will reward an adventurous palate. Baby octopus with a boiled quail egg in its brain cavity, soy donuts, barbecued quail, grilled squid, candied kumquats, and pickled gourds are all for sale, as well as more traditional fare like sushi, tofu, and tea. A few stalls sell non-comestibles as well. The inexplicably various shoe vendors, and Aritsugu, one of Japan’s finest knife-making shops, has had a stall here since the year 1510.

There are hiking trails too, some of which date back to the Edo period (the 17th through mid-19th centuries). It is also notable because it served as an inspiration for Studio Ghibli’s Princess Mononoke, which addresses the tension between humans and nature spirits in the forest setting.

78,Gunkanjima Island,"Nagasaki, Japan","Once the most densely populated place in the world, this island is now a ghost town.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gubkanjima-island,"Few places in the world have a history as odd, or as poignant as Gunkanjima’s. The tiny, fortress-like island (also known as “Hashima” or “Battleship Island”) lies just off the coast of Nagasaki. The island is ringed by a seawall, covered in tightly packed buildings, and entirely abandoned - a ghost town that has been completely uninhabited for more than forty years. In the early 1900s, Gunkanjima was developed by the Mitsubishi Corporation, which believed - correctly - that the island was sitting on a rich submarine coal deposit. For almost the next hundred years, the mine grew deeper and longer, stretching out under the seabed to harvest the coal that was powering Japan’s industrial expansion. By 1941, the island, less than one square kilometer in area, was producing 400,000 tonnes of coal per year. And many of those working slavishly in the undersea mine were forced laborers from Korea. Even more remarkable than the mine was the city that had grown up around it. To accommodate the miners, ten-story apartment complexes were built up on the tiny rock - a high-rise maze linked together by courtyards, corridors, and stairs. There were schools, restaurants, and gaming houses, all encircled by the protective seawall. The island became known as “Midori nashi Shima,” the island without green. Amazingly, by the mid-1950s, it housed almost six thousand people, giving it the highest population density the world has ever known. And then the coal ran out. Mitsubishi closed the mine, everyone left, and this island city was abandoned, left to revert back to nature. The apartments began to crumble, and for the first time, in the barren courtyards, green things started to grow. Broken glass and old newspapers blew over the streets. The sea-breeze whistled through the windows. Now, fifty years later, the island is exactly as it was just after Mitsubishi left. A ghost town in the middle of the sea. From 1974 to 2009, the island was officially closed to all visitors, but recently the intriguing site has been re-opened to organized tours. The site was approved for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage list on July 5, 2015. The island is only accessible on organised tours. Nagasaki Municipal Government runs trips (ph: +81 095-829-1152), or cruises to the island are available from the Yamasa Kaiun maritime transport company (+81 095-822-5002).",ghost towns islands ruins

Also known as the Site of Reversible Destiny, it was conceived by New York-based artists/architects Arakawa and Gins in 1995. Visitors to the park, which sits in a town of only 33,000, are led through the many attractions by a series of guides who know how best to manipulate the surroundings. Attractions include the Critical Resemblance House; the Site of Reversible Destiny; and the Elliptical Field, which resembled a large, bowl-shaped basin. The Critical Resemblance House has a map of Gifu Prefecture as its roof and is filled with sets of furniture arranged in pairs on the floor, the ceiling, and even under the floor. The Elliptical Field is a series of nine pavilions joined by an intricate network of 148 paths. The park also includes golf courses, tennis courts, food courts, and a special area called Kid’s World. Constructed in October 1995, Yoro Park was designed to incorporate the 100 waterfalls in the immediate area, which are another popular draw for visitors. Update December 2019: The park is currently undergoing an extensive renovation to restore some of the attractions.

There are also the ancient treasures such as an octagonal lamp from the 700s, but the most surprising sight at the temple is the deer. Known as Sika Deer, they wander through the temples, sleep in corners, and generally stand around as tourists take their pictures. Once considered sacred messengers of the Shinto gods, and protected, they were later hunted to near extinction. Though they have been variously protected and hunted throughout their history in Japan, their population is strong today. Many are tame and established themselves in cities and touristy areas, eating from the hands of delighted visitors. They are even known to come up and bite visitors gently on the buttocks signaling that they desire crackers and they will steal bags from the unwitting. Despite having been damaged and destroyed multiple times due to fire, earthquakes, and accident (the Buddha’s head fell off in 855) both the buildings and the statues have been continually repaired. Today Tōdai-ji, or the Great Eastern Temple complex, and the Great Buddha Hall it contains are in excellent shape. The entryway to the temple is massive, with two towering guardians on each side protecting the great Buddha. The Buddha itself, the world’s largest statue of the Buddha Vairocana (or “Birushana” in Japanese) is seen as the universal aspect of the Buddha, a sort of all-in-one Buddha. The statue weighs some 500 tonnes and is a towering 49 feet tall, with a 17.5 foot-long face. His hair is made of 966 individual bronze balls. Creating this massive bronze Buddha occupied much of Japan’s bronze production during the 700s. Inside the giant temple there are numerous artifacts worth seeing beyond the Great Buddha. As Nara was once the capital of Japan, a lot of history sits in this place. Among the many things to see are miniature replicas of the temple and the grounds, various Buddhist statues, and the (somewhat unfair to the overweight) healing pillars, wooden columns with a hole in the bottom that bring good luck, or you allow you to reach enlightenment in your lifetime and some even say entrance to heaven, if you can squeeze through it.",giant buddhas monuments sacred spaces animals

Foxes are thought to be the messengers of Inari and as such many fox statues can be found at Inari shrines. The foxes are sometimes seen holding keys in their mouths, the key to the rice granaries. Japanese merchants, in particular, worship Inari to bring them wealth and leave numerous offerings at the shrines, particularly fried tofu called abuurage which is believed to be Inari’s favorite food. Fushimi Inari Shrine is also famous for its countless torii gates, offerings by worshippers, that cover the hiking trails of the wooded Mount Inari towering right behind the shrine. These torii gates envelope a path that winds over 2.5 miles up the Inari mountain. You’ll notice that on each torii there is kanji writing. On one side of the torii gates, you’ll see the name of the person or organization that donated it as well as the date that it was donated. The oldest gates there are said to be from the 8th century and new ones are being added frequently. It takes about two hours to walk along the whole trail. Film buffs might recognize this location because parts of the movie Memoirs of a Geisha were shot here. Along the hiking trail, there are several teahouses where you can rest like a pilgrim of bygone days. Once you’re back at the foot of Mount Inari around the entrance, you can also enjoy Kyoto-style Inari sushi—rice wrapped in aburaage—at one of the many establishments that have served food to the shrine-goers for centuries.

Originally established in 705 CE, the traditional “onsen” or “hot spring” was the brainchild of the son of the reigning emperor’s aid. The natural hot springs in the area allowed for the creation of a number of healing baths that drew visitors and military men from all around to come and relax. Among these early patrons were a number of samurai and famed shogun, giving the spa a bit more notoriety still. From its inception, the Keiunkan onsen has been passed down within the original family through the centuries. 52 different generations of descendants have cared for and operated the inn, growing the space and modernizing it slowly with each passing epoch. Today the site is considerably larger than it was over a thousand years ago, but both the look and feel of the inn have remained surprisingly unchanged. Despite modern amenities, the simple, calming design of the spaces and the natural mountains surrounding them make it feel as though it is still 705.

It was closed on August 31, however, such a sight could not remain hidden away for long. After attracting 4.5 million visitors in its first month on display, it popped up again the following year in Shizuoka, where Bandai manufactures its popular Gundam models. It was returned to Tokyo in 2011, displayed in fragments that visitors could pay a small fee to check out or take pictures with, to raise money following the tsunami that had devastated Japan. It is now back in all its glory, outside of a new theme park and museum of all things Gundam, called Gundam Base in the Diver City shopping center. The robot—which shoots smoke and lasers, can move its arms and head, and plays disco music—will be a number one draw on the sightseeing hitlist of visiting otaku, as anime-loving geeks are called here. The Gundam robot is large enough to be visible on the drive from Narita airport to downtown, as cars cross the Tokyo Bay-spanning Rainbow Bridge. The Gundam series itself remains a spectacular commentary on modern warfare, originating from a country that has seen the horrors of dramatic shifts in war technology first hand. The show’s criticisms of warfare seem even more true to life as the Gundam Robot takes its place along the real Tokyo skyline.

86,The Vine Bridges of Iya Valley,"Miyoshi, Japan","Hanging over one of Japan's ""hidden valleys,"" these vine bridges must be remade every three years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vine-bridges-japan,"One of Japan’s three “hidden” valleys, West Iya Valley is home to the kind of misty gorges, clear rivers, and thatch-roofed houses that one imagines from a Japan of 100 years ago. Remote and difficult to enter, the valley was a favored hideout of refugees, bandits, and disgraced warriors. To get across the Iya river that splits the rough valley terrain, these bandits, warriors, and locals created a very special, if unsteady, type of bridge — a vine bridge. No one is sure exactly who first created the vine bridges that reach across the Iya River (there were at least 13 at one point), although a couple of popular theories exist, both steeped in folklore. One tale says that the bridges were created by spiritual figure Kōbō-Daishi, the founder of Shingon Buddhism. Assumedly he came to the impromptu solution while traveling in the area and the idea caught on well enough to become a tradition. The other school of thought is that the bridges were originally the work of the legendary Heike refugees who would have built the bridges while fleeing from the Genji Clan, in search of a safe place to settle down. The idea was that the bridges could be easily cut down, turning the river valley into a naturally impassible barrier to their enemies. To create the bridges, two Wisteria vines — a particularly aggressive and tough vine that climbs around any host — were grown to extraordinary lengths from either side of the river. Once the vines had reached a sufficient length they were woven together and planking was woven into them at 8 to 12 inches apart. The bridge had no sides and a Japanese historical source relates that the original vine bridge was so unstable, that when those who were not used to it attempted to cross, the bridge would start to sway and bounce wildly causing the poor soul to freeze in place, unable to go any farther. No doubt this suited the reclusive residents of Iya Valley just fine. Local artisans have continued to keep the bridges alive, and while the number of bridges has dwindled to three, they are no less amazing. The largest and most accessible of the spans is the Iya Kazurabashi Bridge which reaches almost 150 feet across the valley at a height of almost 50 feet above the water. This more popular of the vine bridges is in West Iya, quite close to the main village, but the most beautiful vine bridges are a pair found in the east of the valley, known as the husband and wife bridges. Though stories range as to their origins, some believe they were built in the 1100s. While some (though apparently not all) of the bridges have been reinforced with wire and side rails, they are still harrowing to cross. 147 feet long, with planks set seven inches apart and a drop of four and a half stories to the water, they are not for those with a fear of heights. As one bridge crosser put it: “You never think a vine bridge is scary until you walk on one and shit a brick.” About a two-hour drive from Tokushima City, the bridges can still be crossed for 500 yen.",outsider architecture bridges
87,Yokai Street,"Kyoto, Japan",This neighborhood thoroughfare is haunted by dozens of homemade monsters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yokai-street,"Kyoto, Japan’s Ichijo-dori street is a fairly typical neighborhood street save for the dozens of monsters standing sentinel in front of most of the local businesses. Also known as Yokai (“monster”) Street, the tight commercial lane celebrates the often strange beings that populate local folklore. There is a wide range of yokai in Japanese legend ranging from good to mischievous to outright evil. Some are animals, some are human, and some are inanimate objects that have simply come to life. Many of the creatures come from children’s stories or teachable fables parents might tell their children so they would take care of their things and not be wasteful. For instance, treat the broom with respect or, when you break it, it will come alive and haunt you. Ichijo-dori street is home to around 30 of these outlandish creatures that have been created by the owners of the businesses they haunt. Some are fully sculpted statuettes while others are odd hodgepodges of clothing and toys. Despite what it might seem like, the street is not a typical tourist grab. It is populated by small local businesses catering to clientele in the neighborhood. There are no souvenir shops or anything of the sort, simply fun, quirky attempts to bring some attention to the neighborhood and breathe some life into aspects of all but forgotten Japanese folklore.  Standing at the south exit of the shrine on Imadegawa dori you will see a street just east that leads south. Walk south a couple of minutes until you hit a small huddle of shops.

There are over thousands of maneki-neko cats, from big to small. Locals and tourists alike put new maneki-neko cats every day, so the number is constantly increasing. Legend has it that during the Edo period, the final era of traditional Japanese government, a cat under the care of a priest at Gotokuji Temple led a feudal lord to safety during a thunderstorm. The cat beckoned the lord and his servants inside with a waving gesture—hence all maneki-neko statues have one paw raised. The lord enjoyed tea with the priest while the thunderstorm raged outside. To express his thanks afterward, he donated rice and land and selected Gotokuji Temple as the cemetery for his prestigious family. Today, visitors can see hundreds of lucky cat figures on display around a statue of the goddess of mercy, Kannon. The main building and grounds are dotted with cats, while cat-related art lines the streets surrounding the temple.  Gotokuji is easily accessible from central Tokyo. From Shinjuku station, take the Odakyu line in the direction of Hon-Atsugi directly to Gotokuji station. It takes around 30 minutes.

He first emerged from his atom bomb disturbed slumber in 1954, and 29 films later—despite his senior status—he’s still “King of the Monsters.” No place knows this better than Godzilla’s hometown of Tokyo, where a giant head of the scaly menace has been seen towering over the Toho Building in the Shinjuku Ward. Toho is the Japanese studio behind the Godzilla franchise, and they added their trademark character to help publicize their Shinjuku movie theater complex. The building also houses Hotel Gracery, a a 970-bed hotel which opened in 2015 and features Godzilla-themed rooms. The head harkens back to the classic Godzilla, instead of the more lateral and lizardly look he took on in the 1998 version. He evokes the beloved and cuddly “guy in a rubber suit” look, with some added light-up eyes and glowing claws. And every few minutes he lets out his signature screechy roar, a little bit car crash, and a little bit nails-on-chalkboard. The Godzilla head is 40 feet tall, which is life-size if you consider that the original monster topped out at 165 feet–about a 16-story building. He can’t quite stomp on his Toho creators downstairs, but he can still give them a good scare. The Godzilla head is located atop the Toho building Tokyo's Shinjuku ward.

Set at the foot of lush green mountains, the spa/theme park in Japan’s Hakone prefecture offers all of the refreshing spa treatments one might expect from such a relaxation palace, but its theme baths are like nothing else in the world. The complex offers a number of theme spas such as the Roman-styled Ancient Roman Bath or the massive God’s Aegean Sea. However its the drink-themed attractions like the Green Tea Spa, where bathers get to relax in a pool filled with actual tea, that steal the show. In addition to the relaxing tea bath, the site also has a Red Wine Spa, a Japanese Sake Spa, a Coffee Spa, and a pepper-water filled Ramen Noodle Spa. More than just colored water, these pools are filled with the actual drink. The coffee is brewed in pots and poured into the pool barrel-by-barrel, and the sake and wine baths could even get someone drunk (although drinking any of these waters is highly inadvisable). Don’t miss the coffee- and wine-pouring ceremonies, which occur several times each day at hours posted near the pools themselves.  Be warned, however, that much like a Nickelodeon gameshow, more juice ends up on the spectators than in the spa. Each themed bath also features over-sized drink containers associated with the bath. For instance, the wine bath issues from a giant wine bottle, and massive fake noodles hang over the ramen pool.

Pigment is dry concentrated color dust used to give fabric, ink, plastics, and, of course, paint their hue. By adding a binding agent like oil or glue to the powder, the pigment becomes adhesive. It’s an older style of paint-making as opposed to purchasing paint pre-mixed, but many artists prefer it for its simplicity and versatility. The store also sells other traditional Japanese painting supplies like brushes, papers, frames, natural animal glue, and ink stones. Pigment the store is just as beautiful as its contents. It was designed by renowned architect Kengo Kuma, whose work connects ancient principles of Japanese art and ideology to the modern day.

The story of the 47 Ronin (historically known as “The Ako Incident,” and known in fiction as the “Chushingura”) is held as an exemplar of the Bushido honor code associated not just with historic samurai, but which is also part of the national identity. The story tells of Asano Naganori, a feudal lord in 18th century Japan, who was forced to commit ritual suicide (seppuku) after he attacked Kira Yoshinaka, a high-ranking master of ceremonies. Naganori’s death left the samurai under his auspice without a master, and 47 of them felt honor-bound to take revenge. Newly ronin-ized, the 47 warriors disappeared into lives of drunkenness and vice for over a year, although according to the legend, this was all part of the plan. In December of 1703, the 47 Ronin pulled themselves out of their seeming stupor, and launched a surprise attack on Yoshinaka’s castle. They successfully killed Yoshinaka, avenging their master. However true to their code they then turned themselves into the authorities, who then asked each of them to commit seppuku. The 47 Ronin took their own lives, upholding the sacred Bushido code. Based on actual events, the story has become so ingrained as a national legend that exact fact and fiction are not immediately easy to separate. Nonetheless, Naganori and his 47 Loyal Retainers, or the men the legend is based on, are buried at the 17th century Buddhist temple, Sengaku-Ji.

If you ever go exploring, you may just fall into one. One of the largest and most impressive of these lava caves is the Narusawa Hyoketsu. Stairs lead down into the 70-foot-deep cavern and areas where you must crouch to get through. Once you reach the bottom, the ice is crystal clear and stunning, catching the color-changing light beautifully. Narusawa Hyoketsu formed as a result of a massive eruption of Mount Fuji in the year 864. Lava flowed through a channel beneath the hardened surface, leaving behind this 156-meter (512-foot) underground tunnel. The average temperature of the cave is around zero degrees Celsius. As water drips through the rock, it freezes into long, spindly icicles as well as larger pillars of ice, some of which stand around 30 meters (100 feet) tall. The ice is there year-round, though it is larger in the winter, when icicles can reach up to three feet long.  Located on the edge of the Aokigahara, also known as the “Sea of Trees,” Narusawa Hyoketsu is designated a Natural Monument of Japan.  Very easy to reach using the ""sightseeing buses"". Maps and affordable bus passes are available at Kawaguchiko station. Discounted entrance fee if you've purchased a bus pass (instead of paying for each ride separately).

This area, known as Omoide Yokocho (“Memory Lane”), started out as a black market in the late 1940s after World War II. The strip was also known for cheap drinks and grilled skewers of yakitori. The area’s many watering holes and lack of public restrooms earned it the nickname “piss alley,” as inebriated patrons would relieve themselves in the street. Although the alley was partly razed to make room for the new Shinjuku station and partly destroyed in a fire in the 1990s, a sizable chunk has survived. The local government also rebuilt the fire-damaged sections, making sure to restore their original Shōwa-era appearance.  Today, Omoide Yokocho is filled with tiny stalls serving yakitori and nikomi (a type of beef tendon stew) meant to be washed down with plenty of cheap beer and sake. One of the most famous, or infamous, of them is suggestively named Asadachi, which means “morning wood.” This bar is known for offering such delicacies as fried frogs, salamanders, and aphrodisiacs such as bull penises to go with your beer. Despite its past, the area is now perfectly safe to visit. Most establishments even offer menus in English. To experience Omoide Yokocho in its full glory, it is recommended to visit at nighttime, when most of the tiny bars are open, the lights are illuminated, and the area is filled with businessmen and tourists alike looking for a quick snack and a good drink.

After the disaster locals began reconstruction with a shrine to a fire protection deity, Akiba. As Tokyo expanded the neighborhood developed, and took the name of the shrine that protected it. Following World War II, as Japan became more future-focused, Akihabara became known as the place to buy electronic goods of all kinds: radios, television sets, household appliances, many of them sold illegally. Tokyoites knew to head to “Akihabara Electric Town” for all the latest contraptions on the market. Naturally, when home computers entered the global marketplace, Akihabara was the place to buy them. In the 1980s, paso-kons, personal computers, were a niche hobby. The evolution of the internet over the decades to come meant that otakus (the obsessive fans that have unified into a proud subculture) could create and share at an ever-increasing rate. The neighborhood’s wares changed to suit this cultural explosion. Though Akihabara is still the place to go for computers, cell phones, cameras, video games, and other electronic goods, the visual landscape has been dominated by anime and manga aesthetic. In recent years Akihabara Electric Town has only become more of a consumer’s paradise. On Sundays the central Chuo-dori street is blocked off to vehicles. Shoppers flood the streets, crowding into big department stores like Mandarake and Don Quijote as well as tiny independent stalls. In particular, it has become a popular place for teenagers to congregate, especially those visiting from outside Tokyo. Cute, colorful wares are for sale, and cosplayers are everywhere. The popular girl band AKB48, which takes its name from the neighborhood, even runs a restaurant in Akihabara.

Make the right choice and find yourself inside the first of the shop’s themed floors, the White room. The White room offers food and drinks, from tea to the mysterious “Drink Me” bottles from the story. The second floor, the Queen of Hearts room, is dedicated to accessories, and is the spot where you can pick up your very own version of the white rabbit’s pocket watch. The third floor, the Mad Hatter room, sells Alice-themed clothing and merchandise. The shop is decorated with art reminiscent of both the books and Disney’s adaptations, strongly influenced by the 2010 live action film by Tim Burton. There are key-holes to peep through to find hidden tableaux, a picture of the Cheshire Cat whose eyes follow your movement, and the Queen of Hearts’ throne that screams “Off with her head!” from time to time. Many of the shop’s accessories also feature Sir John Tenniel’s original book illustrations. The store’s name is obviously a nod to Carroll’s iconic character, but what about the second part?

A UNESCO World Heritage site, it is dedicated to the three daughters of the Shinto deity of seas and storms, and is built on piers over the water of the Seto Sea because the island was originally thought to be too sacred for commoners to tread upon. The sixteen-meter high camphor wood o-torii that stands in the water in front of the shrine, rebuilt most recently in 1875, is one of the most famous sights in Japan.

The present structure dates to the mid-16th century but follows a design completed in 1168 and funded by warlord Taira no Kiyomori. A five-story pagoda next to the shrine, called Goju no to, was built in 1407 and serves as a Buddhist temple dedicated to Benzaiten, the goddess of eloquence, music, and wealth. Because Itsukushima is considered sacred ground, no hospitals or cemeteries are allowed on the island.

The island was chosen for its secrecy and isolation and was even removed from some maps. After the war, the poison was disposed of and the laboratory animals were set loose. With no natural predators native to the island, they quickly spread and now there are hundreds of tame rabbits roaming around.  However, others assert that these are not the testing bunnies, but rabbits that were released just for the new park that developed on the island. In 1988, the two room gas plant was converted into the Poison Gas Museum and opened to educate the Japanese people about the role the island played during the Second World War.

A typhoon decimated the original eighth-century temple in the 1950s, destroying parts of the structure. It was then decided that the temple would be rebuilt in a different, safer location. Rather than abandon all hope for the ancient temple, one of its priests began rebuilding it piece by piece atop its new patch of land. He did more than just reconstruct the building. As he worked, also added Buddhist stone carvings to the property. He also taught the town people how to create the carvings, so their work is now mixed in with his own.

While Ryoan-ji (The Temple of the Dragon at Peace) is actually the name of the entire temple complex which surrounds the almost 3,000 square foot rock garden, or kare-sansui in Japanese, the name is now synonymous with the serene stone scene. Constructed around the year 1500 either by professional gardeners or monks, the meditative scene contains 15 small boulders resting in a bed of white gravel which is raked into perfect lines each day by the current monks in the temple. It is said that the garden is setup so that visitors can only see 14 of the boulders at one time, but upon enlightenment, they will be able to see fifteen. The garden is surrounded by a wall made of clay boiled in oil that has taken on a rich, woody color from its years at the temple. There are no plants in the garden save for the moss that grows on the stationary boulders. While the large boulders in the garden appear to have been placed at random, scholars both philosophical and scientific have attempted to divine the meeting of the space. While some say that the rocks are placed in such a way as to draw attention to the architectural flourishes of the building, or that their placement hides some underlying message, most guests agree that so long as you can find personal meaning in the quiet natural order of the garden, you have found the meaning of Ryoan-ji.",temples gardens rocks plants geology
104,Blue Pond,"Hokkaidō, Japan",This mesmerizingly colorful pond looks like a scene straight out of a fairytale.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-pond,"A quick walk through the forest near Biei, Japan, leads to a mesmerizing scene straight out of a fairytale. There, a brilliant blue pond lies tucked away within the woods. Dead silver birch trees poke above the water’s edge, their reflections seemingly painted on a glassy canvas. The artificial pond was created in 1988 when the Biei River was dammed to prevent damage from mudflows from the eruption of nearby Mount Tokachi. What was supposed to be just an effect of an environmental engineering project created a breathtakingly beautiful human-made wonder. The pond’s cerulean hue is thought to be caused by aluminum hydroxide suspended in the water. Aluminium hydroxide reflects shorter-wavelength blue light, meaning that the water itself isn’t actually blue. But that doesn’t make it any less captivating. The enchanting color changes depending on the angle from which you view it, the time of day, and the season. When the air is still, it reflects the trees submerged within their watery grave like a blue-tinted mirror. Though the pond freezes over during the colder months, there’s now an annual tradition of illuminating the water each season, creating an ethereal glow beneath the blanket of snow and ice. If the pond looks at all familiar, there’s a good reason why. It gained international recognition after Apple included an image of it as a wallpaper in OS X Mountain Lion, which was released in 2012.  The pond is accessible by vehicle or by bus tour from Sapporo. From the parking lot, it is a five-to-10-minute walk through the forest to the pond.

Set on just under nine acres, the gardens were designed in the style of the Edo Period, the period of Japanese History from 1603-1868, when shoguns ruled Japan (also known as the Tokugawa shogunate). Professor Makoto Nakamura of Kyoto University designed the gardens so that, which each turn down one of the many paths, the view changes and it appears one has entered another garden entirely. As such, the gardens are themed – the garden of the lord’s residence, complete with requisite bridges, waterfall and koi pond, a tea garden, where a formal tea ceremony can be enjoyed for an additional fee, a pine tree garden, a bamboo garden, a flower garden, etc. While the gardens are beautiful in any season, if you can arrange your schedule with a bit of spontaneity, go to Japan during cherry blossom season (any time from March to May, depending). It’s hard to predict, but an entire nation celebrating new life in the form of perfectly delicate flowers on previously barren trees is a once in a lifetime experience not to be missed.  To gain access to this garden, you may add an extra fee to the Himeji Castle ticket or buy a separate ticket only for it.",optical oddities horticulture plants

Unlike those in most seafood restaurants, the aquariums in Zauo are not just for show. When you enter Zauo, you’re given a fishing rod and some bait, and are told to catch your own dinner. You sit on a giant boat, surrounded by an equally impressive aquarium full of fish. The aquarium is full of a variety of pescaterian delights ranging from red snapper, to mackerel, to sharks. If it’s in the aquarium, it’s fair game for you to catch. Whether or not you can catch the more delectable fish depends more on luck than skill. When you eat depends on how well you fish, and how you want your fish prepared. You can get your fish grilled, fried, steamed, and boiled, but the freshest option is to have your fish raw, sashimi style.",Unique Restaurants & Bars
107,Sōgenji Temple (Kappa-Dera),"Tokyo, Japan","Shrine to Japanese water-goblins, complete with their preserved body parts.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sougenji-kappa-dera-temple,"In Japanese folklore, the kappa is a bipedal, turtle-like aquatic goblins who sometimes grabs unsuspecting humans, often children, as they walk over bridges or through swamps, pulling them down into the muck to drown them. The fishy-smelling kappa’s most distinct feature is the bowl-like dent on the top of its head, which it must keep filled with water at all times to stay alive. There is also a curious myth about a fictitious, mysterious organ called shirikodama (“anus ball”), for which the creature reportedly kills its victims for. The Tokyo neighborhood of Kappabashi adopts the kappa as its mascot, even though the “kappa” in its name simply comes from a homophonous word meaning “raincoat,” deriving from Portuguese capa. In this case, it comes from the name of a local merchant, Kappaya (“raincoat-seller”) Kihachi, who funded the construction of a canal to prevent flood damages. During the canal’s construction, it is said that the kappa came from the nearby Sumida River and helped Kihachi. When he died in 1814 he was buried at Sōgen-ji, a 17th-century temple that eventually became known as the Kappa-dera (“kappa temple”). Today, the temple still stands there and its altar is kept piled high with offerings of cucumbers - said to be the kappa’s favorite food - and its treasure chamber contains antique scroll-drawings of the goblins and even the mummified arm of a kappa. Visitors should keep an eye out for the numerous statues of kappa that stand outside local shops in the area. Some of these are cute and cuddly, but others are decidedly creepy. If you ever encounter a real kappa, remember that some kappa are good-natured, like the others who helped Kihachi, and some are mischievous and harmless, though there are murderous ones, too. The kappa often challenges children to a sumo match, and even though it’s incredibly strong (and will eat your internal organs if you lose), there is a chance to win: bow to it as the match begins, and it will oblige the creature to bow in return, emptying its head-bowl and losing its strength.  The kappa temple is just west of the Asakusa district, and a five-minute taxi-ride, or 15-minute walk, from Ueno JR station on the Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines. It is also a 10-minute walk from the Iriya (Hibiya line) and Inaricho (Ginza line) Tokyo Metro stations, and a 7-minute walk from the Asakusa station of the Tsukuba Express line.",severed limbs cryptozoology wonder cabinets monsters shrines

Every day for a year, the golden Akita, dubbed Hachikō, would accompany his owner to Shibuya Station, and every day he would be waiting for the professor to return for the walk home. One sad day, the train came, but Professor Ueno didn’t appear. Hachikō returned the next day, and the next, but there was no way to tell the poor dog what had become of his master. The Professor had died of a stroke and would never step off of the train to greet him again. For nine years, Hachikō waited for the train every day, only to leave alone. Commuters and station employees would feed him treats and keep him company, and an old student of the professor retraced the dog’s genealogy, declaring Hachikō as one of only 30 purebred Akitas remaining in the world. He became quite the celebrity over the years, inspiring books, films, art, and poetry, and was present at the unveiling of his own bronze statue, a version of which still remains at Shibuya Station as a popular meeting spot. When Hachikō died of a combination of cancer and worms in the streets of Shibuya in 1935, his remains were stuffed and mounted, and can now be visited at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo. Flanking taxidermized Hachikō are Jirō, one of two Sakhalin Huskies famous for surviving a year in Antarctica after being abandoned during a failed scientific expedition to the South Pole, and Kai Ken (a.k.a. “Tora Inu” or “Tiger Dog”), a rare breed of dog considered to be the most ancient and purest dog breed in Japan. Hachikō is placed low in the display case representing his true height. This placement invites the viewer to kneel just as you would to pet a live dog. It also places him eye to eye with the children who gleefully rush toward him shouting, “Hachikō! Hachikō!” when they spy him from around the corner. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Hachikō.

Tenryū-ji — more formally known as Tenryū Shiseizen-ji — is the head temple of the Tenryū branch of Rinzai Zen Buddhism. Founded by Ashikaga Takauji in 1339 and originally headed by Musō Soseki, the temple was built primarily to venerate Gautama Buddha. While the rest of the temple was rebuilt after burning down, the zen garden has survived, uninterrupted, since its planting. As a temple related to both the Ashikaga family and Emperor Go-Daigo, the temple is held in high esteem, and is ranked number one among Kyoto’s so-called Five Mountains, or Kyoto Gozan. In 1994, it was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the “Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto”. The bamboo trail can be accessed via the North Gate.  You can arrive at Tenryu-ji by city bus or by JR train from Kyoto station to Saga Arashiyama station (嵯峨嵐山駅). take the south exit and walk down the street for about 200 meters (220 yards), then make a right turn just before you get to the train tracks (different line). You will walk straight into Tenryu-ji after 350 meters (380 yards). Despite its supposed name, the bamboo trail is located outside the grounds of Tenryu-ji Temple.

The complex has been designated as a natural monument by the Japanese government since 1934, thanks not only to its remarkable size and enchanting aquatic features, but also because of the unique varieties of bats that call the cave home. Surveys of Ryūsendō Cave began in 1920, and thus far, some 3600m (about 2 miles) have been explored and mapped, of which 700m (a half mile) can be visited by the public. Exploration is ongoing, however, and it is believed that the full extent of the cave is likely 5000m (3 miles) or more. Additionally, eight underground lakes have been found in Ryūsendō, fed by underground river of crystal-clear spring water constantly gushing forth from the bedrock. Three of these lakes are accessible to visitors and feature submerged lighting that illuminates that chambers with the brilliant blues and greens of the limestone-filtered waters—colors pleasingly saturated thanks to the clarity and depth of the waters. A fourth lake that is not included in the tour reaches an impressive depth of 120m (almost 400 feet), making it the deepest underground lake in Japan as well as one of the most transparent lakes in the world. Elevated walkways, bridges, and stairs conduct visitors through a 30-minute tour that ranges from the water’s surface to the cavern roof, where those intrepid enough can view the watery depths from amidst stalactites high above. While up there, one might even come face-to-face with some of the rare bats that populate the cave, including Brown long-eared bats, Eastern long-fingered bats, Hilgendorf’s tube-nosed bats, and Greater horseshoe bats.

A silent escort dressed head to toe in black will lead you through a series of winding corridors, a drawbridge, and secret doorways into the hidden dining room. This is Ninja Akasaka, where diners can step four centuries into the past as black-clad mercenaries serve up dinner and a show. The atmosphere is decked out in stone and wood, Edo period style, when Japan operated under a feudal system and ninjas were spy warriors available for hire. Though there is little historical evidence to flesh out our knowledge of ninjas, they have become a folklore fascination the world over, so needless to say Ninja Akasaka does well. Patrons order their food off of lengthy scrolls, after which the ninja waitstaff fade into the darkness. They’re not gone for long though—they will periodically reappear, seemingly out of thin air, to entertain the table with sword tricks and martial arts demonstrations. The food is modern Japanese cuisine, but each course is served with dramatic ninja flair. Black sesame crackers are shaped like throwing stars. Escargot “bombs” are lit on fire by a fuse of gunpowder. Snow crab is served atop a grapefruit pierced by a sword, which, when removed, releases smoky vapor from the dry ice inside.",ninjas restaurants shops food

If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to see those lovely tranquil scenes through Monet’s eyes, this small pond in Japan’s Gifu Prefecture is about as close as you can get. The coloration of the aptly nicknamed Monet’s Pond is so profound you’d think there must be some artificial lighting or dye at play. The neon-looking plants are insanely vibrant, the water is crystal clear and shimmering, and the water lilies and bright koi contrast spectacularly with the dark pond beneath them. But amazingly, there are no visual effects whatsoever. Monet’s Pond is naturally just that beautiful. Located in Seki city, the small body of water, just 60 feet long, remarkably resembles the pond in the French painter’s famous Water Lilies series, which actually depicts the Japanese garden at his home in Giverny, France. The pond can be found via a short path that circles the pond.

113,Sokushinbutsu of Dainichibou Temple,"Tsuruoka, Japan",The self-mummified monks of Japan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sokushinbutsu-dainichi-temple,"Scattered throughout northern Japan are over two dozen mummified Japanese monks known as sokushinbutsu. Followers of shugendō, an ancient form of Buddhism, the monks died in the ultimate act of self-denial. For three years, the priests would eat a special diet consisting only of nuts and seeds, while taking part in a regimen of rigorous physical activity that stripped them of their body fat. They then ate only bark and roots for another three years and began drinking a poisonous tea made from the sap of the urushi tree, normally used to lacquer bowls. This caused vomiting and a rapid loss of bodily fluids, and—most importantly—it killed off any maggots that might cause the body to decay after death. Finally, a self-mummifying monk would lock himself in a stone tomb barely larger than his body, wherein he would not move from the lotus position. His only connection to the outside world was an air tube and a bell. Each day, he rang a bell to let those outside know that he was still alive. When the bell stopped ringing, the tube was removed and the tomb sealed. Not all monks who attempted self-mummification were successful. When the tombs were finally opened, some bodies were found to have rotted. These monks were resealed in their tombs. They were respected for their endurance, but they were not worshiped. Those monks who had succeeded in mummifying themselves were raised to the status of Buddha, put on display, and tended to by their followers. The Japanese government outlawed sokushinbutsu in the late 19th century, though the practice apparently continued into the 20th. Although roughly 28 of these sokushinbutsu remain, only 16 of them can be visited. The most famous is Shinnyokai Shonin of the Dainichibou Temple on the holy Mount Yudono. The majority of the monks who underwent self-mummification did so near this temple. It has been shown that a local spring had high levels of arsenic, and this may have helped the monks in the mummification process. Others can be found in more banal locations such as in Nangakuji Temple, in the suburbs of Tsuruoka, and at Kaikokuji Temple in the small city of Sakata.",self mummified relics and reliquaries mummies rites and rituals temples

Hidden on the fifth floor of an unassuming office building in the middle of a busy Shinjuku Sanchome street, this small bar is packed with various games and gaming accessories from Mario figurines to Power Gloves to Nintendo’s 3-D gaming system and even Virtual Boy. So-called in reference to consoles’ 8-bit processors, the 8-bit era of gaming began in 1983 with the release of Famicom (short for “Family Computer”) in Japan. In other parts of the world, this pivotal gaming system would be known by another name: the Nintendo Entertainment System. Shortly thereafter, games such as Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, and The Legend of Zelda became household names around the world. It’s no surprise that Japan, a powerhouse of the video game industry, especially during the early ’80s, would have establishments celebrating this history. In fact, the country as a whole and Tokyo in particular have a plethora of video game–themed establishments, but not many quite like the 8bit Cafe. Not only can you peruse various memorabilia, you can also pick any of the games from the shelves and play them while sipping on a drink themed after your favorite video game character.  Take the C5 exit from the Shinjuku Sanchome station, the bar is on the fifth floor of the building to your right. Open from 6pm to midnight on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays.

The most curious part of the development, however, is not its flashy design or luxury buildings, but the small garden that separates the office and cinema complex from a local TV studio. Here, amid sunbathing office workers and locals eating lunch, sits a quiet pond ringed by reeds and irises. The pond itself dates back to the late 18th century, but that’s not all. It is filled with tiny silvery fish — fish from beyond this world. The pond’s medaka — a species of small freshwater fish (Oryzias latipes ) once common in flooded Japanese rice paddies, but highly susceptible to pesticides and fertilizer run-off — are descendants of those bred aboard the 1994 Columbia space shuttle. The fish were bred as part of a series of experiments in extraterrestrial reproduction, and their descendants on earth continue to be studied by scientists. A small sign asks people not to dump unwanted goldfish or other pets into the pond, in case they eat the precious space-fish descendants.

This historic village is the best place in Japan to see the distinct gassho-zukuri style farmhouses with their unique, traditional architecture. The defining feature of these wooden homes is the thatched triangular roofs, designed to withstand heavy snow in wintertime. The shape of the roofs resemble monk’s hands in prayer, which is where the gassho-zukuri (meaning “the act of prayer”) houses get their name. Some houses were built over 300 years ago and are still lived in by local residents, while others were converted into tourist shops. Shirakawa-gō is especially popular during the winter as the piles of snow on the thatched farmhouses are an impressive sight. On special weekends in January and February, the homes are illuminated. Whether it is cherry blossoms in spring, the bright leaves in fall, or the vibrant green of the surrounding rice fields in summer, the natural landscape offers the perfect backdrop for the unique houses year-round.  Shirakawago is located on the west coast of Honshu along the Shokawa River near Kanazawa and Takayama. Bus tickets are just under 2000 yen one-way from Kanazawa that can be reached via the Hokuriku Shinkansen.

Cherry blossoms bloom throughout the garden in the spring (there are 500 cherry trees) and hydrangea in the summer (the garden contains 180 varieties). Maple trees flash their crimson leaves in the fall, and in the winter the conservatory keeps its tropical plants, orchids, and succulents warm. Founded in 1924, the nearly 60-acre Kyoto Botanical Garden nurtures some 120,000 plants on its grounds. After falling into disuse in 1945, it reopened in 1961 and today is Japan’s oldest and most comprehensive botanical garden. The conservatory isn’t just a nice spot to keep warm on a winter garden tour; at nearly 50,000 square feet (4,612 square meters) it is one of Japan’s largest conservatories as well. The garden also has a children’s play area, a flower stand where you can purchase your own piece of plant life, and a small cafe. The gardens provide a space to escape to from the hustle of Kyoto’s busy attractions, to find solitude, or to simply appreciate the beauty of plants.

According to the story, the mermaid first appeared to Prince Shotoku at Lake Biwa. With its last breaths, it told a story of woe: the miserable creature had been a fisherman who trespassed to fish in protected waters, and was now transformed into a hideous beast as punishment. Having learned his lesson, and wanting to be an example after his death, the mermaid asked the prince to found a temple to display his horrible, mummified remains as a very strange object lesson in the sanctity of life. Notably different from Western ideas of beautiful mermaids luring sailors into the watery depths with their charms, the Japanese mermaid of lore, known as the “ningyo,” was often depicted as a pointy-toothed little monster, sometimes even sporting claws or horns. Despite this particular creature’s allegedly long history, it is difficult to overlook its similarities to the sideshow gaffs which became enormously popular after being first displayed by the infamous PT Barnum — gaffs which were known to often have been manufactured in Japan. Ancient or merely old, the mermaid is cared for by the Shinto order at Fujinomiya, near Mount Fuji.  Nearest city is Fujinomiya. No public transportation goes to the temple.

With a series of five wooden arches, the bridge spans the Nishiki River. It is located at the foot of Mt. Yokotama, which is topped with the famous Iwakuni Castle. The castle was built in 1601 and overlooked a series of wooden bridges, all destroyed by spring floods before the Kintai bridge was completed. The elegance of the bridge’s form inspired the name Kintai, which means gold brocade sash because of a similarity to the traditional Nishiki obi for a kimono. It has been rebuilt several times since it was initially constructed even though it was thought to be indestructible, most recently in 1951 after a typhoon. The bridge is made up of five arches standing atop four stone piers as well as two wood piers that sit on the dry riverbed where the bridge begins and ends. For almost three hundred years, the bridge stood without the use of nails that you would find in more traditional construction. It stood because all of its many pieces were very carefully fitted together. Sheets of copper were laid over the main wooden parts of the bridge after it was built. Kintai remains Japan’s most famous bridge. Tourists cross it on foot to visit samurai family-owned houses in Kikko Park, and take a cable car to the heights to visit Iwakuni Castle, and to see a breathtaking panorama of Iwakuni and the Seto Sea. Declared a National Treasure in 1922, the area including both the bridge and the castle is one of the country’s most popular destinations, especially during the Cherry Blossom festival in the spring.

Chinoike Jigoku diverges from the pack in its composition, appearance, and history. Only a small pool, its name is translated to Bloody Hell Pond, and its appearance immediately matches the images conjured by its name alone. At 78 degrees Celsius, Bloody Hell Pond could better be used for cooking than a spa treatment. Its boiling waters bubble and send steam wafting off its surface into the air. Besides its outrageous temperature, Chinoike Jigoku is also rich in iron oxide at the base of the pond, which gives the pool a deep reddish color. Since 700 C.E. sources have mentioned the pond and its appearance, which according to Buddhist beliefs, resembled a nightmarish underworld. It doesn’t help that the pool’s original uses were just as hellish as its dark, red, boiling mud. Chinoike Jigoku was used to torture people, and then boil them to death.

Once a massive craze back in the 1920’s, the term now refers to a retro, European-influenced type of cafe that has a nostalgic ambience of the Shōwa era (1926-1989). Many continue to exist in a past era that doesn’t recognize wi-fi, alternative milks, or to-go orders. Located in the ever-popular Ueno district, Kojo (officially stylized Kojyo) may be the most ostentatious of such specialty cafes, being an archetype of so-called shiro-kei or “castle-type” kissaten. Such type of cafe is characterized by ornate, sparkling lighting fixtures, European art, and classical music, and Kojo fully lives up to its name, which literally means “old castle.” Inside, you’ll find a large Yamaha Electone organ, a Tutankhamun mask, crystal chandeliers, and a massive, Art Deco-style stained glass window. Huge slabs of rock and fake plants divvy up the room, giving Kojo the feel of, to quote a reviewer on Japan Travel, “a mixture between a mountain cave and a southern European church.” Today, these stylized throwbacks stand in contrast to the country’s recent influx of third-wave coffeeshops (many of the Starbucks variety). After hopping off the train at Ueno, wander into this portal to an antiquated Euro-dream, pondering bygone design infatuations over a Vienna coffee or the cafe’s signature milkshake.  The fastest way to get here from Ueno Station, if you've taken a Tokyo Metro subway, is to start from Exit 1 and walk for a couple minutes.

Ken-kun, a Shiba Inu, rocketed to global fame following a viral tweet early in 2019, and the internet was delighted at what a good boy he was. While Ken-kun can’t actually roast the sweet potatoes or handle the money—that lack of opposable thumbs can really hold an entrepreneur back—he does man the stand solo for most of the day. His owner roasts the potatoes and leaves them in a plastic container, then comes around several times a day to count the cash in an honor-system money box and walk Ken-kun. But for the most part, the dog is an independent go-getter. Ken-kun enjoys the enviable status of the only known dog currently manning a Japanese food stand, but he’s not the only Shiba Inu who’s been in on the hustle. That honor also goes to the businesslike assistant shopkeeper at Tokyo’s Suzuki tobacco stand, who retired after three years on the job. Ken-kun, however, gets the award for selling a decidedly more nutritious product, and for inspiring honesty in the hearts of visitors to the honor-system stand through his wholesome presence alone. Update as of June 2021: Ken-kun has sadly passed away.   Ken-kun's stand can be difficult to find. While public transport is an option, the most straightforward way may be by car. Come early: The shop closes at 3:00 p.m. and potatoes have been known to sell out by early afternoon. The foil-wrapped potatoes are kept in a plastic container. Simply grab one and leave 200 yen (about $2) in the cash box.",potatoes street food dogs roadside attractions animals

Atami also claims one of Japan’s best ‘Hihokan’, the euphemistic expression used for sex museums meaning “House of Hidden Treasures”. With three levels of exhibits covering a multitude of positions on Japanese sexuality, this cliffside collection is a popular stop that gives visitors a sexy, silly, and sometimes just weird experience into Japanese sex culture. Arriving by cable car, guests can marvel at the amazing view from the cliffs before delving into the museum which contains an array of enticing displays, including traditional Japanese sex artwork, holograms, figurines depicting fetishes such as Hentai and bondage, and abstract nude mannequin art. On the sillier side, which will provide awkward conversation but also makes it less creepy to be in a sex museum with your friends or family, are the more interactive displays. A carnival-like shooting game that blows up a Can-Can dancers dress when the bullseye is hit, a wind machine that when cranked, blows a life-sized Marilyn Monroe’s dress up ala “The Seven Year Itch”, and a giant penis ride you can climb on for a mere 100Yen. Despite the naughty theme, this museum is enjoyed by young and old, as long as the young are over 18. You must be at least as tall as the whale penis replica to enjoy this collection, or have valid I.D. It is is accessible by road and also the Atami Ropeway.

The ground floor might seem harmless enough - lights flash on oversize maps of Japan to show where different parasites are present, and displays feature parasites that infect animals- but go up the stairs and things take an even more gruesome turn. The second floor focuses on parasites that infect humans. Photographs show the severely distended testicles of the unfortunate human host of a tropical bug. Nearby, a giant herpetological parasite pokes out of a bottled turtle’s head. The museum has over 45,000 immersed and prepared parasite specimens in its collection. But the prize attraction is undoubtedly the world’s longest tapeworm - all 8.8 metres of it - accompanied by a rope the same length that you can “play with” to get a real “feel” for its dimensions. The small gift shop sells a cheery range of parasite-themed T-shirts, keyrings, and birthday cards.  Fifteen minute walk from JR Meguro station (a map is available from their website).

The enormous bronze statue is a representation of Amida Buddha, located on the grounds of the Kotoku-in (高徳院) temple in Kamakura City. The monument dates all the way back to 1252, though the identity of the original sculptor is not known today. It’s thought to have been cast in bronze collected from melted Chinese coins, and originally plated with gold. Only traces of gold leaf remain on the statue’s right cheek, as it has stood in the open air since the temple building was destroyed in the tsunami of September 20, 1492. The Daibutsu of Kamakura is the second largest monumental Buddha in Japan (only the Nara Daibutsu is taller), weighing approximately 121 tons and reaching a height of 13.35 meters. For a small donation of 20 yen, visitors can actually go inside the sacred monument and see how it was cast from the inside.

128,Kan'ei-ji Temple,"Tokyo, Japan",A Buddhist temple to honor insects that died for science.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kan-eiji-temple,"Close to Tokyo’s Ueno Park, the Kan’ei-ji temple is a quiet pagoda far removed from the hustle and bustle of the park’s top tourists draws, its zoo and museums. Few visitors stop by, and most of those who do come for its historical significance: It was here in 1869 that supporters of the Emperor attacked the forces of the last Tokugawa shogun. It’s said there are still bullet holes in the temple’s wooden walls. But, even more remarkably, the temple is home to a simple engraved stone — a memorial to the souls of dead insects. In 1821, aristocrat Sessai Matsuyma ordered the erection of the monument. Its purpose was to console the spirits of the flies, crickets, and grasshoppers that had been killed in the production of a scientific text — an anatomical study of insects that Matsuyama himself had commissioned. Although the book, the Chuchi-jo, would become famous for its realistic rendering of the insects, it seems Matsuyama was plagued by guilt at having caused the deaths of so many fellow living creatures. Or perhaps he simply wanted to honor the bugs for their contribution. Today, the simple monument he built to honor insects sacrificed for science is designated as a historical monument by the Tokyo City government. 5 minutes walk from Uguisadani Station South exit",sacred spaces

As time wore on, this tradition died out, but one Buddhist monk by the name of Yoshinobu Fujioka has decided to bring it back to life by opening up Vowz, a bar in Yotsuya that is run by the young Fujioka and an older blind monk by the name of Gugan Taiguchi. You might think that a bar run by Buddhist monks to be a pretty strict atmosphere, but the bar is surprisingly relaxed. Even more surprising, the monks also make a pretty good drink as well. You can choose from many specialty drinks such as “Perfect Bliss”, “Infinite Hell” and “Enslavement to Love and Lusts”, and locals say they also make a mean White Russian. Taiguchi is often found doing sermons in the bar, and his words and advice are met with an attentive audience. At an actual temple, patrons are respectful and stick around even if they’re bored; at Vowz, however, the vibe of the bar is so relaxed that if someone is bored, they can just walk out with no worries of disrespect.

One can take an aerial tram up to the hot springs, or walk up the 1 km path. On clear days either route delivers spectacular views of the ominous Mt. Fuji. Once the springs are reached, kuro-tamago, or black eggs, can be purchased five at a time. The eggs are ordinary chicken eggs but the shell turns black due to being boiled in the hot sulfur spring. Local tradition holds that for each black egg eaten, seven years is added to one’s life. However, some say that eating more than two is not recommended. The valley is sometimes referred to as “The Death Valley” by locals. Some 3000 years ago Mount Hakone erupted leaving the hot spring filled crater. All along the path to the egg vendor are active sulfuric geysers, which can be hazardous at times. The area is prone to landslides due to the constant volcanic activity.

131,The Hydrangea Train,"Odawara, Japan",Coast along one of Japan’s mountain railways for coveted views of magnificent hydrangeas.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-hydrangea-train,"The picturesque Hakone Tozan Railway becomes an international sensation from mid-June through July, when thousands of spectacular hydrangea plants bloom along the tracks. The Hakone Tozan Railway is a functioning train route offering transportation between Odawara and Gōra stations, while a 10-minute cable car extends the journey from Gōra up to Sōunzan Station by another 1.2 kilometers. From June through July, this pastoral passageway is embellished with tens of thousands of exquisite hydrangeas that temporarily transform the railway line into what’s better known as the “Hydrangea Train.” The flowers mark Japan’s rainy season, known as tsuyu, which yields arresting technicolor blossoms. The species on view include both native and non-native varieties, though it’s believed that the hydrangea plant originated in Japan. Passengers can enjoy all manners of hydrangeas—from lacecaps to mopheads—in a variety of colors, which are determined by the soil’s acidity. According to Nippon.com, one of the best places to view the hydrangeas is the 16-kilometer stretch between Hakone Yumoto and Sōunzan Station, where the cable car stops. There, thousands of hydrangea plants flank the train’s pathway until it reaches a maximum altitude of 750 meters, where passengers are met with stunning views. Lower temperatures, due to altitude, prolong the blooms into mid-summer. The hydrangeas were purportedly planted in the 1970s by railway workers to replace the wild vegetation growing along the tracks. As they spread over the years, the blooms became a point of interest for locals and tourists from around the world. Train line employees take great care in keeping the hydrangeas well manicured to ensure their longevity in the seasons to come.  Odakyū Railway offers a rail pass called the Hakone Free Pass, which allows for unlimited rides on the Hakone Tozan Railway and Cable Car between Odawara and Sōunzan stations, as well as access to Hakone Tozan buses, the Hakone Ropeway, and Hakone Sightseeing Boats on Lake Ashinoko.",flowers railroads trains

Note the billboard on a nearby skyscraper saying simply, “Inner Trip.” Despite the fact that the complex looks like something out of Star Trek, the sect is less interested in laser guns than in promoting world peace. Though the temple may seem austere in comparison to traditional Buddhist temples, the monks are always amiable to visitors. The building is open to the public and offers free Japanese lessons for foreigners, a temple with an eight-meter Buddha carved from thousand-year-old camphor wood, and most oddly, a reservoir containing 400 tons of drinking water, to be used during emergencies of an unspecified nature. 3 min walk from Kamiyacho subway stop, Hibiya Line",sacred spaces

134,Harukor,"Tokyo, Japan",Tokyo’s only Ainu restaurant serves Indigenous food from northern Japan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/harukor,"Even within Japan, the food, culture, and history of the Ainu—an Indigenous people native to the country’s northernmost main island, Hokkaido, as well as Russia’s Sakhalin and Kuril Islands—is not well known. But at Harukor, a small izakaya in Tokyo, diners can order ohaw (a delicate soup of wild vegetables and salmon that was once an Ainu staple), a crisp and light tempura made from the wild lily turep, and other dishes that combine Indigenous and Japanese influences. Opened in 2011 by Teruyo Usa, Harukor is both a gathering place for her fellow Ainu in Tokyo and a venue where non-Ainu can learn about the group and their history and culture, which the Japanese government spent decades repressing in the name of assimilation as they colonized Ainu homelands. The Ainu language was nearly wiped out by Japanese officials who banned cherished customs and allowed education only in Japanese. Ainu food faced similar stresses as Japan forced Ainu who mainly fished, hunted, and gathered wild ingredients to take up farming. The Harukor menu is an example of Indigenous resiliency and the Ainu’s success in safeguarding elements of their culture. Usa and her husband source ingredients such as venison, salmon, and root and wild vegetables from Hokkaido. The menu contains helpful explanations of little-known ingredients and dishes, including an entire section devoted to pukusa or kitopiro, a wild onion once widely eaten by the Ainu, who dried it and added it to soups, but whose consumption declined as its strong taste became a negative symbol of Ainu identity and culture. At Harukor, it is boiled with dried salmon flakes, marinated in soy sauce, and used as filling in dumplings. While welcoming Ainu guests who have few venues to safely express their identity—due to continued discrimination in Japan—Usa encourages non-Indigenous customers to ask questions. She often shares personal experiences; if you’re lucky, you’ll hear her sing while she plays the tonkori, a long and slender Ainu string instrument.  Harukor is located within walking distance of either Okubo Station or Shin-Okubo Station; the bar is rather easy to miss, so keep an eye out for the little wooden sign that reads ハルコロ (Harukoro).

It’s also one of the country’s cat islands, and the furry felines roaming the lakefront are usually happy to greet any visitors who come ashore. The island is so full of cats it’s sometimes called the “Town of Cats.” You can expect to find the cats lounging around the docks or snacking on a fish they’ve plucked from the “Inland Sea.” But the animals aren’t the only intriguing inhabitants on the island. According to local history, the roughly 400 people who call the island home are descended from a group of exiled samurai. During the 12th century, seven samurai were defeated in battle near Kyoto. They fled with their families to Okishima and remained in hiding on the island. As the years wore on, the samurai and their families seemed to fade from memory and were able to peacefully form their own little village. Centuries later, and many of their descendants still remain on the island. Most of the island’s current residents have one of seven surnames believed to be traced back to the escaped warriors. The majority of the locals earn their living from fishing the lake, making the island a rare freshwater fishing hub within Japan. Now, the island is a peaceful place with a quiet, serene atmosphere. Narrow streets wind through lush greenery and lead to lookouts with prime vistas of the lake. The closest train station is Omihachiman. From Omihachiman, buses take the 30-minute route to Horikiri New Port. Small ferries depart from Horikiri to Okishima Island 11 times per day on weekdays.

Some works are part of the original collection, donated by the Bennesse corporation, while others have been inspired to join in the years since the company turned the area into a thriving artistic bastion. While there are pieces of art scattered all over the island, the center of the project is considered to be the Tadao Ando designed museum and hotel that make up the Bennesse complex. Naoshima’s history, even when summarized probably a bit too concisely, is inspiring. In the 1980’s the chairman of Fukutake Publishing began looking for a home for their corporate art collection. Rather than build a museum in Tokyo, the chairman wondered if the islands he remembered from his youth might benefit from the influx of an artistic economy. Mineral resources, once the lifeblood of the islands were no longer profitable and the islands’ youth were leaving behind the remaining careers such as fishing and moving to bigger cities, all culminating in a depressed economy. Luckily a mayor from the island region reached out to the chairman and, over time, a plan evolved. To kick start the artistic revolution in the area, the great architect Tadao Ando was contracted to design the beginnings of a complex of museums that were quite dramatic on the inside, but surprisingly subtle on the outside, partially concealed by the surrounding land. This high profile project led to new commissions of site-specific works, especially in the town of Naoshima. The corporation, now known as Bennesse, created a foundation that runs the ever increasing amount of modern art that is on display in the town. There are certain pieces and experiences designed for hotel guests only, but there is much more that is open to all. Special attention should be paid to the fisherman’s houses in the port area, the sculptures on the grounds of the Bennesse Museum/Hotel and the Chichu Art Museum, dedicated to three different artists. Basically, you get on the ferry to Naoshima from the Japanese mainland. From there, there are a variety of options. Some sites are fair close to the ferry landing, including the fisherman's houses with a beautiful James Turrell piece, but we have made the GPS locator around the Tadao Ando designed Bennesse museums which is on the other side of the island. The Bennesse Artsite Naoshima websites can give suggestions and insights regarding shuttle busses, as can other tourist resources.",islands architectural oddities art architecture

Pedestrians can walk beneath breathtaking canopies of cotton candy-colored blossoms, or soak in nearby hot springs and spas while admiring the floral display. The Kawazu cherry trees were discovered in Kawazu in the 1950s. Noticing the blossoms had a deeper, more vivid pink color than other types of cherry trees, locals then deliberately planted seeds along the riverbank, giving the town its signature pink-striped waterway. The original Kawazu Sakura tree is planted in a residential area, which is still possible to view. People from across Japan—and beyond—venture to the town to experience its early blossoms.

The concrete apartment complex sheltered over 15,000 people and was considered luxurious at the time for its central heating, flushing toilets, and garbage chutes. It had schools, a hospital and a movie theater, everything a functional town might have. The “clouds” referred to the opaque fog that often surrounds the town, rendering it barely visible. Following the end of World War II, Japan had a rapid economic boom which was accompanied by serious environmental issues, including the outbreak of Yokkaichi asthma. It was caused by the emission of sulfur dioxide, so the Japanese government mandated petroleum refineries to install desulfurization equipment, resulting in the vitalization of sulfur production. Thus, the mining of sulfur eventually went out of demand. The Matsuo mine ceased operations in 1969, leaving the town with no residents or purpose. The eleven buildings have since been left to decay, giving the town the ambience of a post-apocalyptic setting over which emptiness reigns. The commonplace objects in the apartments and school communicate a rapid departure and an eerie sense of normalcy in this ghost town. The town is isolated both by mountains, which make travel difficult, and by the fog, which makes visibility almost impossible.

Here, at Ekibenya Matsuri, travelers bustle around choosing from nearly 200 different kinds of ekiben, portable meals meant for the Shinkansen bullet train and other local trains that set off from the cosmopolitan city’s central train station. A portmanteau of eki (Japanese for “station”) and ben (from the Japanese bento, meaning “boxed meal”), each ekiben holds bite-size holistic representations of Japan’s food culture, portioned out in compartments of beautifully designed bento boxes that resemble wrapped and string-tied gift boxes. At each train stop in Japan Railways’ vast network, vendors sell ekiben containing the specialties of that particular region. In Hyogo prefecture, this might mean the hipparidako meshi ekiben: A rice, octopus, eel, and vegetables dish served in a miniature takotsubo, modeled on the traditional earthen pot designed to catch octopus in the area. At Shizuoka station, travelers might line up for the tai meshi, a locally popular dish of sea bream and rice. But circling the displays at Ekibenya Matsuri, one can find most of these region-specific novelties, stacked against one another in a single frenetic train station shop. The popularity of Ekibenya Matsuri, which sells over 10,000 ekiben daily, covers the cost of sourcing ekiben from all the prefectures of Japan. Indulge your inner child with an ekiben shaped like a train. Or, take advantage of seasonal ekiben, made only with location-specific seasonal produce.

But at the Kyoto Starbucks Coffee Ninenzaka Yasaka Chaya, the decor takes an earlier era as inspiration, evoking the centuries when Japan’s merchant class lived in wooden townhouses, known as machiya. Kyoto is famous for retaining the greatest number of Edo-era (1603–1868) machiya, which, after a long period of disfavor, are now appreciated for their elegant, comfortable designs. In 2017, Starbucks opened a store on Ninenzaka, the historical road leading to the Kiyomizu-dera Temple, a massive tourist attraction. It’s no surprise that the coffee giant would want to open there, as the sloped street itself is a draw, lined with handsome historical houses and shops. To fit in, Starbucks set up shop in a two-story, 100-year-old machiya. Curtains at the entryway and lanterns on the exterior display the Starbucks mermaid, while inside next to the counter, an austere Japanese garden floods the insides with light. While the menu is fairly typical, customers can either sip at tables on the ground floor or ascend to the second, where elegant scrolls line the walls and tatami mats and cushions line the floors.

In an effort to preserve physical traces of the country’s history, the Japanese government designated a small portion of Koganei Park as a place where time would stand still forever. The Edo-Tokyo Tatemono En is an open-air architectural museum, but could be better thought of as a park. Thirty buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries from all around Tokyo were restored and relocated to the space, where they can be explored by future generations to come. As soon as you cross the threshold into the open air museum you are whisked away to another time. Even its visitor center originally served as a pavilion to commemorate the 2600th imperial year, which was then relocated to Koganei Park in 1941. Inside the Museum is a collection of houses and businesses, shops, and bathhouses, all of which would have been present on a typical middle-class street from Edo-period to Showa-era Tokyo. The west section is residential, with traditional thatched roof bungalows of the 19th century. Meiji-era houses are also on view, constructed in a more Western style after Japan opened its borders in 1868. The Musashino Sabo Café occupies the ground floor of one such house, where visitors can enjoy a cup of tea. Grand residences like that of Korekiyo Takahashi, an early 20th century politician assassinated over his controversial policies, demonstrate how the upper class lived during that time period. The east section is primarily businesses from the 1920s and ’30s, preserved with their wares on display. Visitors are free to wander through a kitchenware shop, a florist’s, an umbrella store, a bar, a soy sauce shop, a tailor’s, a cosmetics shop, and an inn complete with an operational noodle shop. The centerpiece is the bathhouse, divided into men’s and women’s sections. Japanese animator and director Hayao Miyazaki spent time in this museum sketching for his fantasy film Spirited Away, and traces of Edo-Tokyo Tatemono En are visible in the film, particularly in the movie’s fantastical bathhouse. He even designed the Museum’s mascot character, Edomaru. There is also a number of exhibits other than the buildings, both outdoor and indoor, including a 7th-century burial chamber and a tram from the 1960’s. Most of the indoor exhibition is temporary and changes every few months, often concerning local history. The park recruits volunteers as tour guides, some of whom dress in period style. There are often craft workshops hosted in the old houses where children can learn to make origami or pinwheels. Occasionally the staffers will put on a variety show in the pavilion, showcasing everything from traditional Japanese performance arts to contemporary magic tricks.  As per Japanese custom, guests are expected to take off their shoes when entering houses. Wear easily removable footwear to explore the houses. 5 minutes by bus from Musashi-Koganei Station (JR Chuo Line). 5 minutes by bus from Mitaka Station (JR Chuo Line and Sobu Line). 5 minutes by bus from Hana-Koganei Station (Seibu Shinjuku Line). 30 minutes on foot from Musashi-Koganei Station (north exit).",preservation houses homes parks museums and collections museums history architecture
144,Shimanami Kaido Bikeway,"Onomichi, Japan",The 43-mile route crosses through six islands with gorgeous views of the Seto Inland Sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shimanami-kaido-bikeway,"About 45 minutes from Hiroshima city is the quaint port town of Onomichi, known for its beautiful temples and sloping seaside hills. It’s also the starting point of a unique attraction, the Shimanami Kaido bikeway, a spectacular 43-mile route that island-hops its way across the Seto Inland Sea. Shimanami Kaido, which translates to the “Island-Wave-Sea,” is wonderfully and aptly named. It connects Japan’s main island, Honshu, with the island of Shikoku, passing through six islands along the way connected by one of the world’s longest series of suspension bridges. While it’s actually an expressway (also called Nishiseto Expressway), it’s unique for being the only land route between Honshu and Shikoku that can be traversed on foot or by bicycle. Parts of the route are spectacularly scenic, crossing long beautiful bridges over bright blue water and lush greenery. Other parts pass through small towns with industrial and commercial areas. The entire ride can be done in a day for experienced cyclists. Most people start in Onomichi and head south to the town of Imabari on Shikoku island, where you can take a bus or ferry back. The route also passes by plenty of attractions like museums, temples, castles, cherry blossoms, and campgrounds that are well worth visiting along the way. The above coordinates are for the cycling-themed Hotel Cycle in the Onomichi U2 building, a common starting point for biking the Shimanami Kaido. There are numerous bike rentals along the route; it's strongly recommended to reserve a bike in advance. Beware that parts of the route can be quite hilly and challenging.",panoramas sea roads sports transportation bridges islands
145,Kagaya,"Tokyo, Japan","Serving you alcohol with a side of insanity. Also, costumes!",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kagaya,"Good bartenders usually have a special skill. Sometimes they mix a good drink that keeps customers coming back over and over again, sometimes they juggle bottles and provide a show, and sometimes, they’re just a sympathetic ear after a long day’s work or an experience with heartbreak. Mark (not his real name) Kagaya (name of his shop), Kagaya’s bartender and owner, doesn’t really have any of those things going for him, but he has one thing that has patrons coming back for more: absolute insanity. Located in the basement of a Tokyo strip mall, Kagaya has allegedly been passed down from generation to generation, leading to its current state. The big draw of the bar is the crazy shenanigans that take the form of yelling, screaming, costumes, (worn by both Mark and bar patrons) and a dash of amateur puppetry. The brand of chaos that you get varies, judging from the personal accounts of former patrons, no two experiences in Kagaya seem to be alike. Sometimes ordering food takes the form of a twisted puppet show involving a teddy bear that showcases how good the food is, other times, you order by going through a coloring book. Kagaya-san works this izakaya-style bar with little help, usually just an old woman in her 70s to help out. If you talk to him about his life, according to different accounts, you might hear different stories. Sometimes he says the woman in the back is his mother; other times, she’s just hired help. Stocked with alcohol, animal costumes, novelty mugs, and other toys, the whole bar slowly turns into a demonstration of what would happen if you unleashed a bunch of adults into a toddler’s playroom and served them booze.",Unique Restaurants & Bars
146,Aogashima Volcano,"Aogashima, Japan",We heard you like volcanoes so we put a volcano in your volcano so you can die for sure...,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aogashima-volcano,"When you think of Japan, one of the first things that may cross your mind is the sprawling urban metropolis of Tokyo. What might not cross your mind is a volcanic island on a distant archipelago. However, it seems that the capital’s influence reaches far beyond the city limits, 200 miles to the small, beautiful volcanic island of Aogashima, where, technically, Tokyo governs the 170 residents. Truth is, there isn’t much to govern. Besides a few “minshukus” (a sort of budget bed and breakfast), a general store, and the helipad, there isn’t much to the settled area of the island. The main draw is the massive double volcano, with the island itself a giant volcano holding within itself a smaller volcano sprouting from its center. In fact, calling Aogashima a double volcano undersells it a bit as it is built from the remains of at least four submarine volcanoes. Though is has been a while since its last eruption, the island was the site of a series of earthquakes, known as an “earthquake swarm” in the 1780’s and a large eruption in 1785 that killed 130-140 people, nearly half of the island’s population. While it has been geologically calm since the 1780s, living next to an active volcano inside of another larger volcano, built from the remnants of previous destroyed volcanos, seems like asking for trouble. Aogashima, however, is a beautiful place to visit, and you can reach the island from Hachijō-jima by helicopter or ferry. There are hiking trails up to the rim of the interior volcano where you can cook eggs in the steam vents, beautiful views of the night sky absent light pollution, and a sauna powered by volcanic activity in town. Relaxed, quiet, and beautiful, it serves as an escape from the mania of modern Tokyo. It’s possible that Aogashima just might be worth getting blown to melty bits by a volcano.  The island is notorious for its limited access. There is one ferry from Hachijō-jima Island per day, but it reportedly has a 60% chance of getting cancelled due to mists and winds, which sometimes affect it for about a week. There is also one helicopter per day—whose chance of cancellation is about 30%—but it is limited to only 9 passengers. Since it is the only access for the island's inhabitants as well as people visiting it on business, the booking may be full for a month straight or more.",recursive places volcanoes islands geology
147,Kaindy Lake,"Saty, Kazakhstan",Submerged trees jut ghost-like out of an idyllic turquoise mountain lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaindy-lake,"Kaindy Lake is an idyllic mountain lake in Kazakhstan’s portion of the Tian Shan Mountains, close to the country’s largest city, Almaty. The lake was formed after an earthquake in 1911, which caused a major landslide, effectively creating a natural dam. Successively, rainwater filled the valley and created the lake. The lake is famous for the number of dead and bleached spruce trees that stick out of the water – remnants of the trees that were flooded when the lake was formed. The trees, together with the improbable turquoise water of the lake, make an incredibly scenic sight. Underwater, the imagery is even more stunning, as the trees have not decomposed and create the surreal vision of an underwater forest. Surprisingly, the lake sees few visitors, partly because Kaindy Lake is overshadowed by the more famous Bolshoe Almatinskoe Lake and the Kolsay Lakes, all of which are close by, but far easier to reach from Almaty. Thus, despite its proximity to a city with a population of more than one million, the lake retains a peaceful atmosphere. This lake is located in the canyon to the east of the Kolsay Lakes. Drive up to Zhalanash, the Regional Center, to the east of Almaty (turn to the right off the Narynkol highway just before reaching the Charyn River). Head from Zhalanash up to the Saty settlement in the west. This settlement is located 320km from Almaty. Turn left on the dirt road one kilometer before the village, by a cemetery. This road brings you up to the lake, but only a vehicle built for rougher terrain will make it.

148,The Last Wild Apple Forests,"Almaty, Kazakhstan","Granny Smiths and Fujis can both be traced back to Kazakhstan, where apples still grow wild.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-wild-apple-forests-almaty-kazakhstan,"It might seem strange to think that the common apple was not originally a universal fruit, but in fact it has its roots in one specific region of the world. The ancestor of the domestic apple is the Malus sieversii, which grows wild in the Tian Shan mountains of Kazakhstan. In the early 20th century, biologist Nikolai Vavilov first traced the apple genome back to a grove near Almaty, a small town whose wild apples are nearly indistinguishable from the Golden Deliciouses found at grocery stores today. Vavilov visited Almaty and was astounded to find apple trees growing wild, densely entangled and unevenly spaced, a phenomenon found nowhere else in the world. Scientists believe the Tian Shan apple seeds were first transported out of Kazakhstan by birds and bears long before humans ever cultivated them. By the time humans did begin to grow and trade apples, the Malus sieversii had already taken root in Syria. The Romans discovered it there, and dispersed the fruit even further around the world. When modern genome sequencing projects affirmatively linked domestic apples to Malus sieversii, Almaty and its surrounding land were officially recognized as the origin of all apples. Almaty’s former name, Alma-Ata,  means “father of apples,” and the town touts its heritage proudly. A fountain in the center of town is apple-shaped, and vendors come out each week to sell their many varieties of domesticated apples at market. Apples weren’t always a precious fruit in Almaty though. They used to be commonplace, and during Soviet development many of the trees were cut down for their wood. Up to 80 percent of the wild apple forests were destroyed. Today, reserves throughout the Tian Shan mountain range keep the last wild apple forests growing safely—except from foraging bears, who don’t care at all about botanical history. Pomologists report that the wild apples have a variety of flavors, depending on how the bees pollinate the blossoms. There are honey- and berry-flavored apples, sour crabapples, apples that taste like licorice, and a few strains that would be good enough for a supermarket’s produce section.  The apple forests only exist in patches along the Tian Shan mountain range now. There are various protected sections in the Ile-Alatau National Park, but hiring a guide to take you there is recommended as they are difficult to find.",apples nature preserves flora forests fruit trees ecosystems plants
149,Aral Sea,"Aralsk, Kazakhstan",Rusting ships sit in a desert where a sea used to be.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aral-sea,"A man made environmental disaster has left a once-great sea dry, the land polluted, and the locals inundated with disease. The destruction of the Aral Sea is a strange legacy of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union sought to increase its production of cotton. The decision was made in 1960 to irrigate land in the recently assimilated central Asian countries and develop their own cotton industry. At the time, the Aral Sea was the world’s fourth largest inland sea. By 1937, the area had successfully become a major exporter of cotton with little impact on the natural environment. But starting in the 1950s, aggressive Soviet irrigation projects stemming from the Aral Sea started to have an adverse impact. Between 1960 and 1980, the water level dropped by 20 meters, exposing sea beds, and increasing the salinity levels of the lake until the fish population died off. Today, the sea is nearly dry and has separated into two much smaller seas. Fishing boats sit aground, rusting in a vast contaminated desert wasteland. To make what is an already horrific situation worse, on the island of Vozrozhdeniye, in the center of the former Aral Sea are the remains of the Soviet Union’s extensive bio-warfare experimentation. Experiments with anthrax, plague and smallpox were conducted here in open air tests in the 1950s. The base was hastily abandoned in the 1990s following the breakup of the Soviet Union, the canisters of disease agents buried, and the land coated with bleach. In the years since the abandonment, the island has slowly become part of the mainland. A US anti-terrorist team visited the remains of the island in 2001, in theory to clean up any remaining bio-warfare agents, but a visit by author Nick Middleton in 2005 showed signs that there is still plenty to be worried about. He found the island crawling with local looters, disturbing old buildings, and wearing no protection. Test tubes and feeding troughs for test animals were still in place. Although some diseases like smallpox can be virtually eliminated by exposure to UV over time, the same can not be said for Anthrax which has a very long and stubborn lifespan, and once inhaled, has a mortality rate of 90%. The local population suffers from abnormally high cancer rates, tuberculosis, and anemia, made worse by the poverty caused from the death of the formerly lucrative local fishing industry. The causes for the diseases are being traced back to the pesticides used on the cotton crops to the south. In 2000, UNESCO developed a rescue plan for the area which attempts to reclaim water for the sea by 2025, but it is regarded as unrealistic by many. The people with most ability to directly impact this is the government of Uzbekistan, where the cotton fields are, but they are reluctant to make any changes as their country’s delicate economy hinges on the success of the cotton crop. The World Bank funded a small dam that has protected and even raised water levels in the northern portion of the sea, but most agree that the rest could disappear completely within 15 years. The remains of the sea are remote, reachable after a day’s drive through the desert. Update November 2017: The local Mayor ordered the removal and scrapping of all rusting Aral ships; the only example now remaining is at the Aralsk Port Museum.  The old fishing town of Aralsk at the north of the Aral Sea is on the Northern Kazakhstan train line, but is difficult to get to as it is between stops, and is a 36 hour train ride from Almaty.",long now locations disaster areas ghost towns water
150,Baikonur Cosmodrome,"Baikonur, Kazakhstan","World's oldest and largest space launch facility, once a secret missile testing site.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baikonur-cosmodrome,"“Dear friends, known and unknown to me, my dear compatriots and all people of the world! Within minutes from now, a mighty Soviet rocket will boost my ship into the vastness of outer space. What I want to tell you is this. My whole life is now before me as a single breathtaking moment. I feel I can muster up my strength for successfully carrying out what is expected of me.” Those were the words of Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961, minutes before the cosmonaut lifted off in the Vostok 1 spacecraft, becoming the first human to reach outer space and enter orbit around the Earth. His journey began at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the world’s oldest and largest space launch facility, set in the desolate desert steppe of Kazakhstan. The Cosmodrome was built in the 1950s as a secret missile testing site and as the base of operations for the Soviet space program. Using the name and coordinates of the small mining town of Baikonur, about 200 miles northeast of the actual launch complex, the former Soviet Union deliberately attempted to mislead the West about the facility’s true location. No amount of obfuscation could hide the Cosmodrome from America’s famous U-2 spy planes, however. One of the high-altitude reconnaissance jets spotted the complex in the summer of 1957, around the same time that the facility was testing the first intercontinental ballistic missiles and just months before Sputnik 1, the first man-made satellite put into space, was launched from its pads. In fact, as the most active spaceport in the world, the Baikonur Cosmodrome has a long list of achievements, some of which tend to be overshadowed by Gagarin’s famed flight. And occasionally, as in the case of Sputnik 2, an accomplishment is marred by a tragic back story. Laika, a stray mutt with astronomically bad luck, was taken from the streets of Moscow to Baikonur only to undergo months of training for a certain-death mission that saw her become the first animal to reach space. It was not until 2002, over forty years after the mission, that a former Sputnik scientist finally came clean about the details of the dog’s death, which had been caused by heat exhaustion only five to seven hours after the launch. Today, the Cosmodrome is a far less secretive place, and visitors can learn about the history of the Soviet and Russian space programs at the museum in the city of Baikonur just outside the complex. And for more explosive thrills, tours offered by private companies offer the public a chance to witness the launches of manned and unmanned space missions from the Cosmodrome facilities. The closest train stop to the Baikonur Cosmodrome is the Tyuratam station. The city's two airports, Krainiy and Yubileyniy serve only semi-regular chartered flights from Almaty and Moscow. The nearest town with scheduled service is Kzyl-Orda, which has scheduled daily flights to Almaty and Astana on Air Astana.",cosmonauts strange science retro-tech instruments of science space exploration
151,Big Almaty Lake,"Almaty, Kazakhstan",A brilliant turquoise lake in the mountains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/big-almaty-lake,"Joining the ranks of brilliant blue lakes like Kaindy Lake and Issyk Lake, is Big Almaty Lake, which is situated outside Kazakhstan’s largest city. This alpine lake’s unusual teal hue and surrounding nature make it one of the most beautifully surreal sites in the country. Big Almaty Lake is a natural reservoir perched high in the Ili Alatau mountains, more than 8,000 feet above sea level, backdropped by three peaks that rise above the canyon. The color varies depending on the time of the year, but expect the brightest and most beautiful turquoise during September and early October. The lake takes on a more milky blue hue during spring due to the melting snow. One of the things that make Big Almaty Lake unique is that it is forbidden to swim in the lake, as it is the main water source for the residents of Almaty. Pipes carry the water from the reservoir down the mountains to the city. There are several guards walking around to ensure that no one oversteps the boundaries and goes down to the lake’s shore. Hiking opportunities are in abundance at the lake, as it’s located within Ili-Alatau National Park, and the famous Big Almaty Peak is in the vicinity. Do be careful where you hike and walk, however. Many routes are closed off because they lead to the Kyrgyzstan border, which has been closed since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The lake is located very close to the city of Almaty, and can easily be visited as a half-day trip from the city. The easiest way to get there is by taxi. The fare there and back should be around 6000 KZT. If you order a taxi on a phone app, have it wait for you if you're not planning to be there all day. It won't be that much extra. You can also have your taxi stop up or down the way on the mountain to get photos on the gorgeous drive. Another option for getting to and from Big Almaty Lake is to hitchhike, although this should be done at your own risk. Visiting the lake itself is free of charge, but you must pay a fee to enter the Ili-Alatau park at the bottom of the mountain. The fee is a little over $1 USD.",blue color lakes mountains water

But it is the lake that almost wasn’t. The lake was originally formed around 8,000 years ago when a rockslide clogged up the gorge into which the water used to flow. For thousands of years, the picturesque turquoise waters sat, relatively unknown and unremarked upon other than by locals or explorers. In the 1930s, the region around the lake finally saw some development intended to bring tourism to the lovely body of water. In the late 1950s, the USSR established the area as a park and built a hotel and restaurant inside it. Issyk Lake was placed on the Almaty-visit list and itinerary for Moscow’s elite when they came for visits. It’s rumored that Nikita Khrushchev enjoyed coming to the lake. A picture of Lenin was carved into the rocks in the park and is still present today. The burgeoning tourism industry was dealt a major blow in the 1960s when a massive mudslide wiped out much of the infrastructure that was being built, as well as the natural dam that had clogged the gorge for thousands of years. It was reported that more than a hundred people were killed in the tragedy, but officials now say the number was closer to 2,000 or 3,000 lives lost, and the lake flooded out down the gorge. The dam was eventually rebuilt in the 1990s, and the lake restored, but this new humanmade body of water ended up being almost twice as small as the previous lake. Nature tourists have since returned to the site, but many of the locals who remember the tragedy know it doesn’t look the same. This being said, the waters of Issyk Lake, while smaller, still range into all kinds of stunning blues. The town of Issyk is around a one-hour bus ride from Almaty, Kazakhstan’s most cosmopolitan city. There are some small markets, mosques, and churches to poke around while in town. From anywhere in Issyk, the snowy Tianshan Mountains can be seen posing in the distance.",lake natural wonders water nature

The abandoned mining town in South Kazakhstan was once a bustling place. With subsidized support from Moscow and highly profitable ore mining, many people came for food and clothing during the Soviet era. The shops were always full, and the miners’ salaries were much higher than in many of the surrounding areas. Polymetal ore with very high lead content was shipped from the mines about 90 miles to a plant in Shymkent. According to legend, one out of every seven bullets fired during the Great Patriotic War was cast from Bayzhansay lead. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, ore mining stopped, and the town all but emptied out. The houses where miners once lived, as well as schools, baths, and administrative buildings are almost completely destroyed now. Among the dilapidated stone buildings, there’s a mosque that gets a new coat of paint every once in awhile, and a few families live in the area during the summers. Winter would leave anyone stranded. It takes about 3.5 hours to reach the city from Shymkent.

154,Zharkent Mosque,"Zharkent, Kazakhstan",This unique wooden mosque resembling a Chinese pagoda was said to be built without the use of nails.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zharkent-mosque,"Visitors could be forgiven for assuming they’d accidentally crossed the border from Kazakhstan into nearby China when they come across this unique former mosque, current museum. The Zharkent mosque dates to around 1886, not long after the town was officially settled as a far-flung outpost of Tsarist Russia. Zharkent was a small Uighur settlement prior to official Russian township status and the mosque was sponsored by a wealthy local Uighur merchant, Valiakhun Yuldashev. Yuldashev needed an architect who would comply with his demands to create a mosque and madrasa built entirely out of wood, using no nails. He chose Chinese architect Hong Pik. According to one local rumor, Hong Pik had created such astounding buildings in China that his life was threatened by customers who didn’t want anyone else to have what they had. Rather than forfeit his life or his livelihood, Hong Pik fled to Zharkent, the farthest place he could find a new customer. A competing legend claims that when Hong Pik finished his work and returned to China, he was executed for giving away Chinese architectural secrets. No one really knows what happened to the architect, but his creation still stands, built with wood from fir trees in the nearby Tien Shan mountains. The complex includes a madrassa and a mosque. According to the local tour guide, while classrooms were segregated by gender, instruction was available to both girls and boys. The mihrab (prayer niche) and original main entrance to the mosque are similar in style to Central Asian Islamic architecture found throughout Central Asia. But the minaret, mosque exterior, and minbar (pulpit) are more like  Chinese pagodas in design and decoration. Many of those decorations feature plants and flowers, contravening Muslim rules that limit depictions of living things in religious buildings. It can hold some 1,000 worshipers, with women using the top floor gallery and men on the main floor. During Soviet times, when religious observances were discouraged and even banned, the mosque was re-purposed for various uses including a store, a cinema and even stables. Eventually they turned it into a museum, which it remains today. The mosque has undergone repairs over the years to repair damage from wear and tear and several earthquakes. While it may have originally been constructed without nails, they have been added in various stages of repair and restoration. Inside the old classrooms are additional exhibits of local art and artifacts from the Kazakh and Uighur people who lived in the area before the Russians.  In the Latin alphabet Zharkent is alternately spelled Djarkent and Jarkent, and during Soviet times was renamed Panfilov, after a World War II war hero. It reverted to Zharkent in 1991. Depending on your map, you may find the town under any of these names. The museum is open most days from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. for guided tours, but hours posted on the door may reflect changes. While guided tours seem to be required, your guide may only speak Russian and/or Kazakh. The entrance fee is 300 Tenge per person, with another 500 Tenge requested if you want to take pictures inside the mosque. Although the “per person” or “per group” rules on the latter fee seem to be negotiable.",

It consists of numerous ball-like rock formations strewn across a wide range of steppe land. The balls range in size from tiny marble-like rocks to huge boulders the size of a car. The phenomenon is poorly researched, but there could be a number of geological explanations from megaspherulites - crystalline balls formed in volcanic ash and then revealed by weathering - to cannonball concretions - a process where sediment accumulates around a harder core - to spherical weathering wherein the conditions are just right to erode rocks into spherical form. In this case due to the range of sizes the most likely explanation is that of spherulite formation. Visible from the Valley is Sherkala (Lion Rock), a stunning 332m white and ochre chalk outcrop with numerous fissures along its rim and even more rock formations at its foot.

Representing all of the world’s religious faiths, the Palace houses educational facilities, a national center for Kazakhstan’s various geographical and ethnic groups, and a 1,500-seat opera house. The diversity is represented in the design of the entire building, which clearly resembles a massive triangle, 62 meters tall with a base that is 62 meters by 62 meters square. The lower portions of the triangle are clad in pale granite while the upper portions feature stained glass featuring doves designed by Brian Clarke. Because of the extreme environment in which the pyramid sits, engineers had to design a steel and concrete skeleton that is able to withstand the expansions and contractions brought on by temperatures that vary from -40 to 40 degrees Celsius. 51.122826,71.46546",sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture

Nicknamed Kazakhstan’s Grand Canyon, the destination is part of a national park and the Charyn River valley, fed by the local Tianshan Mountains. There’s a gravel road running along the canyon bottom, and smaller footpaths wind up and around the many formations and columns. The sedimentary red sandstone varies in shade from deep orange to light brown, shaped by millions of years of erosion. The multicolored rock layers are the product of different stages of sediment deposits, and are often crumbly to the touch The Valley of Castles is the canyon’s most well-known spot, with particularly eye-catching structures of a bright red hue. It’s about one or two kilometers long and 100 meters in depth, and can really scorch in the summer. If you need to cool off, it’s possible to swim in the river—or even kayak, raft, or fish; the local fish is called the osman. The entire canyon is a total of about 80 kilometers (50 miles) long. Charyn Canyon sits within the Uygur District, Raiymbek District and Enbekshikazakh District of the Almaty Province. It’s about a two-hour drive from Almaty; you can take a tour bus, hire a taxi, or rent a car. It’s become more of a destination over recent years, which means weekend crowds and scattered trash. Still, you’ll need to pack your own lunch and bring a bottle or two of water, since you’ll find no food stands or convenience stores.

The Polygon was the primary nuclear test site of the Soviet Union. In total, 456 nuclear tests have been conducted between 1949 and 1989 at Semipalatinsk, including 340 underground and 116 atmospheric explosions. Altogether, the number of nuclear explosions at Semipalatinsk equals more than 2,500 Hiroshima bombs. A huge number of craters, partly filled with water, testify to these experiments. It was not the only nuclear test site of the Soviet Union, but it was the only one close to major settlements. The Soviet Union conducted these nuclear tests without regard to the health effects on the 200,000 residents of the Semipalatinsk area, who weren’t evacuated or warned during the actual explosions. Local residents soon became aware of what was going on, and witnessed health problems soon after the first tests. Cancer rates in the Polygon area skyrocketed and a couple of years following the first tests, a disturbingly high number of children with genetic defects were born. There was nothing the people could do about it, since they were not allowed to leave the boundary of the closed city area. Finally, in 1989, an anti-nuclear movement called “Nevada Semipalatinsk“ was formed, that forced the weak and crumbling Soviet Union to refrain from further nuclear tests and to close the site. Following the independence of Kazakhstan, the closed city status was abolished. The site may have been closed and the tests may have stopped, but the legacy of the nuclear tests lingers on. An area of more than 18,000 square kilometers is heavily contaminated and seemingly as many as 1.5 million people – a tenth of the total population of the country – have been diagnosed with health problems that can be attributed directly or indirectly to the nuclear tests. Even today, people continue to live in the Polygon area. Since this is one of the poorer regions of Kazakhstan, few people have been able to move away. Those who stayed continue to rely on contaminated local crops and water, and even dismantle structures of the Polygon to obtain scrap metal they can sell. Cancer rates, including leukemia, are still as extraordinarily high as they were decades ago, as are infertility and depression. Still, one in twenty children are born with severe birth defects – and almost none of the other nineteen are born healthy. The disturbing 2010 documentary film “After the Apocalypse“ describes the current situation of the site.  The place can be visited with a permit.

159,Soyuz 11 Memorial,"Zhanaarka District, Kazakhstan","The remains of a monument in the remote Kazakhstani desert dedicated to the only men to die in outer space, the crew of the Soyuz 11 rocket.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soyuz-memorial,"Located in the center of Kazakhstan, 16 miles of desert away from the nearest road, lies a giant, black monument that only a small handful of people have ever laid their eyes on. This is the Soyuz 11 Memorial. Every man who has ever lived was born on Earth — a record that it’s estimated won’t be broken until 2050. But there have been men — three, to be exact — who died far outside of Earth’s atmosphere. Of the 439 people ever sent into space, only 18 never made it back, and of these 18, only the three-man crew of the Soyuz 11 died in “outer space”, defined by the U.S. government as at least 50 miles away from the surface of the Earth. The Soyuz 11, a Russian rocket which launched in June of 1971, was the only manned mission to ever board the world’s first space station, Salyut 1. There, the crew set the world record for the longest amount of time spent in space, at 22 days, which was broken by the American “Skylab 2” two years later. Despite a fire on day 11 and the fact that the entire spaceship vibrated when the treadmill was turned on, the mission went well. That is, until it was time to go home. Just after leaving the space station, the three crew members died of asphyxiation. This was caused by a minor technical mistake when the two bolts linking the orbital module and the descent module were popped open simultaneously (as opposed to sequentially). This doubled the exerted force, rupturing the valve that automatically stabilized the spacecraft’s pressure. The pressure inside the spacecraft dropped to zero in three and a half minutes. The rocket landed in rural Kazakhstan hours later, where a rescue crew went to retrieve the bodies. According to the chair of the Russian State Commission, the crew found that the bodies of the three men were “motionless, with dark-blue patches on their faces and trails of blood from their noses and ears.” To honor their memory, at the exact location that the Soyuz 11 landed in the middle of nowhere, the Russian government built a large black monument with three sides, each engraved with the face of one of the three crew members. Constructed in 1973, it was hardly ever visited due to its remote location, but it paid due respect to those who lost their lives for the Space Race. Unfortunately, it only lasted 39 years. In 2012, a group of visitors found that the monument had been vandalized. Only metal bars and scattered ruins remain. As of 2016 a new, smaller monument has been installed reading, “the feat of the crew ‘Soyuz-11’ will always be stored in the memory of grateful descendants. Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsaev proved the possibility of a prolonged stay of man is of the earth, laying the foundation for future space projects.” Perhaps the best way for the legacy of the crew of the Soyuz 11 to live on is in the hearts and minds of all who remember their sacrifice on our continuing journey into space.",dead explorers communist monuments explosions communist architecture exploration space exploration death memorials monuments
160,Ascension Cathedral,"Almaty, Kazakhstan","In Kazakhstan, a colorful cathedral with many lives once survived the most powerful earthquake in the region.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ascension-cathedral,"The eye-catching golden domes and kaleidoscopic color scheme of the Ascension Cathedral in Almaty, Kazakhstan, draw visitors to the city’s Panfilov Park, but the building’s genius architecture and complex history demand just as much attention. After nearly 40 years of deliberations, construction of Almaty’s Ascension Cathedral began in 1904, according to architect Constantin Arkadyevich Borisoglebsky’s design. However, as Borisoglebsky had left the city in 1902, it was regional engineer Andrei Pavlovich Zenkov who made addendums to Borisoglebsky’s plans and oversaw construction. As such, it’s commonly called the Zenkov Cathedral. Construction was completed in 1907. In addition to the church’s striking beauty, the architecture and engineering command respect; at a height of 56 meters, the Ascension Cathedral is one of the tallest wooden constructions in the world. It’s widely believed that the church was built entirely without metal. However, while the vast majority of the structure is made of Tien-Shan spruce, there are a small number of nails, bolts, and other metal pieces. The church’s interior came from artistic workshops in Moscow and Kyiv, while the icons were painted by local artist and ethnographer, Nikolay Gavrilovich Khludov. The Orthodox community attended services there until 1927 when they were banned by the Soviet regime. The Cathedral was subsequently vandalized and looted. Over the ensuing decades, it served a variety of public functions, including an exhibition center, concert hall, and the first Central Museum of Kazakhstan. The Cathedral’s bell tower was also the site of Kazakhstan’s first radio transmission center, placed there in the early 1930s. Extensive renovations took place in 1976, and the cathedral was finally returned to the Orthodox church in 1995. The massive earthquake that destroyed most of the buildings in Almaty—then known as Verniy—in 1887 must have left an impression because Borisoglebsky’s design was meant to be earthquake-proof. He included what he called a “seismic basket,” fitting the building’s wooden beams with metal braces and brackets that allowed them to sway with the motion of an earthquake if another one struck, which it did in 1911, laying waste to most of the surrounding buildings. The cathedral’s survival contrasted so sharply with the surrounding ruin that local bishops called it an act of God. Zenkov’s response to that, if he had one, was not recorded, but he was certainly proud of his engineering. He wrote with awe that during the earthquake the bell tower waved like the top of a tall tree in a high wind, bent but unbroken.  The cathedral is located in Panfilov Park in the center of Almaty, Kazakhstan, and is easily accessible by public transport.",cathedral churches sacred spaces

This two-story green market, in business since 1875, puts most farmers’ markets to shame, with its wide array of Kazakh delights, ranging from fizzy, alcoholic milk to horse sausage. Rows of vendors sell meticulously arranged baskets of kurt, smooth balls of a dry, salty cheese made from fermented mare’s or sheep’s milk. The cheesemongers also sell kumis, a lightly alcoholic beverage made with fermented mare’s milk, which they ladle out of buckets into small soup bowls. Dried apricots, raisins, figs, and other fruit and nuts lie like little jewels on trays, next to fresh fruit being pressed on hand-cranked juicers. The smell of freshly cut flowers, spices, and produce lingers as one walks through the bazaar. From salty camel’s milk to fish roe to horseradish condiments, customers are encouraged to have a taste as they peruse the stalls. The meat selection at the bazaar is extensive, including an entire section dedicated to horsemeat. Here, beneath slabs of hanging meat, butchers prepare and sell varieties of horsemeat sausages, including shuzhuk and qazı, a spicy, garlicky sausage made from horsemeat ribs seasoned and stuffed inside a horse intestine. Sheep’s heads, considered a delicacy, are sold too. On festive occasions, koy bas, a boiled sheep’s head preparation (served cold, with a garnish of onions) is a typical accompaniment to beshbarmak, the popular Kazakh meat-and-noodles dish. The first iteration of the bazaar was built in 1875, as a stopping point for traveling merchants. Though its newer modern building bears few similarities to the original, the market still serves as a place where cultures and cuisines can mingle. Rows of vendors sell spices, nuts, and dried fruit from across Central Asia, as well as honey and fresh breads. There are even stalls selling kimchi. If you’re still hungry after the generously proffered tasting samples, stop over for tea and noodles at one of the food stalls lining the perimeter. And if you must be a tourist, embroidered Kazakh hats, jackets, and intricately woven slippers are some of the beautiful souvenirs on display.  The market is open every day except Monday. The market closes at 7 p.m.",nomad foods milk cheese markets meat horses alcohol

The grove lines the Avenue of the Cosmonauts, as it’s called, and each is designated with a plaque with the crew member’s name and the year. Gagarin’s tree stands the tallest, while recent Soyuz crews have smaller saplings growing from the soil.

A huge transparent tent, 150 m high and covering 140,000 m², which has been purposefully built to give the population of Astana a relief from the harsh winter climate of Northern Kazakhstan. Khan Shatyr was designed by British architect Norman Foster, who is also responsible for the pyramidal Palace of Peace and Reconciliation – another one of Astana’s architectural marvels. Inside the huge structure of Khan Shatyr are a number of entertainment options, such as a park, a boating river, a minigolf course, a shopping centre and even an indoor beach resort. Regardless of the outside temperature extremes, the internal temperature is moderate year-round, varying between 15 and 30° C, which is achieved by the use of the infiltrated sunlight, as well as air heating and cooling systems. Khan Shatyr was unveiled by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2006 and was opened in 2010, on the 70th birthday of Nazarbayev.

That’s what makes Bayterek Tower such a fitting name for a national monument steeped in symbolism and meaning, connecting the old world to the modern in a celebration of progress. Located in Astana, Kazakhstan, every element of Bayterek Tower was designed with the intention of imparting meaning to visitors and citizens alike, right down to the height of the tower, which stands 97 meters tall to represent 1997, the year in which Astana was named the capital of Kazakhstan. The unusual construction of the tower is more than just a unique artistic flourish. The golden sphere that rests atop the many pointed spires of the tower is meant to symbolize an egg nestled amongst tree limbs – a nod to an age-old local folktale about happiness and beginnings, focusing on a bird who laid its egg in the sacred tree of life. This combination of the old and the new is intriguing and inspiring to both Kazakhs and visitors, who are invited to travel to the top of the tower and see views of the city from an observation deck inside its golden dome. Not only does this provide a unique tourist attraction, but also yet another means of symbolism, as visitors travel inside the “egg” of happiness and beginnings, able to see the modern world from a place of history and legend.",shops monuments architectural oddities architecture
165,Beatles Statue of Almaty,"Almaty, Kazakhstan",Beatlemania is still going strong... at least in Kazakhstan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beatles-statue-almaty,"Bronzing items which one finds important, and well worth saving, isn’t a rare practice. Attics and closets across the world are filled with bronze baby shoes, bronze hand prints and, less commonly, the occasional bronze tail. So it makes sense that somewhere in the world there would be at least one place to find The Beatles in bronze. Luckily, this shiny piece of pop culture on the side of the well-traveled tourist locale of Kok Tobe mountain in Almaty, Kazakhstan isn’t the actual Beatles dipped in bronze (so far as anyone can tell)—just a whimsical sculpture. The youthful, cartoonish representation of the worldwide musical sensation was created in 2007 by artist Eduard Kazaryan as an homage to the popularity and universal appeal of the group, and as another piece of artistic flair to go along with the existing attractions in Kazakhstan’s largest city. The statue stands near the artistic Almaty Tower on the popular mountain, which it seems is starting to be a rallying point for artists and tourists alike due to the attractive scenic vistas and popular activities the mountain provides visitors to the area.",rock and roll music monuments statues

167,Ruins of Sauran,"Sauran, Kazakhstan","This was once the largest city in Kazakhstan, and a major stop on the Silk Road.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-of-sauran,"Located in what is now South Kazakhstan, Sauran may have been originally settled as early as the seventh century. By the 10th century it was a flourishing metropolis, described by the medieval geographer Al-Maqdisi as a “large city surrounded by seven walls.” Archeologists were puzzled when they failed to find the seven walls in these ruins, until they found another nearby site and realized that the city moved sometime in the 12th or 13th century. No one knows why the city was moved. Some believe that the original city was abandoned because of the presence of bubonic plague, likely brought from traders traveling the Silk Road. Others believe it was abandoned after it was conquered by Genghis Khan. However, it served as the capital for the Mongol White Horde through the time of Tamerlane, but it seems that as the empire declined, so did the fortunes of Sauran. By the 14th century, Sauran was undergoing a resurgence, and was rebuilt on its current site. During its heyday, the poet Wāṣefi described it in the 16th century as “cheerful and bright, with soft invigorating air” and containing “all sorts of beautiful trees.” Sauran remained a key city in Central Asia until the 18th century, when the nearby city of Turkistan, 35 kilometers (22 miles) to the southeast, began to dominate the region. The secret to Sauran’s centuries of prosperity in the desert is its extensive arrangement of underground irrigation canals. Known as a kyariz system, it used horizontal tunnels to take advantage of the natural flow from mountain aquifers and the confluence of three small rivers: Tastaksay, Aksay and Maydantal. Vertical wells were dug every 50 meters (164 feet) along the tunnels which allowed access to water and served as air vents for the slaves who dug the canals. Bellows were also used to pump fresh air underground for the diggers, who wore flotation devices made from pumpkin skins to protect against drowning during flash flooding. The city was more recognizable for what was above ground, which included two towering minarets with unique construction. Made from brick with internal spiral staircases, they were made to sway, or at least appear to sway. Early written accounts suggest they were designed to amaze visitors and enhance the reputation of the city as a center of the Islamic world. Sadly, the towers collapsed in the late 19th century. Rumors abound that J.R.R. Tolkien named the character Sauron in The Lord of the Rings after this ancient city with two towers, but in fact, “Sauron” is derived from Old Norse meaning “abominable.” Regardless, the ruins and history of Sauran stimulate the imagination as much as any fantasy story.  The ruins of Sauran should not be confused with the Village of Sauran, although they are cosily proximate.   The ruins can be easily reached from Turkistan by driving northwest along the Turkistan–Kyzylorda highway (M32) for about 46 km.  The ruins are about 12 km beyond the village and the road to them is paved.",cities roads literature ruins
168,Medeu,"Almaty, Kazakhstan",This Soviet-era athletic and recreation facility is the highest ice skating rink in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/medeu,"Nestled in a wooded mountain valley just outside of Almaty, Kazakhstan, Medeu is an outdoor skating rink notable not only for its breathtakingly beautiful location, but also for its distinction as the highest Olympic-sized skating rink in the world. Sitting 1,691 meters (5,548 feet) above sea level, Medeu was originally built in 1949 and serves as an illustrative example of the scope, ambition, and slightly odd superlative aims of Soviet-era construction projects. Consisting of 10,500 square meters (over 110,000 square feet) of ice, it was one of the top speed skating venues in the world from its opening in 1951 right up until the disintegration of the USSR. During that period, some 120 world records were set at Medeu. Additionally, the site served as the home rink for the Almaty bandy team Dynamo Alma-Ata, and also hosted several international bandy games. Bandy is basically hockey — in actual fact it predates hockey — played with a ball instead of a puck. In 1972, Medeu transitioned from natural ice to artificial ice, and its unique artificial ice freezing system is still in use to this day. The facility fell into disrepair after the fall of the Soviet Union, but has been revived in the past decade, being used as a centerpiece for (unsuccessful) bids by Almaty to host the Winter Olympics, and serving as center ice for bandy matches in both the 2011 Asian Winter Games and the 2012 Bandy World Championship. Visitors who are neither Olympians nor professional bandy players can nevertheless enjoy a recreational skate on Medeu’s storied ice, or take a panoramic climb to the top of the dam south of Medeu, which protects the valley from mud flows. One Medeu enthusiast states that the rink’s “unique location makes its ice superglidey,” which is a rather dubious claim (although the Wikipedia entry for the Utah Olympic Oval — elevation 4,675 feet — claims that “low air resistance” at that elevation led to the extraordinary number of records set at the 2002 Winter Olympics, so maybe there’s something to it). However, the same enthusiast goes on to say that skating at Medeu, “surrounded by mountains and fir trees, spurred on by Russian pop music: it doesn’t get any better.” Now THAT sounds right on the money.",soviet architecture soviet history sports
169,Kieli Agash (Sacred Tree) of Auliyeagash,"Auliyeagash, Kazakhstan",Local lore says this 700-year-old tree has sacred and medicinal properties.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacred-tree-of-auliyeagash,"The Zharkent area of Kazakhstan doesn’t get a lot of tourists, so if you do happen to find yourself there, locals are likely to highlight one of the most important sights in their neighborhood: the Holy Elm Tree of Auliyeagash. Auliyeagash, a village about 17 miles from Zharkent, is home to Kieli Agash, a holy tree (“Agash” means “tree” in Kazakh) rumored to be at least 700 years old. The number seven is key to the tree’s power. You may hear that the tree is 700 years old, that it sprang from seven roots, and that it takes seven people joining hands to encircle the tree. Legends about the tree abound. According to one tale, a Muslim pilgrim once went to sleep under a dead, brown tree but when he awoke, the plant was alive and green. Other stories state that water springing from the roots of the tree is healing, that a visit to the tree cures infertility, and that somehow the tree saved people from invading troops led by Genghis Khan. If you are able to ask locals about these legends, you absolutely should—just don’t expect the stories to be totally consistent. The approach to the tree is from the entrance arch, via a wooden walkway through a small park full of other, much younger, trees. Those trees are all bent over, many seemingly bending towards the main tree. Believers say this is because the smaller trees are all bowing to the older tree. Nearing the tree you will see handkerchiefs and scraps of fabric tied to branches in tribute. At the bottom of the trunk, which may be swaddled in white fabric, is a hole filled with purported holy water, which people drink either for their physical or spiritual health. The main attraction has undergone some rather severe trimming in recent years, in an effort to keep the rest of the tree alive and healthy. But even if the tree itself is a bit smaller than it once was, the park is quite peaceful and beautiful and the importance of the tree to the local community is very touching.  The village of Auliyeagash can be found by heading west from Zharkent towards Almaty and then turning right at Koktal, which takes you north towards Auliyeagash. Not far past the village you can find the entrance to the park marked with some metal railings and a small entrance arch. Colored pieces of fabric are tied to the gate, left by past pilgrims.  Frankly, even with the best directions and great GPS, this might be a little hard to find without some help from locals. Fortunately, literally everyone in the area knows about the holy tree. Work out how to pronounce Auliyeagash and, as a back up, how to say tree in Russian (“derevo”). Then find a local to ask any time you worry you’ve lost your way or just want to check that you’re still headed in the right direction.",superstitions legends trees plants
170,ALZHIR,"Malinovka, Kazakhstan",A Stalinist prison camp for the wives and children of men accused of betraying the Soviet state is now a memorial museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alzhir,"In the midst of Kazakhstan’s steppe is a former Stalinist prison camp, where a memorial complex and museum now candidly pay respect to those who suffered at the hands of the totalitarian Soviet state—in particular, the wives of the men who were accused of betraying the motherland. Visitors to Kazakhstan’s capital city, Astana, will revel in the Vegas-like atmosphere of gleaming new buildings dominated by shimmering gold and blue glass and metal. Sightseers might marvel at the height and design of the Emerald Towers, gazing at the impossibly futuristic skyline along the way to visit the top of the iconic Baiterek Tower and take in an unlikely panorama of the Central Asian steppe. Astana also has a much darker history lurking on the fringes of the affluent power hub. In the 1930s in the town of Akmol, about 20 miles west of Astana, Joseph Stalin established a special gulag named the “Akmola Labor Camp for the Wives of the Betrayers of the Homeland,” more commonly known by its Russian acronym, ALZHIR. The camp imprisoned women and children whose only crime was to be related to a man who had been denounced by the state, often for no discernible reason. In this Kafkaesque setting, the prisoners toiled at producing clothes and materials for soldiers fighting in World War II. Summers here experience temperatures approaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit while in winter, the mercury can sag to less than 40 below, and camp conditions were hardly sufficient to accommodate the climate. Remarkably, Kazakhstan’s officials do not attempt to obscure this dismal heritage, but rather have built and promoted a museum to commemorate those who suffered and died at ALZHIR.  A historic rail transport, reconstructed guard tower, and multiple sculptures surround the uniquely designed museum, which contains numerous relics and related stories that recount the painful details of prison life.  The biographies of those who survived are a true testament to the strength of the human spirit.  Sadly, as the exhibits demonstrate, too many women’s stories ended in tragedy. The museum is about 20 miles southwest of Astana and is largely accommodating for English only speakers.",prisons soviet history women memorials

172,KarLag Memorial Museum,"Dolinka, Kazakhstan",A sober museum housed in the original administrative building of one of Stalin's largest gulags.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karlag-memorial-museum,"In the village of Dolinka, outside of the large Kazakh city of Karaganda, is the former administrative headquarters of KarLag, short for the Karaganda Corrective Labor Camp, one of Stalin’s largest gulags. The attractive architecture belies the dark history of the building, which now houses a museum memorializing the victims of political repression all over, and the Soviet gulag system particular. In its nearly three decades of operation between 1931 and 1959, the administrative center at KarLag processed as many as one million prisoners. Soviet policy was to send people convicted of crimes (real or imagined) out of their home regions where they might generate sympathy among locals. So most of the prisoners housed in KarLag were not Kazakhs. In the years of World War II and immediately after, the Soviet labor camps were filled with either prisoners of war or simply people of German and, to a lesser extent, Japanese ethnicity who were rounded up and imprisoned. Consequently, the local population of the city of Karaganda was largely ethnically German until the late 20th century. While the vast Kazakh steppe provided a prison with little need for walls or fences (you can’t escape if there’s nowhere to escape to) the main reason for situating the Karaganda Corrective Labor Camp in this district was the need for cheap labor for local coal mines. This was especially crucial during wartime. Over time the labor performed here expanded from coal mining to agriculture, railroad engineering, and various scientific work. Famous residents included aircraft designer Andrey Tuplev and scientist Alexander Chizhevsky, who were expected to continue their work within the confines of prison. The administrative building includes two floors and a basement. In the basement are recreations of rooms that did not exist in this specific building, but did exist elsewhere in the gulag system: prison cells, medical clinics, torture rooms, and barracks. In the upper floors are themed rooms featuring artifacts and dioramas that tell the stories of life in the camps. Standout features include the many Soviet propaganda posters and the small gallery of art created by prisoners. Unsurprisingly, the subjects deemed appropriate for artistic expression are limited, and feature a lot of images of Vladimir Lenin. Most of the camp’s records were deliberately or “accidentally” destroyed, but a local university continues to work on piecing together the history of the prison. A ledger is provided for visitors to add their contact information and any information they have about relatives who might have been imprisoned here. If the research team finds any information about the prisoner, they will reach out.  Budget and hour or two to see the full museum. Many of the exhibits are labeled in Russian, Kazakh, and English, but if you hire a guide you are likely to get more out of the visit as they can share additional stories and context. Tours often leave from Karaganda and include transport, admission, and a guide. If you prefer to go solo, you can negotiate with a taxi driver for round trip driving and wait time while you tour the museum. A fair price is between 5,000-10,000 tenge. Those interested in even more history of the gulag system should visit ALZhIR, just outside the capital city of Astana (now renamed Nur-Sultan).",war memorial prisons soviet history war history world war ii memorials military museums

Inside the park, there’s a memorial to fallen Soviet soldiers that’s based on that famous (if not entirely truthful) story of heroic sacrifice. At one end of a long black plinth is an eternal flame dedicated to fallen soldiers of the Russian Civil War and World War II. At the other end is a black stone memorial, with the stoic faces of soldiers from all 15 Soviet Republics. Emerging at the front of the statue is a single soldier with arms spread up and out as if in flight, one hand wielding a fist full of grenades. According to official Soviet history, on November 16, 1941, the Red Army’s 316th Rifle division took a heroic last stand on the road to Moscow. The 28 infantrymen, named the “Panfilov” division after their commander, held their ground and destroyed 18 German tanks, buying precious time for the defenders of Moscow to get into position. As the Nazis rolled closer, company political officer V.G. Klochkov called to his comrades, “Russia is a great land, but there is nowhere to retreat—Moscow is behind us!” and hurled himself under an oncoming tank with an armful of grenades. All 28 men died, the last in a military hospital, where he recounted the details of the battle before succumbing to his wounds. A journalist for the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper put the story on the front page and it took hold across the Soviet Union, inspiring patriotic songs and poems. However, the military prosecutor’s office was forced to open a special investigation after two of the martyrs were discovered to still be alive. The investigation found that the entirety of the Krasnaya Zvezda’s story had been fabricated. There had been no last stand and the dramatic quotes were invented. However, the 1948 memo was not released to the general public until 2015, and by then the story was well entrenched as a national myth. Even in the wake of the memo disproving the story, a movie based on the story came out in 2016—and the man in charge of the national archives, which released the memo, was fired. Reactions to the story are split. After the 2015 release of the document disproving the story, the minister of culture denounced the head archivist for reinterpreting history. While some deride the story’s mythological place in Russian culture, others defend it as a parable about the sacrifices of the Red Army during World War II. Regardless - the statue is a monument to the heroism of the Red Army in one of the Soviet Union’s darkest hours. The statue is located in Panfilov Park, on Gogol Street, in central Almaty. It’s close to the beautiful Ascension Cathedral and the Kazakh Museum of Folk Musical Instruments. It is easily accessible on foot or by public transport.  The statue is located east of the  Zenkov Cathedral in Panfilov Park. The public park is open 24/7. There are several other monuments and sculptures to explore within the park.",communist monuments soviet history war history world war ii military statues

They are, after all, the gateway to the sky. But the Atyrau Airport in Kazakhstan is a bit different, as its low elevation is what sets it apart from the rest. The international airport, located 72 feet below sea level, is the lowest commercial airport in the world. It’s located on the grassy, flat stretches of land that surround the city of Atyrau. Atyrau Airport is one of five international airports in all of Kazakhstan. It’s near the Caspian Sea, which is the planet’s largest enclosed inland lake and contains a robust amount of oil beneath the seafloor. The airport plays a vital role in the local economy because it’s close to some of the country’s major sites for oil exploration. An oil company called KazMunayGas primarily uses the airport, though it still serves commercial traffic. The city of Atyrau is home to a high density of oil and construction companies. The airport is located around five miles from its outer limits.",airports aircraft airplanes lakes water
175,Balbals of Oskemen,"Ust'-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan",Stelae-eyed stones greet visitors to a corner of Kirov Park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balbals-of-oskemen,"The vast Eurasian steppe is peppered with collections of anthropomorphic stone memorials to ancestors, and some prime examples are tucked next to the Regional Museum of History and Folklore in Oskemen, Kazakhstan. These stone stelae carved with human faces, called balbals, have been produced since the Bronze Age, dating back some 5,000 years. They were used, in various forms, by many cultures including Scythian, Turkic, Mongolian, and Kazakh. Those found in Kazakhstan are not necessarily associated with burial sites (unlike the similar kurgan stelae), and although they are typically found facing westward, they have been discovered in a variety of contexts, presumably as symbols of veneration. The style of balbals altered with time and gradually became more detailed in the depiction of human faces and sartorial accoutrement, although their precise purpose remains a mystery. Scholars believe they may honor tribal leaders, lead the deceased to the upper world, or depict vanquished enemies. Some Kazakhstan locals believe the balbals have magical properties and still leave offerings for them. With the rise of Islam in Central Asia, the creation of balbals declined, as the religion has proscriptions against human representations. But examples still abound, projecting Kazakhstan’s ancient origins with stony silence.  The Regional Museum of History and Folklore is located within Kirov Park in the city of Oskemen (or Ust-Kamenogorsk in Russian).",burial places ancient memorials
176,Filles Dansantes,"Ridder, Kazakhstan",A statue of traditional Kazakh dancers adds some beauty to this Soviet-era mining city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/filles-dansantes,"Driving into the remote city of Ridder, it is easy to be distracted from the beautiful surrounding scenery of the Altai Mountains by the prolific decaying detritus from the city’s industrial history. But as the Soviet-era mining influences fade, public works of art, like the Filles Dansantes (Dancing Girls), mark a gradual rebirth. This statue depicting three traditional dancers represents the essentials of Kazakh culture. They wear traditional dress including the distinctive saukele, tall hats with a name that translates to “sunny head.” They caper beneath a shanyrak, an iconic national Kazakh symbol. The shanyrak is the cross-section found at the top of yurts (the traditional Kazakh dwelling) and represents family, home, strength, and well being. The three dancers pay homage to Kazakh numerology, in which three indicates completeness and engenders a host of respected trinities including the Three Virtues, Three Kinds of Happiness, and Three Inescapable Truths. The sculpture is also a reminder that traditional Kazakh dance has experienced a resurgence since independence in 1991. The Kara Zhorga (“black horse”) dance in particular has become popular. Although originally a dance for men that derived many movements from the art of riding horses, and deliberately employed farcical gyrations, women often perform this dance, but with distinctly more elegant choreography. The statue’s grace belies Ridder’s rougher founding by a Russian-German military officer in 1786. When Philip Ridder stumbled upon rich mineral deposits, the new settlement was named “Riddersky Pit.” World famous for its metallurgy in the 19th century, the city was rebranded by the Soviets as Leninogorsk in 1941. Mining interests plumbed the nearby depths for lead, which was found in such abundance that more than 50 percent of the USSR’s supply came from Leninogorsk. Today, zinc rather than lead galvanizes the city’s economy. The city was renamed Ridder in 2002, and a short distance from Filles Dansantes is another monument with a lump of ore sitting atop a plinth bearing Philip Ridder’s likeness in honor of this event.  Driving into Ridder is perhaps the best way to reach this city, located approximately 70 kilometers from the Russian frontier. Isolated as it may seem, it is the terminus of the E40, Europe’s longest motorway route.",dancing mining soviet history statues art
177,Ust-Kamenogorsk Lock,"Ust'-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan",Tucked away along a riverbend in an area known for its uranium mines is one of the world's tallest locks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ustkamenogorsk-lock,"An enormous dam may disrupt the river, but it doesn’t stop boats from sticking to their course. The world’s tallest regularly working lock sends vessels plunging 131 feet downward, letting them complete their journeys. Ust-Kamenogorsk (Oskemen in Kazakh), capital city of East Kazakhstan, lies at the confluence of the Irtysh and Ulba rivers in a region that borders Russia, Mongolia, and China. An industrious mining city, it’s known for being the Soviet Union’s primary ammunition production site and for its significant uranium output. The more than 300,000 people who live in the area, along with massive industrial enterprises, rely on power generated from a hydroelectric station on the Irtysh that’s home to the world’s tallest regularly used lock. Carrying voyagers around the power plant, the lock drops an impressive 131 feet. Keen observers will note the Three Gorges Dam in China has a lock with the same height; however, whereas Ust-Kamenogorsk regularly uses its lock, the Three Gorges only employs its lock in extreme circumstances, giving Ust-Kamenogorsk preeminence in the record books. The facility gained worldwide notoriety when Georgy Malenkov, temporary successor to Joseph Stalin as head of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party, arrived to take over management of the dam. This followed his exile to Kazakhstan by Nikita Khrushchev, who was irked by Malenkov’s attempted coup in 1957. In 1994, following Kazakhstan’s independence in 1991, the United States military conducted Project Sapphire here to liberate more than 1,300 pounds of enriched uranium after Kazakhstan volunteered to give up its nuclear stockpile. Tourists looking for souvenirs may prefer to seek out samples of the local honey, the famous regional delicacy, which does not require a military convoy to take home. The lock and hydroelectric dam are not equipped for visitors, and although it can be easily reached along the Ostrovskogo Road, there are no facilities for parking or other conveniences. Locals can be seen crossing the property over concrete barriers and through holes in fences to gain access to dachas on the opposite side, and no one seems bothered by the occasional curious sightseer wandering about.",canals dams engineering rivers infrastructure transportation water
178,Stronger Than Death Monument,"Semey, Kazakhstan",This 100-foot tall tombstone memorializes victims of 40 years of nuclear testing in Kazakhstan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stronger-than-death-monument,"Designed by Shota Valikhanov and erected on an island in the Irtysh River 2002, the “Stronger than Death” monument recalls Kazakhstan’s history as the fourth largest nuclear power by capacity and its leaders’ astonishing willingness to eventually give up that massive power. From 1949 to 1989, nearly 500 nuclear tests were conducted at the Semey site known as “The Polygon,” but following independence in 1991, the first President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, decided to end the nation’s nuclear programs by signing the START I treaty.  Unfortunately, the fallout from such extensive testing continues to this day as attested by this giant monument. The terror of the monument’s mushroom cloud silhouette is punctuated by the marble centerpiece of a mother protecting her child while overhead, a giant atomic model hangs like a sword of Damocles. The true number of nuclear testing victims can never be known since elevated radiation has been recorded throughout Kazakhstan and its neighbors, but at least one million people in the Semipalatinsk region have been affected. The tragedy of Kazakhstan’s nuclear history is perhaps mitigated somewhat by its advocacy for nuclear disarmament. The first major anti-testing campaign, known as Nevada Semipalatinsk, was popularly organized in 1989 and led directly to the shutdown on the Polygon. Nazarbayev followed this with the establishment of the ATOM project (“Abolish Testing Our Mission”) in 2012, which organized an international coalition to combat nuclear proliferation. Today, the honorary ambassador for this program is Karipbek Kuyukov, an award-winning Kazakh painter born without arms as a result of exposure to radiation from the Semey site.",nuclear memorials monuments
179,Tash Rabat,"At-Bashi District, Kyrgyzstan",Extremely isolated Silk Road caravanserai in the middle of nowhere.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tash-rabat,"Today, we picture the caravans traveling along the Silk Road from China to the Middle East as a rather romantic image. This romanticized portrayal conceals the real dangers that the journey included, since the Silk Road crossed some of the most inhospitable regions imaginable, and many travelers died en route. Unlike its name suggests, the Silk Road was not a single route, but a connection of several established tracks, each with its own fair share of threats. Caravanserais were an extensive network of traveler’s inns along old caravan roads, either located at cities along the way or as outposts of civilization in isolated regions, providing shelter from the hostile natural environment and from bandits. Travelers who reached Tash Rabat have already crossed the dangerous Torugart Pass, giving them the chance to recharge their energy for the next leg of the journey through the Tian Shan Mountains, to pray for a safe passage and to restock on food and water. Some historians argue that Tash Rabat may have been a Christian or Buddhist monastery before it was turned into a caravanserai, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The legend says that it was built by father and son. As they were building cupola on the roof, the son heard a caravan coming from afar. The father asked him to stay so they could finish the work. But the son went to greet the caravan and fell in love with traveling girl. He left his father, who was so sad that he didn’t finish the cupola and left few holes in it. Inside the caravanserai there is little to experience except wandering aimlessly through the dark corridors which are lit only by small openings in the roofs. These damp corridors and rooms, which include a well, a dungeon and a mosque, are extremely atmospheric, especially since it is not unlikely that the few visitors to the site may have the place entirely to themselves. Silk Road caravanserais can still be found all along the former Silk Road from Central China to the Mediterranean Coast. What makes Tash Rabat stand out among the myriad of caravanserais, is its isolated location in a meditative landscape, which gives a good sense about how difficult and dangerous travel along the remote parts of the Silk Road must have been. Even today, with modern 4WD vehicles and navigation systems, venturing out here is anything but straightforward. Snow blocks the road, which connects it with the nearest settlement, At-Bashy, for up to eight months a year. Even without snow blocking the road, constant landslides and avalanches, not to mention regular earthquakes and floodings often turn the road into a mere suggestion. Therefore, the road leading to Tash Rabat should under no circumstances be tackled without a local driver. Altitude sickness is another threat, which should not be taken lightly, since the caravanserai is located at a height of 3,500 meters. If a sudden change in road conditions make a return journey impossible, yurt camps in the vicinity of Tash Rabat can provide shelter. To the East, the road continues to the Torugart Pass border post with China, one of the most notoriously unpredictable borders in Asia, which is reputedly more often closed than it is opened, and where crossing the border can include several days of wait.",cultures and civilizations ruins architectural oddities architecture
180,Muzey Sulayman Too,"Osh, Kyrgyzstan",An outstanding piece of retro Sci-Fi architecture built into a sacred mountain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/muzey-sulayman-too,"With a bonnet-like facade protruding from the face of a cliff along a sacred mountain, this location would have been the perfect setting for a Bond villain, if Soviet movie makers had made the Russian equivalent of Bond movies, or perhaps a settlement on a newly discovered planet in the Star Trek series. Muzey Sulayman Too (also spelled Sulaiman-Too) is housed within a combination of natural and human-made caves that accommodate a total of 13 exhibition rooms. The museum is unique in that the building is just as—if not more—interesting than the exhibits in it. On display are a mismatch of natural and archaeological items, along with a handful of religious artifacts that border on new-age spirituality. Ancient pots, a modern statue of the Buddha, stuffed animals, plastic figures of a prehistoric human, black and white pictures from the Soviet era, and a chamber for spiritual healing sit incongruously (yet intriguingly) side by side. An overwhelming number of plastic chandeliers light the way for the visitors. Muzey Sulayman Too is actually the most recent evolution of this location, which was first used in 1949 to house the Museum of Local Lore. The museum in its current form opened in 2004, but the building as can be seen today was completed in 1978 to celebrate Osh’s 3,000th anniversary.  The museum is open from 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The museum offers great views of the city.",unesco caves ecosystems architectural oddities museums architecture

In the late 19th century, thousands of Chinese-Muslims fled across the Tien Shan Mountains to Central Asia after their failed rebellion against the ruling Qing Dynasty led to their exile. The arduous journey brought many to Karakol, then a wild frontier town of the Russian czar’s vast empire. Their descendants would become known as Dungans—“the people from the east”—and their cooking would become legendary. The mass exodus would leave the Dungan people in a state of permanent exile, but while they might have lost their homes, they never forgot their culinary traditions. Mamieva Hamida, the mother and head chef leads the preparation of Dungan dishes in her family home in Yrdyk, a center of Dungan culture on the outskirts of Karakol. She even shows guests how to prepare the most popular Dungan dish, ashlan fu. This cold-yet-spicy and revitalizing noodle soup survived war, exile, and the repression of the Soviet era to become a firm favorite in Kyrgyzstan. But before delving into the culinary world of the Dungans, guests are first taken to the local history museum in Yrdyk. Here they learn from enthusiastic amateur historians and storytellers the legends and myths of the Dungan people, and the dramatic story of their exile from China to Kyrgyzstan. The family then serves up a feast for their hungry guests in their living room. A long table is set in the middle of the wide room, and the smell of home cooking wafts through from the adjacent kitchen. Chopsticks are placed alongside knives, forks, and spoons, as a family member pours out steaming hot tea as the food begins to be served. A Dungan Feast comprises at least eight different dishes, and it’s a delectable fusion of cuisines. There are Central Asian–style manti dumplings, Chinese-inspired sweet-and-sour dishes, and bowls of pelmeni that would be more at home in a Russian canteen than in a Dungan family home. The fusion of all these flavors, spices, and styles demonstrates more than anything the tale of Dungan exile from China, and the establishment and integration of their communities in Central Asia.  The Dungan Family Restaurant of Mamieva Hamida is located in the village of Yrdyk, a short drive from the city of Karakol. It's right around the corner from the village history museum. If you're hungry for history and Dungan food, then you'll need to book a spot in advance through the local tourism office.",fusion foods immigration restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars

Specifically, it is the giant head of cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. While the giant face of the first man to journey into outer space, complete with cosmonaut helmet, is carved directly from solid rock, the story behind its creation is less certain. It seems that Yuri visited the area just shortly after his historic spaceflight. He may have even stood on this very rock. At which point, everyone was so psyched about the whole first man in space thing, the boulder was promptly carved into his likeness. Later, in a meta tribute to the first monument, a second more standard bust was erected. A local rumor has an more whimsical version of the rock’s origin. The rumor says that this was in fact where Yuri touched down, a fact which was covered up by the USSR because it was nowhere near the intended landing spot. While almost certainly untrue (Yuri did eject from his capsule landing near the village of Smelovka, in the Ternovsky District) it makes for a wonderful origin story. While unconfirmed this may in fact be a recreation of the first big Yuri rock head, which is said to have been broken up and smeared with concrete after the fall of the Soviet Union. This newer restoration is said to have been paid for by Moscow.The monument can be found driving up the gorge from Barskoon into the mountains.",cosmonauts monuments

But for the few Western visitors that make it to Bishkek, the real draw is the weird Soviet memorabilia. Lenin is omnipresent in the shrine-like room of the Kyrgyz Soviet Revolution on the upper floor, where his conterfeit – alongside Mikhail Frunze, Kyrgyzstan’s own leading communist – can be seen on porcelain vases and on traditional Kyrgyz rugs. Soviet flags adorn the ceiling and the walls of the hall, and the Hammer and Sickle symbol can be found anywhere. Then there are the highly bizarre murals – rather unusual depictions of Soviet propaganda, since they were not created during the heyday of Soviet propaganda displays, but only shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The style is unique, since it forms a transition from typical Soviet propaganda to modern art. Arguably, the most grotesque mural depicts former US President Ronald Reagan, riding Dr. Strangelove-style on a Pershing, wearing a mask of a grinning skull, while being surrounded by people demanding “No more Hiroshimas“. Additional bronze murals depict key events in communist and Soviet history, among others, Marx and Engels speaking to the people, Lenin inspiring the masses, the October Revolution and the burning tsarist palaces. Sooner or later, the Soviet pieces will likely be removed from the museum, but for now they still remain in place. Update February 2021: The museum is currently being renovated and is closed to the public. The murals have been removed.  As of November 2015, the museum is undergoing a renovation, which may very well include painting over these amazing murals. No amount of begging or attempted bribery will gain one access.

184,Merzbacher Lake,"Ak-Su, Kyrgyzstan",Glacial lake that mysteriously empties itself every year.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/merzbacher-lake,"A strenuous multi-day trek is necessary to reach Merzbacher Lake, a lake so far away from anything, that even the label “remote” would be an understatement. The lake is located at the confluence of the Inylchek Glacier in one of the most inaccessible regions of the Tian Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan. Even in a country like Kyrgyzstan, so blessed with stunning natural scenery, Merzbacher Lake is truly outstanding. Every spring, when the frozen lake melts, the lake’s waters lap at the tongue of the glacier and successively breaks off chunks of ice. The lake filled with drifting icebergs is a spectacular sight, but that is not all there is to Merzbacher Lake. The lake constitutes a phenomenon known as a proglacial lake, a lake dammed by a glacier. Proglacial lakes are found in various locations all over the world, but usually they enlarge until the glacier retreats, or are short-lived in their existence. Merzbacher Lake however, is highly exceptional since the lake repeatedly gets emptied, just to get refilled soon after. The process, still not fully understood by geologists, can be described like this: the melt water fills up the lake in the summer months at a rate of up to two meters per day. When the lake is filled, it bursts out and completely empties itself within just three days. The release of the water occurrs when the dam of ice buoys upwards and opens up a number of glacial channels in the damming glacier. The water then discharges through the glacier into the valley on the other side of the ice, where it flows into the Inylchek River. When the lake has emptied, the ice dam lowers, thereby blocking the glacial channels. As a result, the lake begins to fill up again. The cycle of the emptying and subsequent refilling of the lake occurrs at least once per year, in some years even twice. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to estimate the timing when the emptying begins. It usually takes place in August, but in some years it has occurred as early as Mid-July. Because of the difficult estimate to reach the lake at the right time, so far only very few people have witnessed the phenomenon.",geological oddities natural wonders water geology nature

Unlike many structures of its kind, the Bishkek Circus still functions as an actual circus to this day. In fact, this architectural gem is a testimony to the role that the circus played in the Soviet Union. Due to the lack of official records, it is all but impossible to pinpoint when the first circus appeared. Itinerant acts consisting of proto-clowns and musicians called skomorokhy wandered the Russian land in the 11th century, and they used to combine music, magic performance, dancing, and slapstick humor. They were more akin to street performers than to the circus, but the seeds were planted, and very soon, show booths began appearing where the audience was treated to trapeze and gymnastic stunts. The year 1877 saw the opening of the first stationary circus, in St. Petersburg. The target audience was the Russian aristocracy, which did not fail to embrace the daredevils that performed at the circus. After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the aristocracy was abolished and the circus was nationalized and transformed into a high art form comparable to ballet and opera. Under the aegis of the Soviet regime, circus acts like The Moscow Circus gained global recognition. Stationary structures purpose-built for the circus became common in all major Soviet cities, including Bishkek.",ufos circus soviet architecture soviet history architectural oddities architecture

Karakol is a town located on the South-Eastern shore of Issyk-Kul Lake in Kyrgyzstan. Founded in 1869 as a Russian military station, the town grew over time to become the fourth largest city in the country. Karakol soon became a popular year-round destination because of its ski slopes in winter and beautiful lakeshore and hikes available in the summer. In the 1800s, a group of Chinese Muslims—known as Dungans—fled political unrest in China and arrived at Karakol. The arrival of the Dungans diversified the Karakol community and injected the culture with elements of Chinese tradition and architecture. In 1904, a Dungan man named Ibrahim Aji commissioned the building of the mosque that was eventually named after the Dungan ethnic group. Ibrahim Aji conscripted Chou Seu, an architect based in Beijing, and twenty master carvers to build a mosque following two principal guidelines: the design had to conform to the Chinese architectural tradition, and it had to be built with no nails. These requirements resulted in a mosque that exhibits ingenious ways of carving and assembling each component of the building. It took six years to construct the mosque, which is held up by 42 main pillars topped by a three-tiered wooden frame. The result is a mosque that looks remarkably like a Chinese Buddhist temple, which testifies to the pre-Islamic history of the Dungan community. The color blue prevails, but yellow and red elements also stand out.  These colors are highly symbolic in the Dungan tradition. All along the perimeter of Dungan Mosque, the beams are decorated with colorful images of plants and fruit. Dungan Mosque was spared by Soviet purges, which destroyed the other eight mosques in Karakol, but the building was repurposed as a storehouse between 1929 and 1947. Following the end of WWII, Dungan Mosque was handed back to the Dungan community, which ensured the upkeep of the building to this day. Dungan Mosque is now the only example of Chinese architecture in Karakol and it is a registered historical building protected by Kyrgyz law.  The entrance to the mosque on on Bektenova street, a fairly short walk from the center of Karakol. Women can get robes at the entrance to the mosque, so they can dress casually throughout the rest of the day. A common and affordable way to travel around Kyrgyzstan is by public transportation, known locally as marshrutkas. Much like a standard bus, marshrutkas have designated routes that pick up and drop off passengers along the way. Karakol can best be reached from the capital city of Bishkek by either marshrutkas (five to six hours travel time) or by flight. The closest airport is Tamchy (IKU) near Lake Issyk-Kul.

This is Aalam Ordo, a failed project initiated under a president long gone. Constructed in 2009, Aalam Ordo was supposed to be a center for culture, science and spirituality. The vision behind the project was grand. This would be a place where the Kyrgyz youth would meet elders to exchange ideas and learn without lectures, curriculum, or lessons. The community would live in 365 yurts, 36 of which were designated for the elders. The hope was that this would foster and develop a new generation whose ideas could reach faraway countries and bring a Nobel Prize to Kyrgyzstan. Unfortunately, Aalam Ordo never became the renowned cultural center it was intended to become. In 2010, then-president Kurmanbek Bakiyev was removed from power in the Second Kyrgyz Revolution. The project was never completed, and the complex sits empty now, a mysterious ruin slowly being taken over by nature. Colorful murals and statues can be found throughout the complex. The art features traditional Kyrgyz motives like eagles and hawks, and also events from recent history. One of the murals depicts a dragon terrorizing a village, stealing all its riches. One by one the men in the village go to fight the dragon and finally one of them succeeds; but instead of returning to the village with all his riches, he himself turns into a dragon that continues to terrorize the village. This symbolizes the cycle of corruption in Kyrgyzstan, and how those fighting it have become just as corrupt once they were part of the system.

190,Kojomkul Memorial,"Kojomkul, Kyrgyzstan",An unusual monument to a gentle giant who became a Kyrgyz hero.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kojomkul-memorial,"Kojomkul was a seven-and-a-half-foot tall Kyrgyz giant who weighed over 350 pounds and was reportedly able to lift and carry a full-grown horse. In another demonstration of his incredible strength, he reputedly once lifted a 1,500-pound boulder. Born in 1889 in a small village called Suusamyr, he became a sensation of his time by winning each and every wrestling and strength competition along the Silk Road. Feats of strength aside, Kojomkul’s many good deeds earned him a “gentle giant” reputation. He gained widespread respect for donating sheep and horses won in competitions to villagers in need, which would explain why after his death in 1955, the village was eventually named after him. A small museum in town houses a collection of Kojomkul’s belongings and some pictures of him lifting heavy weights. At the outskirts of Kojomkul village is an unusual monument dedicated to the memory of Kojomkul the hero. It consists of a mud building in the shape of a yurt covered by a rickety wooden shelter. Sightings of these wooden shelters are not uncommon, but they are usually no bigger than an average umbrella and are fixed in tombstones, whereas the one in Kojomkul is much larger, and it encompasses the whole mud-yurt. Along one of the poles radiating from the sustaining pillar, people have tied several cloths as a tribute to Kojomkul’s superhuman strength.  The memorial is located just beyond the village on the road to Kyzyl-Oi. There is also a statue and museum honoring the local hero within the village itself. A wooden pillar set in the center of the yurt sustains the whole structure, but huge cracks in the upper sections of the yurt suggests that sooner or later, the ceiling will cave in if structural reinforcement is not put in place.",wrestling giant competitions sports memorials history
191,Min Kush,"Ming-Kush, Kyrgyzstan","This village was once a thriving Soviet uranium mining center, but is now semi-abandoned and desolate.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/min-kush,"Min Kush, which means “a thousand birds” in Kyrgyz, was formally established in 1955 as an industrial town built around a uranium mine. At its peak, the population reached around 20,000. After the fall of the Soviet Union and closure of the mine, it dropped to just 2,000. Today the impoverished village is deteriorating; many buildings are empty and boarded up, and radiation levels can reach 10 times higher the norm. While some coal mines are still active, the majority of residents are unemployed, living on small pensions leftover from the town’s glory days. While houses in most villages are usually built for a single family and rarely surpass two floors, the buildings in Min Kush are at least three or four times bigger. Some were actually flat-blocks, while others were probably used for administration. Now, they look rundown, but once upon a time they must have been stunning. Some of these buildings were completely abandoned, and are crumbling and overgrown with vegetation. Further uphill is a mining center. It is cordoned off, but it is obvious that someone is using these facilities as animal shelters, and sections of the surrounding land were actually cultivated. A semi-buried building bears the date 1955 on its facade. Another building has huge, deep holes in its floor. Other buildings are simply locked. Beyond the boundaries on the town, there are four radioactive mill piles. The biggest pile, Tuyuk-Suu, is located in a valley, and two canals were built to divert a stream running in the middle to avoid contamination. Lack of maintenance has led to water trickling over the canals, making the whole area unsafe. The other three piles are also in dire need of maintenance. Cows, sheep and goats graze freely in the meadows surrounding the piles.  Min Kush is potentially dangerous to visit. Certain areas are marked with red warning signs depicting radiation, a skull, and (curiously) a human figure running. Other areas are cordoned off. Set deep in the Min Kush Valley, along the Min Kush River, the road to the village is bumpy, muddy, and dangerous, and with very little traffic. Although there is public transport, it is not obvious how often and when it comes by. A safer option to reach Min Kush is by a 4x4 vehicle. There is a camping site near the village, but with basic facilities.",soviet history mines abandoned
192,Jeti-Ögüz Rocks,Kyrgyzstan,"According to myth, there's a bloody explanation for the beautiful bright red color of this rock formation set amidst alpine vegetation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jeti-oguz-rocks,"Jeti-Ögüz is a bright red rock formation that lends its name to a nearby resort, a village, and a whole Kyrgyz district. To differentiate it from these other entities, the formation is sometimes referred to as Jeti-Ögüz Rocks or Jeti-Ögüz Canyon. The name of this protected natural monument in Kyrgyzstan translates as “Seven Bulls,” a reference a mythological dispute between two rival khans. The wife of one of the khans betrayed her husband to join the second khan. Conspiracies and subterfuges ensued, and the climax of the legend coincides with the slaughtering of seven bulls during a party in which the betrayed khan stabbed his wife to death. This caused a deluge of blood that covered the seven bulls, the khan, his servants and the surrounding mountains. Hence the bright red rock formation. For those unsatisfied with the mythological explanation for nature of the formation, these rocks consist of conglomerate of fragments of geological detritus. The oblique layering of these rocky protrusions is due to millions of years of sedimentation. In fact, these layers are more reminiscent of a dragon’s scales rather than bulls, and this resemblance probably did not go unnoticed, as the adjacent valley is called Ushchelie Drakanov (Valley of Dragons). A visit in the late afternoon will guarantee the brightest shade of red.  From the road running along Issyk Kul Lake, the directions for Jeti-Ögüz will lead to this stunning rock formation.  There is ample parking space nearby and an array of small shops selling snacks and trinkets.  Guides are available for hikes.",color rock formations rocks geology

In the Kyrgyz language, Saimaluu-Tash means “patterned/embroidered stone.” These works of rock art date back as far as 4,000 years ago, and were carved over time by a number of different groups. There are two areas with carved rocks. The longest one is more than three kilometers long and between the two there is a pond. The large galleries of petroglyphs appear to show scenes of hunting, shamanic rituals, and sexual intercourse, with a mystic meaning or for votive reasons. The oldest pieces are thought to date to the second or third century B.C., and new art was added into the Middle Ages. Archaeologists have found evidence of a settlement at the site from the eighth century B.C. to first century A.D. The Saka priests are believed to have used the site for sacrificial rites. The site was sacred to the people of Tien Shan and Pre Ferghana, and is even now sacred to the modern generation of Kyrgizians for spiritual and healing qualities. The area is reachable only in August by foot (six to eight hours of hard trekking) or horse (three to four hours) passing through fields of grass, woads, on the top of a glaciers in a constant ascent usually in a very small pathway.

The building is covered with images of common workers revolting against the privileged classes, Soviet soldiers, and the sickle and hammer symbol of Soviet Russia. The museum is dedicated to and named for a local hero of Bishkek, Mikhail Frunze. He was a leader during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, who later became a Major Red Army Commander. Although Frunze was not of Kyrgyz ethnicity, he was born in Bishkek to Russian and Romanian parents. He spent 10 years in a prison in Siberia, from which he escaped, and is most famous for the key role he played in the defeat of Baron Wrangel in Crimea in 1920. The building where the Frunze Museum is located was built after Frunze’s death, around the cottage where the revolutionary was born and raised. The museum’s three floors display all sorts of items from Frunze’s life: his uniforms and weapons, books he read, books he wrote, black-and-white pictures of Frunze with various Soviet figures and with his family, newspaper cut-outs reporting his military successes, and so on. Of note, there are several documents of Soviet propaganda, a large painting of Frunze with Lenin discussing military plans, a horse-drawn cart with a machine gun mounted on it, and a larger-than-life bronze statue of the Bolshevik leader.  The house is locked, but the museum staff will open it for visitors. It is fully furnished and the rooms are carefully cordoned off, but it is possible to walk through the corridor and take photos. Most of the informative signs are only  in Kyrgyz and Russian, but there is still plenty to see, making the museum a worthwhile visit for English speakers as well.",revolution soviet history museums and collections museums
195,Eki-Naryn Forest Swastika,"Tash-Bashat, Kyrgyzstan",The origin of this sinisterly shaped forest is rooted in mystery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ekinaryn-forest-swastika,"On the hillside outside of the village of Tash-Bashat grows a forest obviously shaped by a human hand. Even though it’s mirrored and some of the arms are incomplete, it’s still an unmistakable symbol. The origins of this forest swastika, which measures nearly 600 feet across, are unclear. As such, legends about its creation abound. One theory is that German prisoners of war planted the trees while in captivity after World War II. However, there’s no evidence to support this, despite the fact that 1.3 million German soldiers went missing within the Soviet Union and were forced to do labor. Locals living in the area claim that only Kyrgyz planters worked there and that the forest was planted in the ‘40s or ‘50s. Another theory is that the trees were planted in the 1940s by Kyrgyz workers under the instruction of a German Nazi sympathizer who had been exiled to Kyrgyzstan during the war. Others say that the trees were planted right after Stalin’s death in 1953, and still more claim they were planted in the ‘30s to symbolize the Soviet-German friendship at the time. There are even those claiming that the symbol is completely unrelated to World War II. This theory says the forest takes the shape of an ancient Hindu symbol used long before the Nazis came into power. But this proposal is clearly flawed, as the trees were planted sometime in the mid-20th century after the Nazis had already corrupted the symbol’s meaning within popular culture. Whatever the background of the Eki-Naryn forest swastika is, it keeps reminding people of the horrors of the 20th century and probably will as long as it exists.  The Eki-Naryn Forest Swastika is located outside of the village of Tash-Bashat in Kyrgyzstan.

The largest of them is located in the center of the valley, and shares a name with a nearby mountain pass. Known as San Tash, it is a four-meter-high mound with a diameter of 56 meters. The name San Tash means “counted stones.” The site is associated with the great commander and conqueror known as Tamerlane (sometimes called Timur). Legend holds that Tamerlane asked each of his soldiers to take a stone and drop it in that place, so he would have an idea of the size of his army. After the battle, he asked the soldiers to take back their stone to have an idea of the war casualties. The remaining pile of stones represented how many soldiers had died during battle.

The vibrant blue waters that flow down the falls travel down through a series of pools before rejoining the flow of the jungle river. After ages of flowing over the rocks, the falls have etched deep lines into the stone creating a beautiful travertine pattern. The pools are smaller near the top of the falls, but tend to widen out nearer to the bottom eventually becoming big enough to swim in should the tropical heat inspire someone to jump in as it often does. The locals (who charge a small fee to visitors to the falls) have built out a wooden platform that visitors can take in the rushing waters from, or even dive off of in some places. Reaching the Kuang Si Falls is a bit tricky as they are pretty far off the beaten path and require a willing driver or rental. However the ubiquitous tuk-tuk drivers in the nearby town of Lunag Prabang are generally willing to take anyone interested in traveling to the falls for a nominal (if negotiable) fee.

Kong Lor Cave, considered to be one of South Asia’s geological wonders, is definitely one of them. Karst limestone caves are particularly appealing due to their unusual rock formations, but Kong Lor is no ordinary limestone cave. In fact, it was formed by the Nam Hin Bun River running through an entire mountain, sculpting the rock along its way. Inside, there’s a pool of water with an emerald-tinted glow that locals believe is sacred. Visitors can hire a wooden boat and an experienced boatman who will negotiate the sprawling caverns. They’ll take you through massive passages with majestic stalactites and towering stalagmites. There are also narrow passages that require skills and intimate familiarity with the cave, the depth of the river, the strength of the currents, and, of course, the itinerary. Navigating the cave is usually performed in utter blackness, aided by only the feeble, flickering lights of headlamps. Kong Lor Cave is still used by villagers to transport goods and, if visited at the time of harvest, tobacco as well. Located in Khammouane Province, in the geographical heart of Laos,  it can be reached by following a rural road from Ban Khoun Kham or by taking a boat from Ban Naphouak.

201,Plain of Jars,"Phonsavan, Laos","Believed to have once stored either human remains or rice wine, thousands of mysterious stone jars lie in ruin.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plain-of-jars,"The Plain of Jars is a collection of large stone jars interspersed throughout the Xieng Khouang plain in the Lao Highlands. The stone structures are mostly made of sedimentary rock and, ranging from 3 to 10 feet in height (1 to 3 meters), each can weigh up to 14 tons. To date, the origin of the jars is unknown, though archaeologists believe that they were originally used between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. Many researchers have theorized that the jars may have once served as funerals urns or food storage. As local Laotian legend would have it, the jars were created by Khun Cheung, an ancient king of giants who lived in the highlands. It is said that Cheung, after fighting a long and victorious battle, created the jars in order to brew huge amounts of celebratory lao lao rice wine. The Plain of Jars received relatively little Western attention until the 1930s, when French archaeologist Madeleine Colani began surveying the area. Though previous reports of the jars had cited the existence of goods such as carnelian beads, jewelry, and axes, the site was mostly looted by the time Colani arrived. Despite this, Colani discovered a nearby cave housing human remains, such as burned bones and ash, leading her to believe that the jars were funeral urns for chieftains. Colani excavated the artifacts, some of which dated to between 500 BC and 800 AD, and published her findings in The Megaliths of Upper Laos. Though the Xieng Khouang plain remains the central site of the jars, similar clusters can be connected to form a linear path all the way to northern India. The existence of similar jar clusters in other parts of Asia also led to the belief that the jars were part of a large trade route. Some researchers believe that the jars collected monsoon rainwater for caravan travelers to use during dry season. Travelers would use the water and then leave behind prayer beads or offerings in the jars, thus explaining previous sightings of jewelry and assorted goods. Though the caretakers for the Plain of Jars are applying for status as a UNESCO World Heritage site, the area still remains one of the most dangerous archaeological sites in the world. Thousands of unexploded bombs remain from the Secret War of the 1960s, and some of these arms still cause injuries to this day. As such, only Sites 1, 2, 3 and the Quarry are open to visitors, while a number of organizations work to remove explosives and apply for more funding. Any visit to the jar sites takes one past numerous large bomb craters and crater clusters. Further adding to the area’s mystique, the many varied casings of these American bombs are used extensively to decorate houses and roadsides in nearby of Phonsavan, the provincial capital. Scrap metal collection is one of the major economic activities here. Researchers have traced the jars back to a quarry a few miles outside of Phonsavan.  The area was also used extensively during the war by the Pathet Laos (Lao Nation, the communist political movement) who hid in natural and human-made caves here in the quarry.  Many visitors fly to Phonsavan from Luang Prabang on one of the national airlines' small, propeller-driver passenger planes. The fare is cheap. Buses run daily from Vietiane, Vang Vieng, and Luang Prabang to Phonsavan; there used to be a local bus service, but it has ceased service and now the only shared motor transit out of Phonsavan are the 9AM minivans.The three main jar sites can be visited by jeep/taxi arranged through one of the guesthouses or tour companies, or by motorcycles, which are easy to rent in town. Note that of the 3 most commonly visited Jar Sites (named Site 1, 2, and 3, although there are over 40 Jar Sites in total) Site 1 is by far the busiest and most touristy, being closest to the city and containing a small museum; Laotians and foreign tourists alike can frequently be seen taking pictures or Facetiming friends and relatives while sitting on the jars. By contrast, one might very well pass half a day at Sites 2 & 3 without seeing anyone besides farmers and cows. If you hire a walking guide, they can take you on a hike of around 1 hour between Sites 2 & 3; this hike should not be attempted without a guide as it goes through the private yards and houses of local farmers. From Site 2 there is a lovely hiking trail through a pine forest- cleared of UXOs, though the trail is not always maintained- to a viewpoint on a hill.",megalithic unesco wine mystery burial places ancient ruins

Giant Buddhas lounge as Vishnu looks on, and Shiva menaces both with eight arms full of weaponry. In fact, the Xieng Khuan, or “Spirit City” park was built in 1958 by Luang Pu (translated as Venerable Grandfather) Bunleua Sulilat. Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat was a priest-shaman, myth-maker, mystic and sculpture artist with a large following in Laos and later in Thailand. Born into a family of eight children in Thailand Sulilat was supposedly mentored by a hermit named Keoku whom he met after falling in cave. Sulilat’s particular brand of mysticism integrated Hinduism and Buddhism and united the Thai and Laotian peoples. Later Sulilat was forced to flee from Laos to Thailand after the revolution in 1975. There, he built another sculpture park, Sala Keoku in Nong Khai. Xieng Khuan park was Sulilat’s first sculpture park and was built by the side of the Mekong River, about 25 kilometers from Vientiane. Said to have been built by himself and his students – all non-trained artists – the park is an astounding display of outsider artistry. The iconography is reflective of the imaginative the philosophy of this man, and closely resembles a south-east Asian interpretation of the mannerist gardens of 1600s Europe such as the Monsters of Bomazaro park, in Italy. The more than 200 statues, filled with cryptic symbols, concentrated in a small area give the Xieng Khuan park spot an aura of horror vacui fantasy. Among these ferro-concrete sculptures are skeleton thin Buddhas, a giant pumpkin with with a demon head for an opening and three floors representing Heaven, Hell and Earth as well as a gigantic 40 meter long reclining Buddha. Sadly, the place is about to fall into ruins because of floods from the Mekong River and a general lack of conservation. If it is now already a place of surreal lore that looks of ancient ruins, it will surely transform into something even stranger when it actually becomes ruins.

Among this multitude, two stand apart, renowned for their beautifully imperfect contents. Primarily a religious site, the Pak Ou Buddha Caves are located inside a steep rock face that droops over the sacred site like tobacco-stained teeth. Accessed by a brilliant white-washed, zigzagging staircase, the boats dock at the bottom and allow for pilgrims and tourists alike to ascend into the upper and lower caves for exploration. Once inside, visitors are met with thousands of statues of the Buddha. Ranging in size, quality, and material, the only factor uniting these effigies are their minor imperfections. Roam long enough, and you can spot each; some are missing hands and or have chipped faces, while others list to the side or were replaced by newer versions less love-worn from ages of devotion. Before their discovery by outsiders, the perfectly imperfect contents at Pak Ou’s caves were only considered on an annual basis; during the Laotian New Year, practitioners of the faith would come to bathe in the caves in hopes of receiving boons in the coming year. Now that the caves have become a semi-known tourist destination, boat operators hired to take visitors to the cave often make a detour on the way home for the Lao Lao “whiskey village.” Here visitors are offered the opportunity to sample the townsfolk’s famously potent home-brewed potables before continuing the ferry ride back to Luang Prabang, which doesn’t sound like such a bad idea since there’s a man paid to get you all home in one piece. By the end of your journey to Pak Ou, visitors will have washed back ashore in Luang Prabang having touched on every single holy facet of ancient and modern life in a single afternoon – beginning with a watery trek into a world populated with misfit deities made more holy for their outcast nature, only to then chase the experience with a physical and spiritual reunion with the living, all while being shuttled to and fro atop one of the most revered rivers in the world.

Kept in inhumane conditions, the illegally trapped bears would be repeatedly harvested so long as they could survive in their tiny cages. In addition, the animals are often poached to be used as food or even pets. Tragic origins aside, the bears at the rescue center lead a fulfilling life in the open enclosures that provide enough space and stimulation to keep the animals happy and healthy. Visitors to the refuge can stroll along the wooden paths and view the adorable (if grizzly) beasts as they lounge, play and generally look more cuddly than killer.

Apparently, today only a solitary monk by the name of Soubane inhabits the area. This plateau is also home to the jungle temple, Wat Dane Soung. The Wat Dane Soung is believed to have been built in the first millennium by the Mon, and features a number of Dvaravati-style Buddha images carved into the rock. Many of these images have been painted gold. In 1986 construction of a new temple began, but was never completed due to lack of funds. A few years later, in the early 1990’s, the Lane Xang Hotel built a restaurant on site in hopes of encouraging tourism. As local legend has it, the necessary ceremonies for appeasing the spirits were not performed, resulting in a fire that burned down the new building.

Yet, if you take your time to stop by the bridge over the Namkading River and look around, you may be able to spot some missile-like boats in the river. They are not missiles, but their shape is no coincidence, for they used to be fuel tanks on U.S. B-52 bombers, which dropped a massive amount of ordnance all over the region in the 1960s and ’70s, at the height of the Vietnam War. The high quality of this wartime scrap metal didn’t go unnoticed, and Tha Bak villagers started turning the spherical debris into boats—very, very durable boats. It is possible to pay to take a spin in one of these so-called bomb boats. Of note, northwest of Tha Bak is Nam Kading National Diversity Park, and Nam Kading River is a major entry point.  Bomb boats will probably be unable to go past the rapids, but up to that point, it can be an interesting ride.  The bomb boats are easily visible from the high bridge along Route 8 at Tha Bak.

It was completed in 1968, using funds donated by the United States – funds that were meant to be used for the construction of an airport. Patuxai, meaning Victory Gate in English (and variously written as Patuxay, Patousai and Patusai), was built between 1957 and 1968 in memory of the Laotian soldiers who died during World War II and the war of independence from France in 1949. It’s also known as the Arc de Triomphe of Vientiane due to its resemblance to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Patuxai, however, is slightly taller than its Parisian counterpart, has four gates rather than two, and is covered in distinctly Laotian designs. The exterior of the monument is decorated with traditional Laotian motifs, including Buddhist symbols, Hindu deities and female spirits of the clouds and waters known as apsaras. The ceilings beneath the four arches are decorated with further depictions of Hindu gods, such as Brahma and Vishnu, and mythological creatures like the mythical bird-woman Kinnaree and the three-headed elephant Erawan. On top of Patuxai, meanwhile, sit five towers, again built in the traditional Laotian style. Four of these are located on each corner of the monument, while a fifth rises up from the center, higher than the rest. These five towers are decorated with flower motifs and each is topped with a golden finial. Needless to say, the construction of the Patuxai monument was a costly project. The Laotian government, however, managed to fund the bulk of the effort with money donated from the United States – despite that money having been donated for an entirely different project. In the 1950s, the United States provided Laos with funds and a huge amount of concrete for the expansion of the city’s airport, which could then serve as a base for US fighter jets during the Vietnam War. But the funds and concrete arrived before any contract had been signed, so the Royal Laotian Government decided to build a massive triumphal arch, rather than an airport serving foreign interests. For this reason, locals jokingly refer to Patuxai by another name: the Vertical Runway. No mention of this is made on the sign attached to Patuxai. But the sign is strangely honest in other ways, stating that the monument was never actually completed due to the country’s turbulent history, and that “From a closer distance, it [Patuxai] appears even less impressive, like a monster of concrete.” Not a glowing appraisal, but refreshingly frank.  Patuxai is located along Lane Xang Avenue, within easy walking distance from downtown Vientiane (where most tourists stay). Visitors can climb the stairs that lead up through the seven stories inside the monument, passing through souvenir shops, a small museum and all the way to the top where the main viewing platform is located. Patuxai is open Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the weekend. The entrance is 3,000 kips (about $0.35 US).",
208,Tham Piew Cave,"Muang Kham, Laos",A tangible and sobering reminder of an atrocity that took place during a secret war.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tham-piew-missile-cave,"On November 24, 1968, a single rocket fired by a United States fighter plane made contact with this cave in Central Laos killing 374 men, women, and children. Tham Piew was a vast cave that served as a shelter for the local community seeking refuge from the bombing campaigns that were designed to contain the Marxist Pathet Lao. Today, Tham Piew is open to the public as both a memorial and a testament to a harrowing era in Laos history. There is a small interpretive center at the base of the mountain near the parking area that explains the significance of the site from a Laotian perspective. A visit to Tham Piew isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s a journey that should be undertaken with the utmost respect for the local community and the deceased buried in marked graves along the walkway to the cave. Visitors can also leave an offering with a Buddhist monk at the base of the steps to the cave in memory of the victims.  Just north of Muang Kham, follow the signs labeled Tham Piew.",caves war history memorials ecosystems military
209,Crocodile Stone,"Champasak, Laos",This mysteriously shaped boulder may have been used for human sacrifice in ancient times.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crocodile-stone,"In the Phou Khao Mountains of southern Laos lie the ancient ruins of Wat Phu, a Hindu temple of Khmer origins. Among the temple remains is a boulder with a very curious carving. The deep impression in the stone vaguely resembles a crocodile, but it could also easily accommodate a human body. It has been speculated that this stone may have been used as an altar to perform an annual human sacrifice in pre-Angkhor times. While most of the ruins of Wat Phu date to between the 11th century and 13th century, there is archaeological evidence that a temple existed at the site as early as the 5th century.  If human sacrifices were performed, they would date back to these earlier times, when southern Laos was ruled by the Chenla Empire. Oral tradition has it that once a year, when the frangipani petals started falling, the Chenla king would sit on the main causeway of Wat Phu. The king would pray to the spirits of the mountains and offer rice wine to two girls selected for their beauty. The girls would then be sacrificed to propitiate the gods’ favors for the coming year. To corroborate the veracity of this story, there is mention in the 6th-century History of the Sui that human sacrifice was performed annually in the Chenla culture, and the description of the ceremony matches the version in the local folklore. It may simply be a retelling of the description in the ancient text, but the fact that rural communities retained that specific tale through the centuries is significant. What is not known, however, is the role the Crocodile Rock played in this ceremony, if any. The uniqueness of carving makes it even more mysterious. Over the whole of Laos and Cambodia, nothing even remotely resembling the Crocodile Stone can be found in ruins from before, during, or after the Chenla Empire. Curiouser still, crocodiles did (and still do) exist in the area, but they didn’t have a religious significance. If the Crocodile Stone was not used for human sacrifice, the mystery remains: What was it for?  Wat Phou is about 6 miles (10 km) southwest of Champasak, the main town in the area. There is a museum at the archeological site, open daily from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.",empire gods rituals temples rocks ancient archaeology geology ruins animals
210,Vang Sang Buddhas,Laos,"A mysterious, hidden cluster of Buddha sculptures carved into the rocks.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vang-sang-buddhas,"On a road not far from Laos’ capital city of Vientiane is a handmade sign clearly different from the regular road signs. It does nothing to convey the hidden marvel it leads to. Secluded within the woods is a group of Buddha sculptures carved into the rock. Its name translates to “Elephant Palace” and references an elephant graveyard supposedly once discovered nearby. No one knows for sure when the mysterious sculptures were created, and guesses range from the 10th century to the 16th century. The biggest statues are about 10 feet high, but some smaller statues can be found in the surrounding area. If you look closely at the rocks, you’ll also notice less ornate carvings of Buddha practically hidden behind the greenery. Overgrown with vegetation, the whole shrine feels abandoned and forgotten, like it could be lost to time at any moment. The centuries-old figures are pale, their gold paint peeling and faded. The Buddhas all have peaceful, serene expressions that mirror the quiet, undisturbed atmosphere of the shrine. Heading North on Road no. 13, is a sign saying Van Xang. Follow the well-marked but dirt road besides it for a couple of miles until a cluster of boulders and heavy vegetation signals the end of the road.

Nowadays only the remains of these torched and decayed images remain. The mouth of the cave is outlined by a large stone block entrance accompanied by plumeria trees and two large ruined spirit houses, which were once a shelter of the cave’s spirits. The iron gate at the entrance is locked, but if you inquire with the monks at the nearby monastery, Wat Long Khun, they will unlock it for you and you can walk through the long, dark, damp cave.

212,Craters Restaurant,"Phonsavan, Laos",Eat a meal surrounded by bomb fragments.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/craters-restaurant,"Set on a major backpacking highway for Western tourists on the border between Laos and Vietnam, Craters definitely caters to its audience. There is everything on the menu, ranging from Asian specialties to American standbys like steak and pizza. Overall, Craters is not that remarkable as a restaurant. However, Craters is immediately set apart from other cheap eateries by the giant bomb shells flanking the patio seating. For those who visit without any knowledge of history, the decor seems a bit off-putting, but with a little background, begins to make sense. The city of Phonsavan was absolutely pummeled during the Vietnam War. The American military was convinced Vietcong were escaping the country into Laos through Phonsavan. In response, American forces dropped 500,000 missiles onto the surrounding area, making it one of the most bombed places in the world. In the aftermath of the war, people moved back to Phonsavan and began rebuilding, often using the remnants of bombs in their construction. Craters opened up, ironically to serve Western backpackers from the very country that left Phonsavan in ruins. Essentially, Craters is a kitschy exploitation restaurant, playing on the war-torn past of the city to either deliver a socially-conscious message, or bring in tourists desiring to be photographed in front of the restaurant.",disaster areas Unique Restaurants & Bars shops
213,COPE Visitor Centre,"Vientiane, Laos","In the world's most bombed country relative to its size, this incredible organization helps pick up the pieces.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cope-visitor-centre,"The Vietnam War is still heavily present in Laos, the country that experienced the most bombings by the American military. Between 1964 and 1973, the U.S. dropped two million tons of explosives on Laos, and the effect can still be felt today. Unexploded ordnance (UXO) riddle the landscape, and cluster bombs in particular continue to injure and kill many people in rural areas. The problem is so prevalent, an organization called COPE—short for the Cooperative Orthotic & Prosthetic Enterprise—was created to help with the recovery of the victims of bombs, by providing custom prosthetics, rehabilitative services, and education to rural communities affected by the bombs to attempt to prevent future accidents. To foreign visitors, particularly Americans, the COPE Visitor Centre is jarring and incredibly informative. The shadow war in Laos is clearly presented, complete with a sculpture of a dangling UXO right at the entrance. The “COPE” sign on the side of the building is created from used prosthetic feet. Dangling inside are dozens of worn-out prosthetic limbs, returned by bomb victims in exchange for new prosthetics. Outside the building is a statue of a mother and child created from discarded bomb materials. Inside, there’s a full-scale replica of a rural Laotian stilt house, with daily household items created out of military equipment (and occasionally bomb materials) discarded by American and European militaries. It highlights how families are utilizing bomb materials while not understanding the danger they can cause. Pictures and stories accompany the displays, putting names and faces to the many thousands of victims of the military campaign in Laos. If there is one place for foreigners to visit in Vientiane, this may be it. From their website: The Visitor Centre is located in Vientiane, Laos, in the grounds of the Centre for Medical Rehabilitation (CMR), on Khouvieng Road, across the street from the Green Park Hotel. From the entrance of the CMR grounds, follow the road in and turn right at the indoor stadium.

214,Wat Phia Wat,"Muang Khoun, Laos",This ruined temple's giant Buddha statue bears the scars of the Second Indochina War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phia-wat,"It is difficult to imagine that the diminutive village where Wat Phia Wat is located, Muang Khoun, used to be the capital of the Phuan Kingdom in the 14th century. Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese armies and looters ransacked Muang Khoun for centuries before the Second Indochina War broke out and the town was heavily bombed by the U.S. Air Force. Entire swathes of the town were razed to the ground, including a number of religious sites. Wat Phia Wat collapsed but, against all odds, the large Buddha statue sitting in the temple survived. What is now referred to as Wat Phia Wat is the compound enclosing both the new temple and the remains of the old one. The new temple is a modern run-of-the-mill Lao temple, and not much of the old temple has stood the test of time, with the notable exception of a Buddha statue. Of the old temple building, only the brick foundation and some pillars remain standing. This may not be the most beautiful Buddha statue in the country, and the bombing certainly did not help; the right cheek and lips are scarred, and one eye is missing. Yet, this statue mirrors the resilience that the local people demonstrated in the face of almost complete annihilation. Perhaps this is the reason why it is revered by worshippers, that can often be seen praying at the feet of the statue, burning incense and making offerings. A ceremonial sash drapes from the Buddha’s left shoulder to the opposing hip, and in its lap are several Buddha statuettes.  Muang Khoun is located about 18 miles (30 km) southeast of Phonsavan. The main road goes by Wat Phia Wat. If you’re coming from Phonsavan, you’ll see the ruins of a French colonial building upon entering the village. Wat Phia Wat is about 200 yards further along the main road.",buddha temples war history military statues ruins
215,Bamboo Bridges of Luang Prabang,"Luang Prabang, Laos",These bamboo and rope bridges cross the Nam Khan River for six months every year.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bamboo-bridges-of-luang-prabang,"Luang Prabang was named a UNESCO world heritage site for its well-preserved French colonial architecture, but its true charms spring from the Lao culture. The streets are filled with Saffron-robed monks, local handicrafts, Buddhist temples, and hawker stalls selling river fish and sticky rice. Visitors flock to the old town’s famous Sai Bat almsgiving—a daily tradition unbroken for hundreds of years, but those who go wandering after the ceremony might discover a new tradition a short walk away—the seasonal bamboo bridges across the Nam Khan River. The Nam Khan winds through Luang Prabang before joining the wide Mekong, and during the rainy season residents and visitors use shuttle boats or the Old French Bridge to cross the swollen river. But when the dry season comes along, quicker and more charming options arise—two narrow bamboo bridges. In 2006, a local family erected the twin bridges for the first time and they’ve kept the practice going every November since. Although the bridges are designed primarily for tourist use, the construction is very traditional. Each bridge is made entirely of bamboo and rope (except for the lights), and though they might look (and feel) wobbly, they’re actually quite strong. They rely on bamboo’s natural strength and building techniques employed by Laos for generations. The bridges span the Nam Kahn until rainy season, when they are dismantled until the next year. The larger bridge, set at the picturesque bend of the Nam Khan just as it reaches the Mekong, connects Luang Prabang with two villages noted for their artisans—the weaver’s village of Ban Xieng Lek and the paper-making village of Ban Xiang Khong. The smaller bridge is slightly upstream and connects the old city to the newer side of town, as well as to restaurants and craft shops overlooking the river. This side arguably has the best view; visitors who take the bridge to the Dyen Sabai restaurant at sunset are in for a beautiful view of the fleeting bamboo structure.  The larger bridge can be found at the bottom of the path starting below the Riverpoint Cafe on Khem Khong road. The smaller bridge extends from the old steps leading down from Wat Siphoutthabath on Kingkitsarath Road. Make sure you check with a hotel or tour guide if planning a visit to include the bridges; their presence follows the whims of the river. Note that traversing the bridges is not free. Tickets are sold at small booths on the old town side of each bridge. Passage costs 10,000 Kip (about sixty cents U.S.) for a round trip ticket. It’s a pittance well-spent — the money goes to the families who build and maintain the bridges.",bamboo rivers infrastructure bridges
216,Muang Ngoi Neua,"Muang Ngoy, Laos",A quaint village where bomb casings from the Second Indochina War have been repurposed into mundane objects.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/muang-ngoi-neua,"Sitting on the banks of Ou River, Muang Ngoi Neua is an idyllic village. Only reachable via boat until 2013, this village has witnessed some rapid development due to the influx of tourism, but it has retained its rural quaintness. With the majestic karst limestone mountains as the backdrop, the feel is as rustic and remote as ever. Muang Ngoi Neua has a documented history that goes back to the 15th century, but it was events in the 2oth century that radically changed the lives of its people. During the Second Indochina War (1955-1975), forces of the Pathet Lao (Lao Communist Party) took shelter in the caves near the village. Being sympathetic to the North Vietnamese Communist Regime, Pathet Lao attracted much attention. During this period of time, the United States and U.S.-backed forces dropped over two million tons of cluster bombs over Laos, targeting North Vietnamese forces along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and Lao sympathizers. Cluster bombs were dropped in casings, which would open and scatter bombs over a large area. An estimated 30 percent of these bombs failed to explode on impact. Since the end of the war, more than 20,000 Lao people have been killed or maimed because they accidentally stepped on or hit unexploded ordnance. Alongside the bombs, however, bomb casings also fell on the ground. These casings were made of high-quality, durable metal. In the village of Tha Bak, people made boats out of them. In Muang Ngoi Neua, people repurposed them as flower pots, water troughs, fence poles, and steps, all of which can be seen around the village. Although a bridge connects Muang Ngoi Neua to the main road boats are still running south to Nong Khiaw, and north all the way to Phongsaly.",bombs villages rivers war history military
217,Lao National Museum,"Vientiane, Laos","American bombs, morbid memorabilia, and graphic photographs tell the story of the CIA-led “Secret War” from the Pathet Lao perspective.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lao-national-revolutionary-museum,"Laos is known for its UNESCO-landmarked temples in Luang Prabang and the lush jungles located just across the Mekong from Thailand. Few realize it’s also the most heavily bombed country per capita in the world. Between 1964 and 1973, the United States army dropped 2 million tons of cluster bombs over Laos in a covert attempt by the CIA to wrest power from the Pathet Lao party aligned with the Viet Cong. That’s the equivalent a planeload of bombs dropped every 8 minutes, around the clock for nine years. The Pathet Lao won anyway, and this museum is dedicated to telling the story of that improbable victory. Visitors to the Lao National Museum, housed in the former French governor’s mansion, are quickly hurtled through the early history of Laos via a small exhibit of dinosaur bones and a St. Patrick’s Day green diorama of the Plain of Jars to arrive at the museum’s true focus: the Lao Revolution of the 1970s. You’ll see photos of entire classrooms of children being taught in underground caves to avoid the bombs, though there are photos of broken children and broken buddhas, too. Many Americans are familiar with photos of college students in the 1970s protesting the draft. Here, you’ll see arresting images of Lao holding “U.S., go home” signs and burning effigies of Henry Kissinger; not the type of thing you find in most American history books. Central to the museum’s narrative is the larger-than-life Comrade Kaysone Phomvihane, the revolutionary leader of the Pathet Lao and first prime minister of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. You’ll find “the gun used by Comrade Kaysone Phomvihane to protect himself during the fighting against the U.S. imperialists,” enclosed alongside “the briefcase for comrade Kaysone Phomvihane’s documents during the fighting against U.S. imperialists,” his tea kettle (you get the picture), and even a sort of bicep curl contraption used by the Comrade himself. The permanent exhibit ends with a display of unexploded American bombs and prosthetic limbs used by those unlucky enough to have come across one. About 50 people a year still die from the estimated 18 million bombs still buried beneath the soil. If you look close enough, you can make out the inscription on one of them: “Front toward enemy.” Update March 2019: The museum is no longer open. The nice rustic colonial building is still there and you can take photos outside of the territory. A new museum is under construction.  Note that the museum was formerly called the Lao Revolutionary Museum. Down the road from the museum is the visitor center for COPE, an organization that helps bomb victims with their recovery. It displays prosthetics as well as other artifacts and photographs telling the story of the war.",vietnam war bombs protest weapons lost wonders war history military museums and collections museums

It is estimated that one-third of these did not explode. Nearly 50 years later, people in Laos are still killed or maimed when they encounter unexploded bombs or “ordnance” (UXO). These munitions also keep much of Laos in poverty because clearing land for agriculture or development is hazardous. Children are killed or injured when they mistake UXO for toys. Even the simple act of lighting a fire to cook a meal can set off a weapon buried underneath. The northeastern province of Xieng-Khouang was one of the most heavily bombed areas of Laos, and it is littered with unexploded munitions. Some residents in the village of Ban Napia have turned this problem into a curious and hazardous occupation: They collect UXO, melt it down in a kiln, and fashion it into spoons and other household items using wooden molds. Villagers in Ban Napia, also known as “Spoon Village,” have made the utensils across decades and generations. The work has not been without its hazards, though: People have been killed collecting and processing the UXO. But for many, the reward is worth the risk, as the trade brings much-needed income to the impoverished region.  Most day tours to Xieng-Khouang's Plain of Jars archaeological site include a stop at the Spoon Village.",tools curious kitchenware war fare
