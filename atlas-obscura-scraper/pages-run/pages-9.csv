0,Swayambhunath Monkey Temple,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Sacred Buddhist home of some spiritual monkeys.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/swayambhunath-monkey-temple-in-kathmandu,"This is a workout, wildlife excursion, and spiritual escape all wrapped into one. Be prepared to huff and puff your way up 365 steep steps to meet some furry friends at this Nepali Buddhist site. Located atop a hill west of Kathmandu city, the Swayambhunath complex has been in use since the 5th century and consists of a magnificent domed stupa, as well as a variety of shrines and temples. Each temple is extremely ornate and richly decorated with gold and vibrant prayer flags, though it’s not only the spiritual décor that draws visitors. This sacred pilgrimage site is also home to hundreds of monkeys considered holy to Tibetan Buddhists and Hindus. According to legend, Manjushree, the bodhisattva of wisdom, was in the process of raising the temple hill when the lice in his hair transformed into these monkeys. Swayambhunath means self-arisen and is derived from that legend. The story alone provides enough inspiration for visitors to struggle through the climb to the temple, and the sights at the summit are worth the trek. From the top of the hill, visitors can see a panorama of the Kathmandu valley, along with playful monkeys swinging from trees and prayer flags hanging around the colorful temple. Although the monkeys are somewhat active during the day, the stupa truly becomes a monkey temple at night when hundreds of monkeys frolic in the sacred area and even slide down the banister of the primary structure.  The temple is easily accessible by foot, bike, or taxi from Kathmandu.",monkeys temples sacred spaces animals
1,The Garden of Dreams,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This elegant neoclassical garden is a peaceful oasis in the middle of the Nepalese capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-garden-of-dreams,"The Garden of Dreams (Swapna Bagaicha) was the idyllic vision of Kaiser Sumsher Rana, a field marshal in the Royal Nepalese Army who ordered its creation on the grounds of his palatial home in 1920. Though the garden was severely neglected following his death in 1964, the exquisitely manicured landscapes and the surviving fountains, pergolas, and pavilions have since been restored to their former glory. The four-acre Garden of Dreams in Kathmandu was designed by landscape architect Kishore Narshingh to mimic Edwardian-era English gardens. Most notably, the site was characterized by six pavilions, which symbolized the “six seasons” of Nepal: spring, early summer, the summer monsoon season, early autumn, late autumn, and winter. In its heyday, the garden was considered one of the most remarkable feats of landscape design in the country. Today, visitors will only find three pavilions on just over an acre of land, but the 74,000 square-foot space remains a verdant attraction thanks to a restoration project spearheaded by the Austrian government and Nepal Ministry of Education. Through the garden’s original gates are picturesque fountains and ponds, an amphitheater, isolated gardens of varying sizes, and the Kaiser Café Restaurant & Bar. Meandering pathways are lined with hedges, plants, trees, and flowers from all over the world, complemented by charming stone urns and intricate benches that offer contemplative vistas. While the Garden of Dreams has been transformed into a public space, it remains a tranquil escape in the center of Kathmandu, and a popular hangout for sunbathers, wanderers, residents, and tourists alike.  The Garden of Dreams is open daily from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. It's located in the Kaiser Mahal complex in the busy Thamel neighborhood of Kathmandu. Admission to the garden costs Rs. 400 per person for tourists and Rs. 100 for Nepali residents. Wifi is available throughout the garden for Rs. 50 an hour.",public landscapes gardens parks plants history
2,Boudhanath Stupa,"Kathmandu, Nepal",One of the largest Buddhist stupas in the world keeps an eye out in every direction.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boudhanath-stupa,"For hundreds of years, the Boudhanath Stupa has stood as a beacon of Buddhist belief, towering over the surrounding town as a giant mandala of peace and beauty and also giant eyes. Built some time around the 14th century, the huge meditative monument is said to have been created just after the passing of the Buddha. The huge offering site quickly become an focal point of worship and offering in the area. The structure of the building consists of a giant dome, on the top which sits a Buddhist pyramid tower. All of this sits on top of huge steps shaped like mandalas themselves. Originally the stupa’s spot was on an important trade route which allowed for a steady stream of possible converts. Among the Nepalese in Kathmandu, the stupa is simply referred to as “Chorten Chenpo” which translates to “Great Tower” or just “Great Stupa.” No matter what pilgrims called it, they flocked to the monument in droves. Despite having existed for years, the site did not truly become the center of Tibetan Buddhism until the 1950s as refugees from China immigrated over to Katmandu. Temples and devotional sites began to spring up throughout the surrounding city and further far afield, strengthening the power and importance of the site immeasurably. While it is hard to determine their specific age, the base of the stupa tower is decorated with pairs of eyes on each of the cardinal directions representing the all-knowing nature of the Buddha. However, for those not fully indoctrinated into Buddhist belief, the building (while quite peaceful and beautiful) does seem to be peering down on visitors as they come to make offerings or just to see one of the more spectacular Buddhist sites in the world. The entrance is just basically a gate in a wall.",stupas buddhism architectural oddities architecture
3,Namche Bazaar,"Namche, Nepal",Last stop before the top of the highest peak in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/namche-bazaar-nepal,"Most explorers deciding to tackle the dangers of Mount Everest ready their supplies in the bustling markets of Kathmandu before heading to the brutal ascent to the summit. However, even explorers and adventurers forget to pack things sometimes. In this eventuality, they can stop at the Namche Bazaar, the final major outpost of civilization before the desolate mountain climb begins in earnest. Built along the side of a Nepalese hill, the ramshackle settlement increased in size with the swell in demand for supplies and equipment that came with the deluge of explorers following in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Hillary’s successful Everest ascent. The marketplace village now includes such amenities as internet cafes, a currency exchange, locally-renowned bakeries, and even a small Irish pub. In addition to picking up any supplies, you might need before attempting to climb the world’s highest peak you can also make a stop at Namche’s Museum of Sherpa Culture to learn more about the history of the local people who might keep you alive on your journey. Limited by the geography of the area, Namche Bazaar contains no more than 60-some dwellings amidst the various business endeavors, but the village still manages to hold the distinction of being the wealthiest district in Nepal. If you find yourself making the trek to the top of Everest be sure to stop in the mercantile community and pamper yourself (sort of).",purveyors of curiosities shops
4,The Yeti Scalp of Khumjung,"Khumjung, Nepal",A Himalayan monastery claims to have a piece of a centuries-old abominable snowman.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-yeti-scalp-of-khumjung-khumjung-nepal,"A small village monastery in northeast Nepal claims to have a 300-year-old Yeti scalp, one carried by Sir Edmund Hillary across the globe for inspection by zoologists and other experts. Despite its purported provenance, it did not pass inspection. The half football-shaped scalp sits in a cabinet at the temple, or gomba, of the village called Khumjung, and for a few Nepalese rupees the monks will take out a small, glass-fronted box containing the scruffy-haired dome. But no matter how much the donation, the scalp stays in the padlocked box. The relic is purported by the village to have come from one of the “abominable snowmen” of Himalayan legend and was found by Hillary and journalist Desmond Doig in 1960 when they were on an expedition to look for evidence of the big-footed beast. They found the scalp in the home of old Khumjung woman, who said it was a good-luck charm for the village and was anxious about letting it leave. In order to avoid disaster befalling the village, Hillary agreed to a deal: If he made a donation to the monastery and a local school and took with him a guardian for the scalp from the gomba, they would let it leave and be examined. The scalp turned out to have been fashioned from the hide of an animal, most likely a goat-antelope native to the Himalayas. After its trip and reported debunking, it was returned safely to the monastery; you can read more about that, as well as the duplicate of the scalp at New York’s Explorer’s Club, here, then make up your own mind if they really exist or not. As Khumjo Chumbi, the monk who was charged with watching over the scalp on its round-the-world voyage, told the Guardian newspaper at the time, “We don’t believe in giraffes and lions in Nepal because there aren’t any there. Likewise, you don’t believe in yetis because you have none in your country.” Khumjung is in northeastern Nepal, about 85 miles east of Kathmandu (as the crow flies) and inside Sagarmatha National Park World Heritage Site, an uphill side-trip from the trekking route between Namche and Gorak Shep. When you reach the village, catch your breath and look for the monastery.",yeti exploration temples mountains legends
5,Kathmandu Durbar Square,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This historic square in Nepal is home to temples dating back to the third century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kathmandu-durbar-square,"Kathmandu Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of three squares within Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. Durbar Square (durbar translates to “palace” or “a court held by a prince”) is an important site for Buddhist and Hindu rituals, holy ceremonies, royal events, and kingly coronations. Surrounded by fountains, ancient statues, small ponds, and a series of courtyards such as Mohan Chok and Sundari Chok, Kathmandu Durbar Square is a meditative, religious site for spiritual seekers. Within the inner complex of Durbar Square is the site of the Old Royal Palaces (referred to as the Hanuman Dhoka Palace Complex). The Royal Palaces used to house the kings of the Shah and Malla Dynasty, who ruled over the city until the 19th-century. The palaces have since been turned into museums. The outer complex consists of numerous pagoda-style temples featuring the meticulously carved facades crafted by Newar artists, some of which date back to the 16th-century. Under the direction of the Malla Kings, Durbar Square underwent a series of changes and new architectural additions. King Mahendra Malla (1560–1574) commissioned the construction of the oldest temples in Durbar Square. Built in the Newari architectural style, his contributions included the Jagannath Temple, Kotilingeshwara Mahadev (a stone temple of Lord Shiva), the Mahendreswara Temple, and the magnificent Taleju Temple (the largest and perhaps most important temple of them all). Although these date back to the 16th-century, it’s believed that construction for the square itself and the palaces began as early as the 3rd-century. Later, King Pratap Malla added more additions to the square, including shrines and new temples, and also restored many of the older temples. When he passed away in 1674, new constructions stopped, but picked up again during the Shah Dynasty. One of the most unusual sites built during the Shah Dynasty is the nine-storied structure called the Nautale, commonly referred to as Basantapur Durbar. Located at the east side of the palace, the structure has four roofs and was rumored to be a “pleasure house.” Other popular temples in the square include Mahadev Temple, Shiva Parvati Temple, Maru Ganesh, Bhagwati Temple, Saraswati temple, octagonal Krishna Temple, Jagannath Temple, and the Kal Bhairav (which represents the destructor form of Lord Shiva). Perhaps the most peculiar (and revered) sites at the southern edge of Kathmandu Durbar Square is the three-storied temple called Kumari Bahal. This Newari temple, built by the last Malla king Jayaprakash Malla, houses the Kumari Devi–a young girl chosen through a highly selective process and believed to be the living embodiment of the Hindu mother goddess. The Kumari Devi is paraded around the square in a custom-made gilded chariot during the festival of Indra Jatra and others, and worshipped by the people, who carefully watch her for specific signs that may allude to their fortune and fate. After a devastating earthquake-plagued the area in 2015, many of the ancient temples and historic pagoda-style structures were severely damaged. Kathmandu Durbar Square was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1979, and continues to undergo considerable post-earthquake renovations and reconstruction efforts.

6,Bhaktapur Durbar Square,"Bhaktapur, Nepal",The former stronghold of the Malla Dynasty has remained virtually unchanged since the 17th-century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bhaktapur-durbar-square,"Bhaktapur (also called Bhadgaon or Khwopa) lies in the eastern portion of Kathmandu Valley. At the heart of this ancient city is Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Many of the smaller streets around the city converge onto this square where the royal palace of the Bhaktapur Kingdom was located. The monuments and temples around the site represent the history and traditions of medieval Nepal. Everything around Bhaktapur still looks as it did during its medieval heyday. In fact, Bhaktapur is among the most intact ancient cities in Nepal. It was also given the distinction of being listed as a UNESCO world heritage site.",unesco ancient
7,The Toothache Tree,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Nailing a coin to this holy stump is just another way to ask the gods for relief from dental pain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-toothache-tree-kathmandu-nepal,"The gnarled hunk of wood known as Vaisha Dev, or the Toothache Tree, sits at an unassuming chowk (intersection) just past Thahiti Tole, but visitors could be forgiven for not realizing that it is a tree stump since locals making an offering to the god of sore teeth have covered it in nailed on coins. Said to be a cutting from a legendary tree known as Bangemudha, the chunk of wood that has been put in place smack in the heart of Kathmandu’s dental district, which is home to a concentration of orthodontists’ offices, acts as a sort of wishing well. People with toothaches or other dental ailments visit the site and nail coin to the tree as an offering to Vaishya Dev, the Newar god of the toothache. Supposedly there is a teeny tiny little idol inside of the main hole of the tooth god’s shrine, although the coins nailed on every part of the log obscure any view into the burl. In fact, the log is so covered that none of the actual wood is visible anymore either. The superstitious site is as attractive to worshippers as it is to the dental professionals all around it. As people with tooth problems come to visit the shrine the hope is that they will be lured in by one of the brightly-colored signs advertising the dentists in the area. Orthodontists know an opportunity when they see one (generally in the mouths of candy-crushing twelve-year-olds).",shrines
8,Annapurna,"Khangsar, Nepal","Named after the Goddess of Harvests, Annapurna is the deadliest member of the Eight-thousanders club.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eight-thousander-mountain-annapurna,"There are 14 independent peaks that make up the “Eight-thousanders”, an elite group of mountains that tower more than 8,000 meters (26,247 ft) above sea level, all of which lie in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges in Asia. The most popular of these mountains, Mount Everest, has taken the life of many a brave or foolhardy explorer, but there is another Eight-thousander that makes Everest look like a kiddie ride. Her name is Annapurna. Since the first recorded ill-fated expedition of Albert F. Mummery and J. Norman Collie in 1895, men and women have been compelled to conquer these peaks, and ironically the first successful ascent was located on Annapurna by famed adventurers Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal in 1950. The expedition was successful, but not without a heavy cost – Herzog lost the majority of his fingers and toes to frostbite, and to stave off gangrene had to perform amputations on the mountain, sans anesthetic. No one dared to climb Annapurna again for 20 years. Annapurna is not the tallest mountain – in fact, it’s 10th tallest on the list of the 14. Yet it currently has a fatality-to-summit ratio of 38% which, though recently improved from 40%, is still the highest fatality rate of any of the Eight-thousanders. Why it claims so many lives is uncertain, although the glacial architecture and the illusions it produces have been cited as examples of its treachery. Whatever the reason, this quiet giant with the difficult south slope has called over 200 explorers to her snowy cliffs, and decided to keep over 50 of them as her own.",dead explorers geological oddities natural wonders geology nature
9,Rinchenling Gompa,"Muchu, Nepal",This remote Himalayan temple is in danger of being completely washed away by a melting glacier.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rinchenling-gompa,"Jettisoned straight out of Middle Earth and onto our planet, the Rinchenling Gompa is quite an otherworldly place. Located on the banks of a small tributary of the Limi River, the Halji Gompa is undoubtedly one of the highest temples in the world (approximately 3,600 meters). Adding to the Gompa’s ethereal qualities is its setting: Limi Valley, one of the most remote, and starkly beautiful regions of Himalayan Nepal. The Rinchenling Gompa sits inside Halji Village, one of three small communities within Limi Valley. Access to electricity and warmth are difficult here. Small solar panels, along with a miniature hydro-electric plant provide light only during specified hours of the night. Warmth is provided by burning cow dung in hearths in each of the homes. It’s that remote. Because Limi Valley is right up against the border with Tibet, the Tibetan language is spoken and Tibetan religious customs are practiced in lieu of more Nepali traditions. The Rinchenling Gompa was said to be founded by Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055), an early translator of Buddhist texts into the Tibetan language. Rinchen Zangpo was one of the fathers of the “Second Dissemination” in which Buddhism was reintroduced to Tibet by leading scholars around the beginning of the 11th century. He is said to have established over 108 temples in his lifetime alone. While it is hard to gauge the veracity of these claims, recent C-14 dating of the Vairocana statue inside the temple point to a range in the early 11th century, well within Rinchen Zangpo’s lifetime. In recent years, the Rinchenling Gompa has been threatened by flooding. In 2011, a glacial lake high above Halji Village burst, resulting in a flood that caused significant damage to many structures in Halji Village. Though no one was harmed during the flooding, the risk presented is severe. Without adequate restoration and protection, the Rinchenling Gompa is extremely susceptible to flood damages. A more serious flood could completely wash away over 1,000 years of history. International conservation organizations are starting to take notice, however, so there is some hope that the Gompa will receive the protection it deserves.  Physical fitness and experience traveling in developing countries are critical to accessing Rinchenling Gompa. It is roughly a six day walk from the nearest airstrip in Simikot over highly exposed trails. Accommodations are either the Halji Village guesthouse, or camping facilities.",glaciers temples
10,Taragaon Museum,"Kathmandu, Nepal","This Kathmandu museum, built in an Austrian modernist style, looks like a set from Star Wars.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taragaon-museum,"For many, thinking of Kathmandu conjures images of towering pagoda-style temples and narrow streets choked with exotic, medieval era architecture. But after the city was opened to foreigners in the 1950s, Kathmandu’s landscape began to change. The Taragaon Museum not only chronicles the city’s architectural transformation, but also embodies it. Originally built as a hostel for visiting artists and scientists, the Taragaon grew into a well-known hotel that was later abandoned in the 1990s. The property was rescued by hotelier and philanthropist Arun Saraf, who also owns the adjacent Hyatt hotel, and was revived to honor Kathmandu’s architectural history. The Austrian architect Carl Pruscha, who served as a UN and UNESCO consultant to the Nepalese government, designed the Taragaon in the 1960s based on the artistic vision provided by Angur Baba Joshi. A prominent social activist, Joshi was an Oxford-educated Nepali woman who dreamed of promoting Nepal’s heritage by developing a cultural village. The resulting combination of Pruscha’s European modernism and Nepali traditions spawned a unique structure. Dark red brick dominates the museum’s design as a tribute to the dachi appa brick structures that can be found throughout Kathmandu’s historic districts. The bricks are typically used for the façades of Newari temples and palaces. The barrel-vaulted style rooms, which Pruscha calls “Pati,” were likewise inspired by classic temple architecture. Other elements of the recent restoration are distinctly modern, like the large, circular windows, which are meant as a nod toward the future. Inside, the museum is bedecked with photos, drawings, and sketches of Nepal’s architectural bounty. Two of the oldest items on display are an 1853 etching and an 1863 photograph of Kathmandu. These are complemented by colorful topographic maps and paintings as well as modern sculpture by Nepali artists.  The Taragaon Museum is on the grounds of the Hyatt hotel and is within easy walking distance from Boudha Stupa.  Entry is free.",temples museums architecture
11,Nyatapola Temple,"Bhaktapur, Nepal","Towering at a height of over 30 meters, this turn-of-the-18th-century landmark is the tallest temple in Nepal.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nyatapola-temple,"The imposing Nyatapola Temple stands five tiers tall over Taumadhi Square in the Nepalese city of Bhaktapur, where it was built with time-tested virtuosity at the behest of King Bhupatindra Malla in 1702. While the temple is indeed a splendid relic of treasured Nepalese history, the building’s structure is so solid that it withstood an 8.3 earthquake in 1934, followed by another in 2015, without any significant architectural damage. This exquisite, pagoda-style edifice comprised of wood and brick, and adorned with magnificent carvings was named Nyatapola after the local Newari words for “five-stepped” (nyata) and “roof” (pola). The building maintains associations with the deities Bhairava—a ferocious incarnation of the Lord Shiva—and, principally, Siddhi Lakshmi, the Tantric incarnation of “the invincible” goddess Durga, to whom Nyatapola is dedicated. According to local legend, at a time when Bhairava threatened civilization with annihilation, a desperate king called upon Parvati, the goddess of love, fertility, and beauty. In the form of Siddhi Lakshmi, she thwarted Bhairava with Nyatapola: a far more powerful temple than Bhairava’s neighboring shrine in Taumadhi Square. The original chapel dedicated to Bhairava was a humble construction, added to over time. The temple was destroyed in the earthquake that occurred in 1934 and had to be rebuilt, with a third tier added during reconstruction. Within the sublime Nyatapola Temple is a shrine dedicated to Siddhi Lakshmi, which is purportedly so formidable that it’s been reserved exclusively for temple priests since it was forged. Additional likenesses of Siddhi Lakshmi can be found in details across the temple—above doors and across the roof’s framework. Visitors egress the temple via a brick stairway guarded by five pairs of sculpted deities of ascending power: first, the wrestlers Jayamel and Phattu, believed to have possessed superhuman strength; followed by elephants, lions, then gryphons; and finally, just before the temple doors, the goddesses Baghini—the “Tigress,”—and Singhini—the “Lioness.” Nyatapola was one of several temples built in the states of Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kathmandu during the 18th century. Today, all three former states comprise the Kathmandu Valley, also known as the Valley of the Temples.  The Nyatapola Temple is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, though visitors to the temple during a Nepalese festival or holiday should check beforehand to make sure it's open to the public.",
12,Ranibari Community Forest,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This conservation area filled with colorful birds is the last community forest within the city of Kathmandu.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ranibari-community-forest,"Long-time residents of the Kathmandu Valley often lament the concrete jungle their city has become, but one green hillock in the shadow of the Himalayan foothills has been preserved. Once the site of religious retreats for Nepal’s kings, the Ranibari Community Forest is now an oasis of nature with footpaths that explore 17 acres of densely forested parkland. The forest is most notable for the abundance of birds that make it their home, with more than 67 species regularly spotted here. Visitors can easily spy Alexandrine parakeets fluttering colorfully through the trees, black kites arguing with crows, or scarlet minivets frolicking in the canopy. And the extravagantly tailed red-billed blue magpies are one of the highlights of any birding trip to the forest. Fittingly, Bird Conservation Nepal has developed the forest as a bird and biodiversity conservation learning center. Two main trails encircle the forest, one at the base which staves off the ever encroaching city development, and one that circles the top of the hill allowing views of the city and Himalayas beyond. Also at the top of the hill is a small Ranidevi temple with murti dedicated to Shiva, Krishna, and Ganesh. Otherwise, the forest is the domain of native flora and fauna. Nepal launched the community forest program in 1973 and currently there are nearly 20,000 forests across the country. The Kathmandu Valley region has 144 community forests, but Ranibari is the only one within the boundary of the Ring Road that encircles the cities of Kathmandu and Patan. Anyone looking for a respite from the functional anarchy of Kathmandu’s crowded city center will undoubtedly find nirvana tucked in the Ranibari forest.  The forest is free to enter before 9:30 a.m., but costs the princely sum of 10 rupees thereafter.",urban parks forests parks ecosystems animals
13,Lukla Airport,"Chaurikharka, Nepal",Jumping-off point for a climb up Mt. Everest is the most dangerous airport in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lukla-airport,"The little town of Lukla is the starting point of almost all trekking journeys in the Khumbu region. Situated at an altitude of 2,860 meters, Lukla is the first site that trekkers get introduced to when visiting Khumbu. It is a collection of small houses and hotels that are scattered within proximity to the region’s only airport- the Tenzing Hillary Airport. Because of its prominence, Lukla has transformed from a small farming community to a commercial hub of the region that is on par with Namche Bazaar. Due to trekkers staying overnight at Lukla during Everest Treks, the town has seen a rise in the number of luxury guesthouses and hotels in recent years. From Kathmandu, it takes about 40 minutes to reach Lukla via plane. Also famously known as the Lukla Airport, the Tenzing Hillary Airport is a small airport that is often referred to as one of the most dangerous airports in the world. The airport is among the most famous transport connection between the rest of Nepal and the Everest Mountains, with other ways of reaching Khumbu are long days of trekking. Daily flights occur to/from the airport during daylight hours and in good weather conditions. In contrast to Kathmandu’s steady sun-shining, Lukla often experiences rainfall, sometimes simultaneously with the lack of rain in other parts of the country. Lukla’s topographical position in the mountain gives way to high winds, dense cloud cover, and changing visibility. This, as a result, often leads to flight delays or the airport being closed. The Lukla Airport was built in 1964. The construction was done under the supervision of Sir Edmund Hillary, and until recently in 2001, the airport runway wasn’t even properly paved. It was renamed in 2008 in honor of Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, the first people to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. The runway is 527 meters long and 30 meters wide and the airport is used mostly for passenger flights and the transport of goods and cargo to Lukla and other villages in the north of the region, as there is no road access. The airplanes landing or taking off from the Lukla Airport must use a single runway. High terrain blocks the already low prospect of go-around on short final airplane approaches, and the runway ends in a steeply angled drop into the valley below. As such, landing and taking off from Lukla is difficult. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has, as a result, set high standards for which only experienced pilots who have completed at least 100 short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) missions are allowed to land at the airport. The pilots must also have over one year of STOL experience in Nepal and must have completed ten missions into Lukla with a certified instructor pilot. However, despite the difficulties, Lukla has one of the busiest domestic airports in Nepal. Accidents happen rarely, and the airport is considered one of the most beautiful airports in the world. It is surrounded by the mighty Himalayas and the towering emerald hills that shadow over the village. There is no use of air navigation or radar systems. Instead, for landing and take-offs, radio communication is used. The paved road is small and is only suitable for helicopters and small aircraft with fixed wings and short takeoffs.Landing at the Tenzing Hillary Airport begins from north to south, and takeoff is from south to north of the runway. Furthermore, the runway is secured by the Nepal Army and has a wired fence around it. Despite notoriously having the reputation as the most dangerous airport in the world, the Lukla Airport carried out about 20 or 30 aircraft landings every day during the peak seasons. Almost more than half the trekkers who visit Nepal annually tend to fly into Lukla. While the airport at Lukla is comparatively more dangerous statistically than a typical commercial airport, it is still pretty safe. The aviation officials of Nepal and local airlines are very strict on the acceptable flight conditions and regulations for aircraft making the journey to Lukla.  There are options available for trekking to Everest without flying. The alternate options include trekking to Lukla either from Jiri, Salleri or Kharihola. However, trekking to Lukla instead of flying takes about 3 to 8 days. Due to Lukla’s position and elevation, weather conditions and visibility are constantly dynamic and can change rapidly. Thus, flight schedules to Lukla can be difficult and are hard to predict. The airlines do not take chances with weather conditions and will return a flight to Kathmandu from anywhere along its journey rather than risk an unsafe landing if the weather conditions change since takeoff. As such, flight delays are very common. They can happen at any time of year but are especially likely to occur during the monsoon season (late May to early September). If your flight is delayed, then you will have to reschedule the next possible flight. Travel agencies take care of rescheduling for you if you are hiring them for treks. As conditions at Lukla can change so rapidly, rescheduling may be very soon after your scheduled departure, or it may take as much as a few days later- it is very difficult to predict. This, of course, can be pretty frustrating, but it is simply a part of the journey to the Everest region. It is strongly recommended to add at least a day or two to the end of the trip for flexibility in case of any delays. Extra days should always be scheduled at the end of the trip as this provides flexibility with the trekking itinerary in case of any weather delays.  You can get a cab in Kathmandu to get to the Tribhuvan International Airport. The cab fare can cost about NPR 1000. It is recommended to get to the airport at least one hour before your flight time.",architectural oddities architecture

Carved out of the side of the Himalayan foothills, the park can be reached by climbing a series of steep steps, but the vista is well worth the effort. Buddha looks over a valley with Kathmandu on one side, and the dazzling curvilinear striations of extensive terrace farms on the other. Behind the park, at the top of the hill, and above the clouds, the Himalayas are on full display. The golden statue positioned on the central plinth is a depiction of the “Earth Touching Buddha,” also known as the Buddha exhibiting the “Bhumisparsha Mudra.” In this pose, Buddha’s right-hand reaches toward the ground, and his middle finger touches the ground symbolizing the moment of his enlightenment. According to the backstory, while Buddha was meditating under a Bodhi tree, he was harangued by the demon Mara. Buddha called to the earth goddess to witness his enlightenment. The goddess responded by sending a flood to wash away Mara and allow Buddha to complete his spiritual journey. The earthly landscape surrounding Buddha is covered in picturesque terraced farms. In a country where crop yields are low and food insecurity is high, more than 13 million Nepalese depend on sustainable terrace farming. When viewed from a distance, the beauty and romance of the farms hide the incredibly hard work it takes to create and maintain the fields—work that is done entirely by hand and mostly by women. The nearby town of Nagarkot provides luxury hotel accommodations, as well as views of six of the world’s 14 highest mountain peaks. A special viewing platform was constructed specifically to watch the sunrise over Everest. Here, meditating visitors can replicate Buddha’s earth goddess invocation and absorb the unrivaled views.  The park is free to visit and is open 24 hours. If visitors are so inclined, they may plant a tree in the park in honor of a special occasion or in memory of a loved one. The cost is modest, $3-$4, and the park will nurture it to maturity.",buddha buddhism parks history & culture
16,Tiger Tops,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Host to the World Elephant Polo Championships since 1982.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tiger-tops,"These four-ton athletes are highly trained, well-kept polo machines. No more than two games are played per day, and no player is allowed to play those two games in a row. Games end at noon, and snacks and beverages are served at half-time—fresh cut grass and about 22 gallons of water. Daily baths in the river keep the competitors refreshed and clean. Since 1982, Tiger Tops has been hosting the World Elephant Polo Championships in Nepal, as well as serving as headquarters for the exotic variation on the popular sport. Fairly self-explanatory, the game consists of the basic polo guidelines with a few necessary changes to accommodate the size of the player’s mounts—a six-to-10-foot cane with a standard mallet head on the end, a pitch shortened to 3/4 the length to make up for the elephant’s lack of speed, and each elephant carries two riders who must rely on a mahout to do the steering as they shout out directions. Along with the altered guidelines come elephant-specific rules that must be put into play. An elephant who lies down in front of the goal mouth will receive a foul, and if they use their trunk to pick up the ball, that not only constitutes a foul, but earns their opponent a free hit. Rice balls enhanced with molasses and rock salt act as treats at the end of each match while riders are rewarded with a beer, and all games end by noon to avoid the afternoon heat. While there’s debate on whether these amazing animals should be used for sport at all, the World Elephant Polo Association (WEPA) keeps strict guidelines regarding the safety and well being of the elephants. PETA has targeted the sport, costing the organizations sponsorship withdrawals and the occasional match cancellation, and safety was put into question when two players were injured and the minibus of one of the visiting teams was destroyed when an elephant went on a rampage in 2007. Despite the controversy and criticism, Tiger Tops and WEPA maintain that their animals are happy, healthy, and enjoy the opportunity for social interaction and the break from their normal routine of giving safari rides to tourists. The tournament takes place every December on the edge of Chitwan National Park, and include 16 domesticated Asian elephants, half of them belonging to Tiger Tops and the others brought in by Nepal National Parks. The elephants are accompanied by their mahouts, who usually have been partnered with the animals for several years. Update as of December 2017: Tiger Tops no longer host elephant polo, although other events exist involving the elephants.",fauna sports animals
17,Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve,"Bairawa, Nepal",Nepal’s last remaining population of wild water buffalo and many other rare species call this reserve home.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koshi-tappu-wildlife-reserve,"In Nepal’s southeastern region of Terai, the Sapta Koshi River, a tributary of the Ganges, is the lifeblood of a 43,000-acre wildlife reserve. Known today for hosting nearly 500 bird species, the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve was originally established to protect the last remaining population of Asian wild buffalos in Nepal. The Asian buffalo has been endangered for decades and current worldwide numbers stand around 4,000. When the reserve was established in 1976, Nepal had a total population of 63. Today, some 500 buffalo can be found in Koshi Tappu. In addition to the buffalos, Koshi Tappu is known for the successful management of wetlands that support other threatened species. The Ganges river dolphin numbers, for example, have started to increase in the region especially in the Koshi River. Interestingly, India conferred “non-human person” status on the species in 2013 to further protect them. Another endangered species, the Gharial crocodile, was declared extinct in the Koshi River in 1970, but as of 2019, they have been sighted once again in the reserve. Cooperation between Nepal and India, as well as a partnership with the Frankfurt Zoo, has brought the crocodile back from the brink. In 2006, only 250 Gharial crocodiles were thought to exist in the wild, but the new sightings in Koshi Tappu indicate a recovery. Notably, the reserve was declared a Ramsar site in 1987, and in 1998, the reserve began aggressively addressing problems of poaching and encroachment by domestic animals. Unfortunately, surveys have indicated that a lack of support for conservation efforts continues to hinder progress. Researchers however have identified areas of development for nature and culture-based recreational tourism that may provide solutions to increasing conservation efforts.  The Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve can be easily reached from Biratnagar, Nepal.  Generally, the best time to visit is October through March. The Koshi Tappu Wildlife Camp offers guided tours including rafting and jeep safaris through Explore Nepal, Ltd.",nature preserves wildlife nature animals
18,Annapurna Natural History Museum Butterfly Collection,"Pokhara, Nepal",Feast your eyes upon hundreds of Nepal's native butterflies and moths.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/annapurna-natural-history-museum-butterfly-collection,"Pokhara has its fair share of museums, but the Annapurna Butterfly Museum truly makes the heart flutter. The butterfly museum is tucked away on the second floor of a building in the Prithivi Narayan University campus, which also has a small natural history and environmental museum (and possibly the world’s worst taxidermy leopard). The museum displays nearly all of Nepal’s 660 native species of butterfly and moth. Wonderful handmade dioramas display the medley of moths and butterflies. The dioramas and the meticulous index show the regions of Nepal in which the winged critters were found. Other butterflies are preserved under glass in wooden drawers and are grouped by related species. Exploring the drawers is a fun box-of-chocolates way to become acquainted with the stunning variety of native moths and butterflies of this diverse and unique biosphere, especially before taking off on a trek to visit their living relatives. A highlight of the collection is Attacus atlas, the largest moth in the world by wingspan. But if you don’t see the massive moth, admiring the many mountain and tropical butterflies displayed in this curated, meticulously organized collection is still a treat.  The museum is located about 4.5 miles (seven kilometers) from the main tourist district of Lakeside. Entry is donation based, and generally open during normal business hours, which can be somewhat unpredictable in Nepal. It's accessible via bike, bus, or taxi and is walkable from the Seti River Gorge if you visit there as well.",butterflies insects museums and collections museums
19,The Pashupatinath Temple,"Kathmandu, Nepal","The oldest Hindu temple complex in Nepal serves as the seat of Nepal’s national deity, Lord Pashupatinath.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pashupatinath-temple,"The Pashupatinath temple complex is part of UNESCO’s World Heritage Site. The temple’s age is not exactly certain, but legend indicates its existence to date back to 400 BC. The complex includes 518 temples, buildings, and structures. The main temple is designed as a pagoda structure, located within the fortified courtyard, and guarded by Nepalese military force and semi-military Nepali police. Features of the main pagoda include carved wooden rafters, cubic sculptures, with two-level roofs covered with copper and gold sheets. Four main doors to the pagoda are covered with silver sheets, while the pinnacle is gold. The temple has two interior rooms where the Pashupatinath (AKA Shiva) idol is placed. Near the temple’s western door stands a bronze statue of Nandi bull, the sacred vehicle or vahana of Shiva. Temples in the complex are designed in Vaishnav (Vishnu) and Shaiva (Shiva) tradition. The main idol is a stone deity with four faces representing Shiva’s various aspects, Sadyojata (or Barun), Vamadeva (or Ardhanareshwara), Tatpurusha, Aghora & Ishana (imaginative). Facing the four directions as well as zenith, they represent the five primary elements (earth, water, air, light, and ether). Unlike other Shiva lingams in India and Nepal, this Pashupati Shiva idol is always in its golden cover except during prayer. Pouring milk and water from the Ganges river (ganga jal) which are standard acts of Hindu ritualistic worship is possible only during the abhisheka prayer times and conducted only by the main priests. The Pashupatinath idol can be touched only by the main Bhatt priests while the Bhandari priests assist the Bhatt priests during daily pooja worship rituals.  The April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the Pashupatinath temple complex, where some of the outer buildings were severely damaged. Only practicing Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains of Indian origin are allowed into the inner temple courtyard. Hindus of western descent and non-Hindus are given restricted entry to the temple courtyard. Take a taxi from Kathmandu city center to Pashupatinath, which will cost around $15. Guides cost about $10 while a non-Hindu can enter the temple for a $10 entrance fee. The inner temple courtyard is open from 4 AM to 7 PM, while the inner temple is open from 5 AM to 12 noon for morning worship and viewing and then 5 PM to 7 PM for the evening prayer and viewing.",
20,International Mountain Museum,"Pokhara, Nepal",A museum with a window view of the Himalayas and an on-site climbing wall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/international-mountain-museum,"From a presentation of the world’s highest peaks to an exhibition of Everest’s climbers’ gear, this modern museum offers everything you need to know about mountains and the history of mountaineering. Opened in 2004, the museum has a focus on Nepali mountains and the Himalayas, with a wing dedicated to Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, who first summited Everest in 1953. There is also an exhibition about the legend of the Yeti, beliefs and facts about the abominable snowman—which they recognize is probably a Tibetan brown bear. On a clear day, visitors will have a wonderful view on the Annapurna mountain range in the northwest, quite appropriate for the theme of the museum. Outside, there is a “living museum” dedicated to the diverse tribes and indigenous people of Nepal, their cultures and their homes. Nepal is an extremely diverse nation, with as many as 125 different castes and ethnic groups. Clothes and crafts from many of these different groups are on display at the museum. The museum also has its own mountain to climb, a 31-foot (9.44-meter) replica of Mt. Manaslu, the eighth highest peak in the World, also located in Nepal.  The museum is open  daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Entrance fees are 100 rupees for Nepali citizens and 500 rupees for foreigners (check website for other ticketing discounts).

21,Amideva Buddha Park,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This religious site features Nepal’s largest statue of Buddha.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amideva-buddha-park,"A short distance from the more famous Swayambunath Temple is the quieter, but no less impressive Amideva Buddha Park, built in 2003 and featuring a gigantic triumvirate. But those who take the time to wander around the park will find many more curious marvels. Measuring 67 feet tall, the central statue that dominates the landscape is of Shakyamuni Buddha, the historical Buddha who began life as Siddhartha Gautama. This portrayal is the Amitābha (or Amideva) form of the Buddha, who is associated with longevity. He holds a giant bowl in his hands, which contains the nectar of immortality. To the left of Shakyamuni Buddha is the 64-foot-tall Chenrezig (also known as Avalokitesvara), the “one who looks with unwavering eye.” He is the most compassionate of all Bodhisattvas, and those who utter the mantra “Om Mani Padme Hum” invoke his assistance. He is depicted with many arms which he uses to reach out to help the multitudes in need. The Dalai Lama is considered an incarnation of Chenrezig. To the right of Shakyamuni Buddha, also at 64 feet tall, is Guru Rinpoche (aka Guru Padmasambhava), “The Precious Master.” Incarnated as a fully enlightened being, Guru Rinpoche is a keeper of primordial wisdom and revealed to the world the complete Vajrayana (tantric) teachings. The statues are encircled by prayer wheels. Walking behind them reveals a great many additional treasures including an ornate stupa, a chörten containing an enormous prayer wheel, intricate artwork around the base of the statues, and the occasional rooster. Of particular interest are the sculptural recreations of sacred mountains including Kailashnath, the mountain where Shiva is said to reside. To one side of Kailashnath is a large golden shiva lingam, which may or may not be considered a phallic symbol, depending on the information source. Despite its size and religious significance, this park gets far fewer visitors than other sites around Kathmandu. A stop here can provide both a respite from the chaos of the city and a chance to take a quiet step toward enlightenment.  Although local opportunists may attempt to extract a fee from visitors, the park is free to enter.",buddha religious parks buddhism statues
22,Changu Narayan,"Changunarayan, Nepal","Dating back to the fourth century, it's the oldest Hindu temple still in use in the Kathmandu Valley.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/changu-narayan,"Changu Narayan is a two-story pagoda-style temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu and surrounded by ancient carvings and statues. Having survived destruction in 1702 and 2015, it is said to be the oldest Hindu temple still in use in the Kathmandu Valley today. The entire Kathmandu Valley is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, encompassing seven groups of monuments and buildings. These include the Durbar Squares of Hanuman Dhoka (Kathmandu), Patan and Bhaktapur; the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath; and the Hindu temples of Pashupati and Changu Narayan. Dating back to the fourth century, Changu Narayan is widely considered to be the oldest Hindu temple in Bhaktapur, and one of the oldest in Nepal. Built on top of a high hill about seven miles directly east of Kathmandu, the temple is dedicated to Vishnu, although shrines to Lord Shiva, Ashta Matrika, Chhinnamasta, Kileshwor, and Krishna are also found within the wider temple complex. The main temple is decorated with some of the finest carvings in the Kathmandu Valley, and the collection of statues surrounding the temple is the best you’ll see outside the National Museum of Nepal. The diagonal beams that support the temple’s two pagoda roofs are decorated with intricate carvings of the 10 incarnations of Vishnu and various multi-armed Tantric goddesses. The temple’s four entrances, meanwhile, are guarded by stone lions, griffins, elephants, and sarabhas (part-lion, part-bird creatures from Hindu mythology). But the gems of the collection are the statues and carvings dotted around the courtyard, the oldest dating back to the Licchavi era (400 to 750). Facing the west door of the temple is a statue of Garuda, the legendary bird that served as Vishnu’s mount, which dates back to the fifth century. And near this statue is the oldest stone inscription in the Kathmandu Valley, a message etched in 464 that tells the tale of how a king convinced his mother not to die by suicide after her husband’s death. Other statues show Vishnu in his various incarnations, or avatars. Vishnu appears as Narsingha, the man-lion, ripping a man apart with his fingers. He also appears as Vikrantha, the six-armed dwarf who transformed into a giant. And in the northwest corner of the complex is an image of Vishnu riding his faithful mount Garuda. The temple complex and its numerous statues have survived a number of threats over the centuries. The most serious was a fire that swept through the compound in 1702, destroying many works. The temple was rebuilt in the following years. More recently, the Gorkha Earthquake of April 2015 damaged 753 temples, shrines, and monasteries across Nepal, including 241 in Kathmandu. Changu Narayan suffered heavy damage but restoration projects began almost immediately. It was reopened the same year, and the Department of Archeology announced that the restoration project had been completed in November 2017. Visitor numbers declined following the earthquake, and have yet to return to pre-quake levels.  Changu Narayan is located about seven miles east of Kathmandu. From Kathmandu you can take the bus to Bhaktapur, then take another bus to the temple. There's also a museum located on the way up to the temple. Inside the temple complex you are free to explore most of the grounds, but only priests can enter the main temple. The entrance fee for foreign nationals is 300 Nepalese rupees ($2.60 US).",hinduism unesco temples ancient religion sacred spaces statues
23,Apollo Lunar Sample Displays,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Visitors to the National Museum of Nepal can moon over a set of well-traveled flags.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/apollo-lunar-sample-displays,"When the astronauts of Apollo 11 went to the moon, they brought along flags from each of the 50 states and all U.S. territories, as well as from 135 countries to hand out as goodwill souvenirs upon their return, along with small samples from the moon’s surface. In 1972, the crew of Apollo 17 did the same. Today, Nepal is one of 29 countries to still have both. You can find them at the National Museum of Nepal, tucked in a small corner next to a rhinoceros skull. The display from Apollo 11 includes four grains of moon dust in acrylic casing, while the one from Apollo 17 has a small moon rock. These celestial accessories were created by NASA at the request of U.S. President Richard Nixon and were intended to promote world peace. Over the years, many of these lunar display samples have gone missing or turned up on the black market, some selling for millions of dollars. It is estimated that of the 270 flag keepsakes, the whereabouts of 180 are unknown. As a result, a cottage industry to find these missing rocks was spawned, led by Joseph Gutheinz who became known as “The Moon Rock Hunter” for Operation Lunar Eclipse, a sting operation to stop the sale of bogus moon rocks. These relics of the U.S. space program are far from the only things worth visiting at the National Museum of Nepal. Exhibitions are housed in three sizable buildings: one dedicated to the art of Nepal, another a gallery devoted to Buddhism, and the third (where the flags are displayed), that focuses on natural and cultural history. The art gallery features works in stone, metal, wood, and on canvas, tracing nearly 2,000 years of art and history in the Kathmandu Valley and beyond. (Pride of place goes to a 2nd century stone sculpture of King Jayavarma which has one of the earliest inscriptions in Nepal.) The Buddhist gallery is expertly curated to teach visitors of all ages about the religion while surrounded by the enchanting trappings of monasteries. And the natural history building is replete with bones, taxidermy, and dioramas that will fascinate and perplex.  Despite its name, the National Museum is not usually listed as a main attraction in Kathmandu. It is off the beaten path away from more famous sights, but it is easy to find on Museum Marg, about a 20 minute walk west of Durbar Square.",flags astronauts moon space space exploration museums
24,Raithaane,"Lalitpur, Nepal",This restaurant preserves and serves lesser-known and regional Nepali food.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/raithaane,"Nepali cuisine is often depicted or known for—especially abroad—only a few dishes, such as momos, dumplings, and dal bhat, a staple meal of lentil soup, rice, pickles, mixed vegetables, and occasionally meat. But Raithaane has neither momos nor dal bhat, nor does it serve much resembling the food found in restaurants around Kathmandu. The diverse menu includes pork-rich dishes from Eastern Nepali communities, stews from northern Sherpas, black lentil patties from the west, and battered deep-fried vegetables from the south. Opened in late 2018, Raithaane highlights these dishes to preserve the country’s gastronomical heritage and to educate Nepalis on their country’s complicated and varied gastronomical traditions. With a population of 28 million and 125 distinct ethnic groups, it’s no small endeavor. Started by three food-obsessives, two Nepali and one French, they mix of ingredients to give customers a taste of Nepali food they might have never encountered. To serve these dishes, some of which rely on traditional grains and produce that are disappearing in favor of foreign imports, the Raithaane team works with local farmers and the agricultural system. Their goal is to highlight and help create demand for soon-to-be-lost Nepali ingredients that sustained the country for centuries. That said, the chefs are not slaves to tradition, mixing cheese from yak milk into Nepali buckwheat gallettes, and the restaurant’s sweets—especially a pie made of juju dhau, or strained buffalo yoghurt—have inspired a small cult following.  Peel your eyes when looking for Raithaane. The restaurant is not visible from the unnamed lane on which it sits, tucked in the southwestern corner of a small courtyard. There is a small blackboard on the street, however. Also be aware that Raithaane follows a highly seasonal menu, so may not have every dish on its menu at all times. Hours have also varied due to the pandemic, though there are now take-out and delivery options, so be sure to check the restaurant's Facebook page for updates.",restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars food
25,Nyālon (Fish Stone),"Kathmandu, Nepal",This small shrine dedicated to a fish is believed to hold the secrets to this historic market's founding.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nyalon-fish-stone,"Walking from Thamel, the main tourist district of Kathmandu, to historic Durbar Square, one will pass through the bustling market of Asan Tole. Amid the crowds and teeming stalls are several temples and shrines including a tikka-ed stone fish coyly hiding in plain sight. The fish is easily overlooked since the adjacent Ganesh and Annapurna temples garner more attention. However, according to at least one legend, the Asan bazaar owes its name to a fish that fell at the location of the shrine. The origin of the name Asan is shrouded in mystery, but some believe it derives from the Newari word ansaa meaning “just there” or “nearby.” As the story goes, a fish once fell from the sky during a heavy rainstorm. As the tale of the fish spread, visitors to Kathmandu would ask, “where did it fall?” and locals would reply “ansaa,” pointing to the spot where the shrine now stands. Today, Asan is a primary market for locals and stands at the nexus of six streets that were an important meeting place along an ancient trade route between India and Tibet. Everything from spices and dried fish, to plastic toys and hardware, can be found in the bazaar. Those selling grains or rice are required to offer a portion of their goods to the temple dedicated to Annapurna Ajima, the goddess of abundance and the patron deity of the neighborhood. The symbol of the fish is one of the more important avatars of the god Vishnu, who once transformed into Matsya (the fish) to save humanity from the great flood. The fish is also one of the Ashtamangala (the Eight Auspicious Signs) found in Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. It’s the focus of numerous religious parables.  The shrine is found in the Asan Tole market.",markets fish legends history & culture
26,Budhanilkantha,"Budhanilkantha, Nepal",This representation of Lord Vishnu is the largest stone sculpture in Nepal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/budhanilkantha,"Nestled in the Himalayan foothills well north of Kathmandu’s city center is a wholly remarkable Hindu temple. The site pays homage to Vishnu (Narayan) whose likeness floats on the sea of bliss reclining upon the multi-headed snake Shesh. It’s believed the 16-foot (5-meter) long sculpture made from a single block of basalt, was created during the 6th-century CE by Vishnugupta, an early king of the Kathmandu Valley. Dedication to the worship of Vishnu at this temple varied over the centuries and was rediscovered periodically by devotees. Today, it’s an important religious center for thousands of pilgrims who visit every year during Haribondhini Ekadashi. This sacred event is held during the 11th day of the Hindu month of Kartik (October – November). The event marks the end of the four-month period of Chaturmas, during which Vishnu is believed to sleep. As a member of the Hindu triad along with Shiva and Brahma, Vishnu represents goodness and preservation. Some Hindus believe that Buddha was an incarnation of Vishnu, and some Buddhists venerate Vishnu as a protector of Buddhism. Regardless of the connection, the name Budhanilkantha has nothing to do with Buddha. Perhaps more confusingly, Vishnu has over a thousand different names, but Budhanilakantha is not one of them. Sanskrit for “Old Blue Throat,” Budhanilakantha is actually one of the names for Lord Shiva. The origin of the name lies in legends that discuss the struggles between gods and demons that accidentally released a poison from the ocean of existence, requiring intercession by Shiva. To save the world, Shiva drank the poison and then quenched his burning throat with the waters of Lake Gosainkund. The poison left a blue bruise on his throat, hence the name Budhanilkantha. The water surrounding the recumbent Vishnu at the temple is believed to be from Lake Gosainkund, and the faithful believe that a mirror image of Shiva lies on the underside of the sculpture. Despite the complexity of Vaishnavism nomenclature, the temple itself is a visual delight, frequently adorned with colorful flowers and tika powder. It’s also surrounded by classic Nepali and Newari architecture in a paradigmatic Himalayan neighborhood.",temples legends religion sacred spaces history & culture
27,Shiva Statue,"Shankharapur, Nepal","The spot where Parvati convinced Shiva to marry her, has become a pilgrimage site for married and unmarried women.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shiva-statue,"Not far from the headwaters of the Manohara River, Shiva sits overlooking a sacred spot marked by the Swasthani Mandir. It was here that Parvati fasted and endured extraordinary hardships in an effort to charm a grieving Shiva to become her husband. As the story goes, Shiva was in mourning after the death of his first wife, Sati. While he was secluded the demon Tarakasura, who could only be killed by a son of Shiva, ran amok. The other gods implored Shiva to leave his retreat, marry Parvati (an incarnation of Sati), and produce a son that could stop the rampaging Tarakasura. Shiva eventually relented, but tested Parvati’s devotion through multiple trials performed along the banks of the Manohara River. Revealing herself to be steadfastly faithful, Shiva married Parvati and their son, Kartikeya, vanquished the demon. The rituals performed by Parvati are associated with Swasthani, the goddess of good fortune, and the nearby temple is named in her honor. Every year between the full moons of January and February, thousands of women gather at the temple to recite the “Swasthani Barta Katha,” a cycle of 31 stories originally narrated by Lord Kumar, a son of Shiva and Parvati. For a full month, married women fast and pray for the well-being of their husbands, while single women emulate Parvati in hopes of gaining a spouse. The festival concludes when the women offer (among other items) 108 holy threads, 108 sel­rotis (ring-shaped sweet rice bread), and 108 fruits to Swasthani. Women without husbands or sons give a portion of the offerings to the river. The number 108 symbolizes Shiva’s 108 attendants. So while the goddess is worshipped for her power, it’s in the context of Shiva’s patriarchy. As a result, the stories of the Swasthani Barta Katha are interpreted differently by different generations. But at this sacred site, tradition endures under the watchful gaze of Lord Shiva.",pilgrimages rituals religion sacred spaces history & culture

Nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty (151 feet), Shiva is comprised of copper, zinc, concrete, and steel. It’s also the second tallest Hindu deity in the world. Accompanied by his telltale trident representing Shiva’s three functions as creator, preserver, and destroyer, as well as a damaru (drum), which he uses in his dance, Shiva is also garlanded by the serpent Vasuki, who represents power and fearlessness. Next to Shiva is Nandi, the bull that represents one of Shiva’s alter egos Pashupati, or “Lord of Cattle.” Surrounding the statue in the temple complex are 12 Shiva lingams, which may or may not be symbolic phalluses depending on the source, but represent Shiva’s role as a creator and god of fertility. The name Kailashnath means “Master of Mount Kailash,” while Mahadev means “great god.” Mount Kailash, Shiva’s traditional home, is a 21,800-foot tall mountain in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China near the northwest corner of Nepal. It sits near the headwaters of the Indus, Brahmaputra, and Karnali rivers. To help visitors and votaries reach Shiva’s mount, a new 738-foot pedestrian suspension bridge was recently constructed over the busy Araniko Highway. The views of the Himalayas and Kathmandu Valley from the bridge are alone worth the hike up to the statue.  Kailashnath Mahadev can be viewed 24 hours a day, but access to the grounds is limited to 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The statue is also part of a large resort run by the Hilltake company.",design religion sacred spaces statues history & culture
29,Bardia National Park,Nepal,This park is the prime habitat for Nepal’s Bengal tigers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bardia-national-park,"A little more than 60 Royal Bengal tigers roam Bardia National Park, around one-fourth the total tiger population in Nepal. Together with the adjacent Banke National Park, Bardia forms part of the 860 square mile Tiger Conservation Unit, where visitors have a sporting chance of seeing the usually elusive great cats in the wild. Because it’s more remote than the better known Chitwan National Park, few people visit the less developed Bardia, allowing flora and fauna to flourish. Tigers and one-horned rhinos are especially abundant here, but more than 50 other mammals call Bardia home. These include the Gangetic river dolphin, swamp deer, and wild elephants. Additionally, the park is a birder’s paradise with more than 400 species having been recorded within the park. Mugger crocodiles, and their pointy-nosed cousins the gharial, also lurk in the Babai River where their critically endangered population is starting to recover. The park began as a royal hunting ground and was later transformed into a larger reserve. It was named a national park in 1988. To create the reserve, over 1,500 households were moved to establish the nearly 250,000-acre park, but despite this, the region is culturally rich. In particular, the indigenous Dangaura Tharu people occupy the surrounding area around Nepal’s Terai region. With such a vibrant natural setting, it’s no surprise that the Tharu are animists whose generations of isolation led to a culture and language distinct from other prominent Nepali groups. The increase in both the tiger and human populations over the past few decades has unfortunately resulted in increased violent interactions near Bardia. In 2020, two Tharu men who ventured from their nearby farms into the dense jungle were killed by a tiger. The Indian side of the border has also experienced tiger attacks near the neighboring Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary. To keep things in perspective, the total tiger population is approximately 3,500 with around 250 in Nepal and 3,250 in India.

30,Aircrafts Museum,"Dhangadhi, Nepal",Nepal's first aviation museum found a logical home in the most unexpected place.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aircrafts-museum,"Commercial pilot and former member of the Nepalese Army, Bed Upreti, created Nepal’s Aircrafts Museum to bring tourism and awareness to Nepal’s remote far west region, and within its first years of operation, the destination has succeeded in making a mark on all who have made a pilgrimage to the area to visit the charming temple to aviation. Housed inside the fuselage of a 100-seater aircraft from defunct Cosmic Air, visitors approach the museum’s entrance and are greeted by a sign bearing instructions to take off one’s shoes. Upon doing so, the door to the aircraft opens and a man dressed in a flight attendant’s uniform offers a greeting to all. The tour begins winding its way through the interior of the aircraft. During a stop in the plane’s cockpit, guides impart the more technical aspects of how one actually goes about navigating and flying aircraft. Throughout the tour, a profusion of over 200 models of commercial and fighter jets line the plane’s walls, all of which were built by local children. These miniature contributions to the museum exist as part of Bed Upreti’s community outreach initiative intended to bolster the youth’s interest in aviation, all of which is, in turn, fueled by the enthusiasm of the new visitors to the region thanks to the Aircrafts Museum itself.  Pay close attention to the blue and white signs along the main road, as it is easy to get lost along the way.",aviation aircraft airplanes museums and collections museums
31,Gurkha Memorial Museum,"Pokhara, Nepal",This institution honors Nepal’s most storied warriors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gurkha-memorial-museum,"Fighting under the code that “it is better to die than be a coward,” the world-famous Gurkha soldiers first came to prominence during the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-1816. This museum first opened in 2005 and celebrates the international achievements of this elite force through two centuries of paintings, photographs, and artifacts. The 1st King George’s Own Gurkha Rifles was the inaugural Gurkha regiment formed by the British in 1815 from defectors of the Anglo-Nepalese War (although they actually served under the authority of the East India  Company). They have served in nearly every British campaign since. The Gurkhas officially became members of the British Indian Army during the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857, and since then have campaigned in Afghanistan, Russia, China, Malaysia, Burma, among many others in addition to serving with distinction in both world wars. The Anglo-Nepalese War also introduced the world to the now-iconic Khukuri knife (commonly called the Gurkha knife), many of which are on display in the museum.  Its unique design with a distinctively curved blade makes it an efficient slashing weapon. It is, however, mostly used as a utility knife, and in addition to being standard British issue, it can be used effectively to cook. Another iconic symbol of the Gurkha troops is the Queen’s Truncheon, a copy of which is prominently exhibited. The six-foot-tall bronze and silver truncheon was a gift from Queen Victoria following meritorious service during the Sepoy Rebellion, and is carried on parade by the Truncheon Jemadar. As additional recognition, Queen Victoria appointed two Gurkha officers to attend the monarch at every official event, a tradition that continues to this day. The museum is appropriately located in Pokhara, where every recruit begins his journey. Each year, more than 6,000 young men try out for the Gurkhas, but only 400 are chosen. The most grueling test is the infamous “Doko race” during which candidates must run 3 miles (5 kilometers) at high altitude up the Himalayan foothills carrying 55 pounds of rocks on their backs in under 45 minutes. Compared to the initiation trials, Gurkhas usually find basic training in the British Army a breeze. The might and courage exhibited by these world-class soldiers once prompted Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw to remark that “if a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or is a Gurkha.”  The museum's hours are 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m.",military history military history & culture museums
32,Nepali Folk Musical Instrument Museum,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This secluded museum beats the drum for the preservation of Nepal's musical heritage.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nepali-folk-musical-instrument-museum,"Nepal’s more than 100 distinct ethnic groups have produced over 1,300 different designs of musical instruments, a fact that struck a chord with Ram Prasad Kadel who began collecting Nepali instruments in 1995. Today, he showcases a significant portion of his impressive collection of some 650 instruments in a museum he opened in 2002. Although Kadel is not a musician himself, he is dedicated to telling the story of Nepal’s musical traditions in a sustainable way. A key element to building his collection is that he has not removed playable instruments from the 77 districts he has visited in Nepal, preferring to purchase decommissioned instruments or have local artisans craft new models. To avoid overwhelming his guests with the scale of his collection, Kadel breaks down his tour into nine categories of instruments. One notable example stands at the museum’s entrance, where visitors are met by an astonishingly large saarangi, an iconic traditional stringed Nepali instrument. It’s believed to be the world’s largest saarangi. Many of the instrument’s shapes and sounds are inspired by the natural surroundings of Nepali. Although many of the instruments are preserved behind glass, some are displayed openly and Kadel often showcases their sounds. A serpentine trumpet known as a naagbell is a favorite of school groups. Other instruments are available for professional musicians to play, and Kadel regularly invites performers to give public concerts and make recordings as part of his mission to preserve Nepal’s musical heritage. Fittingly, the museum is housed in the Tripureshwor Mahadev Temple complex, a towering cultural landmark. Located near the banks of the Bagmati River, it was built in 1818 by the impressively talented Queen Tripurasundari in memory of her deceased husband, King Rana Bahadur Shah. With three tiers, the temple is considered the largest in Kathmandu and is brimming with exceptional artistry, craftsmanship, and cultural relics. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Music Museum of Nepal.  The temple complex is currently undergoing renovations from the 2015 earthquake.

33,Maitighar Mandala,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Hiding in plain sight near Kathmandu’s government center is a giant mandala that has become a locus for political protest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maitighar-mandala,"Hiding in plain sight near Kathmandu’s government center is a giant mandala that has become a central location for political protest. Every day, thousands of commuters drive past an outsized tribute to Nepal’s rich Buddhist heritage. Lying in a traffic circle near Singha Durbar, the Nepali government palace, the recessed mandala is difficult to observe from street level while trying to negotiate the heavy traffic. However, it has played a central role in the civic life of the city. Constructed in 2001, the mandala was part of a larger Kathmandu beautification project inaugurated prior to the 11th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit. Measuring approximately 50’ x 50’, the mandala’s design has a series of concentric circles inscribed within a square. It features images of vajras, a ritual weapon symbolizing the power of a thunderbolt, and lotus petals which symbolize purity. The name Maitighar translates to “maternal home,” and derives from a famous movie of the same name that played at a theater that once stood on the same spot. Due to its proximity to many government buildings, Maitighar Mandala has been the site of numerous protests, especially during the civil war and Maoist insurgency. Other important civic events have been held here including in 2017, when KP Sharma Oli, who was later elected prime minister, hosted the Nepal Patriotic Youth Society. At that event, the largest Nepali flag ever made was raised. The flag measured 32 feet (10 meters) tall and weighed more than 17 pounds (8 kilograms). In 2018, the government prohibited gatherings at the mandala ostensibly because such events interfered with traffic. Nevertheless, demonstrations and other events have continued. The term “mandala” is simply the Sanskrit word for “circle,” and they are used both for teaching and healing.  Although they are originally Buddhist in origin, mandalas are also used by Hindus and Jains for meditation. Mandala designs can be deeply intricate and complex, but generally describe the cycles of life and one’s journey through the universe.  The Maitighar Mandala is located in a traffic island at the intersection of Thapathali, New Baneshwor, and Bhadrakali roads at the southeast corner of Singha Durbar.",landmarks religion sacred spaces history & culture
34,Mulkot Mirror Wall,"Purano Jhangajholi, Nepal",This twisty section of highway in the Himalayan foothills is lined with thousands of small mirrors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mulkot-mirror-wall,"Near the village of Mulkot Bazar, along a winding stretch of the BP Koirala Highway, a retaining wall is covered with thousands of small mirrors.  The mirrors are offered up to the goddess Seti Devi Mata as prayers to avoid accidents. A nearby temple sells additional mirrors to any travelers who wish to add to the panoramic oblation. Also known as the Banepa Sindhuli Bardibas Road, this 98 mile-long highway connects the Kathmandu Valley with the Eastern Terai. Although it is a relatively short highway, the design challenges of carving a road through the landslide and earthquake-prone Himalayan foothills account for the lengthy construction time—19 years in total.  The Japanese government designed and funded the highway’s construction with a grant assistance program. Today, the highway is regarded as one of the best-built roads in Nepal, as well as one of Asia’s most dangerous. It takes four to five hours to drive the highway. The drive offers unparalleled views of Nepal’s landscape (assuming one does not become part of that landscape in the process). Stopping to appreciate the mirrors is tricky since the road has no shoulder. And anyone who does try to make the stop will inevitably be faced with the incessant honking of drivers warning you they’re speeding around the bend. But no matter what, any drive along this road will leave you with the sense that you have traveled through the looking glass.  Given that there's no shoulder along the BP highway, please use extreme caution if you plan to stop at this site.",highways hinduism walls roads temples transportation roadside attractions
35,Thapathali Durbar Temple,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This is one of the last surviving structures of a once vast palace complex.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thapathali-durbar-temple,"Central Kathmandu, in an area north of the Bagmati River, once teemed with elaborate palace complexes built by kings and prime ministers. Today, with the exception of the famous and touristy Durbar Square, many of those palaces have been repurposed or destroyed by time and earthquakes. One of the most impressive estates was Thapathali Durbar, home of the Thapas. Construction of the palace began around the turn of the 18th-century under the orders of Nain Singh Thapa, an influential general and grandfather of the powerful prime minister, Jung Bahadur Rana. Thapa barely lived to age 30, dying after being wounded in battle. Later generations expanded the family home to an impressive degree. As the Thapa/Rana family fortunes and power declined, other palaces became the center of Kathmandu society and government. Eventually, a large portion of the palace was converted into a hospital and one of the primary buildings was refitted to serve as the Nepal Rastra Bank. This temple to Shiva, now the centerpiece for a small Newar community, is one of the last original palace structures left. Surrounded by outdoor stoves, rambunctious children, barking dogs, and an abundance of drying laundry, this building hardly proclaims a stately past, but it has withstood the test of time. A few blocks south, on the banks of the Bagmati River is the more notable Kal Mochan Temple, completed by Jung Bahadur Rana just outside the walls of Thapathali Durbar. Although one can still see the impressive dome of Kal Mochan from various points of the city, it is in fact a reconstruction since the original was destroyed in the earthquake of 2015. Somewhat ironically, Kal Mochan was dedicated to Vishnu “The Preserver” while the temple to Shiva “The Destroyer” still stands.  Although Thapathali Durbar can be found on maps, the temple is a bit hard to find. The only public entrance is on the west side of the community along a very narrow road. Locals will be able to help with directions.",palaces temples ruins
36,Langtang Village Memorial,"Helambu, Nepal",This memorial honors a village that was destroyed during a 2015 earthquake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/langtang-memorial,"Saturday, April 25, 2015, was a devastating day for Nepal. At 11:56 a.m., an 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck the Gorkha District, about 60 miles west of Kathmandu. The quake killed some 9,000 people throughout Nepal. Around 243 of those unfortunate souls were visiting or living in the village of Langtang, which was almost completely annihilated by a landslide. Situated in a valley at over 11,000 feet above sea level, Langtang was a popular teahouse community for trekkers exploring the Himalayas near Nepal’s border with Tibet. Views of the looming mountain, Langtang Lirung, and numerous exquisite glacial lakes made the hike through Langtang National Park irresistible. However, the extraordinary natural beauty belies unimaginable danger, as one of those lakes collapsed during the earthquake which caused around 40 million tons of rock to cascade into the valley. Only one structure sheltered by a cave and a handful of older residents survived the disaster, which seems miraculous given the enormity of the debris field. The mile-wide swath of destruction also managed to wipe out the river that flowed through the valley. Sitting atop the rubble now stands a memorial in the style of a Buddhist mani wall. The name derives from the mantra om mani padme hum, which is recited in appeal to Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of compassion. The names of the victims are inscribed on the wall above as colorful Buddhist flags flutter in the wind. Today, the area has started to recover a bit and trekkers have returned to the trail, although they stop at other villages for tea and to rest before tackling the remainder of the hike. But for a few moments, they pause reflectively at the Langtang Village Memorial to consider the awesome power of the ever-changing Himalayas.  Although the Langtang trek is considered one of Nepal's easier trails, it still takes two days of upward hiking to reach the memorial.",natural disaster earthquakes mountains memorials
37,Stone Cutters' Row,"Lalitpur, Nepal",An ancient art form is kept alive in this corner of Nepal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-cutters-row,"Chiseled into the side streets of Lalitpur, just south of Patan Durbar Square, are dozens of workshops featuring one of Nepal’s oldest crafts. The skills needed to carve the distinctive Nepali black limestone are handed down from generation to generation, and some of the artists in Stone Cutters’ Row can trace their artistic heritage back more than 500 years. Today, the two primary forms of sculpting are traditional and modern, and the sculptures in Stone Cutters’ Row are almost entirely traditionally rendered using little more than hand-held hammers and chisels. The 2,000-year-old stone sculpture of Yaksha Bodhisattva housed in the National Museum in Kathmandu is the first example of this artistic tradition, and it was done using mostly the same techniques on display in Lalitpur. Historically, craftsmen during the Licchavi period (4th-century CE) were noted for their artistry, which even modern masters have not been able to duplicate. Later, during the Malla period, kings were so protective of stone carving skills that they routinely cut off the hands of artisans to prevent neighboring monarchs from luring them away. Local lore recounts the story of one carver so gifted that after having both hands cut off, he continued to carve with his feet. Not surprisingly, artisans were reluctant to take up the trade, and by the late 20th-century, it was estimated that only about five families remained stewards of the craft. A resurgence of interest in stone carving began in the 1990s as Nepal opened to tourists, and although some modern power tools are now used to keep up with demand, 75 percent of the work is still done the old-fashioned way. Today, there are perhaps 20 families engaged in the trade and efforts continue to formally teach stone-craft to younger generations in art schools. As traditional works, sculptures are all made from the same limestone mined from the Chandragiri Hills, and the designs are largely the same from shop to shop. They primarily feature animal effigies (both real and mythical), water spigots, stupas, linga (the curiously phallic symbol of Shiva), and stelae featuring any number of different deities. True masters produce more imaginative and intricate works, sometimes in epic proportions weighing over one ton. So if original Nepali artwork is your quarry, don’t seek out typical bore-ing souvenirs. Be boulder and head to Lalitpur where you will likely find some real gems.  To find Stone Cutters' Row, start at the main entrance to Patan Durbar Square and walk south-east on the main road. After about half a mile, the street will begin to narrow and you will start to see workshops on both sides of the road. Some are hidden in alleys and nooks. The row extends for perhaps less than a mile.",sculptures history & culture art
38,Kudan Archaeological Site,"Kapilvastu, Nepal",The site where Sakyamuni Buddha first met his father after achieving enlightenment.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kudan-archaeological-site,"Set back from the main road heading north from India to Kapilvastu, Nepal, is a seemingly unremarkable pile of bricks adorning a nondescript field.  It would be easy to drive past this spot without further investigation, but that would be a regrettable decision since this is a site burgeoning with historical and religious significance. Now known as Kudan after the nearby village, the site is believed to be the Nigrodharam Bihar mentioned in Buddhist texts where Buddha met his father, King Suddhodhana, for the first time following his enlightenment. The site is located nearly six kilometers (3.7 miles) south of Buddha’s childhood home, the palace at Tilaurakot. Kudan served as a meeting place for Buddha’s followers and also hosted the ordination of his son, Rahula, an event commemorated by a stupa erected atop the tallest hill. Consequential theological debates were also held at Kudan, including whether women ought to be ordained.  Although Buddha initially rejected this proposal, his step-mother, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, prevailed upon him and became the first bhikkhuni, or Buddhist nun. The excavation of the Bihar (“home”) began in 2007, revealing original stone and brickwork. The site contains several ancillary structures including a well, several stupas, and the remains of a large pond. The Bihar itself stands 22 feet high and measures over 15,000 square feet in area. A dubious staircase takes intrepid explorers to the top of the Bihar for an unparalleled view of the entire site as well as to the locus of a well-worn Shiva linga. Although many of the specific details about Buddha’s life and the initial spread of his philosophy are shrouded in legend, the site’s original name—Nigrodharam—derives from Nigrodha, the name of a Buddhist monk who purportedly once owned the banyan grove where the Bihar was built. In the third century B.C., Nigrodha is said to have converted Emperor Ashoka Maurya to Buddhism who became one of Buddhism’s most powerful champions. Today, stone pillars erected by Ashoka can still be found in nearby Nepali villages and cities celebrating the Buddha. Kudan is, therefore, a good starting point for any enthusiastic pilgrim to retrace the footsteps of the Buddha and his followers.  To get the best experience in Kudan, it is a good idea to hire a knowledgeable guide as interpretive signage is limited and unreadable in some cases.",stupas buddha buddhism archaeology sacred spaces
39,Ganatantra Smarak,"Kathmandu, Nepal","Adjacent to Narayanhiti Palace, this park commemorates those who fought in Nepal's civil war.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ganatantra-smarak-republic-memorial,"Nepal’s civil war, also known as the Maoist Insurgency, lasted for over ten years before the monarchy was abolished, giving rise to the People’s Republic. Today, a four-and-a-half-acre park near the Narayanhiti Palace Museum commemorates those who fought and witnessed the falling of the world’s last Hindu kingdom. The road to democracy began long before the Civil War. In 1951, power was seized from the oligarchical Rana family and the first democratically elected government was established in 1959. When the Nepali Congress allied itself with the United Left Front in 1990 to push for democratic reforms, communist groups coalesced around alternative reform policies and the nation began a slow march toward armed conflict. Ultimately, China supported the Maoist revolutionaries, while the U.S., U.K., and Belgium supported the opposition, an extension of the Great Game that played out across Central and South Asia for centuries. Much like the new republic, the memorial itself was the result of political battles and years of tumult. After the cornerstone was laid in 2012, government agencies began to squabble over whose stories the memorial would tell, what it would stand for, and who would manage it. Disagreements and countless adjustments to park designs slowed construction—a symptom, and perhaps direct result of, uncertainty over Nepal’s emerging identity. A massive earthquake hit in April of 2015, followed by a blockade of materials from India, further delaying the completion of the park. It finally opened to the public in the spring of 2020. Today, the park features gardens, pools, stone walkways, and a giant elliptical structure on pedestals representing the four cardinal directions and memorializing those who were killed or injured during the revolution. The park lies adjacent to Narayanhiti Palace—a symbolic location, given that the massacre of the Royal Family in 2001 at the palace paved the way for the collapse of the monarchy and the establishment of the republic.   The park is open to the public from 5:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. each day.",memorials parks
40,Indreshwar Mahadev Temple Complex and Museum,"Panauti, Nepal",One of the largest pagodas in Nepal is a 13th century testament to regional craftsmanship.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/indreshwar-mahadev-temple-complex-and-museum,"One of the largest Newari pagoda-style wooden temples in Nepal, the triple-tiered Indreshwar Temple dates back to 1294. It took nearly 90 years to complete, has been renovated several times over the centuries, and has survived numerous earthquakes including the devastating 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Its architectural strength derives—perhaps in part—from its northeastern cornerstone, which is said to be the cursed disembodiment of the divine Ahalya. Although Ahalya’s story varies widely from text to text, she is generally described as being the most beautiful woman in the world, created by the god Brahma himself. In the most common retelling of her fate, she was married to Gautama Maharishi but was tricked and seduced by Indra, the king of heaven. For her infidelity, she was turned to stone. Whatever the source of the temple’s staying power might be, it towers over the confluence of the Rosi and Punyamati rivers and serves as both a village landmark and an important spiritual center to the small settlement of Panauti—by some measures, one of the oldest towns in Nepal. Regardless of age, Panauti’s architecture shows distinct cultural influences from Bhaktapur and is one of the best-preserved centers of Newari craftsmanship, exemplified nowhere more majestically than the Indreshwar Temple. Unfortunately, since the town lies well off the main east-west highway that cuts across Nepal, Panauti is often overlooked except by devoted pilgrims. The Newari people have inhabited the Kathmandu Valley for many centuries. While they are the sixth-largest ethnic group in the country, their cultural contributions—particularly in architecture—continue to be highly emblematic of the broader Nepalese aesthetic. The wood and brickwork at Indreshwar Temple are especially fine examples of Newari craftsmanship, and the small museum next to the temple teems with other intriguing examples of the area’s artistic heritage, from brassware to woodcarvings, statuary, and beyond.",hinduism woodwork crafts temples ancient
41,Koshi Barrage,"Bhardaha, Nepal","This structure, built more than 60 years ago to manage devastating seasonal floods, is known to attract a rare species of freshwater dolphin.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koshi-barrage,"Beginning high up in Tibet and snaking its way through Nepal and India, the Koshi River eventually empties into the storied Ganges near the town of Kursela after a journey of 450 miles. Notoriously fickle about its exact path, the river is often called “the Sorrow of Bihar” because of its devastating floods during monsoon season near Bihar, India. This prompted the building of a barrage (aka a weir or sluice) near Nepal’s border with India in the late 1950s. Equipped with 56 gates spaced across a 1,150-meter (3,772-foot) expanse, the barrage has had some success managing the temperamental waterway, although Nepal’s largest river will likely never be completely tamed— in the past 100 years alone it has moved nearly 150 kilometers (93 miles) laterally. The barrage was designed to last for 25 years, but more than 60 years later, a more permanent structure has yet to be built. The fragility of the barrage was revealed in 2008 when the eastern embankment collapsed, causing a major flood that left more than 3 million people homeless. Although the barrage is entirely within Nepal’s borders, India has the sole responsibility to maintain it, and funds are customarily scarce for repairs and upkeep. Nevertheless, the barrage has performed admirably despite being well past its prime and having to withstand pressure from up to 135 million tons of silt each year. The barrage has also become something of a noted social venue for fishermen, tourists, birdwatchers, locals, and endangered Ganges River dolphins, which position themselves in front of the open flood gates to catch funneled fish. These dolphins are essentially blind since the silt-filled water is too opaque for them to rely on sight. They are distinctive in many other ways as well, possessing elongated beaks and flippers, a slightly unsettling misshapen appearance, and occasionally a pinky hue. Spectacularly shy and rare (only approximately 2,000 dolphins are known to exist in the Ganges and Indus River systems), one can stand on the Koshi Barrage and easily spot at least half a dozen at a time feeding and playing. As such, being barraged by dolphins makes a visit worthwhile.  Driving the East-West Highway westward from Itahari, Nepal to the barrage, travelers will cross the Indian border briefly, but no visa is required as there is no checkpoint.",dolphins floods engineering rivers water
42,Kumari Ghar,"Kathmandu, Nepal",A brick building in Kathmandu's Durbar Square is home to Nepal's most prominent living goddess.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kumari-ghar,"Every day visitors, tourists, and worshipers alike gather in the courtyard below the balcony of the Kumari Ghar, hoping to catch a glimpse of a living goddess. The Kumari (literally “virgin”) is believed to be the reincarnation of the Hindu warrior goddess Taleju, a manifestation of Durga. Buddhists, on the other hand, believe her to be the tantric goddess Vajradevi. Nepal has several Kumaris, but Kumari Devi, or the Royal Kumari, is the most famous. Selected in early childhood from the Newar Buddhist Sakhya caste of goldsmiths and silversmiths, potential candidates are placed in a darkened room with freshly severed buffalo heads and dancing men wearing demon masks. It is believed if one candidate is not frightened, as most young girls surely would be, she is the next reincarnation of Taleju. Once chosen, she moves into the Kumari Ghar, where her feet will never touch the ground and she’ll only leave during specific festivals and religious duties. Each day, however, she makes occasional appearances from her balcony where crowds below wait to see her. As soon as she begins menstruating, or loses blood from an injury, she reverts back to mortal status and re-enters society, as the selection process begins again. The Kumari Ghar was built in 1757 by King Jaya Prakash Malla when he was overcome in guilt after offending the current Royal Kumari. In an act of atonement, he built her a new home. It was renovated in 1966.  The Kumari Ghar is located near the south entrance of Durbar Square in Kathmandu. The best time to see the living goddess is between 9-11 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. No photography or video is allowed of Kumari. There's a small entrance fee to visit Durbar Square, but no additional fee to visit Kumari Ghar.",warriors hinduism gods buddhism temples sacred spaces
43,"Ashoka Pillar, Lumbini","Lumbini Sanskritik, Nepal",Designed to honor the birthplace of Buddha.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ashoka-pillar-lumbini,"One of the most prolific bumper sticker and t-shirt slogans in Nepal is “Buddha was born in Nepal.” Although he is often associated with India where he lived and traveled extensively, or with Tibet where his influence is keenly felt, Siddhartha Gautama Buddha is widely believed to have been born in Lumbini, Nepal, where his nascency is majestically celebrated. Standing just outside the renowned Maya Devi Temple in the Lumbini gardens is the Ashoka pillar commemorating this transcendent event. Buddha’s exact year of birth is disputed, but it is acknowledged that the pillar was erected at least 300-400 years after his existence by the emperor Ashoka in the year 249 BCE. Ashoka ruled over most of present-day India as head of the Mauryan Empire, which was founded on and expanded through violent and bloody conquest by Ashoka and his predecessors. But it is said that he converted to Buddhism and a life dedicated to non-violence when a widow of one of the vanquished revealed to him the extent of his brutality. Thus chastened, Ashoka embarked on pilgrimages to seek out and honor sacred Buddhist sites and erected a series of pillars at each place to memorialize his own dedication, as well as the sanctity of Buddha. Some 19 pillars are currently known, and most are in India, but the one in Lumbini holds the greatest significance. The pillar is mentioned in several ancient texts and is believed to have been repaired and re-erected at some point in the 11th or 12th-century. It was re-discovered by Nepali archaeologists in 1896 and has since been refurbished once again. Written in Brahmi script, the pillar’s inscription is said to be the oldest in Nepal and reads: “King Piyadasi (Ashoka), the beloved of Devas, in the 29th year of the coronation, made a visit to Lumbini and paid his homage. Realising the Buddha was born here, a stone railing was built and a stone pillar erected. Because the Lord was born here, the Emperor had the people of Lumbini village freed from some tax and entitled them to the eighth part only.” In addition to the Maya Devi Temple which houses archaeological indicia of Buddha’s birth, the vast Lumbini gardens are populated with numerous temples, monasteries, stupas, and monuments built by countries from around the world in the 20th and 21st-centuries. But the Ashoka Pillar remains the most totemic tribute.  Visitors to Lumbini should plan at least a full-day tour with a guide. For dedicated enthusiasts of Nepali culture and Buddhism, two or more days may be better. Since Lumbini is located in the Terai region of Nepal, the weather can be uncomfortably warm and humid, so be sure to carry water and sunscreen.",religion history & culture architecture

The Women’s Development Center is dedicated to advancing women’s empowerment through the promotion of the 2,800-year-old Mithila artistic tradition. Sometime after the 9th-century in the Videhas Kingdom of Nepal, the distinctive two-dimensional Mithila style of art began to emerge. Originally, the artwork was painted on the mud walls of homes in the Terai region—as it still is in some sections of the Kuwa district—particularly during the Diwali festival. Unlike other traditional painting styles like mandalas and thangkas that primarily use religious symbols and themes, Mithila art incorporates images from daily life, particularly focused on the lives of women. In the 1970s, wall art made its way to the paper and canvas, and in 1989, the Women’s Development Center opened as a first of its kind endeavor to employ women from surrounding villages to produce original artwork. Today, approximately 40 women work at the center to learn various art techniques and business practices, while producing paintings, ceramics, screen-prints, and other handicrafts for the international art market. Although democratic reforms in the past 25 years have sought to improve the lives of Nepali women, many laws designed to promote equal rights go unenforced in a nation that has been deeply patriarchal for centuries. The Women’s Development Center is now one of many organizations throughout Nepal that seeks to help women take control of their lives through better education and economic empowerment.

Barju Taal, sometimes called Chimdi Taal, is comprised of just over 250 acres of wetlands but hosts more than 500 bird species, and at peak festival times hosts up to 150,000 picnickers. The lake is partially handcrafted and undergoes periodic improvements to accommodate the ever-burgeoning collection of visitors. While birding is a popular activity, there are also miles of trails worth hiking that lead into nearby villages where one can visit with the local Tharu population. No trip to Barju is complete without scoping out the regional farmlands that the lake supports and learning about Tharu culture. Boating is also a popular activity on the lake, although signs warn would-be mariners against “alcoholic paddling.” Swimming likewise is not permitted, but signs are unnecessary given the prevalence of water snakes. The lake has a broader influence beyond recreation and conservation as it is a prominent location mentioned in the Mahabharata, the epic tale about the Kurukshetra War and the world’s longest poem. It was here that the five Pandava princes are said to have stopped for water and engaged in a long philosophical dialogue known as the “Legend of the Virtuous Crane.”  As of November 2021, parts of the lake are undergoing restoration and are dominated more by earthmovers than by birds.

And though crowds are sparse, it refuses to close its doors. Most of the rides in this rickety operation seem to be falling apart at the seams, though the roller coaster, merry-go-round, and train ride are functional. Local farmers regularly test the rides. Allegedly, when foreign journalists visit the park, they are commonly kept on a bus until local residents can be rounded up to make the place look at least a little bit livelier. It’s also said that these foreign visitors are allowed to go on the rides first, for publicity purposes. While the local-tested rides are bundles of fun, it’s not all rusty carousels and roller coasters. You can also enjoy some good, old-fashioned amusement park fun at the shooting gallery, where everyone gets the chance to enjoy taking aim at some imperialist aggressors. Kim Jong-un inspected the park in 2011, and needless to say, Supreme Commander was not pleased.

47,Ryugyong Hotel,"Pyongyang, North Korea","North Korea's massive ""hotel of doom.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ryugyong-hotel,"This 300-meter-high skyscraper would be an imposing presence in any city’s skyline. In Pyongyang, North Korea it dwarfs every other structure in sight, dominating not only the skyline but the city itself. It is North Korea’s largest building, and yet it remains for the moment, unfinished. In 1986, a South Korean Group completed the construction of the 226-meter-tall Westin Stamford Hotel in Singapore, at the time the most ambitious construction project ever undertaken by a Korean company. The communist leadership of the North wanted to prove that its own engineers were capable of constructing a building on an even more grandiose scale. Baekdu Mountain Architects & Engineers started construction on the tower in 1987. Its name translates to “capital of willows” and it was a historic moniker of Pyongyang. The building consists of three triangular sections, each 100 meters long. The sections converge at the summit, giving an overall pyramidal outline to the structure. It is a gigantic building containing roughly 360,000 square meters, roughly 67 football fields, of floor space. At the apex of the hotel is a 40-meter-tall, eight-floor conical structure, which was supposed to house seven revolving restaurants. The hotel’s original plans called for 3,000 rooms, as well as plenty of space for additional commercial venues. According to the original plan, the hotel was supposed to open in 1989, however, construction problems forced the government to postpone its opening several times. In the early 1990s, multiple problems hit the project. Poor quality materials, electricity shortages, and a widespread famine in the country all became serious obstacles to the completion of the building. Expected foreign investments never materialized. Finally, in 1992, construction was halted. Japanese sources estimate that over the course of its construction, the project swallowed over two percent of North Korea’s GDP, or roughly 750 million US dollars. The hotel’s empty shell was left standing empty for 16 years. Due to the financial burden the project placed on the already starving nation, and the drab and menacing look of the naked concrete structure, foreign media dubbed the hotel the “World’s Worst Building” and the “Hotel of Doom.” Nevertheless, work resumed in 2008, and a slick glass facade was installed and finished by 2011. The new official date for the opening of the Hotel was set for 2012, on the 100th anniversary of the birth of the Great Leader Kim Il Sung. Plans ground to a halt for a second time in March 2013, when the company that expressed interest in running the hotel pulled out; likely in response to North Korea’s nuclear tests. As of 2016, the building remains closed.",places to stay outsider architecture hotels
48,North Korea's International Friendship Exhibition Hall,"North Pyongan Province, North Korea",A bizarre collection of gifts to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il from the despots of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/north-koreas-international-friendship-exhibition-hall,"If you are an iron-fisted despot or terrorist organization, what do you get another tyrannical dictator as a gift? It would seem, judging from North Korea’s “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” that going with a dead animal is always a safe bet. Located in the UN recognized biosphere reserve of Mount Myohyang, North Korea’s “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” is an exercise in contradictions. First off, for North Korea, one of the most isolated countries in the world, having an “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” itself is a bit of a contradiction. In essence, it amounts to an enormous collection of gifts given to Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il by various other communist, terrorist, and despotic regimes. Among the over 100,000 items gifted to the Kims are: Green railway cars from Mao and Stalin, a bronze tank from the USSR headquarters in East Germany, a gold cigarette case from Yugoslavia’s Tito,a 25-watt boombox from the People’s Republic of China Communist Party which seems kind of cheap, considering, a gem-encrusted silver sword and reproduction of a Moslem mosque from Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat, and an antique gramophone from China’s first premier Zhou Enlai. This isn’t to say the US has never given anything. Yet another of the contradictions of the “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” is that gifts have indeed been given by the democratic western world, albeit only a few, and are proudly displayed. The circumstances of the gifts from the US are unknown and probably date to Kim Il Sung’s era, but include a book, vase, and mirror, three pewter and silver pieces, and two homemade art objects. One can’t help but wonder who made these “art objects” and what they could possibly be. Among the other gifts from the west is a basketball signed by Micheal Jordan, and given (for what reason it is unclear) by Madeleine Albright. One of the more bizarre gifts are perfect copies of the black limousine cruisers seen in “The Untouchables” from Soviet leaders Georgy Malenkov and Nikolai Bulganina. Obviously less concerned with impressing North Korea, Gorbachev sent only a Glass vase with the Communist star on it. Mongolia sent silver chopsticks, while the Chairman of the Journalist Association of Kuwait sent a pen set. From various Industrialists trying to woo Kim Jong Il: a robot drink server, wooden mace, astronaut’s suit, Sony Walkman, Casio keyboard, Yamaha organ, football signed by Pele, and an old Apple computer – which seems like someone might have just been getting rid of their trash – and once again with a somewhat unimpressive display, a tiny rubber ashtray from the Hwabei Tire Factory in China. But by far the most popular theme for gifts given by one dictator to another is taxidermy. Fidel Castro gave a crocodile-skin briefcase, and Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator who was overthrown and killed by his own people, gave a bear head mounted on a red satin pillow. Lebanon gave Water buffalo-horn handles and the president of Tanzania gave an ivory lion. The National Black United Front gave Kim a small butterfly collection, at some point Canada gave North Korea a polar bear skin, and someone gave a tiger claw positioned as to be tearing through an American map. Of course, the most creative and unusual of the gifts belongs not to a dictator or even a head of state, but naturally, a revolutionary. The Sandinistas of Nicaragua donated an upright grinning alligator, holding out a wooden tray of cocktail glasses. It comes with a matching ashtray. While to an outsider the museum represents a bizarre collection, with a remarkable amount of kitsch, ashtrays, and uninteresting consumer goods, it is not outsiders that are the intended audience. North Koreans have almost no contact with the outside world, and this is one place in which they are allowed to see many of the goods from around the world. The aim is to convince them that their leaders are universally admired and lavished with gifts. One of the hall’s guards is quoted as having noted the basketball signed by Micheal Jordan and saying “When the general plays with that ball, it proves that he controls the whole world in his hands.” For that North Korean Guard, Kim Jong Un, like his father and grandfather, really does hold the whole world in his hands.",hunting and taxidermy follies and grottoes cultures and civilizations rites and rituals collections museums and collections
49,Mansu Hill Grand Monument,"Pyongyang, North Korea",A giant bronze monument to Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il is one of the most sacred sites in North Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mansu-hill-grand-monument,"On Mansu Hill in North Korea’s capital city, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stand a staggering 20 meters of bronze. This memorial monument allows the Great Leaders—who are immortal in the eyes of the people—to be remembered forever. It is one of the most sacred places in the DPRK. As such, visitors are expected to show the correct visiting etiquette—purchasing flowers to lay at the giant statues’ feet, marching in solemn line, hand by your sides and bowing. Photographs of just part of the monument are forbidden and considered insulting; photos must be framed to include the entire monument. Kim Il-sung—the one with his arm outstretched away from the 70-meter-wide mosaic of Mount Paektu— was the original monument, unveiled in 1972 to celebrate the leader’s 60th birthday. (Reportedly the statue was originally covered in gold leaf, but was changed to the less expensive bronze at the insistence of China.)  After his death, the leader’s son, Kim Jong-il joined him in bronze. On either side of the two Great Leaders, there are enormous stones with KWP flags and 228 bronze figures all standing at 5 meters high. This sculpture is symbolic of the socialist revolution and the struggle against North Korea’s imperialist enemies, the Japanese. The American enemies are not forgotten either; they have a slogan dedicated to them: “Let us drive out US imperialism and reunify the country.”",communist monuments communism monuments statues

There were two brewers, two engineers, and eight government officials. They were all from North Korea, and they had come to take the brewery. Their leader, Kim Jong Il (nicknamed “Kim Jong Ale” by the residents of Trowbridge), had recently decided that North Korea needed a better state-run brewery. But instead of building a brewery from scratch, the North Korean leader decided to go shopping for one. For £1.5 million, North Korea bought the 175-year-old Ushers of Trowbridge Brewery. A team of Russians came in to entirely dismantle the brick-walled factory, then the North Koreans shipped all four million pounds of it back to Pyongyang. The crew left nothing, taking every vat, keg, pipe, nut, bolt, tile, and toilet seat in the brewery. They wanted to take the brewmaster himself, but had to settle for just his knowledge. Korean translators spent weeks with him poring over beer-making schematics. A mere 18 months later, in 2002, the Russian team had reassembled the factory on a cabbage field in East Pyongyang. Since named the Taedonggang Brewing Company, the brewery produced seven styles of beer, named pragmatically from light pilsner “Beer Number One” (“Taedonggang 1”) to dark, chocolatey dunkel “Beer Number Seven.” (They have since added at least one more.) Taedonggang is considered some of the best beer available on the Korean Peninsula, and even within Asia. Despite the improved state-run brewing game, most North Koreans still prefer cheaper, harder stuff such as the local liquor, soju. Rural North Koreans must use food rations to buy beer, which makes it a luxury item few can afford. In the country’s capital, men receive beer vouchers (usually 1–2 liters a month) that can be redeemed in a Pyongyang bar. But for the most part, beer is still an urban, middle-class affair, more akin to a nice glass of wine than a party beverage. Although North Korea and the Taedonggang Brewing Company would like the world to focus on their surprisingly good beer, the brewery still remains the property of a mysterious and harsh dictatorship. In 2016, Pyongyang held its first-ever beer festival, which attracted 45,000 visitors. In 2017, however, the festival was canceled by the government without explanation.  For foreigners, your best bet is checking for tour operators that visit the brewery. Otherwise, Taedonggang's beers can sometimes be found—depending on the state of sanctions and international relations—in grocery stores in countries such as China.",dictator food projects dictators breweries beer

Pueblo is an American intelligence-gathering ship captured by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on January 23, 1968. The “Pueblo Crisis” was a major incident in the Cold War but remained little-known, as it was overshadowed a week later by the Tet Offensive attacks of the Vietnam War. At the time of the capture, North Korea stated that the ship had strayed into their territorial waters, but the United States maintained that the vessel was in international waters. The Pueblo was initially approached by a submarine chaser and its nationality challenged. The Pueblo responded by raising the U.S. flag. The DPRK vessel then ordered the crew to stand down or be fired upon. The Pueblo attempted to move away but was attacked by the sub chaser, three torpedo boats, and two MiG-21 fighter aircraft. The Pueblo was taken into port at Wonsan and the crew moved to POW camps; upon their release, some of the crew stated that they had been starved and regularly tortured while in North Korean custody. This treatment had worsened when the North Koreans realized that their prisoners were secretly giving them the finger in staged propaganda photos. Commander Lloyd M. Bucher, Commanding Officer of the Pueblo, was tortured and put through a mock firing squad ordeal in an effort to make him confess. Eventually the North Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented. On December 23, 1968—exactly 11 months after being taken prisoner—the crew was taken by buses to the DMZ border with South Korea and ordered to walk south across the “Bridge of No Return.” The Pueblo officially remains a commissioned vessel of the United States Navy and is currently moored along the Taedong River in Pyongyang. It is the only ship of the U.S. Navy currently being held “captive” and is now used as a war museum. Tours are officially conducted by military guides who refer to Americans as “U.S. Imperialist Aggressors,” and a propaganda video is shown prior to commencement of the tour in case any doubt remains. As with most sites of interest in North Korea this has to be organised officially.

There’s much more to Juche; it has been credited with creating the cult of personality surrounding North Korean leaders. It would later become known by another name: “Kimilsung-ism.” The Juche Tower was built in 1982 on the banks of the Taedong River in celebration of Kim Il-sung’s 70th birthday. As everything in North Korea is symbolic, the Juche Tower makes no exception. It’s comprised of 25,550 blocks—one for every day of Il-sung’s life. Some have even said that he was the architect of the grand monument to his own philosophy, but this is unlikely. The monolithic structure is reminiscent of the United States’ Washington Monument, and in fact, Juche Tower is considered to be in direct competition with the famed Washington, D.C. monument, as it is exactly one meter taller than the American obelisk. This makes it one of the highest monuments in the world, second only to Houston’s San Jacinto Monument. The tower is a popular tourist destination, where visitors can ride to the top in an elevator to view Pyongyang from above. For the heights-avoidant, there are videos displayed at the base of the tower explaining the monument’s significance to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to the philosophy of Juche, and to Eternal Leader Kim Il-sung.",north korean monuments communist monuments communist architecture communism towers

The symbol itself is of Chinese origin, a magical horse that is so fast, no man can mount it, being an Eastern allegory to the pegasus. The name even translates to “thousand-mile horse.” The symbol was introduced to North Korea by in 1956 by Kim Il-Sung, who used it as the mascot for his Chollima Workers Movement. The country was in need of rapid reconstruction following the Korean War, and Il Sung used the slogan, “Let us dash forward in the spirit of Chollima!” to invoke the mythical creature’s speed and perseverance over seemingly impossible goals. The campaign seemed to work too, leading to years of rapid reconstruction. Unfortunately, people are not magical tireless horses, and by the 1960s the movement had petered out for the most part. However, the Chomilla remains a popular icon in the country, even lending its name to the national football team.

The Arch of Triumph was officially opened on April 15, 1982 to mark the 70th birthday of Kim Il-sung, the first leader of North Korea. It was President Kim Il-sung who, according to North Korean history, led the Korean resistance to Japan from 1925 to 1945 (although he was only 13 in 1925). The arch was built on the site of Kim’s triumphant return to Pyongyang in 1945, marking the end of the Japanese occupation of the city. The Arch of Triumph is a vast structure, its imposing nature only enhanced by the relative isolation in which it sits, alone on an expansive square surrounded by roads that see little traffic. At 197 feet (60 m) high and 164 feet (50 m) wide, it’s the second tallest triumphal arch in the world after the Monumento a la Revolución in Mexico City. It’s also 33 feet taller than the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, upon which it was undoubtedly modeled. The arch is steeped in symbolism, with references to the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the Korean nation and, of course, Kim Il-sung. The structure is apparently made from 25,500 blocks of white granite, each one representing a day in the life of President Kim Il-sung up to his 70th birthday. On either side of the arch are the dates 1925 and 1945, referring to the period during which Kim spent in resistance to the Japanese. Also inscribed on the arch are the words of the revolutionary hymn “Song of General Kim Il-sung,” and 70 azalea reliefs representing each year of Kim’s life. Bronze statues on the arch pay homage to the three pillars of the Workers’ Party of Korea, showing workers, farmers and the intelligentsia, and the soldiers who fought for the Korean Revolutionary Army. Also represented is Mount Paektu, a sacred mountain that played a part in the fight against Japanese occupation (Kim Il-sung organized his resistance in the dense forests surrounding the mountain). Inside the Arch of Triumph, meanwhile, are a series of viewing platforms and rooms connected by elevators and stairs. From the top, visitors have impressive views across the surrounding neighborhood, Kim Il-sung Stadium and Moranbong Park.  The Arch of Triumph is located at the intersection of Moranbong Street, Chilsungmun Street and Kaesonmun Street in the Moranbong Distict of Pyongyang. The Kaeson Metro Station is located nearby. Some tourist buses coming from the airport into Pyongyang stop at the arch to let visitors have a quick walk around. Alternatively, you can arrange a tour to the arch once in Pyongyang.

However, little was known about this ancient culture until the 1920s, when a couple of long-buried cities were first excavated by modern archaeologists. One of these rediscovered sites was Mohenjo-Daro. The name Mohenjo-Daro, meaning “Mound of the Dead Men,” is a modern one, as the original city was anything but. Spreading over an area of 300 hectares (about 750 acres) with a peak population of about 40,000, Mohenjo-Daro was one of the largest and most advanced cities in the world during its time. Laid out in a rectilinear grid and built out of baked bricks, the city featured a complex water management system, complete with a sophisticated drainage and covered sewer system, and baths in nearly every house. The original name of the city is forgotten, although one scholar speculates it may have been Kukkutarma, or “The City of the Cockerel” (a.k.a., Rooster City). The uniform size of the manufactured bricks used to build Mohenjo-Daro, the discovery of standardized weights and measures used to facilitate trade, the considerable degree of civil engineering and urban planning evident in the city’s development, and the fact these characteristics are shared with other Indus-Sarasvati Valley sites (most notably Harappa, the first site to be excavated) suggest a highly organized civilization with bureaucratic coordination of things like construction and commerce. Given that, it is perhaps puzzling to note that Mohenjo-Daro does not seem to feature any palaces, temples, monuments, or anything else indicative of a seat of governing power. The city’s largest structures are things like public baths (including one that had an underground furnace to heat the pools), assembly halls, a marketplace, ancient apartment buildings, and the aforementioned sewer system — all things that suggest an emphasis on an orderly, clean, and modest civil society. Built around 2500 BCE, Mohenjo-Daro — like the rest of the Indus Valley Civilization — went into sudden decline for unknown reasons in 1900 BCE and was subsequently abandoned possibly because of the drying up of a major Sarawati River. After its rediscovery in the 1920s, a few decades of excavations were ultimately discovered to be exposing the ancient structures to considerably weather damage, and all further archaeological work on the site was halted in 1966; today, only salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects are allowed.",lost cities sewers urban planning ancient archaeology ruins
60,Attabad Lake,"Hunza Nagar, Pakistan",This dazzlingly turquoise mountain lake was created in the wake of a natural disaster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/attabad-lake,"On January 4, 2010, a massive landslide thundered down the sides of the remote Hunza Valley in the Gilgit Baltistan Region of Northern Pakistan. The village of Attabad was buried, killing 20 people and destroying 26 homes. The disaster, however, was far from over. The landslide had dammed the Hunza River, and the rapidly rising waters of the newly formed lake threatened villages both below and above the dam. The waters behind the newly formed natural dam soon rose to a depth of more than 300 feet, creating a lake that eventually measured 13 miles in length. As the lake grew, it displaced some 6,000 people from upstream villages and flooded a 12-mile stretch of the Karakoram Highway, leaving the region stranded. In May 2010, local authorities excavated a spillway to guide the flow over the dam. A month later, however, too much water was flowing over the landslide. Below the dam, lower Shishkat was completely submerged and Gulmit partly flooded. By August 2010, the spillway was beginning to perform well. But by that time, as many as 25,000 individuals had been affected, either as a result of the initial landslide, flooding, or due to the destruction of the highway. The government provided aid to the victims, but many remained in fear of further disaster. If the dam burst, 50,000 people living downstream could be in peril, as well as a road that served as an important trade link with China. Thankfully, the dam held. And from the disaster came an unexpected attraction that would eventually lead to a tourism boom in the area: Attabad Lake, a shimmering turquoise lake that is now one of the main attractions in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. The lake’s chilly waters are a stunning turquoise in spring and early summer, when meltwater from the surrounding mountains deposits glacial silt into the lake. In winter, the lake typically freezes over. Most visitors come to enjoy this spectacular landscape when the lake is ice-free. Various recreational activities take place on and around the lake, including boating, jet skiing, and fishing. And with the rise in tourism, an increasing number of hotels and guesthouses have sprung up around the lake, as well as a handful of campsites. Presumably, the influx of tourists has benefited many of the locals who were affected by the landslide. And now that the highway has been rebuilt with new tunnels, access is better than it was before. Still, if you take a boat out onto the calm surface of Attabad Lake, it’s strange to think that 300 meters below you sits a once-lively village. Now Attabad lake is one of the top tourist attraction points in Pakistan. However, with the level of water rising, the government of Pakistan is planning to build a dam around the lake.  Attabad Lake is about half an hour east of Karimabad, the capital of the Hunza District in the Gilgit-Baltistan province of Pakistan (Karimabad, incidentally, was named one of the five ""Best Tourist Sites"" in Pakistan by The Guardian).

61,Chaukhandi Tombs,"Karachi, Pakistan",Reputedly haunted sandstone necropolis with exquisite stone carvings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chaukhandi-tombs,"If you’re going to bury someone above ground, the container should probably be both secure and reverent. This knowledge seems to be almost instinctive, as ornate tombs and mausoleums can be found sheltering bodies above the surface in cemeteries from New Orleans to Timbuktu. The most famous of these tombs are clearly the great pyramids of Egypt, but other examples of respectful celebration through decoration are found the world over. The Chaukhandi Tombs near Karachi, Pakistan are a unique example of such burials. Buried south to north – unusual for the area and time period – these tombs are constructed out of huge sandstone slabs, which are delicately stacked into a finessed pyramid shape. The slabs were then clearly painstakingly carved with intricate patterns, drawings and relatable scenes. Built between the 15th and 18th centuries, the Chaukhandi Tombs now form a remarkably well-preserved necropolis that often attracts curious visitors and archeologists alike, but the area is not without foreboding legends. Beyond the elaborate decoration of the tombs, another feature the tombs seem to share with similar necropoli around the world is the conviction locals tend to have that the area is haunted. The tombs at Chaukhandi are renowned for being one of the most haunted sites in the region, and visitors are particularly warned against entering the graveyard at night. Avoiding the tombs at night isn’t bad advice, haunting or otherwise, because the details and drawings on these fascinating artifices are clearly best experienced in the broad light of day. A fact for which many visitors are likely very thankful.",memento mori catacombs and crypts ruins
62,Khewra Salt Mines,"Khewra, Pakistan","The world's second largest salt mine, said to have been discovered by Alexander the Great's horse.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khewra-salt-mines,"In 326 BC, Alexander the Great, the Greek King famous for conquering an empire ranging from Asia into Africa and Europe, was making his way across Pakistan. Stopping his army for a rest in the area now known as Khewra, Alexander’s horse began licking the stones on the ground. Seeing that all the horses were doing so and taking note, a soldier himself tried one and found that the rocks were quite salty. The Khewra salt deposits had been discovered. Today, some 2330 years later, the Khewra salt mines are the second largest in the world — behind the Sifto Canada, Inc., salt mine in Goderich, Ontario — turning out 325,000 tons of salt per year, and an estimated 220 million tons over its lifetime. This is barely even a dent in the massive salt stores here, which are said to be 6.687 billion tons. Officially, salt mining wasn’t recorded until the 1200s under the Janjua-Raja’ tribe, but salt has probably been mined and traded here since Alexander’s time. Covering an area of 110 sq. km, 228 meters or 748 feet deep (with 11 separate stories), the massive mine has over 40 kilometers of tunnels running some 730 meters, or nearly half a mile into the mountain under which the salt deposits are found. To keep the huge space from collapsing in on itself, only fifty percent of the salt found is mined; the other half serves as support columns to hold up the mine. With such a massive area, a large workforce, and the ease of carving and building with salt bricks, some interesting sights have been built within the salt mine. Among the earliest structure built within the mine is the small Badshahi Mosque, complete with a small salt minaret. Built more recently, specifically to attract tourists, are small salt versions of the Great Wall of China, the Mall road of Murree, Lahore’s Shimla hill, and the Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. Both the mosque and the miniatures are built from salt bricks, which vary in color from red to pink to white, and which are now lighted electrically and radiate a beautiful warm glow. At times, the many colors and bricks of light give the mine a sort of disco-Yellow-Brick-Road look. Other sights — and there are many — include a 75-meter-tall “assembly hall” chamber with stairs spiraling up the walls, a 25-foot-long Salt Bridge called the Pul-saraat (an allusion to the Islamic “Pul-e-Saraat,” a bridge you must cross on Judgment Day which is described as “thinner than a strand of hair and sharper than a sword”), brine ponds, and beautiful salt-crystal formations such as stalactites. Much of this can be seen from the narrow gauge electric railway, in place since the 1930s, which once extracted salt from the mines and now brings tourists into them. The Khewra salt mine even has its own fully functioning postal office, for use by the workers. The post office is built entirely from salt bricks and is the only post office built out of salt in the world. While a popular tourist destination today, the salt mines were the scene of brutal oppression and forced work by the British in the 1800s. Miners were locked into the mines and not allowed to leave until they fulfilled their quotas. This included pregnant women and children, and a number of children were born within the mine. Strikes were met with violence from the British, and in 1876, twelve minors were shot and killed at the entrance to the mines. Their graves can be seen at the middle gates of the mines. One can taste the output of this salt mine by going to their local grocery and looking for “Himalayan Salt,” a reddish or pink rock salt. It is significantly more delicious then your average table salt, and comes with a much more interesting back story. Motorway M2:The fastest way to reach Khewra mines is via motorway M2. The mines are located 30km east of Lilla interchange towards Pind Dadan Khan. Road signs are quite visible. Highway N5: A slower but scenic approach is also available from GT road?from Mandra.?Distances?from Mandra (0km)are:?Chakwal (63km), Choa Saidan Shah (93km) and Khewra (103km).

From around the 14th century through to the 18th century CE, the Thatta region was inhabited by local royalty who used Makli Hill as their communal burial site. Each new succession of rulers would build elaborate burial structures, often differing wildly from one another, creating a massive and varied cornucopia of historic graves unlike anything else on the planet. Kings, queens, scholars, holy men, and other figures of import are buried on the hilltop in their ornate stone tombs. Around 120,000 people are thought to be buried on the hill. Hindu, Islamic, Asian, and other styles can be picked out among the collection of tombs, which have been split into four distinct periods of creation corresponding to the ruling society of the time. Some of the tombs have tall columns, while others are decorated with sweeping arches. All together, the hill is like some sort of archaeological dreamscape.

As the Mughal Empire expanded across the Indian subcontinent in the 16th century, Lahore became an increasingly important stronghold. Its strategic location was key in tying the expanded Mughal territories to the fortified cities of Kabul, Multan, and Kashmir. The city’s fortress was built under the reign of Emperor Akbar between 1566-1605 and housed several Mughal (and later Sikh) rulers over the following centuries. The two sections of the fort are divided by usage - an administrative portion and a residential portion. The elephant stairs (or Hathi Paer) are part of the private entrance to the royal quarters, and effectively allowed royalty to ascend all the way to the doorway before dismounting. In order to accommodate the lumbering creatures, the stairs were designed with wide treads, but minimal height (a balking elephant can really dampen the mood of a procession). Although it’s been centuries since a herd of jewel and silk-laden elephants travelled several abreast along this sloping corridor, it was once certainly the most magnificent driveway in the world.",stairs fortresses
65,Tomb of Ali Mardan Khan,"Lahore, Pakistan","This grand Pakistani mausoleum can only be accessed via an almost 1,000 foot long alleyway.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-ali-mardan-khan,"The grand Tomb of Ali Mardan Khan has stood for centuries as a lovely funerary monument for the Mughal-era governor. While it was once surrounded by a lush garden, it now sites largely forgotten surrounded by industrial rail yards. Adding to the sense of melancholy, the side is only accessible via a macabre passageway lined by barbwire cutting across rail yards. Originally built around the 1650s, the tomb holds the remains of Ali Mardan Khan, a former governor in the region. Before being buried in his lovely, octagonal tomb, Khan governed the areas of Kashmir, Lahore and Kabul in the mid-1600s. The large brick tomb had actually been prepared for Khan’s mother, but when he died in 1657, and was buried adjacent to her inside, the tomb came to bear his name. At the time of its construction, it likely stood in the middle of a richly attended paradise garden, like many similar tombs. In its original form, the tomb was likely covered in colorful decoration, but time has taken its toll on the tomb, and the exterior is now a uniform brick color that belies its construction. Nonetheless, the iconic dome on top of the structure. and it’s decorative columns still stand. Even inside, the actual tomb, which lays below ground level, is often surrounded by offerings left by visitors. Local rumor has it that Khan was considered a holy man, and many refer to the tomb as his shrine. Today, the garden is long gone, and the site of the historic tomb is surrounded on all sides by railway yards. In order to keep people out of the yards, but still allow access to the tomb, an almost 1000 foot long passageway was created out of unbroken brick walls that enclose a narrow alleyway path. While it seems like a drab entrance to such a grand tomb, it manages to make actually arriving at the site all the more impressive.  This monument is located behind the fruit market at Shalimar Road near Gulabi Chowki in Mughalpura Lahore",tombs
66,Fairy Meadows,"Diamer District, Pakistan",A place as enchanting as the journey to reach it is harrowing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fairy-meadows,"Nestled in the Raikhot valley high in the Himalayas, it’s not hard to guess why this lush green mountain pasture at the foot of a majestic snowy peak was named Fairy Meadows. Known as “Joot” among locals, the place was given the name Märchenwiese (literally “Fairy Tale Meadows”) by German mountaineers who were no doubt astounded when they first glimpsed this idyllic landscape. At 3,300 meters (10,826 feet) above sea level, the wide grassy meadow surrounded by dense alpine forest is fed by waters from a glacier formed by the Nanga Parbat, the ninth-highest mountain in the world (and second-highest in Pakistan, after K2) that towers over Fairy Meadows from the south. A magical setting indeed — made all the more wondrous by the dangerous road one must take to get here. There is only one road to Fairy Meadows, and it isn’t your average tricky mountain road; in 2013, the World Health Organization ranked it as the second deadliest road on the planet. The windy narrow gravel mountain road is open to locals only (thanks to the high number of fatalities the way has claimed), who ferry visitors from Raikhot bridge to the village of Tato, one six-person Jeep-load at a time. If you make it through the ride without ending up a smoldering heap at the bottom of the ravine that stands in as the “shoulder” of the road, you still have a three- to four-hour hike from Tato before you can take in the hidden splendor of Fairy Meadows. But once you’re there, you’ll never want to leave! (Because you’ll be terrified to go back the way you came.) Visitors to Fairy Meadows can find accommodation in small on-site cabins or designated camp sites (the Pakistani government declared the location a National Park in 1995). The site serves as a launching point for mountain climbers summiting the northern face of the Nanga Parbat.",hidden mountains

In a world of commercial space flight and supersonic jet flight, it can be easy to forget just how hard it can be to traverse certain parts of this planet. But those living in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Northern Pakistan were cut off from the rest of Pakistan until 1978 due to the mountainous terrain and lack of roads. You could take a small airplane, but that was reserved for only the richest citizens. For everyone else, the only way to travel was by walking across mountain passes to Rawalpindi. In 1978, the Karakoram Highway was completed and the region was connected, but inter-region travel remains as difficult as it was 100 years ago. Regular aspects of travel through this region include the rickety cable and plank bridges that cross Northern Pakistan’s mountain streams and rivers. Among these is the Hussaini Hanging Bridge, crossing Borit Lake in the Upper Hunza. This rope bridge is both long and poorly maintained. Many planks are missing, and strong winds shake the bridge as you cross it.  As of now, there is only one suspension bridge connecting the Hussaini Village with Zarabad (located across the Hunza River) Despite its dangerous looks, however, the Hussaini is is a relatively safe bridge and has become one of the most sought-after tourist attractions, with hikers testing their nerves as they carefully work their way across.

With capacity for 100,000 worshippers on its grounds, it dwarfed the Taj Mahal, a structure that could fit inside the massive courtyard. Although the mosque seems like a tremendous religious structure, its history has almost seen more use as a military base. For the first 70 years after its construction in 1673, the mosque was known simply for its great size, and was visible from almost 10 miles away. The crown jewel of Lahore, the Badshahi Mosque was a symbol of power in the Mughal Empire. Cursed by its size and location, when the region was cast into civil war and overtaken by Sikhs, the mosque began a new history of exploitation for military purposes. At the turn of the century, Sikhs were in control of Lahore, and began using the mosque as a stable for horses and other military units. 50 years later during the Sikh Civil War, guns were mounted on the 170 foot high minarets to bombard a group that had taken refuge in the nearby Lahore Fort. Throughout British rule, the mosque continued to be used for military storage, and was in a bad state of preservation. After 1947, when Pakistan became an independent Muslim state, the mosque was returned to its original purpose, and extensive repairs were undertaken. Repairs have happened continuously through 2008, and the Badshahi Mosque is now almost restored to its original 17th century condition.",outsider architecture sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture

They weren’t historical landmarks for exploration – they were private property, and sometimes residences, populated by soldiers with a job to do. In the desert of Cholistan, the soldiers are long gone, but one of the most remarkable forts of the medieval world still exists as private property, owned by the royal Abassi family who also keep a necropolis for their family on the property. Derawar Fort is more than 1 kilometer in circumference and 30 meters high, featuring 40 stunning bastions rising out of the vast expanse of empty desert. Its ramparts are wide and smooth, creating an imposing structure unlikely to be breached by advancing forces and, more useful for modern times, an unique appearance more compelling than typical straight-walled castles. It’s very difficult to reach Derawar Fort in its remote location, and typically one needs to hire a special guide to take them on the full-day journey to the site of the fort.

The three valleys of the Kalash people—Bumburet, Rumbur, and Birir—form a cultural island where ancient traditions and pagan beliefs have managed to sustain themselves throughout time, in a land locally known as Kafiristan, the “Land of the Non-Believers”. The origins of the Kalash people remain mysterious, but it’s generally believed that the Kalash are descendants of Alexander the Great’s army, which seized the region in the third century BC; however, genetic research could not pinpoint their beginnings. The culture of the Kalash people is highly complex, comprised of a belief-system with a multitude of gods and is characterized by rigorous rules regarding taboos, religious ceremonies and animal sacrifices. One of the most unique features of the Kalash people is their relationship with periods. Women retreat into a wooden hut called a Bashali and they can not be touched by others during this time. Since the three valleys are extremely remote, they have more or less successfully resisted Islamization, unlike the Kalash in neighboring Afghanistan, who were forced to convert to Islam in 1893. Pakistan’s government often uses the colorfully dressed Kalash people to demonstrate the diversity of the country. However, today the Kalash people face enormous pressure from surrounding Islamic communities who are pushing toward Islamization of the valleys, one of the valleys already having a Muslim majority. That, coupled with the fact that the valleys are in a region where the Pakistani government has de-facto no control, makes the future of the ancient culture of the Kalashas unknown.",lost tribes cultures and civilizations rites and rituals

Brought to the attention of the outside world by way of tales from Indian and Greco-Roman literature, Taxila presents an explorable walk through the rise of human civilization in Southeast Asia, from Neolithic tombs all the way through to the footsteps of the Buddha himself. Located at the junction of ancient trade routes bestowing prosperity to the area, Taxila is a giant in terms of both size and scope of its archeological holdings. Three distinct masonry techniques divide the site into three separate “cities” hailing from three distinct time periods. In addition to its famed Buddhist stupas, some of which predate the tradition of physical representations of the Buddha, Taxila is considered by many to have the world’s first university, Takṣaśilā. Moreover, the ruins at Sarai Kala were home to Early Harappan remains dating back to as early as 2900 BCE. Though far less well-known than many other historic sites, few places on Earth have such a concentration of our historical record; so it was with little surprise that UNESCO Designated Taxila a World Heritage Site in 1980.  With this influx of preservation and curatorial-mindedness, a museum was created to provide an efficient guide to the three millennia of human civilization underfoot, making the city’s vast wonders accessible to all.",stupas unesco buddhism universities temples ancient archaeology ruins
73,Shangri-La Lake,Pakistan,The place that allegedly inspired James Hilton's depiction of Shangri-La.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shangri-la-lake,"Shangri-La is a fictional place described by author James Hilton in the 1933 novel “Lost Horizon.” It is described as a harmonious, peaceful, and isolated place, which was inspired by the mythical Buddhist kingdom of Shambhala. Given the description of Shangri-La (a Tibetan word for “Heaven on Earth,”) one might not immediately think of troubled Pakistan as the proposed location of earthly paradise. It is undisputed that Hilton visited the Northern valleys of Pakistan a couple of years before publishing his book. Nevertheless, the exact location remains unknown, and one can only speculate which place in the Greater Himalayan Region was the main inspiration for his depiction. In an attempt to fuel tourism to Pakistan, the Skardu Valley was promoted as the “true” locale that served as the inspirational source for Hilton. In 1983, the Shangri-La Resort (no relation to the chain of luxury hotels of the same name) was opened at the Lower Kachura Lake, which was then given the moniker Shangri-La Lake. As a result of the continued volatile political situation in Pakistan, the anticipated influx of tourists never came. Thus, today, the resort sits rather forlorn in the undoubtedly beautiful valley. The resort comprises of two buildings of mock-Chinese architecture, as well as an airplane, which once served as a restaurant (but is only sporadically open today). The airplane is a reference to Hilton’s depiction of a plane that crash-landed at Shangri-La – makes the unusual sight of Far East Asian architecture in Pakistan even stranger. Unsurprisingly, the Skardu Valley is not the only place in the greater region which claims to be the “real” Shangri-La. Most of these places are located in the People’s Republic of China. In 2001, Zhongdian County in Yunnan, was even officially renamed Shangri-La County. Additionally, historians regularly claim that certain places in Nepal, Bhutan and India might have been the true inspirational source for Hilton.

He also loved his cherished pet Mansraj (meaning “Light of the Mind”) who was an antelope. Something was bound to go wrong. And wrong something did indeed go, when Jahangir was hunting with friends on his game preserve near Sheikhupura when he espied an antelope that proved to be a tempting quarry. The whys and wherefores — errant shot? mistaken identity? logistical difficulties of cervine pet ownership? — have been lost to the mists of time, but what is certain is that poor Mansraj was cut down that day in 1606. Stricken by the loss, Jahangir paid tribute to the memory of his pet by constructing the 100-foot-tall Hiran Minar (meaning “Deer Tower”). The top of the tower includes a place to inter Mansraj’s remains, while the perimeter of the tower features holes that were most likely used to mount the heads of animal trophies taken by the emperor. An odd way to honor an animal friend killed in a hunting mishap? Sure, but grief does strange things to a man. In 1634, Jahangir’s successor Shah Jahan visited his father’s favorite hunting preserve and decided to add to the complex by constructing a large water tank and octagonal pavilion to the east of the memorial tower (for context, this was two years after Shah Jahan started building the Taj Mahal – guy liked to build). The rectangular water tank measures 750 feet by 895 feet and features a sophisticated series of channels and catchment basins to maintain the water level. Brick ramps in the middle of each side of the tank provide access to the water for animals living in the preserve. The octagonal pavilion, which served as a royal retreat, sits in the middle of the tank and is accessible via an arched stone bridge that leads directly from the pavilion to the tower. Despite being upstaged by these newer structures, the original tower still provides the name for the site as a whole, and Hiran Minar remains a testament to a heartwarming — if slightly eccentric — interspecial friendship.

Some monasteries and temples escaped the brunt of the attack, thanks to their relatively inaccessible locations. One of these was the Takht-i-Bahi monastery, an important Buddhist site even today. Takht, in Persian means throne, and bahi means spring, and this throne of springs is situated in the higher reaches of the Mardan province in Pakistan. Though it sustained some damage, it is among the most well preserved early Buddhist sites in the region. It was built as a small stone monastery in the 1st century, and one of the earliest inscriptions found refers to Gondophares, the Indo-Parthian king of the time. Under the patronage of the rulers of different dynasties who followed, more structures were added to the original premises. Over the next 800 years, it developed into a large Buddhist complex, one of the most influential in the region, and it was supported by the nearby fortified town of Sahr-i-Bahlol. The town’s residents regularly carried offerings and food for the monks who lived at Takht-i-Bahi. Despite surviving the invasions that wreaked havoc around it, the monastery saw a slow decline in the 7th century, when influence of Buddhism was on the wane, and donations to the monastery were dwindling. The monastery was abandoned by the monks, and it was only rediscovered in the second half of the 19th century. Excavations were carried out from 1907 and hundreds of statues and sculptures were unearthed. The complex today comprises of the main court of stupas, cells where the monks meditated, meeting halls, and covered passages.

It’s the third-largest ship breaking yard in the world, and it’s not a joke to say that this beach is where ships go to die. Gutted and disassembled shells of boats large and small are scattered up and down this otherwise idyllic beach. Dragged ashore and harvested for scrap metal and equipment, many of these ships are just skeletons as they wait any number of months to reach complete disassembly, their rusted hulls listing and breaking apart, half-submerged in the water. This is a graveyard unlike any other, where the bodies of ships lie silent, enticing curious explorers, history buffs and especially the mechanically inclined to take a look at the now mostly useless fleet of ghost ships. Parts of these ships will live on for years, of course, as part of the mechanical or electrical assemblies of newer, faster ships. Others are melted down and formed into new shapes entirely.

The impenetrable wall snaking up and down along several hills is one of the most recognized travel images recorded - Ranikot Fort is Pakistan’s answer to its much better known Chinese counterpart. At first glance, the similarities of both walls are striking, and it seems that the only difference between the walls are the hills in Pakistan bare no vegetation, unlike the green hills the Great Wall of China is known for. But the Great Wall of Sindh is not a protection barrier like the Great Wall of China. Rather, the walls form the outer defense system of the fort of Ranikot. Within the outer walls there are three inner forts named Miri Kot, Sher Garh and Mohan Kot – and together they constitute what is generally regarded as the largest fort anywhere in the world. The dimensions of the fort are truly impressive – its outer walls measuring more than 35 kilometers in length, and in total the huge fort occupies an area of more than 65 square kilometers, larger than some modern micro states. The fort seems to be contradictory in itself, since this colossus of it was build in the middle of nowhere, and being far away from any significant settlement, it didn’t seem to have a purpose in protecting anything at all. Since little research has taken place at the fort, the current state of knowledge is rather disappointing. Nobody knows who built the fort, or for what purpose it was built. Even the age of the fort remains dubious: while some consider the fort to have been built in the early 20th century, some argue that it might date back to the 9th century. Ranikot Fort is not only neglected by scientists. Until recently the Pakistani government has made no move in promoting Ranikot Fort as a tourist attraction. Thus, visitors to the enormous fort might have the place entirely for themselves. Ranikot Fort, Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan",cultures and civilizations ruins architectural oddities architecture
79,Thalpan Petroglyphs,"Chilās, Pakistan",Thousands of ancient rock carvings are scattered just off the highway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thalpan-petroglyphs,"If you’re traveling to the tourist areas of Northern Pakistan by road from Islamabad, chances are you’ll pass by the town of Chilās. Just outside the town, right on the side of the highway, there is a vast gallery of ancient art that includes engravings of Ibex, stupas, meditating Buddhas, and religious motifs and inscriptions in various languages. This route along the Indus River was part of the Silk Road for thousands of years. It was used by merchant caravans, military expeditions, and explorers who all left their marks on these rocks. Over thousands of years, religions, ideas, knowledge, and cultural exchanges spread along this “highway,” and based on the rock carvings, this area must have been a popular place to stop and rest. You can see many of the stone carvings from the road, but as you walk into the mountains, if you look hard, you’ll keep finding more and more. There are hundreds, if not thousands of these petroglyphs in this area, and the earliest ones date back to 600 BC, making some of them nearly 2,700 years old. You would think that this would be an enormous tourist attraction and that the area would be locally and internationally protected, but there is no formal protection. Some of the rocks have recent graffiti painted on them, but this did not seem like a malicious effort to destroy priceless relics, as locally, the artwork is thought of as slightly older graffiti and nothing special. There are few tourists in this area, so you will likely be able to wander among the rocks and discover the images all on your own.",petroglyphs graffiti rocks roadside attractions ancient geology

Employing modern architecture, higher-level geometry and a reference to the holiest site in Mecca, the Faisal Mosque is a unique confluence of Islamic inspiration across generations. Construction began on the mosque in 1976, after the late King Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz put up $120 million of his Saudi fortune to have it built in Islamabad. Although it is the 4th largest mosque on earth and covers a whopping 54,000 square feet, the mosque’s design is truly the most intriguing. When first conceived, the mosque was met with great animosity from the traditional community. Without a typical dome, the mosque instead is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by four gigantic minarets. Stabbing 260 feet into the air, the minarets were designed in a perfect one-to-one ratio with the base, to create an invisible cube that alludes to the Kabaa. All totaled, the mosque and its courtyard can hold nearly 300,000 worshippers. Situated against the majestic Margalla Hills and dominating the landscape of Pakistan’s capital, the Faisal Mosque is a sight that cannot be missed on a visit to Pakistan.",outsider architecture sacred spaces
81,Baltit Fort,"Karimabad, Pakistan",Tibetan-influenced mountain fortress in Northern Pakistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baltit-fort,"In more simple times, an awesome house was really the only thing needed for both the defense and definition of one’s empire. That may seem like a quaint notion today, but the grand and enduring structures that resulted are anything but. In the Hunza Valley of northern Pakistan, perched high upon a hilltop overlooking the villages of the valley, Baltit Fort is the perfect example of this melding of defense and definition, and its notably Tibetan architecture makes it as curious as it is stunning. Still standing tall and imposing after more than 700 years, this 14th-century fortress is a reminder of the lay of the land in northern Pakistan, both literally and figuratively, centuries ago. In the literal sense, Baltit Fort provides a sweeping vista of the valley below, exemplifying its strategic importance for both defense and empire management. More figuratively, the fortress is a relic of the feudal Hunza state, one of several rival states in northern Pakistan at the time of its construction. Its imposing beauty was a largely symbolic message to surrounding states that the Hunza were an advanced, powerful and intelligent people. Its curious architectural roots demonstrate this symbolism to this day. As years wore on, the original structure of the fortress became more ornate as successive rulers added to and changed its appearance. In the 15th century, the Mir of Hunza at the time married a princess from Baltistan, a state closely related to Tibet, which essentially resulted in a merging of the two states culture. Architecture was no exception, and many Tibetan-style buildings appeared in Hunza valley, with a newly renovated Baltit Fort being the most prominent and enduring example. As the Hunza state advanced, moved and to some extent fell by the wayside along the march of time, the fortress fell into disrepair, teetering on the brink of ruin by the mid-20th century. At that point, the Royal Geographical Society of London and the UNESCO World Heritage foundation took notice, working with modern-day Hunza leaders to restore and preserve the fortress, turning it into a museum and cultural destination. This ensures that, for now, the beautiful and curious Baltit Fort won’t be lost to history.",ruins architectural oddities museums and collections architecture

The architectural icon is both simple and striking, and it’s no wonder it’s become a symbol of the city. The mausoleum holds the remains of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. Called Quaid-e-Azam (“Great Leader”), Jinnah was the country’s 1st Governor-General. From 1913 up until Pakistan was founded in 1947, Jinnah was the leader of the All-India Muslim League within the then-British India. After World War I, Jinnah and the Muslim League increasingly advocated for a separate Muslim State. And after World War II, the Muslim League won the vote to finally establish a new country. Sadly, Jinnah died of tuberculosis a short year after the country he fought so hard to create became independent. The mausoleum his remains now lie within was designed in the 1960s. The stoic white marble structure commands attention even from afar. Lines of bubbling fountains lead toward the building, which is a pleasingly simple and striking architectural beauty. The mausoleum also holds the tombs of his sister Fatima Jinnah, the Māder-e Millat (“Mother of the Nation”) and Liaquat Ali Khan, Pakistan’s first Prime Minister.",modernism mausoleums tombs burial places architecture
84,Darra Adam Khel,"Dara Adamkhel, Pakistan",A city entirely devoted to illegal gun production.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/darra-adam-khel,"The city of Darra Adam Khel is situated in Khyber Regency, south of the city of Peshawar and close to both the infamous Khyber Pass and the Afghan border. It’s generally regarded as the largest illegal gun market in the world. Seventy-five percent of the population are involved in the gun business, and gun shops seem to be the sole market keeping the city alive. Individual craftsmen produce replicas of nearly every gun on the market, from Nazi WWII pistols to modern anti-aircraft guns. Most of the shops are identical at street level and have a “shooting range“ on the roof of the building. The arms business of Darra Adam Khel came into being in 1897, and is mostly run by the local Afridi tribe. The skills used to produce these high-quality replicas are being handed from father to son, keeping the family business strong for generations. Locals take extreme pride in their gun crafting traditions. Guns from Darra Adam Khel are not only of importance to local Pakistanis, but they have also played a crucial role in the Afghans’ struggle against Soviet occupying forces. Today, a good part of the guns and ammunition used by the Taliban (in both Afghanistan and Pakistan) originate from Darra Adam Khel. Unsurprisingly, a city in which numerous rival clans and Taliban restock on ammunition and guns so close to the Afghan battlefields is not one visited by tourists. Located in a territory that the Pakistani government has no control over and where large parts of the population have strong anti-foreign sentiments, Darra Adam Khel can be rightfully regarded as one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Therefore, it’s anything but a tourist destination, despite its newfound popularity stemming from the release of the 2007 film “Son of a Lion” showcasing it. Local authorities in Peshawar actively discourage tourists from visiting. Some foreigners have managed to visit Darra Adam Khel in recently, but they have always been taken there by locals with connections in the region. The town isn’t quite as lawless as it once was, but it’s still not a good idea to try to visit on your own.

Today it has some 900 members focused on promoting democratic ideals, who gather at the clubhouse watering hole in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan for debate, discussion, and drinks. The KPC headquarters includes a press conference room, library, bar, and chess room, among other facilities. Up the stairs and through a spartan room is a space that is worth vying for an invitation to. The inside of a makeshift wood panel partition is festooned with whimsical doodles by Feica, celebrated political commentator and cartoonist for Dawn, the country’s largest selling English language daily. The fabric may be fraying on the well worn sofas in the library but this is a tight-knight community pulsating with ideas and intense discussion. Overheard snippets of conversation among the old journalist “comrades” include “it was there on the lawn that I was arrested during Zia’s rule,” “a leftist state would care for all equally but I see it as a mother that will pay more attention to the child that is downtrodden,” and “if our government were secular, religion would not be able to create divisions.” The Karachi Press Club has organized countless protests against the government and rallies demanding civil and human rights over the decades, making it a sometimes controversial group to belong to. There have been attacks on the journalists themselves, the building has been vandalized, and their website has been hacked. Throughout it all though, the members hold dear the club, and what it represents.

87,Asia's Largest Cross,"Karachi, Pakistan",The bulletproof cross stands at the only operational Christian cemetery in Pakistan's most populated city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/asias-largest-cross,"When Parvez Henry Gill woke up from a dream he claimed God appeared in, he realized it was his personal mission to “do something different” and help protect and inspire the Christians in Pakistan, a majority Muslim country. Gill then financed and oversaw the construction of a 140-foot-tall cross that towers above the entrance to Karachi’s only operational Christian cemetery. When it was finished, the behemoth monument was touted as the largest cross in Asia. Facing security concerns, Parvez did not tell even the workers the true nature of the project. They built a long squared column first, and added the outward arms of the cross toward the end of the project. When the true intent was discovered midway through construction, 20 workers quit the job. But not all of the workers stopped, making the final result a blend of Christian and Muslim efforts. Gill claims the cross is bulletproof and can withstand any damage religiously intolerant vandals may subject it to. As it’s made of steel, iron, and cement, it does seem likely the cross will be able to continue standing tall and won’t come down easy. The Gora Qabristan Cemetery (which roughly translated to “white man’s graveyard”), dates to the British colonial era. The cemetery itself is often vandalized and covered in garbage and is even home to an informal settlement situated on top of several dozens graves.",crosses christianity graveyards burial places religion cemeteries sacred spaces

Visitors to Liaquat Bagh, located on one of the main arteries in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, may find themselves unaware that they walk in the footprints of gruesome history. On October 16, 1951, Pakistan’s first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, was shot dead by an Afghan assailant during a public meeting of his political party here. The park was later renamed Liaquat Bagh (or Liaquat Park) in his memory. Decades later in 2007, the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, was murdered moments after addressing a political rally in the park on December 2007. She died from injuries sustained after the shooting and subsequent blast outside the venue that left 20 others dead. Both cases remain unsolved to this day and have fueled numerous conspiracy theories. In 2016, the park also hosted the funeral of convicted murderer Mumtaz Qadri, who shot governor Punjab Salman Taseer in 2011 over allegations of blasphemy. The funeral drew in thousands of religious fundamentalists who thronged the park to pay their last respects to an assassin. But a visit there today and you would never know anything happened, as no visible markers or memorials indicate its dark history. Liaquat Bagh remains a popular spot for the residents of Rawalpindi, serving as little more than an inviting park in a concrete jungle short on green space.

The Hinatuan Enchanted River in Mindanao, Philippines, is a flawless saltwater river that flows into the Pacific Ocean. It is around 80-feet deep, and just barely long enough to be considered a river, yet the flow attracts visitors from around the world who want to experience the beautiful waters that locals have long thought to be miraculous. Its moniker “Enchanted River” came from a poem by Modesto Farolan. In fact, no one is sure exactly where the saltwater emanates from, although the prevailing theory involves an underground cave system that spits the river out, free of any dirt or silt which would usually cloud such a stream. Whatever the explanation, the clean waters are a natural wonder unlike any other. Local legends tell all sorts of stories about the river. One of which states that fairies added some mesmerizing colors of sapphire and jade to the river. Another legend states that the river is home to a mysterious fish that is impossible to catch. In 2017, the local government prohibited swimming in the main pool for preservation and maintenance. At the same time, they designated a swimming area some  33 feet (10 meters) away from the pool. Travelers should keep in mind that the infrastructure by the river is close to zero, thus, there are no facilities to buy medicine or food.

They awarded a photo of the Asik-Asik waterfalls in the mountainous Alamada region, and in doing so, announced the existence of this natural wonder to the world. The picture went viral on social media, and Filipinos were stunned by this discovery. The beautiful falls had been unknown to the public for a remarkably long time; the residents of the nearby village of Sitio Dulao had only come across the site two years earlier, after a series of floods and forest fires destroyed a significant chunk of the forest that was hiding it. The newfound oasis was christened Asik-Asik, meaning “sprinkle-sprinkle” in the local Hiligaynon language, after the sprinkle of falling water on nearby rocks. Lush vegetation covers the entirety of the ravine, and adds mystery as to where the water is coming from. The most likely sources are thought to be springs deep within the mountain or an underground river. Getting to the falls is not as daunting as it used to be, after the government, sensing a wonderful tourism opportunity, developed the roads and site around it. But there are still descending and ascending treks on stairs that wind around the mountain side.

92,Hanging Coffins of Sagada,"Sagada, Philippines",Hundreds of wooden coffins dangle from cliffs and caves in the Philippines.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hanging-coffins-of-sagada,"The people of Sagada follow a unique burial ritual. The elderly carve their own coffins out of hollowed logs. If they are too weak or ill, their families prepare their coffins instead. The dead are placed inside their coffins (sometimes breaking their bones in the process of fitting them in), and the coffins are brought to a cave for burial. Instead of being placed into the ground, the coffins are hung either inside the caves or on the face of the cliffs, near the hanging coffins of their ancestors. The Sagada people have been practicing such burials for over 2,000 years, and some of the coffins are well over a century old. Eventually the coffins deteriorate and fall from their precarious positions. The reason the coffins were hung was due to the belief that the higher the dead were placed, the greater chance of their spirits reaching a higher nature in the afterlife. Many of the locations of the coffins are difficult to reach (and obviously should be left alone out of respect), but can be appreciated from afar. Do not touch or walk under the coffins. Bring binoculars or a telephoto camera to view these remarkable coffins from a respectful distance. From Manila, by bus or private car, travel north to Mountain Province. For commuters: you can find buses in Cubao headed directly to Sagada. The alternative is to hop on a bus headed to either Banaue or Baguio and then transfer to respective public rides bound to Sagada. During summer, it will take you about 12-13 hours to reach Sagada. During the rainy season, not only is travel time longer, but the roads also become very dangerous, and sometimes closed due to landslides.",funeral art rituals catacombs and crypts burial places caves cemeteries ecosystems

With 33 recorded eruptions, the Taal Volcano is the second most active volcano in the Philippines and a part of the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire,” a large swath of the Pacific known for its earthquakes and active volcanoes. Despite the active seismic activity, this place is rather popular with tourists. Once at the Taal Lake shore, travelers take a boat to reach the volcano island, where they either hike up the hill or ride a horse. But the Taal Volcano is more than that. The region has some strange geological features that attract visitors from around the world. The way the features are arranged is something like nesting dolls. On the Filipino island of Luzon is Lake Taal. Within that lake is a volcano, Taal Volcano. At the top of the volcano, a thousand feet above sea level, is a basin, known as a caldera, carved out of the mountain hundreds of thousands of years ago. The caldera itself is filled with water, creating a crater lake, the largest crater lake in the world. At the center of the crater lake is a tiny island, Vulcan Point, which is one of Taal Volcano’s cones. The title of “the largest third-order island” is a short form of the logic that it’s an island within a lake, within another island, within a lake, on an island, within an archipelago, within the Pacific. On January 12, 2020, the Taal Volcano erupted, resulting in the deaths of 39 people. The eruption has caused the crater lake to dry up and disappear.

Occasionally referred to as Luluyuan Lake by locals, its crystal blue waters hidden between majestic rocky formations aren’t big on actual barracudas and other wildlife. Instead, divers can experience a thermocline and halocline unlike anywhere else. Starting out on the surface of the lake, divers, swimmers, and scuba enthusiasts can expect temperatures around 82 degrees Fahrenheit. But as you descend into the depths of the lake, around 45 to 50 feet down, the temperature drastically changes to just over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (to put that in perspective, most people keep their hot tubs at 104 degrees, so it’s best to forego a wetsuit here). This strange increase in temperature is due to the fact that the lake contains both salt and freshwater. Divers can even see the thin, distinct boundary that separates the two bodies of water. The lake is also characterized by an impressive display of limestone formations that rise up on all sides and extend beneath the surface. Divers have described a sense of “weightlessness” while exploring the hot/cool depths, and the sensorial experience (which is largely devoid of flora and fauna) has also been likened to what it must feel like to walk on the moon. But the lake holds yet another surprise: just when the salt watery heat becomes a tad unbearable, the temperature changes back to cool again near the bottom. Another unique feature of the lake is the sand at the very bottom, which has been described as “jelly-like,” “silky,” “airy,” and “silty.” It’s apparently good for play, too. And although the barracudas aren’t really around anymore, if you’re lucky, you may still catch a glimpse of one.

The Tarsier Sanctuary is a large forest dedicated to the protection of tarsiers, small nocturnal primates with big, round eyes that feed primarily on insects. They usually cling to low branches or the trunks of slim trees. Prior to the development of the sanctuaries, many tarsiers were kept as pets by private individuals in environments not conducive to their lifestyle and survival. Tarsiers are delicate, emotionally sensitive creatures that get stressed easily (and they have been known to commit suicide via banging their heads against tree trunks), so visitors have to lower their voices and keep the noise level to a minimum. Visitors are allowed to take pictures (without the flash), but touching the tarsiers is an absolute taboo. The sanctuary is officially run by the Philippine Tarsier Foundation, an organization devoted to making sure that the dwindling and delicate population survives and thrives. The park also has a store where tourists can buy t-shirts, key chains, and hats to promote the protection and preservation of the tarsiers and their habitats. Unfortunately the situation in the Philippines is obscure when it comes to organizations claiming to be tarsiers’ conservation units.

The hills, which are almost all symmetrical, consist of grass-covered limestone and turn brown during the dry season. Despite the abundance of hills, it is unclear how they were formed. There are multiple geological explanations ranging from oceanic volcano activity to limestone weathering. A recent theory is that an ancient volcano self-destructed and chunks of it were dispersed over the region. Numerous legends and tales also exist to explain the Chocolate Hills. One is about a giant buffalo who came and wreaked havoc in the region, eating and destroying all the crops. As an act of vengeance, locals left out spoiled crops.

When it was at full working capacity, the massive facility had more than 300 hundred rooms spread out in little clusters that essentially formed their own village areas. The jewel of Puerto Azul, however, was the challenging and picturesque golf course, which had been designed by a legend in the sport, Gary Player. For a time it was surrounded by an air of exclusivity and opulence that was nearly unrivaled. Unfortunately, the changing tastes and trends of the rich and vacationing began to change as other resorts and golfing options opened up in the area, drawing away the customer base and making Puerto Azul seem more and more dated. The resort also ran into legal troubles, and eventually portions of the organization had to be shuttered. Although both the property’s owners and local government continually talked about revitalizing the sprawling property, nothing ever materialized. While everyone dithered, nature and time took their toll on the abandoned portions of the resort. Today Puerto Azul continues to operate, but large portions of it are abandoned and off limits to visitors. Rumors of an effort to bring the resort back to life still surface, but the many of the buildings have been irrevocably retaken by the tropical surrounds. Parts of the old resort now look like a modern version of some crumbling Indonesian temple; given enough time and neglect, they may come to mirror those stunningly overgrown ruins even more closely.  From Manila, take the Coastal Road Highway then take the Cavitex Road. Drive straight for a while going past Kawit and Naic. Make sure you stick to the parts of the resort that are sanctioned to visit, and do not trespass on the off-limits portions of the abandoned resort.",resorts hotels abandoned

Vulcan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sunken-cemetery,"There are no flowers or gravestones to mark the resting places of the lost citizens of Camiguin – only a giant cross rising up out of the water to mark where this place of rest once was. In the 1870s, a volcano near this place erupted and caused the cemetery along with the capital city surrounding it to sink below sea level. In order to commemorate this place of loss, a looming cross was built in remembrance. Visitors all over the Philippines and the world come to admire this man-made marvel filled with legend and enchantment. Some say a feeling of loneliness will hit you once you see this structure standing all alone in the middle of the sea. A place of reverence and reflection, the site is accessible by boat and visitors can stand on its small base while it remains above water.

101,Tinago Falls,"Iligan City, Philippines",Hidden deep within a Filipino jungle is an incredible waterfall that plunges into a dazzling blue-green pool.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tinago-falls,"Away from the more than 300,000 inhabitants of nearby Iligan City, Tinago Falls provides a serene getaway deep within the jungles of Mindanao. Tucked within a forest-fringed ravine, this mighty waterfall’s name fittingly means “one that is hidden.” Approximately 240 feet high, its colossal rock structures are dotted by thick masses of trees and natural foliage. Despite this towering scene, what lies at the bottom of the falls leaves visitors in even greater awe. Tinago’s basin features a stunning blue-green pool of water. The colorful sheen of the water is more than enough to inspire legends of supernatural guardians that protect this aquamarine refuge. In spite of its mystic undertones, Tinago has been developed by locals to carry adventurers toward the falls. By way of a small ferry ride on one of two makeshift bamboo rafts, you can experience one of the area’s main attractions: when directly underneath the plunging falls, you can feel the therapeutic beating of the water on your skin. More than a hundred feet deep, the basin is not only a site for those who want a peaceful sanctuary, but also those who crave adventure. Thrill-seekers and adrenaline junkies are often found climbing and jumping off of the high rock walls surrounding the basin.  Tinago is under the care of the Philippine Tourism Authority. As a result, a small fee of about 50₱ (around $1) is required. Be prepared to climb up and down the ravine's more than 500 individual stairs.

102,Corregidor Island,"Cavite City, Philippines",The ruins on a deserted tropical island in the Philippines bear the scars of WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/corregidor-island,"Located at the entrance to Manila Bay, “Isla ng Corregidor” was identified by the Spaniards as a strategic defense location when they arrived in the 16th century. They named it “Island of the Corrector,” since this was the place where all ships entering Manila would stop for inspection. Since then the fortress island has been the site of many battles, from the Spanish-American War to the period of American colonialism. The oldest landmark on the island is the lighthouse dated 1853, but much of this lush tropical island is dominated by ruins that reflect the intense fighting that took place in World War II. In addition to defense and battery buildings, there are shops, a movie theater, and a swimming pool, all from the soldiers stationed here many years ago. During the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, Corregidor was the temporary headquarters of the Philippine Government. American and Philippine troops fought desperately to defend the island using tunnels dug into the rock as storage for ammunition and hospitals, but without reinforcements the troops were beaten badly. Corregidor was surrendered to the Japanese by spring of 1942. In 1945 the tide of war turned against the Japanese. Enduring months of aerial and naval bombardment in the tunnels on the island, they surrendered to American and Philippine forces in February that year. Even on a bright, sunny day the place is heavy with memories of what happened here. The buildings and fortifications have been left untouched, which would give the impression that the fighting ended just yesterday if it weren’t for the greenery that has grown over in the decades since their abandonment. Tour guides on the island report they are still finding detritus from the battles of WWII. They occasionally come across objects in the jungle undergrowth dating back to even earlier, when Philippines and American families were stationed on the island at the turn of the 20th century. The expansive tunnels below ground are no doubt the eeriest part of the island. These dark corridors are allegedly haunted by Japanese soldiers who took their own lives before defeat, but whether or not you believe that legend, the tunnels are disturbing for the sheer amount of violence that occurred there. The island is now a designated national monument and war memorial. The ruins have been maintained in memory of the American, Philippine, and Japanese soldiers who fought and died here. As it is a designated national monument access to Corregidor is by guided tour only. Tours can be arranged through Sun Cruises which depart from the pier located next to harbor square adjacent to Manila Yacht club. Departures for Corregidor island are twice daily during the week and three times on weekends. The guides are knowledgeable and very friendly, many are ex–servicemen. There is also a small hotel on the island so it is also possible to stay overnight and take advantage of the after dark tours of the island.",war memorial fortresses forts war history world war ii islands abandoned military ruins
103,Puerto Princesa Subterranean River,"Puerto Princesa, Philippines",Five miles of underground river link lake to ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/puerto-princesa-subterranean-river,"In 1898, the American Zoologist Dean C. Worcester described mysteries and wonders of the Philippine Islands from his travels, including the tantalizing reference, “If accounts are to be believed, of a lake opening to the sea by a subterranean river.” This extraordinary river does indeed exist, snaking over five miles underground through limestone caves, linking lake to ocean in the Palawan province of the Philippines. One of the world’s longest underground waterways, the Cabayugan River passes though 15 miles of caves, studded with stalactites and stalagmites, the water rising and falling with the tides of the South China Sea at its end. The caves have been a National Park since 1971, made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999, and was named one of the “New Seven Wonders of Nature” in 2012.  The easiest for groups of people (e.g., families, friends) is to book the visit to the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River through a travel agency, whether in town or in Manila. However, it is also possible to do it yourself. There are public transport going to Sabang and back (though often it's full when going back to Puerto Princesa.

With their exact locations kept unpublicized by the government due to a a series of thefts in the 1900s, the mummies can be found only after a five hour car ride up the mountains to the villages of Kabayan, then another five hour hike up a dizzying escalation of stone steps. There the mummies stay in Timbac caves, still curled in their original coffins. Scientists believe these mummies were first created sometime by the Ibaloi tribe between 1200 and 1500 CE. Mummification began shortly before a person died, where they would ingest a very salty drink. After death, the body was washed and set over a fire in a seated position, thus drying the fluids. Tobacco smoke was blown into the mouth to dry the inside of the body and internal organs. Finally, herbs were rubbed on the body. It’s estimated that the entire process could take weeks, sometimes months, to finish. They were then buried in the caves. The practice died out in the 1500s when Spain colonized the Philippines. Today, the mummies are left in their natural caves with relatively little security and have been designated as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world. Officials know of between 50 and 80 other mummies, but they will not give their locations for fear of vandalism. Locals still pay respects to these exposed mummies with offerings such as gin and chicken dishes, ensuring the dead are well fed and are having a good time in the afterlife. A small museum in Kabayan also displays a few mummies.",skeletons mummies fires cultures and civilizations rites and rituals death burial places
105,Old Diplomat Hotel,"Baguio, Philippines",This eerie abandoned building with a dark history is said to be one of the most haunted places in the Philippines.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haunted-diplomat-hotel,"Though it was originally built as a retreat house for friars of the Dominican Order, much of this dilapidated building’s history has been anything but peaceful. The Dominican Hill Retreat House was built in 1913 atop a hill in the famed Philippine City of Pines. With the outbreak of World War II, it became a camp for refugees escaping the Japanese army, but was eventually invaded. The Japanese secret police, the Kempeitai, committed terrible acts of brutality, massacring, raping, and torturing many of the inhabitants, and even decapitating nuns and priests. In the 1970s, the wartorn building was converted to the sophisticated and beautiful Diplomat Hotel, but the hotel was shut down by the ’80s, and left abandoned. The deserted, deteriorating building became infamous for being one of the most haunted ruins in the country. Various folklore and ghost stories surround its gray and washed-out red walls. Many people saw headless apparitions at night, and reported hearing screams, cries, banging on doors, and other strange and desperate noises. Some believe the building is haunted by the restless spirits of its grim history. The supposedly haunted ruin attracted an influx of visitors, and the old hotel is now under rehabilitation by the national government as a Heritage and Nature Park. The hotel has two floors and an accessible roof deck with a panoramic view of the city, and its west wing has been cleaned and remodeled as an event space. It’s now a place to experience both beauty and eeriness in Baguio City’s cold climate.  It is advisable to take a cab to get to the infamous ruin. Cabs are easily accessible and abundant in Baguio city. There is a small cafeteria outside of the main building for anyone who gets hungry.

106,Atching Lillian Restaurant,"Mexico, Philippines","In her ancestral home, one chef preserves ancient Filipino recipes and serves up traditional, home-cooked food to history-loving foodies.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atching-lillian-restaurant,"Kapampangans are rightly proud of their cuisine. The province of Pampanga is often seen as the culinary heart of the Philippines, because it is where many modern Filipino favorites originate, including the ubiquitous sisig, a sizzling plate of grilled pork face. For Atching Lillian, however, the food of Pampanga is about more than just grilled pork faces, although she does that very well, too. For Lillian, what’s important is the story, what’s important is the heritage behind Kapampangan cuisine, because tradition can add as much flavor to a dish as the spices. That’s because Lillian is more than just a chef; she’s a historian, too, and she prides herself on collecting age-old Kapampangan recipes and preparing food in as traditional a manner as possible. Most of the time, she doesn’t even use scales, because she says that her ancestors would simply throw in the ingredients, and guess the measurements. Little has changed in over a century inside her ancestral home, which also doubles as her kitchen and restaurant, and strewn around the dining hall are cooking implements that have been used by generations of chefs in Pampanga. Lillian’s signature creations are San Nicolas cookies, a religious treat dedicated to Saint Nicholas, which can trace its origins back to the arrival of Catholicism in the Spanish colonial era. Many of the wooden molds that Lillian uses to shape her famed San Nicolas cookies are well over 100 years old, and she demonstrates to her guests in the dining area just how, exactly, she makes and bakes the cookies, using a 300-year-old recipe she unearthed from archival research. Guests can even try preparing these historic cookies themselves, while they await the rest of Lillian’s reborn dishes to be served. She calls these her “Heirloom Recipes,” and everything on the menu at Lillian’s kitchen has the full force of Kapampangan history behind it. She cooks a traditional take on adobo, which, according to the recipes she’s discovered, is white, not black, because there shouldn’t be any soy sauce in the mix. She cures tough Carabao meat into a sticky, sweet-and-sour take on the cured bacon classic tocino, and she prepares Mexican-inspired tamales, which were brought to Pampanga during Spanish rule. Dining at Lillian’s home-restaurant is about more than just eating breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Lillian’s reconstructed Heirloom Recipes are all about the history, and you’ll be taken on a culinary journey stretching back hundreds of years as you gorge on Pampanga’s most traditional eats.  You'll need a reservation to enjoy the historic culinary delights of Atching Lillian's Heirloom Recipes, and for a baking demonstration of the San Nicolas cookies or any other classic dishes, you'll need to be in a party of 10 or more.  For reservations, contact Lillian through Facebook or call 09157730788. In the Kapampangan language, the restaurant is called Kusinang Matua ng Atching Lillian, or the ""Old Kitchen of Atching Lillian.""",philippines historical recipes cookies catholic tradition colonialism
107,Japanese Tunnels of Baguio,"Baguio, Philippines",Some locals believe the fabled lost gold of General Yamashida is hiding somewhere beneath the city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/japanese-tunnels-of-baguio,"Every summer, throngs of tourists flock to the high altitudes and commonwealth-era landmarks of Baguio, a city built over the bones of a former R&R facility for American soldiers. But running underneath many of these frequented sites are a series of tunnels built during World War II by invading Japanese forces. While most of this underground network has already been mapped out, some locals believe that somewhere beneath the former mining city lies one last treasure trove waiting for discovery: the fabled lost gold of Japanese General Yamashita. When the Philippines became an American territory in 1898, American troops and bureaucrats stationed in and around Manila were eager for ways to escape the tropical heat. Baguio’s cool mountain air and moderate temperatures made it “the summer capital” of the Philippines. The heavy American presence made the city a target when the Japanese invaded the Philippines in 1941 during WWII. During the Japanese occupation, their army built a series of tunnels under Baguio to store military supplies. Today the mouth of one of those tunnels can be found in the Baguio Botanical Garden, a dark cavern beneath a cascade of ferns and foliage. The tunnels are pitch black and dank, forming an underground loop beneath the road above. For years, rumors circulated that Baguio’s tunnels hid Yamashita’s storied stolen treasure. Rumors like these have cropped up at sites across the Philippines, borne of the vast amount of wealth looted by the Japanese. In 1945, the city played host to the formal surrender of the Japanese Imperial Forces, marking the end of WWII. And it is perhaps this historical significance that has fueled the imagination of so many visitors searching for truth behind the myth. There is perhaps a “fiction masquerading as truth” moment in the novel Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson.  The book concludes with an expedition into the mountains of the Philippines to hunt for a massive stash of gold. The above coordinates and address are for the Baguio Botanical Garden, where you can enter and explore one of the tunnels.",treasure gold subterranean tunnels mystery hidden military history subterranean sites war history world war ii military
108,Ursula Island,"Puerto Princesa, Philippines",This tiny island protects a number of rare bird species by only allowing visitors to set foot on the beach.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ursula-island,"A bird sanctuary with pristine white sand and not a beach resort in sight, Ursula Island is a small island located offshore from the municipality of Bataraza, in the Philippines that invites you to its shores, but forbids you from going any further. Although the Philippines is known for more famous white sand beaches such as Boracay, El Nido, and Pagudpud, there are some white sand beaches like Ursula Island which had been left free from resorts in order to protect the rare birds (mainly varieties of pigeons) which live within the tiny thatch of marshy woods in the center of the island. In fact, visitors are only allowed to visit the area after securing permits from the Provincial Environment & Natural Resources Office (PENRO) of Palawan, and even then it is forbidden to leave the beach and enter the fiercely-protected wooded area. Although this may be for the best as there are reportedly a number of snakes within. This is not to say that there is nothing to do on the island. Various activities such as shell collecting, sand castle building, playing volleyball, as well as birdwatching can be done there. Also, the island is small enough for nature walks around the entire coastline. Sadly, despite efforts to forbid resort-driven overdevelopment that has plagued other white sand beaches in the Philippines, some trash from the mainland has begun washing up on some parts of the island, posing a health risk to birds and visitors alike. Hopefully, any visitors to the island will cart out any debris they find, thus keeping the birds’ home safe.  Ride a ship to Puerto Princesa. Upon arriving at Puerto Princesa, secure necessary permissions from the Provincial Environment Office. After securing permit, search for the bus terminal that goes to the town of Bataraza (""Rio Tuba""). Upon arrival at Rio Tuba proper, ask for a tricycle man to take you to the Coral Bay port. From there, hire a boat that will take you to Ursula Island.",animal islands sanctuaries beaches birds islands animals

While most beaches are formed through the movement of sediment influenced by the wind, waves and currents, Mabua Pebble Beach’s unique composition was most likely formed by very strong forward swashing waves that forced the pebble material to be driven onshore, and weaker return swashing waves that caused the material to be deposited. The countless number of smooth pebbles that make up Mabua Pebble Beach, each varying in different sizes and shapes (although the majority tend to be oval) also serve another, albeit different, purpose. Walking barefoot on the smooth stones, according to reflexologists, has a strong impact on the body, as the feet have reflex points that are connected to our internal organs, making this beach both stunning and therapeutic. Mabua Pebble Beach can be reached via a 30-minute drive from the city center. Get off at the Mt. Bagarabon Mountain Resort and make your way past their Hajahay Suites towards the pebble shore. There are the carved steps off the side of a small hill, climb the steps and on the other side of the hill is the pebble beach.

Over a thousand people were killed in the disaster, including hundreds who sought refuge in the stone church during the eruption, but were tragically engulfed by the fast-flowing volcanic matter. The belfry and parts of the facade are all that remained of the 16th-century Cagsawa church after the eruption, but the facade collapsed over time, leaving only the old bell tower standing today. It is now joined by a wooden cross that was placed where the church altar used to be. Today, the Cagsawa ruins are one of the most popular tourist attractions in Albay province, as they are set against the magnificent backdrop of their very maker, the Mayon Volcano. Equal parts historic and scenic, the site, now named Cagsawa Ruins Park, was even declared a national cultural treasure.

Although he was forced to include metal stops in the organ to retain its sound, every other piece was built entirely out of bamboo, creating a unique instrument. Cera was a Spanish priest, stationed in the Philippines, and began building the organ out of practical concerns. Bamboo was everywhere near Manilla, and classic organ materials were hard to come by. The result of his work and the environment, was an organ built in the Spanish style but with an Asian twist. Immediately after its construction, the church and organ were assailed by mother nature. Earthquakes and flooding struck regularly and Father Cera was forced to begin restoration on the organ shortly after he finished building it. After his death, the organ went into a serious period of decline, even becoming unplayable during the early 21st century and after World War II. Finally, in 1972 a move to restore the organ back to its original luster was undertaken by European contractors. Today, not only is the organ playable, but it is the centerpiece of a concert called the Bamboo Organ Festival. With its strange construction, the Bamboo Organ has become a legend for organists around the world, who travel across the world to stroke the bamboo keys.

When the cemetery was first founded, it was set about 1,600 feet (500 meters) from the shore, far away from the waves, but due to rising tides, the dearly departed now have beachfront real estate.

But this cemetery isn’t a scene of peaceful serenity, so much as bursting with life, the smells of cooking, and children running underfoot. That’s because the cemetery has been home to an ever increasing population of living residents for over 70 years. Currently home to a population of more than 10,000 Filipinos, in between the headstones and crypts one finds food carts, kids playing dice atop a 150 year old grave, and businesses run from inside a family mausoleum. Originally home to poor caretakers, who began living there year round, the population grew as poor people who could no longer afford their rent moved into their family crypts, often sharing space with the deceased remains of parents and grandparents. The cemetery has been home to poor Filipinos for long enough that there are 60-year-olds who were born, and have lived their entire lives, in the cemetery. The cemetery is a thriving hidden city, where the residents form a sort of symbiotic relationship with the dead. To make money, children carry coffins (also said to bring them good luck) for 50 cents, and collect scrap metal, while their parents work to clean the crypts of the wealthier areas, work security, or dig graves. They often run local businesses from within their mausoleums/crypts. Nonetheless, the cemetery is no easy place to live, lacking hot water, electricity, and any kind of functional sewage system. Recently, there have been complaints from both residents and visitors that a bad element has moved in, such as thieves and drug addicts who are robbing the graves. In 2007 the Mayor threatened to evict the entire neighborhood. One group that does regularly get evicted is the dead. If you aren’t wealthy enough to have your own space you are buried at the edge of the cemetery and dug up after five years and your bones are stacked in charnel houses.

The Tangbo River, which the falls are connected to, is rich in calcium. This gives the rock, and water, at Aguinid Falls a slightly green hue, and makes the water a bit warmer than at other falls. Which is good because a proper trip to Aguinid Falls means getting wet. To see the falls in its entirety, visitors will have to do some climbing and wading through the falls’ five levels, six if you count level zero. Plan accordingly and wear something to swim in and bring zip lock bags/waterproof cases for cameras, phones, etc. With its alien beauty, Aguinid stands out among the many waterfalls that attract visitors to the south of Cebu. Though it does not have the intimidating height like the more popular (and crowded) Kawasan Falls an hour away, its humble and hidden nature give it special charm. There’s an entrance fee of Php10 (less than $1) which goes towards maintaining the area. There are also guides available at the entrance. Important to note, the guides at Aguinid serve voluntarily, and are not paid a set fee, so tipping is the nice thing to do.

After the Spanish-American War, America needed to beef up their defenses around many of their newly acquired territories such as Manila Bay. To this end, it was decided that instead of stationing precious naval forces in the harbor, a permanent defense platform would be established on the tiny rock known as El Fraile Island. The island was leveled out and built back up almost from scratch with reinforced concrete, and cast in the basic shape of a massive battleship. To complete the look, two enormous gun batteries were installed on the island. There was even a wooden barracks built on the new island, but this was removed to give the swiveling guns a fuller range of motion. The faux-ship was highly defensible and struck an imposing silhouette to enemies. Unfortunately the base was taken by Japanese forces during World War II and was held until 1945 when American troops moved to retake Manila. After securing the troops outside the fort, the Americans simply poured oil and gasoline into the base and set it alight, obliterating the remaining enemy troops and starting a fire which burned inside the base for days. After retaking Manila, the war torn Fort Drum was simply abandoned, leaving the burnt out base and its towering guns to slowly rust away like an immovable ghost ship.",military history world war ii islands abandoned military

Its tale traces a long story of occupation, struggle, and survival—much like the tale of the country’s rise and wane under Imperial Spain. The coastal Ilocos Region of northwestern Philippines was home to the native Ilocano ethnic group and served as a trading port for the nearby Malaysian and Indonesian tribal peoples. Being over a thousand kilometers from the Visayan Islands, the first point of entry for the Spaniards in 1521, this northern region was a rather peculiar place for Spain to establish a stronghold. Yet after 333 years of Spanish rule over the archipelago, the cultural and religious traditions of Spain are still practiced in the region and many other parts of the Philippines today. Along with these intangible transformations are the indestructible structures that have withstood the test of time. Structures like the famed Sinking Bell Tower, the tallest historic building in Laoag City, the capital of Northern Ilocos. One of the first oddities a visitor may notice is the tower’s distance from the city’s main cathedral, St. William’s. Bell towers are commonly built “attached” to cathedrals or a few meters away, but for reasons unknown, St. William’s bell tower was built about 80 meters from its doors. The bell tower was presumably built after the 1707 earthquake. It has withstood several minor earthquakes since completion, thus earning membership to the “Earthquake Baroque” style label by architecture scholars, along with several churches across the Philippines and Guatemala. It was locally constructed by Ilocano artisans who used bricks joined by molasses and leaves from a local plant named sablot. With a foundation of 295 feet and a height of nearly 150 feet, it was a solid structure that towered over Ilocanos for centuries. Maybe not for too much longer. It is believed that the tower is sinking at a rate of an inch every year. There aren’t any conclusive scientific explanations for this, but one accepted theory is that the tower being built on sandy land and its heavy and massive structure is causing it to slowly bury itself into the ground. Stories from the past tell of people mounted on horses being able to pass through the tower’s gates. However, if you visit the bell tower today, you would realize you would have to almost crawl through its gates to enter the bell tower. (Unfortunately, the city council strictly prohibits unauthorized entry into its prized piece of history.) Today, the bell tower is also sinking in a figurative way. The booming city of Laoag continues to undergo tremendous structural changes. The cathedral itself was recently repainted beige and yellow (much to the locals’ dismay), but the old, gray sinking bell tower still stands, tarnished only by the passing of time. You can get to the Sinking Bell Tower easily from anywhere in the city by hailing a tricycle.",churches sacred spaces history
118,Clark Air Base Hospital,"Angeles, Philippines",The remains of an abandoned air force hospital located on a redeveloped Air Force base.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/clark-air-base-hospital,"Clark Air Base Hospital was used during WW2 and the Vietnam War. It now lays abandoned inside the Clark Freeport Zone. Due to the number of soldiers that died in this hospital, the locals believe that it is haunted.  The neglected infrastructure provides some unusual acoustics, which, added to the darkness of the inner rooms, can easily lead one to think of supernatural phenomena.  Different sections of the hospital exist. Some have been reclaimed by squatters, but the sections that have been most ravaged by time and weather can be explored easily.",hospitals abandoned
119,Mount Banahaw,"Quezon, Philippines",This volcano in the Philippines is believed to have miraculous healing powers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-banahaw,"Mount Banahaw, an old volcano, is considered a holy mountain; a keeper of secrets, stories, and cults. Filipinos make the journey to Banahaw’s slopes in an effort to restore their vitality and spiritual health. Belief in its powers draws pilgrims from all over the country year-round, culminating in huge gatherings and en masse rituals during Holy Week (Easter). Myths and stories of visions and miracles have sprung forth from Banahaw for many years, ever since a local man proclaimed to have heard “holy voices” that led him to numerous natural springs. It’s said that those who bathe in the water from the springs will have good fortune and, in some cases, the ability to see their future. The many caves that run deep into the rock are said to also hold their own kind of spiritual power. According to the lore, the Cave of Judgement is a spot to head to if you’ve lost count of your sins and need a guilt-inducing reminder of just how badly you’ve behaved in the past. It’s said that entering the cave will strike a scar for every sin you’ve committed, but if you manage to leave its murky depths unscathed, then you’re doing well and your sins are few. The Rizalista cult has long resided at the foot of Banahaw. They’re a peaceful group who hold folk Catholic beliefs regarding the national hero, Jose Rizal, who they revere as God. The Rizalista temples found in the villages around the mountain are colorful monuments to their beliefs and a physical reminder of the mountain’s spiritual power. Because Mount Banahaw is the tallest mountain in the region, it’s also quite popular with climbers. Those who visit the mountain to hike and climb are encouraged to respect the natural environment and not litter.",miracles cults volcanoes intriguing environs mountains caves religion ecosystems geology sacred spaces
120,Lion's Head,"Baguio, Philippines","Just off the road outside Baguio, a gigantic lion's head carved into a mountain greets those driving by.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lions-head,"Kennon Road serves as an important artery to Baguio City, sometimes called the summer capital of the Philippines with an elevation of 1,500 meters (4,921 feet). This mountainous region is punctuated by large boulders and when the road was first built, passersby observed a particular limestone that resembled the shape of a lion’s head. In the late 1960s, a local club decided to make that resemblance more literal. Members of the Lions Club of Baguio wanted the rock to become a landmark. They prepared the limestone, and sculptor Anselmo B. Day-ag carved into it a more realistic depiction of a lion’s head with a large mane and open mouth. Unveiled in 1972, the Lion’s Head measures 40 feet (12 meters) in height. It is painted in shades of gold, black, and brown—though at various points over the years it has been painted in other colors. Today Lion’s Head is a popular stop for those passing by the highway to Baguio or heading back to the lowland regions.  Located in Camp 6 near the Baguio–Tuba boundary,",mountains rocks roadside attractions monuments animals
