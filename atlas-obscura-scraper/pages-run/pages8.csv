0,Lake Retba,"Rufisque, Senegal",This deceptively salty lake looks like blushing pink lemonade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-retba,"Evoking visions of Candyland fantasies, the princess pink waters of Lake Retba are deceptively inviting. White beaches and sandy dunes call to tourists, film crews, and even play host to the finish line of the Dakar Rally. As tempting as it appears, despite its popularity, and the fact that you will often see people wading through the pink waves, Lake Retba is not the friendliest of waters, and that white sand is mostly salt. Also known as “Lac Rose,” this unique lake lies just north of the Cap Vert Peninsula of Senegal, northeast of Dakar. Its salt content rivals that of the Dead Sea, which makes for increased human buoyancy, as well as a busy salt industry. Salt collectors arrive daily at the lake, covered in shea butter to protect their skin from the harsh salinity, and spend seven hours a day collecting the precious mineral from the lakebed. It is estimated that about 1,000 people work around the lake on a daily basis, and harvest some 24,000 tons of salt each year. Extracted salt is mostly used for fish preservation. The water in Lake Retba constantly changes hues, but the most stunning pink shade appears during the dry season, roughly from November to June. During windy weather and during the short wet season from July to October, the lake’s color is not strikingly pink due to the rain, which dilutes the salinity. The salt-loving micro-organism Dunaliella salina, combined with high mineral concentration and the intensity of the summer sun, are the producers of the cotton candy-colored water. With the salt levels reaching up to 40%, the lake can sometimes take a more sinister shade, appearing blood red, a much less comforting place for your imagination to go when gazing out upon the surreal view.","The lake is 40 km north of Senegal's capital, Dakar. With a car, the ride will take you less than one hour."
1,House of Slaves,"Dakar, Senegal",Despite a fraught and controversial history this African island holds a powerful monument to the tragedy of the slave trade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-slaves,"The transatlantic slave trade is largely consigned to public consciousness and history textbooks, but there exists many places where the full force of humanity’s cruelty can still be heartbreakingly felt, even if the place didn’t see much slavery itself. The House of Slaves on Gorée Island, Senegal is just such a place. The island itself, resting off the coast of Dakar, the capital of Senegal emits a rather somber vibe, something that more resembles a graveyard than a tropical island. There seems to be a respectful understanding that underneath the gentle sound of the sea breeze lurks the pain and silent screams of its past. Acting as a stopover where enslaved African people would be processed and shipped away, the House of Slaves was a market where Africans would be shipped by middlemen from mainland West Africa, and then traders could visit, and purchase enslaved people before leading them through what is now called the Door of No Return, filling small boats before returning to their main vessel stationed just off the island. The island is believed to have processed hundreds, perhaps thousands of enslaved men, women, and children, with some estimates even suggesting millions. However, many scholars have called the veracity of the island’s legacy and its House of Slaves into question. Historians are yet to settle the numbers, but it has been argued by many that the site was a minor location in the slave trade, and some have even questioned whether it was a part of it at all. Regardless of the actual numbers, most agree that what matters is the island’s symbolism, and the House of Slaves is best considered a memorial as opposed to a historic site. The voyage of enslaved people from the west coast of Africa to the Americas was known as the Middle Passage. Enslaved people endured traumatic conditions on slavers’ ships, including cramped quarters, disease, meager rations, and physical and sexual assault. The House of Slaves itself is now a museum. An evocative structure complete with iron shackles and dingy cells where the slaves were said to have been crushed together in horrifying darkness, awaiting their inescapable fate. The historical controversy aside, the site’s power as a grim testament to one of our species’ darkest eras has garnered visits from such luminaries as Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama.",
2,The Great Green Wall of Africa,"Dakar, Senegal","Over 4,700 miles of trees being planted to hold back the desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-great-green-wall-of-africa-dakar-senegal,"The Great Wall of China was built over a millennium to ward off nomadic raiders. With Africa’s farmlands threatened by an enemy more pernicious than any Mongolian horde, Senegal is leading a 12-nation cooperative effort to erect a living defense system aptly named, the Great Green Wall of Africa. The Sahara is currently the second largest desert in size, only smaller than Antarctica. However, unlike its frozen relative, the Sahara is actually expanding. The United Nations estimates that, by 2025, two thirds of Africa’s arable land will be covered in Saharan sand, vastly expanding the current 9 million square kilometers. Even if these predictions prove aggressive, the effects of farmland destruction on a continent already hard-pressed for food would be devastating on any level. With this peril in sight, the leaders of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Djibouti have banded together on an unprecedented endeavor to stave off impending catastrophe. Once complete, Africa’s Green Wall will be a manmade forest of drought-resistant trees (principally acacia) stretching across the entire continent. Nine miles wide and 4,750 miles long, the vision for the project is as ambitious as it is necessary. Thus far, only 330 miles of greenery stand guard in Northern Senegal, costing the Sengalese government over $6 million since the start of digging in 2008. International organizations have pledged over $3 billion to the monumental defense system. Leaders point out that the Great Green Wall is about more than just protection from windblown sand. The project will bring thousands of jobs to impoverished communities, and has already transformed otherwise unusable land into gardens scattered with tree nurseries. The influx of tourists, scientists, and medical professionals has also brought attention and resources to a neglected region in which aid is scarce and doctors are not readily available for the needy populations.",
3,African Renaissance Monument,"Dakar, Senegal","This giant statue is the product of a mixture of corruption, Stalinist architecture, and North Korean manpower.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/african-renaissance-monument,"Dedicated in 2010 the massive African Renaissance Monument is a towering piece of brutal Stalinist machismo that is intended to celebrate the achievements of the African people but will likely be better remembered for the corruption and unpopular alliances that led to its construction. The monument, which sits atop a hill surrounded by trash heaps and unfinished homes, depicts a man, woman, and child who are ostensibly meant to be African yet look glaringly like chiseled Soviet caricatures. The statue would not be quite so alarming if it were not for its sheer size, topping out at over 160 feet of bronze nationalism or a little more than half the height of the Statue of Liberty. This makes it the tallest statue in Africa. The statue was the idea of then President of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade. Wade was an octogenarian whose presidential service was marred by allegations of widespread corruption and nepotism, accusations that were only strengthened by the construction of the African Renaissance Monument. Opponents of the statue noted that the endeavor cost the Senegalese government over $27 million despite a country-wide economic crisis. In addition to the exorbitant price tag, the statue received a great deal of criticism due to the fact that it used very few African people in its creation. Despite claims to the contrary, it seems that the piece was designed by a Romanian architect and subsequently built by a North Korean construction firm. The design itself has also come under fire for its startlingly sexist overtones given the ripped male figure seemingly rescuing a damsel whose single breast has been revealed in the swoon. However despite the myriad protests and complaints, the African Renaissance Monument was completed in 2010. The giant landmark is expected to bring a great deal of tourist revenue to the country, however in a fiercely contested move, Wade himself claims 35% of all such revenue citing intellectual property rights. It seems like the renaissance might have a bit farther to go.",
4,IFAN Museum of African Arts,"Dakar, Senegal",Dakar is home to one of the oldest African art institutions in West Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ifan-museum-of-african-arts,"Seminal artworks and artifacts from Mali, the Ivory Coast, Guinea Bissau, Burkina Faso, and beyond inhabit the l’Institut Fondamental d’Afrique Noire (IFAN Museum of African Arts) in the Senegalese capital. The museum’s noteworthy collection presents an important glimpse into West African history and the visual cultures that comprise this region. Ritual masks, instruments, clothing, and weapons occupy the IFAN Museum, one of the oldest and most prominent institutions dedicated to the research and exhibition of West African art and artifacts. Founded in 1936, the museum was formerly entitled Le Musée d’Art Africain de L’Institute Fondamental d’Afrique Noire Cheikh Anta Diop IFAN/CAD and then The Théodore Monod African Art Museum (named after the French naturalist Théodore Monod). Its establishment was notably supported by the first Senegalese president, Léopold Senghor, who served between 1960 and 1980. Today, the IFAN Museum also serves as the principal site of the Dakar Biennale (also referred to as Dak’Art and the Biennale de l’Art Africain Contemporain), a Dakar-based bi-annual exhibition of contemporary African art in operation since 1996.","The IFAN Museum of African Arts is open to the public from Tuesday through Sunday, 9 am until 5 pm."
5,Bantyii Dibiterie,"Dakar, Senegal",A smoky doorway in Dakar leads to one of the city’s great communal eating experiences.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bantyii-dakar,"In Sandaga Market, the bustling heart of downtown Dakar, smoke emanates from an unmarked doorway in a crumbling multistory building. Inside the dark and smoky interior is possibly the most interesting and least advertised restaurant in Dakar. This is Bantyii, one of the best-loved dibiteries in Dakar. Dibi is Dakar’s top street food: simply marinated chunks of meat, usually from sheep but also including chicken and beef, skewered and cooked up over charcoal on basic metal grills and served with baguettes, onions, and mustard. This preparation is popular across the region and many Dakar dibiteries are run by foreigners, especially from the Hausa community in Niger. In fact, Bantyii is not a single restaurant but really a collection of six or seven grills run by different dibi experts from Niger, Mali, Guinea, and Senegal. The customers are just as diverse, from working people getting their day’s main meal to wealthy residents enjoying an appetizer before a fancy dinner. Bantyii feels like a portal to the warm, tolerant heart of Dakar. Some people say this is the favorite dibiterie of Dakar’s musical legend, Youssou N’Dour; visit once, and you’ll understand why.","From the intersection of Avenue Place 52 and Avenue Jean Jaures, walk north up Ave. Jean Jaures past the large DISCOVER store and look for the smoky doorway on the right. Bantyi is open late, until at least 11pm. Small sheep skewers go for under 50 CFA (10 cents), while more complex offerings like peanut-coated skewers, liver pieces, and big chicken chunks cost more."
6,Fadiouth Shell Island,"Mbour, Senegal","An island made out of shells, including a cemetery.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/joal-fadiout,"Each step you take in Fadiouth is accompanied by a muted crunching of hundreds of clam shells. Streets are covered in layer after layer, and the entire island is built on millions of shells that have accumulated over generations. Shells are a part of everything in the town and are incorporated seamlessly into the architecture as well. While the streets paved in bivalves draw quite a crowd, the second shell island, connected to Fadiouth via stilted wooden bridge, is the true gem of the area. Known only for its cemetery, the second island is also completely made out of shells. Although its simple and barren landscape could easily be ignored, the island is in fact very special. 90% of people in Senegal adhere to Islam, yet this entire island attached to Fadiouth is dedicated to a cemetery of simple graves, marked by white Christian crosses. Also buried in shells, the cemetery is a strange monument to the minority religion of the nation, and has adapted to the island’s shell landscape to form a beautiful graveyard.",
7,Langue de Barbarie,"Ndieulé Mbam, Senegal",A tree seems to grow from the ocean floor on this strange strip of sand slowly being overtaken by the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/langue-de-barbarie,"A slim stretch of sand pokes just above the waters off Africa’s western coast. While looking at the landmass from the shore, you may see pelicans floating around a tree that looks like it’s growing from the ocean floor. It’s the remnants of a peninsula that once barred a river from meeting the sea. Stretching south from Saint-Louis, the Langue de Barbarie National Park is a narrow peninsula of sand that has historically been the nesting grounds for sea turtles and many species of migrating birds. Originally, the park sprawled uninterrupted from the edge of the city miles down to the mouth of the Senegal River, where it was marked by Fort Balacoss in Gandiol. In 2003, heavy rains in the region caused the Senegal River to rapidly rise, causing great concern about potential flooding in the historic city of Saint-Louis. Unknown people surreptitiously dug a 13-foot-wide canal into the peninsula the middle of the night in an attempt to lessen the flood waters encroaching upon city. But their attempt to stave off the flood went differently than planned as nature once again took control. The canal became a gateway for the water to begin invading the land. Within a month, the canal had stretched by thousands of feet and caused the former end of the river to fill with silt and finally close. Soon, the salinity of the river delta changed dramatically and the freshwater fish disappeared upriver. Many local fishermen were forced to change their livelihoods, causing some river fishermen to turn to the sea and even more to take their boats north to Spain and beyond. The breach continued to expand for miles, eventually letting the sea swallow several luxurious hotels. Much of the peninsula vanished beneath the water, essentially transforming the park into something better resembling a small island. Despite the changes to the region caused by the breach, the Langue de Barbarie still hosts many populations of migrating and local birds. Local communities are attempting to adjust to the challenges of being newly exposed to the direct force of the Atlantic ocean and the increasing salinity of their farmlands.",Private tours are often available from hotels in the Saint-Louis if you are not staying near the park itself. The Océan & Savane has opened a new location on the mainland.
8,Gorée Island,"Dakar, Senegal","This tiny, tranquil Senegalese island serves as a powerful symbol of the Atlantic slave trade.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goree-island,"Gorée is a peaceful island of about 45 acres with a permanent population of around 1,600 people. Pastel-colored houses sit along quiet cobbled streets, and there are no cars to shatter the calm. Historically, however, the island, with its deep harbor and defendable shores just off the coast of Senegal, has been fought over frequently by colonial powers, including the Portuguese, Dutch, British, and French. The island is perhaps best known for its role as a strategic trading post for the transatlantic slave trade. Its most famous building, the House of Slaves, was, by some accounts, the first stop for around 20 million African enslaved workers. And while the actual extent of Gorée’s involvement has been questioned by historians, it nonetheless serves as a symbol—a “memory island”—of the Atlantic slave trade. Though slavery existed in Africa before Europeans arrived, the demand for enslaved people in the European colonies of the Western Hemisphere greatly expanded the African slave trade beyond taking people captive in war. Central Africa lost as much as one-third of its population during the early years of colonial rule. Prime ministers, president, and popes have visited Gorée in recent years, including Pope John Paul II, Nelson Mandela, and Barack Obama. They, like the many tourists who make the pilgrimage to the island, toured Gorée’s various museums and the remains of colonial-era forts. And, of course, the House of Slaves, which sits at the heart of the experience. The former trading house serves as an emotional memorial to the brutality and suffering unleashed by the Atlantic slave trade. Reconstructed and opened as a museum in 1962, it displays the horrific treatment that enslaved people would have experienced in trading houses, where they were treated not as humans but as chattel. Tours take visitors through the Door of No Return. According to one of the museum’s main founders, the late Boubacar Joseph Ndiaye, as many as 15 million enslaved men and women passed through this door, never to see their continent again. Visitors also walk through the cramped basement cells, where guides point out shackles on the walls. Upstairs, the museum displays chains for the neck, ankles and feet; various tools used for punishments; and a 17-pound, cast-iron ball that was chained to any enslaved person suspected of daring an escape.","Gorée is located about 1.2 miles from the main harbor of Dakar. Ferries depart frequently between Dakar and the island, taking about 20 minutes. There is only one hotel on the island, so the majority of tourists visit as a day trip. You’ll need to pay a small tourist tax of CFA600 (about $1 US) when visiting the island, and the same for entering the House of Slaves."
9,Niokolo Koba Park,Senegal,This park was designated by UNESCO as an Endangered World Heritage site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/niokolo-koba-park,"For visitors traveling through Senegal and desire to catch a glimpse of wildlife in their natural environment, the National Park Niokolo Kobe located in the eastern section of the country is the ideal place to visit. The park was established as a reserve in 1925 and was declared a national park in 1954. The park runs along the upper region of the Gambia River and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in the 1980s. A wide range of different species and animals call this region home. It’s believed that some 60 species of fish and around 80 mammals live on the reserve. For more adventurous travelers, a small swinging boat on the river allows for a closer view of the hippos and crocodiles that swim in the water and sunbathe along the river rocks. The center of the park is set in a new, modern wooden structure by the river. It’s the perfect spot to watch the sunset.","If you are driving your own car, a ranger will stay with you from the entrance to the tourist center in the middle of the park. The road is unpaved and the trip takes a while. From the center, you can take part in tours to see the various animals, by jeep or boat."
10,Cap Manuel's Abandoned Bunker,"Dakar, Senegal",This abandoned bunker looks out over the Atlantic from its clifftop perch.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cap-manuels-abandoned-bunker,"First person account from Atlas Obscura user La Tortue Noire: “The man shakes his head and puts his arm in front of his eyes. The answer is clear, he doesn’t want me to take a close picture of him. I don’t know his name, we don’t understand each other. He seems to be living there, half fisherman maybe, half homeless. All his stuff is laying on the floor in colored plastic bags. Fish bake in the sun. The heat is so strong you can nearly touch it in the air. We are in an abandoned bunker built on top of a high cliff at Cap Manuel, south of Dakar, Senegal. The place is called “the cave” by locals (“la caverne”, in French). I found the bunker randomly, saw it in the distance. To go there you need to walk across bushes and take care not to slip on the red dust. The cliff being very close, I recommend paying attention to where you walk. Falling down here would be tragic, and the waves are so strong I guess no one but the hawks circling in the sky would ever know.” Dakar is built on a arrow of land, pointing West, and nowhere else on the African continent can you walk further into the Atlantic. My intention reaching Cap Manuel was to stare at the ocean, straight ahead, but to the South, not to the West and the Americas. Cap Manuel is a very particular place indeed as there is no land in front of you before you reach Antartica, 6,000 miles behind the horizon (9800 km). I wanted to take a look at this immensity. And when I got there, I saw the bunker. I first set foot on the roof. The view down the cliff is tremendous. The wind blows so hard I find it dangerous to stand on the ledge very long; there is no protection here. The waves rush onto the rocks, the noise is astounding. It seems that the roof is quite accurately facing South, it’s like a plane runway ready for take-off. I spent a few minutes there, staring at the horizon (and rehydrating after the walk in the sun), thrilled by the view and the remote place. Then I saw the stairs going down into the bunker. While I was inside, four or five young men stopped by, bringing the man in the bunker more plastic bags. No words were exchanged. They stared at me, surprised, but did not ask anything. I have no clue what this was all about. But I know that the man there lives in the sky. The platform in front of the bunker, where the sentinels probably stood, is now his own balcony on top of the cliff. Does he know, when he looks at the ocean every day, how far the next piece of land is?”","An easy walk from downtown Dakar. About 40 minutes from the Place de l’Independance (remember to bring water, there’s nothing there), down the Route de la Corniche. If you prefer, any cab will bring you there. Your goal is the Red Lighthouse of Cap Manuel (and not the White Lighthouse of Dakar). Then, just get closer to the sea and look for the bunker (and be careful not to slip)."
11,Mosque of the Divinity,"Dakar, Senegal",This unique religious structure is an architectural gem with arresting ocean views.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mosque-of-the-divinity,"It was 1973 when a holy man by the name of Mohamed Gorgui Seyni Guèye envisaged a grand mosque on the beach. He took his dream as a prophecy and a commandment from the Lord. The sacred site was indeed built on a beach in the ancient fishing village of Ouakam outside Dakar, completed in 1997. It’s known as the Mosque of the Divinity (Mosquée de la Divinité). Designed by the architect Cheikh Ngom, the Divinity Mosque is a sublime religious structure characterized by two towering minarets offering unparalleled views of the Atlantic Ocean. Since the mosque was unveiled, it’s become both an important Muslim pilgrimage site and a breathtaking point of interest for curious travelers. Visitors consider the mosque a must-see in the Senegalese capital of Dakar, not only for its sheer size and the panorama it offers, but as a unique architectural monument that melds elements of modernism with traditional Islamic design. From the top of the surrounding cliffs, the view looking out over the mosque backdropped by the ocean is picture-perfect.","The mosque is set next to the beach, off the main road. You can reach it from the road by walking down a long staircase or a cab can take you down. The mosque is also reachable by boat. The inside is not open to non-Muslim visitors, but the view of the picturesque exterior is worth seeing. The beach area also has great swimming, snorkeling, surfing, and the local fisherman sell fresh fish in the late afternoon."

It operated there for two decades before moving to Dakar, where the space remains dedicated to exhibitions and educational programs about female Senegalese life. Annette Mbaye d’Erneville, Adama Cissé Wellé, and Ousmane William Mbaye teamed up in partnership with the Consortium of Audiovisual Communications in Africa to create an institution that focuses on female history and culture in Senegal. Named after Henriette Bathily, the director of a ballet company and a supporter of female African artists, the Henriette Bathily Museum aims to direct increased attention to the important parts women play in Senegalese society, including their social roles in the community and their place in ritual and art depending upon ethnicity. Through exhibitions, research, the development of archives, and museum journals, the museum endeavors to attract national and international interest in Senegalese culture through a female lens.",The Henriette Bathily Museum is located on Dakar’s Place du Souvenir Africain et de la Diaspora.

Every step of the fishing process is handled in the traditional manner here, for example, the fishermen use pirogues, which are flat-bottom wooden boats small enough to easily take on land. Before exported to neighboring countries, the fish are dried on hundreds of wooden shelves in the pungent “fish drying zone” in the eastern part of the village. This zone covers acres of land. Like clockwork, the Joal-Fadiouth covered fish market is overwhelmingly crowded at five o’clock in the evening, when the fishermen get back from their pirogue adventures. Locals and tourists alike jockey for there share of the fresh catch. The market is on the right side of the village close to the beach, while the drying zone is to the east.

At the end of the 19th-century when the country was still a French colony, the governor decided that the old bridge composed of 40 floating pontoons needed to be replaced. The links of the new bridge were crafted by Gustav Eiffel and were originally designed to cross the Danube. In 1897, the bridge officially opened to the public. Composed of several iron arches, the bridge has a central mechanism that turns on a pillar to allow boat passage. The entire structure spans more than 1,000 feet (500 meters) and is UNESCO World Heritage-listed, along with the entire island of Saint-Louis. The bridge has been restored twice during its history due to the high salinity levels in the surrounding waters. It still requires constant maintenance to this day.",
15,Forgotten Cannons of Sine Saloum,"Mar Lodj, Senegal",This rusting artillery is a relic of Vichy France's influence in West Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cannons-sine-saloum,"At the beginning of the Second World War in Europe, between May and September 1940, the government of Vichy France took the decision to shelter the gold reserved in the vaults of the Banque de France—the French equivalent of Fort Knox—so that neither the Allied nor the French resistance led by General De Gaulle could take control of it. Indeed, such a treasure could have represented a huge strategic advantage in the midst of hostilities. Part of this gold (about 1,100 tons) ended up hidden in Kayès, an African city in present-day Mali, which was then a French colony. One of the access roads to Kayès is maritime: it is a delta of mangroves located on the Atlantic coast, called the Sine Saloum, which is part of present-day Senegal. Vichy France took the decision to fortify this access road and had cannons, bunkers and military camps set up all along the maritime canal, in order to be able to repel a possible Allied expedition. These guns are mostly located along Cap Marniane, to the southwest of the island of Mar Lodj, Senegal. You can still see some of these cannons today. Most were rendered inoperable (their barrels were punctured) and have rusted in place. No invasion ever happened, and it is said that these guns never fired.","The cannons are all along the canal in Cap Marniane, Senegal."

Today it’s home to the oldest restaurant in this Indian Ocean island chain. Marie Antoinette’s serves up Seychellois “creole” food, a fusion of Asian, African, and French flavors. Curry wafts on the island breeze. Lace tablecloths and bird of paradise flowers frame the open-air dining rooms. Marie Antoinette’s best dishes include sweet and sour tuna steak, tangy mango salad, light eggplant fritters, and grilled red snapper in a yellow curry sauce. Pulpy, tart passionfruit juice is an ideal drink. If you’re feeling adventurous, try the curried fruit bat. After your meal, don’t miss turtle-watching in the backyard run. Giant Aldabran tortoises are endemic to the Seychelles, and many locals keep them as pets. Marie Antoinette’s tortoises are survivors. In 2001, after days of heavy rain caused landslides, a one-ton concrete wall fell on them. They were at first assumed dead, but all 11 survived. Their tough shells protected them, although still-visible indentations show how they were nearly crushed. If it’s lunchtime, look out for Abraham. At 60 years old, this male tortoise still has a big appetite for the ladies. His favorite mating time, the restaurant says, is noon.",
17,Moyenne Island,"Moyenne Island, Seychelles",A newspaper editor turned this abandoned island into a tortoise nature preserve that's now the world's smallest national park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moyenne-island,"Many of us fantasize about what we would do with our own island. Brendon Grimshaw turned his fantasy into a wondrous reality—a flora and fauna preserve, primarily housing over 100 land tortoises, the only human inhabitant watching over a paradise of endangered beauty. Grimshaw, who died in 2012, bought the island for a meager £8,000 in 1962. An adventurer with a love of nature and travel, he had always wanted an island to call his own, and was very attracted to the beautiful spots in Seychelles, window shopping for years throughout the smattering of Indian Ocean islands. Then, he met Moyenne, with its measly four types of trees so overgrown you couldn’t even walk past the beach and brush so dense coconuts never managed to hit the ground. It was a hard, long road to paradise, but with help from a partner, Rene Antoine Lafortune, and a bevy of misadventures (Tropical storms! Sharks!) Grimshaw developed the wild island into a gorgeous preserve, where he then lived with his Testudine friends. Moyenne Island, once an unkempt brush pile, is now home to 16,000 plants and trees, mahogany, palm, mango, and pawpaw that he painstakingly transferred to attract the host of native birds that flocked from neighboring islands. Nature paths wind in and out of the plant life, leaving room for visitors to explore, and explore they may, as long as they remember that the tortoises have the right of way. A reptilian version of a crazy cat lady, Grimshaw transported and bred roughly 120 tortoises onto the island, and they roam freely, many of them likely to have been destroyed on the other islands by development and careless humans. While under Grimshaw’s care, they flourished. Even today, visitors are reminded of whose home they are actually guests in by a sign that reads, “Please Respect the Tortoises. They are probably older than you” Bringing the island to life was Grimshaw’s greatest accomplishment. His efforts paid off: the island was declared a national park. Grimshaw had been offered as much as $54 million for the property but stubbornly refused, convinced that any buyer would destroy his tortoise paradise and turn it into another big hotel resort. It is now safely regulated as the smallest national park in the world, and also holds the distinction of having more species per square foot than any other national park in existence. Grimshaw chronicled both his life as an adventuring editor and his transformation of Moyenne in the book Grain of Sand.",
18,Aldabra Atoll,Seychelles,Over two-thirds of the world's population of giant tortoises live among this coral formation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aldabra-atoll,"Comparable to the Galapagos Islands in terms of rare biodiversity, the Aldabra Atoll is a bastion for a number of exotic fauna, but mainly giant turtles. Aldabra, the second largest coral atoll in the world sits in the Indian Ocean, 265 miles from the nearest landmass, allowing the small island to remain virtually untouched throughout history. This isolation has, in turn, allowed a remarkable variety of species to call the coral formation and its central lagoon home. The most prevalent beast to be found on the island is the giant tortoise, of which there is thought to be a population of at least 100,000. With the global population of giant tortoises numbering only 150,000 in total, that is no small number of terrapins.

19,Abandoned Church,"Plaisance Ward, Seychelles","In the middle of a busy residential neighborhood, a small roofless church being reclaimed by nature.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-church-seychelles,"Churches of varying sizes can be seen throughout the islands of Seychelles. They are usually well looked after, often with small manicured gardens. It is, therefore, quite surprising to find an abandoned church in the outskirts of Victoria—even more so, considering that this church is nested in a populated area, next to a school, private houses, and a busy roundabout. The roots of Christianity in Seychelles can be traced back to 1756, when France claimed the islands. As Seychelles had no Indigenous population, when European settlers arrived aboard the ship Thélemaque in 1770, Captain Leblanc Lecore brought 15 French men, eight enslaved Africans, and five Indians to the island now known as Sainte Anne. After decades of French rule, Seychelles came under British rule in 1810. It was not until  1976 that Seychelles became an independent country. Christianity remains the most widespread religion in Seychelles, and Roman Catholicism represents the predominant form. Located in Roche Caïman on the island of Mahé, this structure is completely roofless and exposed to the elements. The vegetation is cut back from time to time, but it is clearly visible that medium-size tree trunks have grown through the windows. The vegetation has almost completely reclaimed the walls demarcating the apse and the three lancets. Some moss covers the ground, and weeds creep in between the cracks, but the slabs of rock used to tile the floor are still recognizable. There are neither fences nor custodians on site.

But when British General Charles “Chinese” Gordon declared the island of Praslin in the Seychelles to be the Garden of Eden in 1881, he meant it much more literally. Gordon drew maps showing how the Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia, could be said to conform to the geography of the Garden of Eden, as described in the Bible. Even more specifically, Gordon found a species of tree specific to the islands, which he believed to be the actual Tree of Knowledge: the now-endangered coco de mer, said to look like the tempting female form. It’s also the largest seed on the planet. Gordon, who was called “Chinese” for his achievements putting down the 1860s Taiping Rebellion, was a renowned British general and eccentric Christian evangelist. After he was killed in the battle of Khartoum, his brother published a biography of him which included his Garden of Eden theory. More recently, the island was in the news as the honeymoon location of Prince William and Kate Middleton. If you visit the island, be sure to check out Vallee de Mai nature preserve to see some of the few remaining coco de mer trees.",
21,Mission Ruins of Venn's Town,Seychelles,The remains of a 19th-century school and living quarters are perched atop a mountain surrounded by a thick tropical forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mission-ruins-of-venns-town,"Deep in the Morne Seychellois National Park, perched on a mountaintop are the ruins of a mission named after Henry Venn, an Anglican missionary. Venn’s Town was a mission set up in 1876, and it consisted of a boarding school, dormitories, a laundry building, kitchens, washrooms, and dwellings for laborers, teachers, and the school principal. In order to sustain its operations, the mission cultivated vanilla, coffee, and cocoa among other produce over a large swath of land (approximately 50 acres). In the late 1800s, Seychelles became a haven for liberated enslaved people. Although the Emancipation Act abolished slavery in the British-controlled Seychelles in 1835, slave-trading in the area persisted. To curb the practice, the Royal Navy patrolled the East African Coast, intercepted slave-trading ships, and brought those they rescued to Seychelles. There, the adults ended up working in the local plantations as low-paid laborers. Meanwhile, Venn’s Town mission took in their children and provided them with some basic education between 1876 and 1889. This was a crucial point in the history of Seychelles, as these families and their descendants would forever change the Creole Seychellois identity that survives to this day. Today, the foundations and walls of five buildings remain over an area of 540 square meters (5,800 square feet). “The Laundry” stands out from the other buildings due to the clear-cut knee-high walls outlining 19 tiny chambers with evidence of rudimentary plumbing.  Thick vegetation from the forest covering the steep slopes of the mountain encroaches on the ruins, and a modern viewpoint platform offers sweeping views of the forest sloping down toward the coastal areas. None other than Queen Elizabeth II drank tea on this very same platform in 1972. Many types of plants and animals can only be found here, as well, ranging from the very small Sooglosus frog species to the Seychelles scops owl (Otus insularis).","A sign points at a narrow, steep road that branches off San Saucis Road and reaches the ruins."

Built in 1909 in the Netherlands and originally named Zeemeeuw, this schooner changed owners, routes, and purpose several times before Captain Robertson Durup brought it to Seychelles, where it was used to carry labor, supplies, and produce from island to island. From its base there, Isle of Farquhar sailed all over the Indian Ocean, mooring at the Chagos Archipelago and Mauritius. Throughout its life, Isle of Farquhar faced rough seas and weather, and prevailed so much as that it was nicknamed “The Unsinkable.” This was due to particularly sturdy design and steelwork but it was a cyclone that eventually got the best of it.  Yet, true to its moniker, the vessel didn’t sink.  The strong winds broke the masts, but Isle of Farquhar withstood the shock. To these days, the broken masts rest along the hull.  Much of the steelwork is now rusting, and invading vegetation has made it an integral part of the inlet’s habitat.  There are plans to restore Isle of Farquhar in the near future.","It is possible to board the ship, but for now it is dangerous and ill-advised."

Along its path, the wide river hosts a cluster of islands. One of those is Tiwai Island, a 12-square kilometer piece of land in the southwestern region of Sierra Leone (about 30 kilometers from the Liberian border). In the Mende language, Tiwai means “big island”—appropriately, as it is one of the largest inland islands in Sierra Leone. In the late 1970s, Tiwai was recognized as a special biosphere for wildlife conservation. The island is a protected wildlife sanctuary with a lush rainforest and a rich biodiversity with a high concentration of endemic species—those found nowhere else in the world. Tiwai is home to some 9,000 plant species (20 percent of which are endemic), 785 bird species, 320 mammal species (with 11 different species of monkeys), 425 reptiles species, and 510 freshwater fish species (35 percent of which are endemic). Among mammals, the rare pygmgy hippopotamus is one of Tiwai’s most important animal representatives. These elusive, solitary animals are much smaller than other hippos—about half as tall and a quarter of the weight. They are more active at night, when they emerge to feed on swampy vegetation. Pygmy hippos are only found in the Gola Rainforest in Sierra Leone and in parts of Liberia. Management of Tiwai Island is handled by the Tiwai Island Administrative Committee,  the oldest community conservation program in Sierra Leone. The committee is made up of representatives from eight communities within the Koya and Barri Chiefdoms. These communities from the surrounding lands collaborate to protect the island and its resources in exchange for community development and livelihood assistance. Tiwai Island is a popular ecotourism destination as well as a research facility for visiting scientists.",Tiwai Island is reachable from Potoru village (the village people can provide the boat and the guides).

Located just outside Freetown, in the Western Area Peninsula National Park, Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary provides guided tour in a unique context, a forest enclosures, where is possible to see chimpanzees up close. The sanctuary was founded in 1995 by Bala and Sharmila Amarasekaran. Starting in the late 1980s, the husband-and-wife conservationist team had worked with primatologist Rosalind Alp to gather data on chimpanzees in the pet trade in Sierra Leone. Even after being rescued, many of the primates who had spent time as pets could not be returned to wild, which led to the idea for a chimpanzee sanctuary. When it first opened, there were five chimpanzees: Bruno, Julie, Charlie Boy, Philip, and Augustine. Since then, Tacugama has grown into a large and diverse organization. In addition to caring for nearly 100 chimpanzees on-site, the sanctuary is involved in community outreach, field research, and conservation education. Tacaguma even kept to work during Sierra Leone’s civil war, which ended in 2002. Tacaguma helps monitor the country’s chimpanzee population, and once hosted the only documented albino chimpanzee. The center also has several eco-lodges (without electricity) where visitors can spend the night.",
27,Bunce Island,"Kupr, Sierra Leone",Home of the ruins of a British slave castle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunce-island,"Twenty miles up the Sierra Leone River from Freetown is Bunce Island, the site of a former British slave trading castle. The castle operated from 1670 and 1808 and sent around 50,000 enslaved humans from the African Rice Coast to the Americas. Most of the slaves who went through Bunce Island were sent to South Carolina and Georgia, where knowledge of rice cultivation was in high demand. The island was also the site of an often forgotten battle during the American Revolutionary War when the (colonial-allied) French attacked and damaged the castle in 1779. The castle had been damaged or destroyed in a number of other previous attacks by the French and pirates (including one by Black Bart), but was rebuilt after each attack. After the British outlawed the slave trade in 1807, the castle was used briefly as a trading post, a plantation, and a sawmill before it was abandoned around 1840. One hundred seventy years later, vegetation overgrowth clings to the deteriorating ruins of the castle (parts of which still include a second-story level) and its fortress. Other remains include the island’s slave yards, watchtowers, prison, a factory house, dormitories, several 18th-century cannons, and a graveyard. In 1948, the island was officially protected by Sierra Leone, but historical preservation efforts have been delayed by civil war and other issues. In 2008, the World Monuments Fund declared the island one of the world’s “100 Most Endangered Sites,” but a recent joint U.S.-Sierra Leone five-year preservation effort looks hopeful and is in the process of preserving the site and erecting a museum on the island. The island has been called “the most important historic site in Africa for the United States,” and descendants of slaves increasingly make the pilgrimage to view the emotional and tragic site through which their enslaved ancestors were taken, held captive, and sold. Nowadays, the island is abandoned and is an endangered site.",

After the American Revolution, the British granted freedom to the enslaved people who had fought with the Crown during the war. Some so-called “Black Loyalists” were given land and supplies to resettle in British-controlled Nova Scotia, while others went to London and parts of the Caribbean. In 1787, some 4,000 formerly enslaved people were resettled in Sierra Leone—regardless of where they or their ancestors had originally come from. Five years later, another group emigrated from Nova Scotia to Sierra Leone. According to the story, when the first boat arrived, they walked up to a large tree just above the bay and held a Thanksgiving service there, praying and singing hymns. That tree still stands, now between the courthouse and the National Museum.

The railroad system operated until 1974, then shut down due to a combination of increased car traffic and country policy. Since that year, some of the locomotives were bought and shipped to Wales, the others were kept in the capital city of Freetown. They were stored in the former train workshop, with the intention to convert it into a museum. The collection survived despite years of neglected upkeep, and the workshop turning into a shelter during Sierra Leone’s civil war. From 1992 to 2002, some 50,000 people lost their lives and hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. Many of those displaced people found the former workshop complex and turned it into a temporary shelter. After the war’s end, the collection of railway engines was located and restoration work began. A team set about cleaning and repairing the engines as well as the workshop space. The museum officially opened in 2005, and has continued to grow since then. The museum shows maps of the railroads, their history, and photos of the stations.

34,The Milky Seas,Somalia,The world's largest bioluminescent area was undiscovered by science until 2005.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/milky-seas,"The world’s largest bioluminescent area, a patch of ocean roughly the size of Connecticut, went undiscovered by science until 2005. Known as the “milky sea,” it has long been a subject of folklore within the sailing world. It even showed up in Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: “It is called a milk sea” I explained. “A Large extent of white wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of Ambouna, and in these parts of the sea… the whiteness which surprises you is caused by the presence of myriads of infusoria, a sort of luminous little worm.” Despite these tales of a great glowing ocean, the scientific community largely ignored them, as it was thought that the concentration of bacteria necessary to create such a massive glowing area was impossible. Then a scientist named Steve Miller decided to double-check. Searching the internet for recorded accounts of the phenomenon he came across the logs of the S.S. Lima which recorded crossing the milky seas in 1995. While it was presumed that no area would be large enough, or have a sustained enough glow to be captured by satellite imagery, Miller, with the help of Steve Haddock, acquired archival data from the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program for the night that the Lima recorded the phenomenon. When they overlaid it with the coordinates recorded by the S.S. Lima, they suddenly saw it shining up at them: A huge bright area off the horn of Africa. Believed to be caused by the bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio harveyi, the glowing area measures over 15,400 square kilometers and was seen by satellite glowing for three nights in late January.

However, they remained relatively unknown to the rest of the world until 2002. That year, a team of French archaeologists conducted a survey and documented the various cave paintings across the site. They discovered that the amazingly well-preserved paintings displayed both humans and animals; mostly dogs, cows, giraffes, antelopes, monkeys and possibly hyenas. Some of the researchers belonging to the team believed the cows represented divinity, as many of the paintings displayed them wearing robes. Several scenes also depict what appears to be humans worshipping cow-like figures and a woman caring for a dog. There have been difficulties in dating the paintings, but they are believed to be between 5,000 to 11,000 years old. Laas Geel is located within the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, just a few kilometers from the Hargeisa-Berbera road.

Not only is the monument’s dais covered in colorful—and on closer inspection, quite brutal—murals, on its top sits a downed MiG-17 fighter jet. In the late 1980s, Somaliland began a concerted attempt to break away from Somalia and the brutal dictatorial rule of Somali president Siad Barre. In response, the Somali Air Force began a large-scale aerial bombardment of Hargeisa, a stronghold of the rebel Somali National Movement. The indiscriminate bombardment destroyed at least 70 percent of the city and, combined with summary executions and ground attacks, resulted in the death of around 50,000 people, mostly civilians. This is now known as the Isaaq Genocide, or Hargeisa Holocaust. Despite the terrible cost, Somaliland declared itself an independent state in 1991. This was not internationally recognized, but Somaliland experienced relative stability in the years that followed, especially in comparison to the ongoing civil war that continued to engulf Somalia. Today, many countries at least recognize Somaliland as an autonomous region of Somalia. To mark the brutal bombardment of Hargeisa, and to honor those who lost their lives, a monument was later erected in the city center, on what is now known as Freedom Square. The colorful monument consists of a large dais, on the top of which sits a fighter jet. This jet, a MiG-17, was one of the Somali Air Force aircraft that took off from Hargeisa airport before turning back around to repeatedly bomb the very same city. It crashed during the bombardment and was later recovered by the rebels. As you walk closer to the memorial, you’ll see that the colorful murals decorating each side of the dais are in fact very dark in the nature of what they depict. They show scenes of life from the civil war: men with severed arms and legs; human limbs scattered across a battlefield; houses burning as jets fly overhead; and the summary executions of civilians. But there are also symbols of hope. A woman stands defiant, holding up the flag of the Republic of Somaliland as she looks up at the sky. And on one side of the dais, the image of the scarred and body-strewn battlefield peels away at the corner, to reveal just a glimpse of an alternative image lying behind, one of green lands and blue skies not ravaged by war and destruction.

Here at the mouth of the Blyde River Canyon, the two rivers formed swirling eddies of water. Over time, this formed huge cylindrical potholes in the sandstone bedrock. The effect, seen from the crags above, is now a fascinating network of tunnels and tubes and interconnected whirling pools. The different soil levels in each hole give them each a unique color and makes for a striking and colorful landscape. The formations get their name from a prospector, John Bourke, who was one of the first to proclaim that the region had gold deposits and who staked a claim nearby. Despite the name of the potholes, he never found a single ounce of gold there — though luckier prospectors would later find rich amounts of gold in the area. Even if he walked away empty-handed, his name lives on in the stunning scenery.

40,Bo Kaap,"Cape Town, South Africa","Formerly known as the Malay Quarter, Bo Kaap is a colorfully-painted suburb located in the “Mother City” of South Africa.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bo-kaap,"In the 16th and 17th Centuries, the Dutch, who were occupying South Africa at the time, brought thousands of people (mainly Muslims) from Malaysia, Indonesia, and other African countries to the Cape of Good Hope as slaves. The descendants of these Muslim-majority slaves were segregated under the 1950 apartheid law into Bo Kaap, a neighborhood designated as “Cape Muslims only.” These Muslim communities, in part for the celebrations of Eid, painted their segregated neighborhood with a riot of bright colors, qualifying it as one of the most colorful parts of the world. From the center of Cape Town, it’s about a 10 minute walk to Bo Kaap, and you’ll know it when you arrive. One way cobbled streets weave through the vibrant one-story and two-story homes, stacked right next to each other with practically no open space between them. The colors directly overlap each other and strong lime green borders sky blue, light pink adjoins bright yellow, and pastel purple meets a full turquoise. Unfortunately the once segregated neighborhood is in danger of losing the Muslim community that made it so colorful. Since apartheid ended in 1994, allowing non-Muslims to live in Bo Kaap, the property taxes have gone up. Unable-to-pay Muslims were forced to move out, while white South Africans eager to live in such a richly-colored neighborhood moved in. (Apparently a handful of Cape Town’s non-Muslim women have also moved into Bo Kaap and converted to Islam in order to marry local Muslim men, citing their reasoning as, “they didn’t drink alcohol, so they made better husbands.”) Meanwhile, to counter this gentrification, activists living in Bo Kaap have emphasized cultural preservation and have been able to keep the percentage of outsiders owning Bo Kaap property at 15%, although this number is rising. Bo Kaap is one of the most brilliantly-colored and  historically-unique neighborhoods in all of South Africa. Hopefully it manages to hold onto its colorful cultural history and not just the paint job.",
41,Adam's Calendar,"Ehlanzeni, South Africa","Hidden in the hills is a mysterious stone structure, known only to a few.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adams-calendar,"In 2003, South African pilot Johan Heine was flying over the hills of the gorgeous Mpumalanga region of South Africa when he crashed his plane into the mountainside. After exiting the plane, Heine saw before him three monolithic, five-ton dolomite stones sticking out of the ground, and behind them a giant stone circle. Known to only a select few and accessible solely by rough dirt roads past the wild horses of Kaapschehoop, the megalithic stone calendar is dubbed Adam’s Calendar. With the shape of a circle and a diameter of 100 feet, it is nicknamed the “Birthplace of the Sun” and dubbed “Africa’s Stonehenge.” As with many similar stone monuments, it loosely aligns with the celestial world. The stone circle generated a fair amount of buzz after Michael Tellinger, a writer, claimed it is the oldest manmade structure in the world and was made by a vanished civilization. However, his claims have been widely disputed. As of now, the true age, origin, and purpose of Adam’s Calendar remains a mystery that is yet to be solved.",
42,South African Astronomical Observatory,"Cape Town, South Africa",This historic observatory was established to keep shipwrecks from littering the Cape of Good Hope.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/south-african-astronomical-observatory,"In South Africa, the Cape of Good Hope is the official home of the South African Astronomical Observatory on top, and the unofficial home of more than 3,500 shipwrecks down at the bottom. Until the work of the South African Astronomical Observatory (the SAAO) began in 1820, the treacherous seas around the Cape of Good Hope saw more than 500 years of ships battering and crashing through the South Atlantic, with little to no usable stellar navigation established. Without the positions of the Southern stars accurately mapped, ships were often on their own, in unfamiliar waters and under unfamiliar skies. In 1820, a young Fearon Fallows was sent by the Royal Society of Astronomers to the Cape of Good Hope to get a handle on those southern skies, and maybe help a few ships’ captains avoid disaster. Fallows, a brilliant astronomer and mathematician, was from the same small town of Cockermouth in the north of England that produced the brilliant poet William Wordsworth and less brilliant (but maybe more colorful) Fletcher Christian of Mutiny on the Bounty fame. Despite his small-town beginnings, Fallows was talented enough to be dispatched to the other side of the world to accomplish a nearly impossible task – to get an observatory up and running while plagued by sand and dust storms, snakes, a lack of qualified stone masons (major stone work was required to stabilize early astronomical equipment), and the dreaded tablecloth clouds that could almost instantly block out the skies. But Fallows persevered, and the original structure for the observatory was completed in 1829. Sadly, the struggle may have taken the ultimate toll on Fallows, who passed away only three years later – dead from recurring scarlet fever, and buried on the grounds of his now-functioning observatory. Fallows’ plotting of the southern skies finally appeared in star catalogs in 1851, and his successor’s catalogue of Southern stars has held as a basis of refined sidereal astronomy (a field that relates to constellations and their daily movements) in the southern hemisphere. The observatory’s measurements were so precise for their time – this is still only 1833 – that they accurately measured the distance of Alpha Centauri (our next closest star, almost four and a half lightyears away) to within 1/5,000th of a degree. As the SAAO notes, that’s like measuring the diameter of a penny from two and a half miles away. The observatory eventually set up a campus of major telescopes in Sutherland, about four hours away from the main location in Observatory, in order to take advantage of its dark skies, with very little light pollution and mostly unfettered by clouds. There they’ve erected the largest telescope in the southern hemisphere, the aptly named Southern African Large Telescope, or SALT, which houses 91, three-foot mirrors to create a light-gathering surface of 835 square feet. That’s just one of their telescopes, but that’s a lot of light.",Cape Town main campus is in the suburb of Observatory off Liesbeek Pkwy. The Sutherland telescope facilities

It’s the largest shop selling rare and used books in Africa, and potentially the entire Southern Hemisphere. Visitors to Collectors Treasury will find themselves stumbling into a plethora of second-hand books as soon as they enter the door. The books are packed into every corner and wedged atop any surface that will support them. They line the walls, are stacked into towering piles, and even occupy a bit of space in the elevator. Take some time browsing through the seemingly endless maze of literary delights to unearth some real treasures! Keep your eyes peeled while scanning the floor-to-ceiling shelves to spot some rare finds from around the world, such as first-edition prints and books that are no longer even published. Collectors Treasury also has maps, prints, engravings, newspapers, photographs, and thousands of vinyl records and 78 rpm discs, as well as a small selection of decorative art antiquities. It’s a mystery to most how the store keeps track of its enormous collection, and yet brothers Jonathan and Geoffrey Klass have managed to keep the family business growing. They founded the store in 1974 in a shop above a garage, and have obviously had to relocate to a space large enough to hold their massive stock.",

The piles of seals use the island as their main breeding ground and usually are left in peace. Humans have tried to inhabit the island, but failed, once as sealers in the early 20th century and later during World War II with an installation of a radar that was soon destroyed by the elements. However, the Great White Sharks also love the little island and at certain times of the year create a circle around it known as the Ring of Death. Any seal that swims too far is attacked by the sharks that actually leap from the water with the seals in their teeth before crashing down into the waves.",
45,Sudwala Caves,South Africa,These otherworldly caverns form Earth's oldest known cave system.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sudwala-caves,"The Sudwala Caves in Mpumalanga, South Africa, are the oldest known caves in the world. They began to form about 240 million years ago as natural acid in groundwater seeped through the faults and joints of the region’s Precambrian dolomite rock. To put that unimaginable length of time into some context, when the cave formation began, Africa was still a part of Gondwana, the supercontinent that incorporated present-day South America, Africa, Arabia, Madagascar, India, Australia, and Antarctica. The caves are part of the Malmani Dolomite Ridge. Near the entrance to the system is a massive chamber measuring 230 feet (70 meters) in diameter and 121 feet (37 meters) high from the center of the chamber to its dome-like ceiling. The chamber is known as the PR Owen Hall, after Philippus Rudolf Owen. In 1965, Owen purchased the land on which the caves are found and opened them up to the public. Many other named features exist within the spectacular cave system, which stretches for many miles. There are strange speleothem structures—stalagmites, stalactites, and flowstones —with names like Samson’s Pillar, the Rocket, and the Screaming Monster. These began to form between 140 and 200 million years ago; the growth rate for a stalactite in the Sudwala Caves is about one inch (2.5 centimeters) per century. Other nooks and bizarre outcroppings bear titles such as the Devil’s Workshop and Fairyland, while a natural pattern on the ceiling of one chamber is known as the Map of Africa. Apart from primitive microbial fossils and a colony of about 800 horseshoe bats, signs of life inside the Sudwala Caves are scarce. Humans, however, have made their mark. Homo habilis, one of the earliest members of the genus Homo, lived in the caves around 1.8 million years ago, and some of their primitive stone tools have been found inside, along with archaeological finds dating to a few thousand years B.C. (some of these artifacts are displayed near the cave entrance). Far more recently, the caves served as a fortress and refuge for the Swazi prince Somquba. In the mid-1800s, Somquba was locked in a power struggle with his brother and heir apparent, Mswati. During the conflict, Somquba used the caves as a refuge with its own source of fresh water and plenty of room to stockpile food and house cattle. It was also a natural fortress, with a narrow entrance that could be easily watched and defended. Many battles took place at the entrance, which was under the charge of Sudwala, Somquba’s captain, after whom the caves were named. On various occasions, Mswati’s forces tried to smoke Sudwala and his men out of the cave, or suffocate them inside it, by starting fires at the entrance (burn marks can still be seen today). But due to a natural flow of air which exists inside the cave—the source of which is still unknown—Somquba and Sudwala were able to survive. The caves were later used by the Boers to store ammunition during the Second Boer War, which lasted from 1899 to 1902. At the end of the war, rumors began to circulate that President Paul Kruger had hidden a hoard of gold in the caves to protect it from the British. Known as the “Kruger Millions,” the treasure trove of gold coins is estimated to be worth around U.S. $500,000,000 in today’s terms. It still hasn’t been found. Since the 1970s, the main chamber of the Sudwala Caves has also been used as a concert hall. Capable of seating 500 people, it apparently has fantastic acoustics and a pleasant temperature, the latter thanks to the same flow of fresh air, the origin of which is still unknown, that saved Somquba.","The Sudwala Caves are located about 17 miles west of Mbombela (previously called Nelspruit) in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa. To get to the caves, turn off the N4 onto the R539 and continue for about six miles until you see a sign for Sudwala. Take the turning and follow the signs for just over a mile until you reach the caves. The caves are open every day of the year from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The standard entrance fee for adults is R100 (about $7.15 US). Or you can pay R450 ($32) for the Crystal Tour, which takes you about 1.25 miles into the caves to the “Crystal Chamber,” which is full of sparkling aragonite crystals."

48,Tapi Tapi Ice Cream,"Cape Town, South Africa",The frozen treats at this Cape Town parlor are inspired by Africa's food cultures.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tapi-tapi-ice-cream,"Even in South Africa, African food is not the default. And in Cape Town especially, dining can be quite Eurocentric. Centuries of colonialism erased indigenous foods and entrenched the idea that European food is somehow superior. These effects are still found today, but a microbiologist turned ice-cream maker, Tapiwa Guzha, wants that to change. With every handcrafted scoop served at Cape Town’s Tapi Tapi, he tells the story of his own food history, as well as stories from across the African continent. His freezers contain flavors like rondo ice cream, made with a nutritious edible clay consumed by pregnant women all over Africa, as well as botanical flavors such as black-jack, bitter leaf, and baobab. Sometimes Guzha whips up an ice-cream version of kelewele, a caramelized Ghanaian plantain snack with ginger and fire-roasted peanuts. Guzha’s recipes range from comforting to challenging. One of his more daring ice-cream flavors included matemba, a dried fish that he paired with toffee. Tapi Tapi is located in the heart of Observatory, an eclectic and diverse neighborhood in Cape Town. Guzha has painted his open-air parlor with his own artwork and words. As a one-man business, his operation is truly remarkable, open six days a week and closed for churning ice cream on the seventh. But Guzha’s passion for his creations and his mission keep him going.","Tapi Tapi  is also the home of “Iwe neni,” Guzha's food accessibility project where he makes nutritious meals for hungry locals. You can donate money or produce to Guzha’s feeding scheme, or pay it forward by donating ice cream to someone else. This allows Guzha to offer ice cream for free to someone who would like to try it but has financial limitations. He also offers a barter system. If you have an ingredient that you think would make a good flavor, you can exchange it for ice cream. The shop is closed to the public on Mondays. But you can learn how to make ice cream for free by joining Guzha for Monday morning churning. He’ll teach you the ropes, and you’ll get to take some dessert home."

According to local folklore, a serpent-like creature dwells within the pool of water at the bottom of the fall. The thunderous Howick Falls drop more than 300 feet. The falls also go by the name of KwaNogqaza, which translates to the “Place of the Tall One.” It’s said that only sangomas, the traditional healers of South Africa, can safely approach the falls. Legend says the Inkanyamba, a monstrous creature with a serpent’s body and a horse-sized head, lurks within the basin. The beast is believed to have the most power in the summer, when its rage sends storms rushing across the region. The serpent isn’t the only powerful aspect of the waterfall. People wading into the river atop the fall have been swept over the edge and sent to a brutal, watery demise. At least 40 deaths have been recorded since the falls were discovered by European explorers in the 1800s.","A platform offers the best view of the falls and is easily accessed by the nearby road.

50,District Six Museum,"Cape Town, South Africa",A sobering account of the vibrant multicultural neighborhood that was destroyed under apartheid.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/district-six-museum,"District Six, or “Distrik Ses” in Afrikaans, was a bohemian, mixed neighborhood in every sense of the word. It was crowded with a multiracial blend of working class people, Jews, Muslims, and Christians alike, many of whom were descended from formerly enslaved people and immigrants. In the mid-20th century, a population of roughly 60,000 lived there. Unfortunately, District Six was also at the epicenter of apartheid in Cape Town, and still bears its scars. After South Africa’s National Party gained power in 1948, its all-white government began enforcing policies of racial segregation known as apartheid. In the 1960s and 70s, the segregating Group Areas Act saw all the non-white residents of District Six evicted and relocated further outside the city. It was called “slum clearing,” and the true intention of the racial discrimination was to fill the desirably-located neighborhood with white residents and high rise buildings. District Six became a symbol of apartheid oppression. A group called Hands Off District Six protested the redevelopment of their bulldozed neighborhood. It remained empty. When anti-apartheid legislation came to fruition, reparations were paid to the resettled residents of the district. Some of them, along with their descendants, have been permitted to move back to the area. Others have been given financial compensation, but righting the wrongs is slow and still ongoing. The excellent and sobering District Six Museum provides context as well as rotating exhibits on the residents who were forcibly removed from their homes. Another highlight is St. Mark’s Anglican Church, built in 1867. The government was unable to bulldoze the historic religious building, and instead offered its clergy a resettlement stipend. They declined, and St. Mark’s continued to host the same community in the original location, now driving from all over Cape Town to attend service. What’s left of District Six is now part of the Zonnebloem neighborhood. A new generation has begun to rebuild there, but a small patch of land sits empty and deserted, a reminder of the cultural destruction that occurred.","The District Six Museum is located at 25A Albertus St & Buitenkant Street. Cape Town Free Walking Tours (http://www.nielsentours.co.za/capetown/) operates a free walking tour twice a day. Taking a tour is highly recommended, as it's easy to miss some of the landmarks if you don't know your way around."

A small patch of blue sky surrounded by a 173-meter-high cylindrical matrix of identical windows is all you can see. It is a dehumanizing habitat, an example of “Brutalist” architecture that was truly brutal. Ponte Tower, also known as the Ponte City Apartments, was built in 1975, and is still the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa. It is a 54-story tube with an open center to allow additional light to reach its inner apartments. The building was designed by Manfred Hermer. Ponte Tower was a true example of Apartheid-era thinking. The apartments facing the outside of the building were designated for rich white families while the inner apartments, in permanent twilight, were meant for their black servants. Life in the building became truly brutal after the fall of Apartheid. As crime rose in the once-upscale Hillbrow neighborhood, numerous gangs moved into the building. Ponte Tower became a center of organized crime activity, and life in the building become extremely unsafe. Owners all but abandoned the structure to decay.

This safari-themed castle in the South African bush is the Sun City Resort, a marvelous palace with a bizarre geopolitical history. Sun City Resort was built in 1979 by business magnate Sol Kerzner just northwest of Johannesburg. At the time, this region was under the autonomy of Bophuthatswan, an independent state created under apartheid. Kerzner chose the controversial region as the site of his palace because it was the nearest place to Johannesburg that permitted topless venues. Kerzner had always dreamed of building a “mythical royal residence built by a lost tribe” in the middle of the South African bush, and just that he did—Kerzner’s brainchild would make both Indiana Jones and Walt Disney proud. In addition to the countless statues of safari animals, the “Big Five”—lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants, and Cape buffalo—can be found in living form at the resort. In the adjacent Pilanesberg Game Reserve, visitors to the resort can self-drive their cars through the African bush. Past the majestic Palace of the Lost City and the sandy poolside beach, visitors can explore the largest maze in the entire Southern Hemisphere, a 300,000-piece mosaic of a lion killing a wildebeest, lamps held up by tiny monkey statues, and a 1.25-mile zipline, the fastest in the world.",

Intrigued? A typical shark cage diving excursion takes about three to five hours. You hop on the boat and are hustled away to prime shark territory near Dyer Island and Geyser Rock. It’s a rocky ride for some people, so if you have motion sickness this rocking rollicking boat could pose a problem. But you should probably tough it out because, sharks. The boat is side anchored at the shark-infested destination and you get wet-suited up. Your boat crew will begin to chum the water and a Tuna head attached to a strong rope is thrown in the water. Soon, you’ll see the almost cartoonish dorsal fins cut through the water. Once there are a good number of the beautiful animals swimming around, you jump into the cage, which is attached to the boat, and hold your breath. There’s no breathing equipment used here, so your sighting of the shark is contingent on how long you can hold your breath underwater. That being said, you will usually only need to have your breath held for 10 to 20 seconds at a time. After a few languid minutes of paddling around in your safety zone, you almost expect a scary background score to start playing as sharks up to 5 meters long finally take the bait and swim next to you in the cage. A cheap thrill and a sharp adrenalin rush? Yes. A close-up of nature’s incredible beauty? Yes. Smartest way to get a close-up view of the infamous ocean predator? Debatable. For the weak of heart? Definitely not. The dives are weather dependent, so it’s a good idea to stay in Gansbaai either overnight or for a day or two. The surrounding area is beautiful and unspoiled and there are some exciting things to do. There are eight shark dive operators that are all based out of the same harbor. Southern Right Whales are plentiful from June to December, so there is always a chance that you could see them on your ride out to or back from Dyer Island.",Travel on the N2 towards Caledon and then onto the R43 past Hermanus and Stanford to Gansbaai.

The surrounding area is mostly agricultural land known for its pineapple production. Farmers who settled in the area in the 18th century struggled to successfully grow crops until they began planting pineapples. So, naturally, locals decided to honor the fruit and the sweet earnings it brought by erecting a massive building in its shape. The Big Pineapple was constructed by members of Bathurst’s agricultural community in the 1980s. The building itself is three stories tall. It’s made of metal and fiberglass and features an observation platform. The inside of the pineapple contains a museum dedicated to the fruit with a variety of pineapple products available for sale.

Goats have been known to climb up on top of livestock, just for a slightly better view. In 1981, Fairview Wine and Cheese owner Charles Back, who had a herd of some 750 Saanen goats, had a genius idea. Why not build something the goats can climb on? In this way, the goat tower was born. Built out of brick and mortar with a steep metal roof and a spiraling wooden staircase, the goat tower even has windows, and the goats enjoy both climbing and resting inside the two-story tower. In honor of its goats, and the tower which has become a famous symbol of the winery, Fairview produces a wine called “Goats do Roam,” a play on the French wine growing region Côtes du Rhône. Though this is the first known purpose-built goat tower, others followed in Fairview’s footsteps and three other goat towers are known to exist. The other goat towers include the six-story, 31-foot-tall Tower of Baaa, constructed by farmer David Johnson, to serve his herd of 34 Saanen milk goats in Findlay, Illinois. (As Johnson says, “Goats are the most curious animals in the world so they use the tower a lot. They come and go, passing each other on the ramp as needed.”) Johnson plans to also utilize the tower as an amateur observatory, which would make this certainly the only goat tower/observatory in the world. There is yet another goat tower on the Ekeby Farm in Moss, Norway, built by Finn-Erik Blakstad, based on and with permission from Fairview owner Charles Back. His goat tower serves as an advertisement for the restaurant he runs which utilizes the goats’ milk and cheese. And last but not least, there is the goat tower in the back of Silky O’Sullivans, a bar in Memphis Tennessee, where patrons sneak beers to the goats who happily chug them down and then go climb the tower. Though the goats climb this tower while sauced, the goats can apparently hold their beer, as there has yet to be a single accident involving a falling goat.",

An even larger 83.5-carat diamond was found on the slopes of a small hill called Colesberg Kopje, which led to the first diamond rush in the area. Besieged by fortune hunters, the De Beers brothers sold their farm and moved elsewhere. Miners started arriving by the thousands. A frontier town, New Rush, was quickly built up, and spacious homes rose from the dust. In June 1873, New Rush was renamed Kimberley after John Wodehouse, Earl of Kimberley and British Secretary of State for the Colonies. Among the most ambitious prospectors were two Englishmen, Cecil J. Rhodes and Barney Barnato. Ambitious and enterprising, they bought one holding after another and became the biggest mine owners in the area. In 1888, they merged their companies, and so was born De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited, the forerunner of the firm that still plays a leading role on the diamond stage today, and still has its headquarters in Kimberley. Kimberley’s complex web of roads is a topographic reminder of a chaotic past. And not one but five big holes, and a number of smaller mines, have been gouged out of the earth, reaching ever deeper into its bluish, diamond-bearing Kimberlite pipes. The largest, the Kimberley Mine, or “Big Hole,” covered 170,000 square meters, reached a depth of 240 meters, and yielded three tons of diamonds. The mine was closed in 1914, although three of the holes – Du Toitspan, Wesselton and Bultfontein – continued operating until 2005. Today the Big Hole is part of a larger museum. This is a unique open-air museum with viewing platforms and a wide selection of original houses, offices, and shops. The museum boasts Kimberley’s oldest house (imported from England in 1877), The Digger’s Rest pub, Barney Barnato’s boxing academy, a tobacconist shop, a reconstruction of the De Beers’ homestead, and mock diamond diggings.",
60,Tswaing Meteorite Crater,"Soshanguve, South Africa",An ancient impact crater on the outskirts of Pretoria.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tswaing-meteorite-crater,"Tswaing, meaning “place of salt” in the Setswana language, is an ancient impact crater outside the metropolis of Pretoria in South Africa’s Gauteng province. The Tswaing Crater formed some 220,000 years ago when a giant meteorite slammed into the Earth, creating a half-mile-wide crater and destroying all vegetation within a 25-mile radius. Today, a blind salt lake lies at the bottom of the crater, and the area is surrounded by dense tree growth. This natural wonder is a feature in the region that even a fair amount of locals aren’t unaware of. Yet it is clear that early humans in the area knew of the crater site. Stone Age implements and pottery have been discovered at the crater rim, where deposits of salt were collected by these early inhabitants from the lake at the bottom of the hole. In the early 20th century, salt and soda ash were mined commercially from the crater lake. The mining went on for nearly 50 years, lasting until the 1950s. The remains of these activities are still present as ruins around the crater. At the center of the crater lake, you can see the remains of several boreholes from the drilling that helped confirm the meteoric origin of the crater. The Tswaing Crater now lies within a protected reserve, with several hiking trails leading up to the crater rim and down to the lake.","Driving north on the R80 towards Soshanguve, turn right on Mopanie Road/M35 and then left onto Soutpan Road. The Tswaing Crater entrance will be to your left, off Soutpan Road. An entry fee grants access to secure parking and a picnic site, with the 7km return trail to the crater starting from there. A permit can be obtained at additional cost to drive up to the crater rim viewpoint to park and start a shortened hike from there."
61,Nelson Mandela Capture Site,"Howick, South Africa",A mesmerizing sculpture marks the site where the activist was arrested after evading capture for 17 months.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nelson-mandela-capture-site,"On August 5, 1962, Nelson Mandela was driving along a nondescript road, pretending to be a chauffeur for Cecil Williams, a communist activist. The police, having been tipped off that Mandela might be passing through, stopped the car. They arrested Mandela, who had spent 17 months evading capture. Today, a visitor center and a shape-shifting sculpture mark the site of Mandela’s arrest. The museum inside the center tells Mandela’s life story, with a focus on the time around his arrest and his subsequent 27 years in jail. The information presents his story in a thoughtful, creative way. Release, the sculpture outside the visitor center, is just as compelling as the material contained inside. It’s made of 50 steel columns and was installed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Mandela’s arrest. The work was created by Marco Cianfanelli and Jeremy Rose. The sculpture is a far more eye-catching display than the old marker, a plaque set into the side of the wall along the road. When viewed from the right angle, the poles take the shape of Mandela’s face. Change your position, and his image disappears, leaving behind only a forest of rigid steel.","The sculpture is based on the R50, close by to the N3 and Howick/Pietermaritzburg. Opening times as of summer 2018 are Monday through Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. There is an entry fee. Tours of the site can be arranged online."
62,The Post Office Tree,"Mossel Bay, South Africa",South Africa's postal service began with a letter left in a boot beneath this tree.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-post-office-tree-mossel-bay-south-africa,"This ancient milkwood tree, located in Mossel Bay, South Africa, is believed to be the country’s very first mailbox. In 1500, a Portuguese sea captain named Pêro de Ataíde lost much of his fleet in a storm off the Southern Cape. Before returning to India, he wrote a message reporting the damage and warning of rough waters to the East. Ataíde tucked the message in a boot dangling from a milkwood tree near a spring where sailors often drew water. Miraculously, the message was retrieved by its intended recipient, Joao de Nova, the very next year. The tree became a de facto post office box, where sailors would exchange letters protected in boots, iron pots, or beneath rocks. Seamen would leave their messages behind, trusting that their countrymen would pick them up and deliver them to their correct destination, albeit very slowly. The tree, now believed to be approximately 600 years old, still continues to send and receive mail. A large post office box shaped like a giant boot has been constructed beneath the tree, where people can send letters anywhere in the world and receive a special stamp. Presumably, delivery now takes less than a year.","The tree is located in the Bartholomeu Dias Museum Complex located in Mossel Bay. Admission is free; however, for a small fee you can board a recreation of Bartholomeu Dias' caravel. The shop in the maritime museum sells both postcards and stamps for sending mail all over the world."
63,Afrikaans Language Monument,"Paarl, South Africa","The South African dialect's complex history is immortalized in stone, in one of the world's only monuments dedicated to a language.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/afrikaans-language-monument,"The Afrikaans language, spoken mainly in South Africa and Namibia, originated as a dialect of Dutch, brought to the Cape area by settlers from the Dutch East India Company in the late 17th century. “Afrikaans” is the Dutch word for “African,” and the language was once called “Cape Dutch.” This very paradox and the language’s complex political history, is depicted in stone by the Afrikaans language monument in South Africa. Over time, Afrikaans evolved into a distinct language with strong influences from other African languages, like Khoikhoi, Nguni, and Sotho, as well other European languages like French and Portuguese. The monument’s design reflects this progression: The three columns become progressively shorter, representing the waning influence of the European languages like Dutch and French, and the three convex mounds grow in size to indicate the increasing role played by African tongues. These connect to the soaring obelisk that forms the main part of the structure, inspired by writer C.J. Langenhoven, who called Afrikaans a “rapidly ascending curve.” It is open at the top, signifying that the lexicon is alive and continues to grow. It is thought to be the only monument in the world dedicated to a language. Visible from miles away, it is imposing sight, watching over the region where it was born and is still a dominant force, the third most spoken language in South Africa. The Afrikaans language became closely intertwined with South Africa’s political history, especially after the Anglo-Boer war of 1899-1902, when there was a strong push to establish English as the language of intellect. As a response against this, organizations were created to promote Afrikaans and the Afrikaner culture. In 1925, it was recognized as an official language with its own African identity, separate from its parent Dutch. However, the language’s most famous word became “apartheid,” meaning “apartness,” after the brutal racial segregation policy put into place in the mid-20th century. Afrikaans itself came to be associated with white supremacy, and was tangled in controversy all through the later half of the century. The monument designed by Jan van Wijk is a granite tribute to this tumultuous history. The sculptor won a competition to design the structure, which was opened in 1975, 50 years after the language was given official status.",Access provided by road to entrance on the hill.
64,Cape Agulhas Marker,"L'Agulhas, South Africa",This small monument marks the divide between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans at the southernmost tip of Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cape-agulhas-marker,"Though not nearly as celebrated as the Cape of Good Hope, this chunk of South Africa’s coastline is still special. It’s the southern tip of Africa, and according to the International Hydrographic Organization marks the line where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans split. A small stone bearing a sea-green plaque explains the cape’s geographical significance. An additional sign shows the divide between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. It’s amazing to stand at the continent’s most southerly spot. Look toward the water, and you realize you’re gazing upon two great oceans while the whole entire continent stretches behind your back. Cape Agulhas may not be super famous among tourists, but it is renowned among sailors. The waters around the cape are notoriously turbulent and unpredictable. Winter storms whip the waters into a hellish frenzy, and waves up to 100 feet tall have caused even large ships to succumb to their fury. It’s estimated that about 150 ships have sunk there within the last few centuries. The nearby lighthouse is also worth checking out. It’s the second oldest still-operating beacon in South Africa and now houses a small museum.",Accessible via a gravel road south of Cape Agulhas Lighthouse.
65,Foreshore Freeway Bridge,"Cape Town, South Africa","Despite many attempts to finish this overpass, it has been abandoned since the 1970s.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/foreshore-freeway-bridge,"The Foreshore Freeway Bridge, also known as Cape Town’s “unfinished bridge,” was part of a big infrastructure project that was conceptualized in the late 1960s. Traffic congestion was predicted to increase in the years to come, and a ring highway was suggested as a solution to foster better traffic flow with as little disturbance as possible. The construction started in the early 1970s but stopped without any clear explanation in 1977. Its sudden end has spawned urban legends that try to explain why the construction came to such an abrupt halt. One theory is that a shopkeeper refused to sell his property so the bridge could pass though it, effectively grinding construction to a halt. Another one is that a construction error made it impossible to link the two ends of the bridge together. Numerous attempts to finish construction have been made over the years, but have all failed for one reason or another. As recently as February 2018, a contractor was chosen to complete the unfinished highways but work was, once again, halted, this time because of alleged tender irregularities. For the time being, the bridge will stay the way it is and continue to be used as a parking space, the backdrop for TV shows and fashion shoots, or maybe again as a stand for a giant vuvuzela like it was during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.",
66,Motouleng Caves,"Thabo Mofutsanyane, South Africa",The subterranean sanctuary home to local shamans is a sacred site for people of all religions.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/motouleng-fertility-caves,"Clay and stone huts dot the floor of South Africa’s Motouleng Caves, one of the largest rock overhangs in the Southern Hemisphere. Tepees made from straw and grass are scattered throughout the ramshackle dwellings. A large number of pilgrims journey to be healed by its resident sangomas, or shamans. The healers live within the caves for weeks, months, or even years at a time. Non-healers, too, will sometimes stay for extended periods, often with animals like cats, goats, and chickens in tow. As the holy caves is a sacred pilgrimage destination for women hoping to get pregnant, some refer to Motouleng as the “Fertility Caves.” People of all religions are welcome at this sacred site. You’ll find practitioners of traditional African religions praying and performing rituals alongside Christian ministers. People dance, sing, and make offerings to appease the ancient ancestors. There’s a fountain at the entrance of the cave, where you can drop a coin into its depths for good luck. Water from the river that flows in the valley below is sometimes included in the ceremonial rituals. The cavern is part of a broader network of sacred caves within this region of South Africa. People have been journeying to these subterranean chambers for thousands of years, leaving rock paintings behind in their wake. Even dinosaurs once passed through, as evidenced by the footprints found on some of the caves’ floors.","As this is a sacred place, be sure to dress appropriately. Entry is free. It is a short and beautiful walk alongside the sacred Caledon River, which flows through the valley leading up to the cave."
67,Ronnie's Sex Shop,"Breede River DC, South Africa","“The oddest pub in South Africa,” inspired by a practical joke.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ronnies-sex-shop,"Ronnie’s Sex Shop, located in the rural bush of South Africa, is known as the “oddest pub in South Africa,” and not without reason. Complete with odd decor, a ceiling covered in clothing, and a strange name born out of a prank, the bar attracts pub-goers from around the world for its weird etymology and sense of humor. One day in the 1970s, in the Western Cape province of South Africa, Ronnie Price decided to open a farm stand on Cape Route 62 to sell his fruits and vegetables. To announce his farm stand to passerby, Ronnie painted “Ronnie’s Shop” in red paint on the white facade of his roadside cottage. But as a practical joke, a few of Ronnie’s buddies bought some red paint and renamed the cottage “Ronnie’s Sex Shop.” At first, Ronnie wasn’t pleased with the prank, but his mind changed when a friend of his suggested, “why don’t you just open a pub?” When Ronnie realized the brilliance of his friends’ idea, he converted the farm stand into a fully stocked bar, serving coffee in the morning and booze at night. Hung across the bar’s ceiling are over 100 t-shirts, bras, and pairs of underwear with writing on them for decoration. Strewn across the pub are a variety of random objects, including teddy bears, clown wigs, and baby dolls. Today, nearly four decades later, Ronnie still runs the bar. The interior of the bar’s white building is covered from wall to wall in graffiti with personal sex stories of its visitors, with “I had sex here” written on one of the benches. Home to road trippers and motorcyclists from around the world (as well as a handful of local farmers), Ronnie’s Sex Shop even offers accommodation for those who’ve had one too many.",
68,Orlando Towers,"Soweto, South Africa",Two giant painted cooling towers make for one of the world’s most epic bungee jumps.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/orlando-towers,"Walking through Soweto’s Orlando township, home to some of South Africa’s most infamous anti-apartheid clashes in the 20th century, it is nearly impossible to miss the two Orlando Towers. Since the township is made up almost entirely of one-story houses, the 33-story towers are in plain sight from practically every angle, towering in the distance. In 1942, both the population and the energy consumption of Johannesburg were quickly growing. To meet this increasing energy demand, British engineers constructed the Orlando Power Station in the adjacent city of Soweto. The coal plant successfully ran for over five decades until 1998, when it was decommissioned. Although the original power plant building collapsed in 2014, the power station’s two cooling towers have remained upright, and they have left a highly influential mark on the city. Before the plant was decommissioned the Orlando Towers were plain and drab, but since 1998 the cooling towers have been given a flamboyant new paint job, a reflection of the cultural renaissance of the community. In the words of local resident Tshepo Motsepe, Orlando is the “quintessence of the township, intertwining urban culture, history and heritage, communal living and camaraderie, a techno-savvy population, and social amenities.” This atmosphere is easily reflected in the beautifully painted towers, which show vibrant symbolism of soccer, music, fashion, and historical figures. Nowadays, something even more thrilling is happening at the Orlando Towers: since 2009, the towers have been the launchpad for one of the world’s most epic bungee jumps. After being lifted over 300 feet in the air, adrenaline junkies can walk across a narrow bridge lofted between the two towers, enjoying a beautiful yet terrifying view of Soweto along the way. From the top, visitors can bungee jump, abseil, freefall, and power swing, making the Orlando Towers the perfect combination of culture and adventure.",

Located around the small village of Vredefort which lies near the center of the impact zone, the remaining ripples and rings of the huge earthen wound are only fully visible from space. The original crater is thought to have been around 190 miles in diameter although the more dramatic slopes have been worn down in the millennia since the meteoric impact. The crater is also one of the only ancient impact sites to feature multiple rings which speaks to the sheer violence of the collision which occurred billions of years in the past. With local development in the area threatening to erase the geologic rarity, the Vredefort Dome within the crater was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2005.",
