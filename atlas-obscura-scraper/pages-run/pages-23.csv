0,Krupaj Spring,"Milanovac, Serbia",Legends of treasure and spirits flow from this this fairy tale-like oasis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/krupaj-spring,"According to local lore, there’s much more to this dazzlingly colorful spring than meets the eye. Legend says the Homolje Mountains swallowed a large amount of gold and hid it in the Golden Cave deep under the Krupaj Spring, where the treasure is guarded by the aquatic spirit of Tartor. Each year, on the “devils day,” the spirit hits the drums and calls other spirits to a celebration. Only on that day is the entrance to the mystical cave open. Vlach women who want great power enter the river at night to meet the spirit. In return, the spirit demands a prize, usually a beautiful young woman. The spring is not only a source of Vlach myths and legends. It’s also an ecological oasis. The hypnotizing turquoise water is surrounded by plants, their branches descending into the cold water like the arms of great forest guardians. Above the lake rises a picturesque cave, fulfilling the fairy tale-like backdrop. Underneath the lake is a maze of underground canals, which are challenging even for the most experienced divers. The stream of the spring, 1,427 feet (435 meters) long, confluences with the Krupaj River. A dam built near the spring creates an attractive waterfall as well.",intriguing environs legends natural wonders ecosystems water nature
1,Golubac Fortress,"Golubac, Serbia",This 14th century castle withstood years of battle but is now sliding off the hills into the Danube.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golubac-castle,"Golubac Fortress is one of the best preserved medieval fortresses in Europe. Yet the advent of modern technology has submerged some of the outer walls of this storied Serbian fortification, finally causing the decay of a powerful compound that survived years of war and battle. Comprised of 10 different towers protecting three internal compounds, Golubac Fortress was a powerhouse guarding the Danube. Despite its formidable structure, it changed hands many times throughout its existence, but even war and constant attack could not destroy the thick stone walls. Unfortunately, the only thing strong enough to begin the death of Golubac was modern technology. In 1964, a hydroelectric dam on the Danube caused flooding along its shores. The rising water levels eventually submerged Golubac’s outer walls along the lower bank. Along with the Danube’s invasion of the fortress, a road was created that passed through the walls, once again proving that the only way to breach Golubac was with the technology of modern progress and infrastructure. In 2005, a campaign to restore the overgrown fortress was undertaken and Golubac is now a popular tourist site in Serbia, especially during boat tours of the Danube.",outsider architecture ruins architectural oddities architecture
2,The Skull Tower of Nis,"Niš, Serbia",Structure built from the skulls of vanquished foes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skull-tower-nis,"Piling up heaps of skulls of your vanquished foes represented the apogee of barbaric warlord behavior. This ancient practice survived in some cultures well into the historic times. Ćele Kula, (lit. Skull Tower) in Niš Serbia, built in 1809 by Turkish general Hurshi Pasha out of skulls of defeated Serb rebels represents one of the most recent and best preserved examples of this tradition. The year 1809 marked the turning point in the course of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire (1804-1813). The outnumbered rebel army faced a 36,000 strong force of Turkish imperial guards near the strategically important southern city of Niš. Rather then surrender or flee they decided to put up a desperate last stand at Čegar Hill. Faced with imminent annihilation, the rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić in an act of desperation fired a shot into a gunpowder keg at the fully stocked gun powder room, blowing up his entire army as well as wiping out enemy soldiers who were already flooding the rebel trenches. Deeply angered by the rebel force’s actions, the Turkish commander Hurshid Pasha decided to teach a grim lesson to the Serbian nation. The bodies of the dead rebels were mutilated. Their skins were pealed off their decapitated heads, stuffed up with straw, and sent to the Imperial court in Istanbul as proof of Turkish victory. The skulls were used as building blocks for a tower built by the main road at the entrance of the city. A warning to the local populace of an impending fate to any potential future rebels. In total, 952 skulls were used. In its original form, the tower stood 15 feet high and 13 feet wide. Skulls were arranged in 56 rows, with 17 skulls in each row, at each side of the tower. The skull of rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić was placed at the top. This gruesome edifice, left a deep scar in the Serbian national psyche. However, it failed at its purpose. The Serbs rebelled again in 1815, this time successfully, driving off the Turks and winning independence in 1830. In the years immediately following the building of the tower, the families of deceased rebels chiseled away some of the skulls in order to give them proper funerals. Today 58 skulls in total remain in the tower. The authorities of Serbia in 1892 built a chapel around the tower to preserve this unique monument representing the nations bravery and sufferings. The skull of Stevan Sinđelić is also on display at the chapel. As an added curiosity, a nearby brick factory bears the name of ?ele Kula.",ossuaries skulls memento mori towers catacombs and crypts
3,Belgrade Tesla Museum,"Belgrade, Serbia","Nikola Tesla's ashes are held in a golden sphere, surrounded by his works.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/belgrade-tesla-museum,"In the center of Belgrade, a villa holds the world’s largest collection dedicated to the life and work of scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla. Famous for his rivalry with Thomas Edison — and for his invention of the alternating current (AC) current electrical system, the induction motor, most likely radio transmission, and, of course, the Tesla coil — Tesla’s heritage is complicated. He was an ethnic Serbian, but an Austrian citizen, born in what was at the time the Austrian Empire, now Croatia. He lived his professional life in Budapest and Paris, then moved to America. He later became an American citizen, and he died in New York City in 1943. Ten years after his death, his records were transferred by his nephew to the new museum in Belgrade. The museum consists of seven display rooms holding thousands of documents, books, photographs, and equipment belonging to Tesla. Several models are on display, including one of the famous Wardenclyffe laboratory in New York. The collection was named part of the UNESCO Memory of the World program, dedicated to the preservation of documents and materials related to world knowledge, in 2003. The museum is currently engaged in a program of digitizing the documents in their collection. Tesla’s ashes are held in a golden sphere in the third room, and his death mask is in the last. There are several other, smaller tributes to Tesla around the world, including a small museum and statue dedicated in 2006 in his hometown of Smiljan, Croatia.",nicola tesla obscura day locations electrical oddities strange science relics and reliquaries instruments of science museums
4,Uvac River Meanders,"Družiniće, Serbia",A sinuous path among steep cliffs creates a stunning sight in southwestern Serbia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uvac-river-meanders,"Over its course of 119 km (74 miles), the Uvac River carves a deep and winding valley through a dramatic karst landscape of mountain peaks, towering escarpments, and expansive caves. Among such engaging terrain, the Meanders stand out as a particularly striking portion of the Uvac River’s ruggedly picturesque channel. The Meanders are formed by a series of tightly packed, looping arches that the river has sculpted out of its limestone bed over the millennia. In this stretch, the canyon walls can soar up to 100 meters (328 feet) above the twisting and turning waters below. The result is a natural setting that is as impressive from any elevation. The Uvac River Meanders are part of the Uvac Special Nature Reserve, a protected area first created in 1971 that now encompasses a total of 7543 ha (29 square miles). The reserve is home to several notable species of birds and fish, including the osprey, eagle owl, goosander, chub, barbel, huchen, and sneep. The area is particularly popular among vulture lovers, as it serves as a sanctuary for the griffon vulture, a bird featured on many Serbian coats of arms whose wingspan can reach 3 meters (10 feet). The griffon vulture faced extinction as recently as 20 years ago, but is now thriving in the Uvac River Valley, thanks in large part to conservation groups that have set up large “outdoor restaurants” for the scavengers, stocked with carrion and slaughterhouse waste. The majestic birds can often be seen perched on the cliffs overlooking the Meanders.  Boat tours are available, but only via authorized guides, as restrictions are in place to limit numbers of visitors.

Holocaust memorials solemnly honor the dead from Berlin to New York. Russia is speckled with hallowed battlegrounds where the bodies claimed by the winter war fell two-deep. The Normandy American Cemetery is the most vast and haunting American service cemetery outside of Arlington National Cemetery. In Serbia, things were just as bad. Bubanj Memorial Park marks and honors the location of one of the most horrific mass executions of the entire war, where more thаn 10,000 Serbs were taken prisoner, gathered and unceremoniously shot by invading German forces. Estimates of the brutal event’s toll range between ten and twelve thousand lives lost to the execution. The majority of the victims were citizens оf the Serbian city of Niš, which is where the memorial park іs located. Bubanj Memorial Park is at once a stark and empty locale meant to inspire reflection and honor, but also a functioning public park, complete with memorial trails and monuments. At the park’s center, a 23 x 2.5 meter marble monument consisting of five separate monoliths abstractly symbolizing the progression of the war and its effect on the local populace, moving from German invasion and execution squads to Serbian resistance and eventual victory.

It is a more fitting decoration than one might realize. Controlled at various times by the Serbs, Turks, Hungarians, and Austrians, the small dark Ružica church has seen a lot of action. The space the church now occupies was, for over 100 years, used by the Turks as a gunpowder magazine. The church had to be largely rebuilt after World War I. Though damaged by bombings, there was an upshot to the devastation. While fighting alongside England and the US, Serbian soldiers on the front line used their downtime to craft the incredible chandeliers from the materials available to them: the spent shells and weaponry that lay strewn around the battlefield.

Built in 1970 by sculptor Vojin Stojic and architect Gradimir Medakovic, the brutalist monument celebrates a group of partisan fighters in World War II who battled against the German occupation in the south of Belgrade. During the fighting, the battalions lost over 5,000 soldiers but their “guns of freedom kept shooting.” The monument itself sits atop the highest peak in the region like some sort of Christmas star crowning a mountain-sized tree.

8,Western City Gate of Belgrade,"Belgrade, Serbia",A pair of connected skyscrapers form this symbolic gateway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/western-city-gate-of-belgrade,"The Western City Gate in Belgrade is not so much an actual throughway into the city as it is a massive portal that has been created by a couple of linked towers, capped with a restaurant as a crown. Alternately known as the Genex Tower, the Western City Gate was built in 1977 as both a commercial and residential space, divided between the two skyscrapers. The towers are exemplars of the angular brutalist style and look not unlike something plucked from a sci-fi dystopia. The shorter of the two towers (at 26 stories tall) is actually home to the Genex company offices among other office space, while just across the gap is a taller tower (standing 30 stories tall) that is reserved for residential space. All said and done, the skyscraper(s) rank as Serbia’s second tallest buildings. The pair of towers are connected at top by a two story foot bridge that not only allows people to travel between the structures, but also provides for some amazing views of Belgrade. On top of one end of the bridge is circular revolving restaurant reminiscent of the pinnacle of the Space Needle in Seattle if that were perched atop a grim spire. Anymore, the sides of the well-known building are plastered with advertisements that often hang down the length of the structure. Even with these bright ads giving some color to the structure, its brutalist look manages to shine through, and this symbolic city gate remains a rather dour introduction (or final image) for the city.",brutalism towers architectural oddities architecture
9,Drina River House,"Bajina Bašta, Serbia","For over 40 years, this quaint little house has teetered on a rock in the middle of a river.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drina-river-house,"Outside the town of Bajina Bašta, at the narrows of the Drina River, a curious little house has rested on its rocky perch since 1969. For more than 40 years, this increasingly famous, nameless cabin has balanced atop a rock in the middle of the river. It has been miraculously spared by the annual rising and falling of waters. According to the story of its construction, a group of youth became enamored with the spot after noting the outcropping in the middle of the Drina River was an ideal place to tan and swim. In the following year, the owner undertook the laborious task of building the house on the rock by hand, which he acknowledges could not have happened without the help of his friends. Since that time, the one-room cabin has served as a holiday respite for its creator. At the time of its construction, all the house’s building materials were rowed out by the boatload. Little has changed today, as a watery traverse through the swiftly flowing currents of the Drina remains the only way of reaching the rock on which the house sits. After National Geographic published an image of the unnamed little house as its “Photo of the Day,” outsiders began making pilgrimages to the banks of the Drina in order to verify its existence with their own eyes. In the process, they’ve been given a glimpse into the greater beauty of the surrounding Tara National Park, which has been shortlisted by UNESCO to receive coveted protection status since 2002. The park is a mountain refuge known for its dense forests, steep limestone cliffs, and deep canyons formed by the Drina’s upper reaches. Sometimes referred to as the “River of Life,” the Drina itself first gained pre-Internet fame more than half a century ago thanks to Nobel Prize-winning author Ivo Andrić, who introduced the world to its waters as an immortal bearer of life’s greatest struggles, through works such as 1945’s The Bridge on the Drina. Though not exactly off-limits to outsiders, the budding landmark is a piece of private property and should be respected as such.",national parks rivers houses homes
10,Ruins of Yugoslav Army Headquarters,"Belgrade, Serbia",Destroyed Serbian army headquarters sits half crumbled in a largely revitalized Belgrade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-yugoslav-army-hq,"The 1990s were a turbulent, war-ravaged decade on the Balkan peninsula. But in last 10 years a lot has changed and Serbia has once again largely re-integrated into European society. Traces of the wars of the 1990s are hard to find in Belgrade, except of course for the gaping ruin of the ex-Yugoslav/Serbian Army headquarters. The building was hit several times during the NATO campaign. The bombing of the building was primarily of symbolic importance, as all essential command functions had already been evacuated to a secure location in the days prior to the outbreak of the war. After the end of hostilities the building was deemed too damaged for immediate repair and it remains in the same bombed-out condition to this day. If its destruction was largely symbolic, so too is its continued state of disrepair. For many Serbs, the destroyed army headquarters has become a monument to the lost war, and a morbid tourist attraction for foreign visitors.

11,Tito's Blue Train,"Belgrade, Serbia",Ride in 1960s style on the private luxury train Marshal Josip Tito used to travel around Yugoslavia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/titos-blue-train,"In an unassuming railway depot south of Belgrade lies a relic of a forgotten era. Built in a time when Yugoslavia was recovering from the Second World War, this iconic blue train served to transport the country’s leaders around the different republics of Yugoslavia, and entertain foreign dignitaries so critical to the diplomatic success of the socialist nation. The Blue Train, Marshal Josip Tito’s private train, was built with luxury in mind. Tito preferred to travel by rail, and as Yugoslavia became more prosperous in the years after the war, the train reflected the optimism and wealth of its primary user, if not that of the average citizen. Custom-built coaches were decorated in a simple yet modern socialist realist style, with certain classical holdovers such as intricate mosaics and dark hardwood lining. The overall effect is one of understated power, which comes as no surprise considering some of the train’s clientele. Used often by Tito for domestic purposes, the Blue Train also served an important diplomatic role. Its guest list is a veritable who’s-who of 1960s power players, from Queen Elizabeth to Charles de Gaulle to Yasser Arafat. It’s easy to imagine diplomats and party officials seated around the massive main dining table or crammed into the modernist, Zodiac-themed bar, as Tito sought to provide the world a path between the American-led West and the Soviet sphere of influence. It’s still possible to enjoy the splendor of the Blue Train, which has been remarkably preserved in its original state.  If your pocketbook is big enough, you can do so as Tito did: for a hefty fee, the Serbian Railways will hook up the train for a trip on the spectacular Belgrade-Bar railway. The line is one of Tito’s biggest public works projects and one of the most scenic rail journeys in Europe; the 296-mile route between the Serbian capital and the Montenegro  coast passes over 435 bridges and through 54 tunnels. For those whose wallets aren’t quite as fat, it’s still possible to enjoy the Blue Train, and walk through the very same cars where Haile Selassie sat, Queen Elizabeth dined, and Josip Broz Tito slept.  To visit the train, you'll need to purchase a ticket, which can be a small adventure in itself. The historical railway station where they were once sold has now been closed, but try the Beograd Centar station VIP or Information desks. Try to find a clerk that speaks English, and explain you want to see the ""Blue Train."" Failing this, the words in Serbian are ""Plavi Voz."" It helps to email ahead using the address on the Serbian Railways' website under ""Special Services."" And, if all else fails, the folks at the Serbian Railway Museum in downtown Belgrade, some of whom speak excellent English, are very helpful in arranging a visit. Once you have a ticket, just hop on the #3 tram and ride all the way to the Rasadnik stop—the depot is just across the railway tracks. Be cautious when crossing these and entering the depot--in addition to frequent train traffic the depot is actively used as a railway maintenance facility and there is frequent movement of heavy equipment. Show your ticket to the guard just past the main depot doors, and if they are open and there are some available workers, they'll open the train.",communism presidents preservation soviet history railroads politics trains history

It was built by King Peter I of Serbia. The temple is a monumental building. Its interior is covered with more than 40 million pieces of colorful glass, creating a dazzling array of more than 15,000 shades of color. The mosaics, which pay tribute to the most prominent Serbian medieval frescoes and monasteries, surround the marble floor and iconostasis. The church wasn’t always meant to have such wonderful mosaics. Originally, King Peter intended to have the names of all the soldiers who died in the Balkan Wars carved into the wall. But the king perished before the church was complete, and the start of World War I meant a new conflict was soon to claim more soldiers’ lives. The upper part of the church contains the tombs of the founders of the Karađorđević dynasty. Six generations of the family, including Prince Alexander and King Alexander I, were buried in the church. Down in the crypt, you’ll find 39 additional tombs.  The church is located on the Oplenac Hill, near the town of Topola.

It’s located on a hilltop surrounded by the curvy Ibar river. The name Maglič is said to come from the Serbian word magla meaning fog, as the hill underneath often disappears in the mist. It’s unknown when the castle was constructed, but it’s believed to have been done so on the orders of either Stefan the First-Crowned or his son Uroš the Great. The castle was designed to safeguard the monasteries of Sopoćani and Studenica, and also to prevent further Mongolian raids into Serbian lands. However, a local legend tells a different story of the castle’s history. It’s said that Serbian despotess Jerina, also known as “The Damned Jerina,” founder of many medieval fortresses, constructed the castle and threw many of her lovers into the deep well inside the walls. Among the locals, the castle is still known as Jerina’s Town. Another legend claims that Uroš the Great planted a valley of lilac flowers along the Ibar river gorge below the castle, to make his French wife, Helen of Anjou, feel more at home. The castle consists of seven towers and one dungeon tower connected with ramparts and stone walls. The interior can be accessed through two gates. Inside the fortress are the remains of a palace, barracks, water reservoir, a well, and the Church of Saint George. After World War I, the castle was partly restored. The main restoration took place during the 1980s, and then again in 2010. The castle is recognized as a Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance by the Republic of Serbia.  The castle offers amazing views and is a short walk up a hill.",empire castles history & culture history

According to the manager, Djenka Mihajlovic, the gavez herb is used in folk medicine to “fix bones” and local folklore describes its use for magic by witches. Opening with a series of rock concerts in the summer of 1999, Gavez Klub was an ambassador of the hope that came across the people of Belgrade just three months after the NATO-inflicted bombings of the city. At that time, the venue was just a big yard with a small house and a few benches and tables made from fallen trees. Over the years, Gavez has grown and become a beloved gathering spot for Belgrade locals and a favorite place to take friends visiting from abroad due to its off-the-beaten path location and rich, homestyle cuisine. The limited menu changes daily and consists of just one set of courses to choose from as well as an array of house-made rakijas, a regional spirit infused with various fruits and herbs. In addition to rakijas made with grapes, plums, and pear, Gavez Klub’s herb-infused rakijas have purported healing benefits, including fighting off colds. Each menu item is prepared using ingredients from local markets and, while it may resemble a pre fixe menu with one option for each course, guests are welcome to order just one or two items instead of having the full array of offerings. Not only a restaurant, Gavez Klub also operates as a venue for concerts, art festivals, weddings, theater productions, yoga classes, and support groups. Regarding their clientele, Mihajlovic says, “We could never choose our guests; we did try, but it never worked out. All layers of society, all people of different ages, families, couples, single or lovers they all found Gavez and in some point of their lives made it their own.”  Check their Facebook page before going, as they're sometimes closed for private events.",food as medicine forests alcohol Unique Restaurants & Bars ecosystems

The church and monastery were allegedly built by the servant of Stefan Nemanja, the medieval Grand Prince of the Serbian Grand Principality. The Hermitage of Saint Sava consists of several cells and it’s believed that Saint Sava, Stefan Nemanja’s son and the first Archbishop of Serbia, spent some time at the monastery.

Add to that fact its emblematic power for a religious community decimated by war, and Subotica’s synagogue assumes a status of precious relic nonpareil. We may have failed to mention that it’s an extraordinarily beautiful building, too. The Jewish community of Subotica has existed amidst nonstop political tumult since 1775. During the era of the Inquisition, Serbia took in those fleeing persecution in Portugal and Spain, welcomed by the Ottoman Empire’s Sultan Bayezid II. After the Habsburgs seized Subotica and its surrounding lands, the cityscape slowly morphed into a gorgeous byproduct of all these colliding aesthetics, simultaneously persevering and coexisting in spite of themselves. As the Jewish community was systematically erased for ethnic and religious reasons throughout World War II, the synagogue continues to stand as a poignant, positive symbol of cultural confluence. Designed in tandem by architects Dezső Jakab and Marcell Komor and built in 1901 from brick punctuated with bright Zsolnaj ceramics, the house of worship is a hybrid of Western Art Nouveau detailing and Eastern motifs, featuring floral and zoomorphic ornamentation tucked around its portals, windows, and attic. The World Monuments Fund to designated the Subotica Synagogue among their list of “100 Most Endangered Monuments of Cultural Significance” in the world in the year 2000. Since 2003 it has undergone extensive restoration both inside and out. As of March 2018, the synagogue has been formally open after the reconstruction works have been finished.",synagogue synagogues art nouveau architecture
18,Kadinjača Memorial Complex,"Zlatiborski okrug, Serbia",A grand Yugoslav memorial to the group of partisans who fought and died resisting western Serbia’s Nazi occupation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kadinjaca-memorial-complex,"In western Serbia, a pink and white stone complex sits on a mountaintop overlooking many miles of green valleys. But the soft pastel colours and scenic views of this sprawling memorial belie a history of struggle and sacrifice. The city of Užice, in western Serbia, was the first region to win its independence from World War II-era Nazi occupation. In late 1941 partisans recaptured the city from the Germans, and declared the city and its surroundings the “Republic of Užice”—but it would be short lived. In November 1941, a reinforcement of German troops was sent to reclaim the Užice region; they would succeed, too, though their advance was delayed dramatically by the sacrifice of the local Partisan Worker’s Battalion. On November 29th, the partisan battalion threw themselves in the path of the advancing Germans, heading them off at Kadinjača Mountain. The Germans had a far superior force, and almost every member of the Worker’s Battalion died in that conflict. Their sacrifice, however, bought valuable time with which to evacuate civilians out of Užice before the Germans retook the city. A decade later, a monument was built to commemorate the partisan struggle at Kadinjača Mountain, a white stone obelisk marked with the words “Heroes of Kadinjača.” Later though, as Yugoslavia entered a period of increased monument production, it was decided that the Kadinjača site was worthy of something greater. The new monument did not replace the obelisk, but rather surround it, developing the mountaintop into an expansive memorial park. The idea for the new complex was formed in 1962, but it wasn’t until 1977 that construction of the Kadinjača Memorial Complex began, under designer Miodrag Živković and architect Aleksandar Đokić. After a two-year construction process the monumental park was opened to the public in September 1979, in a ceremony attended by Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito. Today, the Kadinjača Memorial Complex is maintained to an excellent standard.

It was built in the early 1200s, the ornate Roman-styled church was robbed later on in the century only to be reconstructed in 1370 at the behest of Queen Elizabeth of Slavonia, a member of the Hungarian branch of the Capetian house of Anjou. During the reconstruction a gothic tower was added to the church giving it a slightly mixed architectural style. Later on the church fell into the hands of a series of Serbian despots until it was finally burned to near non-existence by the Ottomans in 1551. After this final act of destruction, the church never recovered, but never disappeared either. Today the church sits in Serbian territory and is protected by the state.

20,'Catacombs' of Petrovaradin Fortress,"Petrovaradin, Serbia",A maze of underground tunnels beneath one of the most beautiful forts in Serbia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/catacombs-of-petrovaradin-fortress,"Petrovaradin Fortress lies on the right coast of the Danube river, where the picturesque old town of Petrovaradin meets Serbia’s second largest city of Novi Sad. The fortress, whose construction started in 1692, was an important strategic point throughout history. The strategic importance of the fortress has earned it the nickname “Gibraltar of the Danube.” Though it’s a popular site, most tourists are not aware of the secret underground tunnels hidden beneath the fortress. The underground military galleries—often referred to as the catacombs—create a four-story, roughly 10-mile-long (16 kilometers) network of passageways. There are numerous artifacts and symbols found on the walls, such as the Maltese cross and various masonic symbols. One of them is the ipam miam inscription, used by the alchemists and Freemasons. Each level is marked with a different color, with the fourth (black) one being the most mysterious, as on its bottom lies the so-called “Kaiser Well,” from which the Austrian king Joseph drank water. There are many legends related to the fortress’ tunnels, including a myth about hidden treasure. The story goes that the Austrian Imperial Treasury was brought into the fortress to hide it from the Napoleon’s possible attack on Vienna, and that some of the treasure has still remained hidden underneath.  Entering the underground tunnels without an authorized guide is not advised and can be extremely dangerous. Contact verified local tourist agencies and join an organized tour. Local agencies with trained professional guides provide useful information on what to bring, wear, and how to behave while inside. Entrance in the tunnels is at your own risk. Some areas are in total darkness, therefore bringing a flashlight or a similar source of light is a must.

By dawn, 105 prisoners had escaped in the dark, leaving 11 German guards dead in their wake. It was a seminal moment, and a rare defeat of the otherwise crushing control concentration camp guards had over their prisoners. In Nazi fashion, this daring prison break – unprecedented before or since in World War II-era Europe – was met with a cruel response. The German troops in charge of the camp executed more than 1,100 prisoners to punish and scare the population after the breakout. It was the only breakout over the four years the camp was in operation. Throughout that time, more than 35,000 Serbs and other prisoners passed through the gates of the camp. Like so many, the camp at Niš was positioned near a railway station, making for easy transport of prisoners and the fruits of their forced labor. Today, the Red Cross operates a memorial museum on the grounds of the camp. Its name, the “12. februar” Memorial Museum, commemorates the day fearless prisoners struck back at their captors, at once honoring and avenging the thousands of other prisoners who weren’t so lucky.",crime and punishment memento mori museums and collections

The church and the monks’ cells seem to hang from the rock, though they’re actually built into cliffside caves. The 13th-century Serbian Orthodox monastery is situated in the Crna Reka river canyon.  A narrow wooden footbridge connects the monastery to the earth below. It’s assumed the bridge was once movable, which would have made it nearly impossible to approach or attack the monastery from the ground. Crna Reka Monastery monastery includes a church in a cave, which was dedicated to Archangel Michael and covered with frescoes from the 16th century. The monastery is also home to the holy relics of Saint Peter of Koriša, a famous Serbian hermit who lived in the village near Prizren. Today, numerous pilgrims still come to the monastery to seek healing and spiritual consolidation from this saint. In the 15th century, the sanctuary was home to a famous hesychast named St. Ioanichios.  Crna Reka is located near Ribariće village, just off the Ibar highway 30 kilometers south of Novi Pazar. Frequent buses from Novi Pazar stop at the village.

23,Bač Fortress,"Bač, Serbia",A well preserved medieval fortress in Vojvodina.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bac-fortress,"Located on the outskirts of a small town in northern Serbia, Bač Fortress is the most important medieval monument in the province of Vojvodina. There are records of a fort at the site dating back to at least the 9th century. The fortress originally stood on a historical island on the Mostonga river—back in those days, it was only approachable by drawbridge. The fortress that stands in Bač today was built by the Hungarian king Charles I in the 14th century. The castle complex originally had eight towers, along with residences, a chapel, well, barn, cistern and storage buildings. Bač Fortress changed hands several times, and has been possessed at various points in time by the Kingdom of Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg Monarchy, and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1704, the fortress was badly damaged and largely abandoned. In 1948, Bač Fortress was declared a cultural monument, and a plan was developed to preserve and restore the historic building. During the restoration process, work has focused on preserving archaeological remains and helping visitors appreciate the wider cultural landscape of Bač. The project was awarded the 2018 Europa Nostra Award, the European Union’s prize for cultural heritage. Historically, the town of Bač has been a major crossroad point. Historians say that the region used to be one of the most developed parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. Artifacts found in the region suggest that it has been occupied by humans for nearly 8,000 years. Today, Bač is a unique mosaic of European cultures, containing buildings from the 12th to the 19th centuries with influences ranging from Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Byzantine, and Islamic art.  The fortress is open Monday through Friday from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from noon to 8 p.m. Buses run daily from Novi Sad run to Bač.",fortresses towers castles medieval history architecture

The cave is 1,691 meters (5,548 feet) long and its entrance is located 711 meters (2332 feet) above sea level, near the Prištavica River. The cave consists of five units: the Bright Hall, the Dark Hall, the Great Hall with Tubs, the Tub Canal and the River Canal. Though Stopića Cave is not rich with speleothems—structures like stalactites and stalagmites made from mineral deposits in water—it does have some unique geological features. The cave is home to a number of “siga,” or limestone tubs, of different sizes and depths. They are some of the largest of their kind, with some as deep as seven meters (23 feet). A number of these tubs form a slanted wall from which water constantly overflows. A pathway from the tubs leads deeper inside the cave, eventually reaching a 10-meter (33-foot) underground waterfall known as the Source of Life. The deafening roar of falling water makes it impossible to hear the person talking to you. The cave climate depends of the weather conditions—it is warm in summer and cold in winter. The water from the Trnavski stream, which flows through the cave, contributes to the micro-climate.  Stopića Cave is located about 250 kilometers (150 miles) from Belgrade. The best way to reach the cave from the capital is to take the main road to Montenegro via Zlatibor. Buses run frequently from major cities in Serbia to Zlatibor. Taxi transfer is recommended from Zlatibor to the cave.

Dedicated to the fighters of WWII’s Trstenik’s NOP Detachment and the troops of the Kraljevačkog Detachment, Popina Memorial Park consists of a series of giant stones – some shaped like pyramids, others like smooth arches – all with holes seemingly blasted through their centers. Standing several stories high, the sculptures themselves dwarf the vehicles necessary to reach the site, and a human can easily pass through their centers fully upright. Scattered along a wooded slope, at a certain angle one can align the voids into a tunnel-like configuration, which eerily leads to nowhere. Completed in 1981, the tribute was designed by the famous designer Bogdan Bogdanović. Though his name may not immediately ring a bell, this one man is responsible for some of the most immediately recognizable memorials in Eastern Europe, including Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Partisan Memorial Cemetery, the Stone Flower at Jasenovac, Croatia, and Kosovo’s Mitrovica Miners Monument, to mention a just few. Despite being strikingly minimal in its execution, Popina Memorial Park has a way of sticking with its visitors, even if they know nothing of what once transpired here. On October 13, 1941, a small coterie of troops met in one of the first frontal combat engagements against Germany’s troops. Heavy casualties were incurred. This forgotten memorial at Popina, which ranks among Bogdanović’s forgotten masterpieces, was built to commemorate the losses suffered while defending these hills. Go by car.

The canyon was created by the intrusion of the river flow into the rock mass of the mountain. The layered edges of the rock create an impression of cauldrons and pots, hence the canyon’s nickname. The unusual canyon is about 500 meters (1640 feet) long, and its walls are about 70 meters (230 feet) tall. The walls of the hollowed gorge are made of delicate limestone layers. Limestone shale sediments contain many types of ammonites, extinct marine cephalopods that often had spiral shells. At the bottom of the canyon, the water is rarely warmer than five or six degrees, but due to the steepness of the rocks the icy water is almost impossible to reach. The river creates an imposing series of waterfalls, and the unique scene of the mountain relief represents a true undiscovered treasure for nature lovers. Due to its remote location, the canyon is not visited by many tourists except hikers, mountaineers, and adventure enthusiasts. Around the canyon can be found old Serbian villages, such as Slavinja and Rsovci, which is known for its medieval cave church with a “bald Jesus” fresco.  Rosomaca Canyon is located in the village of Slavinja, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the town of Pirot. It is about a four hour drive from Belgrade. From Slavinja, the path to the canyon is well-marked, and about a 30-minute walk from the village center.",rock formations rivers rocks geological oddities geology

28,'Roman Well' of the Belgrade Fortress,"Belgrade, Serbia","A misnamed well, with a deep dark past.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/roman-well-of-belgrade-fortress,"The ‘Roman Well’ is located in the southwest part of the Upper Town within Kalemegdan fortress, though in truth the well really isn’t Roman, at all. More likely is that it was actually built in the 18th century by the Austrians and that the name could be connected to their ambition to be considered as the inheritors of the great Roman Empire, or as the holders of the title of the Holy Roman Emperor, a confusing title which came after the actual Roman empire and referred to the ruler of the Germanic lands. (There are in fact real Roman wells in Belgrade. One is located below the courtyard of the Russian Embassy in Vracar, and one of the former tram turntable in Zvezdara, and a third in the square between Faculty of Philosophy and Captain Misa building also called Njegos Square.) According to the official story, the well was built during the Austrian reconstruction of the Belgrade Fortress in order to provide water for the army, between 1717 and 1732. Unfortunately, the digging proved to be futile and that might have changed its purpose, the well serving as a dungeon from then on. (Or more specifically it would have been, in French terms an “oubliette,” or “forgotten place,” a hole where prisoners were thrown in and forgotten about.) The well was examined in detail in 1940, at which point the research team determined that it doesn’t connect to the river Sava, but was instead being filled with surface water from the Upper Town. The notoriety of the ‘Roman Well’ comes from the many tales and legends of prisoners being thrown down the hole throughout the Belgrade history. The latest case was surprisingly recent when in 1954 a mentally ill man killed his wife and threw her body down the well.

The monastery was founded by the Serbian medieval ruler Despot Stefan Lazarević in the early 1400s. The massive structure was dedicated to the Holy Trinity and belongs to the Morava architectural style. The monastery complex is surrounded by monumental, mostly rectangular walls used for defense. The walls consisted of 11 towers, with the most prominent being the Despot’s tower. During the early 21st century, a team of archaeologists found the remains of a person believed to be Despot Stefan Lazarević. DNA analysis confirmed that the remains belonged to a son of Tsar Lazar, Stefan’s father, one of the most prominent Serbian rulers during the Middle Ages. However, it could have been Lazarević’s brother, Vuk, who was also buried at the monastery. The monastery was also home to the medieval Resava School Of Transcription, a center for transcribing, translating, and illuminating manuscripts in the Serbian despotate. It was established by Lazarević in 1407. The monastery contained a library of more than 20,000 books, and the canon of this school was followed in a number of monasteries across the Balkans. Since 2015, the monastery and its picturesque surroundings have become the venue for the “Just Out”  festival.

Known as Spitzer Castle, the mansion was built in the late 19th century by Eduard Ede Spitzer, co-owner of the Beočin cement factory. The building is one of the rare examples of the eclectic architecture in Serbia’s northern province of Vojvodina. Spitzer hired the famous architect Imre Steindl, best known for his work on the Hungarian Parliament Building in Budapest, to design and engineer the mansion. The architectural styles of Spitzer Castle include elements of Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Romanesque art. The interior is an example of a classical Hungarian Art Nouveau, including the interesting Zsolnay ceramics fireplace in the mansion’s main hall. At the time it was built, the castle was surrounded by a large park. In 1889, the Spitzer family moved into the castle, and lived there until World War II. They left Beočin around 1941 and moved to Germany. After the war, the castle was nationalized and ownership was given to the state. At various points in time it hosted a school, library, the first Beočin radio station, and a restaurant. All the while, the building was slowly deteriorating. It was used as film set for numerous movies, including the 1970 American war film Kelly’s Heroes, which starred Clint Eastwood. Today, the castle is deserted, surrounded by wires, without doors or windows and a crumbling rooftop. The castle was nicknamed the “ghost house” by locals. Despite the state of the mansion today, many of its elements have been preserved, especially the façades, interior decorations, the bathroom on the floor, as well as the colorful stained glass on the windows. The castle also has one spacious terrace, with a view on the overgrown bushes and numerous decorations in shape of human figures and dragons in the park.  You can reach Beočin via city bus from Novi Sad (line 78, starting from the Novi Sad bus station). From the main street, take the Dunavska Street that continues into Fruškogorska Street.

32,Šumarice Memorial Park,"Kragujevac, Serbia",Abstract monuments express sorrow and resilience at the site of a horrific massacre in Nazi-occupied Serbia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sumarice-memorial-park,"Located roughly 90 miles from the Serbian capital of Belgrade, Šumarice Memorial Park is a scenic memorial garden that marks the location of some of the worst wartime massacres committed in Nazi-occupied Serbia. In 1941, German officers in Serbia ordered the mass execution of civilians as punishment for the actions of local anti-fascist partisan groups. The most horrific single event took place on October 21st that year, with estimates suggesting that anywhere from 3,000 to 7,000 ethnic Serbs were rounded up and shot on this patch of land just outside Kragujevac. Included among the victims were some 300 school children along with their teachers. The location was turned into a memorial park in 1953, and over the years it would be populated with a number of different monuments and memorial ensembles. These monuments took abstract forms, as different artists each made their own approach to expressing feelings of incalculable sorrow, tempered by a resilient theme of optimism. A monument titled “Interrupted Flight,” or “Monument to Shot Students and Teachers,” symbolises the young lives tragically cut short in October 1941. Designed by Miodrag Živković in 1963, it marks the location of the mass graves. The “Stone Sleepers” memorial ensemble is designed to resemble haystacks, in recognition of the local peasants and farmers who were amongst the many victims of these Nazi massacres. Nearby is the “Monument to the People of Croatia,” or “Circles” monument, designed by Vojin Bakić in 1981. It takes the form of a series of silver disks commemorating those ethnic Croats who were amongst the anti-fascists killed in the Kragujevac region. Various other memorial ensembles are scattered around this sprawling city park, but the heart of the memorial complex can be found at the red-brick building of the October 21st Memorial Museum. The museum was built in 1976, providing a place of education to reinforce the abstract symbolism of the assorted monuments around the park. The museum is extremely well managed, with English-speaking guides and a collection of rotating exhibitions. Visitors are shown archive videos, portraits of some of the many victims, and perhaps most movingly, can read through the final words written by those about to executed, in a collection of translated letters that hang on the museum walls.",communist monuments fascism communist architecture war memorial sculpture gardens nazis war history memorials monuments sculptures military art architecture
33,Tabula Traiana,"Ogradina, Serbia",A Roman monument to their own civil engineering prowess.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tabula-traiana,"The secret of the Roman Empire’s military success lay in the meticulous planing that preceded every campaign. A network of roads crisscrossed the empire in order to facilitate the fast and efficient movement of troops. If needed, new roads were built by the Roman engineering corps in regions of planned military actions. The conquest of Dacia, the region covering most of present day Romania, during the reign of Emperor Trajan, represents the high water mark of Roman military might. In order to supply his troops in Dacia, Trajan had a military road constructed. It traversed hard mountainous terrain. In some places, Roman engineers had to carve the road into almost vertical cliffs. Parts of road were constructed on wooden consoles over rivers. Tabula Trajana is a memorial plaque erected to mark the end of road construction. It is located on the Serbian side facing Romania near Ogradina, opposite Decebal’s Head, the tallest stone sculpture in Europe. A translation of the inscription reads: “Emperor Nerva son of the divine Nerva, Nerva Trajan, the Augustus, Germanicus, Pontifex Maximus, invested for the fourth time as Tribune, Father of the Fatherland, Consul for the third time, excavating mountain rocks and using wood beams has made this road.” The Tabula was originally 50 meters lower. The original spot was flooded with the construction of hydroelectric dam in late 1960s and the monument was moved, now just above the waterline.

The memorial complex commemorates the estimated 10,000 Serbs, Roma and Jews who were executed here by fascists between 1941 and 1945, an event sometimes remembered as the “Pančevo Holocaust.” When it was opened in 1981 under the newly united Yugoslavia, the site originally featured a small museum complex, as well as an amphitheater for educational events. Today though, it has gone to ruin. The buildings have fallen to dereliction, while weeds rise in and around the bare amphitheater. The original lighting system, which would have illuminated the monument by night, has long since been removed, while various incidents of vandalism and theft have robbed the memorial complex of plaques and other features. The monument itself remains, however. It is formed from two concrete waves topped with three-ton bronze elements. The design was intended to represent a ploughed field, a deep furrow cut through the earth. It was designed by Nebojša Delja, who had intended to create something that would gain more significance with age; as the bronze rusted, the reddening of the metal would more closely resemble the colour of the earth. The monument’s creators likely never anticipated the complete collapse of Yugoslavia, however, and the subsequent neglect of this memorial site which today stands as a sad shadow of its former self. Between the two concrete components of the main monument, a circular plinth was once topped with a bronze plaque carved with a few lines of poetry. Now long since stripped away, those words, in Serbian, had read: “The stars were in the beginning, The stars will be there at the end, Red will the furrow be.”",concrete communist monuments fascism communist architecture holocaust war memorial nazis war history world war ii memorials monuments abandoned military

A purpose-built museum, its modernist curves and geometric panes of mirrored glass stand in stark contrast to the flat, ploughed fields surrounding it. Designed in 1989 by noted Bosnian architect Ivan Štraus, the interior of the building contains a history of manned flight in Serbia. Impressively laid out inside the circular dome, the collection runs from the early 1900s to the cusp of the 21st century. Of particular interest are a Messerschmitt Bf 109, a Supermarine Spitfire Mk V and an Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik, which were three of the most iconic planes of World War II. More significantly, this is the only museum where those three planes from Germany, Britain, and Russia can be seen sitting side by side all bearing the livery of Yugoslavia–a quirky result of Belgrade’s unique history. There is also a rare Hawker Hurricane. Also notable are displays featuring a selection of NATO aircraft and drones disabled by Serbian air defence forces in the more recent Yugoslav Wars. These include pieces (proudly displayed) of a Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter and a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, both shot down in 1999. Some larger aircraft sit outside in the shadow of the museum, their aging hulks combining with the sheen of the odd glass structure to provide a melancholy picture. The sense of decay is exacerbated by an airplane graveyard consisting of exhibits that evidently did not make the cut and thus lie abandoned and rusting in the lee of the space-age structure. The overall combination of architecture, history, and ruin porn create a peculiar and compelling environment. As the museum is located near the main airport, it is most easily accessible by getting to the airport itself. A good idea is to visit while entering or exiting the country.

The German occupation of Serbia during the Second World War was cruel and bloody. Here in Kruševac alone, an estimated 1,650 civilians and anti-fascist partisans were executed between 1941 and 1944. Taken to Bagdala Hill on the edge of town, where they were hanged and thrown into mass graves. On one single day, June 29, 1943, a total of 324 civilians were murdered here. Attitudes to death and remembrance differ greatly from one region to the next. In many Western cultures our memorials built to the dead are solemn, serious affairs. But in socialist Yugoslavia, there was a trend to commemorate places of death by building public parks, or colourful memorial complexes that encouraged play and relaxation. Designed by Serbian architect Bogdan Bogdanović, the memorial park at Kruševac was opened in 1965 after a five-year construction project. It’s name, “Slobodište,” means “Freedom.” At the entrance to the park, beside the road, a memorial museum featured exhibits dedicated to the victims of the German massacres. Outside of the museum though, the park tells its history through symbolism alone. Visitors pass between two barrows, containing the mass graves themselves. First, they pass through a stone structure titled the “Gate of Death.” Beyond that, they are welcomed into the “Valley of Life.” Here, a grassy hillside is decorated with 12 stone forms in the shape of bird wings. Said to represent the victims’ souls flying up and out of the mass graves, the wings are engraved with cryptic patterns and designs. They are very comfortable to sit in, too, and on a sunny day locals will often be seen reclining in these stone rests. Despite suffering some damage from vandals over the years, the Slobodište Memorial Park is nevertheless well maintained to this day and it survives as an important place of remembrance and a symbol of Serbian resilience.",communist monuments communist architecture war memorial design war history world war ii memorials monuments military architecture

The waterfall is one of the largest in all of Serbia and was formed due to natural sinter (tufa) accumulation. A shallow pond with crystal clear turquoise water forms at the foot of the falls, surrounded by tufa blocks. The amount of water flowing through the waterfall depends on the weather conditions and seasons, with spring being the best time to visit. The falls and the surrounding landscape is protected as an exceptional natural monument by the Republic of Serbia.",waterfalls natural wonders water nature

The Vratna Gates are the largest natural stone bridges in Europe. These three gigantic rocks loom over the swerving forest stream. Two of the stone bridges represent the remains of a former tunnel cave through which the Vratna river once flowed, while the third was created due to river sinkage. The Small and Large Gates are located near the entrance to the gorge, not far from the Vratna monastery, which coined them the “Monastery Gates”. The Small Gate is 49 feet (15 meters) long and more than 100-feet (34 meters) tall, while the Large Gate is 148 feet (45 meters) long and 85 feet (26 meters) tall. The last stone bridge the Dry Gate, is located deeper in the river gorge and is the youngest and the hardest to reach. It garnered its name because the river sinks underneath the gate.

39,Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul,"Postenje, Serbia",The oldest church in Serbia was also the ecclesiastical seat of the region during the Middle Ages.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-of-the-holy-apostles-peter-and-paul,"The Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, commonly known as the Church of St Peter, is one of the oldest churches in the region. The church is located a little over a mile (2 kilometers) north of the city of Novi Pazar on a hill in Ras, the former capital of medieval Serbia. While scientists haven’t been able to pinpoint the exact date the church was founded, evidence suggests it existed as far back as the 4th century. However, it was first mentioned as the seat of the Serbian eparchy sometime around the 9th century The church was constructed on the foundation of several earlier Christian churches. The hillside around the church is an archeological site unto itself, where ancient Greek sculptures and pottery were discovered. The church’s architectural style is reminiscent of churches found in Italy, Armenia, and Georgia that date between the 7th and 9th centuries. The church’s frescoes cover the 10th, 12th and 13th centuries. Stefan Nemanja, the Grand Prince of the Grand Serbian Principality, was baptized inside the church around the early 12th century. His two sons, Stefan Nemanjić and Rastko (later known as Saint Sava,) were also baptized inside the church. After Rastko left Serbia for Mount Athos in Greece around 1192, Stefan Nemanja abdicated his thrown. Three years later his son, Stefan Nemanjić, was crowned inside the church. Despite the fall of the Nemanjić Dynasty and the subsequent Ottoman conquest, the church was not abandoned. It was mentioned throughout historical texts until 1690 and the Great Migration of the Serbs to the north. It was later restored by Archbishop Arsenije IV in 1728. The church is surrounded by a cemetery and tombstones that represent the lives of those who survived during the middle ages. Most of the tombstones are cross-shaped, while the older headstones resemble a crate with a human head contour, along with geometric or floral ornaments on the surface. As part of the larger Medieval Ras complex, the church was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.  The church is part of the Old Ras medieval complex, which includes the nearby monasteries of Sopoćani and Đurđevi Stupovi, as well as the fortress of Old Ras. The city of Novi Pazar is itself an interesting fusion of cultures, as it's a multicultural area of Muslims and Orthodox Christians.",unesco religion churches sacred spaces architecture
40,Čačak Mausoleum of Struggle and Victory,"Čačak, Serbia",This symbol of Yugoslav liberation decorated with 620 carved heads of mythical creatures is now a forlorn relic of another time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cacak-mausoleum-of-struggle-and-victory,"Perched above the city of Čačak in Serbia, a solemn stone structure carved with the heads of mythical creatures remembers the many thousands of people who died here during a local struggle for freedom. The Mausoleum of Struggle and Victory was opened in 1980, after a four-year construction project headed by the celebrated Serbian architect, Bogdan Bogdanović. It sits above the town on the slopes of Jelica Mountain, three stone arches rising together into one 12-meter (65-foot) structure. The Germans occupied Čačak in 1941, as World War II-era Nazi forces swept through the Balkans. They met with resistance, however. In July that year the Čačak Partisan Detachment was created, quickly growing to include hundreds of local rebels. This region saw numerous battles over the coming years, and eventually, Čačak was liberated on December 4, 1944. Freedom came at a cost though, and during the battle for the liberation of Čačak more than 4,600 soldiers and civilians were killed. Like most of the Yugoslav monuments built during these years, the monument at Čačak makes no direct symbolic reference to war. Instead, the three segments of the mausoleum structure are decorated with 620 carved heads of mythical creatures, a possible reference to the ancient civilisations of this region and their prehistoric folkloric traditions. The Mausoleum of Struggle and Victory can also be compared to other Yugoslav sites in that it was formed from separate elements that never touch, and yet together form a single whole. This symbolic theme was popular throughout many of the monuments of the period, and it offered a visual symbol for the union of the six republics that made up Yugoslavia. Nowadays though, that union is destroyed—and the Čačak Mausoleum of Struggle and Victory has suffered, too. Heavily graffitied, the monument currently receives no protection from the local authorities, and survives today as a seemingly unloved relic of another time, sat forlorn upon the slopes of a public park.",communist monuments fascism communist architecture communism war memorial nazis war history world war ii memorials monuments military architecture

Just outside the village there are 20 or so windowless stone structures. Though they look like houses, no one lives there. They exist to make, store, and imbibe the delicious wine the region is famous for. In fact, wine is so important to Rajac, the local cemetery is located not in the settlement where people live, but next to the wine cellar complex outside of town. Indeed many of the burial tombs were made from the stone used for building the cellars, which locals say tells a lot about their relationship with wine. The unmarked and unkempt centuries-old graveyard is itself a unique and beautiful sight, lined with elaborately carved tombstones. Scholars have proposed that the tombstones were made by the Vlachs, the ancient dwellers of the village. Many are covered in ancient pagan symbols like the swastika and kolovrat, though the most interesting combine Christian and pagan symbols. Some of the tombstones are huge, taller than six feet, and a lot of them are shaped in the form of a monolith cross, like the letter “T.” Many are not named and are clearly deteriorating. Some of the newer graves with Cyrillic inscriptions are marked with dates from 19th century, while locals claim the oldest graves date back to the 14th century.

However, one day the water in Sopotnica ran dry. Disappointed by this cruel turn of faith, they decided to move again, but a mythical voice from Jadovnik mountain asked them what would they rather have, water or happiness?

The monastery dates back to the 14th century and is comprised of three different levels. It was also known as one of the most prominent monasteries in the region. The monastery was constructed under the orders of Despot Stefan Lazarević, a medieval Serbian ruler who founded several sacred locations, including the famous fortified monastery of Manasija. The Monastery Blagoveštenje was a difficult place to reach as it was constructed around 65 feet (20 meters) above the Mlava river and into a cliff. Every time the river levels rose, all connections to the monastery were broken. It was also extremely difficult to reach even in the best of conditions due to the treacherous pathways leading to the monastery. During the Middle Ages, the monastery was frequented by numerous monks from across the country. It was an important site for illuminating holy manuscripts and books. It also housed several other manuscripts for visiting monks to study. The monastery was destroyed during the centuries after the Ottomans took control of the country.

It is situated on the banks of Danube river near the Iron Gates gorge and the town of Donji Milanovac in eastern Serbia. The earliest artifacts date to 7000BC. The culture reached its peak in period 6500 BC to 5500 BC. The most remarkable feature of Lepenski Vir site is the complex uniform floor plan which all of uncovered buildings share. While most of human cultures have developed architectural elements based on rectangular or circular layouts, Lepenski Vir buildings have a layout which is based on elaborate geometry of equilateral triangle grid and 60 degree circle sections. It appears that this kind of floor plan was constructed using an intricate compass and straight edge technique, indicating that inhabitants of Lepenski Vir possessed the understanding of geometry seemingly much greater then their hunter-gatherer lifestyle would require. The whole settlement was organized according to same basic underlying pattern and oriented along the riverbank, an obvious focus of attention of inhabitants. Another intriguing aspect of Lepenski Vir culture is its sculptural art.

There’s a plaque for that. On May 7, 1999, five bombs carried by a pair of American B-2 stealth bombers hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during an airstrike organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), killing three Chinese citizens and creating a diplomatic firestorm. U.S. President Bill Clinton apologized, calling it a terrible accident, while the Chinese government denounced the attack as distinctly “barbarian.” At the time, in an atmosphere where a cook and a motor pool worker were drafted as “experts” in scouting targets for NATO’s ill-received 78-day bombing campaign in the former Yugoslavia – which had been billed to the world as a mission to help prevent instability in the region from spreading – the U.S. and international officials agreed that the bombing of China’s totally unrelated embassy was attributable to an error in coordinates due to sources using outdated maps. With such a fishy, flimsy dismissal, doubts lingered about how such an egregious error could have taken place in the modern world. Some of these were validated, only later to be squelched by U.S. sources attesting that the embassy wasn’t nearly so innocent as it purported, functioning as a strategic center transmitting commands to the Yugoslav army. Others have suggested the outpost was charged with retrieving intelligence on America’s stealth aircraft technology after the downing of a F-117. No matter the reason, the effect was the same – three dead, 20 injured, and a gross debacle amidst NATO’s mystifyingly bloody mission to save the lives of the people of Kosovo. Regardless of the impetus, China’s outrage has not settled as quickly as the dust surrounding the embassy’s debris, even if Western media has chosen to selectively forget the event. To this day, the building that once housed the Chinese embassy still stands, though it is completely ruined. In tribute to the lives lost in the bombing, a plaque was installed commemorating the events of the night of May 7, 1999. A translation of the memorial reads: “In gratitude of the People Republic of China’s support and friendship in the Republic of Serbia’s most bitter/difficult time.

The church of St. Peter and Paul in Rsovci is home to “Jesus the Bridegroom,” a depiction of Jesus that is notable for his bald head. There is some disagreement about the origin of this fresco. Some claim that it was painted in the 13th century by an experienced artist who had traveled from Sinai, which is a source of old painting styles and techniques. But many of the inhabitants of the Rsovci village claim that the fresco is the work of the people seeking for God’s help during hard times. The fresco is located on the northern wall of the church, which is itself remarkable. Built inside a cave, the walls have a glassy surface that results from water draining from the church ceiling. Many people believe that the water is healing. Until recently, the church was in disrepair, but recent work has been done to restore the church. Since 1981, the church has been protected as a national cultural heritage site by the Republic of Serbia as a national cultural heritage site.

50,Poslastičarnica sa stavom,"Belgrade, Serbia","This ice cream parlor serves scoops of flavors like rakia, medlar, and poppy seed.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/poslasticarnica-sa-stavom,"When this ice cream parlor opened in 2015, it had a clear mission: to make exceptional frozen treats with a Serbian twist. The shop eschews artificial ingredients, relying solely on locally grown fruits and other regional ingredients for their vibrant colors and flavors. As a result, the ice creams on offer vary depending on the season. The plum, which is the national fruit of Serbia, was selected to be the first flavor produced and sold. Soon, traditional flavors, such as chocolate, cream, and coffee, joined the roster, along with more unusual offerings, including poppy seeds, lavender, and medlar. The menu here consists of a mix of popular staples and more distinctive signature options. The latter category includes boozy numbers such as a rakia ice cream made with 84 grams of the Balkan fruit brandy per kilo and a white wine ice cream with 250 grams of wine per kilo. Since the process for making ice cream does not eliminate alcohol, the possibility of becoming inebriated should not be underestimated. Another signature ice cream flavor that deserves its own category is ajvar. Ajvar is a traditional condiment principally made of mashed, roasted red pepper and eggplants, which makes for an ice cream that’s both savory and sweet. Be sure to sample before ordering the ajvar ice cream, as this unusual combination may not be to everyone’s taste. Poslastičarnica sa stavom also creates custom flavors for special events. Through the years, they’ve tinkered with adding other alcoholic beverages, including red wine and beer, to ice cream. Although the results were intriguing, these novelties never became best-sellers. They were taken off the regular rotation, but are still available on request—provided the order is sufficiently large to justify making a batch. In order to get just the right consistency for each flavor, Poslastičarnica sa stavom uses two different ice cream machines, which explains why some flavors are creamier or more aerated than others. Finally, a word about the cones, which are made in-house from scratch. Quality Serbian butter gives these cones a richer flavor than their commercial counterparts.

Located near Zaječar the complex was built by Emperor Galerius in 298 AD to mark his birthplace. The site was named after his mother, Romula, who was a priestess of a pagan cult. As one of the Tetrarchs, Galerius ruled the empire jointly with three others as either Caesars (junior emperor) or Augusti (senior emperor). The complex of temples and palaces served as a place of worship of Galerius’ mother’s divine personality, a monument to his own deeds as an emperor, and a luxurious villa. Romuliana survived until the 5th century when it was plundered by the Huns. Later the site became a settlement of farmers and craftsmen. It was abandoned at the beginning of the 7th century with the arrival of the Slavs. A strong supporter of the ancient Roman religious structure, Galerius has been blamed for instigating the Diocletianic Persecution, a series of edicts in 303 AD that eliminated the rights of Christians in the Roman Empire and lead to the widespread persecution of Christian followers. At the end of his life in 311 he publicly announced his regret of the policies. The edicts were officially overturned by Constantine’s Edict of Milan in 313. His final act was an attempt to return home to Romuliana, but he died en route. The Roman historian (and Christian) Eusebius described his agonizing death as God’s judgement for his policies. Pursued by a divinely ordained punishment, which began with his flesh and went on to his soul,” a rupturing of his bowels left his physicians “unable to endure the overpowering and extraordinary stench.” After his death, his body was brought to Romuliana for burial. Archaeological excavations on the site revealed the remains of a Roman compound with two temples, two palaces, and a building with corridor including fine mosaics depicting Greek gods Dionysus and Medusa, as well as figural capitals of Hercules, hot baths, basilicas and impressive gates, as well as a collection of Roman gold coins. Other testaments to Galerius’ reign still stand in Thessaloniki, Greece, including the remains of a monumental octopylon (eight-pillared gateway) as well as the Rotunda of Galerius, now the oldest church in Thessaloniki.

The identity of the hero has not been verified, though some documents claim that in the grave rests a 70-year-old Muslim man from the Pešter Highlands who was killed by an enemy grenade in 1915. After members of the Allied Forces began building similar monuments, King Alexander I decided to construct a similar structure in Serbia. To make room for the Serbian monument, the medieval fortifications atop the hill were destroyed. The grave’s architectural design resembles an ancient temple and includes a sarcophagus made of black granite. It’s surrounded by caryatids representing the people of former Yugoslavia: Bosnian, Montenegrin, Dalmatian, Croatian, Slovenian, Vojvodina’s, Serbian, and Old Serbian women. The inscription at the top of the sarcophagus reads, “Alexander I King of Yugoslavia to the Unknown Hero.” The tomb with the remains of the unknown hero is located in the crypt, underneath the monument. The monument instantly caused some controversy, as people believed the unknown hero who fought and died for the Kingdom of Serbia was used to propagate an idea of a unified Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The area soon became a popular picnic area and a memorial complex.

It’s located north of the city of Ras, a medieval capital of Serbia located on the slopes of Mount Golija in the Ibar river valley. This area is known as the “Serbian Valley of Kings” as many emperors and rulers constructed their monasteries throughout the region. The monastery’s name derives from a Byzantine fort from the 6th century that included an early-Christian church. The foundations of that church are still visible at the monastery. Inside the complex are two churches, the Church of the Entry of the Most Holy Theotokos into the Temple and Church of St Nicholas. The larger church was the burial place of Helen, until Ottoman raids forced the monks to flee with her sarcophagus. It has been missing ever since. According to Archbishop Danilo, the queen chose the best artists to construct the monastery. The Church of the Entry of the Most Holy Theotokos into the Temple highly resembles sacral buildings of central and southern Italy. This has led many to believe that the builders came from the Adriatic coast. The monastery church represents the fusion of western European culture and art that represented the queen’s heritage. It’s believed she was of French or Italian descent. With the traditional forms of the Raška architectural school, several Romanesque and Gothic architectural features are skillfully connected. The most visible among them are the windows, arcades, and rooftop decorations, all of which make it unique among Serbian medieval temples. Gradac Monastery was founded as a friary and hosted a number of monks during the 14th century. It was devastated and renewed multiple times over its history. Nowadays, it’s a nunnery.

The fresco depicts an angel wearing white robes, sitting on a stone and showing the myrrh-bearers the empty tomb of Christ—the place of his resurrection. The angel’s enigmatic facial expression is often compared to that of Mona Lisa, gazing straight into the observer’s eyes. It is a part of a larger work called “Mironosnice na Hristovom grobu” (“Myrrh-bearers on Christ’s Grave”), which is the work of an unknown artist. It was painted over in the 16th century, and remained hidden from the public eye for the next four centuries. As that paint started to wear away, the original fresco was discovered underneath. In 1963, the fresco was sent as a message in the first satellite broadcast signal from Europe to America in 1963. The same signal was later sent to space, as an attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial life forms, as a universal symbol of peace, along with photos of the Great Wall of China and man’s first steps on the moon, as well as recordings of whale song. The monastery of Mileševa is located on the Mileševica River near the town of Prijepolje in southwestern Serbia. Built in Raška medieval architectural style by the Serbian king Stefan Vladislav, it is considered one of the most important places in the Serbian Orthodox Church.

56,Stjepan Filipović Monument,"Valjevo, Serbia",A tribute to a man who defied the Nazis until his last breath.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stevan-filipovic-monument,"Stjepan Filipvić was only 26 years old when the Nazis hanged him. On May 27, 1942, the Yugoslav communist stood on the gallows in Valjevo, rope around his neck, and threw his fists in the air and shouted out his last words to the onlookers: “Smrt fašizmu, sloboda narodu!” (“Death to fascism, freedom to the people!”). Filipvić joined the laborer’s movement in 1937. He spent a year in jail for his association with the anti-fascist group, but his conviction remained. He joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1940, and by ‘41 he’d been made commander of the Partisans’ Tamnavsko-Kolubarski unit in Valjevo. He was captured by the Axis forces in 1942 and sentenced to death. But even in the moments leading to his death, he resisted the Nazi occupation, urging the Yugoslav people to fight for their freedom. Slobodanka Vasić, a 17-year-old girl who worked in a local photography studio, took photos of the hanging. As news of the photo spread and large numbers came to see it, Nazi occupiers became suspicious of her intentions. Vasić was jailed and her images of the execution were confiscated. They may have been lost if it weren’t for the quick thinking of Branko Kesler, a local doctor who worked for the partisan resistance. He was trusted by the Nazis, who allowed him to see the photos. When no one was looking he slipped Vasić’s now-iconic image under a rug. Stjepan Filipović was declared a National Hero of Yugoslavia in 1949, and in 1960, a 52-foot statue was erected in his honor. Sculptor Vojin Bakic’s monument to the young communist stands in the same defiant pose in the same city where he was killed.

The building was constructed in 1894 by Leon Štegervald. However, it was later purchased by surveyor Paja Pin, hence the building’s namesake Pinova Vila (Pin’s Palace). Various elements of Romantic period architecture is still visible from the outside, although the palace now sits in ruins and on the verge of collapsing. This has earned the building the moniker “the museum of destruction.” Pinova Vila eventually became a symbol of the lack of interest by Serbian authorities to preserve some of the country’s historic ruins. In 2005, the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of Zrenjanin created a plan to renovate Pinova Villa, however, 15 years later, Pinova Vila remains dilapidated and in a state of ruins.

The village is home to a geothermal spa that takes on a unique hue. The spa is better known as the Pink Lake. The lake is small, only about 2,000 square meters, virtually the size of two Olympic-style swimming pools. However, people travel from across the country to experience the healing properties of the lake, which is filled with minerals such as sodium, iodine, sulfates, and bromine to name a few. The temperature of the water is around 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius), although the spring water is actually 161 degrees Fahrenheit (72 degrees Celsius), it’s cooled down for safety. Because of the high temperature, visitors are suggested to only spend around 20-30 minutes in the water. It’s still somewhat a mystery as to how the lake garnered its unique pink color, but it’s assumed that the various minerals, temperature, and sunlight combine to create this natural wonder. The lake has become a popular destination during summers in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.

Viminacium was the capital of the Roman province of Moesia and an important military camp, founded around the 1st century. The city thrived throughout the centuries, eventually gaining the status of a colony during the reign of emperor Gordian III. It’s estimated that the city was home to 48,000 inhabitants. Two Roman legions were stationed here, Legion VII and Legion IV. In 382, Viminacium was the meeting place for Theodosius and Gratian during the Gothic Wars. It was destroyed in 441 by Attila the Hun, but rebuilt by Justinian I. The first excavations at the site occurred in 1882. The remains of over 14,000 tombs were found at Viminacium, complete with antique frescoes inside. Ruins of an amphitheater, buildings, a Roman thermae, an aqueduct, mausoleum, and parts of a sewer system were discovered along with pottery shards and coins. They all provide a vision of what life was like this once vibrant Roman city. The tombstones and sarcophagi are decorated with relief representations of mythological scenes. The most prominent image is the “Divina,” a fresco of a beautiful, young woman that somewhat resembles the “Mona Lisa”. It’s the centerpiece of one tomb and probably represents a woman who was buried inside. In June 2012 during the excavation, an amphitheater was discovered, one of the largest in the Balkans. The excavation also revealed a gladiator arena that contained the remains of wild animals. Also found at the Viminacium archeological site is the Mammoth park, where a prehistoric mammoth skeleton was unearthed along the outskirts of the imperial mausoleum. The skeleton is believed to have come from the Miocene era.  Most artifacts excavated at the site are on display at the National Museum in Belgrade and National Museum in Požarevac.",roman ancient archaeology architecture

The inside is graffitied, plants are colonizing the roof, and the walls are deteriorating. The building has been similarly neglected in terms of scholarly documentation, so little is known about its origins. But it is believed to have been built in the late 1800s—in German, Neo-Romanesque style—as a water tower and guard tower for the castle.

Known as the Latin Church, the building got the name from Dubrovnik merchants (called “Latins” by the locals for their Catholic faith) who used it for religious ceremonies in the 16th century. It is one of the few buildings from the pre-Nemanjić dynasty epoch (Medieval Serbia), when the region was still part of the Byzantine Empire. The church was built from stone and bricks and the facade decorated with stone ornaments. There are no traces of interior decorations and frescoes remaining, but it is known it was painted in 1870, including with a fescoe depicting a life-size figure of famous Serbian medieval knight Miloš Obilić. The architectural style of the church resembles the old Byzantine churches: stone, with brick arcades and one ancient Roman tombstone embedded in the wall. The churchyard is a necropolis of the prominent Dubrovnik merchants and diplomats from that time. During the Ottoman conquest, it was the only remaining church in the area, as all others were converted into mosques.

63,Studenica Monastery,"Brezova, Serbia","This beautiful medieval Serbian monastery is home to frescoes, peculiar sculptures, and historical curiosities.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/studenica-monastery,"The Studenica Monastery is considered the most beautiful example of Serbian medieval ecclesiastical architecture. For over eight centuries, the monastery survived numerous conquests and still houses some of the most amazing examples of medieval frescoes and treasures. The monastery was established during the late 12th-century by Stefan Nemanja, the founder of the medieval Serbian state and the famous Nemanjić dynasty. It’s the largest and richest Serbian Orthodox monastery and earned a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1986. The monastery is located in the “Valley of the Kings,” along with the Žiča, Gradac, Sopoćani, and Djurdjevi Stupovi monasteries. All are considered major religious and cultural sites from the Middle Ages. Located within the complex is the Church of the Virgin, the Church of St. Nicholas, and the King’s Church, as well as other facilities such as the monastery’s lodgings, the bell tower, and the museum. The Church of the Virgin is a domed basilica, whose facades were constructed with white marble slabs. Inside, the church is revetted with tuff blocks. Externally, it reconciles two architectural styles, the Romanesque and the Byzantine, a mix that later produced a particular Raška style common for most monasteries in medieval Serbia. The King’s Church was named after Serbian king Milutin. Constructed in 1314, the church is dedicated to the saints Joachim and Anna. Fragments of frescoes can be found in the bell tower and the external part of the nartex, the most prominent being the Nemanjić dynasty genealogy fresco. Many visitors come to see the famous “Crucifixion of Christ” fresco, also known as the “Studenica Crucifixion,” painted around 1208 with the Byzantine-blue color. At the time, the pigment was considered to be more valuable than gold. The Studenica Cross is carved on the monastery walls and represents the blend of the two symbols—the anchor, representing salvation and security, and the flowers, representing growth and progress. The cross later became the emblem of the construction and culture of medieval Serbia. Other curiosities around the monastery includes the rosettes denoting the Divine Eye, medallions, and fantastic animal carvings that grace the church’s walls. One includes the Studenica Eagle that represents Nemanja, who freed the Serbian nation from turmoil and rose the Kingdom of Christ. The monastery was devastated throughout history due to natural disasters such as fires and earthquakes. Its treasures were often targeted by robbers, especially during the Ottoman conquests. Some of the reliquaries are still preserved and include ancient manuscripts, books, charters, and most notably, the Four Gospels, decorated with colorful headers and initials. There is also a 14th-century shroud of Anthony of Heraclius. Along the southern portal of the Church of the Virgin stands the oldest clock in Serbia; a sundial whose shadow falls on letters instead of numbers, as the Old Church Slavonic language didn’t have symbols that represented numbers. The monastery is located in a peaceful and serene nature preserve, along the slopes of Mt. Golija. Near the monastery flows the Studenica river and other tourist attractions are nearby. These include the Tree of Love, two beech trees whose branches merge into one. Many couples visit and pass under the joint branch, believing it strengthens their love. Another famous site is the unusual Middle Earth-like cave-complex known as the Hermitage of Saint Sava, which offers beautiful views of the valleys and forests.

65,Igrali Se Konji Vrani (Black Horses at Play),"Belgrade, Serbia",The unusual sculptures are believed to be powerful political symbols.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/konji-vrani,"Sculptures featuring some combination of horses and human figures are a common sight in many the European cities. But the pair situated in front of the stairs of National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia is quite unique. The sculpture ensemble, known as Igrali se Konji Vrani, (Black Horses at Play), depicts two muscular male characters being crushed under the hooves of two rampant stallions. They are the work of well-known local sculptor Toma Rosandić and are considered his masterpiece. The artist never gave an official interpretation of his work’s symbolism beyond a simple statement that it represents an artistic exploration of the sculptural forms of human and animal bodies at interplay. Not surprisingly, this academic of explanation didn’t stop the general public from speculating. Public consensus about the meaning of the sculptures seems to be that they represent common men, naked in front of power and being ridden and crushed by overbearing authority. Even further, some people tend to interpret that the position of one of the human figures who bears the horse on his hunched back is an allegory of oppression and that the position of the other figure who faces the horse is a symbol of resistance. The artwork’s timing is key to people’s theories. The sculptures were erected in 1938. They were commissioned by the government of former Kingdom of Yugoslavia to decorate the square in front of the newly completed parliament building. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia, created out of turmoil from World War I, was at that time only 20 years old. It was the first incarnation of a common state that would comprise a set of neighboring countries, now known as Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Montenegro. The authorities of the ambitious young state focused their attention upon their swanky new home at the national assembly. But decorating the space out front was merely an afterthought. The team managing the project had the initial idea of decorating the square with a pair of lion figures. But someone with at least a degree of common sense protested that Yugoslav lands are not known for their lion population, and that a set of figures with horses might be more fitting to the national character. Rosandić was a fitting artist for the job. Though born in Split, Croatia, he spent most of his working life in Belgrade Serbia and he was a Yugoslav in the true sense of the word. By the 1930s, he was already an established artist and well-known figure in Belgrade artistic circles. So when asked to provide a pair of sculptures representing figures of humans and horses befitting the national character he was all too happy to oblige. He kept his work away from the public eye until the date of official unveiling, much to the amazement and delight of the people.  You can walk by the sculptures at any time.",horses sculptures statues

Now, when you enter the empty factory buildings and gritty courtyards, you’re more likely to hear a rock concert or techno music and thousands of cheering fans. Founded in the mid 1800s, the complex, also known as Military Technical Institute, was overseen by a French engineer. At the time, Serbia sought friendly relations with France, and to emulate the country’s economic development. The facilities made the city of Kragujevac a center for weapons (starting with cannons), industry, and, later, automobiles. And while it has fallen into decay, the government has plans to preserve the site in recognition of its importance to the area and Serbia’s industrial revolution. In the meantime, the ruins are a draw for people shooting music videos and TV shows, graffiti artists, and concert promoters. The site is best known for Arsenal Fest, a multi-stage music festival held annually each summer. (Although couples have been known to take wedding photos at Knežev Arsenal as well.) Every year, local authorities organize a clean up of the complex, but due to its lack of security, it quickly returns to the dirty condition that makes it beloved by people who appreciate ruins.

Locals often call it pijani sat (drunk clock), because its accuracy fluctuates depending on the season. The clock consists of three interconnected systems: the timing mechanism that keeps time and powers the clock hands, a striking mechanism that sounds the quarter-hours, and another striking mechanism that sounds the full hours. The timing mechanism is sensitive to changes in temperature. When the weather is cold, the clock tends to run a few minutes behind; When it’s hot, the clock tends to run a few minutes ahead. Petrovaradin Fortress was built from 1692 to 1780, and the clock tower dates to around 1750. The baroque tower has black dials, one on each side of the tower. Its hands are the opposite of most clocks—the hour hand is longer while the minute hand is shorter. It was made like this so that sailors on the nearby Danube river could easily see the time from a distance. The numbers on the dial are Romans and their diameter is greater than two meters. The army took care of the clock for almost two and a half centuries, but since 1952, the military fortification has been left to civilian management.

Recognizing the potential of alternating current in providing reliable electricity, the Leskovac Electric Society formed in 1901. With their eyes trained on the powerful Vucjanka River, the group brought together 150 stockholders to raise capital to finance the building of the Vucje hydroelectric plant. Djordje Stanojevic, a friend of Nikola Tesla, was intimately involved in the project, which is considered responsible for making the Serbian capital one of the first capitals in Europe to be illuminated by hydroelectric power.

A continent away, on a grassy hill overlooking the small town of Rudnik, Serbia, there is a nearly identical sign. Only on close inspection does one notice the differences: The Serbian sign has just one “l,” and reads in full “Serbian Holywood,” although “Serbian” appears in much smaller font. The creation of local artist Ivan Jakovljević, also known as Ivo Tsar, the sign was an effort to draw attention to the town, as it can be seen from the highway, while also expression his disillusionment with Hollywood’s focus on money over artistry. The sign is surrounded by a swing, various sculptures and artworks, and a grassy field that is, once a year, the site of an open-air film festival featuring independent films both professional and amateur.  The film festival generally takes place over several days in late July or early August. See the website for details.",film

Inside the park is a sports center with the same name, and next to the main entrance is a small dog monument with a great background story. Years ago, a circus came to Belgrade. Tents were set in Šumice park and children were invited to the event. One of the main circus attractions was a tiger, but the wild animal somehow managed to escape from its cage and started running at a child in the audience. An English Cocker Spaniel saw the threatening situation and attacked the tiger, trying to save the endangered child. He was saved, and the tiger was captured, but the fight was fatal for the dog. Veterinarians did their best, but the little hero passed away. Grateful citizens decided to build a monument inside the park to honor his memory.  The park is located between Ustanička, Vojvode Toze and Grčića Milenka streets in Belgrade and the monument is next to the Šumice sport center main entrance.",dogs monuments history & culture
80,Orava Castle,"Oravský Podzámok, Slovakia","The 700-year-old fortress was the site of Count Orlok's castle in ""Nosferatu.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/orava-castle,"Orava Castle is an eerie and majestic place, built high up on a rocky cliff over the winding Orava river. It is one of the most beautiful and well-preserved medieval castles in Slovakia, dating back to the 13th century. Its long history starts as a military barracks built after a Mongol invasion to defend what was then the Kingdom of Hungary. Seven centuries later it still stands, now an elaborate neo-Gothic castle that holds many unique myths and legends. Notably, the striking exterior was used as the filming location for Count Orlok’s Transylvanian castle in the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, a claim to fame that adds to its haunting appeal. Inside, a tour of the castle museum takes visitors through the knights’ room, paintings gallery, weapons room, and a collection of many scientific and archaeological artifacts. Price of admission is about 8 euros per person, if you like to take photos on your tour it will cost an extra 3 euros. Special group rates are available.

82,Ruins of Cachtice Castle,"Čachtice, Slovakia",The blood-soaked ruins of the castle where the murderous Blood Countess was walled in alive.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-cachtice-castle,"The site of one of the most sensational - and sensationalized - serial murders in history, Hrad Cachtice stands now empty and mostly ruined. In 1611 the household of the Hungarian countess Elizabeth Bathory was accused of torturing and killing as many as 600 young women within the walls of this castle. Over time, the story began to include accusations of sexual attacks and turned Elizabeth into a aging beauty obsessed by the idea of eternal youth found in the blood of virgins. Now perhaps irretrievably mired in myth and speculation, it may be impossible to completely separate fact from fiction. This much we know: Elizabeth was real, and died here. She was part of the powerful Hungarian Bathory family, and something went very wrong here in the early 1600s. She was married in 1575, as part of an arranged marriage at the age of 14 and received the Cachtice castle property, along with the surrounding feifdom of 17 villages as a wedding gift from her husband. The castle itself dates to at least 1276, when it was mentioned as a border protection fortress. In the early years, they seemed to be more or less a normal aristocratic family - he fought in battles far from home, she hung around the various family properties and eventually bore three children. Although there were a few strange accusations in the early 1600s, things did not get really weird until after her husband’s death in 1604, when she permanently moved to the castle property. Allegedly the routine (yet brutal) punishments of servants escalated into torture and death for minor infractions. A taste for violence led Elizabeth to send her loyal staff into the surrounding villages and countryside to lure young women to the castle, where they often met with grisly ends. When the locals started to wise up and refuse to let their daughters and sisters go to work at the castle, Elizabeth hit on a genius idea: in 1609 she opened a school for lady’s etiquette, then known as a Gynaecaeum. Young women from far-flung noble families began to arrive to receive instruction in the womanly arts from the aging widow. But it was this decision to become involved with noble families that was her downfall, as young ladies went missing, their angry fathers and brothers began to notice strange goings-on at the Castle Cachtice. In 1610, her castle was visited by local authorities, who reportedly discovered injured and dead young women on the property. Her three loyal collaborators were immediately seized and imprisoned. After what has been described as a show trial, the two female collaborators were executed in 1611, their fingertips pulled off with pincers before they were thrown alive into a fiery pit, which shows that the standards of the times were not so far off from Elizabeth’s own predilections. The male servant was beheaded and then thrown into a pit. There is speculation that the force of the trial may have been amplified for political reasons, with opportunists taking advantage of the opening to seize property and wealth from the Bathory clan, particularly since Elizabeth stood alone as a widow. The records also seem to indicate that Elizabeth was not specifically named herself as the perpetrator of the crimes, instead her household was implicated, perhaps out of deference to her status, and the possible embarrassment it would cause to other members of the nobility who had consorted with her. Elizabeth was placed under house arrest, walled in a tower of the castle, while the trial of her servants commenced. She remained there in isolation for four years, fed through a slot in the wall, until she was found dead in 1614. She was originally buried in the local cemetery, but due to local distaste, she was moved to her family home in Ecsed, Hungary. In the following centuries her story was alternately forgotten, and then sensationalized. Speculation has turned her into a lesbian vampire tyrant who sought eternal youth through the blood of virgins, but the truth seems to be gory enough without the supernatural trappings. The castle was abandoned in 1708, and is now in ruins. Visitors can hike up to the ruins from the town of Cachtice, where there is also a small museum in the main square, and the church where her body was originally interred.  There is a motorised bus-train that runs a limited round-trip service from the parking lot up the hill to the castle. A small fee is charged. The walk up is a steady climb of about 15-20 minutes. The grade is is on loose gravel and uneven surfaces, as is the grounds of the castle. Those with mobility issues may want to be advised to use caution and care.",castles ruins
83,Painted Village of Čičmany,"Čičmany, Slovakia",A perfectly preserved hill village where the buildings are painted like white lace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/painted-village-of-cicmany,"The tiny village of Čičmany (population 204) looks just like it did hundreds of years ago, untouched by time. But this is no ordinary preservation area. The village is full of black timber houses, each one decorated with intricate traditional patterns in white lime paint. Literally street after street is lined with folk art. Although the records of the village at Čičmany date back to the 13th century, covering the houses in lacy, geometric and stylized patterns is a much later tradition. It began around 200 years ago, when white lime would be used to help preserve damaged wood. The image of the bright lime pigment on the dark wood was striking, and people began elaborating on themes, eventually covering most of the timber-frame structures with remarkably uniform designs. The buildings that line the little streets today are actually even more modern, although in the traditional folk architecture. In 1921 a fire raced through the village, and many structures had to be restored. With the help of the Slovakian government, funds were made available to keep Čičmany as it had been for centuries. It was established in 1977 as the world’s first folk architecture reserve, ensuring the protection of its buildings, and unique cultural heritage. Čičmany is in northwestern Slovakia, about a two-hour drive from Bratislava. It is possible to reach Čičmany by public transport. The easiest way is to take a bus from Žilina to Rajec, and from there, another bus to Čičmany. However, there are very few buses passing through Čičmany. Visitors stranded in Čičmany can take advantage of the traditional houses turned into penzions (B&B). In addition to the preservation of the structures, the village Považie Museum works to also keep up traditions of festivals, local folk music and art, costume and folk dances. The village is also popular ski destination (Ski center Javorinka). Čičmany is within easy reach by car from Prievidza/Bojnice (known for its spa and picturesque medieval castle) and makes a nice day trip combined with visit of beautifully carved wooden Slovak Betlehem in Rajecká Lesná.",preservation villages art architecture
84,UFO of Bratislava,"Bratislava, Slovakia",This spaceship sculpture in the middle of the Slovakian capital looks like it just crash-landed.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ufo-of-bratislava,"There is a large housing settlement on the east side of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. It’s comprised of three tight circles of low-rise towers from the Soviet era, both in their vintage and their design. In the middle of the center circle is a park—harboring a UFO. The area is called Medzijarky, and was built in the mid-1970s when Slovakia was still half of Czechoslovakia, and all of Czechoslovakia was part of the Soviet bloc. The UFO sculpture at its center was erected at the time of construction, created by local artist Juraj Hovorka. It’s big—15 feet tall and 26 feet across—so big that kids originally were able to crawl inside and play Star Trek (if only Czechoslovakian TV had Star Trek). A well-known and well-schooled sculptor, Hovorka actually lived in one of the Medzijarky towers. His work tended towards what might be called “monumental realism,” which could also describe his UFO—“realism” for an alien spacecraft that is. The name Medzijarky translates roughly as “between the ditches” in Slovakian, and the neighborhood was built during the period of communist rule over the joint state. The years following the country’s split saw the project fall into disrepair and neglect, and that included the quirky UFO. Eventually plans were made to revitalize and update the housing, and the city wanted to take the sculpture down. But the neighbors stood in defense of their spaceship, and lobbied successfully to keep it. The Medzijarky UFO is actually the second most famous UFO in Bratislava. There is one that tops the downtown bridge over the Danube, and it’s become a kind of symbol of for the city. It rises 27 stories over the water, and hosts a sky-scraping destination restaurant. The bridge UFO may be better known, but this one, although it no longer allows the human children inside, looks more like the real thing. Bratislava is the capital of Slovakia and is in the far west along the Danube River, near the borders of both Austria and Hungary. The UFO is in Medzijarky Park, which is encircled by low-rise housing towers and shops. It's about 6km (4 miles) east from from the center of the city.",ufos soviet architecture parks sculptures

86,Sokolia Dolina Gorge,"Hrabušice, Slovakia",Climb around the high waterfalls on series of iron ladders and bridges within the wildest gorge in the Slovak Paradise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sokolia-dolina-gorge,"The Sokolia dolina gorge is the hidden gem of the Slovak Paradise National Park, a beautiful wilderness dotted with wonderful waterfalls, the tallest of which reaches nearly 250 feet (75 meters) high. There are several other trails in the aptly named Slovak Paradise that are considered highlights of the park— such as Suchá Belá, via ferrata Kyse, or Prielom Hornádu—but on this maybe even more beautiful hike you will meet only a few tourists, even in the high summer season. The trail leads through a spectacular, almost untouched forest environment. If you’re lucky you might encounter some wild animals such as deer, chamois, or even lynx. But the top attraction of the trail are surely the waterfalls. There are several, equipped with wooden and iron ladders and bridges you can use to climb around the falls. The highest of them, Závojový waterfall, is a real test of your courage, which is rewarded with a beautiful view from the top. The best time to visit the gorge is in spring and autumn, after rainy days, when the waterfalls have a really large flow. If you need any other information before you start the hike, visit the tourist information centre in Čingov or write an e-mail on info@raj-spis.sk. The easiest access to the trail is from tourist centre Čingov, near the town of Spišská Nová Ves. The whole round hike with start and finish in Čingov may take you about 6 hours, so it is good to start in the morning. The trail through the gorge is passable just one way (from the bottom to the top), so you have to return by another trail. But don't worry, all the trails are well marked so that you will hardly get lost there. You don't need to take any special equipment with yourself, just your hiking boots and a waterproof jacket.",hiking waterfalls national parks water nature

Its colorful astrolabe is the star feature of a building that seems to flow as fluidly as time itself. The clock was built in 2009 during renovations on the town square. It’s the only horologe of its kind in Slovakia. Because its satellite-controlled software allows it to display true solar time, it’s also said to be the most accurate astronomical clock in the world. The timepiece is aesthetically astounding. Its face shows the movements of the celestial world. On its astrolabe, the moon chases the sun on an endless journey through the zodiacs. The clock also translates the way humans interpret these constant astronomical shifts, labeling not only the minutes and hours but also the days and months. A golden arrow strikes each day’s date. Its building, too, is also a sight to behold. The structure ripples and folds around the clock tower, forming the shape of a seated woman in billowing clothes that’s meant to resemble the Virgin Mary. Bronze busts of historic Slovakian figures are perched within nearby niches. An hourly parade of small statues representing Slovakian saints occurs during the day, set to a soundtrack of the tower’s tolling bells.",astronomical clocks time clocks christianity architecture

Is he resting? Is he heading down to clean up your mess? Is he just lurking? Debate rages on as to what this cheeky chap is actually doing as he pokes out of a sculptural manhole in Bratislava’s old town district. The odd statue was installed in 1997 as part of an effort to spice up the look and feel of the area, which was traditionally marked with drab, Communist-era architecture and decoration. As Cumil is leaning out over a curb it comes as no surprise that his head has been clipped off more than once by careless motorists. The statue isn’t just a danger to drivers, but to pedestrians, too. Woe betide the drunkard stumbling their way home in the dark; he’ll have you on the ground if you’re not paying attention. In order to protect drivers, amblers, and— most importantly—Cumil himself, the city installed a warning sign just above his head. Physical dangers aside, Cumil has come to be a beloved institution in the city, and visitors come from all over to lay in the street and look him in the eyes, or just sit on his head.

90,Bratislava’s Hidden Bunkers,"Bratislava, Slovakia",A line of disused military bunkers built to defend against Nazi invasion lies hidden on the outskirts of the city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bratislava-s-hidden-bunkers,"In Petržalka, the very edge of the city of Bratislava on the western bank of the Danube, sits a string of concrete bunkers scattered across a variety of fields and woods. These are the best-preserved remnants of an expensive border defense system that was constructed throughout the country over 80 years ago. In the 1930s, what was then Czechoslovakia invested in a line of military fortifications to defend against invasion by Nazi Germany, which by 1938 following the annexation of Austria (Anschluss), also threatened Bratislava, which sits on the Danube mere miles from the Austrian border. At the time of building the bunkers were state of the art, but ultimately proved of little use. Under the Munich Agreement brokered between Britain, France, and Germany, Czechoslovakia was forced to give up most of its borderlands, including the bunkers. This left the country with a new, poorly defended border and soon afterward the entirety of what was Czechoslovakia fell under Nazi control. There are 14 surviving bunkers along the stretch of border. The largest and best preserved is BS-8, which is maintained as a museum by a team of dedicated volunteers. If you are lucky or make advance contact, they will give tours allowing you access inside the restored bunker. BS-8 is located next to a small World War I cemetery and a slightly incongruous picnic area and playground. Other smaller bunkers, BS-9, and BS-7 can also be found nearby. Standing at BS-8 you can see a nearby road across a field; this road is where the border with Austria lies. Standing at the bunker looking across the perfectly flat fields, you get a sense of the vulnerability the young nation that created these bunkers must have felt.  There are tours to the bunkers but they are also accessible by public transport or walking. Finding the bunkers is not always straightforward though, and it helps to have access to a phone or other device with GPS-enabled maps. Most of the bunkers are marked on Google Maps or the map on the Bunker BS-8 website. BS-8 (and nearby BS-9 and BS-7) are probably the easiest to get to and, for energetic visitors are a good starting point to work your way back to the city along the string of fortifications. To get to BS-8 take the number 80 bus from Zochova stop near the old town and travel for 7 stops to Kopčianska street. Once you get off, walk further down Kopčianska street until you see the signs on the right that say ""bunker."" Do not take the advice of Google Maps in taking other buses such as the 91 or 191 and following alternative walking paths routes. They may not look it, but they are significantly more convoluted once you get off the bus. BS-8 can also be accessed by car directly from the Austrian side of the border.",bunkers nazis underground military history war history world war ii military museums

During the conflict, the mansion was used by Nazi SS officers. The park around the mansion contains meandering paths dotted with sculptures and monuments, with at least one from the communist era. A decaying wall with entry gates borders the property. There is also a courtyard that has became a local haunt for graffiti artists.  The mansion is on the edge of Rusovsky Park (which is the closest address recognized by Google Maps).

Completed in 1972, this cable-supported bridge is the longest single-pylon suspension bridge in the world, and has likely undergone more name changes than any other bridge as well. Originally christened, the “Most SNP” in honor of a 1944 resistance movement against Nazi forces, the bridge was soon known almost universally as the “UFO bridge” due to the circular restaurant, which was originally destined to be an observation platform, that was built atop its single set of pylons. Recognizing the overall dismissal of the bridge’s original name, the city changed the name to “Novy Most,” or “New Bridge” in order to incorporate popular sentiment. Unsurprisingly, many citizens were not pleased with this change and voted to change the name of the bridge back to, “Most SNP” in 2012. Despite the near constant name-changing, the Most SNP and its UFO Restaurant (the eatery’s official name now) still draw visitors from all over the world interested in the unique engineering as much as the scenic view.",aliens bridges restaurants shops

Like the majority of Banska Stiavnica, the calvary is situated on a hill, what with the town being built in the middle of a caldera formed by the collapse of an ancient volcano. A town of great historical significance and a UNESCO World Heritage Site itself, its calvary of three churches, 22 chapels, and statuary of the Virgin Mary is the main draw for tourists. Constructed in the mid-1700s by local Jesuits, it was an epicenter of religious life for 200 years. Through a mixture of architecture, sculpture, wooden reliefs, and painting, it depicts the Passion of the Christ. Despite being built in the middle of the Baroque era, it is not overly grandiose, meaning its worshippers can focus on the spiritual aspects of the Passion. Another unique feature is its arrangement: rather than the standard 14 stations, it has 17, beginning in Nazareth rather than the condemnation of Christ. It is also claimed that several people have been physically healed on the site. Recent years have not been kind to the calvary, however. It suffered major damage during World War II and has also been the victim of neglect, vandalism, and time itself. There is hope for its restoration though. In 2007, it was added onto the list of the World Monument’s 100 most endangered monuments in the world. Restoration and preservation began in 2008 through the Calvary Fund, and some original features are gradually being moved to the Slovak Mining Museum in the Old Castle for safekeeping. Although restoration is still ongoing, religious events still take place. Throughout the year there are three important feasts: the Feast of the Cross (May 3), the Feast of the Transfiguration of Jesus (August 6) and the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (September 14). The latter festival is also known as the Pilgrimage of Calvary, when hundreds of people come to mark the anniversary of the completion and consecration of the site. Other masses are also held here, along with an increasing amount of weddings. And if the religious and cultural aspects do not grab you, it is still worth the climb to view the panorama of rolling hills extending out around the historic site.

The viaduct (viadukt) is a magnificent piece of infrastructure. The railway bridge consists of nine arches, each over 30 feet wide. In total, the span is about 370 feet long and 60 feet high at its peak. Despite its ancient look, the railway bridge was built in the 1930s, and it is still in use today. It connects two tunnels along the Červená Skala-Margecany train track of the Telgártska loop, which is impressive in its own right. The curved spiral track ascends over 560 feet in altitude by traversing 40 feet of very rugged terrain.  Chmarošský Viadukt is clearly visible from the main road. Dirt tracks through the meadow lead directly to the viaduct. The viaduct is sometimes referred to as Telgárt Viadukt due to its proximity to the town of Telgárt.",engineering railroads trains infrastructure bridges nature architecture
101,Fountain of Union,"Bratislava, Slovakia",The largest fountain in Bratislava.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fountain-of-union,"At the center of a city square in Bratislava stands a gigantic relic of the Communist era. It’s called the Fountain of Union, and it’s the biggest fountain in all of Slovakia. The fountain was built between 1979 and 1980. It was designed so that water would flow from an underground tunnel before bursting into the air, creating an impressive, yet peaceful spectacle. It takes the shape of the linden flower, a sacred plant in Slavic mythology. But things aren’t quite right with the enormous fountain. It stopped being maintained after the fall of the Soviet Union, allowing water to seep into and damage its underground control spaces. The water stopped flowing in 2007, and the fountain has been dry ever since. It has been estimated that repairing the fountain would cost one million euros. Yet though water no longer flows from its depth, the fountain is still worth admiring. It’s as if the fountain has been transformed into a stagnant sculpture; a piece of art that speaks to the city’s Eastern Bloc past.  It’s in the city center, so it's easy to access.

103,Levoča Cage of Shame,"Levoča, Slovakia",Too much gossip or just missing curfew could land you in here for a couple of days.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/levoca-cage-of-shame,"Public shaming has, sadly, a long history. Stocks and pillories were used for centuries to put criminals and troublemakers on public display, to try and keep a town’s rowdier elements in check. Throughout parts of Europe there was another form of humiliation as punishment, called the “cage of shame.” Such a cage can be found in Levoča, a small Slovakian town that dates to the 16th century. Fashioned from wrought iron, it looks more like a big bird cage than anything else. In keeping with its reformatory intent, there is a small metal heart worked into the design of the door, as if to welcome the next delinquent and whisper “this is for your own good.” In order to maximize the dishonor, the cage was often used during markets, fairs and festivals, when crowds were teeming. Miscreants would be locked up for any number of offenses: excessive gossiping, cheating on your spouse, public drunkenness, or just staying out too late could all land you inside for a couple of days, where you’d be pelted by rocks and rotten vegetables, or just plain old spit. You can find cages of shame in other Slovakian towns, but this one is said to be the biggest and most historical. It’s in the old Town Square, which is bordered by the renaissance Town Hall, colorful medieval row houses, and a 14th century Church of St. James. The cage is kept locked most of the time, but occasionally it’s opened up for special events. On those days feel free to pop inside for a shameful gag photo. Levoča is in eastern Slovakia, in the richly historical region of Spiš. The Cage of Shame is in the town square, in front of the old Town Hall (which is now a museum).",renaissance prisons crime and punishment medieval

The building is designed as an inverted steel pyramid that glows burnt orange in the sunlight. Completed in the mid-1980s, this building continues to house Radio and Television of Slovakia, a public broadcasting station. There have been several rumors that claim the shape of the building actually affects energy flow or that the building was modeled after the Great Pyramid of Giza. In 2017, the structure was named a national cultural monument for being an excellent example of Central European Modernist architecture. Inside the building’s concert hall, visitors can see one of the largest organs in Slovakia. The hall is suspended in a steel structure and is mounted on acoustic springs that dampen vibrations from the outside.  It’s such a special space that the Vienna Philharmonic records inside, it’s also the place where Nokia recorded its classic polyphonic ringtones.

106,Biatec Monument,"Bratislava, Slovakia",A massive sculpture of an obscure Celtic coin that has become a symbol in Slovakia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/biatec-monument,"It’s unclear who Biatec was. The name appears on the coins that circulated among the Celtic tribe of the Boii, minted in what is present-day Bratislava around 60-40 B.C. These rare ancient coins are also referred to as Biatec (or Biatex) by modern scholars; while this has not been confirmed, it was likely the name of the leader of the tribe. Generally sizing 25 millimeters (just under an inch) in diameter and weighing about 17 grams, the silver coins were equivalent of Hellenistic hexadrachms or tetradrachms, which they are believed to have imitated. Fourteen hoards consisting of these coins were unearthed in the 20th century, six of them in Bratislava. The obverse usually showed a bust or two facing right, while the reverse was a horseman or an animal, both mythological and real, such as the griffin, lion and boar. Under the reverse figure was an inscription in capital Latin letters. There are 14 known types of inscriptions, but the one that appears the most frequently was BIATEC, sometimes shortened to BIAT. Although rather obscure internationally, the Biatec coin has become a sort of icon in Slovakia. From 1993 to 2008, its design was featured on the five-Slovak koruna coin, and even today, the horseman can be seen on the National Bank of Slovakia’s logo. In 1988, a bronze monument shaped after and commemorating the Biatec coin was created by sculptor Ľudmila Cvengrošová. More than a hundred times larger than its real-life counterpart, the monument was 3 meters (10 feet) in diameter and weighed 3 tons. It was relocated in front of the National Bank of Slovakia in 2008, one month before the country’s transition from the Slovak koruna to euro.",coins celtic money monuments statues
107,Devinska Kobyla Missile Base,"Bratislava, Slovakia",A relic of the Cold War tucked away in the forested hills above Bratislava.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devinska-kolyba-missile-base,"Built between 1979 and 1983, this abandoned missile base combines a pleasant forest hike with urban exploration.  The base was built as a part of the Warsaw Pact to provide defense against air attacks from NATO. It was abandoned around 1996 and the mostly concrete structures are being reclaimed by nature. There are at least 15 buildings and missile storage bunkers remaining. Some are easy to find as you follow the paved paths, and others are hidden in the woods. During the base’s peak operation, there were 16 anti-aircraft missiles housed in the bunkers. Now the bunkers are concrete shells, some of which have narrow hallways with dark, windowless empty rooms where a flashlight is necessary. Many of the buildings are covered in graffiti, and it appears that the larger pieces are updated regularly. If you continue just above the highest point in the base, there is also a new lookout tower with sweeping views of Bratislava and eastern Austria.  On clear days, you can also see Czechia and Hungary.  The easiest way to reach the base is from the Dubravka neighborhood.  Follow Plachého street to Vojenská Cesta and continue going uphill until you reach a gate.  No cars are allowed beyond this gate. Near the gate, there is space for parallel parking on the sides of the road. You then need to walk up the paved road beyond the gate for 30-45 minutes (depending on your speed) and you will reach the remnants of a fence with a large abandoned building on the left. The paved road loops around the outside of the base and you can reach many of the abandoned structures from that road. If you prefer to walk, there is an unpaved trail that stays close to the paved road for the majority of the walk to the base. You can also approach the base on foot from Devín or Devínska Nova Ves. Online guides to hiking trails on Devinska Kobyla are available. Take care while exploring—there are several man-made holes in the ground that are not covered. And in some of the buildings there are also holes in the floors that can be hard to spot. Around some of the buildings, there is a lot of broken glass and rusty metal on the ground.  Sturdy footwear is recommended. If you choose to explore inside the bunkers, a flashlight is needed.",missiles cold war soviet history abandoned military

It has been there since 1809, when Bratislava (called Pressburg back then, and one of the major cities of Austrian Empire) was bombarded by Napoleon Bonaparte. After the bloodbath of the Battle of Austerlitz (1805), Pressburg saw Napoleon sign a peace treaty with Austria. The peace did not last long and only four years later, the power-thirsty Napoleon was again pestering Pressburg with countless troops and cannons. His troops found a base on the left side of the river Danube, in today’s suburbs called Petržalka. The cannonballs thus flew over the river over a mile’s distance. The siege lasted for a month, during which Bratislava suffered much damage. Yet, the siege was unsuccessful and Napoleon never managed to breach the city’s defenses. Bratislava emerged victorious. More than 100 houses were damaged during the siege. Perhaps to commemorate the bittersweet victory, the inhabitants kept many of the cannonballs in the walls of their houses during subsequent repairs. They can still be found around Bratislava’s historic city center. Several legends surround the Napoleonic siege. One tells the story of an injured French soldier, Johann Evangelist Hubert, who was treated in a hospital in Bratislava. Nursed to health by the beautiful Paulina, he fell in love, got married and stayed. He opened a sparkling wine manufactured according to the French tradition. The brand Hubert still exists until this present day. Another legend says that Napoleon sought advice from the famous Jewish thinker and rabbi Chatam Sofer, the founder of the Pressburg yeshiva. Back then, Bratislava was an important center of Orthodox Jewish teaching. The town hall was built in the 14th century, while the tower is an older building from the 13th century. The complex was not only used as a town hall but also as a mint, occasionally a prison, a place of trade and celebrations, a depository of the city’s arsenal, and a municipal archive. Enriched throughout the centuries with Renaissance and Baroque elements, the Town Hall still shows its original Gothic style and is one of the city’s oldest stone buildings still standing. The building houses a permanent museum exhibition of Bratislava’s history.  The cannonball is on the outside of the Town Hall, thus can be visited at any time. The museum inside the Town Hall is open 10 a.m. - 5 p.m. on every week day except Monday, and from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends.",napoleon bonaparte weapons towers history

Above the façade of a neon-signed ice cream shop, the creepy little man—known in Slovak as Posmievačik, meaning “mockingjay” or “sneerer”—has an oversized phallus, big enough for him to appear to be sitting on it. There have been many stories speculating on the unusual effigy’s origin, which is believed to date back to the Middle Ages. In one story, the statuette was created in order to poke fun at the former owner of the building, who would spy on the passers-by below from his bay window. Another tale relates a drunkard’s unsuccessful courting of his neighbor’s wife. The statuette was apparently made to ridicule his inappropriate behavior, and eventually caused the man to sink into alcohol and flee the city out of shame. Other stories claim the little stone man belonged to the mayor’s house, or that it was erected to win a love triangle. No one seems to know the true background of Posmievačik, and few locals even know of its existence.  The statuette is on the south side of Panská, just west of Strakova.",phallic medieval statues

The museum is dedicated to the history of this uprising against the Nazis and the Slovak fascist government. This unusually-shaped museum was designed as both a monument and a museum by architect Dušan Kuzma. The museum is a concrete, semi-angular geometric shape divided into two parts and separated by a courtyard. The building and the surrounding grounds were built between 1966 and 1969. In the courtyard between the two halls stands a towering sculpture called “The Victims’ Warning;” an eternal flame burns there as a memorial. The museum’s exterior park includes several Czechoslovak, Russian, and German military vehicles, as well as cannons and a Soviet Li-2 plane that was used to bring supplies to resistance fighters.

The name of the Stolpersteine in Slovak is pamätné kamene, meaning “memorial stones.” The project aims to commemorate individuals at their last place of residency or, in some instances, their place of work, which was freely chosen by the person before they fell victim to Nazi terror, eugenics, euthanasia, deportation to extermination camps, or those who managed to escape persecution by emigration or suicide. This is achieved by placing small brass plaques (10 centimeters by 10 centimeters) engraved with the names and life information of those who were killed by Nazis. The first pamätné kamene were placed in Slovakia in 2012.  Pamätné kamene are currently placed at 16 locations in Bratislava. City representatives from Bratislava have gone on record as stating that these stones should express the respect and wish for the Slovak capital to become, again, a place where people of different cultures and creeds can live together side by side peacefully. Most pamätné kamene are placed to commemorate Jewish individuals but criticism has been voiced about the project. Charlotte Knobloch, described it as “unbearable” to put the names of murdered Jews on plaques which are then embedded in the ground where people can step on them with their feet. Many other prominent Jewish leaders however defend the memorial stones. Joseph Pearson, a Cambridge historian, argues that “It is not what is written [on the stolpersteine] which intrigues, because the inscription is insufficient to conjure a person. It is the emptiness, void, lack of information, the maw of the forgotten, which gives the monuments their power and lifts them from the banality of a statistic.”  The stones can be found at various locations around Bratislava as well as across Europe.

The water goblin wished to join the fun, and one day he disguised his amphibian physiognomy and green hair made of seaweed.

And perched along the outskirts of the tiny town is Huta Etelka, an old iron factory home to the area’s prized blast furnace that’s now little more than dilapidated ruins. Ironmongery boomed within the region during the 19th century. Count Emanuel Andrássa built this factory and its blast furnace in 1867 to keep up with the demands. The Count named the furnace, which replaced two older ones, after his mother. The great furnace melted iron ores from nearby mines. The metal was then shipped off throughout Slovakia until the small factory hit its decline. It closed in 1907 and a newer, bigger iron factory was built nearby. Sadly, time has not been kind to the historic structure, which some see as a monument to the region’s metallurgical past. Its current owners are unwilling to salvage the factory, and thieves continue to loot bits of metal and scraps from within its walls. But all hope may not be lost. A local nonprofit hopes to rebuild and restore the ruins and transform the space into a mining museum.  There are no clear signs forbidding entrance to Huta Etelka, but it's private property. Reporting to the security guard stationed at the nearby active iron factory prior to entering is recommended.

122,Predjama Castle,"Predjama, Slovenia","Castle and secret tunnel withstood a siege until its owner was killed by the Holy Roman Empire, while sitting on the toilet.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/predjama-castle,"Built directly into a rocky cliff face, Predjama Castle, or Predjamski grad in Slovenian, was considered virtually impenetrable when it was constructed in the 13th century. However, a few centuries later the structure’s fortifications were put to the test when a robber baron started a war with the Habsburgs and was forced to hole up in the castle for over a year. According to legend, Erazem Lueger and his family had taken over the Gothic Predjama castle in the late 15th century. Acquiring land and power, Erazem had become a well-known robber baron in the region. However, he quickly grew too big for his britches, murdering the kinsman of Frederick III, the Holy Roman Emperor. With the strength of all of his forces, Frederick came after Lueger, and forced him into hiding in his castle. Despite the Emperor’s superior forces, the rebellious Lueger had both brains and a secret tunnel between the castle and the nearby Postojna Cave. For an entire year and one day, Lueger snuck out of the castle and replenished food and drink through the tunnel from a nearby town. Finally, after surviving for so many days, one of his servants sold him out. Waiting for Lueger to use the outhouse on a high floor of the outside face of the castle, the servant raised a flag and one single shot from a cannon blasted the baron off the toilet. The castle has been completely reconstructed many times over the years. With a Renaissance-style remaining, the Gothic facade and the legend of Erazem Lueger are often forgotten. However, the Postojna Cave is still in use, allowing visitors to relive the siege and covert activities of a knight who crossed the wrong royal family of Europe. Another peculiar fact is that the cave under the Castle is the home to a colony of bats.  Approximately 10 km from Postojna Cave. The best option pricewise is to purchase a combo ticket with entry to the cave and the castle.",secret passages tunnels subterranean sites architectural oddities architecture

Often referred to as the “Underground Grand Canyon,” the Eastern European cave system features one of the largest subterranean chambers in the world. The biggest room in the limestone cave network, known as “Martel’s Chamber,” is a gaping canyon which was formed by the underground flow of the Reka river, which still rushes along the bottom of the chasm. Thanks to the amount of water that flows through the canyon, the caves also hold a number of eye-catching geological features such as limestone pools, travertine terraces, and giant stalagmite formations. The cave’s unique spaciousness also hosts a number of species of bat, countless unique bio-organisms, and even a variety of fish that have never seen the light of day. A bridge has been built spanning the chasm so visitors can experience the colossal geologic divide. Archeological research in the area found that the caves were home to humans as far back as 10,000 years in the past. It’s likely that the caves were used by ancient people for shelter, and, although there is absolutely no science to support it, the Skocjan Caves also seem like they may have been the perfect lair for a dragon.

In the late 1800s Bled Island and village, located in the middle of glacial Lake Bled, were seen as a health resort by aristocrats from around the world. Today the island and the Assumption of Mary Pilgrimage Church are known to be major tourist attractions. Bled Castle is an iconic landmark because of its location teetering on a cliff overlooking the lake. The Assumption of Mary Pilgrimage Church was built in the 15th century and is known by visitors because of the 99 steps that lead up to the church. Traditionally, local grooms carry their brides up these steps while the bride remains perfectly silent, in order to bring them happiness in the future. The church also has bells that visitors ring for good luck. Tourists can hire boats to get to the church. Bled is famous for a dessert called the Bled Cream Cake which can be purchased at many of the cafes and restaurants in Bled.  Following the signs for Trail 6, the inclined trek begins. You will pass a small farm and then are quickly enveloped in the forest. After about 10 minutes, the trail splits to the right for the first lookout point, Ojstrica, which makes the initial steep climb pale in comparison. After a set of steep switchbacks, in the last five steps to the top, the view begins to emerge. The lookout point features zero barriers. There are no fences, no railings — just you and the wind and the rocks and the magnificent scene. To reach Bled Island, you will need to take a boat.

Originally built in 1911 by the Austro-Hungarian Army, the site consists of seven barracks buildings sitting on a little over three acres of land. The military used the little walled neighborhood until 1991 when the army abandoned the site as Slovenia attained independence from Yugoslavia. Once the site was vacated, it wasn’t long before groups of squatters began moving in, and making the old buildings their own. In 1993, the Slovenian government tried to demolish the old barracks, but nearly 200 activists, artists, and protesters took over the site and saved it from destruction, for a time. The government never gave up trying to tear down the site, but the squatters and protesters that continued to hold the never gave up their fight. One of the buildings, known as the “Old School” was successfully taken down in 1997, and another building, known as the “Small School” was also demolished in 2006. However the remainder of the space remains as a rebellious artistic community space that is still in some amount of contention with the government. These days most of the buildings have been covered in graffiti, folk art, found tile mosaics, weird sculptures, and punk rock statements of purpose. It now also houses a bar, a nightclub and a hostel, as well as the free-living squatter population. A museum called Galerija Alkatraz is now located in Metelkova.

Visitors are offered green felt cloaks to shield them from humidity before the train chugs past underground lakes and enormous caves, including the massive Concert Hall. Many of the stalagmites have assumed strange, humanoid shapes over time, giving the cave network the appearance of a goblin kingdom. A trip to the caves sometimes allows a peek at the olm, or “human fish”. These blind amphibians take their nickname from their human coloring and can grow up to 16 inches long.

Festooned with ornamental dragon statues among the already ornate embellishments, this delightful monument is a favorite with visitors who love to see through it the playful (or frightening?) side of the city. While medieval in style, this attraction came into being in the early 20th century as part of urban renovation. An 1895 earthquake had damaged the previous boring old wooden bridge, and the powers that be decided to try out a new, innovative technology called reinforced concrete, and throw some cool dragons in there for good measure. The bridge stands as a technical monument to the new static calculations of the time, and to the reinforced concrete that forever changed urban expansion. In the early 1980s, the bridge was renovated with a lightweight concrete. The beautiful fantasy-themed bridge holds the titles to a couple of firsts: first Slovenian bridge paved, first reinforced concrete bridge in Ljubljana, and it came in a strong third for largest arch in Europe at the time of its construction.

Located in the center of Ljubljana, Slovenia, the monolithic structure blends art and science, measuring the blueness of the sky and looking stunning doing so. Not only does Baraga’s cyanometer periodically capture images of the sky and measure them against the 53-shade color wheel toward the top of the structure, it uses the data to imitate it, changing color to blend in with the sky. Day and night, cloudy or bright, its reflective surface shines for passersby in the various shades it adopts. Like a traditional cyanometer, the sculpture, which is more than 10 feet tall, is also a scientific instrument. From the blueness of the sky it determines the air quality in the area, which is affected by the presence of moisture and particles in the atmosphere. A nearby Environmental Agency of Slovenia measuring station assists the sculpture in collecting this data and determining its exact nature. The cyanometer then sends the information to a website and displays it, along with the temperature, on its own surface, with air quality measured on a color scale that goes from red to green. Invented by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in 1789, the original cyanometer was made with 53 squares of dyed paper, arranged in a circle from white to black by way of shades of blue. By holding the device up to the sky and studying the blueness under different circumstances, de Saussure established the criteria that Baraga’s cyanometer uses to measure the quality of the air today. The cyanometer in Ljubljana was installed in the town’s pedestrian zone in 2016, and Baraga, an intermedia artist, plans to install similar devices in York, England, and Wroclaw, Poland, in 2017. It is part of Baraga’s “Nonuments” series, installations in public places based on futuristic and utopian ideas. The sculpture is made of glass and stainless steel and powered by solar panels, which means not only does it power itself in the center of Ljubljana, but it could do the same anywhere in the world. Slovenia’s capital city has been working toward becoming as green as possible for the past 10 years, and the installation of the cyanometer corresponded to Ljubljana being named the European Green Capital of 2016. This makes it perhaps the best place for such an installation, one that both judges how clean a city’s air is and literally reflects that cleanliness back at it.",environment instruments of science science monuments sculptures
129,Velika Planina,"Stahovica, Slovenia",An otherworldly alpine pasture with its own unique microculture that recalls Middle Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/velika-planina,"On May 29, 1944, an American B17 Flying Fortress bomber plane called Liberty Bell crashed atop an otherworldly mountain in Slovenia. The World War II bomber went down on Velika Planina, an idyllic alpine plateau where centuries of herders have grazed their sheep and cattle. Located high in the Kamnik-Savinja Alps, Velika Planina (which means “Big Pasture Plateau”) is no ordinary mountaintop. Tourists compare it to the mythical Narnia (indeed, parts of the Narnia films were made in Slovenia) or J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth, and it truly is a fantasy land—a flat, rolling meadow dotted with low-slung wooden houses and backdropped by the snowcapped Alps. This high mountain landscape also has its own unique microculture, with a traditional costume (wooden shoes and a raincoat made of pine shavings), food (Trnic, a hard, parmesan-like cheese that is intentionally made in the shape of breasts—and made in pairs, naturally), houses (low-slung against the wind, looking like Hobbit holes), and folk traditions (a local ethnographic museum has a knife carved with enchanted runes, to work against curses). And in 1944, this enchanting landscape was the site of an extraordinary event. Ten Allied soldiers were on the plane went it crashed on Velika Planina, two of whom were killed on impact. Nazi soldiers were occupying Slovenia at the time, and the hunt was on for the remaining crew members. Two were eventually captured by the Nazis, but six others were first found by the local Slovene Partisans (an anti-Nazi resistance group). Three of these airmen were well enough to make their own way down the mountain, but three were badly hurt, including the pilot, and were taken to a secret Partisan hospital that was hidden in the thick forests below the mountain. The American soldiers needed an IV drip, so supplies were precariously smuggled from the nearest town, Kamnik, by Partisans. Two of the Allies successfully recovered from their injuries over the course of a 10-day stay in hiding at the foot of Velika Planina. In the end, the captain, Oto H. Hinds of Boulder, Colorado, could not be saved. He was buried near the secret Partisan hospital. The gravesite that can be visited today, along with the ruins of the hospital, along a beautiful walk from Kamniška Bistrica up towards Velika Planina. Scrap metal from the crashed Flying Fortress was gathered by locals and used to construct buildings. Look closely and you’ll notice that one of the cowherd huts on Velika Planina is fitted with a very special door, which was once the hatch to the bomber.  Velika Planina can be accessed by car (a long circuitous drive to the top), or by a 10-minute gondola ride from Kamniska Bistrica, near the town of Kamnik. It is open for skiing in the winter, and you can rent cottages there (most without electricity or running water). There are numerous good mountain huts that serve food and drink, and it is great for hiking. Once you're at the top, Velika Planina is almost completely flat, making it good for walking, even with children. Visitors should be informed, that even if arriving by car, they cannot drive the last leg of the trip. Be prepared for an uphill walk to this magnificent site.

The start of the lane is marked with an image of a key, historically used to note the street name for those that couldn’t read. As you continue down the path, a mysterious sight unfolds. Cutting through the middle of the cobblestoned street is a gully that appears to be flowing with hundreds of strange little faces. The limbless bronze casts are highly expressive, almost theatrical. Some are happy, some crying, some almost grotesquely distorted. There are 700 of these bronze faces running through the center of the alley, culminating in a drinking fountain and a couple other odd sculptures, namely a bronze hand and a skeleton trapped in a cage. This surreal scene is the work of the renowned Slovenian sculptor Jakov Brdar, whose bizarre bronze figures can be found throughout Ljubljana. Often, his work is inspired by Greek mythology, as is the case with the sculptures on the Butchers’ Bridge in the center of the city. The faces of Locksmith Street were inspired, however, by a piece of writing by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. It begins, “To think, for instance, that I have never been aware before how many faces there are. There are quantities of human beings, but there are many more faces, for each person has several.”  The ""Faces"" installation can be seen on the ground of Ključavničarska ulica in Ljubljana's medieval old town.

132,Olm,"Postojna, Slovenia","The ""dragon babies"" of southeastern Europe.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/olm,"The olm (Proteus anguinus) is a species of blind amphibians endemic to the deep underground caves of the Dinaric karst of southeastern Europe. The unusual appearance of the olm is the result of extensive adaptations to its habitat. Olms inhabit deep underground lakes and pools, where they spend their entire lives in almost complete darkness. As a result, the skin of these animals is devoid of pigment, making it resemble white human flesh. The local name of the creature is “oveja ribica,” which means “human fish.” The snake-like olm was mentioned by Charles Darwin in his seminal work On the Origin of Species as an example of the reduction of structure through disuse. The eyes of the olm are severely underdeveloped, an adaptation to its dark surrounding. Larval olms retain normal eyes for the first four months of life before the organs start to regress. By the time the species reaches its adult stage, the visual system has almost completely atrophied. Olms retain many other neotic (juvenile) traits, common in other amphibian species—most notably a pair of well-developed gills—into adulthood. The strange appearance of these creatures has made them an object of human fascination for centuries. Although their deep-water habitat is generally inaccessible, flood waters occasionally carry olms to the surface. Medieval legend considered them baby dragons, as their serpentine bodies and gills corresponded well to the descriptions of these mythological reptiles, and their soft pale purple skin resembled that of a human newborn.  These creatures could be best observed in Postojnska Jama cave complex in Slovenia, a well developed tourist spot with a museum which displays a captive colony of olm (The only place in the world other than the inaccessible underwater caves where visitors may view live olms).",underground caves animals

Its lush leaves form a verdant stipe along the wall, creeping outward from the gnarled cordons. When in season, Žametovka grapes dangle from the plant like sweet, sugary ornaments. The Old Vine is, according to Guinness World Records, the oldest grape-producing vine in the world. It was planted more than 400 years ago to make wine when the Turks invaded the city. Centuries later, it’s a beloved resident of Maribor and even has its own anthem, which many locals will proudly sing, glass of vino in hand. The plant is a stalwart specimen, a resilient survivor of centuries of turmoil. Though the building it stretches across was once a wall that shielded the city from invaders, the vine escaped from many siege attempts intact. It somehow managed to thrive despite the fires that blazed within the wooden structures that once surrounded the space, then later endured a parasite that plagued nearby vines in the 19th century and outlasted the Allied bombing that destroyed nearby buildings during World War II. Now, the vine wraps around the outside of its very own museum. After admiring the old plant from the outside, you can enter its resident building to learn about the city’s wine heritage and sample some drinks in the wine tasting room. There’s also an annual festival to celebrate the vine’s ceremonial grape harvest, which yields upwards of 120 pounds of fruit.

135,Tuhinj Valley,"Laze v Tuhinju, Slovenia",A beautiful drive through the foot of the Alps traces the path of 15th-century Turkish raids.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuhinj-valley,"For many centuries, cities and town have lit huge bonfires atop mountains or other high points to warn against impending danger. The first fire lit would alert the next beacon, creating a chain reaction at the first sign of trouble. This ancient relay system was at play in 1471 when a raiding party of the Ottoman Turkish army made a foray into the Tuhinj Valley in what was then part of the Habsburg Empire, and is now in northern Slovenia. As the invaders approached the town of Kamnik from the south, the first beacon would have been ignited at Stari Grad, the castle on a high cliff above the town. Further bonfires would have ricocheted along the Tuhinj Valley, running eastward, flames coursing into the sky from hilltop to hilltop. Bonfire watchtowers were set up at Posavje, Sveta Gora, Limbarska Gora, Sveti Miklavž, and Menina Planina, warning the settlements several miles further on of the coming danger. There was little the locals could do. There were castles but no standing army, and the Turkish raiders moved swiftly. Thankfully for Slovenia, the territory was deemed too poor, too far from Istanbul, and too close to the strongholds of Venice and Vienna for the Turks to focus their attention there for long. So Slovenia avoided the might of the army proper, evading the fate of Serbia and Bosnia, and instead had to deal with periodic, smaller-scale incursions that were, nonetheless, terrifying. When the bonfires were spotted, the locals would rush to their churches, many of which were built with fortifications designed to withstand such raids. The citizens would bundle into the church, lock the gates, defend the walls, and pray fiercely. Sometimes this worked, other times not, but all in all, Slovenia got off lightly in terms of enemy armies over the past thousand or so years. A beautiful short drive now follows the exact path of those marauding Turks back in 1471, as it carves through the lovely Tuhinj Valley (pronounced “too-heen”). The valley, called “Tuhinjska Dolina” in Slovenian, is cut through with a road linking Kamnik and Vransko. Taking a half-hour to drive without stops, the route passes an endless array of heavenly vistas, swaths of farmland, “kozolci” (a unique Slovenian hay rack), fortified churches, clustered villages, some good home-cooking country inns, and even a thermal spa. While the Turks made their way from wealthy Kamnik on east through the valley towards Vransko, and you could certainly drive that direction, many suggest the ideal path is the other way, especially if you’re a motorbike enthusiast. The reason is that the town of Vransko has—wait for it—the Slovenian Motorcycle Museum, home to a large and impressive private collection. As you head on into the valley, you can wind your way to Motnik, a village crowned with an enormous church and ringed with fields of grazing cows. In Laze v Tuhinju you can stop at the Meninc Farm, where farmer Frenk brews his own beer (as microbrew as it can get) using his own hops (he grows the “styriaca” variety, indigenous to Slovenia). In the village of Šmartno, which is actually a conglomeration of 13 different villages, the church of Saint Martin stands as the first church in Slovenia consecrated after the Second World War. In the village of Gora, you can visit one of the fortified anti-Turkish churches, Sveti Miklavž. It includes a pair of defensive towers and a “black kitchen,” a medieval kitchen still in use and blackened with smoke over the centuries (you leave smelling like bacon, in a good way). The main attraction in the valley is the thermal spa, Snovik. The highest-altitude spa in the country, it hosts tens of thousands of guests a year, who come from around the world to relax and bathe in the natural waters that emerge from an aquifer 120 meters beneath the earth and stay a delightful 30 degrees Celsius. There are good eats along the way, too. The down-home Pri Čibru serves enormous portions of cutlets, roasts, schnitzel, potatoes and more. For more refined fare, try Repnik, near Kamnik. There you can sample some of the hyper-local dishes specific to the Tuhinj Valley, especially Tuhinjska fila (Tuhinj Stuffing), which consists of bread, whipped egg whites, egg yolks, and either sweetmeats (if you’re going traditional) or smoked pork neck. It’s like the best stuffing you’ve ever had crossed with an omelet. You want to try this. On your arrival in Kamnik, you can enjoy the liveliness of a larger town, visit its three castles (including Stari Grad, where the beacon bonfire was first lit), sample its many microbrews (it is a candidate for microbrew capital of the world, for the most microbrew beers per capita), and spend the night. For home cooking, there is the Yugoslav retro Gostilna Murka, which is conveniently located a few hundred feet from Samostan Mekinje Monastery, where those pesky Turks, back in 1471, pillaged and ran off with the nuns in residence.  If you want to spend the night in this area, you can sleep at Snovik, a significant thermal spa resort, where the above address and map coordinates point to. You could also enjoy a night in the medieval monastery in Kamnik, at Samostan Mekinje Monastery, where former monastic cells have been spruced up into hostel-style rooms at very cheap rates. To visit any of the beautiful churches along the Tuhinj Valley, you normally need to call ahead, or stop at the Tourist Information Center in Kamnik, or at the front desk at Snovik, and ask them to call for you. There are special tours available, often for free, and various local events and experiences can be arranged--from wine and beer tastings to massages to hikes--with a bit of advanced notice.",landscapes beer roads mountains medieval food history

137,Kamnik,Slovenia,This small Slovenian town has become a magnet for microbreweries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kamnik,"In previous decades, Slovenia was full of microbreweries with around 200 in operation. The microbreweries were gradually bought up and closed down by the two national beer giants, Union and Lasko, in an effort to eliminate the competition. Today, the town of Kamnik is a haven for microbreweries. For decades, entering a bar in Slovenia and ordering a beer was only a question of choosing red (the color of the Union can) or green (the Lasko). Then starting in the late 90s, a few pizza pubs started making beer alongside local independent microbrewers. Today, there are between 60 and 80 microbreweries in Slovenia, many of which can be found in the city of Kamnik. The reason there are so many microbreweries concentrated in Kamnik comes down to one thing: its water. Kamnik is celebrated for having pure, good quality water. Water is crucial in beer-making because of its calcium. Calcium determines the “hardness” of water and helps to define the flavor and clarity in a finished beer. In Kamnik—where oddly enough the water quality changes just a short drive out of town—water quality plays a big role in the number of microbreweries popping up.  You can taste the local beers at Gostilna Korobac or Pub Pub Skalo, both in Kamnik. For more information or for beer-related tours, you can contact Tourism Kamnik.",slovenia kamnik beer

The story of Navje is the circular story of abandonment and restoration. In the 1700s, as an amendment to the St. Christopher’s Church, a cemetery was started. It was the only primary cemetery for notable figures of Ljubljana and Solvenia as a whole, and held prominence until the early 1900s. It became a secondary location only after the new architecturally superior Zale cemetery was completed, 2 miles Northeast under designer Jože Plečnik, notable for his works in Vienna and Prague. St. Christopher’s cemetery had now fallen out of favor, and after moving the majority of its inhabitants, it was largely abandoned, becoming overgrown and run down in just a few short years. Working on another project in a corner of the old cemetery, Plečnik had an idea: to turn a portion of the older cemetery into a memorial shrine to the most famous and deserving Slovenians. The stunning white stone arcade, built in 1865, was repurposed as a Pantheon of Slovenian heroes, and between 1936 and 1940 the graves and headstones of further notables were moved into the park. Given a new name, “Navje,” derived from Slovenian folk mythology, the park began to take shape. But in April 1941, the Axis invaded Yugoslavia, and all construction on the park came to a screeching halt. The city, burdened by war, once again neglected it. During the war, remains scheduled to be buried in Zale were unceremoniously buried in Navje, and key remains meant to be relocated there such as Prešeren’s, Trubar’s, Maister’s and Rusjan’s were never moved. As World War II ended, Plečnik fell out of favor with the communist government of Yugoslavia, the grand aspirations for Navje were forgotten, all burials there stopped, and it was abandoned. For five long decades, Navje was neglected,  but when Slovenia gained its independence, a new sense of national pride was resurrected, and they began restoring the park in the 1990s. Today the park is a beautiful place to sit in the quiet or enjoy the company of a few friends. On any given day Navje will be home to people running with their dogs, strolling with baby carriages, or enjoying a few rays of sun. It is a park of remembrance of the dead and recreation for the living.",catacombs and crypts

The Yugoslav Partisans were a communist-led group that fought against the Axis powers, and were said to be one of Europe’s best anti-Nazi forces. Spomenik Padlim Partizanom Gornikom (Monument to the Fallen Partisan Alpinists) rests on a bed of rock under the north face of the iconic Mount Triglav, the celebrated Slovenian national mountain. It is one of the many tributes to the Tito’s “National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia” spread across all of former Yugoslavia. There are spomeniks scattered throughout the Balkans, in Slovenia and beyond. They honor those who fought and died in the battles and that filled the mountainous region, as well as the mass executions and concentration camps so many suffered in. In this particular alpine area, many of the Partisans had mountaineering backgrounds, making the oversized yet simple depiction of basic mountaineering equipment a fitting tribute.  The monument is situated in the Vrata Valley in the Triglav National Park and is easily accessible with a 0.5-kilometer trail walk from the Aljažev Dom hut.

140,Cast-Iron Dogs of Tivoli Castle,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Strange rumors surround the artist who created these solemn metal guard dogs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cast-iron-dogs-tivoli-castle,"When you take a stroll through Tivoli, the largest park in Ljubljana, you may come across four cast-iron dogs sitting gracefully at the foot of Rožnik Hill. These statues stand guard on a staircase that leads to a beautiful mansion, might look ordinary to any passerby. But don’t be fooled—they are all missing a vital muscular organ, and are somewhat of an enigma. These four iron-cast hounds were made around 1864, by the sculptor Anton Dominik Fernkorn. The Austrian artist and well-acclaimed animalier is the main protagonist in a contemporary urban legend. Local rumors have it that the artist was a perfectionist at heart. During the process of developing his sculptures he was preoccupied with perfecting their design, and completely forgot about the dogs’ tongues. He didn’t realize his mistake until it was too late. A false rumor circulated that the sculptor shot himself after the statues were revealed to the public. Though the details of the actual tale are not fully known, records disprove the notion that Fernkorn committed suicide. They state that the sculptor became ill in 1865 and was no longer able to work. That same year he was admitted to a mental institution, where he passed away at the age of 65. These facts possibly explain the persistence of the commonly believed folktale. Apparently, the sculptor was institutionalized shortly after the unveiling of the dogs in Tivoli. When he disappeared, it must have seemed to the locals as if he had vanished. To this day, the four dogs still keep watch on the doorstep of Tivoli Castle. The mutts solemnly glance towards the Jakopič promenade, designed by architect Jože Plečnik, and keep watch as new outdoor exhibitions, with large-format photographs, are revealed to them. These four-legged sculptures are definitely worth checking out.  This location is a stone's throw away from the city center.",art outside dogs castles parks statues animals
141,Plečnik House,"Ljubljana, Slovenia","The Slovenian architect designed many landmarks in the capital city, including his own dream house.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plecnik-house,"Jože Plečnik was a man constantly at work on something. When he wasn’t designing much of his native city of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, he was devising gadgets for the house in which lived, in the suburb of Trvono. He usually designed for convenience or economy, with barely a hint of extravagance—he smoked the cheapest cigarettes, used pencils till they were little more than stubs, and slept in a narrow single bed. After having worked in the studio of Viennese secessionist Otto Wagner and designed a flat in Prague Castle for Thomas Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia, in 1921 the architect moved into his brother’s house in Ljubljana and soon set about redesigning it to create his dream home. He envisioned “a tower, a mule, me and the garden.” He got his garden, which extends some 150 feet to the back, and a tower, a simple circular two-storied wing which he designed and added to the house. When he later bought the neighboring house, he added a conservatory or “winter garden.” This marked the beginning of his Ljubljana phase, during which he designed landmarks like the Triple Bridge and the National and University library. After his death, his nephew was the caretaker of the complex, and the city took it over and opened it as a museum in 1974. It saw extensive renovation between 2013 and 2015, and the rooms were restored to their original state, as they were laid out when Plečnik was alive. Today, a permanent exhibition based on Plečnik and his career is housed in the complex. His studio, where he conceived his ideas for building Ljubljana in the classical idiom with Secessionist or art nouveau touches, is still very much as he left it, and contains his equipment, sketches, plans, and models. The most curious item on display is the candle-holder, a brass curiosity that can be raised and lowered to avoid wasting wax. A dragon’s head, which also looks like the devil, curves around toward the candle ready to light it with its fire, but to to avoid that, the candle can be lowered. Other ingenious gadgets are scattered around the house. The chairs were made hard and rigid, meant for work, study, and designing—not for relaxation. That was Plečnik’s ascetic philosophy, which fit well with his monk-like existence. In the kitchen, there’s also a special chair where he could eat and work at once. Plečnik lived alone and rejected all suggestions that he get married. His house was designed to be a simple but practical bachelor pad—his bookcase was within reach of his bed, a narrow, unadorned piece of furniture, and his light switch could be reached from his bed too. He described his house as a “testing hotbed” in which he would experiment with architectural ideas, most commonly how he could give classical architecture a new lease of life in his beloved Ljubljana.

142,Ptuj Castle's Collection of Traditional Carnival Masks,"Ptuj, Slovenia","The costumes depict the Kurent, the star character of the annual Kurentovanje festival.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ptuj-castles-collection-of-traditional-carnival-masks,"Each February, just before Shrove Tuesday, the small town of Ptuj plays host to a 10-day folk festival called Kurentovanje. Celebrations culminate in a musical parade of colorful characters such as spearmen, fairies, bears, giant chickens, and women carrying drunk men in baskets (šoštanjski koši). Central to all this is the whirling, dancing figure of the Kurent: a horned, hulking, sheepskin-clad creature with a dark protruding snout and large red tongue. The first Kurentovanje festival was held in 1960, having been organized to preserve the rich traditions and customs of the Ptuj region. Key to this were the mythical gods, demons, and other creatures from folklore, including the Kurent. Modern-day tradition holds that the Kurent is a mischievous, almost demonic creature who chases away winter and heralds the beginning of spring. To aid him in this endeavors, he wears a chain belt festooned with bells and wields a club, the ježevka, topped with hedgehog quills. Look deeper into the past, however, and the Kurent’s role and origins are less clear-cut. Some folk tales describe him as a wine-loving agent of unbridled joy; a Slavic version of Bacchus or Dionysus. Others contend he is a malevolent lunar deity or a promiscuous fertility demon. Evidence even links him to Slavic creation myths involving a cosmic egg and cataclysmic floods, casting him as mankind’s savior (though still with a penchant for wine). You don’t have to attend Kurentovanje to get a taste of the legendary character. Ptuj Castle maintains a collection of Kurentovanje costumes and traditional Shrove masks, providing an intimate look at the Kurent.  The Kurent and wider set of Kurentovanje costumes are housed in the Collection of Traditional Carnival Masks, next to the ticket office at Ptuj Castle",carnival fashion festivals museums and collections museums

It was the capital city’s first power plant and continued producing electricity until the 1940s when its obsolete technology was replaced by a heating plant on the edge of town. Parts of the plant were brought back into service in the 1960s, and today it continues to produce a third of the city’s electricity. But it also serves a more creative, modern function: as an authentic industrial background for the performing arts in Slovenia. Artists began displaying work in the unused parts of the power station building in the 1980s, and in 1998 the Ministry of Culture began renovations to make those areas even more conducive to the arts. Bunker, a nonprofit performing arts organization, was awarded management of those parts of the building in 2004 by the city, which was looking to remedy the lack of rehearsal spaces in the area. The 2004, Mladi Levi (Young Lions) festival of contemporary performing arts marked the official opening of the program. Bunker’s program for Stara Elektrarna divides the power station into three sections: rehearsals and residencies, educational workshops and seminars, and performances. It hosts theatre and dance productions, concerts, and other events backdropped the industrial space.

Well, Soteska Pekel (“Hell Gorge”) in Slovenia has five of them and is famous among the locals as a wonderful place to swim and relax during the summer. The gorge was created as a result of the sinking of the Ljubljana Marshes, which span 163 square kilometers south of the Slovenian capital city. Its steep dolomite walls show alternating bands of dark and light rock, which geologists have used to learn about the ancient history of this region. The trail to Soteska Pekel starts next to Pekel Inn and a small devil statue. Although it’s relatively easy, it can get a bit steep and narrow at times. The highest of the waterfalls is at about 450 meters above sea level. The round trip to see all the waterfalls takes about two hours, not counting swimming breaks. You can also go higher to the top of the gorge at 650 meters to the rocky Devil’s tooth formation.  Soteska Pekel can be found in the village of Borovnica and reached by car or public transport. The train from Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, takes 20 minutes to Borovnica and you can walk the rest of the way to Pekel Inn (about 45 minutes down the road).

The modern design and a thin, sharp minaret makes you think you entered a rocket launch facility. Located in a semi-industrial area of the Slovenian capital, the mosque, which can hold up to 1,400 people, is the heart of the six-building Islamic Cultural Centre. All of the buildings are made from white concrete, combined with elements of steel, glass, and wood. Inside the mosque, a large blue dome makes a bold statement. Other features include the main prayer hall, a standalone minaret measuring 40 meters in height, an educational center, a gym, a park, and a restaurant. The Ljubljana Mosque is the first mosque in the country. The Muslim community in Slovenia has been working towards its construction for decades, with the first request to build a mosque filed in 1969, when Slovenia was still part of former Communist Yugoslavia. The community finally received permission in the early 2000s, but ran into opposition from right-wing groups who tried to stop the project, but the courts denied their requests. After plans to build in a different location fell through, the mosque’s location was acquired in 2008 and its foundation stone was laid in 2013. The mosque opened to the public in February 2020. It cost a staggering 34 million Euros to build, with the a large portion of that money donated by Qatar. The rest was raised by the Muslim community in Slovenia.  The mosque is open to non-Muslims on designated hours. The opening hours are Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays between 10 and 11 a.m. The exterior is freely accessible to all. Go early in the morning, it is quiet and light is beautiful. There is a convenient parking attached to the mosque.",mosques islam architecture

This traditional cake is made from yeast-raised sweet dough, rolled thin and spread with fillings. But while many may be familiar with one version of the cake, it’s a versatile shapeshifter that takes on various forms and fillings depending on regional or familial recipes. While it’s rare to find many of these different styles in one place, you can find a dizzying array of potica at a small bakery on northwestern Slovenia’s Bled Island. Located in the middle of a glacial lake, the island is accessible only by small rowboats, known as pletnas, that are propelled by a single, standing ferryman. Many visitors make the trek to the island to see its church and its castle, but its bakery, Potičnica, churns out more than 50 flavors of the classic Slovenian cake. Island bakers combine a wide array of sweet and savory ingredients in their potica, including pumpkin with apricot, tarragon with raisin, or smoked bacon with herb. The bakery’s “lavish potica” features a sweet-and-salty combination of walnuts, cottage cheese, and chocolate. The establishment also covers the basics—think ground walnut (the most common filling in Slovenia, which gives potica the English nickname “nut roll”), poppy seed, or ham. For those looking to sip something along with their potica, Slovenians typically pair sweet versions with coffee or wine, and savory versions with a cold beer.  Those looking to learn how to make their own potica can arrange for a baking lesson on the island.

147,Idrija Mercury Mine,"Idrija, Slovenia",This was the second largest mercury mine in the world and one of the oldest preserved mine complexes in Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/idrija-mercury-mine,"The mining history in Idrija goes back to 1490. At its peak, it was one of the main sources of mercury, along with Almaden, in Spain. Mercury is a rare metal and its deposits are scarce. Most of it is in the form of ore known as cinnabar (mercury sulfide). Idrija is one of the very few places in the world where mercury occurs in both its elemental liquid state and as cinnabar. Mercury can be used to extract silver and gold, therefore the silver and gold-rush motivated mercury mining. Most of the history and development of Idrija revolves around mercury. The mining industry brought science, technological advancements, and industry to this mountainous region but it also created considerable medical problems and health hazard due to its toxicity. In addition to collapse accidents, there is a local folklore associated with hallucination experiences that miners had when working in the narrow passages inside the mountains. Soon after the accidental find of mercury (a tub maker found drops of the liquid metal in a creek) a shaft was dug in 1500. Known as Anthony’s shaft, it still stands and is one of the oldest preserved mine entrances in Europe. There have been some other shafts that have been closed or sinked. Altogether around 700 kilometers of tunnels have been dug under the town. After over 500 years of excavation the mine was closed in 1995. However, Anthony’s shaft can still be visited today. It leads to small part of the whole tunnel system that is now opened as a museum. In addition to the mine visitors can also stop by to the Castle Gewerkenegg. Initially the administration of mine was located in this castle. Now it is opened as Idrija Municipal Museum with most of the expositions associated with mercury mining as well.",metal mines mountains

The complex, which dates back to the turn of the 20th century, has been preserved as a cultural monument. It now houses a small museum dedicated to the history of steam locomotives in Slovenia. The Šiška Railway Vehicle Workshop once housed bustling repair, maintenance, and production workshops. Now some of them are passive, timeworn witnesses that have survived the Austro-Hungarian Empire, two World Wars, and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This is the oldest semi-preserved railway facility in Slovenia, and urban explorers can freely examine the premises. Climb on top of the rusty locomotives, wagons, and platforms that are scattered around the actual railway museum. Embrace the history, but know that you do so at your own risk. The Slovenian Railway Museum is located in the workshop, standing as a testimony to the end of the steam locomotive era. It is located in what was once the main boiler room of the facility. The idea for the museum came in the 1960s, and was gradually developed into a small but comprehensive facility that opened its doors in 1981. Today, it has beautifully restored locomotives on display. It is thanks to the railroad workers from Slovenia, who supported the thought of a railway museum in 1960, such as the official Yugoslavian railway museum in Beograd, that this museum came into being.  The facility is located in Šiška, close to the city center of Ljubljana. You can leave your car at the railway museum's paid parking lot.

So, while the rock formation of “Ajdovska Deklica” is traditionally known to English speakers as the “Heathen Maiden” in English, it should be noted that this maiden is a little more fantastical than heathen. According to local folklore, the maiden was a good-hearted villager who often guided travelers through snowstorms. Said to be a nymph or forest spirit in some renditions, she also had prophetic abilities and could foretell the fates of unborn babies. One day, she prophesized about a boy who would grow to become a hunter and catch the Zlatorog, or Goldenhorn, a mythical chamois buck with magical powers. Infuriated that she foresaw the death of the Zlatorog, legend says, the maiden’s siblings placed a curse on her. When she returned home on Mount Prisojnik, her body was transformed into stone.

Its series of cloisters within had sheltered nuns since around 1300, shielding them from 16th-century Turkish raids, world wars, plagues, and everything that the last 700 years in central Europe could throw at them. The story of the monastery began on October 9, 1300, when Seyfrid and Elizabeta Gallenberg donated their land. From that year until 1782, the monastery was in the hands of the Poor Clares and was overseen by the Franciscans. Through the Middle Ages, monasteries like this one functioned just like feudal estates run by lay lords. In June 1471, three units from the Turkish army traveled from Ljubljana to Kamnik. The Turks looted the monastery and kidnapped the nuns, holding them as captives. The northern gate of the wall built around Kamnik to hold off Turkish raids was named after these nuns, called Frauentor, Old German for “the Nun Noor.” In 1681, the monastery was renovated extensively. Little of the pre-renovation wooden monastery can be seen today. The monastery was rebuilt in stone from the ground up and completed in 1686. This included an embowered orchard, gardens, two large interior courts, a new chapel, and a bell tower. The monastery was one of the hundreds dissolved during the Enlightenment by Austrian Emperor Joseph II in January 1782, causing the nuns to abandon it. From 1799 to 1814, it was a prison for French soldiers captured by the Austrians and also a hospital. When Napoleon took over and established the Illyrian Provinces in what is now Slovenia, the monastery became a barrack for the French army. The Austrian recaptured the area in 1814 and the monastery then housed Austrian soldiers. The monastery was once again active in the early 20th century, becoming home to Ursuline nuns and a girls’ school. During the First World War, it was used as a military hospital for Austro-Hungarian soldiers. During the Second World War, the Nazis occupied the town of Kamnik and cast the nuns out of the monastery, using it as a barracks. After the war, the victorious Partisans allowed the nuns to return if they promised to feed and house displaced Yugoslav citizens until they could return to their homes. The socialist government would have nationalized the monastery and sent away the nuns, but a plan was hatched in 1949 to register the nuns as national workers, who would therefore receive a salary from the state and welfare protection but had to wear civilian clothes. This lasted until 1959, when a part of the monastery was indeed nationalized and various sections were used for technical training), a juvenile detention center, a workshop for folk artists, and “towel storage.” But what finally drove the remaining nuns out were the utility bills. In 2016, the last of the monastery’s resident nuns gifted the enormous complex of buildings to the township of Kamnik, as they were no longer able to pay for its upkeep. The township decided to transform the Samostan Mekinje Monastery into an international cultural center. The most modern section, from the 19th century, is equipped with hostel-style bedrooms that can sleep 80, which have hosted internationally-renowned artists, Baroque music festivals, and numerous free talks, exhibits, and events. There are plans for the monastery to become a national center for visual arts, as well as a host location for study abroad programs.  Entrance to the monastery is from the left side as you drive up. There are events many times per week, but you should check the website for scheduling. Most are in Slovenian, but there are some events in English, including free talks and workshops. Starting in September 2019, visitors will be able to stay at the monastery overnight for very low rates, so it is a good place to stay while visiting Kamnik and central Slovenia.

152,Domžale Straw Hat Museum,"Domžale, Slovenia",A wonderful museum dedicated to the local straw hat industry.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/domzale-straw-hat-museum,"Just how exciting can a museum of straw hats really be? As it turns out, much more than you might expect. This tiny museum is not just an exhibition about making straw hats with a few samples on display. Rather, it offers a glimpse into the glory days of the Slovenian town of Domžale. Domžale was once a thriving textile hub, known far and wide for its straw hat production. And this was no small industry: Before the Second World War, it was customary in the West to wear hats when outdoors, and straw hats were preferred in hot weather or while working. The town began as a tiny village with access to fields of wheat, the straw from which was used to produce hats and baskets and other dry goods. The straw was set aside and dried. In foul weather or winter months, local families would braid the straw together into usable threads, called butarice, which could then be sewn in the hats. These woven braids were either used at home to prepare finished products, or were sold to factories. In the late 19th century, some of the wealthier Hapsburg mercantile families, mostly of Austrian or German descent, moved to Domžale and found wives there, then set up factories for making straw hats. Around 1900, there were 25 straw hat factories of varying size in tiny Domžale, with around 1,000 people employed. The town population rose from around 1,200 in the mid-1800s to over 2,100 by 1920, and those factories produced around one million straw hats a year. Subsidiary factories opened in Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest, Prague, Florence, and as far away as New York. In fact, 390 residents of Domžale moved to the United States, headhunted because of their expertise in straw hat making. Many of the best straw hat makers were women, and the museum displays photos of Domžale ladies teaching a factory full of Americans how to sew butarice. The last Domžale factory, Univerzale, closed down in 2003, after 130 years in business. Now, straw hat making is just a boutique art form practiced by a few enthusiastic locals, a reminder that sometimes the smallest of towns can have a big impact on history.  Open Tuesday through Saturday. Entrance is free. The museum also hosts events and a Straw Hat Fair each June.",hats crafts local history industrial history
153,Gredič,"Brda, Slovenia","The summer residence of a Spanish ambassador who brought viticulture to an impoverished region, sparking its transformation into one of the world's best wine regions.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gredic,"Overlooking the vineyards of Goriška Brda stands a modest but elegant castle called Gredič, the story of which is key to the transformation of these villages from an impoverished backwater to one of the world’s most prized wine centers. Goriška Brda is a cluster of 45 villages spread over 72 square kilometers (28 square miles). The region has a special terroir known as opoka in Slovenian or flysch in English, that carries over across the modern border with Italy into the Italian region of Collio. This was a single region from ancient Rome through the Second World War, when a border was inserted in the middle of the once-unified area. The feeling of unification is still so great that Goriška Brda and Collio have a cross-border initiation for a designation of origin status for their wine (DOC)—the first such case in the history of the EU. What makes the soil great is the double-whammy of this having once been beneath a prehistoric ocean (resulting in the high mineral content of the soil), and the terrain pocked with small hills. Organic material runs down those hills when it rains and so they are not very fertile, meaning that vines grow slowly and sparsely, but what does grow is packed with goodness and of the utmost quality, their fruit far better and more sophisticated (this is why the best terroirs are spartan, and rich soil, like in rainforests, does not produce good grapes for wine). The poor soil is counterbalanced by idyllic climate above-ground. Goriška Brda enjoys plenty of sun, freshness from the sea without interference from its salt-licked winds (it’s about 40 km to the Adriatic), and the cool air sweeping down from the Alps. The most famous owner of Gredič was Count Silverji de Baguer. He was born in 1838 in Odessa, where his father, Jaime, was the Spanish consul. In 1872, he married Cecilia de Catterini-Erzberg, the sole child of an aristocratic family from Goriška Brda. Through her, he inherited several properties here, including Dobrovo Castle and Gredič. De Baguer was a diplomat, working for many years as the Spanish ambassador to the Holy See in Vatican City. He introduced Brda wines to the papal cellars, and is credited with bringing wine cultivation to the region. De Baguer recognized the potent terroir long before anyone thought in terms of “terroir.” He planted the first vines in 1880, and his vineyards expanded to cover 315 hectares that produced some 1,200 hectoliters of wines per year. Of course, grapes were grown and wine was made in the region before De Baguer’s arrival, but he helped to develop it in a more organized way, at a grander scale, and implemented leading technologies and scientific advances of the time. During his lifetime, sweet wines were preferred in this area, and he helped develop a taste and fashion for dry wines aged in glass bottles. He was also an early oenophile who kept an extensive archive of wines and notes on cultivation and what he had tasted. He was an enthusiast for the local Rebula varietal (Ribolla Gialla in Italian), a hyperlocal, indigenous ancient white grape written about by Roman authors, Boccaccio and a favorite of Habsburg nobility, but which had fallen out of fashion. Baguer was such an influential figure, the driving force in shifting Goriška Brda from a humble place where wine was made primarily for local consumption into a place associated with good wine. To honor his memory, Zvonimir Simčič, a local who was Yugoslavia’s leading wine expert in the mid-20th century and who founded Klet Brda, Yugoslavia’s largest winery (and still the largest and most prestigious today), named the high-end range of wines produced by Klet Brda Bagueri, as a nod to his most direct predecessor as godfather of viticulture in the region. Simčič’s family later purchased Gredič and turned it into a hotel and wine tasting center. Gredič was first built in the 17th century as a rural retreat. “Gredič” means fortress, but the design of the current structure makes it clear that this was never meant for fighting. Relatively large original windows, angled rather than rounded corners, and only a single tower mean that it would not put up much of a fight if attacked, so the name likely refers to an earlier defensive structure that was later replaced by the current, more sophisticated manor house. The tower, however, may be a holdover of an earlier period—it is needle-thin, consisting only of a spiral staircase, and the staircase winds counterclockwise as you descend. The year 1774 is carved into the Palladian-style chapel adjacent to Gredič, so this may have been the year that the building as it can be seen today was erected. Count de Baguer died in 1927, leaving his estate to his firstborn daughter, the evocatively named Elvira. Other owners included the Codelli family, and so the building was referred to as Villa Codelli. The Codellis were a fascinating bunch, none more so than Baron Anton Codelli III (1875-1954). A captain in the Austro-Hungarian Army, he served as director of the Duchy of Carniola and a district captain of the Postojna region (halfway between the Adriatic Coast and Ljubljana). He was a polyglot and adventurer, traveling to China, India and Japan. He studied law after his military career, but his passion was inventing. He filed patents for early electric vehicles and designed motorboats, rotary engines, lawn mowers and much more. He was most enthusiastic about the fledgling automobile industry, and he drove the first car in Slovenia, a Benz Velo Comfortable (which was probably not all that comfortable), a proto-car that looks like a stagecoach on bicycle wheels, which he took from Vienna to Ljubljana in 1898. Goriška Brda was once so poor that, in Yugoslav-era Monopoly boards, it was the cheapest property you could buy. It was thanks first to Count de Baguer, and then to Zvonimir Simčič, that it became a stronghold for white wine that is considered among the best in the world. Its viticulture and the stories of these two men are embodied by Gredič castle.  Gredic is now a luxury hotel and includes a fine dining restaurant, as well as a tasting room.

154,Alpine Ski Museum,"Begunje na Gorenjskem, Slovenia","This cutting edge museum details the history of skiing, from its ancient origins to its status as a sport.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alpine-ski-museum,"For fans of alpine skiing, there is no greater name than Ingemar Stenmark. The Swede racked up 86 World Cup wins, and is universally acknowledged as the sport’s all-time great. He’s a fitting figurehead to open the new Alpine Ski Museum, which he did in June 2018. The Ski Museum is located in the town of Begunje na Gorenskem, Slovenia, a short drive from the famously photogenic Lake Bled and other charming localities. Tiny Begunje is famous for a handful of big things: a pair of castles (Ravensburg and Kamen), the home and museum of polka legend Slavko Avsenik and the world-renowned ski manufacturer, Elan. The Alpine Ski Museum is a branded affair, organized by Elan and housed adjacent to its outlet store. While the skis featured are from the home brand, they’re the very skis that won famous competitions. Elan is best-known for having invented carving skis in 1991, which are today the universal standard for recreational skiers, but in the museum, the history of skiing is still objectively presented, complete with interactive displays. In the museum, you’ll find a mechanical ski and snowboard simulator (think of skis and a snowboard on a giant metal spring), a digital slalom simulator, and the material components of skis laid out so you can put them together and make like a master ski-smith. Elan was founded in 1945 to provide skis for the Partisans in Yugoslavia, so they could better fight the occupying Nazis, but the history lessons offered in the museum look back to 10,000 BC, the approximate date when a cave painting of a hunter on skis was carved into the rock of the Altai Mountains, along the border between China and Mongolia. A similar carving from circa-3500 BC was found on Rodoy Island, Norway, demonstrating that skis were used to hunt wherever humans lived in snowy conditions. Wooden components of what experts consider proto-skis have been found at Vyg Lake in Russia dating to between 7000 and 5000 BC. It seems that strapping wood to your feet to better glide over snow has been an idea employed for as long as you can imagine. Alpine skiing as a sport was developed by the Austrian, Mathias Zdarsky, in the 1890s, but most skis were just straight, smooth wooden planks, sometimes curled up at the front, and with leather straps to hold your feet in place. The biggest technological revolution in skiing happened to come in 1991, the year of Slovenia’s independence, when Elan created the Sidecut Extreme (SCX) ski, based on the principle that carving (making smooth, sharp turns) is easier on a ski that has more of an hourglass shape than a stiff, straight plank. This shape, referred to more generally as “carving skis,” has become the industry standard from that point on.  The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.",ski sports museums and collections museums

156,Čebelarski muzej Radovljica (Museum of Apiculture),Slovenia,This Slovenian museum houses the country's largest collection of painted beehive panels.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-apiculture,"These panels are a unique part of Slovenian folk art. The tradition of painting the frontal panels of beehives is a unique Slovenian tradition. The Museum of Apiculture’s collection includes more than 800 examples and is the richest in Slovenia. These paintings present different motifs of everyday life, historical events, relationships, but also illustrate folk tales, proverbs, and different religious themes. The oldest panel is dated 1758, depicting the Pilgrim Mary. This tradition was most actively followed during the 19th-century, roughly between 1820-1880, but it has faded during the 20th-century due to changes in beekeeping technology. In the past, beehives were made by beekeepers themselves. Sometimes the painted panels were bought from rural painters, sometimes they were also done by the beekeepers. The decorations were made with natural pigments and colors, therefore they faded over time. It’s not entirely clear why this tradition of painting the front panels of beehives started. However, it represents an important testimony of folk imagination and ways of thinking of rural Slovenia in the 18th and 19th-centuries.  The painted beehive panels are presented in some other local or ethnographic museums in Slovenia but the Museum of Apiculture in Radovljica has the most extensive collection on display.",bees art museum history & culture art
157,Dimnice Cave,"Markovščina, Slovenia","Deep underground, the rusting remains of a German water pumping station from World War II.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dimnice-cave-devils-smokehouse,"The Dimnice Cave is spectacular enough on its own. A vertical cave mouth opens up from the earth with a railed path spiraling tens of meters down from the forest above. Once past the locked gate, your guide leads you into a largely unspoiled natural karst cave system. Here you’ll find a treasure trove of geological formations and small animals eking out a life underground. Far down in the cave system, along the underground river, you’ll encounter decaying manmade walls, rusting handrails, and a concrete slab. On the floor are the damaged footings where once stood a water pump. During the German occupation, this pumping station was installed to supply water to the troops above. During your initial descent, you might have noticed a curious circular hole going straight down into the cave, and a channel along the slope seemingly pointing at an angle towards the surface. These were the locations of pipes that fed water up and out of the cave. After the war, locals decided they wanted nothing to do with water provided by enemy hands and dismantled both the pump house and the pipes.  The cave is locked with a gate regularly so visits are only possible with a guide who has cave access. There is typically a standard weekly visit time on Sundays where a guide will wait for a group to form before leading them in. There may be a cap to these groups, and/or also a fee per person check in advance to be sure. Important: The geologists and custodians of the cave have installed grip fabric paths in spots, and cut steps in other places to provide better footing for visitors and minimize wear to the cave floors. Even with those additions, very grippy hiking boots or trail running shoes with appropriate traction are a must. The cave floor is naturally damp and uneven.

158,Casa Batlló,"Barcelona, Spain","One of Antoni Gaudí's most classic buildings is well-known for its ""dragon-back"" design.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-batllo,"One of Gaudí’s most iconic works, Casa Batlló was built to look more like the physical layers of an animal than a private residence. Also known among locals as the “House of Bones,” Casa Batlló seems to have been designed with the shapes of organic viscera in mind. The house was built in 1877 and purchased by the middle-class Batlló family in 1900 due to its central location and (originally) undesirable appearance. In 1904, Gaudí was commissioned to redesign the facade and interior of the structure, making it priceless. The facade is divided into three distinct sections, each reflecting a level of anatomy. The base level looks as though it is gridded by huge abstract bones, while above that the front takes on a more chaotic, abstract pattern echoing blood vessels and muscle, and then the entire structure is capped with a scaly roof section that looks like nothing so much as the back of a giant dragon. The interior of the building is no less organic. While Gaudí only remodeled an existing building, it would be hard to tell from the smooth, undulating insides of the large noble hall. Walking the halls is like strolling through the soft organs of some immense creature. The Batllós have long since vacated the building, but it is still open as a museum dedicated to the architect and visitors can experience the unique building for themselves.",eccentric homes homes architectural oddities architecture
159,Sagrada Família,"Barcelona, Spain",Construction of Barcelona's iconic (but controversial) church is expected to be completed in 2026—a century after the death of its architect.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sagrada-familia,"When the foundation stone of the Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família was laid in 1882, it’s unlikely that anyone involved anticipated that the construction of this church would take well over a century to complete. But when Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, now famous for his unique take on the Modernista movement, took charge of the project a year later, he scrapped the original neo-Gothic design plans and exchanged them for a grander vision, unlike any the world had ever seen. Gaudí worked steadily on his masterpiece until he died after being hit by a tram in 1926, at which point an estimated 15 to 25 percent of the total design, including the crypt, the apse walls, a portal, and a tower, was complete. Since then a series of architects have attempted to continue his legacy. Not surprisingly, progress on Sagrada Família’s construction has faced a few setbacks over the past 130+ years. Vandalism in 1936 following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War resulted in the destruction of many of Gaudí’s models. The sacristy was destroyed in a fire in 2011. When complete, the church will be composed of three major facades, two of which — the Passion facade and the Nativity façade — have already been completed, while construction of the Glory facade remains ongoing. Much of the ornate Nativity facade was completed by Gaudí himself, who feared that beginning with the austere Passion facade would temper the public’s enthusiasm. The Passion facade’s gaunt, tortured figures, sculpted by Josep Maria Subirachs, have met with probably some of the harshest complaints from critics, though the church’s website defends the design, saying its graphic nature remains true to Gaudí’s original vision of a facade meant to inspire fear. The Glory facade, expected to be the largest and most impressive of the three, began construction in 2002. The church’s interior is defined by columns that stretch like tree branches toward the ceiling. Gaudí’s love of nature and its link to religion can be seen throughout with numerous carvings of animals and other wildlife. Gaudí’s plans also called for 18 spires, eight of which are complete, as well as numerous towers, chapels, portals, and other interior features. When built, the tallest spire, which symbolizes Jesus Christ, will secure Sagrada Família’s place as the world’s largest church building. Though Sagrada Família is said to be Gaudí’s magnum opus, the architect appeared unfazed by its glacial progress,  remarking, “There is no reason to regret that I cannot finish the church. I will grow old but others will come after me. What must always be conserved is the spirit of the work, but its life has to depend on the generations it is handed down to and with whom it lives and is incarnated.” Despite this statement’s apparent acceptance of the inevitable variations on his design at the hands of the architects who followed him, some have advocated for leaving the church unfinished out of respect for the original designer. Some projections have Sagrada Família’s completion date as 2026, the centennial anniversary of Gaudí’s death, while others estimate construction could continue into the 2040s. Though still incomplete, the church sees an estimated 2.8 million visitors every year.  It's best to visit in the early morning or late evening as the sun shines through the stained glass windows on the walls filling the church with an abundance of color. You're also likely to have less of a wait and crowd to navigate through around these times.

Work on the labyrinth and the surrounding gardens began in 1791 as part of a wealthy estate owned by the Desvalls family. The maze and its attendant Italian-inspired terraces were part of the original construction that is today known as the Neoclassical section of the park. The majority of the rest of the park was created in the mid-1800s, and is now known as the Romantic portion, however as the name implies, it is the central labyrinth that really steals the show. The tall manicured hedge walls of the maze create over 2,000 feet of twists and turns for visitors to get lost in. Anyone who makes it to the center will find a statue of Eros, Greek God of Love, implying that the romantic part of the garden existed even before any expansion. There are also pavilions that overlook the maze and feature their own statues of Greek gods, and a picturesque pond at one end. The gardens were given over to the city of Barcelona in the 1960s and are now a public park. Since it is set off from the regular tourist strips, the Horta labyrinth remains a magical little secret for those willing to get a little lost.

Built between 1900 and 1914 as part of Gaudí’s naturalist phase, the project was initially designed as part of Count Eusebi Güell’s private city, who envisioned the plot as a self-contained residence with private homes for 60 families. Only later was the failed housing development reimagined as a municipal park, which opened to the public in 1924. Nestled among Carmel Hill’s north face, the main terrace of the park offers sweeping panoramic vistas of the city below – including many of Gaudí’s other famous creations peppering the landscape – featuring a scalloped perimeter and a giant bench built to resemble a sea serpent. At the main gate, a giant salamander known as “el drac” or “the dragon” greets visitors upon their approach to the terrace, as they wend their way through a network of Doric columns, some palm-like, that support a pillowy roof inlaid with mosaics. Colonnaded footpaths lead to manicured gardens and trick arboretums, as gracefully curving viaducts and roadways soar overhead. Gaudí’s former home, too, now converted into a museum, is easily distinguished by its Pepto-Bismol pink exterior rising four stories tall from the garden grounds. Despite embodying a purpose entirely separate from its initial conceptualization, Park Güell remains so transcendent in its current form that it was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984, ensuring that the public will continue to find respite in this fantasy world for centuries to come. Access to the Monumental Zone of Park Güell is limited to 400 tickets every half hour. Most of the park is free to get into, but for the Monumental Zone including Plaça de la Natura and Gaudi's famous Salamander, you need to have a timed ticket.",art nouveau unesco gardens parks plants architecture
162,Calder Mercury Fountain,"Barcelona, Spain",A beautiful but toxic fountain of mercury.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/calder-mercury-fountain,"Mercury, also known as quicksilver, is a beautiful, mirror-skinned metal that is liquid at room temperature. It is also extremely toxic. For many years, the world’s greatest source of mercury were the mines at Almadén, Spain, which produced some 250,000 metric tons of mercury over nearly two millennia of operation. So when Spain decided to build a monument to the mine (which was long worked by criminals and slave laborers, most of whom died of mercury poisoning), they commissioned American sculptor Alexander Calder to build a graceful fountain which, instead of water, would pump pure mercury. Calder’s Mercury Fountain was displayed at the Spanish Republican Pavilion for the 1937 World’s Fair in Paris, and was situated in front of Pablo Picasso’s famous painting Guernica. Like Guernica,  Calder’s sculpture should be understood in the context of the Spanish Civil War and was intended to have a political meaning. At the time, Almadén was controlled by Republican forces and under an extended siege by General Franco’s fascist troops. The inherent beauty of the liquid metal was well understood, but its toxicity was not. Today, the fountain resides in the Fundacio Joan Miro in Barcelona, Spain, and continues to pump pure mercury, though now it does so behind a pane of glass to protect viewers from touching or breathing fumes produced by this toxic work of art.  Catch the funicular up Montjic Hill from Paral·lel station, turn left on exiting the station, and the Joan Miro Foundation building is about 100m on the other side of the road.

Built as anti-aircraft fortifications in 1938, during the Spanish Civil War, the bunkers atop the hill of Turó de la Rovira were situated so that they could survey the entirety of the city. Large 105 mm cannons were mounted on the concrete and masonry defenses and helped protect Barcelona from further bombing. After the war, the guns were removed and the bunkers were simply left to crumble. Yet the view from the site was too lovely to stay neglected for long and eventually the old bunkers became known as a beautiful, if a bit remote, place to take in the historic city. In the 2000s, as the popularity of the site grew, the bunkers received a renovation as officials wanted to make it more appealing to tourists as well as celebrate the ancient Iberian settlement that is also nearby. The formerly secret site now regularly sees visitors, but is secluded enough that it is often still fairly private.

Tolkien, the city of Ronda, Spain is perched high atop the two cliff faces of El Tajo canyon as though a fissure opened and swallowed the center of the city. Romans established a settlement at Ronda nearly two centuries before the reign of Julius Caesar, and it has survived through several invading forces until the present. The Guadalevín River, which courses through the site,  has carved a deep canyon that divides the historic urban center. The walls of the canyon are sheer drops to the river over 100 meters below and the white stone buildings are built to the very edge of the chasm. Connecting the two parts of the city are three bridges, the Roman Bridge (also called Puente Viejo), the Arab Bridge (also called Puente San Miguel), and the New Bridge (Puente Nuevo). The first two are so-called to recognize the regimes that built them. The New Bridge was completed in 1793 by the town’s Spanish inhabitants. The bridges are impressive feats of stonework with massive columns reaching down into the canyon, and with ornate roofs, giving the city the multicultural feel that its several conquerors brought with them. In addition to its impressive geology, Ronda is home to Spain’s oldest bullfighting ring, and is a proud supporter of the sport. In fact the fantastical city is well-known for this spectacle, so that several prominent writers and others, including Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles, have lived in or visited the city.",geological oddities geology

Opened in March of 1883, Montjuïc is the biggest cemetery in Barcelona. It’s placed on the top of Montjuïc, which itself is a nice little mountain beneath the Mediterranean sea. You can find there famous graves in the cemetery, like those of Catalan leader Lluis Companys (1882-1940), Spanish anarchist militant Buenaventura Durruti (1896-1936), artist Joan Miró (1893-1983), and many more. If you walk to the top you can see a crematorium from Roman times. The journey to the crematorium is a very long walk. It takes more than 3 hours to tour the entire cemetery. In a silent western wing of the cemetery is el Fossar de la Pedrera (the Grave of the Quarry). An estimated 4,000 people were buried there after their execution by the Franco regime following the fall of Barcelona to fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War. The quarry contains memorials to the victims of fascism and the holocaust, Lluis Companys (the last president of Catalunya before the civil war) and, recently, a monument commemorating the aspirations of the social revolution of 1936. El Fossar de la Pedrera is a moving and melancholy place. Walking through beautiful modernist graves, surrounded by pines and watching the sea. Experiencing this cemetery is widely considered to be one of the most enjoyable experiences in Barcelona. The Cementiri de Montjuïc is a little difficult to reach. The easiest way to get there is to take the 21 bus from the Jardins de Walter Benjamin at the Place de les Drassanes, near (but not at) the southern end of Las Ramblas. But bus will stop at the bottom of the cemetery, after which the 107 bus can take you to the top--this is advantageous as the cemetery is nearly vertical! The more adventurous approach would be to walk about Montjuic until coming across the cemetery from the top. If you do that, do not assume you can walk back toward Las Ramblas/along the sea front.

Coming into port in Spain, Hernan Cortes and his conquistadors brought the spiced treat with them after pillaging the Mayan and Aztec empires of Central America, where cocoa beans had been used to create chocolate variants for over 3,000 years. In honor of this trans-Atlantic transfer, the Barcelona Confectionery Guild has set up the Chocolate Museum to tell the story of chocolate and its modernization. Although the history section of the museum is in no way perfect, visitors get a general trajectory of chocolate’s evolution, moving from bitter water to the stunningly detailed sculptures that fill the museum. By using the statues to visibly depict modern chocolate innovation, the arc of the history of chocolate feels fairly complete. Upon entrance to the museum, guests are greeted by a massive white chocolate ape named Snowy, along with their own chocolate bar as part of their admission. As they munch on the confectioner’s chocolate, guests walk past glass-encased sculptures made entirely of chocolate. The sculptures include some famous cultural icons such as Minnie Mouse and Louis Armstrong. However, the bulk of work focuses on Spanish architecture, proudly featuring Sagrada Familia, one of Gaudi’s famous houses, and creatures from Parc Guell.

Recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s oldest restaurant still in operation, Sobrino de Botin was first opened back in 1725. At the time that the restaurant opened (in the ground floor of an inn), it was actually up to the guests to bring their own meat and ingredients, which were then cooked in the eatery’s facilities. After the original owners died childless, the restaurant passed to their nephew, which is when it got its current name, which translates to “Nephew of Botin,” of course. Over the next two hundred plus years, the trends of the city changed, but Sobrino de Botin never stopped cooking (after it was able to start cooking for people that is). Today the restaurant covers four floors of seating, each with its own Spanish theme, from the brick cellar to the fancier Felipe IV room. Even as the tourists began to flock to the restaurant, as will happen once Guinness gets its paws on you, the cuisine has stayed remarkably true to its Spanish roots, with the whole suckling pig, which is prepared in a brick oven, being the stand-out dish. The Sobrino de Botin likely saw its finest moment when it was mentioned by Ernest Hemingway in The Sun Also Rises, and it is rumored that the famous artist Francisco de Goya worked there as a young man. However, its legacy is clearly thanks to its astounding age rather than to its ties to art and literature.",world's oldest restaurants shops

His buildings are a beloved, defining aspect of the city. Now, visitors can become even more familiar with the iconic architect by stepping inside the first house he designed. Casa Vicens is one of seven properties built by the Catalan modernist in Barcelona and its surrounding areas recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. UNESCO considers its distinctive style an “outstanding creative contribution to the architectural heritage of modern times.” From the tiles painted with French marigolds on the first two floors to its domed rooftop (which provides a beautiful view of the neighborhood), Gaudí’s first major architectural project laid the groundwork for his remarkable oeuvre and paved the way for Catalan Modernism. It’s now a museum, which opened in November 2017 and boasts 15 rooms restored with extensive research and input from descendants of the original tenants. It features a collection of furniture made by Gaudí and 32 paintings by the Spanish painter Francesc Torrescassana i Sallarés. Stockbroker Manuel Vicens i Montaner commissioned the house, which was constructed between 1883 and 1888 as a summer home and expanded in 1925 by Barcelona architect Joan Baptista Serra de Martínez.

The ornate glass and steel greenhouse that sits on the edge of a lake in Buen Retiro Park was finished in 1887 as a space to exhibit arts and wonders in a setting that was both lovingly baroque and still naturally stunning. From the high glass dome to the bright red brick foundation, the building is a thing of beauty. Since the walls are glass, the park’s lush green surrounds can also be appreciated in addition to whatever exhibition is on display inside. The palace is also outfitted with a boat landing on the waters of the park’s small lake and an entrance fitted out with classically styled columns. Since the palace is essentially an elaborate greenhouse it is no wonder that the first exhibition in the space was a display of exotic Vietnamese plants that were brought into Spain for the event. The intention was originally to continue displaying wondrous plants in the space, but as time went on the palace began showing more art than flora.

170,Barcelona Erotic Museum,"Barcelona, Spain",An unusual stroll through gentlemen's erotica demonstrates that pornography is timeless.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-de-la-erotica-de-barcelona,"If the burning sun of the Catalan coast hasn’t already raised your temperature enough and you’d like to get your blood pumping a little faster, a tour of Barcelona’s most aphrodisiacal museum, the Museu de l’Eròtica de Barcelona, will do the trick. A common destination for both kink enthusiasts, museum lovers, and giggling couples, the museum itself appears to be modest, the collection a small but intriguing hotchpotch. The erotic artifacts and contraptions gathered in this tiny building transmit the slightly uncomfortable feeling that they were all owned and cherished by the same collector. You imagine a debaucherous explorer, obsessed with the idea of Orientalism and its voluptuous sensuality, the flexible bodies of Kama Sutra or Japanese Shinga, and pornographic woodcut prints presenting the ordinary sexual practices of the Edo Era. Some may find this museum too small and a bit shabby, but witnessing the sexual habits of our ancestors is always a fascinating experience. An awkward time warp where one’s realized kink can be recorded for the pleasure of others is an ageless concept. In that sense, Barcelona’s Museum of Eroticism can be envisioned more as an archive of mankind’s desires and fantasies than a sultry tourist trap.

171,Sewers of Barcelona,"Barcelona, Spain","Barcelona's historic 19th-century sewers, whose foundations were laid in medieval times, are open to the public for exploring.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sewers-of-barcelona,"Barcelona is known as the birthplace of Catalan “modernisme”, due to the architectural style pioneered there at the turn of the century. However, exploring below the city’s streets betrays the many layers of architecture in its history. An aqueduct-based sewer system was introduced to Barcino, an ancient Roman colony, because when it rained the whole city would flood. Much later, in 1364 when the city had become known as Barcelona, medieval architects expanded on the sewers and ran water beneath La Rambla, the city’s most famous street. It wasn’t until 1886 that Pere García Faria designed the first modern sewers in the city, intended to serve Eixample, the bourgeois proto-suburb being expanded outside the medieval walls. These, too, expanded on and connected with the sewers of previous eras. Today some of these tunnels are still in use. Most are inaccessible to the public, but thanks to a dedicated group of Barcelonian tour guides, the sewers are open for adventuring. The best remnants are located below Passeig San Joan, a strategic avenue which linked Gracia, a formerly independent village, with Parc de la Ciutadella, the site of the 1888 Universal Exhibition. Beneath these streets a whole world opens up: The quiet flow of water in the dank sewers is illuminated by dim fluorescent lights while the city’s hustle and bustle continues on above. The visits are facilitated by La Fabrica del Sol, an institution responsible for educating the public on Barcelona’s environmental activities. Small groups (no more than ten people) are guided by locals who explain the evolution of the aquatic tunnels, their technical processes and engineering, as well as lore and curiosities. Metro: the L4 and L5 Verdaguer. Buses: 6, 15, 19, 33, 34, 43, 44, 50, 51, 55. Visits must be booked through La Fabrica del Sol.

172,Tibidabo,"Barcelona, Spain",Mountain where Jesus was first tempted by the Devil.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tibidabo,"A mountain overlooking Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, Tibidabo stands more than 500 meters tall. The highest peak anywhere in the Serra de Collserola range, Tibidabo is home to an amusement park, a telecommunications tower, and Sagrat Cor, a Catholic church. Sagrat Cor is perhaps the most fitting of Tibidabo’s attractions as this is the site where local legend says the devil tempted Jesus. The name Tibidabo derives from the Latin Vulgate Bible verses, Matthew 4:9 and Luke 4:6. The phrase, tibi dabo, means I will give to you. It was supposedly said to Jesus by the devil as they looked down from a mountain on the kingdoms of the world. The name of Barcelona’s hill, then, refers to how it is the tallest anywhere around. Designed by Enric Sagnier, the church took about 60 years to build. At the top of the church, Sagrat Cor, is a sculpture of the Sacred Heart by Josep Miret Llopart. Tibidabo can be reached by a funicular railway, by bus, and by car. The railway, built in 1901, was the first of its kind in Spain. The amusement park is also the oldest of its kind in the area. Constructed in 1899, the park offers more than thirty different rides, some of them dating back many decades. A few of the original attractions are also still operating, including the Museu d’Autòmates (Mechanical Museum).

Gifted from Egypt to Spain in 1968 in thanks for Spain’s contributions to saving historic sites that would be flooded when the Aswan High Dam was completed, it originally stood in Egypt’s Nile Valley since the 4th century BCE, dedicated to the Egyptian gods Amun and Isis. The temple is located in the middle of a pleasant park, Parque de la Montaña, and surrounded by a pool that reflects its image. It is striking by day and famously magnificent at sunset. The park is on a hilltop allowing for panoramic views of Madrid. By day, tourists frequent the temple while noisy wild quaker parakeets originally from Argentina shriek in the tops of the surrounding chestnut trees. At night, a different crowd arrives: young people drinking in preparation for a night on the town. Vendors snake through clumps of 20-somethings sitting on the grass to offer cans of beer for a couple of euros—mildly illegal, but apparently without repercussion. The temple is lit golden at night, shining beautifully over this buzzing scene, and the lights of the royal palace are visible in the distance. Any time of night or day is appropriate for a visit to the Templo de Debod. Admission to this outdoor monument is free, and photography is permitted—in fact, some hold that there is no better place to photograph the sunset.

174,Jardins de Ca n'Altimira,"Barcelona, Spain",Bask in the 19th century grandeur of an eccentric Freemason millionaire's private gardens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jardines-de-ca-naltimira,"The gardens of Josep Altimira, the eccentric millionaire who returned to Barcelona from Cuba in 1860, are no ordinary gardens. They are especially famous for containing a zoo, subterranean galleries, and a hypostyle room, a pillared hall with esoteric symbolism. The gardens’ allure is bolstered by numerous strange stories of dubious veracity surrounding Altimira’s life in Barcelona, for instance that he had a trained orangutan waiter who served drinks at his parties. Altimira was a truly unusual man. An eccentric Freemason stock market investor with businesses in Cuba, he was known as the “Count of Monte Cristo” for his fabulous wealth. Upon acquiring the estate in 1867,  he built a new house on the property called the “Tower of the Golden Dome.” The gardens were prodigious: In 1880 there were lakes, waterfalls, caves and exotic vegetation. But while the flora was astounding, the garden architecture was what made the place amazing. The spectacular pillared hall was similar to another in nearby Parque Guell. The columns are reminiscent of those in ancient temples, and its underground location is not accidental. The portico provided access to other caves connected to the house. It is said that at various points the caves were flooded so that Altimira and his guests could boat through them. A statue of the god Mercury, which today is preserved in Casa Garí outside Barcelona, resided in the crystal temple. The god Mercury is the equivalent of Hermes, the godly archetype most revered by the Freemasons. This type of garden, reflecting the owner’s intellectual interests, was very common at the time and had precedents in Barcelona, such as the Labyrinth Park in Horta, built in 1802. Joseph Altimira’s princely lifestyle eventually led to his ruin. When he died in 1900, he gave all his property to nuns, the Missionary Sisters, an institution which still occupies the house. The park, however, became property of the city. The public is welcome to come bask in the 19th century grandeur of the Altimira Gardens.

Today, the crooked stone bridge that connects Gaztelugatxe to the shore looks more like something that one might see on Game of Thrones,  but when it was originally built in the 11th century, the span was simply a sturdy lifeline to the religious hermitage erected atop the sea crag. The structure, along with its attendant stone path seems to have been established by the Knights Templar. Down the centuries, the little church has been sacked, burned, and otherwise destroyed, but was rebuilt each time. The church is still standing on the little rock, looking, maybe more enticing than ever, its history simply adding to its charm. The ancient bridge and the hundreds of stairs leading up to the church are still a popular tourist attraction and can be accessed by a well-groomed modern path. Along the bridge are smaller staircases that lead down to reflecting spots at the edge of the water. The hermitage can also be visited, and legend says that after ascending the old staircase, visitors should make a wish. Whether or not you are interested in ancient construction or churches at all, doesn’t really matter as this spot can just as easily be appreciated for its uncanny resemblance to a location you might use in a Dungeons & Dragons game.

These celebrations usually come along with widespread clean-up efforts and struggles to keep the party from getting out of hand. But in Barcelona each August, the neighborhood of Gràcia explodes into celebration, and beautifies the city along the way. While there is an element of partying and revelry to the Festa Major de Gràcia, residents of the usually-quiet neighborhood also fiercely compete for the best decorated street. Often using recycled materials, each block chooses a theme and works to cover every inch of the narrow street. Decorations are stretched between buildings to turn streets into cave-like passages exploding with color and papier-mâché sculptures, and balconies are outfitted with everything from streamers to basketball hoops and giant scissors. Festa Major de Gràcia rages day and night for a week, turning 20 streets in Gràcia into their own new worlds for the time. Although drinking, dancing and partying dominate the landscape at night, the festival also features cultural activities such as human castles (castellers) and a fire run (correc) as well as activities for children during the day, allowing the entire family to enjoy the vibrant and exciting street festival.

177,Atocha Station Tropical Garden,"Madrid, Spain",A lush indoor jungle fills this bustling Madrid transportation hub.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atocha-station-tropical-garden,"The winding paths and many benches within this garden make it the perfect place to kill time or hunker down with a cup of coffee or a book. The lush greenery is a wonderful escape from the chaos of Madrid. It’s so serene, you’d be forgiven for forgetting you’re in a bustling train station, surrounded by commuters dashing around to catch their trains. This verdant garden was inaugurated in 1992. It fills an abandoned section of the building that was once the old Atocha train station before the transportation hub was expanded to include its high-speed train links. The sprawling garden contains 7,000 plants from more than 260 species. In the arboretum section, you’ll find many plants native to tropical forests. Here, you’ll wander among breadfruit and coconut trees from Polynesia, royal palms and mahogany trees from Cuba, rubber trees from Brazil, banana trees from the Philippines, critically endangered palm bottle trees from the islands of the Indian Ocean, and an impressive traveler’s tree from Madagascar. The plants in the garden’s lower section are also originally denizens of the tropics and include African coffee plants, Central American cacao plants, and South American Heliconia flowers. A few stranger plants such as carnivorous plants, the Mexican fruit salad plant, South African bird of paradise flowers, and the endangered Ginkgo biloba plant from Japan can also be found growing here. The water lily ponds used to be home to numerous North and South American freshwater turtles that were former pets. After the turtles were abandoned by their owners and thrown into the wild, biologists rescued them from Madrid’s waterways. Instead of treating them as invasive species and euthanizing them, the biologists gave the turtles a second shot at life and set them up in a fancy new home within the garden, where they wouldn’t cause any harm to members of the native Iberian ecosystems. However, in the spring of 2018, the turtles were relocated to a nearby wildlife park due to overcrowding and overpopulation of the ponds.  Paths to enter the tropical garden are closed, however you can still view this lush wonderland from the sides, and the station's uppermost floors. Entrance to the station is free.

178,Sant Pau Recinte Modernista,"Barcelona, Spain",The largest Art Nouveau complex in the world is a Barcelona hospital with a 600-year-long history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sant-pau-recinte-modernista,"Stained glass windows, arches, paintings, and mosaics illuminated by massive windows that offer natural light in buildings surrounded by impeccable landscaping and ornate statues of gargoyles and angels aren’t often indicative of hospital aesthetics. But Sant Pau in Barcelona, with a history that dates back six centuries, is a worthwhile detour from traditional medical architecture. In the late 19th century, Barcelona was expanding beyond its old city walls, and beyond the Hospital de la Santa Creuwhich had served the city since the early 1400s. In 1896 a wealthy Catalan banker named Pau Gil i Serra died, leaving behind a will that requested his estate be used for a new hospital that would utilize the newest available medical technology. A spot was chosen about two miles northeast from the old medieval hospital, which now houses the National Library of Catalonia. Catalan architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner designed the site, which would represent the merging of six of Barcelona’s hospitals. Domènech was an influential artist in Catalan Modernisme and Art Nouveau. He designed the 27-building complex that took up the equivalent of around nine city blocks to be interconnected by underground tunnels. Sixteen of the structures were built in the Modernist style and, though guidebooks and tourists often overlook the site, make up the largest Art Nouveau site in the world. The complex was finished in 1930, with each building representing a different medical specialty. The Hospital de Sant Pau was fully functioning until 2009, when a new building, erected in the northern half of the complex, took over the duties. Several of the historic buildings were refurbished over the next several years. The site, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, reopened to the public in 2014 and now serves as spaces for events, meetings, and tours of the Art Nouveau style. To this day it continues to serve its original purpose while representing an important point of reference in world architecture.",art nouveau modernism art history hospitals architecture
179,Chamberí Ghost Station,"Madrid, Spain","Abandoned for decades, trains still pass through the now-restored remains of one of Madrid's first metro stations.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chamberi-ghost-station,"Travelers on the Madrid Metro’s line 1 (the “blue” line) have probably noticed an old station flashing through the train car’s windows for a few seconds between the Bilbao and Iglesia stops. This is the now-disused Estación de Chamberí, and its history provides an instructive glimpse at the history of the Madrid Metro itself. One of eight stations on the Metro’s first line, the Chamberí station linked the nascent system to the Plaza de Chamberí above. Opened in 1919, this inaugural version of the Metro ran for four kilometers, from Cuarto Caminos to Puerta del Sol. However, this modest start would quickly become a popular and vital part of the urban landscape, expanding rapidly over the following decades to become one of the longest and most comprehensive metro systems in the world. During the turbulent years of the Spanish Civil War, the station provided shelter from the deadly bombing campaigns and artillery assaults of the Nationalist forces (and their Nazi allies) to terrified and shell-shocked Madrileños who would sleep within the station. Several diesel engines in the station were also used by the Republican government to power huge parts of the city during the war. As part of its progressive expansion, the trains on line 1 were lengthened in the 1960s. This meant the end for Chamberí. Because it was built on a curve and close to both Bilbao and Iglesia, lengthening the station’s platform proved both pointless and basically impossible. Chamberí was closed on May 22, 1966. The rails, however, were not moved, nor the trains rerouted, so it served for decades thereafter as the mystery station glimpsed by passengers on trains merely passing through. The rails and overhead electric lines continued to be maintained, but the rest of the station fell into dilapidation and disrepair. It remained, however, a sealed example of the transit systems origins, and thus rehabilitation efforts began in 2006 to transform Estación de Chamberí into a museum chronicling the history of the Madrid Metro. Opened in 2008, the museum, called Andén 0, or “Platform Zero,” features a fully restored Chamberí, complete with old ticket offices, turnstiles, maps, and a film about the building of the Metro. The main attraction, however, is found in the beautifully reconstructed original ads lining the walls of the platform, composed of tiny, brilliantly-colored tiles just as they were in 1919. Just don’t be startled by the trains that still rumble through this abandoned-station-turned-museum, separated from the exhibit area only by a clear glass barrier. Update as of January 2020: The Chamberí Ghost Station is open and free of charge.  Located on the Plaza de Chamberí, a short walk from either the Bilbao or Iglesia stop on the Metro's line 1.

Included among the latter is the Palau Mornau, a grand Renaissance-cum-modernist structure that now houses a museum—not of portraiture, or decorative arts, or even Catalan history, but of weed. The Palau Mornau was originally built in the 16th century as a city palace for the noble Santcliment family. Owned by the family for two centuries, the building was bought in the late 18th century by Josep Francesc Mornau (the “honorary war commissioner of the Royal Armies”) and later changed hands again in the early 20th century, coming under the ownership of one Joan Nadal de Vilardaga, the brother of the mayor of Barcelona. The new owner undertook a major renovation of the palace, transforming the building into a masterpiece of the Modernisme style that was changing the face of Barcelona at the time and continues to be a major architectural signature of the city. The renovation included stained glass windows, floral wrought iron balconies, a faux stone facade, and exquisite interior design that imparted every room with uniquely styled floors, ceilings, walls, and windows. By 2001, however, the building had fallen into disuse and disrepair, when it was a discovered by Ben Dronkers, a Dutch entrepreneur and philanthropist who had started Amsterdam’s Hash Marihuana & Hemp Museum in 1985. Seeking to expand the museum’s facilities and mission beyond Amsterdam, he purchased the Palau Mornau and embarked on a ten-year project of meticulous renovation – a sensitive task, given the building’s status as a national monument. Once the restoration was completed, the Hash Marihuana & Hemp Museum Barcelona opened its doors to great fanfare in May of 2012, with the grand opening featuring silver-maned real-life Tony Stark proxy and drug policy reform advocate Richard Branson. The museum’s permanent collection contains approximately 8000 objects related to cannabis cultivation and utilization throughout human history, including medicine bottles, apothecary kits, prescription bottles, paintings, pipes, sculptures, and film posters. Exhibit topics deal with not only recreational and medicinal uses of cannabis, but also industrial applications, legislative history, and the horticultural considerations of cannabis cultivation. If you prefer buildings to bud, the Palau Mornau is part of a Modernisme walking tour of Barcelona.  Children under 13 are admitted free of charge if accompanied by an adult.

Together, they form a nature reserve called Las Salinas de Torrevieja. One lake in particular stands out, as its eye-catching bubblegum pink color overshadows its green-tinted neighbor. When looking at Torrevieja from above, it looks as though a colossal strawberry milkshake melted and the gooey mess pooled just outside the city. But the odd sight isn’t caused by a slew of unnatural ingredients. It’s actually the work of bacteria and algae. Halobacterium (also known as “salt bacterium”) thrive in salty places, as does a micro-algae called Dunaliella salina. These are the two magic ingredients that concoct the lake’s bizarre hue. Despite its funky color, the water is perfectly fine, though it can get a bit smelly. Torrevieja relies on its salt lakes. People have been collecting the mineral from the waters for centuries. In the early 19th century, they officially became a hub for Spain’s salt industry. In addition to boosting the city’s economy, the lakes also act like a natural spa. Supposedly, the sludge of mud and salt at the bottom have healing properties than can relieve common skin and respiratory ailments. The water’s high salt concentration makes it a fun place to relax and enjoy floating around with ease. Flamingos, much like the local people, also frequent the pink lake.

Located in the city’s Gothic quarter, four 2,000-year-old columns from the Roman Empire’s Imperial Period are guarded by the building that houses the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya (Hiking Club of Catalonia). The temple was built to honor Emperor Augustus and once towered over the ancient Roman city of Barcino. It was constructed of sandstone from nearby Montjuïc Hill and at least partially plastered over. The 120-foot-long building was built in the first century. It was surrounded by numerous 30-foot-tall columns, but now only four remain. Most of the stones from the temple were reused for other buildings. Three of the columns remained intact, forming part of the inside of a new structure. They were found in the 15th century, but no one could figure out their origin until the 19th century, when it was discovered they were in fact the remains of a Roman temple. The fourth column was rebuilt from the remains of the other columns and erected in the Plaça del Rei (King’s Square) in 1879, where it stayed until 1956 when it was moved to the spot where it stands now, next to the original three columns, which have never been moved.

Known as “La Fábrica,” the modern-day fortress that houses Ricardo Bofill’s firm, Taller de Arquitectura, is a visual incongruence of exposed concrete and rich green flora. After purchasing the cement factory in 1973, Bofill transformed the eight spacious silos into a lofty interior for his workshop. The repurposed space houses everything from offices to libraries to the firm’s exhibition room, known reverentially as “The Cathedral.” Bofill himself resides within the factory. The grounds outside are carpeted by grass; eucalyptus, palm, olive, and plum trees grow in abundance. Climbing plants scale the various structures, lending La Fábrica the appearance of a lost industrial ruin—although nature’s seeming attempts at reclaiming the factory have been carefully encouraged by the hands of artists. The renovation draws its inspiration from the Catalan Gothic style, and also includes influences from other architectural languages. According to Bofill, while today the original cement factory has been successfully transfigured, La Fábrica will always remain an “unfinished work.” La Fábrica stands as a testament to the fact that any space can be reborn, and proves that an imaginative architect can adapt their art to even the most unexpected surroundings.",factories industrial gardens abandoned plants architecture

This street, world famous for the Picasso Museum, was once the heart of the city’s most prestigious district, where wealthy families and ennobled merchants chose to build their Gothic residences. The facade of the building dates back to the 14th century, but the palace’s Baroque architectural gems are from after it was remodeled by a wealthy merchant and nobleman Pau Ignasi Dalmases, who lived there between 1690 and 1705. During this time the palace was the meeting place of the Academy of Desconfiats (Academy of the Distrustful), a scholarly society created by a group of aristocrats in Barcelona in 1700 to study language, culture, history, literature, and philosophy. Its members, known as “Els savis del Born” (“The Wise Born”) enjoyed exquisite meetings around the palace’s cabinet of curiosities and musical instruments. Today, the historic Palau de Dalmases operates as a flamenco performance venue, but has retained some of its original treasures, such as the Baroque courtyard and the salomic columns on the staircase, on which you’ll find a frieze depicting the mythological story of Neptune’s chariot. It is one of the few civil historic landmarks of this artistic style remaining in Catalonia, as most of the monumental heritage from the era has been lost to the destruction of wars and the steady march of time.

Although it looks like ornamentation, or a small shrine of sorts, the inlet was in fact a rotating wooden, turntable used to anonymously drop off donations for the church, including unwanted infants. Originally founded in the late 16th century, the building at 17 Ramelleres became an orphanage in the 19th century. Like many other orphanages and convents at the time, a main feature of the building was its wooden turntable, which allowed the destitute to place their babies on it and anonymously spin them into the arms of a staff member inside the home. Active from 1853-1931, the turntable saw hundreds of babies come through its portal into the orphanage. Other donations were occasionally dropped off including money and groceries, but mostly, babies were left by parents that did not or could not take care of them.

There are exhibits that cycle through but many are permanent installations. A statement from the museum website explains it as so: “The MEAM is the new temple of this new religion. The religion of those who believe, in the XXI century, in Art. An Art that is not content with experimentation turned into an end in itself, or the permanent trial without reaching any definite forms, or the cult of noise by noise, or with video montages burdened by boredom. In short, an art that justifies itself as something direct, explicit, categorical, absolute, real, intelligible and brilliant.”",modernism art museums
189,Museo de las Brujas (Witches Museum),"Zugarramurdi, Spain",A museum dedicated to the Spanish occult in a town that was terrorized by the Inquisition.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/witches-museum,"The town of Zugarramurdi on the Basque border in northern Spain may be small but during the 17th century Spanish Inquisition the rural settlement was the focus of one of the largest witch trials in history which ended in the deaths of countless innocents and it is the folk beliefs and lives of these victims that are remembered in the Zugarramurdi Witch Museum. According to legend, a young woman from the town had the power to fly, and strange occult activities were held by women regularly in a cave and a meadow known as the “Akelarre” (translating as the “meadow of the he-goat” in Basque) near town. These macabre meetings were supposedly conducted and lead by a large billy goat which spoke and issued commands to the enraptured sabbath of witches who gathered. The truth of these myths cannot be proven, but in reality, these myths were powerful enough to scare the Spanish government into bringing the inquisition to the gate of Zugarramurdi. They rounded up the accused in 1610 and tried them in nearby Logroño in the largest trial of its kind in history. Over 7,000 individual cases were tried, mainly focusing on the woman accused, although plenty of men and children were included as well. 53 individuals were found guilty of practicing witchcraft. Many of them were marched to prisons and died along the way, while others were quickly burned at the stake. Years of non-superstitious beliefs later, all the alleged witchcraft was deemed traditional folk medicine and the Inquisition was deemed an atrocity. Ever since the trials, Zugarramurdi has been associated with witchcraft and today the town embraces its pagan heritage with such sites as the witch museum. The museum, which is housed in the town’s former hospital, was established in 2007 and features a number of displays illustrating both the reality and myth surrounding the local witches. There are “floating” dresses and cauldrons and goats heads on display, giving the proper due to the folk beliefs of the area and also the misconceptions of the witches. In contrast, there are also displays exploring the role of the female herbalist which was most often associated with witchcraft. There is also a film explaining the process behind the 1610 trials. The Zugarramurdi Witch Museum also takes part in the annual celebration of the summer solstice held in the nearby caves. The town seems to have taken back its identity not by distancing itself from its historic tragedy, but by embracing its legacy, warts and all.",occult witchcraft collections museums and collections

Housed in its current location since 1781 in a building designed by the same architectural team responsible for the Museo del Prado, the botanical garden was initially populated with over 2,000 specimens retrieved from all over the Iberian peninsula by botanist and surgeon José Quer. After implausibly surviving centuries worth of civil and international wars, the collection has expanded to over 90,000 flowers and plants (not counting its herbarium with a literal million specimens on its own) plus an estimated 1,500 trees. Originally arranged according to the Linneaus method favored during the period, in which the specimens are categorized in terraces of import, today its expansive grounds have been rearranged in a fashion that makes more sense. Visitors will find the Real Jardín Botanico has been divided into seven outdoor gardens and five indoor greenhouses. Each of these sections are arranged logically by theme, content, and nature of origin. Highlights include the “Terraza de Cuadros” – featuring a Japanese garden and a series of box-edged plots filled with medicinal, aromatic, and orchard-like plants arranged around a fountain – and a romantic, period-accurate garden arranged to echo an English garden bursting with trees and shrubs.  A beautiful and cryptic stelae by the Catalan sculptor, Frederico Mares is hidden away among the foliage and portrays some Iberian maidens taming a wild stallion. Perhaps most fascinatingly of all, one of Real Jardín Botánico’s greenhouses has the ability to recreate the desert climate, making it one of the very few places where visitors can experience an accurate desert experience without leaving continental Europe.",botanical gardens flora gardens plants
192,Parc Garrell,"Argelaguer, Spain",Wonderland replication in progress by one persistent man.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laberinth-of-josep-pujiula,"Josep Pujiula i Vila was at odds with the government. The former Spanish textile worker had actually been in opposition to the government for over 30 years, since he began working on creating his own amazing city out of natural landscape. In 1980, Pujiula i Vila began by crafting a labyrinth alongside the Fluvia, a river in Catalonia, Spain. After creating his initial labyrinth, he began to make other structures in the area as well. Pujiula made towers out of branches and trees stretching 30 meters into the air. He coiled wood into tube-like tunnels and walkways and he even made a small livable cabin. As his world grew,  the community took notice. Families came there with their children to solve the labyrinth and wander through the woodsy environment. Sadly, there were not only curious visitors to his creation. Along with wonderstruck children and their parents, came homeless people sleeping in the cabin, vandals and worst of all, the Spanish government. Inspecting the area, which was built on public land, the government quickly deemed Pujiula i Vila’s homemade park a dangerous environment. Over growing concern for visitor safety, he was pushed toward dismantling his work. Although safety was seen as a pretext for government action on the land, officials also wanted to use the land to create a new highway. In 2002, they got their wish and Pujiula i Vila took apart his creation to make room for government roads. While he was beaten by the government fair and square, he refused to give up. Shortly after, he began to create a similar site near his previous work. Although not quite as grand as his wonderland, he never gave up on his dream. Slowly, he worked to rebuild it, and a masterful tubed walkway and tower stand as a monument to his perseverance and architectural skill. Pujiula i Vila passed in June 2016. Since, some of his works have been taken down. The labyrinth still retains many fantastical tower structures, walkways, and tunnels full of creepy items and carvings.  Follow the signs guiding to ""Parc Garrell,"" which is another name for this place. The main labyrinth is no longer here, but a smaller version remains near the signs.

It took four years to finish. Recently renovated, it was once considered one of the most dangerous pathways in the world, regularly drawing visitors hoping to cross it. Twenty years after the pathway was completed, King Alfonso XIII crossed the pathway for the inauguration of a new dam. This led to the pathway’s modern name, “The King’s Little Pathway,” or “El Caminito Del Rey.” After the King’s crossing, however, the bridge began to fall into disrepair. The path itself runs 100 meters above the river below and is only 1 meter wide. It has no handrails and some of the concrete path has fallen down the gorge, leaving only a steel beam left in place. Before the trail was renovated, there was a cable running the length of the path which one could clip onto. However, the integrity of this cable was unknown. Between 1999 and 2000, four deaths occurred due to the instability of the path. In March 2014 restoration works were started jointly by the regional government of Andalusia and the local government of Malaga. The Caminito del Rey is now fully renovated and safe to walk on, but your time slot to walk the length must be pre-booked on the attraction website.  The pathway is located about 60 miles south of Cordoba and just 3 miles from the small town of El Chorro.Parking is available very near the start of the site from unofficial sites from around €4. Tickets are available at the starting point for €10. Total walk length is 5 km and is fairly easy. A bus is available for the return trip for around €1.70 and is well worth it. Opening hours differ across the seasons, with longer hours during the warm season, so check the official website to plan accordingly. Also, keep in mind El Caminito del Rey route is linear, stretching from north to south, so visitors need to organize transportation both to the start and endpoint.",ruins

Not far from the Fallen Angel of Parque del Buen Retiro, is a far less graceful interpretation of a fall from Heaven. Sculptor Miguel Ángel Ruiz Beato’s “Air Crash” takes the falling part quite literally. The sculpture of an angel mid-crash isn’t meant to depict Lucifer though, just a winged man who, according to Beato, went for a long walk and flew home with his back to the ground, sunbathing. While he was gone a city had been erected on the bare meadow where he usually landed. The bronze angel crash-landed in January 2005. Most locals and tourists are unaware of Beato’s narrative for the 600-pound angel. There are, however, a few prevailing theories of just who it’s supposed to be: Lucifer, Icarus, or even Led Zeppelin’s Swan Song Angel.  Milaneses, 3 street.

Junyent’s fame stemmed from his design work for the Gran Teatre de Liceu’s operas. The most important was Parsifal by Wagner, performed in Barcelona in 1913 for the first time outside Germany. Following his success in the theatre, he decorated some of Barcelona’s most luxurious bourgeois houses, including Casa Burés and Casa Cambó. He was also leader Catalonia’s modernism movement, a contemporary of Ramon Casas and Pablo Picasso. The Junyent family still resides in the building, but they have opened Oleguer’s preserved workshop to the public for scheduled viewings. The collection is a sight to behold: In addition to Oleguer’s paintings, sculptures, models, and various other works, it contains one of the most complete collections of automata in the city after the Tibidabo Amusement Park. Its fashion collection is also incredibly robust. In addition to costumes designed by Junyent, it contains historical artifacts from the rococo, romantic, and art deco periods. Some of the paintings in the collection are masterpieces, from the medieval works by Ferrer Bassa to the avant-gardist Anglada Camarassa. The workshop also displays a series of dolls collected by Oleguer’s niece.

That event changed her life forever. Ángeles Rodríguez Hidalgo was a humble woman who, when widowed at 41, worked two jobs to raise her five children. She lived in the working-class Madrid neighborhood of Vallecas, where heavy metal music was popular with young people in the 1980s. But Rodríguez Hidalgo was not exactly a young lady when she decided to go to a rock concert with her grandson at age 70. She did, though, like it so much that after that she never missed a chance to attend a metal show and became a beloved figure of the ’80s rock scene in Madrid. Over time “la abuela rockera” (“the rocker grandma”) came to collaborate with radio and TV shows and even had her own column in Heavy Rock magazine. Her image was featured on the cover of the album “Toca Madera” by the heavy band Panzer, showing her clad in leather and giving the metal horns sign. In 1999, six years after Rodríguez Hidalgo’s death, artist Carmen Jorba created a bronze sculpture of the rocker grandma, hand held high, recreating the image from the Panzer album. At one point, some vandals broke off the statue’s devil horn fingers and for several years grandma’s hand seemed to depict the communist symbol. It’s since been repaired, and now stands in all its metal splendor, a rare tribute to an unexpected pop culture personality.  The sculpture is situated in the neighborhood of Vallecas.

The giant machine is used to perform the massively complex calculations involved in such fields of research as human genome mapping, astrophysics, and weather prediction. Physically the computer consists of a number of black computing stacks that are all encased in a giant glass box, which itself sits in the romantically-styled main hall of Torre Girona. Rebuilt after the Spanish Civil War, the Torre Girona is a 19th century church that sits on the campus of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. The space was used as a Catholic church until at least 1960, when it was deconsecrated.

This beach alone proves that Mother Nature had a fondness for flying buttresses eons before any human engineer patted himself on the back for coming up with the now-iconic architectural feature. Officially called the Praia de Augas Santas or “Beach of the Holy Waters,” the beach is more often referred to by the name locals use for its halls of natural wonder: La Playa de las Catedrales, or “Beach of the Cathedrals.” So named in honor of the extraordinary natural rock formations resembling the soaring arches found in Gothic cathedrals, the unusual geology along this particular stretch of coastline gains all the more magic for the fact that its glory is only revealed at low tide. As the waters recede, a vista of natural arches, cliffs, and sea caves are revealed. The arches themselves reach 90 feet in height, while deep, eroded caves stretch back into the cliffside. Connecting all these features are sandy patches formed by the schist and slate of the rocks themselves. Playa de Catedrales has become a popular destination for those who feel a more holy kinship with nature, or seek to experience a touch of the divine in a new, unexpected setting. Strolling among these rocky outcroppings and exploring all these nooks and crannies at low tide is encouraged, though keeping a vigilant eye turned toward the returning sea is a must. Thanks to the region’s extremely planar coastline, the ocean can, at times, return alarmingly quickly, for once high tide has come, all traces of the cathedrals and those basking in their glory will be inundated until the cycle starts anew, revealing the secrets lying beneath their waves. From 2015 there is a limit in the number of visitors allowed per day. You can get your reservation, here: https://ascatedrais.xunta.es/monatr/inicio?lang=es.
Due to the tourism boom that this beach experiences, the authorities limited the visitors daily to less than five thousand. Therefore, it is recommended to visit the Cathedral's beach in winter or during the shoulder seasons (spring and autumn).

Among the 1,500-odd pieces on display are deformed skulls of ancient cultures, severed heads from executions, dissected fetuses, uncorrupted children’s skeletons, diseased bones, and torture devices like the real garrote vil that killed the famous Madrid serial killer, “Jarabo.” There are many other macabre and grisly objects, like weapons made by inmates, pre-Columbian Andean and Egyptian mummies, fetishes, amulets, antique pharmaceuticals, a toxicology display of poisonous plants and animals, and a collection of some 800 skulls. But the intention of the museum is not attract the morbid attention of people. Rather, it’s to offer to students, and anyone interested in the subject matter, real and direct contact with the tools and history of forensic medicine and criminal studies.

Stretching for 1.5 miles with over 80 towers and 9 gates, these stone walls have been incredibly well-preserved over the centuries, and are considered among the finest medieval walls in all Europe. The 11th and 12th centuries were turbulent times in Spain, marked by an escalation in the war of attrition between the Almohad Islamic Caliphate of southern Spain and the northern Christian Kingdom of Asturias. Peace treaties were drawn and territories demarcated, but tensions between the two regional powers would inevitably heighten across the Iberian Peninsula and explode into violence. For centuries the province of Ávila was something of a buffer zone and no man’s land between the two regions, called the “Desierto del Duero” (“Desert of the Duero”), and whenever conflict sparked between the two powers the area would become a battlefield. But by the 11th century, the no man’s land was becoming repopulated as the Christian kingdoms pushed farther south and began to resettle areas that had been long abandoned due to conflict. This burgeoning population faced a constant threat of attack and siege, and so giant fortifications were built up enclosing the city within. Some 900 years later, these magnificent walls look much as they did during the Middle Ages, and they continue to define the city of Ávila.  You can walk on top of about half of the length of the walls, and climb some of the turrets to take in the view of the city.

According to this thesis, the “Museu de Carrosses Fúnebres de Barcelona” represents not just the uses and customs that the Spanish dedicated to funerary ceremonies during the last third of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, but the mindset of the Spanish people themselves. Apart from the funerary carriages, a series of different horse-drawn escort vehicles that accompanied the hearses are on view, and represent the forbearers of the current escort vehicles used for funerals, the black sedan in horse form. Amongst these one grand carriage stands out, entirely lined in black fabric, which was used by the widows. This gloomy funerary ambience was meant to induce a state of mourning, which–considering they were widows–wouldn’t seem to need inducing. The Museum is overflowing with iconographic displays of mortality, which apart from being represented by the Christian Cross, are present in all the carriages illustrating the diverse manners that the transition between life and death is exemplified. Among the symbols are the Greek letters alpha and omega reflecting the beginning and end, many sculpted angels along with stained glass and hourglasses reflecting the limitation of man’s life. Quite common as well is the figure of the owl, which on one hand represents solitude and silence, as death itself; and, on the other hand, wisdom, which linked to the Greek Goddess Athena, presupposes that man encounters true wisdom in the transition between death and the beyond. One thing which ties all the carriages together is the baroque rococo beauty with which they ushered the dead to their final resting places.

Orrius is in the autonomous community of Catalonia, and located in Spain’s northeast, near Barcelona and along the Mediterranean coast. Its mysterious forest may be one of the region’s most magical, or at least mystifying places. Many say that the forest is haunted. Entering the forest of Orrius is like stepping into a world of goblins, monsters, and covens. As you follow the forest trail, you’ll come upon figures carved in rock. Many resemble the famous heads of Easter Island, though there are also other shapes, such as a giant elephant. Local artists are said to have created the sculptures, and indeed, you can see signatures on a stone near the Elephant. The carvings and arrangement of figures implies some mystical or mythological factors at play—elements of space and boundary, earth and deity. Perhaps the figures are the entrance to another realm. Some certainly seem to think so. The remains of animals have been found in the forest, suggesting possible sacrificial rituals. Some people believe the forest is home to gnomes or dwarves, who live in or below the different stone structures. There’s even a strange rock with a small door, where a few people can squeeze inside. If you’re in Barcelona and want to make a short escape from the city to search for an alternate realm, the enchanted forest of Orrius awaits.

It was built between 1895 and 1897, and though it is one of Gaudí’s relatively understated works, it still features his signature elements of architectural fantasy. When Güell (whose name also appears on the architect’s more famous projects) originally commissioned the complex, he intended for it to include multiple hunting pavilions along with the winery. Even though the hunting lodges never came to fruition, Count Güell still made good use of the grounds. He made wine  that was exported to Cuba and served on the Compañía Transatlántica Española shipping fleet until its production stopped in 1936.

Opened in 1974, the museum was designed by Dalí himself who wanted the space to recreate the experience of entering one of his dreamlike works. To this end, many of the doorways are painted like giant, misshapen mouths and the halls of the gallery are filled with odd works by the artist. The corridors are filled with strange attractions such as a car full of plants and snails that rains inside (the secret is a semi-hidden coin slot that makes the water work), and a room with furniture designed to look like Mae West’s face when viewed at the right angle. Of course the museum is also home to many of Dalí’s most famous paintings. The exterior of the building is easily as impressive as the interior with the strange site of massive eggs crowning the main outer wall and a large geodesic dome rising up beyond those. The wall itself is dotted with loaves of bread that look like irregular flagstones.

The first, and the more obviously macabre phase, consisted of numerous sculptures of skulls, some large, some tall, some suspended like scarecrows on long poles, others almost hidden away in the shrubs. They are made of metal mesh, interwoven with the branches of a local plant, tanner’s sumach (Rhus coriaria). This was stretched over a base of plaster, and then painted white and black to make them look like skulls. The second phase is the more recent one, and less obviously morbid but nevertheless filled with a subtext to make any viewer question their mortality. It consists of a series of vehicles, from cars to baby carriages, in varying states of destruction. Attached to them are plaques with messages such as “Death likes cars” and “when I’m an adult I want to be a football player, destiny permitting.” The sum effect of the various works scattered throughout the park is to offer up a certain wistful meditation on the inevitability, and the surprise, of death. Many of the older art pieces have since fallen into decay. Some of the photos of the artist working in the park show him building pieces that are no longer there. The artist complained in an interview in 2006 that visitors to the park would sometimes jump on top of them and damage or harm them. Vidal dedicated the project to his brother Miguel, who died in 1991. Since the artist’s own death in 2008, it does not appear that anyone is continuing to add any work or repairing the pieces that are already there, adding a gloomy air of decay to an already eerie area.  From street level in Estella (Calle los Cordeleros), it’s about a 2 km walk, most of it uphill. Entry is free. The park is open 24 hours, with only a worn-down black metal fence protecting it. It’s possible to drive up the hills past rustic Navarrese cottages, but the last part has to be done on foot. The signs on the trail leading up to the fence are either no longer standing or few and far between, so it requires some tenacity and luck to get there. When you get to a fork in the dirt path that indicates a 12th-century ruined church to the left and the park to the right, you’re close.",outsider art statues
208,Dolmen de Dalí,"Madrid, Spain",The only urban monument in the world designed by the great surrealist painter Salvador Dalí.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dolmen-salvador-dali-square,"Few people realize that when they walk through the plaza at the end of Felipe II Avenue in Madrid they are passing one of the only monumental squares designed by the great Catalan artist Salvador Dalí. The square is marked with a sculptural monument dedicated to science and technology, centered around a figure of Isaac Newton placed in front of a giant dolmen. In 1985, the Madrid City Council took the initiative to dedicate a public space in the city to Dalí, and commissioned the surrealist artist to create a work for the space. Several meetings between Dalí and representatives of the city took place in Figueras, where Dalí lived. Finally he gave his consent to the project, and created two sketches. In the agreement, it was stipulated that the square would adopt the name “Salvador Dalí” and in it a monumental complex called “El Dolmen de Dalí” would be erected. The stone dolmen, built in granite and rising 43 feet tall, is formed by an oval-shaped natural rock placed horizontally on three carved granite pillars. The bronze sculpture represents an abstract, masculine figure standing on a cubic pedestal of polished black granite. The figure is holding a pendulum, with another one hanging within the hollow chest. This work is an adaptation of a 1969 Dalí sculpture titled “Homage to Newton,” which in turn is based on a small image represented in his 1949 painting “Phosphene de Laporte.” On each of the pedestal’s four faces is a carved letter, composing the name “Gala,” Dalí’s wife and inspirational muse.  Salvador Dalí's Square and the monument are located at the end of Felipe II Avenue (Avenida de Felipe II) in the Salamanca District.

Erected in the Old Quarter of Sevilla amidst historic and beautiful buildings, a gigantic, modern interpretation of wooden mushrooms didn’t quite seem to fit. Despite the initial uproar, citizens and visitors of Sevilla have come to embrace the wooden landmark. At a staggering size of 150 by 70 meters and 26 meters high, the Parasol dominates the landscape around the city center. Made entirely out of wood, it is the world’s largest wooden structure. Created out of 8,000 timber pieces and connected with steel and glue, the structure is an architectural nightmare that yielded a magnificent and dreamlike result. The entire complex was finally opened in April 2011 and cost a whopping $130 million USD. Given its size, the Parasol, also referred to as Encarnacion’s Mushrooms, serves a variety of purposes. The Metropol Parasol also commonly known as Las Setas, meaning “wild mushrooms” because of its form. The basement floor houses a museum of ancient Roman and Moorish artifacts and the ground floor hosts a lively Central Market. Along with the pleasures of food and history below the wooden mushrooms, the truly amazing levels of the structure are the terraces high above the ground. The terraced walkways on the 2nd and 3rd levels of the structure offer stunning views of the city and the ability to walk eye level along the ancient buildings of the Old Quarter.

While its exact construction date has been difficult to pin down due to the absence of any sort of inscription, the aqueduct (and aqueduct bridge) is generally believed to have been constructed around 1st or 2nd century A.D. Many of the magnificent aqueducts of the Roman Empire have disintegrated leaving only ruins and piers to mark their existence. Of the few still standing, Segovia’s is not only remarkably well-preserved, it continued to supply water to the city from the Frio River well into the 20th century. Roughly 2,950 ft. long and at its highest point almost 94 ft. tall, the aqueduct bridge is made up of 167 arches supported by pillars. Its colossal granite blocks are joined without use of mortar or clamps, ingeniously held together by balancing forces. The design follows the guidelines laid out by Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius in his 15 B.C. multi-volume architecture guide, De Architectura, written for Vitruvius’s generous patron, Julius Caesar. Nicknamed “Puente de Diablo” or Devil’s Bridge due to a local legend detailing Lucifer’s part in the construction of the bridge to impress a lady friend, the aqueduct is arguably best enjoyed at Azoguejo square, where its pillars are at their highest point. A towering symbol of Segovia, the aqueduct is an extraordinary illustration of the marriage between the grandiose beauty and ingenious functionality that defined the architecture of ancient Rome. In the shadows of the aqueduct you can find a replica of the bronze sculpture of the Capitoline, the she-wolf that in ancient Roman mythology suckled and raised the founders of Rome, Romulus and Remulus.",ancient technology aqueducts engineering ancient architectural oddities architecture

The bridge was originally built over the Llobregat River in 1283 over a former Roman bridge, the remains of which can still be seen around the current bridge, including a triumphal arch. If it doesn’t seem quite right for medieval times, the bridge was actually destroyed in 1939 during the Spanish Civil War and rebuilt in 1965. However, much of it is still the original stone. It’s not clear where it gets its “Devil’s Bridge” title, although it’s likely due to its curious architecture that seems to not be built by human hands. However, it was, and just required a little ingenuity. The highest arch has an opening 145 feet high and is quite thin, but the little chapel-shaped building at the top is actually keeping it stable. It also was likely handy for once taking tolls between the two old towns.",devils bridge bridges natural wonders nature architectural oddities architecture

According to popular belief, during the 17th century (and before) these wide rock enclosures were witness to bonfires, wild parties, and other generally pagan festivities staged by the town locals and directed by a large black billy goat known in Basque as the “Akerra.” The caves themselves were formed by the Olabidea stream which is said to originate in Hell itself, which may be where the stories of witchcraft began. However, the haunting space could easily be taken for a hotbed of black magic via its atmosphere alone. Whether true or not, the caves and the town of Zugarramurdi caught the attention of the Spanish Inquisition’s witch hunters who investigated the area and identified a number of citizens who were tried at the largest witch trial in history (over 7,000 cases were seen). A number of the accused were put to death and the town and its large caves were forever associated with the dark arts. Today the town embraces this legacy and in addition to establishing a Witch Museum, the town holds a raucous yearly feast in the Cave of Zugarramurdi. Every year, around the time of the summer solstice (a pagan holiday) scores of lamb are roasted on spits in the traditional manner, and bonfires are lit in and around the cave. Hundreds of people flock to the event to celebrate the area’s supposed occult history, and thankfully not one of them is burned at the stake.",witches witchcraft festivals caves ecosystems

His tomb is held aloft by four allegorical figures representing the four kingdoms of Spain during Columbus’ life, Castille, Aragon, Navara, and Leon. The tomb was one of the last additions to the cathedral, installed in 1899. It was designed by the sculptor Arturo Melida, and was originally installed in Havana before being moved to Seville after Spain lost control of Cuba. Columbus’ body began its final rest in Valladolid Spain, where he died in 1506, and was moved shortly thereafter to Seville, by orders of his surviving brother, Diego. In 1542, the remains were again moved, this time to Colonial Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic, where they were installed in the newly completed Cathedral of Santa Maria. There they remained for a couple of centuries. Then, in 1795 when Spain lost control of the Dominican Republic, they were moved again to Havana, Cuba. 100 years later, they made their final voyage back home to Seville, and placed in the cathedral where you can visit him today. Unfortunately, after all that effort, in 1877 a very suspicious box was discovered back in Santo Domingo inscribed with the words “The illustrious and excellent man, Don Colon, Admiral of the Ocean Sea.” That box is now contained in the massive “Faro a Colon” Lighthouse in Santo Domingo. Despite examinations and a recent DNA test of the remains in Seville, the question remains somewhat unsolved or completely resolved, depending on whom you ask.

Inhabited for over 1000 years, the town’s narrow streets still carry the characteristics of its medieval origin, and the city center features ramparts that fortified the town during the civil war. Many houses and streets in the city center are also built of the dark, volcanic rock that serves as a pedestal for the town. The main street of Castellfollit winds through the entire town narrowly pressed between houses on both sides, straining to remain on the cliff face. From its peak on the layered, volcanic formation, the town offers stunning views.

Built directly into the rocky cliffs surrounding the town, its whitewashed houses melt into the rolling hills of Andalucía. It is only a town of 3,000 people, but Setenil de Las Bodegas has played an important role throughout Spanish history. There is record of people living in the town since the Roman invasion 2000 years ago. Although inhabited, Setenil de Las Bodegas was not developed until the 12th century by the Moors, who used the cliffs as natural protection to fortify the city. During the Christian Reconquest, the Moors held the city against repeated Spanish attacks. According to some translations, Setenil de Las Bodegas refers to seven attacks from the Spanish on the town. The Moors withstood six, and finally lost the cliff-side stronghold on the seventh. Other translations hold that the name refers to the underground storage facilities used to hold the locally produced wine, which has become a major tourist draw to the quiet town. Whatever the translation, most travelers make their way to Setenil de Las Bodegas for the rocky setting. Boulders hang precariously between many of the winding streets, often creating natural roofs for the homes and stores. Most amazingly, one large overhang covers an entire block of white houses, providing shade and natural cooling during warm summers in southern Spain. Even more remarkable are homes built on top of the overhang, giving the town layers of houses separated by natural rock formation.

The current Gothic structure was built around 1342, but it’s believed that a Christian church has sat on this site since 300 CE, and that even before that it was a place of pagan worship. It’s believed this ancient church may have originally been a shrine to Castor and Pollux, twin figures of Greco-Roman mythology. As Barcelona became a Catholic city over the centuries, the twins may have evolved into or been conflated with Justus and Pastor, two Christian boys beheaded by the Roman Emperor Diocletian for refusing to deny their faith in 304 CE. The relics of the boy martyrs are now venerated at the Barcelona basilica, which is offered up to them and “La Moreneta,” the Black Madonna. She is the patron saint of Catalonia, and is also believed by some to be based on an ancient source, the Egyptian goddess Isis. The clashing architectural styles of the church are a result of its long history. Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Neolassical elements all mingle to create a unique atmosphere outside of time and place. It was promoted to the rank of minor basilica by Pope Pius XII in 1946. Interestingly, the Basilica also held significant political power. After retaking Barcelona from the Moors in 801, King Louis the Pious declared that a last will and testament made by any king inside the church was a legally binding document. This was later extended to anyone inside the church, and was not repealed until 1991. Combatants preparing to duel would also swear on a Bible in the basilica that they would fight fairly.

Luckily for us, Juan de la Cosa, who sailed with Columbus on three journeys, did - leaving us with the oldest known map showing America. De la Cosa was the captain of the Santa Maria, and later, after she was shipwrecked, the master of the Marigalante, and finally sailed on La Nina. He also “explored” (and with the brutal conquistadors conquered the indigenous inhabitants) the lands of Colombia and Panama with Vasco Nunez de Balboa. He returned to Spain with his famous map, but died in the New World after being fatally shot by indigenous peoples (who his group had previously attacked)  with poisoned arrows in Turbaco, Colombia in 1509. Drawn in or around the year 1500, this early style of map is known as a “mappa mundi” or “world map.” Maps like this were highly valuable pieces of maritime information, each new map adding to the store of knowledge that kept ships from wrecking on uncharted hazards. They were also closely guarded state secrets, as they held the keys for one nations superiority over another in maritime trade and colonialism. De la Cosa’s map incorporates older information as well as the recent voyages of Vasco de Gama to India in 1498. Drawn on ox-hide, it measures 72” x 37 1/2”. The map was unknown before 1832 when it was discovered in a Paris shop by the French scientist and map enthusiast Charles Walckenaer. It is thought that the map had been taken from the Secret Archives at the Vatican in 1810 by Napoleon, and found its way into a bookshop after his fall. After Walckenaer’s death in 1853, the map was bought by the queen of Spain, and brought back to Madrid. In 1839 Walckenaer went on to become the conservator of maps for the Department of Maps at the Royal Library in Paris.",dead explorers marvelous maps and measures

Witches’ Sabbath (The Great He-Goat) is one of the haunting “Black Paintings” artist Francisco Goya created during the later years of his life. Goya, who by then was nearly deaf and suffering from profound depression, retreated into the isolation of his studio and covered his walls with these macabre masterpieces. This particular creation is a deeply disturbing painting that has the power to shock, even though it is centuries old. The large brooding figure of a black-cloaked billy goat sits wreathed in shadow at the forefront of the painting bleating something known only to the painter’s mind to an enraptured audience of crones, some of whom are bowing reverently and others that whisper in muffled agreement. It should come as no surprise to most that the goat, or the Gran Cabrón as Goya named him, symbolically represents the figure of the devil and that the crones are actually a sabbath of witches. But what can escape the viewer is that this haunting painting is not actually meant to be taken literally as a depiction of the supernatural. This is because this masterpiece is, in fact, thought to be a satirical criticism of what Goya saw as the ugly and dark side of the human condition and the depravity of post-Napoleonic war society that surrounded him.  The painting can be found in the lower floors of the museum in room 067. To avoid the frustration of long lines and waits to enter, not to mention the steep entrance fee, it's a good idea to visit the museum on a Sunday between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. when it is not only free, but there are fewer people.",goats art history witches witchcraft art museum paintings murals art

Tolkien fever dream, Spain’s Castillo de Zafra sits atop a regal promontory in a setting that may as well be populated with roaming dragons. Built back around the 12th and 13th centuries, the stunning castle has been passed around amongst the Spanish nobility for hundreds of years. The tall towers of the castle sit atop a massive rock located on what was once the border between Christian and Muslim territories. The flat surface atop the rock is crowned with a high defensive wall that makes accessing the castle inconvenient even for those who live lived there. By the 15th century, the castle had come under siege by a Castillian king who was fighting with the then owner of the castle. But unsurprisingly the imposing defense held. The castle has been owned by a long list of noblemen, some of whom repaired or expanded the grounds. There are even rumors of secret rooms that were carved into the rock beneath the structures. While these have never been found, Castillo de Zafra absolutely looks like the type of castle that would have them. By the modern day, the towers and buildings had been badly damaged and many were crumbling. But thanks to restoration efforts by the castle’s 20th-century owner, Don Antonio Sanz Polo, it once again looks like something out of fantasy. Today the Castillo de Zafra is privately owned and anyone wishing to tour the castle grounds must get permission to enter the premises, and it is said that the only way in is by climbing a ladder.

For approximately five thousand years, copper, gold, silver and other minerals have been mined along the river, with dissolving iron giving it a strange reddish hue. The Red River is often considered the birthplace of both the Copper Age and Bronze Age. The Iberians and Tartessians in the area began mining the river in 3000 BCE, followed by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors. For hundreds of years, the river’s mines were abandoned until rediscovered and operated by the Spanish government in 1724. After large-scale excavations by companies from the United Kingdom in the 19th century made the river extremely dangerous for people because of the high acidity level, the multinational Rio Tinto Company was formed to operate the mines. Rio Tinto no longer manages the river, but by the end of the 20th century it had become one of the world’s largest mining companies. The high acidity keeps people away from the waters, but draws scientists in. Extremophile aerobic bacteria in the water provide conditions similar to those found in other areas in the solar system. Jupiter’s moon Europa, for example, is thought to contain an acidic ocean underneath its surface. Life in the Rio Tinto - the bacteria feed on iron and sulfide minerals in the river’s subsurface rocks - make the likelihood of life on Europa all the more possible. The river reaches the Gulf of Cadiz at Huelva.

The underwater museum, the first of its kind in Europe, is situated off the coast of the Spanish island of Lanzarote, the easternmost of the Canary Islands. The oceanic exhibition is meant to send a message about conservation, exploring how to create an ecologically responsible interaction between humans and ocean life. The sculptures, created by British artist Jason deCaires Taylor, illustrate the impact of people’s behavior on the environment: Some feature a raft of refugees on an uncertain voyage; others show humans posing for selfies or taking pictures. Taylor has also built artificial reefs that marine microorganisms attach to, which both attracts more coral growth and helps protect delicate natural coral reefs. The concrete in the sculptures is pH-neutral and nontoxic to marine life, meaning it serves as the perfect base for microorganisms to inhabit and form artificial reefs where biodiversity skyrockets in once-barren areas. Seventy sculptures are already in place, and by the completion of the ten phases of installations it’s anticipated that number will bubble up to around 300.

Witnessing the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, conquest by the Vandals and the Moors, the unification of the Spain, and the proxy war that presaged World War II, Esco was ultimately abandoned due to an act of civil engineering. Built in 1959, the Yesa Dam was constructed to create a supply of irrigation and drinking water for the surrounding area. The resulting reservoir flooded the farmlands of Esco (as well as the nearby towns of Ruesta and Tiermas), leaving the inhabitants with poor prospects for the future. As a result, the village was abandoned in 1960. However, unlike Ruesta and Tiermas, Esco was not completely abandoned; today, four people still live in Esco, keeping flocks of sheep in the grazing lands that are still accessible above the town. They make their homes among the town’s three streets and 60 houses that continue to decay and collapse into ruin. Additionally, the village church of San Miguel still stands.

When the governor banned gambling in 1912, Casino de la Rebassada quickly fell into disrepair, and after progressive decline was finally closed and abandoned in the 1930s. Used as a bomb shelter and barracks during the civil war, the collection of ruined buildings—most now partially destroyed and overgrown by the woodlands—is rumored by locals to be haunted by the ghosts of revolutionaries who were allegedly tortured and killed in this out-of-town location. It is suggested that it has stayed unrestored as nobody wants to dig in the building grounds or surrounding area for fear of the atrocities committed and buried here.

Yet right behind this important artery of the city of Madrid, there is a church whose austere façade reveals no clue as to the spectacularly beautiful baroque interior. Inside the church, the domed ceiling and the walls are richly decorated with frescoes, leading it to be dubbed “the Sistine Chapel of Madrid.” The elaborate frescoes depict the life and miracles of the titular saint of the church, St. Anthony of Padua. Built in the 17th century, this church initially served as a hospital for Portuguese citizens who came to Madrid while Portugal was under Spanish rule. After Portuguese independence, it was dedicated to German pilgrims and its name was changed to the current name, Iglesia de San Antonio de los Alemanes (Church of Saint Anthony of the Germans). Around 1660, the church’s dome began to be painted according to sketches by the Italian artists Coloma and Mitelli. The frescoes were started two years later, painted by Carreño de Miranda and Francisco de Rizzi, commissioned King Felipe IV of Spain. A fresco of St. Anthony of Padua, a Franciscan born in Lisbon in 1195, occupies the most important place in the dome. He is depicted kneeling on a cloud receiving the Child Jesus and Virgin Mary with open arms. The different miracles of the saint are represented along the entire upper level of the church, while several sainted kings from history are represented below them. Under the church, there is a curious crypt with several niches that house corpses of the Spanish royal family, some dating back to the Middle Ages. Nearby there are more niches, where children and some unknown bodies were laid to rest.  The nearest tube station is Gran Via.

227,Street Performers of Las Ramblas,"Barcelona, Spain","The iconic boulevard is the perfect place to catch sight of a bicycling skeleton, a levitating Satan, or a chef with his head stuck in a pizza.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/street-performers-of-las-ramblas,"While walking down Las Ramblas in Barcelona, it’s quite normal to see the head of a chef in a pizza, an angel, a man covered in scrap, a demoness from mythology, a moving skeleton on a bicycle, Galileo Galilei, or a man on a toilet, not to mention a levitating Satan, people coated in mud, a guy who has lost his head, a devil in the trunk, and the Grim Reaper. Once the site of a monastery and a university, the stretch is now Barcelona’s busking center. Human statues, who patiently transform themselves into mythical creatures or famous figures from history with the help of elaborate makeup and attire, spend hours frozen in place, or break the position to perform for and interact with the gathered crowds. This iconic boulevard, stretching for a nearly a mile, is the perfect stage for street performers to capture the attention of tourists and locals with their quirky costumes and acts. While strolling along and watching this live art unfold, visitors can also walk across a piece of art by the famous Spanish artist Joan Miró, a huge circular street mosaic in the primary colors. It was created in 1967, and restored by the government for its 30th anniversary.",performances cities statues art
228,'El Petó de la Mort' ('The Kiss of Death'),"Barcelona, Spain","A cemetery in Barcelona's Poblenou district is home to this touching funerary statue, which depicts death in the form of a winged skeleton.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-kiss-of-death-east-cemetery,"Alongside guardian angels and other typical funerary sculptures that adorn mausoleums in Poblenou Cemetery stands a striking sculpture. This finely-detailed carving stands out for its expressiveness and sense of macabre; It depicts a winged skeleton taking the life of a young man by way of a tender kiss. Known as el Petó de la Mort (the Kiss of Death), the sculpture was created in 1930 for the tomb of textile manufacturer Josep Llaudet Soler. The tomb is inscribed with a line verse by the Catalan poet Jacinto Verdaguer that translates to: “His young heart is thus extinguished. The blood in his veins grows cold. And all strength has gone. Faith has been extolled by his fall into the arms of death. Amen.” The masterful sculpting on el Petó de la Mort has made it a celebrated piece of funerary art. Delicate details carved into the marble capture both soft skin and the bony fingers of death. The piece is believed to have been sculpted by Jaume Barba, the artist whose name is carved into the base of the monument, though some have attributed its design to another artist, Joan Fontbernat. The Poblenou Cemetery, also known as Cementiri de l’Est (East Cemetery), was the first to be built outside the walls that marked the perimeter of medieval Barcelona. A cemetery was first built at this location in 1775, but the original cemetery was destroyed by Napoleon’s troops in 1813. Soon after, the Italian architect Antonio Ginesi was commissioned to create a new design, which was consecrated in 1819. The cemetery has three sections: terraced burial niches at the front, individual monuments and mausoleums at the rear, and a narrow section along the south wall with more niches and common graves. Though many come to Poblenou Cemetery to see Petó de la Mort and other lavish monuments, one of the cemetery’s most popular residents can be found among the modest niches. Francesc Canals i Ambrós died in 1899 at the age of 22. During his short life, many believed that he had the ability to see the future—he even predicted his own early death. Some said that if you visited his grave and made a wish for love or health, it would come true. Francesc became known as the Saint of Poblenou. More than a century later, the supernatural story persists. Francesc’s grave and the niches that surround are often filled with flowers, candles, votive offerings, and more.",miracles memento mori death graves burial places cemeteries sculptures
229,Rossend Arús Masonic Library,"Barcelona, Spain",A once-secret library of Freemason history in Catalonia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rossend-arus-masonic-library,"During the 19th century, the fraternal order of Freemasons had lodges in practically every European-influenced country. Spain was no different, though the traces of the Freemasons are mostly hidden now—apart from this once-secret library. Barcelona, much like London, Paris, Buenos Aires, or Washington D.C., has an extraordinary artistic and architectural heritage based in Freemasonry. Masonic symbols like pyramids and the all-seeing eye can be found in cemeteries, libraries, sculptures, even government buildings. Passeig Sant Joan (“Saint John Avenue”) is devoted to Saint John, the chosen patron of Christian Freemasons. Ildefons Cerda, the urban planner who designed Barcelona’s layout, was a member, and imagined a utopian city based on Masonic principles. At the turn of the century, there were nearly 170 Freemason lodges in Spain alone. Rossend Arús was an influential journalist and playwright of the 1800s who used his Freemason associations for republican political favor. Along with his fellow Masons, Arús had control of the city from behind the scenes. He began to host meetings in his home in 1888, and it soon became an official Masonic Temple. After his death in 1891, the house was turned into a library dedicated to Freemasonry. During Franco’s regime, almost every Freemason building was torn down and the Masons were prohibited from meeting. Like many fascist leaders, Franco feared uprising from independent organizations, as well as having misplaced antisemitic beliefs about the Freemasons’ purposes. Some in power sympathized with the Freemasons though, and the Rossend Arús library was shut down and hidden from view during the Franco years. After the dictator’s death and the end of his regime, Freemasonry slowly but surely crept its way back into Spain. After timidly growing less and less private and secretive, the Freemasons of Barcelona have opened Biblioteca Publica Rossend Arús to the public in Passeig Sant Joan. The luxurious reading rooms, golden frames, and precious marble of the 19th century still impress visitors. The collection includes important Masonic texts, as well as anarchist collections and rare magazines and literature. The third original version of the Statue of Liberty also resides in the main entrance. Today, the Rossend Arús is the best library for studying the working class history and Freemasonry in Catalonia. Open to the public during the afternoon (3-7 pm).",freemasons libraries

Hiking wilderness trails. Sleeping in a pile of leaves. Shacking up in an underwater hotel with a view of the ocean floor. But seldom do these notions intersect with extreme sports. Margalef is the exception. Nestled in a remote and fantastically climbable conglomerate rock formation, Margalef is a tiny town of quaint houses and understated accommodations. The town is literally tucked in the crevices of the mountainous rocks that surround it, sometimes with only a few feet of space between someone’s front door and the solid rock across from it. This all adds up to be a rock climber’s dream destination, combining the enriching atmosphere of a rustic village with a truly unique and remote climbing destination. At times, the rocks one is climbing over and on top of are actually people’s homes, carved directly into the stone. Margalef is ideal for both types of ecotourists, of course, not just the extreme sports fans. People looking to get back to nature and experience a lifestyle that’s literally a part of nature will find Margalef just as charming as climbers find it intriguing and challenging.",cultures and civilizations places to stay eccentric homes shops homes architectural oddities architecture

Stretching narrowly on the outskirts of Tarragona, the Pont del Diable, also known as the Pont de les Ferreres, is a lasting mark from this innovative empire that nearly conquered the world. Built in the 1st century BCE, the Pont del Diable was constructed as a massive aqueduct that brought water to the city of Tarragona from 15 miles away. Sturdily constructed with two layers of arches, 711 feet still remain to forge a link to antiquity in Catalonia. Besides a link to the Roman Empire, the aqueduct was actually used into the 18th century to bring water to Tarragona, showing the perfection of Roman architecture. Nearly above the tree-line, the aqueduct rises 90 feet over the ground, and dark green trees around its sides nestle the monument deep in the Spanish countryside. Those who want to experience the aqueduct first hand and get an amazing view can take a tour on the bridge-like structure and walk along its perilous ledge.

Building a restaurant on top of a massive heat source is not the easiest task. Architects Eduardo Caceres and Jesus Soto had to lay 9 layers of basalt rock in lieu of digging down to build a foundation. A giant grill is laid across the opening, where 6 feet below, the gentle giant is softly bubbling lava at 400 degrees Celsius, apparently the perfect temperature for volcanically grilled meats. If the thought of trying to eat your salad as fire shoots in the air and lava spews out of the dining room deters you, fear not. This dormant volcano has been peacefully gurgling below the surface since it’s last eruption in 1824. What could possibly go wrong? Aside from the dramatic cooking methods, El Diablo also brags an amazing otherworldly panoramic view of Lanzarote’s Timanfaya National Park, a martian landscape of red sands and volcanic rock.

Its story begins as far back as 1293, when the Archbishop of Toledo was granted a charter by King Sancho IV of Castile to found a “studium generale.” Two hundred years later, in 1499, Pope Alexander VI granted a papal bull, which expanded the Complutense into a full university. Today, the best reason to visit the University is its Museum of Anatomy, “Javier Puerta,” created in 1787 by royal decree of King Charles III, who was known for his contributions to science and research. Part of the college of medicine, the museum is made up of anatomical models, mummified and artificial body parts, and three sculpture collections. The wax polychrome sculpture collection displays a series of anatomically precise wax models, representing the stages of pregnancy from conception to childbirth, the oldest of which date back to 1794. The plaster polychrome sculpture collection is essentially a collection of plaster sculptures of human body parts. The ominous-sounding bone collection is comprised of thousands of skulls, and two skeletons. One of these, which dates back to the Spanish War of Independence (1807-1814), is the skeleton of a French farmer and grenadier who, due to the mercury salts in his bones, is speculated to have been killed by mercury poisoning. The other is the the skeleton of the so-called Extremeño Giant, said to have been brought to the museum alive by Pedro Gonzalez de Velasco, the museum’s director at the time.

236,Central Market of Valencia,"Valencia, Spain",This amazing example of Valencian Art Nouveau looks more like a cathedral than a public market.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-market-of-valencia,"The site of the Central Market of Valencia (Mercat Central) was used as an open-air market starting in 1839, but by the end of the 19th century, city authorities were looking to build an indoor market space at the spot. What they got was a magnificent tribute to the architectural use of steel and glass. After a number of architectural competitions, the winning design was a stunning example of the modernist style known as Valencian Art Nouveau. From a distance, the structure looks more like a cathedral than a covered market: The roof’s domes, in particular the one with the large cupola at the center of the building, give the exterior an appearance very much like an Italian duomo. The domes and unique slopes of the roof admit pools of light inside that complement the ornate and varied interior decoration, adorned with iron columns, colorful ceramic tile, and stained glass. Completed in 1928 after 14 years of construction, the market covers over 86,000 square feet in two floors. Inside it mainly sells food, which is highly diverse and produces a fantastic smell. There are also a number of stalls selling touristic wares plus restaurants and bars, including the “central” bar, which is very popular with tourists and locals alike.

Castillo Torre Salvana dates back to the 10th century. It can be found just outside of the city of Barcelona and is little-known by most people, even many locals who live in the city. The fortress-like castle is located next to the historic Colonia Güell, a purpose-built village for the workers of a nearby textile mill. The castle was partially destroyed in the Catalan Civil War in 1224. It has sat abandoned for centuries. These days the ruins serve as a place where you can explore and capture some great photos. Many of the walls inside the castle have been eroded over time, but there are still distinct hallways and rooms to discover. The second floor is intact and offers a great view over the surrounding former factory village of Colonia Güell. The village’s church was designed by the famous architect Antoni Gaudi and, like Castillo Torre Salvana, is not very well known. The church can be seen from the castle’s second-floor windows, so you can experience two of Barcelona’s hidden gems at the same time. The easiest way to visit Castillo Torre Salvana is by car since it is outside of the city. Once you arrive in the village of Colonia Guell, park the car in front of the Church (it's the first car parking area you see as you enter the village).If you are looking in the direction of the Church, Castillo Torre Salvana will be directly behind you.

Travelling by subway in Stockholm is like being in a personal, mobile art  gallery that allows everyone in transit to experience the beauty of incredible mosaics, paintings, installations, and sculptures. It evokes feelings of being part of a modern-day archeological expedition, full of undiscovered secrets and surprises. The best part? Admission to this gallery costs nothing except for the train ticket, which has been extremely well-received by citizens of Sweden, as well as foreign visitors. In the early 1980’s, an outbreak of graffiti and vandalism threatened the beauty and the safety of the unique artwork in a number of stations, but eventually the vandals took their art elsewhere, allowing the gallery to exist unfettered. During that time however, the government spent an exorbitant amount of money in order to protect the subway from desecration.",collections architectural oddities architecture
239,Codex Gigas (The Devil's Bible),"Stockholm, Sweden","An illuminated manuscript comprising the life's work of a lone monk, inexplicably decorated with a portrait of Satan himself.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/codex-gigas-the-devil-s-bible,"The largest Medieval manuscript in the world is believed to have been the work of a single monk in Bohemia (in modern Czechia). Nevertheless, it’s not its 620 pages at three-feet in size that makes it remarkable; it’s the Devil contained therein. Literally meaning “giant book,” the Codex Gigas was created in the 13th century and originally stored in the Benedictine monastery at Podlažice. The manuscript contains not only the New and Old Testaments but also an assortment of other shorter texts addressing matters of extreme practicality for the time: exorcism, grammar, a calendar, and medical works, to name a few. Everything within the book was handwritten by a single, anonymous monk. The National Library of Sweden puts this massive undertaking into perspective: “If the scribe worked for six hours a day and wrote six days a week this means that the manuscript could have taken about five years to complete. If the scribe was a monk he may only have been able to work for about three hours a day, and this means that the manuscript could have taken ten years to write. As the scribe may also have ruled the lines to guide the writing before he began to write (it probably took several hours to rule one leaf), this extends the period it took to complete the manuscript. The scribe also decorated the manuscript, so this all means that the manuscript probably took at least 20 years to finish, and could even have taken 30.” These elements alone are enough to qualify the stunning manuscript as a wonder of the world. Yet the most bewitching element of the Codex Gigas is a single page of illumination that defies explanation, tucked away within the tome. Spanning nearly the entire face of a page is a full-color rendering of the Dark Lord himself. Speculation, plausible and otherwise, abounds as to how the unholiest feature possible made its way into this most sacred text, but answers remain elusive. Precisely because of this tension, everyone loves the Codex Gigas – or, the Devil’s Bible, if you prefer. The manuscript originally travelled to Stockholm in the late 16th century, plundered from the Holy Roman Emperor’s castle by the Swedish army during the Thirty Years War. This massive tome currently resides behind glass in a room on the second floor of the King’s Library (also called the National Library of Sweden) in Humlegården (“Humle” meaning “hops,” suggesting royalty grew hops there for their own beer, “gården” meaning “courtyard”), a lovely park in the posh Stockholm neighborhood of Östermalm.  The manuscript is not kept open and it is kept in a fairly dark room because of possible damage from light. There is a movie describing the history of the Codex in Swedish with English subtitles playing on a loop. For even more on the Codex Gigas, continue reading its feature as Atlas Obscura’s Object of Intrigue here. Update as of August 2022: The book is still on display but the inside is not for preservation reasons.

Among them was the building of Sweden’s first nuclear reactor, Reaktor 1, or R1, buried 25 meters directly underneath the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and within a 1 km of about 40,000 people. Nonetheless, in the heady days of the Cold War and nuclear armament it was deemed a tolerable risk for the scientists at KTH to be able to study reactions. Attempting to “make something with neutrons,” scientists brought the reactor online and on July 13, 1954, the reactor produced Sweden’s first nuclear reaction. R1 continued to be used for most of Sweden’s nuclear research until the 1970s, when the concern over the reactor proximity to Stockholm led to its closure. The reactor hall has since been opened to visitors and as of April 2007 the reactor hall can be visited from the KTH Museum of Science and Technology. The reactor is now a popular venue for modern art and dance performances. Update April 2017: The reactor is generally only open to visitors a couple of times per year, in conjunction with events, and is currently not open to the public at all while working with infrastructure. Update October 2018: The reactor is open once more! It can be visited during special events like the Stockholm Open House.",reactors retro-tech nuclear inventions

242,Vasa Museum,"Stockholm, Sweden",It houses the remains of a 17th-century version of the Titanic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vasa-museum,"Seventeenth-century Sweden was an up-and-coming state with great ambitions. Colonial expansion was on the mind of every royal, and for Sweden, the Navy was to be the backbone of any successful grand strategy. A ship called Vasa was built as the flagship of the new Swedish navy. King Gustavus Adolphus himself commissioned the ship. The ship was to be a giant floating fortress. The combined weight of the ammunition fired from one side of the boat was 588 pounds, making it the most well-armed ship to date. The Vasa’s armament included 48 light cannons, two additional large cannons of an older design, eight “three-pounders,” and six large howitzers for use during boarding action. All this heavy firepower was crammed onto both the ship’s lower and upper floors, making for a somewhat top-heavy design. Construction problems were evident from the beginning, and early stability tests showed the ship was in constant danger of capsizing. Nonetheless, under pressure from the royal court, the ship was completed on a very tight schedule. On August 10, 1628, the Vasa was deemed complete and launched on its maiden voyage. It managed to sail for a little less than one nautical mile. A gust of wind made it keel to its port side and water started pouring through the open gun ports onto its lower deck. The ship sank in matter of minutes, in full view of a crowd that had gathered to witness the launching, including foreign ambassadors and royal officials. The loss of the Vasa was a blow to both the prestige of Sweden and its economy—one from which its navy never fully recovered. Though the Swedish court looked long and hard for a guilty party, none were found, and the official investigator, upon being asked the cause of the sinking, replied “only God knows.” As the ship sank in only 32 meters of water, several early salvage attempts were made, all of them unsuccessful. The ship’s location was eventually lost to history, until it was relocated in the 1950s under the efforts of amateur archaeologist Anders Franzén. Vasa was lifted to the surface in April of 1961 after being underwater for some 333 years. Thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around the hull of the the Vasa. (Ironically it was the heavy pollution of the Swedish bay that killed wood-eating microorganisms and helped preserve the ship.) The Vasa Museum was opened in 1990 to permanently house the remains of the ship.

Storkyrkobadet is located in a vault, in the basement of a building dating back to the 17th century in Stockholm’s Old Town. The building was originally a Dominican convent during which time the vault served alternately as a coal and wine cellar. In the 1890s, the building was converted to a primary school, and the vault became the baths for the students. It would take another half century before a sauna was built and the bath was opened to the public. The bath is still old fashioned in many ways, with its architecture and interior unchanged since it was first built. It consists of just one shallow pool and a number of tiny tubs where visitors can sit and relax. Throughout the years, Storkyrkobadet has become a popular meeting point for the gay community, probably because of the separate opening hours for men and women. Sweden’s most famous gay couple, Jonas Gardell and Mark Levengood, met here in the 1980s. Despite its popularity and history, Storkyrkobadet’s existence is in danger. The city planned to close it in the ’80s but thanks to a volunteer organization called Föreningen De Glada Badarnait (“Society of Merry Bathers”) it was able to live on—at least for another few decades.

The 360-degree tower of books at the top is a bibliophile’s temple to reading in-the-round. The graceful rotunda is open to the public, who can climb to the top of the stacks and peer down on the collections below. The library is an example of Nordic Classicism, pioneered by Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund in the 1920s. The slightly chilly façade is, at the same time, oddly inviting, as if to say “we are here to work, but all are welcome.” This style was sometimes known as “Swedish Grace,” a simplified and accessible classicism that had great influence on everything from furniture design to sculpture. Beyond its unique architectural design, the Stadsbiblioteket contains over 2 million volumes and more than 2.4 million audio tapes, and was one of the first libraries to allow direct access to the stacks without the help of a retrieving librarian.  It also hosts the International Library, housed in two stories of an annex behind the main building.

245,Victoriahuset (Victoria House),"Stockholm, Sweden",A rare surviving Victorian greenhouse designed specifically to house giant water lilies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/victoriahuset,"Hidden near the royal Brunnsviken Lake is the Bergian Garden, an 18th-century academic botanical garden. The garden’s most intriguing structure is its unique 20th-century aquatic greenhouse, which was built specifically to house tropical lilies. This greenhouse is not only unusual in Sweden, but also in most of Europe, as very few original Victoria greenhouses have survived since the time of their popularity. The greenhouse was a brainchild of Bergianus Veit Wittrock, who had great scientific interest in aquatic plants and algae. After much lobbying, he managed to get approval from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1899, and the greenhouse was quickly erected. The literal and figurative centerpiece of this greenhouse is the Victoria Lily, the largest waterlily species in the world. Wittrock also planted many other species of lilies and aquatic plants inside, which then were bred and studied in this simulated Amazonian environment. This was not an easy task in the early 1900s, especially in the Swedish winter, when the greenhouse had to be kept warm with coal fires. The structure itself is built from cast-iron and dome-shaped glass, an incredibly heavy construction that is disproportionately vulnerable to the humid climate inside the greenhouse. It was restored in the 1980s and the early 2000s. It’s currently being recognized as a national monument of high protection value.  The greenhouse is open from May 1 to September 30 on weekdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and weekends 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. It's closed on weekends for Midsummer Eve, Midsummer Day, and Sunday after Midsummer Eve.",greenhouses botanical gardens victorian plants
246,Colour by Numbers,"Stockholm, Sweden",This Stockholm light tower can be controlled by anyone with a smartphone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/colour-by-numbers,"In cities across the globe, color-changing lights on buildings and towers are used to celebrate everything from the Fourth of July to St. Patrick’s Day, but the permanent light installation Colour by Numbers in Stockholm’s Telefonplan tower may be the only one in the world that can be controlled by anyone with a phone. Installed in 2006, the rainbow-colored installation uses the windows in the upper portion of the 20-story spire to project whatever hue is ordered up by people via a smartphone app. Either standing on site or even through a streaming webcam, amateur painters of light who want to make their temporary mark on the Stockholm skyline can choose which floor they would like to color and then create a custom color using a mixable RGB interface. Even without a smartphone, people can call a free number and paint the tower using just their keypad. The tower’s lights can be seen from all around southern Stockholm and the creators hope that the work can stand as a statement on the power of democracy and the power of the public. On some level this installation is successful in this endeavor, but it is also simply a cool bit of city-hacking that can make citizens and visitors alike connect with an often alienating urban environment. Colour by Numbers is right next to the metro station Telefonplan on one of the red lines south of Stockholm central station.",public towers art

Offering eco-friendly quarters 15 feet off the ground, each room offers stunning views of the forest and rolling hills. Since a different architect created each of the five rooms, their styles differ wildly. There is a bird’s nest, an elevated cabin, a red shack called the Blue Cone, a flying saucer, and the Mirrorcube. Mirrorcube has come to be the most well known room, covered on all six sides with mirrors that reflect the forest. As a symbol of the guiding environmental principles, visitors staying in Mirrorcube melt into the landscape while enjoying the ultra-modern and minimalist interior. Besides the five rooms, the Treehotel also features a sauna, and has plans to expand to a total of 24 rooms.",polar week treehouses places to stay hotels shops architectural oddities architecture
248,Kungsträdgården Metro Station,"Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm's deepest subway station is also a stunning ecological wonder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kungstradgarden-metro-station,"Beneath Stockholm runs one of the world’s most beautiful subway systems. Since the 1950s, the majority of the stations have been decorated with paintings, art installations, sculptures and mosaics created by more than 150 artists. The Kungsträdgården station is not only one of the most impressive artistically, it is also the deepest and, as researchers have recently discovered, home to its own self-sufficient ecosystem. The Kungsträdgården metro station was opened in 1977 after considerable controversy. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, large swaths of central Stockholm were being demolished and replaced with modern buildings. Stockholmers were seriously fed up with all this construction, and when plans to build the new Kungsträdgården subway station were announced, things got heated. The planned entrance to the new station was to be located in a park and would require cutting down a number of old elm trees. Protests ensued, people chained themselves to the trees, and the demonstrators clashed with police. The residents won, however, and the planned entrance was moved to a less objectionable location. Since then, all kinds of good things have been happening 112 feet below ground in Kungsträdgården station. Visually, it is one of the most striking stations below Stockholm. Sections of exposed rock reach up to arched ceilings decorated with colorful mosaics. Original artworks hang from or are painted directly onto the walls. Relics from some of the old houses torn down during the redevelopment of central Stockholm also appear in the station: old statues, intricately carved columns, old water fountains, and more. Further reflecting the above-ground history of the area are replicas of the statues that once existed on the grounds of Makalös Palace, a magnificent mansion and gardens that once occupied the area now above the station, but was destroyed by a fire in 1825. Kungsträdgården has also become famous for an altogether less obvious feature. Since its construction, the station has developed its own self-sufficient ecosystem, with organisms more commonly found in caves and grottos than in subway systems. In 2012, while the station was closed for rail work, a team of researchers went to take samples from the naked granite walls. They soon found a whole array of life, from crane flies to rare moss and tiny insects and worm-like animals. Most surprisingly, they also discovered a rare cave dwarf spider, Lessertia dentichelis, which shouldn’t even exist in northern Europe. It’s believed the 3-millimeter arachnid hitched a ride on construction equipment brought from central Europe during the construction of the subway. Later, in 2016, scientists also discovered a previously unknown fungus on the station walls. The ecosystem is fed by the station’s artificial lighting, as well as the chalk that drips down from the humanmade ceiling. Even the passengers who walk through the station each day provide a constant source of energy-rich molecules, such as hair and other human detritus.  Kungsträdgården station is located in the Norrmalm district. It is the end station of lines 10 and 11 of the Stockholm metro.",ecology underground trains transportation subterranean sites design art

250,Birthplace of the Stockholm Syndrome,"Stockholm, Sweden","Now a hotel, this former bank was the site of a robbery that spawned a psychological phenomenon.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/birthplace-of-the-stockholm-syndrome,"The robbery at Norrmalmstorg in 1973 took an unexpected turn when the hostages started sympathizing with their captors. In an instant the Stockholm Syndrome was born. The corner at the intersection between Norrmalmstorgsgatan and Hamngatan in Stockholm was once the location for one of Kreditbanken’s (The Credit Bank) offices. On an August day in 1973, Jan-Erik “Janne” Olsson, on leave from prison, went into the bank armed with a submachine gun and tried to rob it. The police were on the scene right away and two officers went inside. Olsson opened fire, injuring one of them in the hand and the jaw. He then ordered the other policeman to sit in a chair and “sing something.” He chose Lonesome Cowboy by Elvis Presley. Olsson took four persons in the staff hostage and barricaded himself in the vault. He demanded that his friend Clark Olofsson, at the time imprisoned, be brought there and his demand was met. A few days into the  robbery attempt, the police drilled holes through the wall to the vault to take pictures. Olofsson fired his gun at the forensic officers photographing the scene and wounded one of them in the face and the hand. He threatened to kill the hostages if any attempts to release gas into the vault were made, and he now and then forced the hostages to stand up with slip knots around their necks so that they would be strangled, as insurance against these attempts. In the end, Olsson and Olofsson surrendered after half an hour and none of the hostages sustained any permanent injuries. During and after the attempted robbery, the hostages showed sympathy for the robbers and criticized the police for their actions. The Swedish Prime Minister talked with the offenders and the hostages during the drama and one of the latter defended their captors, saying that the police had opened fire first. Some of them also insisted that the robbers should get safe passage to the car that they had demanded. This behavior, unheard of at the time, stirred interest in the academic world. It was the criminologist and psychiatrist Nils Bejerot who was working for the police at the time that coined the expression “Norrmalmstorgssyndromet” (The Norrmalmstorg Syndrome). This later became known as Stockholm Syndrome.",psychiatry banks crime crime and punishment

Though its origin is unknown, it’s estimated to date back nearly a millennia, to the 11th century. Officially called “Uppland Runic Inscription 53,” the Gamla stan stone is prominently located at the intersection of Prästgatan and Kåkbrinken streets, but can be hard to spot without a guide as there are no signs or plaques pointing out its significance. It’s about waist height behind the street corner post. The stone depicts a serpent body in decorative winding loops, and an inscription that has been partially translated as “Torsten and Frögunn had the stone erected after their son.” The name of the son is sadly lost. The female name, Frögunn, is a known pagan name, which lent a clue as to the origin of the text. It’s believed the stone was brought into Gamla stan from a neighboring area to be used as construction material. Inscription 53 is one of three runestones found in Stockholm’s old town. Another, known as “U 274” was originally found in a wall and is now displayed in the Museum of Medieval Stockholm.

The 5,500 square meter Icehotel is rebuilt each year with snow, ice, and “snice,” a mixture of snow and ice that helps hold the whole place together like mortar. All of the frozen materials for the structures are taken from the waters of the nearby Torne River around December, and then the buildings return to the waterway when the site melts around April. The exact number of rooms varies from year to year but generally hovers around 65, with each chamber being a unique space designed by a visiting artist. Artists from all over the word vie annually for the opportunity to be among the year’s list of artisans invited to put their unique vision and skills to work in designing and decorating one of the rooms. It is art at once beautiful, practical, and as fleeting as a flake of snow. The destination is also popular among newlyweds who can tie the knot in the adjacent Ice Chapel, and then stay afterward to take advantage of the beauty of the hotel’s bridal suite. In addition to the artist designed rooms, the common spaces feature ice chandeliers, and crystal clear furnishings, with running fountains, tinkling ornamentation, statuary both peaceful and fierce, all crafted entirely of ice and snow. The original Icehotel is, well, pretty cool.  The hotel exists between December and Mid April, and is accessible by car, taxi, or shuttle service from Kiruna airport.

That is, until 2014, when it was transformed into one of Europe’s largest graffiti exhibitions. Practically every sliver of the walls along the streets running through the neighborhood is covered by graffiti. Eye-catching images of people, animals, and objects adorn whatever space is available. The paintings are done by different street artists from around the world, transforming Snösätra into a canvas that displays a mishmash of different graffiti styles and themes. The owners of the buildings are perfectly willing to let the artists cover the walls with their work. Every spring, more than 150 graffiti artists from Sweden and beyond descend upon the neighborhood to create new pieces as part of an annual street art festival. The festival includes music, a graffiti battle, and even a virtual reality portion that lets revelers attempt to show off their street art skills within a virtual world. There’s also a wall that’s open to the public to paint, as long as people stick to the rules posted. Unfortunately, the future of Snösätra is uncertain, as there are plans to turn it into a residential area. As of yet, it’s still a refuge for graffiti lovers, far from the beaten path. Update as of July 2021: The southern part of Snösätra has been torn down and will be turned into a nature reserve. However, the northern part is still there, covered in graffiti for you to enjoy.

255,Ribbinska Huset,"Stockholm, Sweden",It is said that each of the white stones in the red facade of this medieval house represents the head of a murdered Swedish noble.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ribbinska-huset,"Stockholm’s old town, Gamla Stan, is a beautiful collection of historical buildings that really make you wish that walls could speak. Dating back to the 13th century, with many of its original buildings still intact, it is like a living museum on Sweden’s history. But the area also hides some darker stories from the country’s past, and this is one of them. On the Stortorget (literally meaning “Large Square”) there stands an unassuming dark red building, beautifully decorated with white bricks scattered throughout the facade. Called Ribbinska huset (“House of Ribbing”), it dates back to the 15th century. Most visitors would not look twice at this building, until they learn that each of the white stones in the red wall is said to represent the head of a murdered Swedish noble. Sweden has a long and turbulent history with Denmark that has led to many wars between the two countries. In 1520, Sweden was conquered by Christian II of Denmark, who would then be crowned the king of Sweden. Soon after this, Christian II felt he needed to deal with the Swedish nobles in order to secure his rule. He did this by inviting them to a banquet to talk peace in a building in Gamla Stan. He then commenced with beheading each and every one of them publicly. This act gave him the title of Kristian Tyrann, Christian the Tyrant. Unfortunately for the king, the slaughter had quite the opposite effect as desired. One nobleman was left alive, because he was not able to attend the “peace talks.” His name was Gustav Vasa, and he was the son of one of the murdered nobles. He managed to rally the people of Sweden during a two-year trek through the country, amassing a large army that he then used to win back the country and defeat Christian the Tyrant. This day is still remembered as the day of Swedish independence. Not much later, the buildings around the Gamla Stan town square were rebuilt, and one of them, house number 20, became a monument to the fallen. Ribbinska huset was first built around 1479, but the white stones on the facade were added in 1628. Some say they symbolize the decapitated heads of the 82 people who were killed that day by the Danish king, in the infamous event known as the Stockholm Bloodbath.  Ribbinska huset is also known as Schantzka huset (""House of Schantz”).",murder medieval houses homes history

The crooked lichen-covered pines were misshapen by decades of strong winds off the Baltic Sea. Ivy crawls up many of the trees, while giant old oaks are scattered throughout the woods. This enchanting and a bit eerie landscape is thanks to the forest’s unusual geography. It’s located on the very northeastern tip of the Swedish island of Öland, wedged between the Baltic Sea to the east and the protected Grankullaviken bay to the west. While the exposed trees near the shingle beach on the Baltic side have been weathered by the elements, the vegetation on the bay side of the forest looks completely different. Trollskogen is part of a nature reserve that protects the area’s unique ecology, including many rare insect species and fungi. Parts of the forest have been hollowed out by years of cattle grazing and logging by local farmers. Still about 30 elderly oaks are interspersed among the gnarled pines; the most famous of them is called Trolleken, or “Troll Oak,” and is one of the oldest trees on Sweden’s northeast coast. Were that not mystical enough, ancient burial cairns and stone circles can also be found in this strange wood, along with the remains of old fortifications from the 15th century, when the area served as a major naval base on the Baltic. The ruins of a shipwreck that ran aground near the Troll Forest in 1926 can also be seen along the shore.  Best visited with your own transport. The forest is located within the Trollskogen Nature Reserve area.

In 1865, Alfred Nobel bought a farm in Vinterviken in Stockholm to start manufacturing the highly explosive and violently unstable compound, nitroglycerine. The business started small but soon expanded to meet the demand for the chemical, created by the building of a few railroad tunnels in the city. The spot was chosen carefully, it was surrounded by hills to protect the neighboring areas from any accidental explosions, but was still close to Stockholm and next to the water providing the potential to build quays. Initially, the facilities were simple sheds and some of the manufacturing took place outdoors. The spring of 1866 marked a dark period for the facility with a few serious accidents killing numerous employees. By that time Nobel had already lost his brother in a similar accident a few years earlier and he realized that something had to be done to handle and transport the explosive in a safe way. Nitroglycerine was too volatile and could explode for seemingly no reason at all. Alfred started experimenting with different explosives and absorbents but couldn’t find what he was looking for until he one day happened to mix nitroglycerine with diatomaceous earth. The result was a soft, pliable material, like dough, relatively stable, and easy to handle safely. He succeeded in detonating the material using his blasting cap and kaboom, dynamite was born. Today only a few traces can be found of what was the world’s first commercial factory for nitroglycerine. The former explosives factory now houses a restaurant, but a few blasting bunkers can still be found next to the water.  Vinterviken is a 15-20 minute walk away from the metro station Aspudden on the red line.",nobel prize factories science

Constructed from all-natural material, each hut has a wood heater, and offers no electricity, nor running water. And it should be reiterated, it is a hut – made of little more than wood and tree branches, providing a completely unique experience both outside and in. Candles, matches, and firewood for self-cutting are included in the amenities. A nearby spring is used to fetch water, and several fire pits are available for outdoor cooking, that is, after the firewood has been chopped. An organic self-serve breakfast made from all local, all organic fare is offered during the fall, spring, and summer seasons. Other activities on the site include a floating sauna, biking, hiking, and wolf-howling. In 2004 Kolarbyn started a project to preserve Sweden’s 400-year-old tradition of charcoaling -a process of extracting iron by producing charcoal in kilns. Around the Kolarbyn sites are hundreds of remnants of charcoal kilns, and since 2004 many new kilns have been put to use.

Fans of Gabriel García Márquez can have the banquet from 1982 (with Arctic char in dill cream sauce and Nobel ice cream), while Marie Curie devotees can toast her 1911 chemistry prize by dining on fonds d´artichauts duchesse and poularde fermière (artichoke bottoms “duchess-style” and farm chicken). Unfortunately for those without Nobel prize money, Nobel banquets will set you back. The price of the 2017 banquet is currently 1865 SEK ($200) per person, but that will change after the 2018 Nobel banquet. Vintage menus (i.e., anything earlier than the previous year) have varying prices, require a party of 10 or more, and need to be booked at least a week in advance. If that sounds too lavish, you can always simply stop into the restaurant for lunch and gawk at the Stadshuskällaren’s vaulted ceilings and lush decor.  Contact Stadshuskällaren for the pricing on menus from past years. Also, don't go on December 10: The restaurant is closed for the Nobel banquet.",feast nobel prize decadent delights Unique Restaurants & Bars
261,Museum of Medieval Stockholm,"Stockholm, Sweden",The discovery of an old wall led to the creation of this fascinating museum about the city in the Middle Ages.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-medieval-stockholm,"Some say Stockholm was first settled by a fisherman who caught a big salmon and boasted that it would not end up on the bishop’s table. The bishop overheard him and wanted him arrested, so the fisherman did the only reasonable thing and fled to a nearby island, becoming Stockholm’s original inhabitant. This story and many more are covered in the Museum of Medieval Stockholm, a museum right next to the King’s Castle in the city center. It was built within an excavated space that was discovered by workers digging into the earth while building a new parking lot. Now transformed into a museum, the old archaeological site is full of artifacts that speak to the city’s medieval past. Enter the museum, and you’ll receive a crash-course on life in medieval Stockholm as well as the area’s general history, which includes information about Sweden’s past royals and all the drama that surrounded their lives. Look around, and you’ll find old buildings, a piece of the wall that once defended the city from raiders, and an old Viking ship on display. There’s also a runestone, which is similar to the one in Gamla.  The museum is free to enter. Because of its underground nature, it remains cool, so it's a great place to visit during a hot day.",vikings medieval archaeology museums and collections museums

Perhaps that’s why moose milk cheese can set a buyer back as much as $500 per pound, making it one of the most expensive cheeses in the world. But for those with a druthers for dairy, The Elk House (Europeans call their moose “elk”) in Bjurholm, Sweden, makes four varieties of the pricey product, all thanks to three moose sisters. Gullan, Haelga, and Juno lactate only from May through the end of September. Coaxing the five liters of milk from each moose per day takes a delicate hand and calm demeanor, which leads to the product’s prestige and price. The Johanssons, who own the Elk House farm, make four kinds of cheese from the high-protein milk: a soft, white-mold variety similar to Camembert; a creamy blue cheese; a dried blue cheese; and feta. The latter, which gets preserved in a neutral vegetable oil, is the Elk House’s bestseller. Some reviewers say the feta has a mildly acidic flavor and smooth texture. While some of the varieties are available at select restaurants scattered across the country, that’s as far as they travel. All the more reason to visit the Elk House’s farm and pay respects to these fine lactating ladies.  The farm offers tours and has a restaurant with plenty of delicious options, including a raspberry and cream parfait made with moose feta cheese.",expensive eats rare foods dairy milk cheese meat farms
263,Mårten Trotzigs Gränd,"Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm's narrowest alley is barely over two feet wide.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marten-trotzigs-grand,"Stockholm’s old town, Gamla Stan, is a beautiful maze of centuries-old buildings that tower above the twisting little streets. It was never designed with cars in mind, and this is very clear from the width of the streets. Some of the old streets of Gamla Stan are so narrow that two people cannot walk shoulder to shoulder without getting intimate. And the most narrow of all is Mårten Trotzigs Gränd. This street, located in the middle of the old town, connects the two main roads with a very skinny staircase and a few lamps that hang from the wall. At its narrowest, it is just 35 inches wide, barely enough for the lamp to not touch the opposite wall. The street is named after the rich German merchant Mårten Trotzig. Trotzig moved to Stockholm in the 16th century and made his fortune selling iron and copper, becoming one of the richest men in the city. He bought up the area around the little alleyway and opened a shop there. The alley did not have a name back then and quickly became named after him.  The alley is located between Västerlånggatan and Prästgatan and is free to access.",street names alleyways history

This statue, called “Rag and Bone,” is somehow even sadder for having a fox face. Since 2008 the helpless little fox has been waiting on the street, asking passersby to give spare a thought for the homeless, and maybe some change as well. The artwork was created by British sculptor Laura Ford, and later purchased by the city of Stockholm. At first glance, the squat beastly hobo looks like an almost realistic pile of old blankets, but further inspection reveals the sad little fox face. The figure has nothing in the world but a single boot and its pile of ratty blankets. The statue was placed near the corner of Drottninggatan and Strömgatan, in the heart of the city where the tourists and the most wealthy can see it. Its placement was the result of a public vote that wanted the little symbol of poverty to stand out to those who are in the most need of being reminded. Well liked by both Swedes and tourists, the rag and bone fox is often surrounded by pocket change that is left at its feet. It may not be the happiest statue in the world, but even though it might make you give some time to an uncomfortable subject, it remains undeniably a little cute. Update January 2022: The statue is now located at the first floor of kulturhuset, probably until construction at Drottninggatan are complete.  The statue is freely accessible during opening hours and can be seen through the window.",monuments statues animals
265,Disgusting Food Museum,"Malmö, Sweden",This collection of 80 polarizing foods aims to challenge your subjective notions of repulsion.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/disgusting-food-museum,"The Disgusting Food Museum invites guests to expand their understanding of global food culture and challenge their prejudices by interacting with 80 different foods from around the world. From maggot-infused cheese from Italy to Iceland’s ammonia-scented shark to the United States’ meat-and-gelatin Jell-O salads, there’s something likely to incite initial feelings of discomfort in every visitor, either via taste, texture, aroma, or preparation. Even pork made the list, not due to its sensory attributes, but for the horrific nature of factory farming that accounts for most of the world’s pig supply. Each item is presented with a short profile, explaining how it’s prepared and enjoyed in its place of origin. By including foods from around the world, the museum highlights the subjectivity of disgust. Root beer, a favorite in Canada and the United States, is featured because many Europeans think it tastes like toothpaste. Meanwhile, surströmming, a fermented Baltic herring that’s a favorite sandwich topper in Sweden, made the cut for its aroma, which some compare to rotten eggs. There are plenty of opportunities for visitors to smell and taste select items so they can confront their preconceived notions with firsthand experience. It may be called the Disgusting Food Museum, but the project aims to break down visitors’ notions of disgust through playful exposure and exploration of the unknown. As the museum puts it, “Sharing a meal is the best way to turn strangers into friends.” The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Disgusting Food Museum.  The museum is located at Södra Förstadsgatan 2, a 10-minute walk from the Malmö Triangeln station.

266,Solar Egg,"Stockholm, Sweden",A golden egg-shaped sauna in the Arctic tundra.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/solar-egg,"The northern part of Swedish Lapland is a frigid region with no lack of saunas, but none so unique as a hot room housed within a giant, shiny golden egg surrounded by the icy landscape of the Arctic. Originally erected in Kiruna, one of the northernmost towns in Sweden, the Solar Egg stands 15 feet tall. In the middle of a field of snow, it reflects the white expanse on 69 golden panes of glass. The egg’s interior is a piping hot sauna where visitors can bask in the heat, relax, and talk. You enter the surreal structure through a golden staircase, which leads to a small circular sauna that seats eight people. It’s heated by a wood-burning, human heart-shaped stove in the center, which reaches temperatures of 167 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit. The Solar Egg was created by Swedish artist duo Bigert & Bergström and was donated to the mining town of Kiruna by the Swedish government as a repayment for the massive sinkholes that endangered the city in 2004. Due to the over-extraction of iron ore by local mining companies, the city began to sink, forcing Kiruna to move to an entirely new location at a cost of over $1 billion. In response, the Swedish government repaid Kiruna’s residents with the unusual egg sauna, which is free of charge for locals. The ovate sauna was such a hit that eventually it went on tour, with stops in Gällivare, Copenhagen, Charlottenborg, Paris, and more. In February 2019, the Solar Egg returned to its original home in Kiruna for a period, before moving to a new permanent home at Artipelag, an art museum in Stockholm, in 2022.  The Solar Egg is set to move to various locations, mostly around Kiruna but also to other places.

If you peek above the door of Skeppsbron 44 in the Old Town of Stockholm, you’ll see a stone face sporting an exaggerated expression - a potent mix of despair, disgust, and rage. And below the grimace, if you look carefully, you’ll spot…something else. Is that..? Oh yes. Yes it is. While no one really knows where the stone vagina came from, according to legend, it is the work of an aggrieved 20th century man named Carl Smitt. Carl owned the building and found out that his wife had been cheating on him. In revenge, he had her genitalia sculpted and mounted on the wall, so that all the world could see her betrayal. Above her lady bits, he installed his own tormented face. But Carl wasn’t done. Not only did he have an axe to grind and a sculptor on the payroll, he also had some, erm, dynamic artistic vision. Wanting to take his gross public retribution to the next level, he requested that the sculpture be built so that on rainy days, the water would fall from his face like tears, showering the labia he loved and lost. Don’t you wish he’d just written some bad poetry and called it a day? The carving is just a short walk from the Slussen metro station, on the red and green lines. From the metro stop, it's just a few minutes' walk to the north along the east shore of Gamla Stan (Stockholm's Old Town).",sex sculptures

You will know when you are in the nation Ladonia, because it is marked by two monumental creative works: Nimis and Arx. Created by artist Lars Vilks, Nimis (Latin for “too much”) is a maze-like wooden artwork made of 70 tons of driftwood and nails and culminating in a teetering, nine-story wooden tower. Arx (Latin for “fortress”) is a stone and concrete sculpture resembling a melting sand castle. Nimis, the first of the two sculptures was begun in 1980 and went unnoticed by authorities for 2 years until 1982, when they declared it would have to be destroyed. As a means of outmaneuvering the Swedish authorities, even while Nimis was scheduled for destruction, Lars sold it to the artist Cristo. The legal document of the sale is a piece of driftwood, once a piece of the artwork itself, on display at the Swedish Museum of Sketches. Another means of avoiding government interference (or perhaps tauntingly inviting it) was for Vilks to declare the area an independent nation. The nation of Ladonia, occupying essentially only the area around the sculptures, was declared in 1996 and has already had its share of national incidents. War was declared on Ladonia by the satirical “Armed Coalition Forces of the Internets.” Ladonia also claims a “population” of over 15,000, though no one resides on the site as “all of its citizens are nomads.” Unfortunately, this was not entirely clear in the online application form, and some 3000 Pakistanis, confused by the micro-nation’s website, applied for immigrant status. They were granted it, as anyone who applies is given citizenship. However, as the Pakistanis began asking about Ladonia’s embassy and the details of how to get there, it became clear that actually moving to Ladonia was not a possibility.  Closest larger city is Höganäs, closest smaller town is Arild. From Arild, you can walk or drive to the Himmelstorp farmstead. From here, looking at the view, you turn right, and follow the painted yellow N's. The actual art work is about 1-2km away from here. Coordinates: 56°17?16? N, 12°32?22?

King Valdemar had commanded his forces to conquer parts of southern Sweden, landing there with an army of mounted knights and German foot mercenaries. The invaders faced off against the poorly equipped locals, whose ranks included children and the elderly. The ensuing battle was a devastating blow to the local farming community, with more than half of Gotland’s farmers slain in the fight. The dead fighters were buried in mass graves alongside their chainmail shirts and gloves and weapons. Excavations in the 20th-century revealed five mass graves outside the city of Visby’s walls. The skeletons, armor, and weapons were remarkably well-preserved. This allowed scientists to study the bones to determine the injuries the soldiers suffered, as well as glean information about their living conditions, diseases, heights, and ages. A permanent exhibit in the Swedish History Museum displays some of the soldiers’ skeletons. You’ll also find armor believed to belong to a noble family and a leather pouch that held a small fortune of coins that is believed to have belonged to one of King Valdemar’s soldiers.

No one is sure quite why the stone design was created but according to legend is is the resting place of a mythic king. The Ales Stenar (Ales Stones) were placed on their Swedish cliff just 1,400 years ago, although they stand over a burial site that has been dated to 5,500 years old. There are 59 tall boulders in the formation which is made in the shape of a longship, and was possibly symbolic of a craft that would ferry the dead to their eternal fate. Beneath the boat-stones researchers have discovered the remains of an even more ancient burial chamber, sans human remains, confirming their theories as to the funerary purpose behind the ship formation, yet just who was to be buried there remains a mystery. Legend has it that King Ale the Strong, a figure from Swedish myth, is buried under the henge, although there does not seem to be a great deal on the site to confirm this. More likely is that a lesser-known viking chieftain was buried, or meant to be buried in the spot and the stones were erected to honor his eternal memory. Whoever the Ales Stenar were originally meant to honor, they stand now as an impressive and beautiful site that make it easy to see why someone would want to be buried there.",standing stones vikings
271,Øresund Bridge,"Malmö, Sweden",This chimerical bridge/tunnel appears to dead end right into the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oresund-bridge,"Supporting both cars and trains as they pass between Denmark and the southern tip of Sweden, the Øresund Bridge (or Øresundsbron, as it is nicknamed in a mishmash of Swedish and Danish), transitions from bridge to tunnel as the road and railway dips beneath the waves. The passenger travel connection was completed in 1999, connecting the Swedish city of Malmö to the Danish metropolis of Copenhagen. While building a bridge over the Øresund Strait was not a huge challenge in itself, doing so without interfering with the air traffic above or the shipping traffic on the water seemed almost impossible. Building a suspension bridge tall enough to allow ships to pass beneath it would prevent the busy Copenhagen Airport nearby from functioning. A bridge built any lower would have halted ship traffic. The simple yet unusual solution was a bridge that would descend beneath the waves halfway across the strait. A man-made island known as Peberholm was built to support the transition point and a tunnel was dug beneath the strait on the Danish end (known independently as the Drogden Tunnel). On the Swedish side, the sweeping suspension bridge was constructed to slowly slope right into the water, making it look from the outside as if the bridge gives up and curves into nothingness. Today the bridge is the longest automobile and rail bridge in Europe, despite being half-tunnel (the people making such distinctions do not like to be discriminatory). With an estimated 17,000 cars passing over and under the Øresund Strait each day, this span brings a newly literal meaning to the phrase “bridge and tunnel.”",tunnels bridges subterranean sites architectural oddities architecture

The arcade is inside a pool hall, but once you are in you'll know it's the right place. The arcade works on a token basis, generally 10 SEK for 1 token, with some discounts if you buy many tokens.

While the damage has left the spruce looking particularly rough, Old Tjikko will survive: The majority of the tree, including the most ancient parts of its root system, is underground.) Growing high atop Sweden’s Fulufajallet Mountain is a Norway Spruce that sure doesn’t look like much—but this little tree is an estimated 9,550 years old, and goes by the name of Old Tjikko. Located in Fulufjallet National Park, Old Tjikko began growing in this harsh tundra shortly after the glaciers receded from Scandinavia at the close of the last ice age. To put that into perspective, this lowly shrub was growing as humans learned to plow fields, domesticate the cat, and—2,000 years after it first took root—our ancestors begin learning to smelt copper. Though the tree may have spent millennia as a shrub before the climate warmed enough for it to grow into the spindly tree we see today, scientists had a hunch Old Tjikko was part of an ancient clonal organism. When setting out to establish the tree’s exact age, they carbon-dated the roots system beneath the tree itself, revealing the true age of Old Tjikko. Researchers have also found in this area a cluster of about 20 spruce trees, all of them over 8,000 years old. To add even more to the charm of this scraggly nine thousand-year-old tree, Old Tjikko was named after discoverer Leif Kullman’s dog.  Though a small, unmarked path, leading through the park to the tree exists, rangers much prefer to lead interested visitors on a guided tour from the Naturum's entrance to the base of the tree for the sake of environmental preservation. The best option to visit the tree is to join a tour run by the National Park authorities, Wednesday through Friday from July to August.

Since that time, very little changed about the ride until the last few years. Suddenly brightly colored children’s toys began peppering the darkness. Appearing at equally spaced intervals, nearly thirty playthings (plus or minus a few) punctuate the two-and-a-half minute ride. No one knows exactly how the toys get there, but this mysterious task requires a key to the metro, so it seems like an inside job. Regardless of the individual responsible, for the past few years, the occasional teddy bear or unnamable plush animal has appeared to join other comrades in the tunnel, likely hailing from inside the funicular’s cars where they have been left behind, unclaimed, by a child. In May 2012, Stockholm’s city officials in charge of safety matters decided the toys should be removed from the tunnel and handed over to the transportation department’s lost and found office, suggesting these creatures’ components made them a “fire hazard.” What Stockholm’s officials hadn’t anticipated was the degree to which its citizens had grown attached to their fuzzy companions in the funicular. Thanks to immediate counter-demonstrations in favor of the toys’ presence, their cheery faces can still be seen decorating the Nybohov Funicular today.  The southbound red line from Stockholm central station will take you to Liljeholmen. Go up the escalator in the direction of travel, go through the gates, take a right turn and continue straight ahead. The tunnel leading to the entrance will be on your left.

In those heady days, beached whales were not generally rescued, but slaughtered, and such was the fate of this one. The fishermen who first discovered the poor stranded whale started the procedure by poking its eyes out, so that it would “not be able to see us.” Over the next two days, the creature was methodically axed, speared and shot until it finally died in a sea of its own blood. The next day, August Wilhelm Malm, taxidermist and curator of the Gothenburg Museum showed up to the scene and purchased the beast from its killers for his museum collection. Not content to hack the creature apart to transport just major pieces to the museum, Malm decided that he had to have the whale whole and intact. It took three steamboats and two coal barges to tow the whale to the Göteborg shore. Greeted by a crowded of excited onlookers, Malm took the opportunity to climb up onto the head of the his prize and deliver a lecture on whales. The whale’s organs were preserved in barrels in the yard of the museum, its skin was treated over a number of weeks, the baleen was hung and salted, and the skeleton was boiled and cleaned. Meanwhile a great wooden frame was built in rough whale shape and completed with a hinged jaw. The skin was stretched over the frame, held together by brass tacks like a leather sofa. The hinged jaw was made to be opened to allow visitors to descend into the belly of the beast, which was comfortably outfitted with benches, carpeting, and wall-hangings. The Malm Whale spent many years traveling around Europe, inviting the curious in for a chance to experience Jonah’s fate, before finally making its home at the Göteborg Natural History Museum, where it still sits today. Originally the whale’s jaw was open all of the time, and the attraction drew people far and wide. Sometime in the 1930’s a couple was found “making love” inside the creature, and from then on, the museum decided to only open him up on special occasions, like Swedish election days. Of the amorous natural history enthusiasts, a chairman of the museum commented, “We must be content with the fact that it was two citizens of our own city that enjoyed this privilege.”  The museum is free to enter, check the website for opening hours.",whale bones whales skeletons natural history museums taxidermy natural history animals

No, not mass: bar service. Welcome to Omnipollo’s Church (Omnipollos kyrka). It all began in 2008, when a few friends started brewing beer together at home in what they called Sundbybergs köksbryggeri (The Sundbyberg Kitchen Brewery). Their original “brewery” was, as the name suggests, a household kitchen. But it wasn’t long before the budding beer entrepreneurs had outgrown their humble digs, and found themselves on the hunt for a new location. The brewers aimed for a basement that could house 110-gallon (500-liter) equipment, but no such place could be found. Then came an unlikely suggestion: Why not use the neighborhood’s old, empty church? There was only one question: how to support the complex requirements of modern brewing in a setting more fit for consecration than fermentation? So began a serious renovation project. The brewers decided to increase their capacity, replacing the old church’s floors, installing drains, and bringing in brewing equipment that could handle up to 330 gallons (1,500 liters).

279,Kymlinge Metro Station,"Stockholm, Sweden","""Only the dead get off at Kymlinge.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kymlinge-metro-station,"Most urban legends are based solely on the fevered imaginations of the nervous and superstitious. But the Kymlinge Metro Station, a supposed ghost station, and Silverpilen, the silvery train that is said to haunt its rails, are both quite real. In an effort to urbanize the area of Kymlinge, near Stockholm, construction began on a partly above-ground metro station. Yet due to the already extreme suburbanization of other areas of Stockholm and efforts to maintain the natural areas of Kymlinge, construction was stopped after the majority of the structure was created. Plans for the station were scrapped, but the structure was left in place should feelings ever change. It wasn’t long after it was abandoned that the ghost stories started popping up. There are a number of tales about the Kymlinge Station, but the most prominent of them involves another urban legend that was also very real. Kymlinge Station is said to be home to Silverpilen (The Silver Arrow), a silvery ghost train that is said to have been seen all around the Stockholm Metro. Because it was. Silverpilen was a standard subway train car that, unlike the rest of the Metro fleet, had never been painted green, retaining its silver aluminium shine. It was used as a back-up car when the system was overloaded or a car had to go out of commission, so people could go years without seeing it, making it seem pretty damn spooky when they finally did. The basic beats of the ghost story usually go something like this: a young woman, after a late night of partying, gets on an old, silver-white train and sees that the other passengers look a little funny. When the train doesn’t stop at any of the regular stations she panics, but the other passengers don’t react. The train eventually stops at Kymlinge, and the passengers move right through the stations locked doors and disappear. Depending on what version of the story you hear the girl is either found dead or insane in the surrounding woods of Ursvik. As it’s been said, “Only the dead get off at Kymlinge.” You don’t really have to be dead to visit the Kymlinge Station. In fact, the station isn’t even abandoned, just indefinitely delayed. If you’re observant you can see the station while you travel to Akalla. Just look out the window after the train leaves Hallonbergen. You can also walk to it from nearby Hallonbergen or Kista. The station is usually locked, but can be seen from the outside.  The station is closed for visitors but you can get close to the fence. Don't try to get over, the metros go very fast and even if you don't get hit, you'll traumatize the metro driver.",ghost stories ghosts haunted trains abandoned

The pebbles of Neptuni Åkrar were created as a result of stones left behind during the last ice age, which eroded down to their present shape by the waves over the centuries. During summer, the otherwise barren and colorless coast transforms into a sea of brilliant blue, as the viper’s bugloss, or blueweed, flowers bloom. The area was named by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1741 in honor of Neptune, the Roman god of the sea. Today the beautiful alien landscape is a nature reserve featuring several ancient monuments, most notably, the sprawling grave field on the southern border of the reserve. This ancient burial ground is filled with various cists and cairns, Viking-era graves, stone circles, and a Bronze Age ship-shaped burial mound called the Forgalla Skepp (Forgalla Ship). The beach is also rich with fossils, including numerous trilobite and brachiopod fossils.  Neptuni Åkrar is on the coast and therefore likely to be windy. It is also a nature reserve so visitors should respect the area and not litter or take home rocks as souvenirs. It's best to visit in June if you want to see the blueweed blossoms.

281,Stockholm Observatory,"Stockholm, Sweden","When this 18th-century observatory's meridian was moved, it set Sweden's time back by 0.04 seconds.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stockholm-observatory,"Stockholm’s oldest observatory, a bright orange building that crowns a hilltop, was completed in 1753. It looks like a castle capped with a single dome. The observatory was built not to help astronomers understand the universe, but to map its movements and chart the stars. This practice allowed astronomers to deduce the time accurately. To do this, a special meridian telescope was created and a meridian line was drawn. This was the prime meridian of Sweden until Greenwich became the world’s standard in 1884. At first, the meridian line was on the right side of the building and passed through a small meridian building that was attached to the main structure. It was defined as the line that ran exactly north-south through the meridian telescope. All time measurements were taken by measuring the exact moment that a star passed this line. This is the exact same method as sailors used with their sextants. Oddly enough, the Stockholm meridian hasn’t always been in the same place. In 1878, it was shifted 59 feet (18 meters) west of its original location. It was moved because the old meridian telescope was being replaced and the new one was put on the other side of the building. Since it was too much of a hassle to adjust all measurements to match the old line, the astronomers voted instead to move the meridian. This effectively changed the Swedish time by moving it 0.04 seconds back. Fortunately, people did not notice this small change, but today such an alteration would be enough to disorient GPS and other location services.  Entrance to the grounds is free. There is a cafe in one of the satellite buildings and an amateur astronomer club in the other. If there are people there, feel free to talk to them. The main building is only accessible during open days; currently, this is once a month on the 20th. In 2018, the city purchased it and plans to turn it into a museum.",time observatories astronomy science
282,Rök Rune Stone,"Ödeshög, Sweden",This encrypted monolith protected a secret of Norse mythology by hiding in a church wall for over a millennium.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rok-rune-stone,"What was once building material in a church wall in the Swedish countryside is today a unique piece of history, telling stories of battles, kings and heroes long gone. Yet for centuries, passersby were unaware that this monolith contained a secret piece of old Norse mythology that had lain dormant for more than a millennium, forgotten by locals and scholars alike thanks to its encrypted etchings. The Rök Rune Stone is unlike any other archaeological find in the world. It’s believed to have been carved in the first half of the 9th century, but as the old Norse belief system began losing ground to Christianity, the stone’s mythological purposes were forgotten. It was unceremoniously repurposed into building material for a church in the 12th Century. There it stayed until 1843, when a team of construction workers discovered that the odd rock had carvings on five sides, not just the one visible to the eye. At that time, workers made a sketch of what they could see of the stone before, once again, re-embedding the stone into the church wall. Only in 1862 was the stone finally removed and put on display in the open churchyard, where it remains today. After a century and a half of study, scholars have discovered many of the Rök Rune Stone’s previously guarded secrets. Ranking among the world’s oldest runic inscriptions in stone, the story it relates is one of Gods, war and a father losing his son in a battle, belonging to what is believed to be a fragment of an old Norse mythology long forgotten. The tale also makes a reference to the Ostrogothic king, the emperor of the western Roman Empire Theodoric the Great. Though scholars are uncertain why this would have been the case, it appears the inscription on the Rök Rune Stone was encrypted during the carving process; its scribes used special ciphers that made the story appear purposefully displaced, thereby making it harder to read for the average reader. While archeologists have been deciphering the Rök Rune Stone’s contents, etymologists have been hard at work on a different conundrum. In a peculiar turn of phrase, they’ve traced the history of the stone’s name to the people who discovered it in the church wall, who gave it the same name as the nearby village of Rök. Though this makes complete sense, a long ago the village took its name from the stone. It has been found that the stone – pre- rediscovery in the church wall – was called “rauk” or “rök” in old Norse, which meant “skittle-shaped stack/stone.” In essence, the rock was named after the village, which was named after the rock, whose name is Rök which means a rock or stone.",mythology archaeology
283,Ytterby Mine,"Stockholm, Sweden",The single richest source of elemental discoveries in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ytterby-mine,"Army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius was excited when, in 1787, he came across a strange heavy black rock in an old quarry near the Swedish village of Ytterby. Arrhenius named the newly discovered “earth” (the idea of elements had not yet been discovered) Yttrium after the town. As it would turn out, the mine in which Arrhenius discovered Yttrium would go on to reveal many more strange and exotic elements, such as Ytterbium, Terbium, and Erbium. Thulium (“Thule” being a Latin name for the Nordic countries), Gadolinium, (named after Professor Johan Gadolin), Scandium, and Holmium (from the Latin name for Stockholm) were all derived from samples taken from the Ytterby Mine, making this the single richest source of elemental discoveries in the world.

It’s not just the climate and the flowers that draw in visitors and pique the curiosity of others, though. In a place this small - the island is about 80 miles long and 40 miles wide - it’s strange to find such an extensive array of historical remains. The Island has 400 Bronze Age mounds or cairns, 350 ship graves, 70 Iron Age forts, and 100 or more Romanesque and Early Gothic churches. It also has Scandinavia’s best known stone maze, Trojeborg, as well as unique “picture stones,” which are memorial stones of the first millennium CE. You might not think that a small island in the Baltic could have much in common with even smaller islands in the Pacific. But when it comes to archaeological heritage, there are plenty of issues to share. Increasingly, how to protect these unique landscapes rich in ancient artifacts from the onslaught of tourism is a theme that unites them. The population of the island is less than sixty thousand, but tourism is the primary source of income. Oddly enough, Gotland has also been one proposed site of Atlantis because of its unique history, size, and climate.",ruins architectural oddities architecture

IT IS PLANNED TO OPEN AGAIN IN THE AUTUMN 2022. THE COLLECTIONS WILL ONLY BE SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS DURING THIS PERIOD. Despite its candy-colored paint job, the University of Uppsala’s anatomical theater has, to some, been a nightmarish theater of horror for going on four centuries now.  Up under the cupola of the Gustavianum Museum, executed criminals and other unfortunates were once dissected under the public gaze. Upstaged only by Italy’s Palazzo del Bo, the anatomical theater is the second oldest in the world, built in the 1660s as part of Uppsala University. The octagonal tiers on the top floor of the building were meant to give all visitors a good view of the gruesome proceedings. The last of the blood has long been cleaned up, though, and it’s now the highlight of an eccentric museum. The Gustavianum has a little bit of everything, sourced from collections acquired by the university since its foundation. There are Egyptian mummies, Viking artifacts, scientific instruments, and, perhaps best of all, an incredible curiosity cabinet. Called the Augsburg Art Cabinet, it was gifted to King Gustav II Adolf in 1632 by the town of Augsburg. It’s covered in gemstones and has many little drawers, secret compartments, and holes that hold thousands of objects, all relating to the knowledge of the time. As anatomical theaters fell out of fashion, Gustavianum’s complex was repurposed by the university library in the late 18th century. After a turn in the 19th century as a zoological museum, the Anatomical Theater was restored to its original (retired) state in the 1950s. In 1997, the entire building became a museum, accompanied by a permanent collection pertaining to medical history to supplement the theater; though not for the squeamish, the exhibition contains a unique selection of dissected animals, scientific instruments, and medical devices from the theater’s heyday. Update as of October 2019: The museum is closed for long-term renovations with plans to reopen autumn 2022.

287,Säter Museum of Mental Health,"Säter, Sweden",A museum dedicated to the history of psychiatric treatment featuring a gallery of art made by patients.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sater-museum-of-mental-health,"In the early 20th century in Sweden, a team of doctors was sent out to survey what parts of the country mental disorders were most commonly found. In the process they saw the most horrific examples of how the mentally ill were treated, one being a 12-year-old girl kept in a cage by her family. The city of Säter was chosen as the ideal location to build a state-of-the-art psychiatric hospital. The facility’s philosophy was to treat mental illness with clean air, cleanliness, food, and rest. The site was chosen for, among other things, its beautiful nature. The Swedish government built a number of mental hospitals during the early 20th century, many of them massive facilities. When Säter’s hospital opened in 1912, it had space for 830 patients—almost equal the population of Säter, which had 1,000 inhabitants at the time. Unfortunately the psychiatric hospital was not free from cruel and questionable methods of its own. Insulin shock therapy to produce coma and convulsions was used as well as electric shock therapy and lobotomy. Additionally, the hospital was constructed with thick walls and a closely guarded gate to keep patients from escaping. The introduction of new medicines in the 1950s would change the treatment of mental illness. In 1967, the responsibility for mental health care was transferred to county councils. During the 1970s, the Swedish system of institutionalized mental health care came under increasing scrutiny. The focus shifted to reducing inpatient care in favor of more open care. The hospital had shut down by the 1980s. Today, one of the buildings at the former hospital has been converted into a museum dedicated to mental care. Here visitors can see traces of the darker history, like devices used for lobotomy of patients. The exhibition also features stories about the patients and how some of them found peace in their life at the hospital. Most notably, the exhibition also features art made by the patients, offering an insight into their inner selves. Update as of June 2021: The museum is currently closed indefinitely.  Update June 2021: The museum is currently closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Säter Museum of Mental Health is located outside of the town of Säter in Sweden.

Built in 1876, the humble house for holy men started getting its first reported hauntings in 1927 when the resident vicar reported strange happenings including his laundry being torn from the line. Tales of supernatural events continued in the ensuing decades with almost every new vicar or their family or guests claiming to experience ghostly antics. Things have moved, screams have been heard, shadow people have been seen, and the old rocking chair keeps on rocking. The legends surrounding the origins of the haunting tell of abused maids and even of babies buried in the backyard although it is now also said that the old vicars themselves haunt the house. In the early 1980’s the renowned site caught the attentions of an outsider priest named Tore Forslund, the ghostpriest. This devoted enemy of the occult came to the town promising to rid it of the apparitions that the citizens had already begun capitalizing on. Unfortunately his exorcism’s seem to have met with little to no success and he left the area within a year. Today the vicarage is run as a small bed and breakfast for those curious enough to stay the night, with the option to rent the whole house.

Maybe it was the City Council, who came around to see the value of preserving poignant and photogenic decay of old Saabs and Volvos. Or maybe it was simply some bad weather. The story of the car cemetery begins with Åke Danielsson, who lived in the village of Ryd in southern Sweden. In 1935 he bought a piece of forested peat bog, where he harvested the natural fuel and fertilizer by hand. As demand grew, “Åke on the Bog” upped production by building himself a peat shredder using old car engines. With the post-war years came a boom in car ownership, and the village of Ryd’s old cast-offs were often abandoned to the surrounding forest. Åke started gathering them up, and with no training in engines or auto mechanics—he didn’t even have a driver’s license—he learned all he could from the old junkers. A little side business in spare parts caught on, and soon he had a skrotbilar – loosely translated, a “scrap yard”—and the parts business outstripped the peat. The collection grew until 1974, the year Åke bought his last car. Over time the empty shells took on an aesthetic life of their own, attracting tourists and shutterbugs. Even though Åke had been keenly aware of the risk of contamination to his peat bog, careful to always remove the gas, oil and batteries, City Hall wasn’t so keen on the whole setup. They decided the cars had to be sent to an authorized recycling site, imposing a fine if it wasn’t done by a November 1998 deadline. That’s when some bad weather struck. The plan had to be postponed, which gave Åke’s supporters valuable lobbying time. All kinds of people rallied to his defense, including journalists, photographers, and even the director of the Småland Museum in nearby Växjö. The voices of support won out, and a 49-year permit for the site was issued. Åke Danielsson passed away in 2000, but not before seeing his scrap heap saved from the scrap heap. What’s to happen after the year 2047 is anyone’s guess, but the skrotbilar is staying put. At least for the time being. The Kyrkö Car Cemetery can be found driving west on Värendsgatan 2 (Hwy 119) from the town of Ryd in southern Sweden.

Descartes was a brilliant mind but not quite a brilliant businessman; toward the end of his life he was poor and living in the Netherlands, having lost most of what he owned. Then in 1649, the young Queen Christina of Sweden invited him to move to her country to tutor her in the ways of the ancient Greek philosophers. Unfortunately, the two did not click, as the queen felt unmoved by Descartes’s cold logic and found his lessons dull. On top of that, she insisted that the philosopher teach her in the early morning before 5 a.m., knowing very well that due to his fragile health he rarely got out of bed before noon. Descartes was often found complaining about the conditions he had to work under and how the cold and dark Scandinavian mornings would be the death of him. Technically, he was not wrong. In January 1650 he caught a bad case of pneumonia, a mere five months after he moved to Sweden and only four sessions into his lessons with the queen. Unfortunately, Descartes did not recover from this disease and died the following month, to the great despair of the French, who are said to have never truly forgiven Sweden for this crime. The philosopher’s body was temporarily kept in Sweden but eventually smuggled back to France where it can be found today. The house where Descartes lived during his time in Sweden can still be seen in Stockholm’s Gamla Stan, or Old Town.

The gravel ridge known as Fjaras Bracka is marked with over a hundred standing gravestones, raised in memory of the long forgotten dead. The late Iron Age burial site known as the Li Grave Stones once contained over 200 standing stones. Over the centuries, locals pillaged the valuable building material for other projects until now a little over 100 remain. The largest among them is known as Frodestenen, or “Frode’s Stone” and stands nearly 5 meters tall. Named for the legendary Danish King Frode mentioned in Snorri Sturluson’s Prose Edda, the stone was originally an estimated 7 meters high, but it broke some time in the 18th century. Called “bauta stones” in Scandinavian tradition, standing stones were also raised during the Viking era in memory of fallen warriors and great men. Although the stones clearly pre-date the Viking Era, local mythology has long associated the site with Viking battles and burials. Excavations of burials at the site have produced bits of bone, iron and bronze weapons and assorted other items dating both from the Iron and Viking Ages.

Many famous warriors were born from this era, names that haven’t been forgotten even centuries later. Local legends, television shows, and movies keep the memory and lore of these ancient figures alive today. Although, some of the history surrounding these heroes can be questioned, as ancient stories and people often merged over time into one mythical hero. Known as one of the perhaps mythical Viking kings of Sweden, Bjorn was the son of king Ragnar Lofbrok, who may have also been a mashup of various historical Viking figures. According to sources, Bjorn ruled over Sweden during the 9th century and may have started the Munsö Dynasty. Bjorn’s classic moniker was derived from the belief that he was rarely wounded in battle, in fact, it was thought that he was invulnerable to any wound. The largest mound on the island of Munsö located in lake Mälaren is said to be the final resting place of this legendary Viking. The mound is part of an old collection of graves that consists of around 45 smaller mounds. A total of 150 remains have been found inside the mounds, including various valuables and artifacts. On the site is also a fragmented runestone that reads ’[Thou] rgutr, you … … breath and God [s’]’. Unlike some of the better-known burial mounds in Scandinavia, Björn Järnsidas hög is not well maintained. It’s mostly overgrown by trees and devoid of any signage, however, the legend of this Viking king has not been forgotten. Update as of April 2020: The runestone has been restored and repainted.

Ragnhildsholmen was a strategic fortress built by the Norwegian king Håkon V during the 13th-century. Håkon and the Swedish king, Magnus Ladulås, had a friendly relationship. Håkon gave the fortress to the king’s son, Duke Erik, in 1304. Some time later, the friendly relationship ended, and Håkon tried to violently recapture it. The fight continued, and Ragnhildsholmen was only used for less than 100 years. It was likely abandoned by a large fire or by taking the stones to another fortress, Bohus, on the other side of the river. It wasn’t rediscovered until centuries later, in the 1800s, an excavation team led by the archeologist Wilhelm Berg found coins, weapons, tools, and other ancient artifacts on the site. Today, Ragnhildsholmen is a sanctuary for birds, including nightingales, warblers, and harriers. In the spring, kids can catch tadpoles along the stream that goes on the path from the road to the castle. The view is beautiful on the top of the hill. You can see the flat country landscape of northern Hisingen on one side, to the town of Kungälv on the other side of the river Nordre Älv. You can climb around the ruins and explore it yourself. This piece of Bohusian heritage is surprisingly unknown. There are not many visitors to this place, so you can almost have the hill for yourselves most of the time.  Spring and summer are the best time to visit. The ruins are located along Kongahällavägen road; follow signs for Säve. There is a small parking lot at the site.",wildlife sanctuaries vikings fortresses birds castles ruins animals
297,Villa Villekulla,"Kneippen, Sweden","Visit the home of Sweden's beloved fictional character, Pippi Longstocking.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/villa-villekulla,"Tucked away in Gotland, Sweden is the colorfully painted home of a beloved fictional character, Pippi Longstocking. Created by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren, Pippi Longstocking was the star of a series of children’s books Lindgren authored back in the 1940s. The red-haired, freckled Pippi was inspired by Lindgren’s own daughter, Pippi, who is said to have asked her mom for a get-well story that served as the basis for the forthcoming series. Much like Peter Pan, Pippi is a spunky girl who is averse to growing up, choosing instead to live in a yellow and pink-hued home with her pet horse and monkey. Fans of the Swedish series can step into Pippi’s fantasy by visiting the Villa Villekulla Museum in Gotland. Villa Villekulla is the original house that was used for the filming of the ‘modern’ Pippi Longstocking movies. The house was built in 1902 as an officers’ residence and was later bought and renovated for the Pippi TV series that aired in 1969. Later, the house was bought and moved to its current location in Kneippbyn where it was used as an exterior set for the movies ‘Pippi and the Seven Seas’ and ‘Pippi on the Run’. In 2001-2002, the villa was renovated with the intention of turning the home into a museum to honor the Pippi Longstocking legacy.  Villa Villekulla is found in Kneippbyn, a popular amusement park in the town of Visby. For those keen to visit Pippi's home, a ticket is required to enter the theme park. With the park offering other attractions and a water park, the ticket earns you more than just a visit to Villa Villekulla. In the warmer Summer months, Villa Villekulla presents three Pippi-inspired plays daily (performed in Swedish) for kids to enjoy.",pippi longstocking sweden children's literature week children's literature children history
298,Love Locks of Västerbron,"Stockholm, Sweden",A former suicide bridge is now accumulating symbols of love instead of a body count.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/love-locks-of-vasterbron,"Love locks can be found in cities all over the world but usually not on a bridge mostly known for the suicides committed there. Stockholm’s Västerbron Bridge has long maintained a reputation for being a nice place to jump off of. Among others, Anders Göthberg, the guitarist of the Swedish cult indie band Broder Daniel took his life here in March 2008, by taking a header off of the span. In 2012 the city of Stockholm added fences on top of the existing ones on the east side of the bridge just to prevent people from jumping off. The next year similar fences were added to the west side of the bridge as well and it seemed to have had an effect—12 attempted suicides were reported August - September 2012 but only three the next year when the fences were in place. Regardless of its grim reputation, the bridge, like many of its kind around the world, has begun to accumulate a collection of love locks attached to its railings. These padlocks are put in place by swooning romantics as symbols of their everlasting love. Even with the romantic intention, this tradition has damaged countless bridges around the world, although the Västerbron seems to be holding up okay so far. The love locks may one day damage the structure of the bridge, but for the time being, they seem to be less destructive than the reputation for suicide the bridge was accumulating previously. The love locks can be found on the east side of the bridge. The closest metro station is Hornstull on the red line southbound from Stockholm central station. From there it's a 10-15 minutes walk to the love locks.",love locks suicide bridges

Stand in the center of the room, and you’ll hear everything that is said around you, and everyone will also hear you.

300,Sala Silver Mine Hotel Suite,"Sala, Sweden",This luxury hotel suite is located deep in the bowels of an old mine.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sala-silver-mine-hotel-suite,"Apart from the intercom on the wall, staying in this cavernous hotel suite is a bit like spending a night in the Mines of Moria (minus the Balrog). The relatively small room, situated 155 meters (508 feet) underground, took miners a painstaking ten years to carve out, given the time-consuming mining method called fire-setting that they used. Little did they know that people would one day pay to go down the mine shaft and sleep there for the night. The world’s deepest hotel suite is found in the Swedish town of Sala, which for centuries was home to the largest and most important silver mine in the country. By the twentieth century, however, the precious ore had run out, leaving behind a honeycomb of empty tunnels and excavated chambers. Now, you can spend the night in one of those chambers—in considerably more comfortable conditions than the miners had experienced when they hollowed it out. The bedrock around Sala has long been known to be rich in silver, and organized mining began as early as the 16th century. Productive over the course of four centuries, the mine grew to eventually a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) with over 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of tunnels. The mining ended in 1908 and today the mine serves as a tourist attraction with guided tours, concerts, and an unlikely subterranean luxury hotel room. For the rest of 2020 the mine and hotel are closed for renovations. The suite is furnished with a luxurious double bed, champagne and, of course, silver furnishings. While the temperature of the surrounding tunnels sits at a constant, chilly 2°C (35°F), the hotel room sits in a warm pocket of air that keeps it at a comfortable 18°C (64°F). Naturally, there is no cell phone service that far underground. The only means of communication with the outside world is an intercom that can be used to contact a staff member that stands on call and at the ready throughout the stay. Update as of July 2020: The mine and hotel are closed for the rest of 2020 for renovations.",subterranean underground mines places to stay hotels subterranean sites
301,Vikingaliv Runestone,"Stockholm, Sweden",Outside a Viking museum sits a modern-day runestone made by a Swedish runemaster using traditional methods.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vikingaliv-runestone,"Sweden is full of Viking runestones made by ancient Swedes now long forgotten. These carved monuments could be erected to celebrate an important achievement or event or as a sort of gravestone memorializing a lost loved one. It is an art that has not been practiced for hundreds of years—or so you might think. The Vikingaliv runestone was created by a modern-day runemaster using traditional methods, which essentially comes down to hundreds of hours of painstaking chiseling. The large granite stone, which weighs 6 tonnes, is located outside the Vikingaliv museum (roughly meaning “Viking life”) in Stockholm. The museum is close to both the Uppland and Södermanland provinces, which traditionally used different motifs in their runestones. Thus a mix of the two was used for the design of the Vikingaliv stone, so that the style you’ll see is completely unique but still recognizable. The image on the stone depicts two dragons holding a pair of people. The dragons are bound to the stone by various snakes that are knotted around them and a large central serpent. The motif is based on the Runestone U 629, which is thought to depict a long-forgotten saga. This was done in order to connect the museum to the past and spread the lost story in the hopes that someone might recognize it. The stone was made by Kalle Runristare, a modern-day runemaster who restores and replaces runestones all across Sweden. It was commissioned by the Vikingaliv, a museum dedicated to the life and culture of these ancient seafaring Norsemen. The museum collection includes many historic items and replicas of newer ones, as well as an indoor ride that tells the saga of a Viking woman.  The stone is located in front of the Vikingaliv museum in the Östermalm district of Stockholm and is freely accessible.",writing vikings rocks geology museums

The old industry track was built between 1925 and 1940. It stretches from the top northeastern tip of the Södermalm and arcs to the southwest. It begins near the harbor, as the idea was that wounded men arriving via ship to the harbor could be ferried away to an underground disaster center hidden beneath the hospital. But no ships full of wounded World War II soldiers ever arrived. The railway did see some violence, though, as it was one of the places bombed by the Soviets during the February bombings of 1944. The city has made several requests to remove the train tracks to construct houses in their place. The request keeps being denied, leading the city to find other uses for the space. Marathons have been held there, as well as theater shows and art exhibits. Proposed plans for the tunnel include a pedestrian path, concert hall, and even a ski trail.  The closest subway station is ""Skanstull"" on the green line. Walk into the park and go south until you see the bridge, below the bridge you will see the track.

They were engraved in the late 1800s by Alfred Bexell, a landowner and member of Parliament. He had two stonemasons engrave hundreds of stones and rocks in a forest on his property — why he did this is unknown until this day, but it is believed that he wanted to share his interest in history, philosophy and aphorisms with generations to come. The engravings were forgotten for decades until a few of the moss-covered letters were discovered in 1925 by a family on picnic in the forest. So far over 600 names of famous writers, philosophers, scientists, politicians and statesmen been identified in the carvings, as well as more than 180 aphorisms, sayings, quotes from literature and pieces of Bexell’s own thoughts like a sort of petrous journal. They include messages like, “Do not say all you know but always know what you say” and “What is sleep but the image of death.” The summer of 2014 marked the start of an ongoing work to discover, clean and fill in the engravings to make them easier to find. From Bexell’s own notes it is clear that there are more of them out there to discover. Alfred Bexell himself died in 1900 at 69 years old. The last message he left to the world was the one on his tombstone saying “Man’s history is his character.” The map shows position of the parking lot next to the area where the stones can be found. There are leaflets in Swedish, English and German with a map over the area and a few translated engravings.

You can identify the smells of the battlefield—yes, they do have an interactive sniffing exhibit for smells such as corpse, mud, and blood—look into the eyes of a taxidermied warhorse killed in battle, and feel the weight of Swedish armor The museum winds its way through Sweden’s history by focusing on the country’s monarchs, queens, and kings. One of the crown jewels of the museum concerns Queen Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg. After the tragic death of her husband, King Gustavus Adolphus, Maria wrapped his heart in a cloth and kept it in storage. It hung over her bed, safely enclosed within a golden coffin. Throughout the following years, as other monarchs battled her for the throne, Queen Maria would pull out the heart, explain her grief, and be granted a few more years without a king. The cloth that held King Gustavus Adolphus’ heart is displayed in the Armory, as are the clothes the king wore when he was slain in battle. The outlines of his organ are still visible on the white cloth.

305,Visingsö Oak Forest,"Jönköping N, Sweden",A forest of immensely tall and unusually straight oak trees planted nearly 200 years ago to build naval ships that never came to be.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/visingso-oak-forest,"There is good reason that oak has traditionally been used in shipbuilding. The wood is incredibly strong, and if tended just right, the grain is straight and true. Going back to the Vikings, the slow-growth trees have been used in Sweden for vessels of all kinds, including naval ships. On the lake island of Visingsö there are hundreds of acres of tall and orderly oaks, all planted with an eye to the long game. It was around 1830, soon after the end of the devastating Napoleonic Wars, and the Swedish Crown sent out a delegation to search for ideal spots to plant for future ship production. Three of those emissaries came to a small croft on Visingsö, a narrow island in the middle of Vättern (Sweden’s second largest lake). Here they spied three magnificent oaks just outside of an old woman’s farmhouse. They took one with them back to Stockholm, and it didn’t take much to convince the Royal Navy that Visingsö had nearly perfect conditions for lumber production. Over the next ten years, 300 000 oak trees were planted. Knowing how slowly the trees grow, the Navy was thinking awfully far ahead to supply itself with material to keep afloat well into the 20th century. But by the time the trees were ready, almost 150 years later, they showed no interest in using them, having long converted to ship hulls crafted from iron and steel. Back in the 19th century, to make the oak suitable for ship production, other species such as ash, elm, maple, beech and silver fir were planted between the rows, to force growth up rather than spreading out. Today the forest, nearly 900 acres (360 hectares), has immensely tall and unusually straight trees. And even if they never see the ocean from the bottom of a boat, the wait hasn’t been for naught. The lumber is ideal for flooring, veneers, furniture, and even whiskey barrels. Visingsö is only accessible by boat from the town of Gränna on the eastern shore of lake Vättern in southern Sweden. You can bring the car but the oak forest, and many other sights, are close to the harbor.

Deep into the forests of the region of Värmland in Sweden, lies this well-hidden car cemetery. Hundreds of cars from the 1940s, 50s, and 60s are spread out in the area, some of them covered with moss, with trees growing through them, stacked on top of each other or placed side by side. While it has not been confirmed, many of the cars are said to have belonged to the US military who left the autos after World War II.  People interested in cars, artists, and photographers come here from near and far to take it in and be inspired. However, the peaceful setting is not without its threatening aspects. The auto graveyard is said to be owned by a pair of reclusive brothers whose homes are also located on the swath of land. They do not seem to be interested in the spotlight, but they also do not seem to mind photographers coming to enjoy their jalopy collection. Yet they have very strict rules about taking anything away or messing with the cars at all really. Previously nailed to a door, on one of the buildings were three seat covers scrawled with the owners’ message to visitors: “This car cemetery is private property.

The Wooden Horse Museum in Stockholm’s Old Town is nestled in a backroom of Runstenen, a crystal and craft souvenir shop. While it may seem like just another tourist attraction, this museum is dedicated to exploring the rich history and cultural significance of Dala horses. On display throughout the museum are several dozen antique horses from a variety of artists, some of which were crafted as early as 1920. Small signs point out their age, region of origin, and if known, their maker. Painters would often leave specific patterns on a finished horse that served as their signature, sometimes making identification difficult. Larger signs located throughout the museum explain the history of crafting these horses and the method in which they were created. There is even a section dedicated to fake horses and how to distinguish them from the real deal, which is no easy task.

Visitors can see a real 11th century runestone in Terminal 2 of Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The runestone was discovered in 1990, while construction was being done on the motorway to Arlanda. Its inscription can be roughly translated as: “Gurnar and Björn and Thorgrim set up this stone in memory of Thorsten, their brother. He died in the east with Ingvar. And made this bridge” Bridge-building and road-laying were popular during the early Christianization of Sweden, as the church promised that doing these tasks would clear a person’s sins and guarantee them a spot in heaven. As a result, many runestones from this era mention the building of a road or bridge. Ingvar is a character who has been mentioned on dozens of runestones, mostly found in the Mälar region of Sweden. His expedition to the east seemingly came to a disastrous end, as none of the inscriptions that mention Ingvar describe a man who returned from the journey.  The stone is accessible as long as the terminal is open. If you land in another terminal and want to see it, just go to Terminal 2 and go to the right after the door.

Twenty apartment buildings were built, complete with district heating, electric stoves, refrigerators, toilets with running water, and a common HVAC system. There was a school, a grocery store, a swimming hall, and a cultural center with a cinema. The town, however, was short-lived. The nearby copper mine closed, thanks to a low concentration of copper in the ore and falling prices on the world market. After the mine closed, the locals moved away. Laver was torn down in 1947, only 10 years after it was constructed. Surprisingly, the area is still of interest to the mining companies.

Nevertheless it is still animated much like the neon signs seen everywhere today.

315,Sigurdsristningen (Sigurd Carving),"Eskilstuna, Sweden","Stone carvings record the Norse myth of Sigurd, providing a glimpse into Scandinavia's transition from paganism to Christianity.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sigurdsristningen-ramsund-carving,"The legend of Sigurd is a core component of both Norse and Germanic mythology (with the figure known as Siegfried in the latter), and is included in texts from the Poetic Edda to the Niebelunglied to Beowulf. Elements of the story has been incorporated, in whole or in part, into modern epics such as Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen and Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. Dating from the Viking Age, the Sigurd Stones are a group of runestones in eastern Sweden that provide the earliest Norse depictions of the legend of Sigurd the dragon slayer. The Sigurdsristningen (which translates to Sigurd Carving but is commonly called the Ramsund Carving) is unique among the Sigurd Stones in that it is the only runic carving in the group etched into a rocky outcrop, rather than a standing stone. Moreover, it was apparently commissioned to help a loved one’s soul reach Christian heaven. Carved sometime around 1030 CE, the Sigurdsristningen provides a pictorial account of the heroic feats of Sigurd the dragon slayer. As a displaced youth, Sigurd was fostered by a smith name Regin. Regin had a score to settle with his brother Fafnir, who murdered their father Hreidmar and stole the gold paid to their family as a settlement after the trickster god Loki killed their brother Ótr. The main hurdle for Regin was that Fafnir had subsequently turned into a dragon, thanks to a curse attached to a ring in the treasure horde. The good and impressionable Sigurd was enlisted to the cause, and armed with a magic sword forged by Regin. He killed Fafnir, cut out his heart, and, in the course roasting it, licked a bit of dragon blood from his fingers, which gave him the ability to speak with birds. Some nearby birds told him that Regin, also corrupted by the ring, was planning to betray and kill Sigurd, so Sigurd instead killed Regin and made off with the loot—carried on the back of a steed descended from Odin’s own horse—to engage in further adventures of similar grimness and complexity. This is the tale that the Sigurdsristningen tells in visual vignettes, showing Sigurd slaying Fafnir, tasting the dragon’s blood, talking to birds, killing Regin, and his horse laden with treasure, while Ótr hovers over the proceedings. However, the runic inscription in Fafnir’s body describes the carving as a “bridge” made by a woman named Alríkr for “the soul of Holmgeirr.” This is significant because, as Scandinavia became Christianized, Fafnir became interchangeable with Satan, and bridge-building projects were funded by the Church to gain local support as well as to represent the bridge they offered to the afterlife, which fit neatly in a culture accustomed to reaching the afterlife by boat.

316,Gävlebocken,"Gävle, Sweden","If there is one thing you don't want to be in Sweden during Christmas, it's a Yule Goat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gavle-goat,"The small Swedish town of Gävle harbors a history of repeated sustained vandalism, unexpected in the polite mild-mannered Nordic country. Making of Yule Goats, straw goat figures are an ancient Christmas tradition in Nordic countries, dating back probably even to pre-Christian times and pagan celebrations of winter solstice. In 1966 an advertising consultant, Stig Gavlén, came up with the idea of making a giant version a Yule Goat and placing it in the town square. Ironically the “chief engineer” on this project was his brother Jesper Gavlén, also the towns fire department chief. At the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve, the goat went up in flames. Thus the tragic history of Gävlebocken began. In the following years the goat has been burned a total of 23 times, in a few instances in mere hours after being assembled, sometimes even before being actually being built. In addition to that, it has been smashed to pieces several times, and once even run over by a car. Vandalizing of the Yule goat has become something of a dark tradition for the town. The organizers went through a long list of measures to try to protect the goat, or at least ensure its survival until Christmas. The list over the years includes protection by police, firemen, hired guards, bands of volunteers, webcams and fireproofing the material with chemicals. The price tag of goat construction went up tenfold in years between 1996 and 2005, reaching 100,000 Swedish kronor. The 2005 attack sparked the biggest wave of inanimate-goat violence in Sweden so far, with half a dozen copycat goat-burnings all over Sweden. Nowadays people can even place bets on the goat’s survival with certain Swedish and British bookmakers. Since 1986, two goats are built, one by a society of Southern Merchants and the other one by the Natural Science Club of Vasa School. This split is a result of the goats’ complicated history, though both goats suffer the same inevitable fate. In 2009, the Southern Merchants version survived an arson attempt on December 7. It was finally stolen on December 14. Someone tried to throw the Natural Science Club goat into the river on December 11. On December 23 this goat was torched after a coordinated DDoS attack on the two websites hosting live video webcam feeds. Nothing, it seems, can save the Yule goat.  The goat is there from December 1st until Christmas. Since 2019, there are also special street signs around the square where the goat is located. These hang year round.",goats christmas holidays rites and rituals
317,Katarina Elevator,"Stockholm, Sweden",This gem from the industrial age helps visitors and residents alike traverse hilly Stockholm.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/katarina-elevator-katarinahissen,"Stockholm is not a flat city, so much so that you can easily get lost just trying to go to the next street, looking for hidden staircases and steep ramps. Some attempts have been made to remedy this in the busier parts of town, the most iconic example being the Katarina Elevator, or Katarinahissen, a gigantic metal construction towering over passersby at Slussen, providing a much-appreciated shortcut between Katarinavägen and Mosebacke Torg. The original lift construction dates from 1881, at which time it was an extremely modern way of traveling. Initially, it was powered by a giant steam engine, but was upgraded to an electric motor in 1915. Sporting the modernistic name “Elevatorn,” the elevator drew many curious visitors. Roughly 1,500 people a day came to see the mechanical wonder during the first month of its opening, making the city a lot of money since a trip up or down cost 5 öre (about 2 dollars). The bridge to the elevator was seen as extremely valuable advertising real estate from the beginning, sporting ads for furs and other commodities. It was also the original location of the iconic animated Stomatol Toothpaste sign before it was moved to its current location. Over the years, the Katarinahissen construction became too weak to be used safely and eventually was demolished and replaced by the current lift, which resumed its operation in much the same way as before. Update as of July 2021: The building that the elevator is attached to is currently undergoing renovations and is currently not accessible.",elevators machines inventions urban planning cities engineering industrial infrastructure transportation bridges
