0,City Hall Station,"New York, New York","A beautiful and abandoned New York subway station from 1904, complete with chandelier.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-hall-station,"The first New York City subway was built and operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and opened on October 27, 1904, to the joy of New York elevated train and streetcar riders. The City Hall station on the IRT local track was lavished with fine architectural details, including glass tiles and large chandeliers. However, the Gustavino vaulted ceilings and skylights were lost on busy commuters, and the stop was one of the least-used in the system. It was the only station that did not have turnstiles installed by 1923, and the nearby Brooklyn Bridge stop was frequented by the express train and closer to connecting streetcars.  Because of the curved platform, cars with center doors could not be used at this station unless they had specially modified door controls which allowed just the end doors to be opened. In 1945, the station was closed when platforms along the line were being lengthened to accommodate longer trains, and the number of passengers using this station dwindled to very few. Another factor leading to the decline of the station’s use was the fact that a person boarding the train at City Hall with a station intended destination below City Hall or in Brooklyn would wind up on the uptown platform at the Brooklyn Bridge station. They would then have to go upstairs and down to the downtown platform to continue their journey. It was much easier to walk the short distance at street level to the Brooklyn Bridge station. Up until the late 1990’s the passengers on the Lexington Avenue Local (today’s 6 train) had to disembark from the train at the Brooklyn Bridge stop. That is no longer the case. The skylights have been reopened, and the station lights turned back on. While passengers can not get out of the train and experience the City Hall Station as they once might have, they can stay on the train as it loops around on those tracks and heads back north. The New York City Transit Museum hosts periodic tours of the abandoned station; however, you must be a member of the museum to attend. Check the website for details.  If you will be staying on the downtown 6 train after it leaves the Brooklyn Bridge station, it is best to be in the 7th, 8th or 9th car as the train operates very slowly around the curve in front of the City Hall station. Tour tickets are $50, and regular adult membership to the museum is $60.",subways subterranean infrastructure subterranean sites abandoned architectural oddities architecture
1,The Wave Organ,"San Francisco, California",A huge musical instrument played by the ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wave-organ,"Located on a jetty in the San Francisco Bay, the Wave Organ was built in 1986. In collaboration with the Exploratorium, artist Peter Richards built an acoustic sculpture that amplifies the sounds of the waves in the bay. The organ’s jetty was constructed with carved granite and marble from a demolished cemetery. Magnificently old and finely worked pieces form the irregular terraced seating and even a trash can holder. The instrument itself is comprised of more than 20 PVC and concrete pipes that extend down into the water at various elevations. The sound is created by waves crashing against the ends of these pipes. When the waves roll in, the pipes resound with liquid music: low, gurgling notes that ebb and flow with the restless movement of the ocean and the changing of the tides. What makes the music? It is similar to the phenomena of the sound heard in a conch shell—a specific volume of air resonating at a specific frequency. The same sort of thing happens in the pipes of the Wave Organ, but there is one important difference. In the Wave Organ, the columns of air within the pipes constantly change as the water moves in and out, and as the length and volume of the air column in each pipe changes, the pitch of the sound it produces also varies. The larger the volume of air, the lower the sound; the smaller the volume of air, the higher the sound.The park-like setting on the lee side of the breakwater has a view of San Francisco’s Marina District, downtown San Francisco’s skyline, the East Bay hills, Sausalito, Mt. Tamalpais, the Presidio, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Marin Headlands. Fishermen are often at the organ in the morning, which after the walk by the marina can feel like a detached place of peace within the city.  The acoustics of the wave organ are only active when the tide is in, and the music is best heard around high tide. Parking is available in the marina a short distance away. (There is a private marina club that has better access, but parking is closed off to the public at that point.) The organ is not far from the Crissy Field recreational area, which, if you have time, is about a 1.8-mile walk along the trail.",sea organ aletrail sounds music outsider art cemeteries art

Although this is not your typical dream house with a 4-door garage, it guarantees to be a one-of-a-kind experience, with its completely absorbing, constantly fluctuating sound waves accompanied by neon pink reflections of light. Created in 1993 by modern composer La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela (who are married to one another), this is the culmination of 40 years of their work. Zazeela explains that “together, the sound and light can be experienced as a new form or new media: the sound and light environment. The experience of the two mediums together as one requires a new, or at least different, mode of attention.” For example, unless you are completely still, be prepared to encounter a new collection of pitches with every move you make, as you encounter the various resonating sound fields created by Young. Young and Zazeela invite you to dive into their dream world, Wednesday through Saturday from 2PM-Midnight. Admission is $10.00– walk right in.

Enter The Last Bookstore, an iconic Los Angeles book shop with a not-so-subtly symbolic name that is housed in the grand atrium of what was once a bank. The marble pillars and mile-high ceiling remain from the old bank, but in place of patrons and guarded stacks of cash, bookshelves line the walls and artful displays of books abound. Not to imply that everything is brand new and sparkly. The bookstore actually specializes in reasonably priced used books, and takes great pride in offering a selection of well-kept vintage books as well. Anyone who’s ever loved a vintage book will know exactly what that means for the musty, decadent smell that hangs in the air in this seemingly sacred place. Almost as if to make a point about beauty in disarray, the bookshelves are placed every which way all throughout the store, and sculptures have been custom-built from overstocked or damaged copies. There are even hidden nooks, like the old bank vault itself, where books are winkingly displayed. There is a section of hardbacks arranged by color. Most of the fiction is purposefully unarranged, meant to inspire treasure hunts among shoppers.

Woken up in the morning and realized you’re fresh out of dinosaur eggs for breakfast? Discovered that your robot is out of milk…and has lost its toupee? Thankfully, The Echo Park Time Travel Mart has all the necessary supplies for your trip to the fourth dimension – and yes, that apparently includes robot toupees! Brought to you by 826, the same organization responsible for the Superhero Supply store in Brooklyn and the Pirate Supply Company in San Francisco, The Echo Park Time Travel Mart is a time travel-themed retail store that boasts the slogan, “Whenever you are, we’re already then.” The store sells humorous relics from the past, present and future, such as Barbarian Repellent, Michael Jordan pogs and varying Robot Emotions.

8,The Wave,"Marble Canyon, Arizona",Rippling sand dunes frozen in the Arizona rock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wave-rock,"190 million years ago, one of the greatest geological formations in the world began to take shape. In the Coyote Buttes ravine, some 5,225 feet above sea level, stands Arizona’s the Wave. The Wave has a remarkable undulating appearance, with massive sandstone structures stretched like taffy and cinnamon color strata domes. It is, in a way, a geological snapshot in time, a still shot of the effect natural forces have on the environment. The Wave is comprised of Navajo Sandstone dunes that have calcified vertically and horizontally, turning into hardened, compacted rocks over time. The peculiar and unique fluctuating stratum was created by slow wind and rain erosion. The Wave remained basically unknown until the 1990s when it was largely advertised in German travel brochures and shown in the 1996 movie Faszination Natur. Small groups of Europeans visited the area, and its popularity grew; tour guides confide that it is still largely a European population that visits, though Americans have definitely begun to take notice of the landscape. Many describe walking through the dunes as an intensely strange experience, surreal and vertigo inducing, or in several cases, described as being like a drug induced walking dream. The rock is certainly a photographer’s delight, where professionals and amateurs strive to take the perfect mid-day shot when not a single shadow eclipses the Wave, or they go for the more dramatic effect of morning or near-twilight that comes with the high domes casting stark shadows on the land. While the rocks have been hardened, they are still susceptible to damage. Only 20 visitors a day are allowed to walk through the ravine, and permits are required. The permits are issued through online and in person lotteries, and tour guides are available for hire.  When you obtain a permit, thorough directions are provided.",martian landscapes geological oddities ecosystems geology
9,Roosevelt Island Smallpox Hospital Ruins,"New York, New York",A crumbling hospital from the 1850s on Roosevelt Island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/roosevelt-island-smallpox-hospital-ruins,"Few diseases have had a greater impact on the history of human civilization than smallpox. The bubonic plague certainly wins for its baroque presentation. Malaria and HIV are concurrent with our times and thus feel more real. But smallpox takes the contamination cake. It has been around for more than 3,000 years in all parts of the world. Before the vaccine was discovered in 1796, more than 400,000 people a year died from smallpox in Europe alone. According to the World Health Organization, smallpox killed one in ten children in Sweden and France and one in seven in Russia. The disease killed Louis XV of France and other European monarchs. Queen Elizabeth I had the disease as a child and wore heavy make-up to conceal her pockmarks. In the French and Indian Wars, blankets containing smallpox were purposefully given to Delaware Amerindians, in an early instance of biological warfare. Through extensive worldwide vaccination efforts, the disease was eradicated in 1979 - the only disease to be completely eradicated through human intervention. By the end of the 1800s, efforts were made in Western Europe and the United States to eradicate the disease by universal vaccination. But before that time, many cities built hospitals specifically for treating smallpox sufferers. In New York City, the southern tip of Blackwell’s Island (now Roosevelt Island) provided ferry access but kept the infected patients far away from the population. Better known for Grace Church on Broadway and St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Madison Avenue, James Renwick Jr. designed the smallpox hospital in his Gothic Revival style. From 1856 until 1875, the hospital treated about 7,000 patients a year. In 1875, the building was converted into a nurses’ dormitory, and the city smallpox hospital was moved to North Brothers Island, in part because Blackwell’s Island had become more densely populated. By the 1950s, Renwick Hospital had become useless and was abandoned by the city, quickly falling into disrepair. However, in 1975, the Landmarks Preservation Commission took interest in the dilapidated structure and declared it, in its ruin, a city landmark. They reinforced the walls to prevent it from completely falling apart but have not renovated it or opened it for tours. Only some of the outer walls and the foundation remain today. It is behind a fence on the southern tip of Roosevelt Island.  Take the F to Roosevelt Island. Walk south along West Road to E Road. The hospital will be on your right.

10,The Winchester Mystery House,"San Jose, California",A peculiar mansion built by the troubled heir to the Winchester gun fortune.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/winchester-mystery-house,"In 1886 an eccentric woman named Sarah Winchester traveled from New Haven, Connecticut, to San Jose, California, to start a new life. She purchased a small eight-room farmhouse and started a small renovation project that would take 36 years and $5.5 million (in the money of the time), only stopping when she passed away in 1922. By the time she was done, the Winchester Mansion was a modern marvel with indoor plumbing, multiple elevators, a hot shower, and central heating. It had over 160 rooms and 40 bedrooms, 10,000 windows, and even 2 basements. Of course, that’s not all that’s unique about the house. Not all the 2,000 doors can be walked through—one leads to an 8-foot drop to a kitchen sink, another to a 15-foot drop into bushes in the garden below. Staircases lead straight to ceilings, expensive Tiffany stained-glass windows were installed in places where they would get no light, and there are more secret passages than Narnia. A particularly odd delight is a cabinet that, when opened, extends through 30 rooms of the house. No one is quite sure why Mrs. Winchester demanded constant changes to her very large house. Of course, there are stories. The most prevalent story is that Mrs. Winchester was being haunted by the spirits of those killed by the Winchester rifle, which her late husband’s company had invented. After her husband passed away, a psychic told her that to evade the spirits, she would have to move out west, buy a home, and build nonstop. Some theories say she believed that as soon as construction was complete, she would die, while other theories suggest she built the house like a maze in order to keep her paranormal tormentors at bay and lost in the many intricacies of the building. As the theory goes, to avoid them she would sleep in a different bedroom every night and take labyrinthine paths through her own home. A massive earthquake struck the Bay Area in 1906 and toppled the top three stories of the house, damaging the other four stories along with it. Some say Sarah Winchester took this as a sign from the spirits that she was too close to completion and ordered the unfinished front half of the house to be boarded up. Though it’s open now, signs of damage from the earthquake are still clearly visible. In response to the ongoing claims of ghostly encounters and other paranormal phenomena on the property, in the early 1990s the Winchester management had a parapsychologist and paranormal investigator named Christopher Chacon conduct a full-scale scientific assessment of the property. The month-long, round-the-clock investigation included interviewing over 300 people regarding their experiences on the property, and analyzed every aspect of the environment for any unusual phenomena. In 2018, a horror film was made about the infamous house and the spirits that live within.  A Mansion Tour ($20-39), Explore More Tour ($20-$39), and Garden Tour (free) are all available. (The Explore More tour is not available for children under nine.) There are also Flashlight Tours around Halloween and every Friday the 13th.

11,Eastern State Penitentiary,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","World's first ""penitentiary,"" meant to be humane, drove men insane.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eastern-state-penitentiary,"Thrust into the middle of urban Philadephia is what looks like a great castle, a massive and haunting building. However, these walls weren’t built to keep Crusaders and robbers out, but to keep them in. This castle is a prison. Until this edifice was constructed, prisons had generally been commercial ventures, filled with prostitutes, booze, corrupt officials, and little to no order. Starvation, cold, disease, and violence often put an end to prisoners before they were even sentenced. Opened in 1829, Eastern State was designed by the “Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons” as a new type of prison where order reigned and those housed within might have a chance to be penitent for their crimes. Eastern State was to be the world’s first “penitentiary.” Compared to other facilities, Eastern State was a technological marvel and, at a cost of $800,000, one of the most expensive building projects of its day. At a time when President Andrew Jackson was still using a chamber pot, prisoners in Eastern State had their own private toilets. Inmates were served three hearty meals a day (usually boneless beef, pork, or soup and unlimited potatoes) and had their own private exercise areas. The cells each had skylights so that the divine wisdom of God might shine down upon those inside. In essence, Eastern State was a paradise compared to other prisons of the time. But despite all its material comforts, this “paradise” drove men mad. Known as the “separate system,” part of what made Eastern State unique is that prisoners weren’t allowed to interact with other prisoners at all, in any way. They ate alone, they exercised alone, and they read the bible (the only book they were allowed) alone. They weren’t allowed to talk to each other or to the guards. On the rare occasions they were taken out of their cells, hoods were put over their heads. Guards even wore felt shoe covers so as to keep the prison as quiet as possible. Utter silence, utter solitude. It was meant to inspire penance; instead, it inspired insanity. When Charles Dickens visited the prison in 1842, he wrote, “The system here is rigid, strict, and hopeless solitary confinement. I believe it, in its effects, to be cruel and wrong. I hold this slow, and daily, tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body.” Eventually, due to overcrowding and disapproval of the “separate system,” Eastern State changed into a more standard prison, known then as the “New York System,” in which inmates shared cells and were permitted to communicate. The prison remained in use for 142 years, from 1829 until 1971, and housed such criminal luminaries as Willie Sutton and Al Capone (Capone was allowed a comparatively lavish cell with furniture, oil paintings, and a radio). Left abandoned for many years, it was narrowly saved from destruction, and in 1994 Eastern State re-opened its massive doors to the public. Left in a state of magnificent decay, anyone who finds themselves in Philadelphia would be well advised to pay a visit - and to be penitent. The self-guided audio tour features interviews with former inmates and guards, and is narrated by actor and director Steve Buscemi. The penitentiary offers a number of special tours, including “prison uprisings,” Winter Adventure Tours, a Bastille Day celebration, and a Haunted Halloween tour.

In a city where space is at a premium, there remains hidden away a lush garden of solitude, known to only a very few. Remarkably, this pleasant, quiet meadow can be found in the jostling streets of the busy Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Or more specifically, above it! The Elevated Acre is precisely that: a one-acre meadow flanked by delightfully designed gardens and plantings elevated above the city streets. Its entrance is fairly anonymous, an escalator at 55 Water Street, set back from the sidewalk. Currently surrounded by construction, passersby will often overlook it. But if you venture up the escalators you will find the marvelous Elevated Acre. The secretive urban oasis features a lawn, an amphitheater, a summer beer garden, winding paths of Brazilian hardwood, spectacular views of the East River, Brooklyn, and the Brooklyn Bridge, and above all, pleasant solitude.

13,Mütter Museum,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",America's most famous museum of medical oddities is home to the remains of Albert Einstein's brain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mutter-museum,"Located inside the headquarters of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, the Mütter Museum has a wide range of wondrous and curious medical displays. These include the skeleton of the tallest known man ever to have lived in North America and the fused bones of Harry Eastlack, who died of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, an extremely rare disorder in which the soft connective tissue of the body ossifies, painfully freezing the body in an immobile state. These and many other exhibitions are displayed in some of the same Victorian cabinets that the museum began with in 1858. Among the extensive collection is a set of brain slides curated not because of its defects, but because of its extraordinary brilliance. They look like strands of kelp, or shards of bark. But in fact, these slides contain slivers from the brain of the 20th century’s most famous scientist: Albert Einstein. Einstein probably wouldn’t have been pleased. He wanted to be cremated, and for the most part, he got his wish. (His ashes were scattered in a secret spot on the Delaware River.) However, the pathologist on duty the night Einstein died in Princeton, New Jersey, wanted to keep the great physicist’s brain away from the flames, so that others might one day study it for clues to his genius. The pathologist, Thomas Harvey, ended up embroiled in drama with Einstein’s family and executor, not to mention the hospital, but was eventually allowed to keep the brain as long as he used it only for scientific study (no tourist attractions allowed). At first, scientists who analyzed small sections of the gray matter saw nothing unusual, but by the 1980s, some began to find intriguing features in areas involved in visual, mathematical, and spatial processing. It turns out that Einstein’s Sylvian fissure (a prominent groove) was shorter than average, while his parietal lobes were slightly wider, and his left inferior parietal lobe richer in glial cells (which nourish neurons). Neuroscientists have theorized that this architecture may have allowed Einstein to think with the kind of “associative play” of images that he claimed was key to his discoveries. However, the typology of Einstein’s brain can never completely account for his brilliance, in part because we don’t know what came first: was Einstein a genius because his brain looked this way, or did it look this way because he was a genius? It’s hard to know, especially without a lot of other Einstein-quality brains available. Meanwhile, this brain—a victim of 1950s-era preservation techniques and Harvey’s many journeys around the country—is no longer in great shape for study. The Mütter’s forty-six microscope slides of the brain came from a Philadelphia neuropathologist named Lucy Rorke-Adams, who donated them to the museum in 2011. She received them from a colleague in the ’70s, who got them from Harvey himself. An octogenarian herself, Rorke-Adams said she wanted to find a safe place for the slides before she passed on. She chose well, and the slides are now one of the museum’s most prized possessions. Easy to miss, but worth poring over, is the collection of 2,000 objects removed from people’s throats, housed in attractive wooden pull out display drawers. These are from the Chevalier Jackson Foreign Body Collection, amassed by Chevalier Jackson, who is considered to be the greatest laryngologist of all time. Also of particular interest are the conjoined twin skeletons, delicately displayed in various jaunty positions; the plaster death cast of celebrated “Siamese Twins” Chang and Eng Bunker, who died within hours of each other; the “Soap Lady,” an exhumed corpse from the 1800s unusual for the waxy substance that formed around it during decomposition; and enough horrifyingly-detailed wax models and preserved human fetuses to last more than a lifetime.

Still, it has managed to become the most photographed and most-visited slot canyon in all of the American Southwest due to its beauty and a peculiar phenomenon of natural light beams. Formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion, Antelope Canyon’s magnificent smooth and flowing shaped sandstone has made it one of the most famous slot canyons in the world. Located within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation in Arizona, Antelope Canyon is actually two separate canyons, the upper canyon and lower canyon. The upper canyon, which the Navajo call Tsé bighánílíní (“the place where water runs through rocks”), is a narrow passage through 120-foot-high canyon walls. The lower canyon is known as Hazdistazí (“spiral rock arches”) and is a shallower V-shaped canyon that is a more difficult trek for visitors.   Both upper and lower canyons are only accessible by guided tour which are pretty expensive. Also, pets are not allowed anywhere in the park, including service animals! Tripods are not allowed, unless on a photography tour, which comes with a surcharge.

16,Fly Geyser,"Gerlach, Nevada",A collision of human error and natural geothermal pressure created this rainbow-colored geologic wonder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fly-ranch-geyser,"This alien-looking geyser on the edge of Black Rock Desert is actually human-made. But it wasn’t put there on purpose. The Fly Ranch property is located in Nevada’s Hualapai Geothermal Flats, an area known for its unique geothermal pools. There are three geysers on the property. The first, known as The Wizard, was created more than 100 years ago, during an effort to make the desert usable for farming. While drilling a well, workers hit geothermal water that was about 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Because the water was not suitable for agricultural use, this geyser was left alone. A 10-12 foot calcium carbonate cone formed as a result of the water’s mineral content. In 1964, a geothermic energy company drilled a test well at the same site. They struck the same water, which was hot, but not hot enough for their purposes. The well was supposedly re-sealed, but apparently, the cap did not hold. A new, larger geyser emerged a few hundred feet north of the original. Robbed of its water pressure, the older cone remains active, but at a substantially reduced rate. This second geyser, now known as Fly Geyser, has grown as minerals from the water have been deposited on the desert surface. It has multiple cone-shaped openings that measure up to six feet tall, and sits on a tall mound. The third geyser, known as Will’s Geyser, discovered in 2006, is believed to be of natural origin. This volcanic shaped formation grows at a rate of six inches per year. Because there are multiple geyser spouts, this geyser has not created a cone as large as the first, but instead an ever-growing alien-looking mound that shoots water up to five feet in the air. The geyser is covered with mineral deposits and thermophilic algae, which flourishes in moist, hot environments. The combination has led to multiple hues of green and red that add to its out-of-this-world appearance. In June 2016, the non-profit Burning Man Project purchased the Fly Ranch property for $6.5 million. Their mission is to protect and restore the habitats found within the 3,800-acre property, which include wetlands, natural springs, sagebrush-grasslands, and playa. In May 2018, they opened the ranch to the public for the first time in two decades.  The geyser can be seen from State Route 34 north of the town Gerlach. Drop-in visits are not permitted, but Friends of Black Rock-High Rock hosts weekly nature walks on the property from April to October. These nature walks are device-free, and visitors are not permitted to take photos during the walk. At the end of the walk, you will have time to get your camera and snap some photos.",geysers travelnevada martian landscapes disaster areas geological oddities ecosystems water geology

Built in the 1960s and designed by a local teenager, the slides are actually a triumph of neighborhood activism. In 1963, the land that the Corwin Community Garden and Seward Mini-Park sits on was a vacant lot slated for development. Local residents and growing families from nearby streets organized and protested the disappearance of open space, and fought development for a decade, including staging a desperate bulldozer-defying sit-in in 1966. In the end, the locals triumphed and turned the lot into a park, which opened in 1973. Their efforts also contributed to changing city legislation now requiring a minimum amount of open space in new development projects. The slides are surrounded by a small park and California native plant garden.  Open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 am to 5 pm (Closed Mondays).

18,Thor's Well,"Yachats, Oregon",On the Oregon coast there is a natural hole that seems to be draining the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thor-s-well,"Sitting on the edge of the Oregon coast near Cape Perpetua, a gaping, seemingly bottomless sinkhole swallows the unbroken stream of seawater around it. Thor’s Well, as the natural wonder is known, is not actually bottomless; it is, however, very dangerous. Also known as the drainpipe of the Pacific, the well is actually a hole in the rock that only appears to drain water from the ocean. According to some researchers, the Well probably started out as a sea cave dug out by the waves, before the roof eventually collapsed and created openings at the bottom and top through which the ocean sprays. The huge hole is likely only around 20 feet (six meters) deep, but it still manages to produce amazing sights. (Not for the faint of heart, however!) The site is most spectacular at high tide, or during storms when water washes violently over the rocks and funnels into the hole. During these sudden torrents, unsuspecting visitors to the site run the risk of being swept right into the maelstrom. Regardless of the risks, photographers and nature lovers continue to flock to the stunning fountain to see the aggressive waters that live up to their godly namesake’s stormy personality. The best time to visit Thor’s Well is one hour before the high tide to see it without water and then observe how the formation fills up.

19,New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum,"New Orleans, Louisiana",A snapshot of the city's fascinating voodoo culture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-orleans-historic-voodoo-museum,"New Orleans has a reputation for being mysterious and unusual, and in a city of wide and eclectic tastes, the New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum fits right in. The small museum has been inviting its visitors to experience mysticism and the occult for almost half a century. It was founded in 1972 by Charles Massicot Gandolfo, a local artist with a passion for all things voodoo—his nickname would become “Voodoo Charlie.” The museum focuses on what is commonly known as New Orleans Voodoo, or Louisiana Voodoo. New Orleans voodoo is an amalgamation of African and European influences that blended within the cultural melting pot of New Orleans. Originally brought to the city in the early 1700s through the African slave trade, Louisiana Voodoo blends together influences from multiple cultures. It is one of many incarnations of religions rooted in West African Vodun, with elements of Louisiana’s.Catholic and Francophone culture. The tenets of Louisiana Voodoo include recognition of one God, who does not interfere in daily life, and spiritual forces that do. These spirits can be kind or mischievous, and followers can connect with them through dance, music, and singing. Snakes are a common motif in Louisiana Voodoo, as they represent Legba, a spiritual conduit between heaven and earth. A plethora of interesting objects and artifacts fill the museum, including antique voodoo dolls, taxidermy, talismans, and even the kneeling bench that once belonged to the famed Voodoo priestess Maria Laveau. (Visitors can also depart here for a tour of the St. Louis Cemetery, where Ms. Laveau is entombed.) As a voodoo priestess, her magical powers were legendary. However, there may be another explanation of her fame: She was rumored to run one of the most popular brothels in New Orleans. Beyond its collection, the museum also offers items for sale, such as chicken feet, snake skins, potions, books, and candles. Guests who want the full voodoo experience can even have their fortune told by on-staff practitioners.  The museum is open every day from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. It's open on most holidays. The cost is $8.00 for general admission, $6.00 for seniors, military, and students.",voodoo occult museums and collections museums
20,The Witch's Castle,"Portland, Oregon",These old stone ruins in the Oregon wilderness were once bathrooms and are steeped in legends of murder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-witches-castle-portland-oregon,"From tales of murder to bathrooms to the site of high school keggers, the ruins that are now known as The Witch’s Castle have lived a number of lives, and none of them were very pleasant. In the mid-1800s, well before the structure was built, a man named Danford Balch bought a large portion of land around the area while Portland was still in the process of being developed. It was a big enough area that he had to hire help to clear the area, so he hired a man named Mortimer Stump, who lived in the cabin on the property with Balch’s family of 10. Over time, Stump and Balch’s daughter Anna fell in love, and eventually Stump asked Balch for his Anna’s hand in marriage. Balch refused, resulting in Stump and Anna threatening to elope. Balch became infuriated and told Stump that he would murder him if they did. The young couple didn’t heed the warning, and decided to elope in November of 1858. When Balch learned of the elopement, he became deeply depressed, which led to days of no sleep and of heavy drinking. When the young couple returned to Portland, Balch quickly remedied the situation as he saw fit: He shot Stump in the face with a double-barreled shotgun  while all were aboard the Stark Street Ferry. Balch was quickly arrested, but was able to escape from the wooden jail he was held in. This led to his execution in mid-October of 1859, which became the first legal execution in Oregon. After Balch’s death, the property was passed around through different hands down the next century, eventually bequeathed to the city of Portland. In the 1930s, the stone structure that is seen today was built near the site of the Balch homestead. It was maintained by Portland Parks and Recreation, and was used as a park ranger station and restrooms for hikers. In 1962, the structure was heavily damaged in a storm and was abandoned. Moss soon covered the stone walls, the roof caved in, and some people graffitied its walls. It was mostly forgotten until the 1980s, when local high school students found it was a fun place to hold parties. The students named it “the Witch’s Castle” (despite no connection to witches) and made a tradition of holding gatherings on Friday nights, something that still happens today.  The Witch’s House is a slightly difficult, half-mile hike from the Upper Macleay Parking lot near the Portland Audubon Society, or a slightly longer three-quarter mile jaunt starting from the Lower Macleay Parking lot at at NW 30th and Upshur. One can take the Aspen trail to get there. A great way of accessing the trailhead is to walk up on Thurman Street.",ao loves halloween 2022 bathrooms witches crime crime and punishment ruins
21,Mount Moriah Cemetery,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",An abandoned cemetery lies in ruins as the surrounding forest swallows it whole.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-moriah-cemetery,"In Southwest Philadelphia, the abandoned Mount Moriah Cemetery is steadily being reclaimed by the forest it was once built on. Opening in 1855, it had an ornate Romanesque entrance and gothic mausoleums that rivaled the great cemeteries of Greenwood in Brooklyn, and the famous Pere LaChaise in Paris. Eventually expanding to nearly 400 acres, it was Pennsylvania’s largest burial site.  What’s perhaps most unusual about the cemetery is that no one actually owns it. When the last member of the original governing Mount Moriah Cemetery Association passed away a decade ago, the already neglected cemetery was left abandoned.  Today it is largely forgotten. The grand brick entrance lies in ruins, the headstones and monuments have toppled over, and the forest is gradually covering the grounds. Mausoleums that hold some of Philadelphia’s wealthiest Victorian patriarchs are starting to resemble a sort of rambling gothic fairytale. Trying to combat Mother Nature, the local non-profit Friends Of Mount Moriah are devoting their time to clearing weeds and creating pathways through this overgrown and forgotten cemetery. But with so much land to contend with and little or no funding, the task is Herculean—walking through Mount Moriah today, you could easily think you were strolling through the ruins of an ancient Greek city rather than the final resting place of tens of thousands Pennsylvanian families.  Update as of May 2017: Although there is a good bit still overgrown, it is being cleaned up as of the spring of 2017. Update as of October 2019: The nonprofit group, Friends of Mount Moriah Cemetery has been working for years to restore the cemetery. Around 50% of the cemetery has been reopened for the public to safely visit. Update as of May 2022: Around 60-70% of the cemetery seems restored for visitation.",abandoned cemeteries memento mori graveyards burial places cemeteries abandoned

It is the peculiar mix of the burlesque, kitsch, and retro-modern that has marked the visual identity of an age. Many of the most recognizable neon displays from the golden age of Las Vegas casinos have been produced by Young Electric Sign Company (YESCO). This Salt Lake City-based company has maintained a storage yard in Las Vegas for decades. This three-acre plot has, over the years, become a veritable graveyard of disused neon signs. It is the final resting place of some notable pieces of Vegas history, like the original Aladdin’s lamp from the first version of Aladdin Casino, Binion’s Horseshoe, Silver Slipper, and the Golden Nugget. There are over 150 decommissioned, non-restored neon signs at this location. In 2005, the La Concha Hotel, a Paul Revere Williams design, was moved up the street to serve as the museum’s visitor center.  Tours are available daily and can be reserved online via the Neon Museum. Local discounts are available.

Founded in 1904 by seven leading polar explorers of the era, the Explorers Club fosters the scientific exploration of land, sea, air and space. The 1910 Jacobean revival mansion was originally built for Stephen Clark, grandson of the co-founder of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. The Explorers Club purchased the building from the Clark family in 1960 after Stephen’s death. It became the international headquarters in 1965. Prior to this, they had several locations in New York City. It is known as the Lowell Thomas building, named after the famed writer, broadcaster and Explorers Club member best known for making Lawrence of Arabia famous. A century’s worth of exploration treasures fill the floors. The ground floor member lounge houses a few of their polar artifacts. On your way up to the second floor, you won’t be able to miss the giant globe used by Thor Heyerdahl to plan his famous Kon-Tiki expedition. Percy, the polar bear, greets you on the second floor. As you head into the library, you will see The Rescue of Greeley, painted within hours of their rescue in 1884. The library holds a tiny fraction of the 13,000 books that make up the research and archives collection. All lectures and events are held in the Clark room. The walls proudly display a few of the retired expedition flags from historic explorations. A sled from the 1909 North Pole expedition and an extremely rare set of double elephant tusks from the Congo can also be found here. The uppermost floor is home to the research archives, holding the club’s impressive collection of 13,000 books, 1,000 museum objects, 5,000 maps and 500 films. The Gallery on the top floor is the room everyone wants to see. In the early days of the Explorers Club when travel was difficult and field photography was relatively new, hunting and taxidermy were thought to be the best way to preserve animals for education and research. Here you will see taxidermied animals from many decades past. Objects from the far corners of the world, including a narwhal tusk, wooly mammoth tusk (ask about the famous 1951 Explorers Club dinner), and the famous yeti scalp.  Visitors are welcome during opening hours. Group tours can be scheduled by contacting reservations. Regular talks with exploration greats are held in the Clark Room from September - June.",yeti dead explorers hunting and taxidermy wonder cabinets clubs repositories of knowledge exploration taxidermy natural history
24,'Akhob',"Las Vegas, Nevada","James Turrell's total color immersion art installation, hidden on the top floor of a luxury handbag shop.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/akhob,"Imagine the sheer serendipity of finding a world-renowned artist’s work secreted away on the top floor of a French luxury goods store, in the midst of a tacky oasis, and you’ll have only begun to appreciate the wonder of James Turrell’s “Akhob.” Las Vegas is known for aspirations of grandeur and attempting to fulfill them by any means necessary. Fueling this mentality is a plethora of luxury stores, ready to furnish high rollers and poseurs with all the accouterments necessary to play. But a visit to the Louis Vuitton outpost lets visitors in-the-know walk away with a little added value to their shopping experience: artistic fulfillment. In 2013, Louis Vuitton commissioned a permanent James Turrell installation to occupy a hidden space on the fourth floor of its City Center store. Called “Akhob,” a word from Egypt’s Amarna period supposedly meaning “pure water,” the piece consists of circular openings leading into two huge chambers filled with slowly changing, rotating light. Turrell calls these sort of iconic installations, for which he’s famous, “ganzfelds” or “light fields.” The effect created is one of giving your eyes a gentle, soothing bath in the most brilliant colors imaginable. Vibrant hues shift imperceptibly from one to another, bleeding in and out of each other on a cycle that lasts 24 minutes. At times, the precise combination of colors makes it nearly impossible to find the door through which one had just entered. With all Turrell’s artistic obfuscation, finding Akhob itself is remarkably easy; though admission is free for all, one must simply call ahead to make an appointment for admittance. Once inside the City Center Louis Vuitton store, politely inform any of the employees that you’ve come to see Akhob. From there you’ll be whisked away to their magical secret floor, separate from the store and completely private for a silent immersion experience. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Akhob.  Viewing of the installation is free and open to the public, but limited to four people at a time (private parties can have up to six), so reservations must be scheduled in advance. To make a reservation, call (702) 730-3150. NOTE: The reservations are always booked for six to eight weeks (yes, a healthy two months) solid, so call well in advance. They are open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from 12 pm-5 pm. You will be required to sign a three-page release form and to remove your shoes when entering the installation.",installations art
25,Mapparium,"Boston, Massachusetts","An enormous, inside-out glass globe built in 1935.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mapparium,"In the early 1930s, Boston architect Chester Lindsay Churchill was commissioned to design the new Christian Science Publishing Society headquarters to compete with the other grand newspaper headquarters of the day. The New York Daily News building had its famous gigantic spinning globe. Naturally, the Christian Science Monitor had to do one better. Enter the Mapparium, a three-story-tall, inside-out stained-glass globe that is bisected in the middle by a glass walkway. Once illuminated with hundreds of lamps, today it glows with the light of LEDs. The Mapparium gives you a rare chance to see the world in a way that doesn’t distort the surface of the Earth. Even when looking at an accurate globe, the relative sizes of the continents are distorted by perspective, as the spherical shape causes different regions to appear at different distances from the eye. But with a view from the very center of a globe, looking out, the eye is the same distance from every point on the map. It is fascinating to view the Earth this way for the first time. Africa is huge. North America, Europe, and Asia are all jammed up against the North Pole. You have to look nearly straight up to see them. Sizes and locations of continents and countries you’ve always taken for granted are suddenly unfamiliar. While the relative size and position of the continents are correct, the map’s political boundaries are long out of date. The Mapparium hasn’t changed since 1935. It’s still possible to find Siam and French Indochina, but not Israel or Indonesia. The USSR looms large. Africa remains a large block of European colonies. The most curious part of all about the Mapparium is its acoustics. When you stand at the center of the perfect sphere, you can hear your voice in full 360-degree surround sound. The curved glass walls do not absorb the sound waves, but reflect them back. That’s also why those at one end of the bridge can hear the whisper of those at the opposite end—loud and clear. This effect is called a “whispering gallery.”  The Mapparium is located in the Mary Baker Eddy Library, a Blue Star Museum. It's open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (the last 20-minute Mapparium tour starts at 4:40 p.m.) General admission is $6.00.

26,House of Eternal Return,"Santa Fe, New Mexico","An immersive environment that is part haunted house, part choose-your-own-adventure, and part jungle gym.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-eternal-return,"When George R. R. Martin buys a vacant bowling alley in an industrial neighborhood in Santa Fe and leases it out to a 135-member group of artists known for creating elaborate interactive art installations, you can assume that the result will be pretty spectacular. Such is the case with the House of Eternal Return. The first permanent installation created by the Meow Wolf art collective, House of Eternal Return, consists of 20,000 square feet of fully explorable space centered around a full-size reproduction of a two-story Victorian house that harbors a secret. According to the backstory provided to visitors, the house was once inhabited by the Selig family, but then “something happened” that led to the family’s disappearance and apparently warped the nature of time and space. Visitors are turned loose to piece together the non-linear narrative on their own, rifling through the clothes, furnishings, books, and personal papers of the family members and stumbling through cosmic portals hidden throughout the house. House of Eternal Return has a total of 70 distinct interconnected spaces including (but not limited to) enchanted forest tree houses, a tiny Old West ranch powered by hamsters, luminescent caves, space-age corridors, mastodon skeleton xylophones, laser harps, and the study where Grandpa Selig labored to unravel a mind-boggling conspiracy of interdimensional proportions. The space also includes a music venue called Fancy Town and Chimera, a non-profit center that offers classes to children. Summer camps, after school programs, and internships are all offered on-site.  Open daily (except Tuesdays) with late-night admission Friday and Saturday. Be sure to give yourself at least a couple of hours to explore the space at a relaxed pace! If you arrive an hour before close, tickets are discounted, but it's better seen at a slower pace. Ticketing online is highly recommended. A limited number of people are admitted at a time, so the facility does not become too crowded. That means you can wait in line for hours, especially in the summer heat, and may not be able to get in at all or without sufficient time to explore the installation. Making an online reservation allows you to pick an available time of your choice, and the wait when you arrive is far shorter than general admission. There are a gift store and a small cafe on site. Meow Wolf also has immersive experiences in Las Vegas and Colorado.",installations mystery art

Located on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 83rd Street, the Candy Shop is the oldest family-owned luncheonette in the city. American cities were once graced with luncheonettes, as common as Starbucks coffee shops are today. Luncheonettes were generally small, informal restaurants serving light lunches at affordable prices. Walking into the Lexington Candy Shop, which opened its doors in 1925, is to step into a bygone era, an Edward Hopper painting come to life. Last renovated in 1948, the luncheonette still uses its original coffee urns and makes milkshakes and traditional New York egg creams with a 1940 Hamilton Beach mixer. Photos of celebrities and other memorabilia adorn the walls, including a picture of Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway, who filmed a scene for the spy movie Three Days of the Condor here. Today, the Candy Shop is run by John Philis, the grandson of the original owner. It’s a true neighborhood spot, both friendly and charming, serving much the same menu as it did when FDR was president: tuna melts, egg creams, malted milkshakes, and sodas using real syrup. While much of New York constantly changes—torn down and rarely preserved—the Lexington Candy Shop remains one of the city’s most tasty treasures.",candy preservation shops food history

The traumatic disaster stayed in the national consciousness as the deadliest natural catastrophe in recent memory. Katrina’s wrath left behind a glut of dystopian landscapes, and it didn’t spare the Six Flags amusement park, whose contents sank and rose along with the tide until all that was left was something that resembled a post-Atlantis wonderland. Murky water rose to six feet high throughout the park, where it turned concession stands upside down and roller coasters into massive and hopeless sea snakes. The swampy-tinged tide, relentless rainwater and corrosive saltwater from the coast remained stagnant in the area for several weeks and destroyed 80% of the park equipment and rides. A notable exception was the Batman roller coaster, which escaped relatively unscathed due to its location on an elevated platform. Judged too expensive to restore and thus slated for demolition by the Six Flags corporation, the defunct park fell into disrepair – a pastel-colored ghost town haunted by silence and disenchantment. Of course, muddy clowns, smashed mermaids, and Mardi Gras figures stuck in an apocalyptic freeze-frame are hard to resist for adventurous disaster tourists, so the ruins of this amusement park have attracted legions of urban explorers, who follow the access road to the west of the park and trespass to experience a captivating walk through the devastated funland. If you decide to join them, please be warned that entry to the abandoned park is illegal – enter at your own risk.  This site can be dangerous and can be deemed trespassing if caught inside.

Today, the Paint Mines Interpretive Park remains a geological wonder hidden on the eastern plains in El Paso County. No doubt this was also a place where Native Americans collected clay to be used as war paint on their bodies, and on their horses. The weird stone shapes formed by water, wind, and erosion seem to shift size, position, and “expression” with the shifting light. The spires come in shades from creamy white to orange, purple, gray, rust, and chocolate brown. The area is a protected site since the beautiful formations are fragile, as is the natural animal ecosystem that lives there. To preserve this delicate natural balance, dogs and other domesticated animals are not permitted on the land, nor are motorized vehicles, and no camping is allowed. Nothing in the park is to be disturbed, removed, or defaced. The park also asks visitors to stay off the sandstone formations, and stick strictly to the trail, which winds in and around the park in a three-mile loop.

30,Havasupai Falls,"Supai, Arizona","This secluded aqua waterfall in the Grand Canyon is the perfect swimming hole, and the Havasupai tribe's fiercely protected natural wonder.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/havasupai-falls,"The Grand Canyon draws in over five million tourists each year and is hailed as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. But hidden deep within a side canyon, on the reservation of the local Havasupai tribe, completely surrounded by Grand Canyon National Park and so not really in a National Park, lies something lesser-known to tourists yet unparalleled in beauty: Havasupai Falls. The Havasupai people, which literally translates to “people of the blue-green water,” are native to a region of northern Arizona that’s home to Havasupai Falls, a group of aquamarine waterfalls tucked within the Havasu Canyon. The most famous is Havasu Falls, a stunning cascade that almost looks like it flows with liquid turquoise. Yet despite the inescapable crowds of the Grand Canyon, these beautiful falls are relatively secluded, a long-guarded secret of the Havasupai tribe and a small handful of outsiders. This secrecy is largely a result of the tribe’s understandable reluctance to fully open the gates of their homeland to tourists. Of the tribal nations affiliated with the Grand Canyon area, the Havasupai are the only ones who continue to live deep within the canyon. The Havasupai consider themselves the keepers and guardians of the Grand Canyon. They’ve set up a system of camping permits that only lets a small portion of applicants into the village of Supai, where the falls are located. Even if you’re lucky enough to get the permit, you have to be able to shell out for the helicopter ride, horse ride, or mule ride to assist you in getting there. Otherwise, you’ll have to hike 10 miles there and 10 miles back. It’s a hot, dry, strenuous although beautiful hike, passing red rocks, cacti, and ancient pictograms along the way. Once there, the views from the 100-foot Havasu Falls are priceless. It’s also a daredevil’s dream; visitors have the opportunity to attempt high cliff jumps and swim to a rocky shelter behind the falls, both of which are extremely risky. And as if one aquamarine waterfall wasn’t enough, there are four more in the area. Near Havasu Falls lie Mooney, Navajo, Supai, and Beaver Falls, each beautiful and awe-inspiring in its own way. The reason for the picturesque turquoise color is the high levels of calcium carbonate in the spring-fed waters of Havasu Creek, the source of the five waterfalls. These high levels also create 70-degree travertine pools at the base of some of the falls, making them the perfect swimming holes.  You can either hike or take a mule, horse, or helicopter ride down into the canyon. (The helicopter launch pad is next to the last working Pony Express stop in America.) To visit the falls you must first obtain a permit and reservation to stay at the Havasupai Campground overnight, as day trips to the falls are not permitted. Reservations can be made at the official Havasupai Tribe website.",blue waterfalls indigenous native americans water

Waterfalls routinely fall from the lip of the overhang, flowing down the 50-foot drop and splashing into the cool water below, making this a beautiful and refreshing location for sunbaked summer adventurers and swimmers. In case of the high levels of certain bacteria, the pool is closed for swimming. Besides being a popular tourist attraction, this place is a rich ecosystem. The ceiling of the pool and cliffs surrounding the grotto are home to moss, cliff swallows, and maidenhair fern.  23 miles west of Austin, on Highway 71. Surrounded by the Hamilton Nature Preserve.

33,Yayoi Kusama Firefly Infinity Mirror Room,"Phoenix, Arizona","The installation’s official name, “You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies,” says it all.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yayoi-kusama-firefly-infinity-mirror-room,"The 89-year-old Japanese avant-garde artist Yayoi Kusama is finally getting her due as one of the greatest living artists in the world. Having moved to New York just in time for the exploding avant-garde art movement of the 1960s, Kusama was known for her wild “happenings.” She staged large events featuring nude people covered in polka dots, opened a nude painting studio and social club, and once wrote a letter to Richard Nixon offering to have vigorous sex with him if he stopped the Vietnam War. Yet despite being a darling of New York’s counterculture art scene, Kusama was largely forgotten after moving back to Japan in 1973 for health issues, where she voluntarily took up residence in a hospital for the mentally ill. Kusama never stopped making art, but it wasn’t until the early 1990s that her work began to gain international recognition once again. It has been on a steady upward climb since. Working from the hospital, she sold a piece of artwork in 2008 for $5.1 million, setting a record for the highest price paid to a living female artist. Fans can now once again experience Kusama’s wild and wonderful work in person, at an installation appropriately entitled “You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies.” Installed permanently at the Phoenix Art Museum, the piece uses a 25-foot square space with mirror-lined walls, flooring of polished black granite, a black plexiglass ceiling, and 250 dangling LED lights programmed with alternating color. The effect is ethereal and expansive. Like much of Kusama’s work, your sense of self, space, and time are overwhelmed and nearly obliterated by visual force.  The exhibit is located in the Contemporary Art Wing of the Phoenix Art Museum, just off of North Central Avenue in downtown Phoenix.",outsider art sculptures art

35,Alcatraz Island,"San Francisco, California","In all of the 29 years it was in operation, no prisoners ever escaped successfully... or so they claim.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alcatraz-island,"Alcatraz, also referred to as “The Rock,” is rich in American history, more so than most people realize. It is the home of the oldest operating lighthouse on the west coast, a Civil War fortress that served as the San Francisco Arsenal, the infamous federal prison, the beginning of the American Indian Red Power movement, and also a bird sanctuary. In 1775 Spaniard Juan Manuel de Ayala named the island “La Isla de los Alcatraces” which translates into “The Island of the Pelicans.” Since then, the earliest recorded owner of the island is Julian Workman, who was assigned by Mexican governor Pio Pico to build a lighthouse on it in June 1846. In 1850 President Millard Fillmore claimed Alcatraz Island for military use only after America gained California in the Mexican-American War. As the American Civil War broke out in the early 1860s, Alcatraz was loaded up with cannons and served as storage and protection of firearms for the San Francisco Arsenal. During the war it was also used to imprison Confederate sympathizers. In 1868, after the building of a brick jailhouse, it was officially designated a long-term facility for military prisoners. The main cellblock was constructed between 1909 and 1912, and an excavated pit was created as a dry moat to increase defensive efforts. The fortress was deactivated as a military prison in 1933 and opened as a federal prison in August of 1934. Through 1963, the prison held many notable criminals like Al Capone, Bumpy Johnson, George “Machine Gun” Kelly, and Robert Franklin Stroud (the Birdman of Alcatraz). However, in all of the 29 years it was in operation, no prisoners ever successfully escaped, or at least none that they have found alive. Fourteen escape attempts were made by 36 different Alcatraz inmates over the years and though almost all were captured or killed in the process, in two escapes in 1937 and June 1962, the inmates disappeared without a trace. The prison assumes they all drowned (quite likely correct in the 1937 case), but over the years there have been sightings of the escapees, leading to much speculation about their possible successful escape. The 1962 escape from Alcatraz inspired a book and movie that brought the prison to national fame. The penitentiary was closed in 1963 due to the high costs of operation in comparison with other prisons as well as the severe eroding of the building due to the salt water. In 1976, Alcatraz Island became part of the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1986 it became a National Historic Landmark.",al capone crime museums lighthouses prisons crime crime and punishment islands

At its peak, the land movement was measured at an astounding 11 inches a day. The land that collapsed connected Pacific Ave to Paseo Del Mar was outside the perimeter of Point Fermin Park, and took several of the wood frame homes as well as the street, Red Car rail tracks, and sidewalks with it. Homes unaffected were relocated to other parts of town, and the wrecked remnants were demolished. Today, the area is called “Sunken City” by locals. The area has long been a posted “No Trespassing” spot, frequented by stoners, tagging crews, and people wanting to say they’ve been there. Trespassers gain $450 citations during sweeps by the LA Police Dept, Park Rangers, and Los Angeles Port Police. Vehicles of scofflaws are towed for $375 + $175 a day for storage day until they’re bailed out. Rescues by the LA Fire Dept are a weekly occurrence due to falls along the unstable terrain by adventurous visitors. The surrounding community is quick to report trespassers as they’re tired of the attempted home and car break-ins, graffiti, loud partying, raging bonfires, and of the assaults and rapes awaiting people inside and out, as they exit the fences surrounding the no trespassing zone. Despite the pervasive interest encouraged by previous visitors to “jump the fence”, be mindful that the entry fee starts at $450 per person for all ages, payable to the LA County Court system.

37,The Witch House of Salem,"Salem, Massachusetts",The only structure left with direct ties to the Salem witchcraft trials of 1692.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/witch-house-salem,"The Salem witchcraft trials took place between February 1692 and May 1693. More than 200 people were accused, 59 were tried, 31 were found guilty, and 20 were executed. Those final unfortunates were hanged, and one man was crushed to death while being tortured. Among the judges who convicted the witches (based on “spectral evidence,” evidence based upon dreams or visions) was Jonathan Corwin. As a local magistrate and civic leader, Corwin was called upon to investigate the claims of diabolical activity when a surge of witchcraft accusations arose in Salem and neighboring communities. He took the place of Judge Nathaniel Saltonstall, who resigned after the execution of Bridget Bishop. Corwin served on the Court of Oyer and Terminer, which ultimately sent nineteen to the gallows. All 19 refused to admit to witchcraft and maintained their innocence. The Witch House, as it is now known, was his home and is the only structure still standing in Salem, Massachusetts with direct ties to the Salem witch trials of 1692. The house was bought by Judge Corwin in 1675, when he was 24 years old, and he lived there for more than forty years. Corwin is buried in the nearby Broad Street Cemetery. The house remained in the Corwin family until the mid-19th century. Today the house is a museum focusing on 17th-century living. It’s one of the last remaining links to a time in American history when people were hanged because they supposedly inflicted pain by the use of “venomous and malignant particles, that were ejected from the eye.”  If you're visiting Salem during Samhain, better known as Halloween or anytime in the month of October, get there early (even during the week).

38,Dry Tortugas,"Key West, Florida","These remote Florida islands have a history of sea turtles and sunken treasures, and one of the world's largest coastal brick fortresses.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dry-tortugas,"Juan Ponce de Leon first stumbled upon this stretch of islands in 1513, back when they were nothing more than clusters of coral inhabited by sea turtles. Upon his discovery, de Leon named the islands “Las Tortugas” (meaning “the turtles”), and is said to have subsisted off 160 of these very animals while on his journey through the high seas. (“Dry” was later added to the islands’ name as an attempt to warn mariners of the lack of freshwater in the area.) After de Leon’s discovery, the Dry Tortugas became a fixture on Spanish ship maps for merchants and explorers going to and from the Gulf Coast. Seventy miles west of the Florida Keys, and in a prime location between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, the Dry Tortugas soon became a popular shipping corridor. Despite the passageway’s popularity, the Dry Tortugas also became the site of hundreds of shipwrecks. The seasonal shallow waters and hazardous weather conditions lent to the corridor’s infamous title as the “ship trap.” To this day, a large collection of sunken treasures still lies beneath the surface waters. Seventeenth-century vessel remains, cannons, and glassware are among some of the maritime relics. Of all the Dry Tortugas treasures, though, Fort Jefferson perhaps remains the crown jewel. Once Florida was acquisitioned from Spain in 1822, the United States began plans to erect a naval station that would help combat piracy in the Caribbean. Eventually, the U.S. Navy agreed on the Dry Tortugas as the site for their fortress, arguing that U.S. shipping in the Gulf Coast would be in jeopardy if a hostile power were to take over the islands. In 1847, after seventeen years of extensive planning, Fort Jefferson began construction on the Garden Key Island. The design plans called for a practically indestructible hexagonal fortress, complete with a massive 420 heavy-gun platform. Two sides of the fort measured 325 feet and four sides measured 477 feet. The structure stood 45-feet above sea level, surrounded entirely by a wall and a 70-foot wide moat. Though construction lasted for roughly thirty years, Fort Jefferson was never fully completed. Despite this, 16 million bricks were laid, making it one of the largest coastal forts ever built. During the Civil War the fort was also used as a prison, mainly for Union deserters. The most famous inmate, however, was Dr. Samuel Mudd, who was convicted of conspiracy in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. After shooting President Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth jumped from the theater box, broke one of his legs, and immediately fled to Dr. Mudd’s farm where he received medical assistance. In 1865, Dr. Mudd was sentenced to life in prison and sent to the remote fortress. Two years later, a yellow fever outbreak occurred at Fort Jefferson. The outbreak took a number of lives, including the lone doctor who had been stationed at the fort. Dr. Mudd agreed to step in as a replacement and, as a result, many lives were saved. Consequently, the soldiers started a petition demanding Dr. Mudd’s release; a petition which President Andrew Johnson granted only four years into Dr. Mudd’s life sentence. The fort was abandoned by the Army in 1874. In later years it served as a coaling station, a quarantine station for the Marine-Hospital Service from 1888-1900, during which the location was also used in the Spanish-American War and, in 1935, it was registered by President Roosevelt as a National Monument. Today it operates as part of the Dry Tortugas National Park. Accessible only by boat or seaplane, the Dry Tortugas are considered to be one of America’s most remote and least visited national parks.  The best way to get there is by sea plane from Key West. When flying, you will be able to look down and see large sea turtles and other sea creatures. When visiting, I recommend adequate footwear because the sand is hot and the fortress is littered with stone and other hazards. It's a pretty free range place; we felt free to walk wherever wasn't under rehabilitation.",sea forts islands water ruins architectural oddities animals architecture

Otto Penzler has had a significant hand in that transformation. He’s probably the most important figure in the history of mystery fiction who’s never written a mystery story. You get into Otto Penzler’s New York office through a door in the Mysterious Bookshop, the world’s oldest and biggest bookstore focusing on mystery, crime fiction, espionage, and thrillers. The door is roped off with a big X made of yellow police tape reading CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS. Down a flight of stairs, his office is a low-ceilinged basement cube with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves on all four sides, stocked with anthologies and first editions as well as a random sampling of mass-market hardcovers and paperbacks. If the office was a store by itself, it would be the second-best mystery bookstore in the world. Penzler is the owner of the Mysterious Bookshop (founded 1979) as well as The Mysterious Press, a publishing imprint he founded in 1975, and mysteriouspress.com, his ebook publisher. He has published most of the greats of mystery and crime fiction: Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, James Ellroy, Ross Thomas, Patricia Highsmith, Ross Macdonald, Ed McBain. Any of the major authors he hasn’t published are probably at least good friends of his. The Mysterious Bookshop itself. Today the store is down in Tribeca, on a block that doesn’t suggest anything important in the literary world. It’s next to a Le Pain Quotidien and a few doors down from a 7-Eleven. (It was first located on 56th Street in Manhattan, in a building Penzler owned because it was cheaper to buy—New York was different back then.) Inside, every square inch of walls leading up to what must be 20-foot ceilings are packed with any book in which someone violently dies. There is an entire section for Sherlock Holmes books, including the many spinoffs written by dozens of authors. There are copies of long-defunct detective magazines like Black Mask. There is an entire section for what Penzler calls bibliomysteries—mystery books involving mysterious books. Murdered librarians, valuable manuscripts, that kind of thing. The bookstore is not twee. There are no props, aside from the caution tape; no pranks, no cute designs or artworks. This is a temple to the noble mystery, a place where people who can name all of Donald E.

This particular coil was once owned by Dr. Fredrick Finch Strong – physician, theosophist and enthusiastic electrotherapeutics experimenter. Finch Strong was fascinated by Tesla’s 1893 description of the effects of alternating currents on his research team and began experimenting with high voltage therapies himself. He went on to write a book in 1908 – High Frequency Currents – about his theories on using electricity to affect patients’ “vibrations.” Finch Strong donated the major components of the coil to the City of Los Angeles. It was rebuilt and given a home at the famous observatory where it has been on display since 1937.

42,Bradbury Building,"Los Angeles, California",The legendary building that needed ghostly approval before being built.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bradbury-building,"Mining mogul Lewis L. Bradbury had a grandiose vision for a 5-story building in the heart of Los Angeles, and he was convinced only one man could build it for him. Reluctant draftsman George Wyman wanted no part of the project, and remained stubborn until conferring with his dead brother via planchette board. Despite being six feet under for just as many years, Mark Wyman’s message was clear- the job would bring success. So George Wyman acquiesced, and the Bradbury Building came into being. Heavily influenced by the utopian sci-fi novel “Looking Backward” by Edward Bellamy, the vast structure is magnificent in its intricacies. The outside isn’t overly inviting, but once inside, you enter a gorgeous center courtyard filled with natural light streaming in from a skylight. Caged elevators, surrounded by ornate wrought iron used abundantly on the many staircases cast shadows around the courtyard. Used as a set for numerous films, notably Blade Runner, the lacework balconies appear in all sorts of popular culture venues, influencing film, TV, comic books, music videos and video game designs. The strongest bond that the Bradbury Building has in popular culture remains with Science Fiction. Not only was its design inspired by a sci-fi novel and its courtyard the ideal setting for films of the genre, Wyman’s grandson was science fiction publisher Forrest J. Ackerman. It is a common misconception that the building was named after Ray Bradbury, Ackerman’s close friend and famed sci-fi author, but the author sharing a name with the founder is merely a coincidence.",retrofuturistic elevators victorian film locations outsider architecture

Built along with the rest of Grand Central Terminal, Track 61 was never properly abandoned, as it was actually constructed to be a powerhouse and storage area for unused New York Central Railroad cars, not a passenger station:  Contrary to popular belief,  Track 61 is not part of the NYC Subway but rather part of the New York Central Railroad, now Metro-North. The station is not much to look at, what with all the untended grime and dirt, but there is still an antique train car permanently parked in the hidden powerhouse. However, the dingy industrial stretch of track has managed to gain a fair amount of fame as the private transport stop for US presidents. The earliest reported use of the track was during the tenure of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who supposedly had his car transported to the station. The car was then lifted right into the Waldorf’s garage. Roosevelt is also rumored to have entered and exited via the station in order to hide his worsening case of polio. Track 61 likely hid the comings and goings of a number of Presidents over the years and was confirmed to be prepped for a quick getaway route for George W. Bush while he took meetings at the Waldorf. Everyone from military generals to celebrities have been said to use Track 61 for any number of clandestine movements, but given the amount of secrecy involved, all are hard to confirm. However, the unmarked brass door at the Waldorf’s street level which leads to the station is proof that someone important is still using the track. Update as of January 2020: The train has been moved to the Danbury Railway Museum in Connecticut.",subways secret presidents underground trains
44,Albion Castle,"San Francisco, California",A 140-year-old castle with underground caves hidden in San Francisco.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albion-castle,"Despite its long history and six-story stone tower, most residents of San Francisco, even those that pass by it daily, have no idea that Albion Castle exists. Built in 1870 by John Hamlin Burnell, a young English immigrant with plans for a brewery to supply the over 800 saloons serving the growing city. Beer was already a popular choice in San Francisco, with several local breweries already competing for business. But Burnell’s new property had a secret advantage: An underground aquifer that provided pure cold water, perfect for brewing - not to mention free. He built himself not only the workspaces for the Albion Porter & Ale Brewery, but also a castle home. Although relatively petite and built into a hillside, it features a distinctive tower built from stones pulled from cargo ship’s ballast, modeled after Norman fortifications Burnell loved back home. Under the castle, Burnell dug out two stone cisterns, each capturing 8,000 to 10,000 gallons of spring water per day. The 200-foot pools are accessed by a cave entrance, and still provide fresh clean water today. Burnell built his unusual brewery on land on the outskirts of the city then managed by the Hunter brothers. Now known as Hunter’s Point, it was the site of a huge Naval shipbuilding yard for decades, now a rough-edged neighborhood. The property has changed hands many times, and had several incarnations over the years. After the 18th amendment (Prohibition) forced the brewery to close down in 1919, the property was reborn as the Albion Water Company, providing bottled drinking water from the underground cisterns from 1928 to 1947. In 1938, the castle was bought by the sculptor Adrian Voisin who remodeled the living area, adding much of the woodwork and medieval-inspired interior that is there today. He lived and worked there for some twenty years. In 1961 the castle was nearly the victim of a highway construction scheme that planned to bulldoze the building, but it was saved based on the argument that the fresh water source under the building “could be the only non-contaminated source of fresh water in the event of a nuclear attack.” (According to the San Francisco Chronicle at the time) Over the years, the nearby Naval shipyards complained about the inconvenient proximity of a fresh water source so close to their highly hazardous undertakings. In 1998 the property was sold to another artist, this time sculptor Eric Higgs, also known as one of the founders of CitySearch. Until 2005 the castle was used as a residence, art studio, and occasional party location, then it was sold at auction for $2.1 million dollars. The purchasers, local brewers and castle fanciers from Napa county, intended to revitalize the space and re-launch the historic Albion Brewery. Although some renovations to the property and interior were made, the brewery never materialized. In 2012, the castle was purchased by former San Francisco Police lieutenant and real estate investor Bill Gilbert. The structure is currently being rented for small select events, however, plans are underway to bring back the water bottling business to utilize the natural, fresh spring water from the cisterns initiated by the founder.

It was here that he decided to build a house on the sandstone formation called Deer Shelter Rock. Jordan built the house as a weekend retreat and never intended it to be a tourist attraction. However, people kept coming to see the architectural wonder they had heard about. Jordan eventually started asking for 50-cent donations. That was only the beginning. The 14-room house is the original structure of what is now a complex of many buildings, exhibits, and garden displays. It can take many hours to walk through the House on the Rock, and it’s nearly impossible to see it all in one day. Among the collections of collections within is the world’s largest carousel, boasting 269 carousel animals, 182 lanterns, more than 20,000 lights, and hundreds of mannequin angels hanging from the ceiling all around it. Jordan was a collector all his life and enjoyed visiting museums; however, he did not want The House on the Rock to be a museum. He intended it to be much more. Though parts of the collections could have easily found their way into museums, The House on the Rock is more of a trip through the wild and fantastic imagination of Alex Jordan than a visit to a dusty museum. In December of 1988, Alex sold The House on the Rock to longtime associate Art Donaldson, a collector and a businessman who shared his broad interests. Jordan remained at The House on the Rock as Artistic Director until his death on November 6, 1989. Art Donaldson continued to own and operate The House on the Rock until his death in 2018, and the property has remained in the family.

Opened in August 2015, the carousel is the creation of the Battery Conservancy and George Tsypin, a renowned opera and theater designer who is the man behind the staging of LaScala operas, the Sochi Olympics, and the Spider-man Broadway musical. Constructed as a public-private project, it took 10 years and several million dollars to bring the SeaGlass Carousel to life. The SeaGlass Carousel features 30 fiberglass fish spotlighting 12 different species, while the mechanics are unique in that there’s no traditional center pole. By putting individual motors for each fish below the floor, the riders have unobstructed views while the fish both spin independently and swirl around each other as though swimming through the ocean. Rides of the SeaGlass Carousel will also experience a changing LED light display that makes one feel as though they are truly underwater. To add to the overall experience, each fiberglass fish contains its own speakers that play aquatic sounds and music specifically composed for the ride. Each of the fish in the carousel is modeled after an actual species ranging from tall angelfish to the much smaller clown triggerfish. No matter which you choose, it will resemble one underwater lifeform or another that can actually be found out in the ocean  The SeaGlass Carousel is located in Manhattan's Battery Park and is easily accessible by several New York City subway lines, including the 1, R, and W.

The 1903 Beaux-Arts building, home to the real-life Hook & Ladder Company 8, was used for the exterior scenes of the fictional firehouse where Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston set up their ghostbusting operations. Although the Ghostbusters logo sign might not hang from the front of the building like in the movie, it’s still plainly recognizable today as the Ghostbusters firehouse. Besides Ghostbusters, the building’s memorable facade has also been featured in other movies and TV shows. It appeared in the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot and it was used for the external shots of the firehouse where Kramer worked in an episode of Seinfeld. The building was gutted and underwent a major renovation from 2016 to 2018 to update the living quarters, locker rooms, kitchen, and roof. The floor of the century-old building was actually in danger of collapsing from the weight of the fire vehicles stored inside. Following the restoration, the building looks relatively the same, although the red garage door is now noticeably different, with multiple panes of glass. If the firefighters of Hook & Ladder 8, who were among the very first responders to the World Trade Center on September 11, are available to give you a tour of the inside, you can take a look at the collection of melted clocks and phones they’ve accumulated from the various fires they’ve put out.

48,Lake Hillier,Australia,An Australian lake whose pink hue defies scientific explanation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-hillier,"From a distance, Lake Hillier of Australia’s Recherche Archipelago looks like a swath of solid bubble-gum pink. Draw closer, and the color takes on a more watery, translucent quality, but remains unmistakably pink. Whereas the causes behind the unusual coloring of other pink lakes, such as the nearby Pink Lake and Senegal’s Lake Retba, have been definitively confirmed, the reason for Lake Hillier’s color remains a mystery. Theories abound, of course. Some speculate that Lake Hillier’s color, like that of the other lakes, is the result of high salinity combined with the presence of a salt-loving algae species known as Dunaliella salina and pink bacteria known as halobacteria. Unlike other pink lakes, however, which regularly change colors in accordance with temperature fluctuations, Lake Hillier maintains its pink shade year-round. The water even retains its rosy hue when bottled. Whatever the cause, the water does not appear to pose any danger to humans. Swimming in it is not possible anyway, since the island is used only for research purposes and tourists can admire it only from above on helicopter rides.  Helicopter flights operate daily during the October–April period. The rest of the year, you can book a private tour.",wonders of salt natural wonders water nature
49,Glowworm Tunnel,"Helensburgh, Australia",An abandoned railroad tunnel is now filled with bioluminescent bugs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glow-worm-tunnel-helensburgh,"Drowned railroad tracks lead to an abandoned passageway nearly lost within a cascade of leafy greenery. Once inside, an enchanting blue glow illuminates the dark, dank tunnel. Officially called the Metropolitan Tunnel, this underground passage was built in the 1880s. Its use was short-lived, as it closed in 1915 after years of soot and smoke built up within the space and made it dangerous for the trains’ crews and passengers to pass through. One end of the tunnel became sealed shut so it could become a reservoir. The north entrance, too, became blocked from years of mucky debris building up outside. The whole tunnel was nearly hidden behind a thick veil of lush flora. Before it was drained and partially cleared in 1995, the entire passageway was full of stagnant water. But the tunnel wasn’t completely abandoned during this time. A colony of glowworms—one of the largest in all of New South Wales—moved in and made its home on the roof. The insects illuminate the stale, inky air like a constellation of blue-green stars. The tunnel still floods fairly frequently. On days where the water level is particularly high, people pass through the small waterfall that often tumbles across the entrance after heavy rains with pool floats or inflatable canoes in hand. They then paddle deep into the darkness until they reach the spots where the ceiling becomes brightest with the soft glow of the bioluminescent bugs.",glowing bioluminescence insects tunnels infrastructure subterranean sites abandoned
50,Gippsland Lakes Bioluminescence,"Raymond Island, Australia",Australian Lake set aglow by Noctiluca Scintillans.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-gippsland,"The conditions were rare, and they were perfect. Starting with a series of bush fires in 2006, followed by torrential rains in 2007, by 2008 massive amounts of ash and nitrogen rich soul was washed into the Gippsland Lakes in Southeast Australia. While this would have normally resulted in a bloom of bacteria, because of the scale of the fires and the flood, that year something unusual happened. A massive algae bloom of Noctiluca Scintillans, visible as murky red patches during the day, appeared replacing the more usual normal green Synechococcus. But the Noctiluca Scintillans had another trick up its sleeve: at night it glowed. In the summer of 2008 and 2009, the shores of the Gippsland Lakes glowed a faint blue at night as the bacteria were agitated by movement in the water. Anyone taking a skinny dip at night would find the water glowing spectacularly around them. The lakes have since lessened in bioluminescence - a good thing as the bacteria blooms are harmful to other life in the lake - and it may be a very long time until a bioluminescent event of that scale happens again on the lake. However, those who are willing to head out for a midnight swim in Gippsland can still often catch a faint glowing about them during the summer months of the year.",bioluminescence water
51,Paronella Park,"Mena Creek, Australia",A castle hand-built by a Spanish dreamer in the Australian tropical jungle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paronella-park,"Technically, José Paronella was on his honeymoon with his wife Margarita, but his trip from Spain to Australia in 1925 was also the beginning of years of labor and the creation of a dream estate in a lush jungle. On five hectares (about 12 acres) in North Queensland, Paronella first planted thousands of trees to create the right environment for his vision. He then built the Grand Staircase to help him carry river sand up the hill to make concrete, with which he built first his house, then a grand castle inspired by those of Spain, and installed the oldest hydro-electric dam in North Queensland. Among the park’s features include the theater, foyer and refreshment rooms within the castle, a fountain built by Paronella, and the concrete benches he built next to a beautiful waterfall. After a decade of labor, the park opened in 1935. José Paronella continued to labor tirelessly on the park, fixing it after a bad flood in 1946, until his death in 1948. He had been laboring on the park for the last 21 years. Without his tireless energy, it became difficult to upkeep the park and over the years, the park was badly damaged by natural disasters; floods, fires and a cyclone decimated it. Though José’s children and grandchildren continued to own and care for the park for many years, by 1977 the park was sold. After a fire struck in 1979, and Cyclone Winifred in 1986, the park was closed for good. But, in 1993, the Park was purchased by Mark and Judy Evans and reopened to the public. The Evans see their role as that of maintaining and preserving the great work of art created by José Paronella. The park now operates tours throughout the day, as well as a spectacular evening tour. They recommend you spend at least three hours exploring both the natural and man-made wonders, from the grand staircase and castle to the waterfall and magnificent flowers. Paronella Park has won numerous tourism awards and was listed as a National Trust in 1997. Additionally, in 2008, they updated the hydro-electric system, which generates all the power for the park and puts power back into the grid for neighboring towns. To seal this Hollywood ending, Australian director Ben Hackworth plans to make a feature film of the history of the park. Admission to the park includes a night stay in their caravan park, annual admission, guided tours, and two maps.  one hour drive south of Cairns",architectural oddities architecture
52,Newnes Glow Worm Tunnel,"Putty, Australia","Once the path of a railway tunnel, now home to thousands of glowing insects.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/newnes-glow-worm-tunnel,"Sometimes, abandoned man-made structures turn into dangerous eyesores, rotting away slowly before returning to nature or being torn down. But other times, abandoned structures take on a new semi-natural life all their own, like a crab who uses a jar for a shell. Such is the case with the Newnes railroad tunnel. The Newnes railroad was closed in 1932 after 25 years of shipping oil shale. The rails were pulled out of the 600-meter tunnel, which had been bored through the sandstone in the Wollemi National Park, and the tunnel was left to its own devices. For Newnes, that meant becoming home to thousands and thousands of glow worms. The glow worm is a catch-all name for the bioluminescent larvae of various species, in this case, the Arachnocampa richardsae, a type of fungus gnat. Found in massive numbers in caves, the fungus gnat larvae cling to the rocky walls of the abandoned tunnel and hunt with long, glowing strings of sticky mucus. To see the glowing gnats, enter the tunnel during daylight hours, and head to the middle - it gets dark in the middle where there is a bend in the tunnel - with a flashlight, so as not to bump into the walls. Turn off the light and wait a minute or two. One by one, the gnats will begin to shine like stars emerging in the night. A similar cave can be found in New Zealand at the Waitomo Glow Worm Cave.  There are several ways to get to the Newnes Glow Worm tunnel: 22km walk each way: Walk for 22km along the route of the old railway line from Newnes 9km return walk: Drive to the weir over the Wolgan River 7km before Newnes. Walk up the nearby fire trail to the railway line to the right Walk or cycle in from Newnes State forest Drive from Lithgow or Clarence (both roads eventually join up), about 25km bumpy dirt road, and walk 1km to the tunnel.",bioluminescence obscura day locations tunnels subterranean sites caves ecosystems ruins animals
53,William Ricketts Sanctuary,"Mount Dandenong, Australia",A collection of outdoor mystical statues paying homage to indigenous Australians and ecological stewardship.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/william-ricketts-sanctuary,"A mere hour from Melbourne, in the Dandenong Ranges, one finds a landscape of huge pine trees and beautiful fern gullies. In one of such gullies, a man’s life-work and dreams live on. Born in 1898, William Ricketts began developing his skill in clay modeling in his teen years. In the 1930s he purchased a four-acre plot of land on Mount Dandenong, naming it ‘Potter’s Sanctuary’. Beginning in 1934, William Ricketts started work on his clay figures that would soon adorn all of his property. In the 1960s, after having gained some local notoriety for his sculptures, the Victorian Government bought the sanctuary and some surrounding land to become a park for public use. He continued to live on and work in his Sanctuary until 1993 when he passed away. Between 1949 and 1960, Rickett traveled often into the desert interior of Central Australia. It was here that he spent time with both Arrente and Pitjantjatjara indigenous people. These native peoples not only inspired his work as models but influenced his philosophy as well. Rickett is known for his belief that all humans should be stewards of the land, just as the indigenous people he spent time with were. The goal of his life-long project was to provide a relaxing setting where one could reflect on man’s oft forgotten connection to nature. Nestled in a glade covered in fern and mountain ash trees, William Ricketts’ masterpiece feels alive. Some covered in moss, the 92 ceramic sculptures in the park all blend seamlessly into their natural surroundings. “Each one of us is a transformer of Divine Power and when love finds form in sculpture and music we are richly blessed because through such we can reach God… Man is nature’s masterpiece, therefore claim your inheritance by giving her the co-operation you owe.” -William Ricketts William Ricketts Sanctuary is about 40 km east of Melbourne.

Arranged like orderly guards, they tower over the earth, some reaching up to 180 feet high. Sunlight filters through their leaves, dappling the forest floor and illuminating the strange portals and enormous nests scattered about. Walking through the California Redwood Forest in East Warburton, Australia, is like entering a magical realm. You’ll come across bird nests so large they’d dwarf even dragon eggs and round circles woven from sticks that look like portals into another world. This tree art, built from twigs and branches, adds to the forest’s enchanted feel. It brings a touch of mystical whimsy to a woodland originally planted for practical purposes. The trees were planted in the 1930s as part of a revegetation program. Arranged in a grid formation, it was hoped they could help control the weeds that had begun to thrive in the previously cleared land. Later, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works used the woodland to study forest hydrology. Though their studies have since ended, the Redwood Forest still attracts its share of experiments, though these are more artistic in nature. It’s common to find the work of artist David Digapony scattered throughout the trees. His creations, which he makes by weaving together fallen branches, bring a bit of unexpected enchantment to the otherwise orderly forest. Follow the Warburton Highway east out of Warburton until it becomes Woods Point Road. Around four miles out of town you will find Cement Creek Road to the left side of the road. Travel a bit farther, the road is unsealed and a little rough in places but suitable for a car.

Once a center of industry, Homebush Bay was unfortunately contaminated with toxic waste and is now a commercial and residential suburb of Sydney after having been refurbished by the economic boom brought on by the 2000 Olympic games. However, the bay’s past as a successful trading port still lingers on in the form of four abandoned freighters slowly rusting in the waters. Once used to transport coal, oil, and war supplies, the ships were eventually decommissioned and simply left where they floated. The most remarkable of these wrecks is the SS Ayrfield, which has miraculously sprouted a lush forest of mangrove trees. The branches of the thriving trees spill from the sides of the ship, slowly breaking down the hull of the long-lived ship which was originally built in 1911. The trees have so completely overtaken the ship, it is a wonder that it still floats. The SS Ayrfield may have survived World War II, but nothing can combat the encroaching hand of nature.

Made out of millennia of layers of stone, this natural formation looks as though it is actually petrified water. At almost 50 feet high and over 300 feet long, Wave Rock’s impressive size and shape have been drawing crowds for decades. It’s an example of what geologists call a “flared slope,” which forms at the base of an inselberg (an isolated rock hill or mountain that juts from a plain). There are several other examples of this throughout Australia, though none as impressive as Wave Rock. The amazing formation is actually just one side of an entire hill known as Hyden Rock, The “wave” is just one side of it. Along the top of the wave, a low stone wall has been built that looks too flimsy for protection and too ugly for decoration. In fact, it’s there to guide rainwater to the nearby Hyden Humps Dam. The wall was built in the 1920s in order to help bring water to people living in the arid area, and it continues to serve the same purpose today. The incredibly fluid undulations of the wave are not the only incredible geologic sites in the area either. After uncounted millennia of erosion and sedimentary activity, there are also locations such as the Hippo’s Yawn, which is a natural cave that looks, as it says on the label, like the wide maw of a giant hippopotamus.

Despite the clear demand for an easier pass up to the Three Sisters, the Giant Stairway was almost not to be. When the walkway was initially conceived, the cost of etching all those steps into the hillside was dismissed but just a few years later, a new Chief Ranger was hired who had a bit more vision. Realizing the potential revenue a grand new path would bring to the park new boss Jim McKay put forth the idea again, just two years later after the first proposal and it was approved. Unfortunately, the project only got a fourth of the way up the path when etching the grand staircase out of the rock was deemed too expensive and the whole construction was stopped. However, the tenacious ranger continued lobbying for the path and work was eventually recommenced, this time using metal stairs instead of using the ground itself. Today, the Giant Staircase is complete and leads up 800 stairs rising over 1,000 feet in elevation, to one of Australia’s most picturesque vistas, and just as McKay predicted, draws huge amounts of visitors each year.",stairs nature

It’s one of the surviving above-ground remnants of the once-lost (and recently found) sunken continent of Zealandia. Ball’s Pyramid lies about 14 miles east of Lord Howe Island. It rises some 1,800 feet out of the water and measures about half a mile in length and 980 feet across, which makes it the tallest volcanic stack in the world. The formation is visible from Mount Gower Track on Lord Howe Island. Discovered in 1788 by Royal Navy Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, hence the name, the rocky spire was thought to be largely devoid of animal life until 2001 when a group of scientists discovered there what may be the world’s rarest insect. The Lord Howe Island stick insect (Dryococelus australis) had not been seen alive in over 70 years. Known as “land lobsters” or “walking sausages,” the six-inch-long insects were once common on the neighboring Lord Howe Island, but were assumed to have been eaten to extinction by the black rats introduced to the island when a supply ship ran aground on its shores in 1918. In 2001, the scientists found a colony of the huge Lord Howe Island stick insects living under a single bush, a hundred feet up. Somehow a few of the wingless insects escaped and managed, by means still unknown, to traverse 14 miles of open ocean, land on Ball’s Pyramid, and survive there. Just 27 of the insects have been found on the spire. They are currently being bred in captivity.",insects volcanoes geological oddities islands natural wonders geology nature animals

To distract herself from the pain, she began clearing garbage and weeds from a patch of land overlooking a railway yard. She’s spent the past 25 years transforming the patch of land into something incredibly beautiful: a secret, hidden garden. No one ever told her to stop. Fueled even further by the later grief of the loss of her only daughter, Wendy kept transforming the forgotten lot into what it is today. She doesn’t actually own the land, but in 2015, the New South Wales Government gave a 30-year lease to North Sydney Council that will allow the garden to continue evolving and thriving. The garden is a quiet alternative to the bustling, more touristy parts of Sydney Harbour. It’s a lush, green landscape, full of vivid greenery and a handful of whimsical sculptures.

The lake is a “perched lake” meaning it exists well above the water table and is thus comprised of pure rainwater only. This unique environment, along with the high levels of acidity in the lake, makes the water unsuitable for nearly all forms of plant and fish life. Without natural waste from plant and animal life, the lake is extremely pure. Strangely enough, the lake is too pure to sustain natural life that would otherwise inhabit its waters. Along with the clean water, the sand around Lake McKenzie is pure silica, giving the beach a shimmering white color. The famous heart-shaped-tree adds to the already pretty landscape.

Unlike most beaches in the world, Whitehaven is made of 98% pure silica which gives the sand its snowy complexion in addition to some other unique traits. The silica sand is of a finer grain than regular beach sand which is comprised of irregular bits of minerals. This gives the white sand a softer, more velvety feel. In addition, since silica does not retain heat well, the sands do not heat up in the summer sun, making the immaculate beach the perfect place to relax and sunbathe. Even stranger is that the surrounding rocks do not contain silica, meaning the beach must have been deposited on the island over millions of years of tides carrying the silica grains. To keep the beach in its heavenly state, regulations have been put in place outlawing dogs and cigarettes which might mar the posh surroundings.

Although these depressions look distinctly manmade, they are the result of a rare type of natural erosion. Occurring near sea coasts on flat rock which has broken into regular blocks, the effect is known as “tessellated pavement” for its resemblance to Roman mosaic floors (also called tessellated pavement). The pavement takes two forms. Depressions are known as pan formations, occurring when saltwater wears away the center portion of the stones into pools. The opposite effect is known as a loaf formation, when the edges of the stone are worn away leaving a rounded crown resembling rising bread. Tessellated pavement is extremely rare, found only in a few places on Earth. The geology is not related to the effect that created the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland and Fingal’s Cave in Scotland. Those features were formed as basaltic lava cooled and fractured; tessellated pavement occurs as sedimentary rock erodes. Eaglehawk Neck is also famous for its association with the prison colony at Port Arthur. In 1832, a military outpost was setup to watch for escaping prisoners, and dogs were positioned along the isthmus to raise a ruckus if they spotted an escapee. The motley army of dogs were described in 1840: “There were the black, the white, the brindle, the grey and the grisly, the rough and the smooth, the crop-eared and the lop-eared, the gaunt and the grim. Every four-footed, black-fanged individual among them would have taken first prize in his own class for ugliness and ferocity at any show.” Port Arthur closed in 1877 (it’s now open as a tourist attraction), but there is a monument to the dogs at Eaglehawk Neck. Along with the tessellated pavement, there are several other unusual geologic formations, including a natural arch and blowhole nearby.

While the station serves nearly 100,000 travelers a day, the old third floor ballroom, closed off from the public since 1985, rarely opens its doors to visitors. Viewing the space has been so coveted in recent years that during Open House Melbourne (an annual celebration of design and urban preservation) special entry was granted by a secret “Golden Ticket,” tucked into a lucky few visitors’ programs. Designed in 1899 by James Fawcett and H. P. C. Ashworth, Flinders Street Station opened in 1910, and quickly became a Melbourne icon. The space occupied by the Ballroom was originally the lecture hall of the Victorian Railways Institute, an association established to provide “betterment of railway staff.” This included night courses, a lending library, and physical fitness classes. There were also “men only” spaces, such as a billiard room, table tennis, and a private gym with a boxing ring and running track on the roof. The heyday of the ballroom was in the 1950s and 60s, when public dances would fill the hall, always sure to finish on time so they could catch the last train home. All these accommodations are long gone, but the spaces they occupied are there, just waiting to be rediscovered. As of early 2017, the station is about to undergo a major overhaul and renovation, including a return to the original colors of the early 20th century. For the ballroom itself, the Victorian Government has put together a business plan to bring it all back to life—hopefully that will happen soon. The dancers are just waiting to catch that train.  The Flinders Street Station is in downtown Melbourne, at the corner of Flinders and Swanston. The ballroom is located under the light-coloured roof, accessed via the 3rd floor eastern side of the station.

The town’s name comes from the Aboriginal term for “boy’s waterhole,” but the joke is that it actually means “white man in a hole.” While Aboriginal people have long inhabited the area, miners first moved to Coober Pedy in 1916 after the discovery of opal in the surrounding rocks. As a result of the intense heat, a number of miners living in town have chosen to live underground, either in the beginnings of old mines or in purpose-dug underground houses. This has continued with much of the modern town being built underground. Among the local public buildings found underground are three churches, a bookstore, an art gallery, a bar, and hotels. Opals can be seen embedded in the walls of some of these hotel rooms. The area doesn’t support much life and the first “tree” in the town was welded together from scrap iron. The metal tree can still be seen on a hill overlooking the town. The daytime temperatures of Cooper Pedy in the summer get so high than most sporting activities take place at night. Golf played with glowing balls is a popular pastime. The towns unusual and bleak landscape, made even stranger by the mining efforts, has made it an attractive location for Hollywood. Coober Pedy has appeared in a number of movies, including “Pitch Black”, “Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome,” and “Red Planet”. One must be careful in Coober Pedy, however. The area around the town is riddled with pits and caverns dug in search of opals. This is especially true at night when one is out playing a round of glowing golf. Worth looking out for are Crocodile Harry’s Underground Nest, a bizarrely decorated cave home, and screenings at the Coober Pedy Drive-In, a popular event in the town.  Coober Pedy is accessible via a small airstrip, via coach tour or private car, and via the Ghan railway line running between Darwin and Adelaide.

At a height of over 300 meters, these cliffs stand guard over the rest of the island. There are a few adventurous rock climbers who have tackled the terrifying cliffs of Cape Pillar, and their excursions up its flat stone walls have been the stuff of legend. The winds and the water below aren’t the only things to watch out for when ascending the chasm. Various climbers of the chasm tell stories that sound like they belong in the pages of The Odyssey. One of the climbers recalled seeing a great white shark lurking in the waters, and another climber believes that the Australian rock climbing grade of 22 (medium-hard) could not properly explain the amount of the fear and difficulty such a climb entailed. Tales full of rope burn, broken digits, and a few unexpected swims in the water below pepper the tales of the brave few who have climbed these jagged walls.

69,Giant Pink Slugs of Mount Kaputar,"Kaputar, Australia",The unique ecosystem atop an Australian mountain is home to some colorful inhabitants.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giant-pinks-slugs-of-mount-kaputar,"The small alpine forest at Mount Kaputar’s peak is believed by scientists to be the result of unique circumstances that have preserved a tiny remnant of Australia’s geological past. Measuring only 10 by 10 kilometers (roughly 6.2 miles squared), this forest is teeming with life found nowhere else in the world. Millions of years ago, when Australia was part of a larger landmass known as Gondwana, the terrain was characterized by lush rainforests. Since then conditions on the continent have changed drastically, with dryer climes all but wiping out the region’s rainforest-specific species. A volcanic eruption on Mount Kaputar 17 million years ago is believed to be responsible for preserving the cooler, damper conditions needed to support the summit’s rainforest-era relics. By far the most colorful of member of this ecosystem is the giant pink slug (Triboniophorus aff. graeffei), which can reach a whopping 7.8 inches in length. These slugs spend most of their time buried beneath the leaf mold on which they feed, but according to Michael Murphy, a New South Wales parks ranger who regularly patrols Mount Kaputar’s summit, they’re known to come out in the hundreds by night or after a rain shower to snack on tree moss. “As bright pink as you can imagine, that’s how pink they are,” said Murphy in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Other unique species found at Mount Kaputar’s summit include not one but three different cannibal snail species which prey on their vegetarian brethren by following their tell-tale slime trails. The ecosystem atop Mount Kaputar hangs in a delicate balance, and a temperature increase of only one or two degrees has the potential to dry up the mountain’s peculiar residents. In an effort to preserve this distinct habitat, the NSW Scientific Committee has begun steps to designate the area an Endangered Ecological Community.",slugs mountains geological oddities natural wonders geology nature animals
70,Melbourne Storm Tunnels,"Melbourne, Australia",The labyrinthine storm tunnels beneath the city of Melbourne are ruled by a band of urban explorers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/melbourne-storm-tunnels,"Constructed separately from the sewer system, the storm drain tunnels beneath Melbourne, Australia are a warren of over 900 miles of concrete and brick tubes, chambers and waterfalls, all of which are slowly being explored by a committed group of urban adventurers. The massive system of twisting tunnels was first broached by the area’s most prominent urban exploration team in 1987 when the collective claimed the ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) drain as their own. Since then, the tunnels and chambers off of this giant drain and others around Melbourne have been being explored by the group despite the constant threat of flash floods, claustrophobia, and whatever giant insectile Australian fauna has made a home in the darkness. While the ANZAC drain and its attendant large chamber act as the unofficial headquarters a number of other drains have been found and explored and given mythic names such as The Maze, The God, and The Tenth Drain. The Melbourne Storm Tunnels might look like matte paintings from an urban gothic genre piece, but they are in fact quite dangerous. Despite this, parties are thrown in the damp, spacious chambers and graffiti artists regularly delve into the depths to leave their mark. For an in-depth view of life in the tunnels check out our first-hand account!  It's worth noting that while these laws aren't enforced, entering these drains is illegal and punishable by a very large fine. Furthermore, as they are storm drains, mild rainfall 30km away accumulates further towards the mouth and flash floods are a real danger, along with methane/co2 buildup in some areas.",subterranean tunnels subterranean sites
71,Wedding Cake Rock,"Royal National Park, Australia",A sparkling sandstone cliffside that's worth a visit while it still exists.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wedding-cake-rock,"Wedding Cake Rock is a gleaming anomaly along Australia’s rugged coastline. Although it seems like a carefully crafted sculpture with its bleached white color, illusion of layers, and straight lines, this incredible cliffside is an entirely natural formation. Unlike the iron-rich and orange-tinged sandstone found across the rest of the area, Wedding Cake Rock is a light limestone. Its peculiar shape is the result of a fortuitous original formation and millions of years of erosion. Suspended at 82 feet above sea level, the cuboid rock is almost impossibly scenic. Unfortunately, its beauty may also be its undoing. Time has been tough on the spectacular formation, and a steady stream of photo-happy tourists have sped its decline. Although new viewing platforms are in the works, public access to the rock was closed off in 2015. A recent geotechnical assessment of the formation by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) found Wedding Cake Rock to be “precariously balancing on the edge of the cliff and severely undercut.” The implication is that the entire rock formation could collapse into the ocean… in as little as ten years time. Curious visitors wanting a slice of Wedding Cake Rock’s incredible views are advised to make their way to the cake sooner rather than later, before the Tasman Sea gobbles up more than its fair share.  Take the ferry from Cronulla to Bundeena. Once there follow the signs to the Royal National Park and take the 'Coastal Walk' route. It's about 1.8 miles (3km) from the beginning of the walk. Wedding Cake Rock is unstable and now has a fence around it. It's a good idea to stay behind the fenced off areas. Standing or sitting on the rock or cliff edges poses a very high safety risk.

72,Gould's Book Arcade,"Sydney, Australia",Australia's largest secondhand bookstore.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gould-s-books,"By way of describing what it is, exactly, that Gould’s is all about, the store’s official website just displays a few pictures of the interior on its “About Us” page. Each of the pictures shows the inside of a building that is literally covered in books. There are books stacked from the floor to the ceiling, books covering display shelves and racks, books lining the staircases that lead from the first to the second floor. And books just about everywhere else one could fit a book, paperback or hardcover. Time Out Sydney described the store, which is located just 5 km from the city’s famous opera house and harbour bridge, this way: “A hurricane would do a better job of ordering their tens of thousands of books, but if you go in there with some time to kill and a keen eye, you’re bound to exit with armfuls of second-hand treasures.” Bob Gould, the proprietor has been selling books in Sydney since 1967 and in Newtown, the current home of his store, since 1988. Gould often buys publishers’ remainders, which is why his stock is so large. He also buys books from people who wander into his store looking to get rid of already-read volumes that they no longer have room to store. He believes that having a wide range of books is best for his customers; they’ll never leave without finding something that might interest them. “Our shop is about the size of two singles tennis courts, and the books are in broad subject areas, so allow a bit of time,” Gould’s Book Arcade’s official website warns. “Newtown, as well as being renowned for its many bookshops, is also known for its great variety of cheap restaurants, and many of our customers make a night of it.” So, if you’re in the area, plan a trip to Newtown - for the food and for the books. Bob Gould passed away on May 22, 2011. He was 74 years old. His family reopened the store a few hours after his death as it was what he would have wanted, and it has remained in business to this day. Update: Gould’s has permanently moved to 536 King St Newtown and the old location is closed.",bookstores purveyors of curiosities shops
73,Wineglass Bay,"Freycinet, Australia",One of the best beaches in the entire world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wineglass-bay,"Voted by several travel authorities one of the best beaches in the entire world, Wineglass Bay is famous for the red and pink granite formations that make it so beautiful to tourists. The Devonian Granite is the dominant type of rock in the area. A pink feldspar that gives the coastlines their characteristic pink tint, the rock is also mixed with white quartz and other types of rock. The crystal clear water isn’t so bad either. Part of the Freycinet National Park on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, that also includes a large chunk of the rugged Tasmanian coastline, Wineglass Bay has a climate that is similar to that of France, but with more than 300 days of sunshine every year. Recognized around the world as one of Tasmania’s iconic destinations, Wineglass Bay is more than just a place to picnic or camp. Wineglass attracts tourists who are looking to do some birdwatching (white-bellied sea-eagles are plentiful), deep sea fishing, scuba diving, mountain biking, beach walking, and rock climbing. Freycinet is one of the oldest parks in Tasmania, having been founded in 1916 along with Mount Feld National Park. The park is home to not just Wineglass Bay, but also 49 endemic species of plants and several animals, including the Brushtail Possum, the New Holland Mouse, the Tasmanian Bettong, and the Long-nosed Potoroo.

74,Mungo National Park,"Arumpo, Australia",Prehistoric park filled with the fossils of dozens of extinct species including Australian megafauna.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mungo-national-park,"To the naked eye the “Willandra Lakes Region” is a misnomer. The lakes dried up 19,000 years ago, but their fossil remains are a boon for paleontologists. “How do lakes leave fossils?” you may wonder. In the 30,000 years that the lakes were filled with fresh water, they collected and deposited layers of sediment, which were revealed as the water evaporated. Over time, winds have swept away top layers of soil, revealing beautiful dunes and rock formations. The Willandra Lakes Region encompasses Mungo National Park, a protected area in isolated New South Wales about 550 miles from Sydney. In Mungo, visitors flock to the Walls of China where the stratified layers of the ancient shoreline appear in great relief. Mungo also gave its name to two of the greatest discoveries of archaeology - the Mungo Man and Mungo Lady. Mungo Lady was the name given to partially cremated remains also found in Mungo National Park. These remains point to a ritualized burial ceremony involving multiple burnings. The buried remains of the Mungo Man date back 40,000 years, the oldest evidence of humans on the Australian continent. Also, 460 footprints of adults, adolescents, and children dating back 19,000 to 23,000 years ago were found here. Humans have occupied this area regularly for the past 40,000 years, and their tools and other remnants continue to be found along what was once the banks of the lakes. The remains of many animals have also been found in the region, including 40 species that are now extinct, even megafauna of pre-historic Australia. Because of its archaeological and natural importance, the Willandra Lakes Region was named by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee as one of its World Heritage Sites in 1981. Today in Mungo National Park visitors can explore the prehistoric lakes and watch cockatoos, parrots, bats, and kangaroos in their natural habitat. Rains can make roads to the park impassable and many visitors go with a tour group because of the isolated locale of the park.  Mungo isn't a highly visited park. It is located in the outback near a point where Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales meet. The starting point for most tours is the town of Mildura, Victoria.",martian landscapes geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems geology nature

In combination with the delicate visuals above, sound artwork rises from below in a wave of calls of long-vanished birds. “Forgotten Songs” is a collaboration of art and ornithology, to remember the calls of 50 birds that once thrived in Sydney, that have either been pushed to the city fringes or drowned out altogether in the wake of accelerated development. Originally part of a collection of installations called “Laneways By George! Hidden Networks,” it started as a temporary exhibit, part of an initiative to remind the urbanites of  of some neglected sounds and spaces of a more human scale. The recordings are from species that all once chirped in central Sydney, and they change along with the time of day to match their natural habits. So morning birds sing in the morning, and nocturnal birds call out at night. The original installation proved so popular, funds were provided by the city to make it permanent, as a lovely, mournful way to remember a long-vanished part of Sydney life.  You can get to Forgotten Songs either from George or Pitt Streets, and it is a great way to get in the mood for a visit to the nearby Angel Place Recital Hall.

Named after Loch Ard, a clipper ship that ran aground back in June 1878 on the nearby Muttonbird Island, Loch Ard Gorge is accessible via the Great Ocean Road. Constructed stairs allow visitors to access the beach, which is otherwise undeveloped. The only other constructed sites nearby are a small museum that details the area’s history, a number of plaques detailing geological features, and a cemetery that houses many of the people that have died in the region. The erosion that is discussed both on the plaques detailing the site and in any conversations about Loch Ard Gorge is noticeable in the arches. The arch on the nearby Island Archway collapsed back in June 2009. The two unconnected pillars have been named Eva and Tom after the two teenage survivors of the Loch Ard shipwreck, which ran aground on nearby Muttonbird Island. Of the fifty-one passengers and crew members aboard the Loch Ard, all on a three-month journey from England to Melbourne, only two managed to survive the crash back in 1878. Loch Ard Gorge was the location for a number of scenes from The Pirate Movie, a 1982 film, and Journey to the Center of the Earth, a 1999 television series featuring Treat Williams.

Despite the crater’s ancient geological age, it was not actually discovered until 1947, when researchers conducting an aerial survey of the area happened to stumble upon it. The local aboriginal peoples had known of the crate’s existence long before it was “discovered,” calling it “Kandimalal.” However, the crater got its current name after the scientists found it, naming it after a shopkeeper that founded nearby Halls Creek. But no matter what you call it, one thing is certain, and that is that the meteor that created the crater must have been huge. According to scientists studying the site, the space rock likely touched down around 300,000 years ago. The diameter of the crater stretches to almost 3,000 feet and is almost 200 feet deep. Given these measurements researchers theorize that the hole was probably created by a meteor of some 50,000 tons. Supposedly small fragments of the original meteor can still be found littering the area, so if you visit, be sure to keep your eyes on the ground. The crater and the surrounding area are protected as a national park. The crater was brought to greater fame when it was featured in the slasher horror film Wolf Creek.",craters meteorites natural wonders nature

Nicknamed the “Horries,” the twin waterfalls known as the Horizontal Falls in Talbot Bay Western Australia certainly look like they are living up to their name. However, the strange flows are actually just tidal waters that rush through a pair of gaps in two stony gorges. As the waters rush through the gaps they look like weirdly flat waterfalls even though they are very much not on a slant. The water level rises with the tides and the excess water is shoved out through the small gap until it returns to normal. As the tides swell in and out the direction of the flow changes, pushing water either into or out of the gorges. While the gorges are fed by seawater, the landward gorge is also supplied by freshwater from a creek. The gaps in the rock are wide enough to allow the passage of boats, and can make for a stunning water adventure in the shadow of the high gorge cliffs. If you the taking to the water isn’t your thing, the most stunning view of the falls is from the air. You just have to find someone to fly you over them.

80,The Stromatolites of Hamelin Pool,Australia,Living fossils in this remote Australian bay provide a glimpse of what Earth may have looked like 3.5 billion years ago.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-stromatolites-of-hamelin-pool-australia,"Situated within a sheltered bay on the coast of Western Australia, Hamelin Pool appears at first glance to be a moderately interesting rock-strewn beach. Those rocks look kind of odd; are they from a lava flow, or some arcane tectonic process? However, those rocks are not actually rocks. Rather, they are active colonies of one of the first life forms on the planet. The rock-like objects that appear at Hamelin Pool in remarkable numbers are called stromatolites, and they are made by a single-celled organism called cyanobacteria. Previously known as blue-green algae, cyanobacteria came onto the scene about 3500 million years ago, well before the existence of any other complex life form. They are the oldest type of photosynthetic organism in the world — so old, in fact, that they predate plants by a couple of billion years, and provided the earth with most of the oxygen in the atmosphere necessary for supporting subsequent life forms. Additionally, cyanobacteria are the earliest and were, for three-quarters of the earth’s history, the main reef-building organism, thanks to their peculiar stromatolites. They are formed using sediment trapped in the sticky cyanobacteria’s mucosal secretions, which is then cemented with calcium carbonate produced by the tiny organism. With a colony of millions of bacteria carrying out this process, the stromatolite grows over time at a rate of approximately 0.5mm per year. While stromatolite fossils — some of them 3.5 billion years old — have been found around the world, the stromatolites of Hamelin Pool were the first living specimens ever discovered. Happened upon by oil surveyors in 1956, living stromatolites remain extremely rare, known to exist in only a small handful of places in the entire world. Hamelin Pool contains the most abundant and diverse collection of living stromatolites, thanks to the hypersaline water (twice the salinity of normal seawater) that allows the cyanobacteria to thrive and keeps would-be predators at bay. Additionally, the Hamelin Pool stromatolites are also the easiest to observe, thanks to the clear, shallow water and boardwalk that has been built out into the water, allowing visitors to see the ancient formations without disturbing their habitat. There is also a museum in the nearby Historic Hamelin Pool Telegraph Station that includes an aquarium containing the only living stromatolite in captivity in the world.  To get there, you will need either a car or a tour group that provides transportation. You can see the stromatolites easily at Hamelin Pool where there is a boardwalk and interpretive signs.",fossils beaches ancient

Southern Sassafras, Celery-top pine, and Myrtle Beach also fill the rainforests of the region. In the Styx Valley Forest, adventurers - what else would you call them, wading into the dark and disturbing forest? - discovered the most massive tree in all of Australia in 2002. They nicknamed it El Grande because it was, well, grand. You get the idea. And then it burned down in an autumn fire the following year, 2003. The fall of El Grande is symbolic of the larger, ongoing conflict between environmentalists, who have asked for the Styx Valley Forest to be protected by naming it a National Park, and representatives of the logging industry. A tourism-based economy would be beneficial to the local economy and, once established, could last for a long, long time. This is the argument, or one of the arguments, that the environmentalists make. But the logging industry, dependent on the wood that is chopped from the edges of the forest, will fight with powerful lobbyists and huge percentages of their profits to keep the site from ever becoming protected. Over the years, though, the environmentalists have done all they could to make their voices heard. The community has organized tree sits, many supported by Greenpeace and the Tasmanian Wilderness Society, in which members build a platform and position themselves in the trees they want to keep from getting cut down. Gandalf’s Staff, an 85-meter-tall tree that is named for one of the characters in Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings series, holds the world record for supporting the highest tree-sit platform. A good place to start to explore the Styx Valley is the Mt. Field National Park Office which is just over one hour's drive from Hobart via New Norfolk.",natural wonders plants nature

In a moment of life imitating art, the “London Bridge” rock bridge really did fall down, stranding the couple on a spire of rock out in the sea. The couple kept waving at people for help, trying to attract attention to their predicament (they were too far away to be heard) but the other tourists just kept waving back at them. Finally, someone realized their predicament and the stranded couple was airlifted to safety. Originally known as the Sow and Piglets until 1922—Muttonbird Island, near Loch Ard Gorge, was the Sow, and the smaller rock stacks the Piglets—the formations were then renamed The Apostles for tourism purposes. The formation eventually became known as the Twelve Apostles, despite only ever having nine stacks. The Apostles are a collection of eight Miocene limestone rock stacks jutting from the water in Port Campbell National Park, between Princetown and Peterborough on the Great Ocean Road. Formed by erosion, approximately 10 to 20 million years ago, the harsh weather conditions from the Southern Ocean gradually eroded the soft limestone to form caves in the cliffs, which would then become arches, which in turn would collapse—as in the case of the “London Bridge”—leaving rock stacks up to 45 meters high. Tourism activities (including helicopter tours) are conducted from a visitor center situated on the inland side of the Great Ocean Road, with parking and viewing areas.",geological oddities natural wonders geology nature
84,Shell Beach,"Francois Peron National Park, Australia",This Australian beach is composed of tiny shells.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shell-beach,"Shell Beach is one of only two beaches in the world composed entirely of shells, and was created by a unique combination of geography, climate, and marine vegetation. Shell Beach sits on a narrow isthmus within Shark Bay, a peculiar inlet on the coast of Western Australia. Shark Bay is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, thanks to the proliferation of unique marine life found in and near its waters – including dugongs (relatives of manatees), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (who use tools – specifically, sponges – to protect their noses while they scour the seabed for food), various whales and whale sharks, and the largest seagrass bank in the world. That last one might seem underwhelming, but it contributed to the formation of Shell Beach. Shell Beach wraps around the southern end of L’Haridon Bight, one of the most interior precincts of Shark Bay. As a bay in a climate with more evaporation than precipitation, located within a larger bay featuring a massive seagrass bank blocking tidal inflow, L’Haridon Bight boasts a salinity level twice that of the ocean. This is known as “hypersalinity,” and it is favorable to the survival of some marine animals — like, say, cockles — and is unfavorable to others — such as, I don’t know, animals that eat cockles. Thus, L’Haridon Bight has been a veritable cockle paradise for thousands of years, allowing the little bivalves to propagate, flourish, die, and have their shells wash up on shore over and over and over and over again, enough times to create a dazzling snow white beach 110 kilometers (68 miles) long and 10 meters (33 feet) deep. The volume of cockle shell matter produced here is so great that it becomes compressed into a special form of limestone called coquina, which was mined around Shell Beach for the construction of buildings in nearby Denham until the UNESCO protection began in 1991. Today, special licenses are still granted to mine the shells as a source of calcium for mulch and poultry feed. The hypersalinity of L’Haridon Bight keeps out predators of humans as well as cockles, making Shell Beach a popular place to go for a swim.",beach shells beaches

Australia’s Gnomesville, a collection of thousands of the weird little statuettes set up on a roundabout is whole different beast entirely. The community of silent dwarves actually began as a whimsical protest some 20 years ago. As the Gnomesville website explains, a small bit of land in Ferguson Valley was annexed by the local government to create a roundabout. Despite an outcry from the nearby residents, the roundabout was installed, and tensions simmered. Then at some point, a gnome appeared. at first there as just one in a tree hollow, but after a few months, there were around 20. The collection continued to grow as visitors and locals alike came and dropped off their own little statues. In the decades since their first appearance the army of gnomes had exploded into the thousands. For a time, theft and vandalism stunted the growth of the little population, but today the site is fairly well respected and continues to grow as people bring their own gnomes to add to the community. There are so many gnomes now in Gnomesville, that in some spots they are even grouped up into little neighborhoods, where gnomes of the same color or attitude are placed together.

86,Sydney Observatory,"Millers Point, Australia",This historic observatory contains the world's oldest refracting lens telescope.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sydney-observatory,"The Sydney Observatory is home to a working refracting lens telescope which has been in use for over 135 years. It is the oldest working refracting lens telescope in the Southern Hemisphere. In some ways, however, the observatory was built simply to keep another instrument, the “time ball,” functioning. The Time Ball is a large yellow ball, easily visible from the sea, that is dropped at exactly 1:00pm every day. Built in 1858, before the advent of radio, it served as a clear visual signal of the time. Its main purpose was to help ships set their chronometers which kept them on schedule and from running into one another. Initially, the city planned to build only the time ball, but soon realized that without setting the ball to the cosmic clock, it would be useless. Hence an observatory was built and staffed with an astronomer. The ball was originally dropped at noon, but that was soon changed to 1:00pm as Rev. Scott, the Government Astronomer, was generally busy at noon watching the sun cross the north-south meridian. Today the time ball still drops at 1:00pm sharp, but its clock is no longer controlled by an astronomer but by an atomic master clock. The observatory itself remains; it is now a museum of astronomy and pays homage to captain James Cook and his famed voyage following the transit of Venus around the globe. If you go at night you will be able to observe the night sky through both a modern telescope and the historic original telescope from 1874. If it’s a cloudy night, visitors are invited to participate in a planetarium show in a very small planetarium instead. The planetarium show is an experience in itself. You will also still get to use the telescope on a cloudy evening if you’d like, of course, but instead of focusing on the planet Jupiter the astronomers on hand have other fascinating tricks up their sleeve.

87,Penguin Parade At Phillip Island,"Ventnor, Australia","An unphotographable nightly march of tens of thousands of ""fairy penguins"" from sea to shore.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/penguin-parade-at-phillip-island,"Approximately 65 million years ago, “Fairy Penguins” traded their wings for flippers in exchange for the ability to traverse the sea at distances of up to 100 kilometers per day. Today, these little penguins remain the smallest of their kind on Earth, standing at an average height of just 30 centimeters (compared to Antarctica’s famed Emperor Penguins’ imposing 122-centimeter stature). Officially known as the “Little Penguin” for obvious reason, the one million Eudyptula minor on earth exclusively call Australia and New Zealand home. Yet there is one place within their dominion that remains most unique: Phillip Island. Here, a colony of 32,000 of these minuscule penguins makes their way from sea to cubbies on land each and every night at dusk in what has become known as the “Penguin Parade.” Visitors from all over the world flock to the Australian island to witness this most endearing ritual with their own eyes, only to escape largely without proof of it ever having transpired; the birds’ eyes are so light-sensitive as to prohibit nearly all forms of photography (and certainly all those to non-professionals) which renders capturing the tiny, endearing pilgrimage largely impossible, proving that some of nature’s most adorable sights must be seen in person to be believed.",animals

90,"Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney","Sydney, Australia","Come for the flowers, stay for the bats!",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/royal-botanic-gardens-sydney,"Tens of thousands of flying foxes (a cat-sized version of the fruit bat) have set up camp in the central Sydney Royal Botanic Gardens. By day, they roost in the trees, waking at dusk to seek out seeds, nectar, and fruit, spending the evening hours swooping through the air. Visitors to the garden flock to see both the historic plants and the famous bats, but their days are numbered. In fact, these bats have now been moved out of the Royal Botanical Gardens These Grey-headed Flying-foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) are protected in Australia and are listed as a “vulnerable” species due to depopulations over the last 30 or so years. The huge bats are native and unique to Australia, with wingspans sometimes exceeding 3 feet. They are accompanied by a smaller population of Black Flying-foxes (Pteropus alecto). Although normally nomadic, the flying foxes have been known to set up camp in the Botanic Gardens before, with reports going all the way back to the 1850s. The current bat colony has been in place for 20 years, following a bat colony hiatus of 70 years before that. It is currently estimated that the population is as high as 22,000 bats. The problem is that the bats are killing the plants. The weight and movement of all these bats shred bark and break tree branches. According to a report from the Botanic gardens Trust, the colony has killed 26 mature trees, 20 palms, and assorted other plants, with another 300 historic trees currently at risk. As of March 2010, there are plans to relocate the bats, using noise disturbances to discourage them to stay in such a large concentration in the garden. The plan was scheduled to start in the summer of 2010 but has been delayed until 2011 to allow adequate time to tag the animals. Located directly next to the Sydney Opera House, The Royal Botanic Gardens were established in 1819, one of three major botanical gardens in Sydney. The grounds cover about 75 acres of gardens and include historic specimens including those collected at Botany Bay in 1770 by Joseph Banks. It currently contains over 45,000 plants and more than a million preserved specimens in the Herbarium. The exotic gardens are very beautiful and a frequent spot to see couples getting married. During the daylight, the bats stay hanging in the trees so you can feel adventuresome but not worry about them flying into your hair.   The nearest station is Martin Place.

91,Three Sisters,"Katoomba, Australia",This trio of Australian rock spires may have inspired aboriginal legend or just modern tourism.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/three-sisters,"Rising out of Australia’s Blue Mountains, the rock formation known as the Three Sisters is a picturesque natural phenomenon that has inspired an aboriginal legend, or at least it seems that way. Created by millennia of wind and erosion the trio of stone spires known as the Three Sisters has become a popular site for nature tourism. The sandstone formation takes its name from a local tribal legend that tells of three siblings, (Meehni, Wimlah, and Gunnedoo) who fell in love with three men they were not allowed to marry. Unhappy with this arrangement, the men tried to take the women by force, inciting a tribal war. It is said that a witch doctor of some sort turned the sisters to stone in order to protect them, and then passed away before he could change them back. While this story does add some enticing local flavor to bait tourists, it may not actually be an authentic legend. Some have suggested that the popular tale is actually the recent invention of a local man in order to drum up tourist attendance. Whether the myth is truly an aboriginal original or just the invention of a local huckster, the natural beauty of Three Sisters is real enough.",mythology rocks natural wonders geology nature

It’s lined with dozens of coin-operated amusements including claw machines, gachapon (capsule toy) machines, and a few unusual arcade games. The highlight are the many purikura, the cutest of all photobooths. Purikura (an abbreviation of “Purinto Kurabu,” or “Print Club”) are essentially photobooths with a lot of extras added on. They allow the users to edit and enhance their photos, then print them onto stickers immediately. Since their origin in the 1990s, purikura have become a staple of Japanese kawaii culture, which has since filtered into the English-speaking world and beyond. Being that these machines are only made in Japan, all of the instructions are in Japanese, but most machines are easy enough to figure out even if you don’t speak the language. There are a multitude to choose from at Photoland, each with its own aesthetic and effects to make you into an adorable anime version of yourself. Insert your payment, try to parse out the Japanese instructions, and then flash a peace sign at the count of, “Ichi… ni… san!” Most of the purikura take beauty shots—widening your eyes, smoothing out your skin—but some offer green screen images to make it appear as though you are in space, riding a llama, or some other inexplicable setting. In others you can try on different hairstyles, outfits, makeup, etc. to really transform your appearance. Once your photoshoot is over, the real fun begins. The machine will direct you to an editing station where you can add digital stickers, writing, and edits to your pictures. After you’ve added enough glitter and speech bubbles, the photos are printed and you can cut them up with scissors provided on the spot to distribute amongst your friends. There are other vending machine-style amusements and arcade games at Photoland too. Though the prizes in the claw machines are particularly cute, they are no easier to win than in any other claw machine. Some say they are rigged to make you lose on your first couple tries, and the bigger machines are even more difficult to beat, but Sydneysiders with an affinity for kawaii keep coming back for more.

98,Atlantis Marine Park,"Two Rocks, Australia",An abandoned marine theme park has created a difficult experiment in dolphin rewilding.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atlantis-marine-park,"Located in the little town of Two Rocks, just north of Perth, the Roman god Neptune towers over his crumbled kingdom. Atlantis Marine Park was constructed in 1981 with hopes that nearby Perth’s boom times would attract tourism to a shiny new ocean theme park. A ten-meter-tall Neptune holding his trident was built by local artist Mark Le Buse along with numerous pools and many other strange, ocean-themed sculptures including the disembodied head of Jacques Cousteau. The park was to be the first step in turning the area into a “premier leisure recreation region.” The park’s slogan was “Atlantis marine park for the enrichment of mankind.” Six months before its opening, the park’s future stars and main attraction were captured. Seven wild bottlenose dolphins were caught in the lagoon and trained to perform. They would be the main draw of the park for the next ten years. The park did not prove to be the money maker its creators had hoped and by the end of the eighties, it was losing money. The initial set of wild dolphins grew to nine in 1988, when three dolphins were born in captivity. The new arrivals created new issues for the park. Regulations for dolphin enclosures had changed and legislation required the park to build a larger area for the dolphins. Along with an already-dwindling cash flow, the Tokyu Corporation of Japan decided to close the park in 1990. Part of the park’s closing was an unusual agreement with research scientist and marine park veterinarian Dr. Nick Gales. In return for releasing the company from its financial obligation to the dolphins, they gave him permission to attempt to reintroduce the wild dolphins and their captive born offspring back into the wild. It would prove complicated. The hope was to provide a case study for returning other captive dolphins to the open oceans. The first step for the Atlantis Park dolphins was to remind them what survival in the wild entailed. The adult Atlantis dolphins had been performing in captivity for almost a decade, and the captive-born juveniles had never hunted in the wild. They all needed to be shown how to hunt for fish. While some of the dolphins responded immediately, the captive-born dolphins “seemed to treat the exercise as a game and would often all chase the same fish, competing more with each other than actually showing any ability to forage” according to researcher Kelly Waples. While the researchers watched the dolphins, they also attempted to discourage human interaction. Meanwhile, the dolphins watching the human researchers couldn’t quite figure out what the new game was. Puzzled, they would try to get the observers to engage with them. According to researcher Kelly Waples, “A favorite of their antics was to perform a behavior in unison. Although the juveniles were never formally trained, they copied the performance behaviors displayed by the adults during feeding sessions. Quite often, while we were trying to record observations of natural behavior, the juveniles would all stop, watch us for several minutes then in perfect unison embark upon a series of tail slaps or pec waves.” After living in a sea pen which served as a dolphin halfway house, the adults were fitted with radio transmitters and all of the dolphins were released into the wild. Out in the wild, the dolphins struggled. They quickly lost weight. The group structure broke up. One of the juvenile dolphins was reported to be visiting resorts, trying to interact with people, and nearly beaching itself in the process. Ultimately, three of the dolphins proved to be incapable of living in the wild. They were recaptured and lived at UnderWater World (now AQWA), a local aquarium. A wild dolphin frequently visited the enclosure, spending hours on the other side of the net.  In late 1999 all the dolphins mysteriously died in quick succession. The fate of the other dolphins is unclear. The splitting up of the group and failures of the radio tracking made them increasingly difficult to locate. After February of 1992, none of the wild Atlantis dolphins were ever seen again, though occasional reports do come in from local fisherman who claim to have run into unusually friendly dolphins in the area. Since closing, the park’s sculptures have been vandalized regularly. In 2015 volunteers refurbished the King Neptune sculpture and reopened the area to visitors, who can now wander around the site and imagine it as it was, for both human and dolphin alike.",waterparks dolphins abandoned amusement parks abandoned

These gardens began in 1959 when Lex Graham planted an elephant’s ear bulb, which he fished out of the ocean on his morning swim, between the roots of a nearby coral tree. Much to his surprise, the bulb blossomed. Then he and his partner Ruby – who had only recently met – began to add other plants and cuttings to what would become these magnificent gardens. On these slopes, which were originally covered in logs, lantana, weeds, and rubbish, the couple planted whatever they could find that might grow in, and hold together, the soil: Tree ferns from the crevices in the rocks upon the foreshore; clivias and agapanthus discarded by local gardeners; and cuttings donated from the gardens of their friends. This labor of love that grew over the course of their courtship and marriage can be seen as a living memorial to the importance of community and volunteerism, and – most importantly, their love and the life they shared together.

Not anymore.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fruit-bats-of-yarra-bend-park,"In Melbourne, a Grey-headed flying fox (commonly known as a fruit bat) is not an uncommon thing to see. in fact, the Australian natives are a creature you can see frequently, but this does not make the sight of a colony of up to 30,000 any less astounding to behold. Roosting in numbers up to tens of thousands, these “megabats” swarm into mass colonies during the day, and then swoop out in waves as dusk settles to spend the night feeding on Eucalyptus pollen, assorted fruit, and nectars. There is arguably no better place to observe this mass exodus than on the embanks of the Yarra River in Yarra Bend Park. With an average wingspan of over three feet wide, these giant, adorable sky creatures are both loved and feared. Once considered a disease-infested menace to humans and a blight on orchards, the once abundant bats are now rising steadily up the list of creatures in a worrisome decline in desperate need of conservation. In just the last century, their numbers have gone from millions to less than 350,000, victims of lost habitats, climate extremes, and of course, humans. While the fear of the bats spreading viruses to humans was greatly exaggerated, there were three confirmed cases of the Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) being transmitted with deadly results. Despite the rarity, much attention has been given to public awareness, and the bats are not encouraged to roost anywhere near large populations of people. The massive colony at Yarra Bend Park have been around—they are the same group that once took up residence in Melbourne’s Royal Botanic Gardens. Relocating to the park in 2003, they seem a bit more wild in the open setting, and watching them fly out from a lookout point at the park’s Bellbird Picnic Reserve is a regular evening event for park-goers. Incidentally, the park is also a favorite roosting spot of another one of Australia’s problem children of the animal kingdom in need of conservation, the drunken lorakeets.

While some people have asserted that the giant rocks are fossilized eggs of the Rainbow Serpent, this belief is not widely held. Still, the entire area is of great spiritual significance to many in Australia. Beyond their significance, the Devils Marbles Conservation Area is much larger than most give it credit. Not comprised of only two marbles, the park actually spans 4500 acres of the dry outback, and houses hundreds of rounded rocks. Over millions of years, erosion of sandstone and exposure to the elements caused these granite rocks to take rounded edges, making many fields full of the marbles. Although many have retained a round shape, the process of solarization, or expanding and contracting in the desert’s temperature extremes, has caused some of the marbles to split completely in half. Some of the rocks are over 20 feet in diameter, while others are smaller than one foot. One of the biggest rocks was taken from the site and dedicated as a memorial to John Flynn, who founded a rural emergency service for the outback. However, since the Devils Marbles area is a sacred site, the move was met with great protest and the rock was returned to its natural habitat.",spheres geological oddities natural wonders geology nature
105,Undara Lava Tubes,"Mount Surprise, Australia",White cockroaches and other cave species occupy this massive series of lava tubes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/undara-lava-tubes,"The tubes’ story begins 190,000 years ago in Australia, where a young volcano named Undara was burbling up enormous volumes of molten lava onto the gently sloping plains of northern Queensland. It flowed at temperatures of 1,220° C across 1,550 square kilometers of land, creating the earth’s longest flow of lava from a single volcano. Researchers estimate that Undara’s geological cocktail spewed forth at about 1,000 cubic meters per second – enough to fill 1,500 semitrailer-sized tankers every minute. An estimated 23 billion cubic meters of lava flowed across the landscape, reshaping it into new geological forms as it cooled and hardened. Lava tubes form when the lava on the outside of a flow, exposed to air and earth, cools faster than the inside. As the still-molten rock inside flows out, it leaves tunnels and caverns in its wake. One such lava tube is over one hundred kilometers long. In the 190,000 years since they were formed, the lava tunnels have become home to diverse array of strange animal life. Vines and plant life have invaded through holes in tube ceiling, and all-white cockroaches and Scutigerids (think giant silverfish) skitter about beneath one’s feet. Thousands of specialized cave bats, snakes which eat the bats, frogs which emerge only once every few years during a very rainy season, and other bizarre life forms have all adapted to the long and often hidden lava tunnels. It is likely that there are many other endemic life forms living in the cave system. The longest tunnel, Bayliss, contains up to 200 times the ambient atmospheric level of carbon dioxide and is difficult to explore, creating the perfect environment for adaptable creatures to take hold. There was little interest in the caves until the 1970s when NASA began to explore them as potential models for the moon’s geology. Today they are visited by over thousands of people a year, and tours are offered daily. The Undara is 275 kilometres south west of Cairns.

In order to pay for the cost of providing for the criminals it housed, the site became a center of industry. Prison industries such as ship-building, shoe-making, metal-smithing, and brick-making flourished in this isolated location. The prison dockyards were actually forced to close down after private shipwrights complained to the government that they could not compete with the quality of ships made by the prisoners. Located on a remote peninsula, naturally protected on three sides by water, the prison was designed to primarily hold rough convicts who had re-offended since their transportation to Australia for other crimes. The concept of corporal punishment for crimes against society slowly gave way to new methods of “rehabilitation,” which may have actually been more cruel, including forced hard labor. Prisoners who did not survive were buried on the small island cemetery known as “The Isle of the Dead.” After the prison closed in 1877, despite the spooky surroundings, the area was redeveloped as a town, but fires in 1895 and 1897 left many of the original prison buildings gutted. A more recent blood-stained incident brought the historical site back into the headlines. On Sunday, April 28, 1996, in Australia’s worst killing spree, a man named Martin Bryant drove to the popular tourist spot and opened fire in the cafe, gift shop, and surrounding area, killing 35 people and wounding others. Bryant was caught and ultimately sentenced to 35 life sentences. He will die in prison, but many are still affected by the senseless massacre. The original cafe was burned to the ground, and a monument was erected in honor of those who died. Admission to the site includes an engaging interactive museum and access to most areas by foot. (There is a buggy that does the rounds and eliminates the need for too much walking.) Various options exist, including guided tours and trips to the islands, as well as a guided tour of the Isle of the Dead and the Point Puer Boys Prison. There is (of course) a souvenir shop, cafeteria, and restaurant. From Hobart, follow the A3 Tasman Highway (across the bridge) through Cambridge, across the bridge, right at Sorrell onto the A9 Arthur Highway, through Copping, through Eaglehawk Neck, and onto Port Arthur.",disaster areas crime and punishment ghost towns islands ruins
107,Mad Max 2 Museum,"Silverton, Australia",This shrine to film's most iconic wasteland wanderer is located in the very outback where the movies were shot.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mad-max-2-museum,"After one man’s obsession with the Road Warrior films led him to move to the Australian setting he had so long fantasized about, he went one step further and established the Mad Max 2 Museum, a lovingly crowded collection of real and handmade props and ephemera from the films. Open since 2010, the museum is the work of one Adrian Bennett who saw the films Mad Max and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and was instantly changed. After seeing the movies he became obsessed with finding out all he could about them, searching for props and other artifacts like a wastelander searches for gas. His obsession eventually led him to move to Silverton, Australia, one of the places where the films actually shot. It was here that he established his museum, putting his extensive Mad Max collection of display and outfitting his yard like a post-apocalyptic shack. The museum features an assortment of full-size costumes and props as well as an extensive collection of photographs and production stills, but the gems of the collection have to be the working replica cars, one of which was actually used as the Road Warrior’s car. The Interceptor-style cars can even be seen driving around Silverton from time to time. While there is not a working Thunderdome (likely because that did not come into play until the third film), with a reboot of the popular post-apocalyptic franchise in the works, Bennett’s Mad Max 2 Museum may be set to become a desert hot spot anyway.",film locations film museums and collections museums
108,Crabs of Christmas Island,"Christmas Island, Australia","The red crab exhibits one of the most spectacular migrations on earth, despite manmade obstacles.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crabs-christmas-island,"After the 1903 extinction of the predatory endemic species the Maclear’s Rat, the people of Australia’s Christmas Island found themselves in the path of millions of red crabs. Every year in the fall, Christmas Island is overcome by a scarlet wave of migrating crustaceans on a mad dash from the forest to the sea. For terrestrial crabs unique to this area, their little red crablings must be born in the ocean or they will not survive. As soon as the humidity is just right—around October or November—the crabs swarm over the island, across roads, through homes and schools, under every foot, every tire, inside unattended shoes and covering every surface available, all 100 million of them. The locals are very patient and protective of their sideways-scuttling neighbors and are careful to minimize driving, hang “Crabs Crossing” signs on the roads, and even construct ‘Crab Bridges’ to aid in their crossing. Once the masses reach the ocean and go about their business, they return to the forest, first the males, then the females, exhausted and spent, to wait for their offspring to return. A few weeks later, once the larval hatchlings have grown into their land legs, it’s time for them to make their journey across the island to their woodland home. At 100,000 hatchlings per female, the sheer number of teeny tiny crablets is hard to fathom as they wash back across the roads and buildings like a sea of scarlet spiders, swarming over everything in their path.  If you wish to see this massive crab migration, you may be running out of time. The accidental introduction of the aggressive and aptly named “yellow crazy ant” has recently begun to decimate the numbers of the red crabs at an alarming rate. The highly invasive insect has wreaked havoc on the ecology of the island, their excretion of formic acid poisoning the crabs as well as several other species unique to Christmas Island. Over a quarter of the red crab population has been wiped out so far, and the tenacious crabs now face ant-induced extinction.",animal islands islands natural wonders nature animals

Cave decorations, called speleotherms, developed over time, and these became viewable straws, cave coral, columns, flowstones, shawls and stalactites and stalagmites. Capricorn Caves are a premier nature-based attraction in central Queensland in the region around the city of Rockhampton, and its popular main subterranean complex leading to Cathedral Cave is wheelchair-accessible. The caves are amazing and tours range in length from a few hours to a few days. You can also get married in the beautiful Cathedral cave. Capricorn Caves is at 30 Olsen Caves Rd, The Caves, Queensland, and may be reached from Rockhampton heading north on the Bruce Highway, taking the turnoff to The Caves on Barmoya Rd and then on to Olsen Caves Rd.

110,Justice and Police Museum,"Sydney, Australia",This grim museum collects artifacts and evidence of some of the most sensational antipodean crimes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/justice-and-police-museum,"At the edge of one of Sydney’s most sun-drenched tourist hotspots, the ferry port of Circular Quay, a handsome yet unassuming building lures curious visitors away from busking circus refuse and the constant stream of didgeridoo techno to reveal the darker side of the city’s past. Past the spiked iron gates and through the sandstone-block archways lurk traces of Sydney and New South Wales’ seedy underbelly of crime, violence, and gangsters from the mid-nineteenth century onwards. Founded in 1991, the Justice and Police Museum is housed in the complex that served as Sydney’s Water Police Station and a magistrates court between 1856 and 1886, and retains its late-Victorian features, down to the foreboding police charge room and grim remand cells. If there are ghosts lurking within these walls, they are likely not the friendly variety. Certainly you will feel their eyes on you in the Rogues’ Gallery from the City of Shadows exhibition: black-and-white mug shots drawn in part from the mysterious “Special Photographs” section of the police archives of 1912-1930, in which many perpetrators and persons of interest can no longer be identified today. The exhibition reveals that the Australian mug shots from this period are distinctive in law enforcement of the era, with the subjects seemingly permitted to adopt a pose of their choice. For many of the small-time crooks and con artists pictured — some staring back at us with deranged, empty gazes as the cocaine and morphine craze took hold in the 1920s; some surprisingly insouciant or playing up to the camera with a touch of bravado; some looking really rather dapper — this could well have been the only time their photo was taken. The result is a haunting series of character portraits. The museum’s crime scene images are still more unsettling, whether a victim is pictured, the gory details exposed on a bloodstained rug, or some grimy interior sits eerily empty, unanswered questions hanging in the air. The criminals who are known to researchers and whose artifacts are on display range from notorious bushrangers of New South Wales – among them Captain Moonlite, a precursor to Ned Kelly – to bootleggers known as “sly groggers” to old-world urban crime lords. Most surprising are the women who dominated this sordid scene, none more ruthlessly than Kate Leigh (1881-1964). This stout, middle-aged lady was no seductive femme fatale, but became the most powerful “vice queen” of the 1920s and 30s with an empire of illegal liquor and stolen goods and a penchant for shocking violence, the members of her gang wielding cutthroat razors as standard issue (several of which are held at the museum). Other women encountered in these corridors committed heinous crimes on a domestic level. The sweet, neighbourly granny Caroline Grills laced her irresistible baked goods with rat poison before offering them to her family and friends; see the bottle of Thall-Rat in the display cabinet. In 1889, Louisa Collins (“The Borgia of Botany”) became the last woman to be hanged in New South Wales after poisoning two unsatisfactory husbands in succession; an execution hood sets this scene. Women crop up as victims, too, such as the “Pyjama Girl,” a young woman found burned up in a ditch in 1934 with nothing to identify her but her exotic yellow silk jammies. Then there is Linda Agostini’s death mask and the photos of her face with its gaping, bloody bullet-wound make for a chilling contrast with the serene expression of the blonde in the reconstructed police sketch. The zinc bath in which her body had been stored and publicly exhibited for identification purposes is also among the artifacts from this case. And who could forget the falsely convicted Lindy Chamberlain and her quintessentially Australian “a dingo ate my baby” defense? She crops up here too. Speaking of dogs, the museum has two behind glass. Tess, an Alsatian, was the first to perform official duties as part of the Police Dog Unit formed in 1932. She died after ten years of loyal service and was preserved by taxidermists at the Australian Museum before being transferred here. The second is a wimpy little Pekinese named Cherry, perhaps an inferior specimen but with no less impressive a story, playing a key role in the unraveling of Australia’s first child abduction and murder. In the Graeme Thorne case of 1960, hairs on the rug wrapped around the eight-year-old’s corpse were matched to Cherry’s tawny coat, helping to convict dog-owner Stephen Bradley, who had fled the country and abandoned his pet in a kennel. Cherry was hit by a car during the trial (an accident?) but NSW police sent his body to a taxidermist and admitted him as evidence. Good boy. Down the hall you will find an intimidating arsenal of pistols, daggers, and axes seized as evidence; imposing knuckledusters and maces confiscated, alarmingly, by the Railway Police. It’s hard to imagine someone waiting for the train at Redfern station with a homemade medieval mace in their coat pocket since the suburbs where notorious thugs and gangsters darkened every door are now some of Sydney’s trendiest.

111,Bungle Bungle Range,"Purnululu, Australia",These Australian rock formations look like Martian beehives that have grown up out of the landscape.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bungle-bungle-range,"Rising out of the landscape of the Purnululu National Park, the terrifically named Bungle Bungle Range are beehive-shaped rock formations that are thought to have been caused by the erosion of a very ancient meteorite crater. The gem of the Purnululu National Park in Western Australia, the geologic range is one of the most impressive stone formations on Earth, and maybe even Mars, which is where they seem to be from. Forming rounded cones and cylindrical towers, the rocks are made of porous conglomerate rock, the texture of which gives them their oft-remarked upon beehive look. The sediment that formed the rocks is thought to have been deposited 350-375 million years ago, slowly eroded from the wind and rains of the surrounding desert. The “Bungle Bungles,” as they are often called, also have a distinct orange-and-black-ringed pattern running all down their surface. This is caused not only by the conglomerate nature of their make-up but from water getting trapped in denser layers, allowing algae to grow and form the darker colorations. The rocks have long been an important site of the Jaru and Gidja peoples, who’ve lived in the region for between 20,000 and 40,000 years. The rocks were only “discovered” by outsiders in 1983 and they became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2003. Today, the rocks are still a fascinating feature, though their remoteness prevents them from being too overwhelmed with tourists.  Access to the park by road is via Spring Creek Track, from the Great Northern Highway approximately 250 km (160 mi) south of Kununurra, to the track's end at the visitor centre. The track is 53 km (33 mi) long and is usable only in the dry season (about 1 April to 31 December), and only by four-wheel-drive (4WD) vehicles.",rocks geological oddities geology

The mangroves are surrounded by parkland and a water bird refuge, where you can see variety of shorebirds, ducks, pelicans, and small songbirds. Several shipwrecks are also present a few meters off the shore from the refuge, including the SS Ayrfield. Before the 1990s, the mangroves were largely overlooked, as they were considered irrelevant. Industrial factories and chemical plants dumped pollution into the area, causing  lasting damage. Fortunately, recent research has led people to realize how important they are for the local marine ecosystem. There is an excellent elevated boardwalk system that’ll take you through the center of the mangroves, allowing you to experience the ecosystem without damaging the vegetation. The walkways are in excellent condition and would be accessible for both wheelchairs and strollers.

113,Museum of Underwater Art,"Townsville, Australia",A series of sculptures beneath the waves promote ocean conservation and support coral reefs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-underwater-art,"Not many museums literally take your breath away. But then Australia’s Museum of Underwater Art (MOUA) isn’t like most museums. The first—and only—underwater art museum in the Southern Hemisphere, the nonprofit MOUA is set off the coast of Queensland, 40 to 50 feet below the waves. The museum is actually spread across four locations, all accessible from the port city of Townsville (an area often overshadowed by more popular destinations nearby, such as Cairns or the Whitsundays). Its underwater sculpture installations were created to raise awareness of the issues facing the iconic Great Barrier Reef—including coral bleaching and warming water temperatures—and to boost tourism in the area. Designed by underwater sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor, with the support of the Queensland state government, the museum aims to challenge the way we think about ocean conservation, and to help create new areas for coral growth. All of these sculptures are anchored to the seabed—except for one. The MOUA’s first installation, unveiled when the museum opened in December 2019, is called “Ocean Siren.” Standing just off the Strand Jetty of Townsville, it’s made from stainless steel, translucent acrylic, and 202 LED lights. Hooked up to a temperature gauge on Davies Reef—part of the Great Barrier Reef—it changes color as a real-time response to the conditions in the water. As temperatures rise, visitors can watch the sculpture (modeled on a local student and Wulgurukaba descendant named Takoda Johnson) change from a calming blue to an alarming orange and red—a visible, tangible reminder of the dangers facing marine ecosystems. Scheduled to open in April 2020—but delayed till later in the year due to the global pandemic—the “Coral Greenhouse” on John Brewer Reef, some 45 miles from Townsville, contains 20 “reef guardian” sculptures. Placed in an underwater greenhouse that divers can enter and explore, and secured on a sandy base, the marine-grade concrete sculptures are covered by coral. The more covered they become, the thinking goes, the more marine life they’ll attract to the reef. More underwater art installations are scheduled to open off Magnetic Island and Palm Island in 2021.",underwater sculptures museums and collections museums
114,Macquarie Island,Australia,One of the only places where Earth’s mantle lies above water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/macquarie-island,"At roughly the midpoint between Antarctica and the island of Tasmania lies a small spit of land of understated significance. Though never permanently settled by humans, Macquarie Island has long served as an outpost for researchers and before that, sealers, seeking some of the island’s bountiful blubbery crop. Animal life aside, the island holds a more unique title in the annals of geology; it is among the only places on Earth where rocks from the mantle are exposed above sea level. Macquarie Island is the result of the same geologic processes as the Himalaya mountain range. When the Indian Plate (the tectonic plate on which the Indian subcontinent lies) smashed into the Asian supercontinent 50 million years ago, the immense resulting force created the Himalayas. By the same principle, Macquarie Island arose from an impact between the Indo-Australian and Pacific Plates. Though the result of their collision is on a smaller scale—Macquarie is only 1,345 feet at its highest point—the island is unique for exposing segments of oceanic crust and parts of the Earth’s mantle above water, giving researchers the means to study the stuff of the seafloor on dry land. Rock from more than three miles below the seafloor has been detected on the island, and provides information about the ocean crust in its natural environment. Macquarie Island was first discovered in modern times by Frederick Hasselborough, a sealer who promptly did his colonial duty by claiming the land for Britain, annexing it to New South Wales, and naming it for the colony’s governor. Upon arrival, Hasselborough found an ancient wreck, giving rise to speculation that Polynesian explorers had made the first landfall. The only living beings Hasselborough found were a massive colony of Royal penguins, albatross, and—to his sealing heart’s delight—hundreds of thousands of seals. The island’s biodiversity changed rapidly over the following decades, as classically human exploitation of wild fauna nearly eliminated native species. Meanwhile, introduced species both intentional (rabbits to feed the sealers) and unintentional (rats) ravaged the land and proliferated. In recent years, the Australian government has successfully led campaigns to reduce the number of invasive species, and to help restore the habitat and population of native ones. Despite the ebbs and swells, there are now a variety of populations. On the northernmost tip of the island lies a small encampment with a couple dozen structures, accessible only by sea. Macquarie Island’s unique geology—its ground truth—however remains virtually unchanged, resolute and isolated in the waters of the Pacific.  A number of companies offer travel to the island; they’re your best bet given how far afield the island is from Tasmania and New Zealand. Being located in the so-called ""Furious Fifties,"" named for the raging waters at that latitude, travel to the island by boat might best be done with dramamine in tow. Macquarie Island is cold, wet, and windy. Dress appropriately. As with all wildlife, the creatures of Macquarie island are minding their own business. Observe wildlife at a respectful distance, for your safety and that of the animals.",pacific wildlife geological oddities islands natural wonders geology nature
115,Dreamer's Gate,"Collector, Australia",One man's artistic vision is a small town government's legal battle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dreamers-gate,"Tony Phantastes had a vision. In the middle of a small Australian town, he was going to create an artistic wonderland to document the history of Australian land-use practices and to commemorate his father’s life and death. Phantastes began his sculpture called “Dreamers Gate” (and alternatively “Homage to My Father”, “Homage to the Dead Bushranger” and “Homage to the Landscape”) in 1993 on a six-acre property he owned in the small town of Collector, Australia. Phantastes father had been contracted each year to clear the land of vegetation, as well as the dry grass, and dead trees from this once fertile region. The sun-bleached landscape that resulted from his father’s work helped create the dramatic backdrop and inspiration for”Dreamers Gate” The sculpture itself is 24 meters long and 7 meters high, a sort of over-sized, mythical-looking fence leading to a gate looking out onto the prairie land. Made from wire, concrete, piping and covered with a skin of plaster, chicken wire, and a final layer of cement, it looks like a blend of gothic castle, Middle Earth, and the spider web of a giant arachnid. Despite this, Phantastes says it is not meant to be morbid, but a celebration of life. Unfortunately, the local government didn’t see it that way. A 1999 Gunning Shire Council citation began what would be a long and expensive legal battle for the artist. The work was deemed structurally unstable, the artist was fined, and a “stop work” order was issued. The piece has been scheduled for demolition for the last 10 years and remains unfinished. Nonetheless, the artist continues to fight for the sculpture. Ironically, while the artist and the city have been battling over its fate, the piece has started to rust and has indeed become structurally unstable. It remains to be seen whether “Dreamers Gate,” a project began more than a decade and a half ago, will ever get to be finished.

It’s the most popular attraction at the Enchanted Maze Garden, which operates several other mazes year-round. The Maize Maze, when completed, is the largest of its kind in the Southern hemisphere and takes up more than two and a half acres. It is created using GPS technology so that the final shapes, while only visible from the air, make up an elaborate design. The Maze is open from mid-February through late April. For those who can’t visit in that short timeframe, the Enchanted Maze Garden also maintains other mazes throughout the year: a traditional hedge maze with a Japanese Garden at its center, an ancient turf labyrinth, and a circular roomed maze for children. In addition, visitors enjoy the Blue Gum Gallery Maze, which allows participants to see the center from a bridge and proves that being able to see the entire maze doesn’t make it much easier to navigate. The Sculpture Park Walk is five acres of old growth eucalyptus filled with pieces made by a rotating artist in residence. Other features of the Enchanted Maze Garden include maintained topiaries, such as a Santa sleigh complete with reindeer, cacti gardens featuring ceramic creations, and a vegetable garden.

As the Pacific Ocean rushes into the ever widening sea cave beneath the Kiama Blowhole, the entry to the cave can become completely blocked which forces compressed air and water firing out through the blowhole. The impressive and violent natural display has been known of since the mid-1700’s when a whaler who had moored nearby discovered the spout, noting the deafening boom that accompanies each eruption. However, there is evidence that the local native peoples had already catalogued the wonder, naming it “Khanterintee.” Since the natural shower only occurs when the seas are swelled and fairly turbulent, visiting the site can be a dangerous venture for anyone who is not paying attention. In fact, in 1992 an entire family of seven was swept out to sea while visiting the blowhole when a huge swell crested the rocks and washed them away. Danger or no, the Kiama Blowhole is still a popular attraction in the town, and is often referred to the as the “Big Blowhole” thanks to a smaller, yet similar feature known, unsurprisingly as the “Little Blowhole.”",geological oddities natural wonders water geology nature

119,The Pitch Drop Experiment,"Brisbane, Australia","Started nearly 100 years ago, this science experiment just keeps on going, ever so slowly.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pitch-drop-experiment,"Begun in 1927 by Professor Thomas Parnell, this experiment was meant to reveal the surprising properties of an everyday material: pitch. Pitch is the name of a number of hard tar-like substances, and in this case, bitumen was used. Though at room temperature pitch appears to be a solid and can be shattered by a hammer, it is, in fact, a very high-viscosity liquid, and Professor Parnell wanted to prove it. Just getting ready to perform the experiment took years. First, the professor heated a sample of pitch and poured it into a sealed funnel… then he waited. For three years Parnell let the pitch settle in the funnel, until in 1930, when he felt that it was settled enough, he cut the bottom of the funnel, freeing the pitch to begin its mind-bogglingly slow downward escape. Professor Parnell lived long enough to record only two drips: the first in 1938, eight years after the opening of the funnel, and the second, nine years later in 1947. Parnell died in 1948, but the pitch experiment kept on going without him. As of 2014, the pitch has dripped only nine times. Ninety-one years after the experiment started, the tenth drop is only now forming. The pitch has now been calculated to be roughly 230 billion times more viscous than water. Curiously, because it only drips every eight to nine years, until 2014 no one had ever actually seen a drop fall. A webcam was set up in 2000, but due to technical problems, it missed the eighth drip. The ninth drip occurred on 24 April 2014 (during a beaker change), so the next pitch drop is estimated due in fourteen years. The webcam is currently set up, and one can try their luck—and patience—here. If the virtual experience isn’t enough, you can see it in person at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. Listed as the longest-running lab experiment by Guinness World Records, the pitch experiment not only outlived its creator, but will likely outlive us all. It has been estimated that there is enough pitch to keep it dripping, ever so slowly, for another hundred years.",laboratories physics world record instruments of science science
120,Coop's Shot Tower,"Melbourne, Australia",This historic Melbourne bullet factory is fully encased in a massive glass and steel cone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/coop-s-shot-tower,"Once the tallest building in all of early Melbourne, Coop’s Shot Tower was soon eclipsed by gargantuan skyscrapers and other modern urban behemoths, but rather than being torn down in the name of progress, a giant cone was built over the historic bullet factory to keep it safe. Originally built in 1888 the tall brick tower was used to create shot pellets. Such structures were not uncommon during the era as the process of creating the little lead balls involved letting droplets of molten metal fall the length of the tower into pools of water that would flash form them into their spherical shape. During its heyday, Coop’s tower could produce around six tons of shot a week. Luckily, the need for so much fire power dwindled over the years and the site diversified into other metal works. While the tower was never abandoned, the metal working at the site eventually ceased and the 164-foot tower became just a landmark. Rather than letting the old spire crumble, in 1991 a giant cone of black steel and glass was built over the tower, completely enclosing it. A museum regarding the history of both the tower itself and the history of Melbourne in general was opened inside the building. The museum has been kept remarkably well updated with new technologies such as gesture-controlled displays being installed in the historic tower.",industrial towers museums and collections museums

It is also home to a remarkable art installation in honor of its native culture. In 2003, as part of the Perth International Arts Festival, Turner Prize-winning British artist Sir Antony Gormley created 51 abstract sculptures and embedded them in the bed of the lake. The strange, skinny, metal figures dot the already otherworldly landscape over an area of four square miles. Titled Inside Australia, the installation was supposed to be removed after the Art Festival’s end, but it has proven so popular and such a draw for tourists, the figures have remained to this day. The lake is about 30 miles from the tiny town of Menzies (population 56) in Western Australia. Being an ephemeral lake, it only holds water periodically, and for thousands of years, it has been an important site to the Aboriginal people of Western Australia, who first inspired Gormley to create the work. Although closely associated with a local legend of the Seven Sisters (the constellation also known as the Pleiades), the lake’s English name is said to be based on a British miner and railway engineer named Robert Ballard who lived and worked in the region during the late 19th century. It was a time when mining and railroads were both central to the development of Australia, so while his name stuck, the original name of the lake seems to be lost to history.

In its history, the seam has covered a total area of 6.5 km, making it the oldest continuous coal fire in the world. Coal seams are extremely common across the world, and at any time there are more than 1000 burning. They happen frequently in lesser-developed mineral rich countries, but are often put out within a few days or at most a month. Considering the average duration of a coal seam fire, Mount Wingen’s fiery longevity has become something of a wonder across the globe and tourists have flocked to see the sulfur-tinged smoke emanating from the mountain. Although Mount Wingen has attracted tourists in droves, it has also caused massive ecological damage to the area’s vegetation. The path of the fire has left a barren and rocky trail, with no traces of life. Most assumed the fire was caused by volcanic activity, but it is now clear coal was ignited by a lightning strike or brush fire thousands of years earlier.

123,The Lillipad Cafe,"Sydney, Australia",An indigenous ethnobotanist runs this brunch spot celebrating Australia’s native flavors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lillipad-cafe-sydney,"The Lillipad Cafe’s signature gangurru burger is, like many burgers, topped with lettuce and served in a toasted bun. Take one bite, however, and you’ll realize there is something special about it. The patty sports hazelnut-bitter notes, thanks to the addition of indigenous Australian wattleseed. It’s topped with a juicy bush tomato relish and finger lime mayonnaise. The patty itself is made of kangaroo meat—called “gangurru” in the Guugu Yimithirr language. This brunch and lunch spot is owned by Nyoka Hrabinsky, an ethnobotanist from the indigenous Yidinji nation, and her husband Laszio. Hrabinsky learned to cook “bush tucker,” or native Australian food, by observing her elders as a child in an indigenous community in rural Queensland. As an adult, she worked as a park ranger, but felt that the role didn’t allow her to collaborate with the traditional owners of the land she worked on, many of whom had been forcibly displaced by European colonization. So she pivoted to ethnobotany, working with native peoples in Queensland to document and preserve their plant knowledge and heritage. And at the Lillipad Cafe, with its funky murals and inventive use of indigenous ingredients like cinnamon myrtle, wattleseed, Davidson plum, and macadamia nut, she brings bush tucker to urban Sydney in the form of burgers and breakfast treats.",indigenous restaurants
124,SS Maheno,"Fraser Island, Australia","WWI hospital ship lost in a cyclone turns up on the coast of Fraser Island, where she remains rusted and forgotten.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ss-maheno,"She was built for comfort, but when WWI broke out she went into service, her dining rooms converted into hospital wards, until a cyclone swept her away. Originally constructed and used as an ocean liner sailing back and forth across the Tasman Sea, the 5,000 ton steel-hulled SS Maheno was called into duty in 1915 to serve as a hospital ship transporting casualties back and forth between Sydney and Melbourne. She was eventually called to the UK and served the wounded soldiers in Europe, delivering them from France to England via the English Channel. At the end of the war, the SS Maheno headed home to New Zealand to resume carting perfectly healthy humans back and forth across the waters, and in July, 1935, she was sold to an Osaka shipbreaker. Unfortunately, she would never reach her new home, for there was a storm brewing. About 50 miles out from the coast, a severe cyclone whipped itself around the Maheno and the ship towing her, the 1,756-ton Oonah. The towline was severed, and the crews were unable to reattach it as the ships heaved about in the choppy waters. The Maheno and the eight men aboard drifted away into the dark waters, as the helpless crew aboard the crippled Oonah could do nothing but watch. After three hand-wringing days, the ship and her camped-out crew were found beached on the shore of Fraser Island. Attempts to re-float the liner proved to be futile, and the SS Maheno, the luxury liner that served so many wounded troops, was stripped and abandoned. The rusty remains of the ship are still visible, but the site is extremely unsafe and is prohibited to visitors.",disaster areas shipwrecks water
125,Crocodile Harry's Underground Nest & Dugout,"Coober Pedy, Australia",This eccentric cave dwelling is bizarre even by the standards of a subterranean town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crocodile-harry-s-underground-nest-dugout,"In an entire town where the homes, businesses, and all other structures are dug right out of the ground it takes a site as insane as Crocodile Harry’s Underground Nest & Dugout to stand out with its cacophonous collection of bones, primitive art, and messages from visitors. Located in the self-described opal mining capital of the world, Coober Pedy, where all of the structures are built into the cliff-sides and ground due to the intolerable heat in the region, Captain Harry’s former home is unmistakable. The titular captain was actually a crocodile hunter during his life before settling down in Coober Pedy. A notorious personality in the town, Harry was well known for both his insane home and for his love of women. Unfortunately, the iconoclastic rake died in 2006, in the end claiming that he was, in fact, a Latvian baron who had been in hiding since World War II. Luckily Captain Harry’s home remains and has been turned into an attraction for curious visitors to the remote town. The walls of his dugout are covered in all manner of recovered knick-knacks and tribal graffiti, some placed by visitors, but most installed by Harry himself. Many who have visited the house have left their own messages on the rounded walls and ceilings and many of the women who visited while Harry lived say that he would request a little ribald contact for the honor. Crocodile Harry’s Nest & Dugout is one of the most visited places in Coober Pedy but will likely be remembered for its use as a set in such movies as Pitch Black and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.",subterranean film locations film eccentric homes subterranean sites homes
126,Old Melbourne Gaol,"Melbourne, Australia",Once housing children next to hardened criminals this historic jail once displayed Ned Kelly's skull until it was stolen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-melbourne-gaol,"Built in 1839, the Old Melbourne Gaol once loomed over the city, taking in any and all comers from lazy children to murderous vigilantes. This historic prison was the site of over 100 hangings including that of famed criminal Ned Kelly, whose death mask, along with those of others hanged at the site, still sits in the museum that now inhabits the space. At the time of its construction, Melbourne Gaol was an imposing symbol of the city’s unforgiving justice system, reminding all just where they would end up should they break the law. As the only penal fortress in the area, the jail became the holding house for everyone from mentally ill lunatics to serial killers to unruly young children. The youngest reported inmate was a three-year-old who was held in the jail for six months for the offense of being idle. Executions were also commonplace in the jail with 133 hangings taking place at the jail during its 90 years in operation. The prison even put to death some of the era’s and area’s most infamous criminals such as Frederick Bailey Deeming, who was convicted of murdering a couple of his wives and a handful of his children, and most notoriously, murderer-or-vigilante-depending-on-who-you-ask Ned Kelly. He of the iconic home-made plate metal armor was captured after a deadly confrontation with police, and hanged in the Melbourne jail in 1880. The jail ceased operation in 1929 when the conditions were no longer deemed acceptable. Some of the structures were taken down, but the remaining facilities were once again used to house AWOL soldiers during World War II before finally being established as a museum in 1957. The museum told the history of the famous jail and displayed such grim mementos as the death masks of some of those executed at the site and even a skull reported to belong to Ned Kelly. Unfortunately, the skull was stolen in the ’70s. Today the museum is still open and has added such attractions as a mock trial for Ned Kelly in which the whole family can reenact sentencing the man to death. And while his skull no longer graces the halls of the Old Melbourne Gaol, Kelly’s death mask remains for anyone who wants to stare into the eyes of a dead criminal.",death masks jails prisons museums and collections museums

-James Cook, June 3, 1769 at Venus Point, Tahiti Getting to Tahiti from England in 1769 to observe the century’s second transit of Venus was no small undertaking, and James Cook and his companion astronomers took their obligation to observe and record the passage of the second planet as it partially eclipsed the sun very seriously. In fact, history and the English Navy had much grander plans for Cook and his crew to “search between Tahiti and New Zealand for a Continent or Land of great extent.” They did not return to England until July 11, 1771 Scientists and observers from several countries were dispatched to view and document the 1769 transit of Venus from stations around the world in an attempt to accurately measure the distance of the sun from the Earth. The transit of Venus is a rare occurrence, happening in patterns repeating every 243 years. There had been a transit in 1761, but another would not occur until 1874, so this was their generation’s last chance for observations. Tahiti had only recently been “discovered” by Englishman Samuel Wallis in 1767, and his visit was rapidly followed by glowing accounts by the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who described the island’s beauty and the native’s natural charms with considerable poetry. The English government saw it as an ideal location to launch an exploration of the the south seas, in search of the fabled southern continent, as yet undiscovered. Cook arrived on Tahiti in April 1769, and promptly established Fort Venus on the northeast end of Matavai Bay, which he determined ideal for his assigned astronomical observations. On June 3, 1769, the weather turned out to be favorable, and Cook and his companions dutifully recorded their observations. As it turns out, Cook’s observations were flawed - yet still remarkably accurate considering the available technology. Following the transit, Cook and his crew departed Tahiti for their epic circumnavigation of the southern hemisphere, becoming the second European visitors to New Zealand and the first to record a discovery of Australia. Today Point Venus is home to a picturesque Victorian-era lighthouse and a monument to the crew of the Bounty, who also landed at Venus Point. Currently, there are no monuments to Cook, or markers related to the fort or the 1679 astronomical observations. The most recent transits of Venus were in 2004, and on June 5, 2012. The next transit will be in 2117. The picture is not of Pt Venus, but Arue where I live.",dead explorers long now locations
131,Teti'aroa Atoll,French Polynesia,This beautiful eden was once the vacation home of Tahitian royals before Marlon Brando bought it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tetiaroa-atoll,"The stunning Teti’aroa Atoll off the coast of Tahiti has long been admired for its tropical beauty, but it didn’t really become famous until actor Marlon Brando bought the whole damn thing as a personal vacation spot. Consisting of around 12 little islets covered in sandy beaches and tropical greenery, the atoll was once used as a vacation spot for the Pōmare royal family of Tahiti. They would use the island for rest and relaxation, and even sometimes, to hide treasure. Eventually the islets were given over to the only dentist in Tahiti, who passed the lands down among his family. Brando stumbled upon the islands while scouting a movie location, and decided that it would be his. He purchased the atoll from the dentist’s descendants and made it his own personal get away. He spent as much time there as he could afford, even if the Tahitian people weren’t exactly ecstatic about his Hollywood takeover of their islands. Brando even built a small hotel on one of the larger islands. Today there are plans to build an even larger resort complex on the atoll, called The Brando. But it is not all luxury vacations. At least one researcher is using the islands, introducing sterile mosquitoes as a preventative abatement procedure. Maybe in a few years, Teti’aroa Atoll will be known more for curing disease than for curing Brando’s boredom.",mosquitoes celebrity islands
132,Cactus Dome,Marshall Islands,An enormous concrete structure built over a nuclear crater.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cactus-dome,"Between 1946 and 1962, the U.S. military conducted 105 atmospheric nuclear tests over the “Pacific Proving Grounds,” a euphemism for the Marshall Islands and several other nearby South Pacific atolls. In the late 1970s, in an effort to clean up the radioactive debris left by those explosions, the government dug up 111,000 cubic yards of soil from the Bikini and Rongelap atolls and deposited it on Runit Island. Its resting place would be in a 350-foot wide crater that had been created two decades earlier by an 18-kiloton nuclear test code-named Cactus. Covering up that giant radioactive pit cost the government nearly a quarter of a billion dollars and took three years to complete. The result: an enormous, foot-and-a-half-thick, 100,000-square-foot dome consisting of 358 gigantic concrete panels. Despite signs warning off visitors, it is still possible to make landfall on Runit and stomp across the Cactus Dome.

133,Bikini Atoll,Marshall Islands,"The birthplace of both the Atomic Age and Godzilla, and the namesake of the bathing suit.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bikini-atoll,"Bikini Atoll is a Micronesian Island chain located about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, and is what should be a heavenly place on Earth. However, its residents were forcibly relocated when the United States took possession of the islands in 1946, and over the next 12 years, the country sent 23 nuclear bombs raining down on this slice of paradise. From the air, Bikini is pristine and beautiful. The plant life has regrown unchecked since the explosions and is lush and green. Some visible remains of houses, towns, and graveyards give the illusion that civilization still exists on the land, in addition to a small research station maintained by the Department of Energy. The coral reefs have also been reborn and the large lagoon is inviting and clear. During the first practical test of a hydrogen bomb at Bikini, 23 members of a Japanese fishing boat crew that were supposedly at a safe distance were contaminated by the blast, and the scandal that rocked the nation was epic. It eventually became the inspiration for the movie Godzilla, in which a radioactive monster rises from an American nuclear test and attacks Japan. In 1968, the US prematurely deemed the islands safe, and let residents return to their homes. But contamination levels remained dangerous, and they had to be removed yet again. Under the clear lagoon, are the remains of nearly a dozen ships sunk during Operation Crossroads in 1946, and it’s possible and safe—though quite expensive—to visit and dive on the wrecks, including an aircraft carrier, a battleship. and more.

135,Nan Madol Ruins,Micronesia,The ruins of a South Pacific island city are spectacular and strange enough to have inspired H.P. Lovecraft.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nan-madol,"Off the coast of a remote Micronesian island lay the ruins of a once-great city of man-made stone islands that represent the remains of megalithic architecture on an unparalleled scale in Micronesia—and inspired the city of R’lyeh in H. P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos. Evidence of the earliest human activity dates back to the first or second century BC. The construction of artificial islets started probably about 8th and 9th century AD. However, the megalithic structures were built in period of 12th to 13th century, about the same time as the stone construction of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, or Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The complex of Nan Madol is constructed on a series of artificial islets in the shallow water next to the eastern shore of the Pohnpei island. The site encloses an area approximately 1.5 km long by 0.5 km wide and it contains nearly 100 artificial islets. Nan Madol seems to have housed the ruling elite caste of Saudeleur dynasty. It was a political and ceremonial seat of power. As a means of control of their subjects Saudeleur dynasty had succeeded in uniting the clans of Pohnpei. The rulers forced local chieftains to leave their home villages and move to the city where their activities could be more closely observed. Most of the islets served as residential area, however some of them served special purpose, such as food preparation, coconut oil production or canoe construction. Madol Powe, the mortuary sector, contains 58 islets in the northeastern area of Nan Madol. The centerpiece of the whole complex is the royal mortuary at the islet of Nandauwas, with its 7.5m high walls surrounding the central tomb enclosure. The population of Nan Madol was probably more than 1000 at a time when whole population of Pohnpei barely reached 25,000. There are no sources of fresh water or possibilities to grow food on Nan Madol so all supplies had to be brought in from the mainland. The population of the city probably included a large number of commoner servants. Nan Madol is the biggest center of the culture which left numerous other megalithic structures scattered on neighboring shores and on main island of Pohnpei; it all can be found in the area of about 18 square kilometers. According to local legend, the stones used in the construction of Nan Madol have been flown to the location by means of black magic. Archeologists have located several possible quarry sites on the main island, however the exact method of transportation of construction material is still not determined. Lovecraft used the story of the ruins as the basis for his R’lyeh, a fictional sunken city and home to Cthulhu, appearing in the short story “Call of Cthulhu”: “The nightmare corpse-city of R’lyeh … was built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults … until the end.” The real island of Pohnpei is also mentioned in the story. Nan Madol had been abandoned by the time the first Europeans arrived, early in the 19th century, most likely declining at the time of the fall of the Saudeleur Dynasty in about 1450. Some have claimed that the ruins are the lost islands of Lemuria, although there is no scientific backing for this claim (or, for that matter, for the existence of Lemuria at all).  United Airlines offers an island-hopper flight to Pohnpei, which goes east to west on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and west to east on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.",h. p. lovecraft lost cities horror monsters ancient islands ruins
136,Ghost Fleet of Truk Lagoon,Micronesia,Tropical paradise strewn with hundreds of World War II wrecks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ghost-fleet-of-truk-lagoon,"For two days in 1944, Allied bombers rained destruction on the beaches of the Caroline Islands in the South Pacific. During World War II, the lagoon was host to Japan’s Imperial Fleet, which was left destroyed in the wake of Operation Hailstone, often referred to as Japan’s Pearl Harbor. Today, hundreds of Japanese aircraft and other military machines remain at the bottom of the lagoon, making it one of the world’s best World War II wreck dive sites. The islands were once part of the Spanish West Indies, explored by Magellan and later visited by Spanish merchants and missionaries. The low coral islands are surrounded by a remarkable, sheltered reef—ideal for housing a navy. On February 17, 1944, five fleet carriers and four light carriers, along with support ships and some 500 aircraft, descended on the islands in a surprise attack. Just a week before the attack, the Japanese military had moved additional ships to the area, and, as a result, approximately 250 Japanese aircraft were destroyed and more than 50 ships sunk. An estimated 400 Japanese soldiers were killed in one ship alone, trapped in the cargo hold. Most of the fleet remains in exactly the same spot it was left, largely forgotten by the world until the late 1960s. Jacques Cousteau’s 1969 film Lagoon of Lost Ships explored the wreck-littered lagoon, and many of the sunken ships were then still full of bodies. As wreck divers brought attention to the site, Japan began recovery efforts, and many bodies have been removed and returned to Japan for burial. A few, however, remain. Many of the wrecks are visible through the shallow, clear water, making it an accessible dive. The wrecks themselves can be very dangerous, not only because of ragged edges and tangles of cables but because of half-century old oil and fuel leaking into the water, creating a potentially dangerous situation. Up until the 1990s, the lagoon was known at Truk, but it is now called Chuuk. Many maps still show both names.",ship graveyards airplane graveyard shipwrecks ships water ruins
