0,Palmyra,"Palmyra, Syria",Mysterious lost empire of the Silk Road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palmyra,"Led by Queen Zenobia, a third-century ruler who was later taken to Rome and paraded through the streets in golden chains, Palmyra was a rich city on the Silk Road, a gateway to the West for travelers returning from the Orient. Under Zenobia’s rule, Palmyra actually took territory from the Romans–and the short-lived Palmyrene Empire stretched from Turkey down to Egypt. The empire lasted for thirteen years, and then Aurelian decided to take it back. He defeated the Palmyrenes and took Zenobia back to Rome, where she was accepted into society and eventually became a lively and much-admired Roman matron. In 1980, it was declared a UNESCO world heritage site. For most of the past few years, Palmyra was a small town with a large and lush oasis next to it; the ruins of the old city covered the plain for a good square mile. Beautiful Romanesque columns carved from the local golden sandstone marched down long avenues; in the early morning and early evening, the brilliantly blue sky contrasted strikingly with the warm tones of the stone and the long, deep shadows. It was an extraordinary place to visit, a reminder of a mysterious lost empire, worthy of pulp novels. Unfortunately, in May of 2015 the area fell under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Daesh), and its temples, monuments, and other buildings were subsequently blown up, razed, or otherwise destroyed. How much of it will remain after the conflict remains unknown. Inaccessible due to the ongoing Syrian Civil War",lost tribes ruins
1,Krak des Chevaliers,"Safita, Syria",Ruins of the Crusaders' headquarters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/krack-des-chevaliers,"Krak des Chevaliers is the single most imposing symbol of the Crusades. The Krak is a massive Crusader fortress built during the First Crusade on a strategically important spot 40 kilometers from city of Homs or Hims, called l’Chamelle by the Crusaders, in the middle of the Syrian desert. What made this spot so strategic was that only one route led from the city of Antioch south to Beirut and the Mediterranean, and that route passed through Homs Gap. Krak des Chevaliers sits atop the 650-meter hill which dominates the surrounding countryside and overlooks this ancient highway. The Krak was originally a much smaller fortress, built by the Emir of Aleppo. In 1110, it was captured by Tancred, Prince of Galilee and one of the most famous Crusaders; the fortress later passed into the possession of Knights Hospitaller, the most powerful religious-military orders of the Crusades. The greatly expanded fortress served as their base of operations in the Middle East for centuries. Built according to the taste of its masters, Krak des Chevaliers is a typical example of Gothic architecture, uprooted from Western Europe and transferred to the Middle East. Even today, it is one of the best-preserved examples of European medieval military architecture. The fortress could accommodate a garrison of 2000 soldiers. The inner protective wall is over 3 meters thick. The inner castle is protected by seven towers, each 10 meters in diameter. The storeroom is 120 meters long and could hold supplies that would permit the defenders to survive a siege for about five years, with stables that could accommodate up to one thousand horses. Krak des Chevaliers withstood numerous attacks by Muslim forces, even a siege by the mighty Saladin in 1188. Legend has it that Saladin managed to capture the commander of the fortress and ordered him to make the defenders open the gates. Allegedly he did as he asked, speaking in Arabic, but then commanded in French that his men defend the castle to the last warrior. In the end, sheer force-of-arms was not enough to conquer these mighty walls. The castle fell to a cunning trick. In 1271, Baibars Mamluk, Sultan of Egypt, managed to take the fortress after sending a forged letter to the defenders in the name of their master and commander in Tripoli ordering them to surrender the castle. After their expulsion from Syria and Levant, the never-conquered (though easily duped) Knights Hospitaller moved their headquarters to Cyprus and then to Rhodes, retreating ever westwards, until they settled on Malta, where they survived until Napoleonic times as the Knights of St. John. Today, the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes, and of Malta has its headquarters in Rome. Although not territorial, the Order has a diplomatic status in many ways equal to that of a sovereign nation. It maintains diplomatic relations with many nations and issues its own own passports, currency, stamps, and even vehicle registration plates. Thankfully, the Order has reverted back to its humanitarian roots. Krak des Chevaliers is on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.  Buses from Homs, or minibus for Hama costs about 1$.

2,Dead City of Serjilla,"Balshoon, Syria","A 1,500-year-old ghost settlement is slowly fading away.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/serjilla,"There were no dramatic events causing a mass exodus from Serjilla. No catastrophe befell the small farming town, and no earth-shattering natural disaster struck. There was a smattering of invasion and disease, but mostly, Serjilla simply melted away into the landscape, forgotten yet preserved in time. Known as the Dead Cities of Syria, a series of 800 small villages from the 5th century are remarkably preserved and give the world clues to life in a small Byzantine farming community. Serjilla is only 50 miles Southwest of Aleppo, and is one of the best kept of the Dead Cities. Founded in 473 C.E, Serjilla was a small but prosperous agrarian town. Like all the villages in the area, Serjilla produced olives, olive oil, grapes, wine and wheat. Fruitful trade routes ran through the area and the people lived a modest Christian life with little luxury or grand monument. Archeologists who have studied the area have pointed to this modesty as a defining characteristic of the city, and have viewed the town as an average farming town from 1500 years ago. In the 7th century, as the Umayyad dynasty began to gain power, trade routes shifted out of the area and the Dead Cities were slowly abandoned. There were some attacks during the time from Arab invaders. However, the migration from Serjilla and its neighbors was mainly based around economic concerns. Today, the ruins feature many structures of the ancient town, including a Christian church, two-story villa and a small building with an olive press. Although the city was not abandoned in chaos, the many have remarked on the eerie setting around Serjilla and the absolutely barren landscape that surrounds it.

3,Musyaf Castle,"Masyaf, Syria",The Syrian headquarters of alleged hashish-smoking assassins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-of-musyaf,"The tale of the Hashshashin is well-known legend in the West. Basically it can be summed up as: they smoked hash, and they killed people. The name “Hashshashin” became synonymous with skillful murder and is the basis for the modern term assassin. While modern scholars suspect that the hash smoking part probably isn’t true – the name Hashshashin was probably an insult based on their true name, the Asasiyun or “foundation of the faith” – what everyone can agree on is that they definitely killed people. Many people and very skillfully. They did much of this killing from the Musyaf Castle. Situated on a 20 meter plateau the Musyaf castle imposes itself on the hilly landscape of Syria. The structure dates back over 2800 years to the Byzantine era and saw rule by Mamluks and Ottomans, but is remembered today by its darkest period. It’s towers and gates still stand as symbols of the violent force that was contained within its walls: home to the Hashshashin. During the 12th century, the Hashshashin cult was led by Rashid al-Din Sinan, also known as “the Prince of the Mountain.” A trained Hashshashin himself and a powerful Northern Syrian warlord, Rashid controlled and ruled over the trained killers. While Sinan held the fortress, he carried out numerous attacks on leaders around the region including the King of Jerusalem as well as against his mortal enemy Saladin the leader of the Ayyubids. In an attempt to kill Sinan, Saladin laid siege to Masyaf, nearly taking the castle. According to legend, (and in the writing of the sect itself) while Saladin slept in a tent beneath Masyaf, an assassin crept into his tent, leaving and a poisoned cake a note saying “You are in our power. ” Never has a cake been so terrifying. Scared to death, Saladin made peace with Sinan and left him in control of Masyaf. The assassins sect in Musyaf came to an end when they met an enemy as fearsome as themselves: the mongols. Today, the ruins can be visited from Hama only 60 kilometers to the East, for adventurers who dare cross into Assassin territory.

5,Church of Saint Simeon the Stylite,Syria,"What is left of the pillar of Saint Simeon, the voluntary martyr who climbed the column to give his sermons, remaining perched there for thirty-seven years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-saint-simeon-stylite,"In the early fifth century, a Syrian monk named Simeon wandered out into the desert where he found, near modern-day Aleppo, an abandoned column rising up out of the sand. Simeon climbed the pillar, and would remain aloft on it for the next thirty-seven years (though he did eventually transfer to a much taller pillar nearby). From the pillar, he preached sermons to those who sought out his wisdom and his example, though history has not treated his vocation well. Edward Gibbon wrote of Simeon, “This voluntary martyrdom must have gradually destroyed the sensibility both of the mind and the body, nor can it be presumed that the fanatics who torment themselves are susceptible of any lively affection for the rest of mankind.” His odd life later became the subject of a scathing satire by Luis Buñuel, Simon of the Desert. He was not the only pole sitter (known as a “stylite”) but he was the first and the most famous, and after his death this church was built on the site of his pillar to honor his ascetic devotion. The church was huge, over 5000 square meters, rivaling Hagia Sofia in size, though it has long since fallen into ruin and now comprises only part of the large complex of ruins known as the Dead Cities of Syria. Saint Simeon’s pillar, surprisingly, still stands, though it’s been whittled down to just a few meters from centuries of relic seekers who’ve carved off small shards for themselves. located about 30 km (19 mi) northwest of Aleppo",relics and reliquaries sacred spaces ruins architectural oddities architecture
6,Souk al-Saqatiya,"Aleppo, Syria","Amid the rubble of Aleppo's Old Quarter, part of a historic market has been restored and re-opened.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/souk-al-saqatiya,"Before it became a 21st-century battleground, Aleppo’s historic Old Quarter embraced the world’s longest and oldest network of souks—Arabic for covered markets. There were 45 in all, dating back to medieval times and forming a 13-kilometer labyrinth where Syrians and foreigners came to shop, work, and socialize. Between 2012 and 2016, government and rebel forces fought for control of Aleppo, which was then Syria’s biggest city. By the time government troops regained control of the Old Quarter, almost all the souks and all but a hundred of their 1,600 shops had been damaged or destroyed—demolished by explosives, pitted by shrapnel, and charred by fire. Syrian authorities and foreign heritage organizations aim to bring the Old Quarter back to life by rebuilding the souk network bit by bit. One of the first sections to be restored is the Saqatiya souk, a 100-meter cobblestone alley containing 53 shops. Saqatiya means a seller of meat offcuts, and under the souk’s arched roof, vendors once again shout their wares, including fresh meat, nuts, sweets, clothing, and toiletries. Al-Saqatiya, sometimes spelled al Saqatiyah, re-opened in 2019 and is a short stroll from the 11th-century Great Mosque, Aleppo’s war-damaged spiritual heart. Reconstruction of the souk cost $400,000 and took about eight months, the Associated Press reported. The project employed about 60 workers and was funded and supervised by the Geneva-based Aga Khan Trust for Culture, which promotes the restoration of historic sites as a catalyst for social and economic development. Syrian architect Bassel al-Daher said about 30 percent of Saqatiya was damaged in the war. He told AFP that its reconstruction was “the project of a lifetime.” Aleppo’s location, midway between the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Euphrates River to the east, put it at the center of international trade for millennia. Long-distance caravan trains brought Persian silks, Indian pepper, and other valuable cargoes to the city. Products found their way west by way of European merchants who lived in Aleppo from at least the 16th century. They tapped into a multi-ethnic and multi-faith commercial network that stretched as far as China.  We currently recommend against travel to Syria. The U.S. State Department has issued a ""Do Not Travel"" advisory for the entire country, citing ongoing risks such as ""terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Few international hotels are operating in Aleppo, and power rationing is in effect. The badly damaged Old Quarter is in the early stages of reconstruction, and largely deserted.",markets meat shops
7,Deir Mar Musa al-Habashi,"An-Nabk District, Syria",This ancient mountain monastery welcomes all manner of faith in an effort to keep Christians in Syria.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/deir-mar-musa-al-habashi,"This ancient Catholic monastery houses world renowned wall frescos and promotes religious acceptance in a region ravaged by intolerance and war. The structure of Deir Mar Musa (The Monastery of St. Moses The Abyssinian) has had many incarnations since it was first built by the Romans in Byzantine times. Originally intended for use as a Roman watchtower to monitor and control illicit trade, it was repurposed as a medieval hermitage site, a Catholic monastery, and eventually it was left abandoned for several centuries until it was reclaimed in 1991 by a local Syrian-Catholic monastic community. The modern-day Catholic community is founded on the premise of religious tolerance. It works to convince local Christians to remain in Syria and to work with their Muslim neighbors to build a multi-religious community. It also embraces a wider audience, and any wandering traveler is welcome to enter the monastery and stay the night, so long as they participate in community chores and respect the monastery rules. While camouflaged among the burnt brown stone of the towering valley walls, the site itself remains an imposing edifice. The monastery is built high onto the mountains rimming the valley, and it takes 30 minutes of walking up a path of narrowly stacked stairs to reach the entrance gate. Each step creates a sensation of walking back in time, with only a single cable cord (used to transport food goods from the valley floor) marring an image that has remained largely unchanged in the last thousand years. However, the medieval ambiance is misleading, for inside the ancient stone walls is a community that has seamlessly woven both modernity and tradition into their lifestyle. Electric lights are turned on following the daily hour of silence, and the ancient rugs outside the chapel are piled with a mix of Nike athletic shoes and leather sandals. Inside the chapel, the Monastery’s leader preaches in a room decorated with 800-year old frescos of Christ, but uses translators to reach out to a modern congregation of international travelers on their iPhones. Deir Mar Musa is a beacon of hope in a war-torn country, and offers an inspiring layover for travelers who wish to better understand and appreciate the nuances of Syrian culture.",monks churches sacred spaces
8,Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque,"Set Zaynab, Syria",This ornate mosque is said to hold the remains of Muhammad's granddaughter beneath its dome of pure gold.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sayyidah-zaynab-mosque,"This exquisite blue-tiled Damascus mosque houses the remains of Sayyidah Zaynab in a shrine adorned with crystal. It is a vitally important pilgrimage site for Shia Muslims who come to pay mournful respect to her remains. The Shrine of Lady Zaynab was built to honor the granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammad, and is believed by some to contain her remains. In 680 BCE, Lady Zaynab was captured and taken prisoner following the massacre at Karbala, one of the defining tragedies of the Shia religious tradition. While captive, she saved the life of her nephew, Ali, by throwing herself over his body and declaring they would have to kill her as well. Her bravery preserved the line of succession, ensuring the future of Shiism. As such, her shrine is one of the most important and emotional pilgrimage sites for Shia Muslims. The shrine itself is hidden in a maze of shops, hotels, and restaurants in southeast Damascus. Finding the mosque is a challenge that requires following crowds of black-robed Iranian pilgrims and the occasional glimpse of the towering blue minaret. The entrance gate opens onto a polished outer courtyard that is dominated by the shrine at its center and the entire edifice is adorned with intricate blue-tiled mosaics of symbolic flowers, geometric shapes, and Arabic script. The dome atop the shrine is made of pure gold, as are the ceremonial doors. The courtyard is filled with grief-ridden men and women marching in circles, chanting prayers in Farsi and Arabic. The shrine itself is a small, but exquisite display of mirrors, crystal, and gold ornamentation. However, it is not the beautiful decoration that immediately captures a visitor’s attention. The atmosphere inside is one of open emotion rather than silent reverence. It is filled with the wailing cries and profuse tears of pilgrims who have come to pay respect to Lady Zaynab’s remains. Women tear at their clothes, beat their chests, and collapse to the ground. It is a display of passionate mourning, and the pilgrims mourn her death as they would a beloved daughter. A visit to the Shrine of Lady Zaynab will leave visitors of any faith overwhelmed, both by the beautiful architecture and the moving power of belief.",mosques shrines architecture
9,Norias of Hama,"Hama, Syria",Only a handful of these gorgeous historic waterwheels remain but even those are in danger from local unrest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/norias-of-hama,"The Norias of the Syrian city of Hama are a collection of historic waterwheels so lovely and elaborate that they make classical Western waterwheels look weak in comparison. Unfortunately, after surviving for hundreds of years, these lovely wooden constructions are in danger of becoming victims of local conflicts. Evidence of these ornate water wheels dates back as far as the 5th century CE, although none of the extant examples have been found to be quite so ancient. The norias (“wheels of pots” in Arabic) were originally constructed on the Orontes River to move H2O through a series of aqueducts that fed farms all across the settlement, becoming so iconic that they eventually became the symbol of the city. Even after they fell out of general use with the advent of modern irrigation systems, the norias were left intact, aging into beautiful historic icons of the city’s agrarian past. By the modern day there were 17 of the historic wheels still standing across the city, some attached to old buildings, others just standing free as the city changed around them. The iconic relics were even to be considered protected UNESCO artifacts, but unfortunately this designation has yet to be approved. Sadly, it may be too late in any event. Recent reports from the war-torn region suggest that some, if not all of the norias may have been burnt down. For history’s sake let’s hope that these reports are greatly exaggerated.

The newly paved road leading to his tomb is lined with black lamp posts and lofty trees, and except for the occasional motorcycle or service bus, there is an eerie silence in the vicinity of the tomb. If it weren’t for Assad’s patronage throughout his 30-year tenure, the town of Qardaha would be just another sleepy, mountain town dominated by Syria’s privileged Alawi sect. Today, Qardaha is still tranquil and isolated, but is home to the tombs of the Assad family, including Hafez’s mother Na’asa and his son Basil, who died at the age of 32 in a 1994 car crash. Hafez and Basil are both entombed in a white-roofed mausoleum adorned with Quranic texts that overlooks a lush valley. Their coffins are sunken into the tomb’s marble floor, with black-clad guards pacing and keeping watch. Outside of the tomb, there is an open shed that houses flowers and devotional plaques brought by mourners. Just down the road at Na’asa Assad’s tomb, an aqua green-domed mosque awaits. The inner courtyard fountain is flanked by separate rooms for prayer, but the centerpiece of the tomb is a painted portrait of Hafez bowing with respect to a hagiographic depiction of Na’asa.

The external grounds of the museum feature Russian-built tanks and jets used by Syria during the war, as well as captured Israeli weapons with placards highlighting that the weapons are “Made in the U.S.A.” The museum and its exhibits were built in collaboration with North Korea, which is evident from the socialist-realist concrete friezes near the museum’s entrance, as well as the painted portrait of former Syrian President Hafez al-Asad hand-in-hand with former North Korean Leader Kim il-Sung featured in the main gallery. The gallery is full of Asad family portraits, but its true gem is the wall-sized North Korean-painted mural depicting Hafez al-Asad in populist ecstasy as he is thronged by his people.

13,Cappadocia,"Aksaray, Turkey","In this historic region, homes and churches are carved into ancient volcanic rock formations.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cappadocia,"Located in the Nevşehir Province in the Central Anatolian region of Turkey, Cappadocia is an area where entire cities have been carved into the rock. An area with history so abundant and far-reaching as to render entire centuries as footnotes at first glance, the landscape appears as an abandoned alien desert with fields that look like waves frozen in time, and rocky spikes and spires protruding from the landscape like some sort of meringue set in stone. The rock formations that makeup Cappadocia were created by volcanic eruptions, erosion, and wind. Over three million years ago a volcanic eruption deposited a blanket of ash across the 1,500 square mile landscape which formed into a soft rock. This rock, slowly eaten away by wind and time, has created some spectacular forms. But the human history of the area is as compelling as the geological one. With rock soft enough that you can easily dig right into it, part of what adds to Cappadocia’s strange appearance is that carved into every hillside, spire, and boulder is a home complete with windows, bedrooms, kitchens, and multiple stories connected by ladders or steps. The pathways and structures carved from the rock hold a long history of struggle and resistance. As early as the 3rd century, the caves and tunnels within the rock formations were being used as a hiding place by Christians escaping persecution by the Romans. By the 10th and 11th centuries, Byzantine Christian monks were building hundreds of small churches—each beautifully painted and decorated—into the hillsides as monasteries and training grounds for early Christian missionaries. Nowhere else is the soft pliability of the landscape, and the ingeniousness of the ancient architecture more visible than in the nearby subterranean cities of Derinkuyu and Kaymakli. Derinkuyu is 11 stories deep, has dozens of miles of tunnels connecting it to other underground cities, and can accommodate many thousands of people. It is truly an underground city, with areas for sleeping, stables for livestock, pits for cooking, bathrooms, praying, even for being buried. Today, the tops of the tombs have eroded, exposing the narrow, empty graves. Some 200 underground structures have been discovered in Cappadocia, many of them connecting to each other via tunnels. Most people didn’t live in the underground cities full time. Underneath the cities was a vast network of tunnels, connecting each home in the area to the city. When the area came under attack, families would flee to their basements, rush through the dark tunnels, and gather in the underground city. The boundaries of historical Cappadocia are vague, particularly towards the west. To the west, Cappadocia is bounded by historical regions of Galatia and Lycaonia. To the south, the Taurus Mountains separate Cappadocia from Cilicia and the Mediterranean Sea. Roughly, the area is about 250 miles from east to west and 160 miles from north to south. The name Cappadocia has been co-opted by the tourism industry to refer to any place where natural wonders and geology provide the main forms of entertainment and attraction.

14,Basilica Cisterns of Istanbul,"Istanbul, Turkey",A marvel of Byzantine engineering under the streets of Istanbul.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/basilica-cisterns-istanbul,"A Frenchman visiting Constantinople (now Istanbul) in the 1500s heard strange stories of locals drawing up fresh water and even fishing from holes in their cellars. Intrigued by these stories and the legends of great underground temples, he decided to explore. Upon further investigation, he found a subterranean marvel, the largest of the long-forgotten palatial cisterns of the Byzantine Empire. Fish swam in an artificial freshwater lake the size of two football fields and the vaulted brick ceilings were held up by 336 30-foot pillars scavenged from nearby Roman ruins. Amazingly preserved despite centuries of conflict and siege, the cistern was built in 532 by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I to store fresh water for the palace and nearby buildings. Nicknamed Yearbatan Sarayi, or “The Sunken Palace” in Turkish, it is known in English as the “Basilica Cistern” because of its location on the site of an ancient basilica. When Justinian undertook the building of the cistern, Constantinople was still in the shadow of the devastating Nika Revolt which took place in January of that year. The Byzantine equivalent of soccer riots gone massively out of control, the revolt took place in the wake of a hotly contested chariot race and culminated in the burning of much of the imperial city, and the killing of 30,000 rioters by Justinian’s troops. The cisterns were built as part of the rebuilding efforts in the aftermath. In the past, visitors could rent a rowboat to float past the columns in the dripping gloom. Restorations in the late 1980s dredged the silted-in floor and added lighting, elevated walkways, and a cafe for visitors. There are still fish in the now-shallow water, helping to keep the water clear. The two giant Gorgon-head pillar bases at the far end of the cistern are an intriguing mystery. It is suspected that they may have been pulled out of an older pagan temple, where motifs of the famous Gorgon Medusa were used as a protective emblem. It is possible that the placement of these two faces—upside down and sideways, at the base of pillars—may have been a deliberate display of the power of the new Christian Empire. Or it’s possible that the stones were just the right size. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

15,Pamukkale Water Terraces,"Denizli, Turkey",Roman ruins top white travertine terraces formed by ancient hot springs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pamukkale-water-terraces,"Once a kind of Roman-era health spa, the spectacular rock formations below the ancient city of Hierapolis form a blindingly white natural cascading fountain. Waters from ancient hot springs spilling down the hillside for a millennia have formed terraces of oyster-shell shaped pools, the white travertine constantly refreshed by the flow of the calcium rich waters. Named the “Cotton Castle” in Turkish, the site has been celebrated as a natural wonder since the second century BC when the city of Hierapolis was formed around the healing waters. A thriving metropolis during the Roman era, the city survived and rebuilt several times following earthquakes, and it was not completely abandoned until 1300 AD. The ruins are extensive, including a Nymphaeum fountain which distributed water throughout the city, a large amphitheater, as well as the remains of the largest ancient necropolis in Turkey. Together with the ruins of Hierapolis, Pamukkale is now a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site. Before the designation, the terraces were in danger of being destroyed through a combination of neglect and commercial development. Hotels were built at the top of the site, partly obscuring ruins of Hierapolis , and wear and tear from the feet and shoes of visitors had scarred and turned many of the pools brown. Efforts to protect the delicate natural phenomenon have dramatically changed the area. Hotels have been demolished, and in an effort to allow the pools natural white appearance to be maintained, access to the pools is tightly restricted, and water released from the spring is controlled and only distributed to a few pools at a time. Artificial pools for bathing tourists have been added. Although natural phenomenon like this is exceedingly rare, a similar but smaller set of travertine pools exist in Huanglong, China. Sadly, another site beloved by Victorian settlers in New Zealand was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1886. Visitors should bring a backpack to comfortably carry their shoes, as you can explore the main drift of the mountain, but only barefoot.  The nearest town is Denizli, approximately 20km away.

Dating back to the 4th century BCE, the rock-cut tombs line the hills above Myra’s famed theater and the Church of St. Nicholas. These houses of the dead are divided into two main necropolises comprised of a mixture of house- and temple-style tombs: the ocean necropolis and the river necropolis.

18,Gobekli Tepe,"Örencik, Turkey",This hunter-gatherer architecture is believed to be the oldest religious complex known.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gobekli-tepe,"Summarizing the importance of the the archaeological site at Gobekli Tepe (Turkish for “Hill with a Belly”) is a formidable task. In 1994, German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt and his team unearthed a handful of findings that continue to revolutionize the way archeologists think about Stone Age man. The site dates back 11,500 years, to the tail end of the Stone Age. The predominant understanding was that during this time, hunter-gatherers roamed the Earth, never settling, living as each day came. The huge Gobekli Tepe complex, however, brings this view into question. It consists of large, T-shaped pillars with animal carvings, huge stone rings, and a vast amount of rectangular rooms, many believed to have religious importance. One theory is that this site was not used for domestic purposes, but for rituals and sacrifices and the site at Gobekli Tepe is believed by some to be the oldest religious complex known to modern man. For this reason, the site has often invited breathless comparisons to the Garden of Eden, or the “origin of religion,” which has long been associated with the Fertile Crescent and the ancient Sumerians, who invented written language. Equally curious is the fact that before this discovery, there was no evidence of hunter-gatherers ever erecting large monuments and buildings, making this perhaps the world’s oldest known architecture. Nearby the site is Mount Karaca Dag, a mountain that geneticists believe to be the birth place of many of today’s cultivated grains. It’s theorized that Gobleki Tepe could be showing us a transition period, depicting nomadic cultures’ first attempt to farm (which would later bring about permanent settlement). The one acre excavation site has raised more questions than it has answered, and astoundingly enough, the site is believed to extend some 22 additional acres. Around 8,000 B.C., the site was filled with soil and mysteriously abandoned.",lost tribes long now locations rites and rituals sacred spaces ruins architectural oddities architecture
19,Troy,"Çanakkale, Turkey",This famous city eluded concrete detection until the early 2000's.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/troy,"Famous for being the focal point of the legendary Trojan war, the city that was duped by a wooden horse was long theorized to exist around the region of modern Turkey, but it took decades of literary comparison to actually find the city of Troy. In 1868 German businessman and archeologist Heinrich Schliemann had a chance meeting with English archeologist Frank Calvert who had begun digging in Hisarlik, Turkey and the first step in finding Troy was underway. The two were able to uncover a number of overlapping classical ruins in the area pointing to a series of cities that were essentially built on top of one another over the early centuries. Excavations on the area continued unabated throughout the years after its groundbreaking, with each new team finding more and more artifacts and ruins in a seemingly endless series of discoveries. The Troy site would come to be one of the most complex archeological digs in history, revealing nine distinct ages of urban construction. Over the years researchers dug up coins, jewelry, defensive walls, theaters, and a number of other buildings. While all of the work at the Troy site was done under the general acceptance that the site was the actual location of the historical city, it was not confirmed (as much as such a thing can be) until 2001 when a team of researchers used a mix of geology, literary reference, and topography to identify the site.

20,Ottoman Bird Palaces,"Istanbul, Turkey",The ornate miniature mansions were built for Istanbul's feathered residents.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ottoman-bird-palaces,"Look up while roaming the streets of Istanbul, and you may see little palaces carved into the sides of its mosques and schools. The city’s birds have been calling these ornamented miniature mansions home for centuries. People had been building birdhouses before the dawn of the Ottoman Empire, but they weren’t as ornate. The ones the Ottomans built were not simple structures, but were instead complex multi-level houses with copious ornaments and details. With their intricate windows, balconies, roofs, and towers, they mimicked the sort of grand abode you’d expect to find a regal human living in. Creating the little bird palaces went beyond pure aesthetic appeal. It was said that building the houses and showing such kindness for the city’s feathered residents was a way to curry favor with God. The structures also kept birds from nesting inside buildings. Only a handful of such bird palaces remain, but you should find some in nearly every city in Turkey. Many of them have survived in Istanbul. They’re aged and weathered with time, but a number of them still boast the fantastic details that make them so intriguing. The oldest one is on the side of Büyükçekmece Bridge, close to the city.  In Istanbul there are many locations where you can find bird palaces. Just to name a few: Sayyed Hassan Pasha Madrasa, Laleli Mosque, Millet Kutuphanesi, Yeni Valide Mosque, Ayazma Mosque, and Taksim Mescidi.",birds houses homes architectural oddities animals history architecture

Known as Pluto’s Gate, or Ploutonion in Greek, the archeological site in southwestern Turkey was discovered in 2013 after following the route of a thermal spring. The site matches closely the description of the temple to the underworld that disappeared in the 6th century. Tourists to the portal to the underworld were able to buy small birds or other animals (the sale of which supported the temple) and test out the toxic air that blew out of the mysterious cavern, which was connected to a temple with a pool. Only the priests, high and hallucinating on the fumes, could stand on the steps by the opening to hell, and would sometimes lead sacrificial bulls inside, only to pull out their dead bodies dramatically. As the Greek geographer, philosopher, and prolific traveler Strabo, who lived from 64/63 BC to 24 AD), so enticingly described it: “This space is full of a vapor so misty and dense that one can scarcely see the ground. Any animal that passes inside meets instant death.

22,Kekova Island Sunken Ruins,"Kaleüçağız Köyü, Turkey",Hidden just under the waters around this Turkish island are the ruins of a once great city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kekova-island-sunken-ruins,"Before the Ottomans, the Byzantines, or the Romans, this remote corner of Turkey was home to the world’s first democratic federation, the remains of which are now sitting beneath the waves. The Lycians were a peaceful federation of city-states, dating from around 2000 BCE, and included the sea-trading city of Simena. In the 2nd century CE, Simena was hit by a series of violent earthquakes and sank beneath the waves. Today it is still possible to see the city ruins, clearly visible just a few meters below the clear waters of the Mediterranean. The ruins of Simena include a shipyard, foundations of public buildings,houses, and a couple of amphorae. Above the shoreline, further houses, a few Lycian tombs with their distinctive arched roofs, and the remains of an early church are visible. A stone staircase can also still be found descending into the calm waters. Kekova Island, where the ruins are located, is now uninhabited, although a few goats can be spotted grazing among the ruins. Occasionally a villager rows across to harvest the wild thyme (“kekik”) that gives the island its name. In 1990 the Turkish government declared Kekova Island and the surrounding region to be a Specially Protected Area, preserving it from further development. UNESCO also lists it as a “tentative” candidate for World Heritage status. Swimming, snorkeling, diving, and jet-skis are forbidden in the area around the sunken city; however, chartered boats are permitted to cruise above it at a slow pace, affording a good view of the ruins both above and below the waterline. Two-hour trips around the bay are available on rather crowded tour boats from nearby Ucagiz. If you're staying at Kaş or Kalkan it's more comfortable to join a scheduled full-day cruise on a gulet from Kaş. Gulets can also be privately chartered for a few days or a week exploring the Lycian coast. Another option is to book a kayak trip from Kaş: you start with a bus ride to the seaside village where the kayaks are, from where you paddle across the strait to Kekova, then back to the mainland for lunch in another village. There's a support boat, so if you get tired or the wind and waves pick up, you can get a ride back to the bus if you need it.",underwater islands ruins

Enter Tombili, a chubby white-bellied tabby cat with a peculiar penchant for slouching against steps rather than sitting atop them. Her friendly nature made her a beloved resident of Istanbul’s Ziverbey neighborhood. She was, as locals were quick to realize, a cool cat. Tombili’s fame spread beyond her usual haunts after an image of her lounging in her preferred pose went viral online and became a meme. In the picture, she leans against a step, one paw draped over her tubby white tummy while the other rests atop the concrete. She’s poised as if about to ask a question, perhaps a casual inquiry about how long you’ve been coming to the neighborhood, before launching into her own life story. If you’re a cat person with access to the internet, you’ve likely come across the image. The “Chill Cat” meme puts Tombili in a myriad of scenarios: settled on a lavish couch, beckoning someone to “paint her like one of their French girls;” dressed up like Julius Caesar, complete with a Roman toga; or lazed across her chosen perch with a drink. Sadly, the beloved cat died in August of 2016. The district mayor commemorated the famous feline by installing a sculpture of Tombili in her iconic pose atop a step on World Animal Day. The sculpture was stolen a month after its installation, but after much public outcry, the thieves returned it to its original spot.

24,Viking Runes at Hagia Sophia,"Istanbul, Turkey",A small etching on the white marble parapet was written in runic script by a Viking mercenary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viking-runes-at-hagia-sophia,"On a balmy Thracian Sunday some 1,100 years ago, during a liturgy given in the massive basilica of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, possibly during the solemn, laborious prayer of the Anaphora, a bored soldier carved his name into the white marble parapet that surrounds the balcony of the church’s upper gallery. The letters he carved, however, weren’t Greek; this wasn’t a native warrior, but a Viking mercenary from the Scandinavian lands of the north. His runic inscription is still visible today. They read, approximately, “Halfdan carved these runes,” or “Halfdan was here,” a familiar sentiment shared by crude etchings across the millennia. A transparent plastic slab protects the inscription, which can be found in the gallery on the second floor of the basilica. The Vikings who came to Constantinople to seek glory and occasionally great wealth were known as the Varangian Guard, after the Greek word for Viking or Norseman. The tradition of their service dates to the 9th century, when the Kievan Rus and the Byzantine Empire settled a peace treaty that allowed for some Rus warriors to join the empire’s army. Later Varangians included Harald Hardrada, who fought with the Byzantines against the muslims in Sicily before becoming King of Norway, as well as many 11th-century Anglo-Saxons ironically exiled from Britain by another group of Norsemen, the Normans. The Varangians were prized not just for their massive size and handiness with an axe, but for their loyalty, as they had been steeped in an oath-driven warrior culture that prized fealty to one’s lord. Also, having no local connections, the Viking mercenaries couldn’t be suspected of conspiracy with the Emperor’s enemies, who more often than not were located within the treacherous court of Constantinople rather than outside its walls.",mosques vikings language churches sacred spaces history
25,Ani Ghost City,"Ocaklı Köyü, Turkey","An abused and forgotten metropolis, abandoned for centuries.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ani-ghost-city,"“The army entered the city, massacred its inhabitants, pillaged and burned it, leaving it in ruins and taking prisoner all those who remained alive…The dead bodies were so many that they blocked the streets; one could not go anywhere without stepping over them.” -Arab historian Sibt ibn al-Jawzi, c. 1064 Sacked, abandoned and forgotten, the magnificent medieval city of Ani was once home to as many as 200,000 people, but has stood empty and in ruins for centuries. Called by some the “City of 1001 Churches,” and by others the “City of Forty Gates,” Ani is situated in disputed territory within the Turkish province of Kars, near the border with Armenia. The city was originally Armenian, but the territory on which it stands is still argued over between modern day Turkey and Armenia. Once a contemporary rival of Constantinople, Baghdad and Cairo, Ani fell to a succession of invaders . Both contributing to the ruin’s slow demise and as a result of its deterioration, earthquakes, war, and vandalism have all take their toll. However, sentiment is emerging that the city needs to be protected no matter whose jurisdiction it falls under. The city’s many remaining churches are extraordinarily beautiful, even in their ruined state. The minaret Menüçehr Mosque, newer than many of the churches but still nearly a thousand years old, still stands as a testament to the city’s long history and diverse cultural influences. International heritage organizations have long been concerned with Ani’s fate. In 1996, 1998 and 2000 ,Ani was included in the World Monument Fund’s Watch Lists of 100 Most Endangered Sites. Official permission was needed to visit or photograph the site until 2004, but as notions of conservation and historical intrigue have sparked more of an interest in the area, regulations like these are no longer needed and it has become much easier to visit Ani today. Despite recent improvements, in 2010 Ani was identified by the Global Monument Fund as part of their report on endangered world heritage sites. In 2011 the World Monument Fund announced the beginning of official restoration work in partnership with the Turkish Ministry of Culture.",relics and reliquaries ghost towns catacombs and crypts abandoned ruins
26,Tombs of the Sultans,"Istanbul, Turkey","Five sultans and their families rest in eternal splendor, teeming with overlooked beauty and drama.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tombs-of-the-sultans,"Thanks to the Ottomans’ incredible sense of aesthetic, the tombs of Mehmed III, Selim II, Murad III, İbrahim I and Mustafa I more closely resemble stunning palaces in tribute to the memory of sultans past than what likely leaps to mind when conjuring images of eternal resting places for ancient, deceased royals. The complex itself is arranged in a linear formation along the periphery of the Hagia Sophia. Often overlooked and quite literally overshadowed by what is possibly Istanbul’s most iconic sight, the tombs date from as early as 1574 and make extraordinary use of tilework, calligraphy, and paintwork. No two are alike, despite sharing common motifs arranged according to the preference of their designers, several of which were designed by the famous architect Mimar Sinan. With doors flung open to the public, the sultans and their families retain their dignity and privacy by way of shrouds of an impenetrable emerald green color draped over their sarcophagi. Sloping at crisp angles, standing bold against a field of fine ornate tiles, these eternal family portraits are uniquely striking. The closer one looks at the details, the more fascinating the sultans’ tombs become. Particularly true of this is the tomb of Sultan Selim II. On the architectural front, the fine blue tiles on the door’s left side appear lighter in color due for the originals were removed in 1895; sent to France for restoration, they somehow ended up in the Louvre, where they remain to this day. The pale blue tiles on the tomb’s door are replacements that don’t quite match the originals on the opposing door. Similarly, though the sarcophagi themselves are intentionally anonymous under deceptively uniform shrouds, a look into the backstory of each family reveals the humanity and drama hidden beneath. Selim II’s tomb is noticeably packed with family members, many of whom seem oddly small at the time of their deaths. Though not posted anywhere inside, history reveals that during the course of one single night in 1574, five of his younger sons were murdered to ensure Murad III’s succession. But it doesn’t stop there… 19 of Murad’s own sons also can be found resting alongside him, murdered to ensure his eldest’s succession, after which point the grisly practice of fratricide was put to an end. Imagine: this describes just one of the five tombs resting in the shadow of Hagia Sophia. The rest of the details – beautiful and chilling – await your deep dive into the individual lives of the sultans, their wives, each architect, and their designers. They’ll be there waiting, ever so patiently.  Located at the southeast corner of Hagia Sophia",tombs royalty death
27,Abandoned Village of Kayakoy,"Kayaköy, Turkey",A Turkish ghost town abandoned in a population exchange with Greece.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kayakoy-turkey,"The deserted ruins of this once-bustling town are nestled against the Taurus Mountains, close to the world-famous beaches and yacht-filled harbor at Olu Deniz. Although the stone buildings are roofless and weathered and the narrow streets worn with age, this is not an ancient city, but a modern ruin deserted for political reasons in the 1920s. In Lycian times, the town was known as Karmilassos. When the Greeks occupied it, they changed its name to Levissi. The first mention of Levissi dates back to the 14th century and it belongs to Sanudo, an Italian traveler. Originally built in the 1700s, the town called Karmylassos in Greek was home to as many as 20,000 Greek Orthodox residents by the early twentieth century. The messy fallout of World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire led to the land grabs of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). The resounding loss of the Greeks in this war ended with violence and retribution, which was often aimed at the remaining Greek Orthodox community within the new Turkish borders, and in turn, against the Muslim Turks in Greece. Hundreds of thousands of Greeks fled the violence in Turkey, which led the governments to agree to a mutual compulsory population exchange starting in 1923 in order to staunch the bloodshed. The residents of Kayakoy, who had thus far lived peacefully with their Turkish neighbors, abandoned the town and went to Greece, which was struggling to find places for the nearly 200,000 refugees of the exchange, added to the more than a million former Turkish residents who had fled before the official exchange. Over 300,000 Turks were forcibly removed from Greece to a war-ravaged, but land-rich, Turkey in exchange. The polar explorer and Nobel Prize-winning Norwegian scientist Fridtjof Nansen was assigned the task of organizing the exchange. In Kayakoy, approximately 350 homes now sit empty and mostly roofless, along with two Greek Orthodox churches and the fountains and cisterns that watered the city. Harsh winters and strong winds have stripped the buildings down to ruins, making the town look ancient. A private museum tells the story of the town. The book Birds Without Wings by Louis de Bernieres is set in a fictionalized version of Karakoy during WWI and the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Kayaköy was adopted by the UNESCO as a World Friendship and Peace Village. The closest airport is Dalaman.

Old-growth forest now embrace the tumbled stone ruins of Termessos. Said to have been founded by the mythological hero Bellerophon, during its heyday, the city was known for its impenetrable defense thanks to its mountaintop location, rising over a thousand meters into the sky. In reality it was founded by a community known as the Solims. Little is known of the people or the culture of Termessos despite it being incredibly well preserved, with most of the information gleaned from stories and histories. The towns remoteness served it well, providing it with some autonomy from Rome and sparing it from being sacked by Alexander the Great who referred to it as “the Eagle’s Nest.” However its remote mountaintop location would also be its downfall. Although little is known, it is believed that the town was abandoned sometime around 200 C.E. an earthquake destroyed the towns aqueduct, cutting off its supply of water. The Solims seemed to have simply walked away leaving a remarkably preserved town behind. A large number of stone structures and exposed tombs remain on the site, although some of them have been plundered. Because the site is not under strict archeological control many reliefs and inscriptions have been relocated to the nearby Museum of Antalya. Although it’s a short drive from Antalya, getting there involves a steep hike up the mountain from the top of the road, so it lacks the usual tourist crowds of the southern Turkish coast.  Visitors can watch clouds pass by through the empty windows behind the stunning ancient amphitheater, and admire the ancient tombs lining the path up the mountain.

It’s harder than it sounds: Since secretive guilds during the Ottoman era prohibited chefs from writing down recipes, putting that food on the table has required some serious detective work. A team of academics and researchers collaborated with the restaurant’s chefs to craft a repertoire of hundreds of recipes, including many that are tied to specific dates. Specialties include almond soup from 1539 served with pomegranate and nutmeg, 17th-century fried liver rissoles dunked in sweet-and-sour molasses, and slow-cooked goose atop almond pilaf.

The hieroglyphics-covered spire that now sits in a square in Istanbul was originally carved between 1500-1400 BCE in Egypt. The red granite spire sat unmolested near the Temple of Karnak for hundreds of years, and it wasn’t until the mid-300’s CE that a Roman emperor had the obelisk transported down the river Nile to Alexandria. The huge artifact remained there for only a scant few decades before it was once again moved. This time the stone tower was moved to what was at the time Constantinople where it resides today. As the famous song says, Constantinople is now Istanbul which is where the Obelisk of Theodosius still sits. The spire is remarkably well maintained for being thousands of years old and the columns of hieroglyphics on each of the four sides are still sharp and clear. The pictograms describe the obelisk’s creator’s (Tutmoses III) victory during a battle on the Euphrates.

Likely first established around the 7th or 8th century B.C., the massive subterranean complex in Turkey was built by the ancient population of the time to provide protection against invading forces. And what a defense it became. Continually growing since its inception, and significantly expanded during the Byzantine period centuries later, the hidden “city” is thought to have been able to protect 20,000 inhabitants for long periods of time thanks to a number of surprisingly advanced, if crudely implemented innovations. The city descends 18 stories underground, deeper than any of the other underground complexes found in the area, and is fitted with thousands of ventilation shafts and waterways that provided fresh air and water to each level of the site. There were rooms for stables, churches, lodging, storage, and of course a winery, lest the citizens become bored during a siege. The city was protected by doors made of massive stone wheels that could be rolled in from of an entrance, essentially making it another wall. Today, over 600 entrances to the Derinkuyu Underground City have been found in courtyards and private residences around the city giving the impression that there may have been some holes in this impressive defense, but hundreds of entries or not, it is doubtful that many enemies could make it past two-foot stone doors.",fortresses subterranean subterranean sites archaeology

35,Piri Reis Map at Topkapi Palace,"Istanbul, Turkey","1513 Turkish world map, full of European state secrets and snarky commentary.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/piri-reis-map-at-topkapi-palace,"As officials and historians prepared the historic Tokapi Palace in Istanbul for its conversion into a museum in 1929, a previously unknown and beautiful world map was discovered. Although only a fragment of the original, the map immediately attracted attention for its extensive annotations and the intriguing appearance of what appeared to be the American continents on a map just 21 years after Columbus’s expeditions, and before other Western European expeditions were able to report their early discoveries with maps. Drawn on gazelle skin, the map was the work of the Ottoman admiral and cartographer Piri Reis in 1513 (the map is actually dated to 919 according to the Muslim calendar). He claimed in the extensive notes he left on the map to have drawn his inspiration from more than 20 source maps, some dating back to the time of Alexander the Great. The map is highly accurate in most ways for its time, although it does have many flaws typical of maps drawn from second-hand information. The notes discuss the various sources of information, and also include a running commentary on places featured in the map, which are sometimes quite colorful. For example: “This country is a waste. Everything is in ruin and it is said that large snakes are found here. For this reason the Portuguese infidels did not land on these shores and these are also said to be very hot.” Piri Reis went on to create several maps and in 1521 wrote his masterpiece Kitab-ı Bahriye, or “Book of Navigation.” Reis was no bookish scholar though, and he went on to have a life of sailing and adventure, participating in the siege of Rhodes in 1522, and ended his days in Egypt, where after refusing to support the Ottoman government he was publicly beheaded. The Piri Reis Map has also been a subject of much controversy in both academic and crackpot circles, with the source materials for the map and their significance being debated. Historians spent years looking for a long lost map of Columbus, as cited by Reis in the margins, “The coasts and islands on this map are taken from Colombo’s map.” Since no Columbus map has ever been found, this was a tantalizing bit of information, but as of yet, no such map has emerged. Crackpots saw in the accuracy of the map the handiwork of Atlanteans or aliens. The situation came to a head in 1968 when the map was featured as an example of “impossible ancient knowledge” in the book “Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past.” Things have settled down in the years since. It has been studied and examined and found to be impressive but not without flaws in keeping with its time, and more than anything it serves as a top notch example of military intelligence gathering and cartography. Although the Piri Reis Map is often referred to as the oldest extant map showing the American continent, at least four older maps show America: the 1500 Spanish Juan de la Cosa Map, the 1502 Portuguese Cantino Planisphere, the 1505 Italian Caverio Map, and the Waldesmuller Map of 1507, a copy of which is at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. A fragment of a later map by Piri Reis showing parts of North America also exists to this day. Sadly, the Piri Reis Map is not on public display, but along with his a copy of his 1521 Kitab-ı Bahriye, or “Book of Navigation”, is a part of the archives of the Topkapi Palace Library.",marvelous maps and measures
36,Yanartaş,Turkey,"Flames have been burning within this mountain for more than 2,500 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yanartas,"From a distance, this rocky landmass looks like any other mountain. But climb to the top, and you’ll realize this is no ordinary place. Flames flicker from gaps in the side of the mountain. They’ve been burning for at least 2,500 years, fueled by methane seeping through the vents. It’s said that in the past, sailors used the mountain as a sort of burning beacon, the blazes providing an easy-to-see landmark. In modern times, hikers use the ever-present fires to brew tea or toast marshmallows. The mountain is also linked to the legend of the Chimera, as it’s believed the flaming landscape inspired the fiery monster in Homer’s Illiad. According to the myth, a beast with a lion’s head, goat’s body, and a snake as a tail lived on a mountain. The King of Lycia sent Bellerophon to the mountain to kill the monster. He rode his horse Pegasus there, and when the Chimera started to attack, he speared the creature.  To reach the flames, you'll need to climb stone stairs. There are no arrows pointing where you should go, but it's easy to find because there is no other way. The climbing takes 15 to 20 minutes, at the end of it you'll get very tired and probably sweaty, but it's worth it. It's better to go there at night to see the flames. It will be dark when you climb but you can use a flashlight (your phone's light is fine). At night the flames look better. You can bring marshmallows or sausage to cook there. And a little wine to make it perfect. The most important thing is to bring water with you, as you'll get thirsty. Wear sneakers or other shoes suitable for hiking.

37,"Safranbolu, Turkey","Safranbolu, Turkey",Ottoman-era houses lovingly preserved.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/safranbolu,"Go ahead: Spend the night and enjoy a Turkish bath in the hamam in the morning. Get up early and explore this city, the one where even the Turks travel for vacation, before everyone else wakes up. It’s the only way to see it unspoiled, we’re told. But that’s an exaggeration. This city is worth exploring any time of day and is the ideal destination for those who like to avoid the typical tourist traps and throngs of vacationers; you won’t find many foreign visitors in Safranbolu. Named after safran, which was a major export of this region, Safranbolu was an important caravan station on the major trade routes of the region that existed between the 13th and early 20th centuries. As it continued to grow, Safranbolu thrived; by the 17th century, the city’s architecture influence most of the urban development throughout much of the Ottoman Empire. The Old Town, which is the name of the city center in Safranbolu, still stands, preserved for visitors to enjoy. Many of the old buildings, which more than 1,000 registered historical artifacts, include 25 mosques, a private museum, tombs, several Turkish baths, a historical clock tower, foundations, a sundial, and hundreds of mansions and houses. Safranbolu also includes historical bridges, rock tombs, and ancient settlements, none of which are to be missed if you have the time to visit during your stay. The Old Town - the place that holds all of these buildings - is itself a site to behold, situated deep in a ravine. Though it took its name from it, safran doesn’t play as large a role in the continuing development of this city as the caravans have slowly dried up. Still, industrialization, while it has come to - and transformed - many nearby towns, has not yet hit Safranbolu. In 1994, UNESCO declared the city a World Heritage site because of its well-reserve Ottoman architecture and houses. Costumed staff in cafes and restaurants serve Ottoman cuisine to help keep the era alive.

The underground cities of the region were likely initially built by peoples around 2000 BCE and later expanded upon by later civilizations as they moved in and out of the area. The multi-chambered city contains areas for storage, living quarters, wine-making, and stables like many of its sister cities in the region. While Kaymaklı may not have the innovative defenses of the Özkonak underground city, or the staggering depths of the Derinkuyu underground city, but what it does have is sheer floor space, clocking in at much wider than any of the other cities. Also unlike the other underground fortresses, many of the chambers and tunnels of the ancient fortification are still used by inhabitants in the region as storage and living space as they were some of the first people to find the historical city beneath their feet. Although in its heyday, the Kaymaklı Underground City contained eight floors of subterranean defense, but currently only four of the floors are open to the public.",subterranean subterranean sites

The triumph of the ottoman empire in the battle led not only to the fall of Byzantine Constantinople, but marked the end of the Roman Empire. The city became the new capitol of the Ottoman Empire.

While the cave’s entrance is visually obstructed by olive trees and wildflowers, it receives a steady circulation of visitors who descend some 50 feet down a stone pathway to reach a cold pool fed by mountain runoff and seawater. The cave is a sacred point of interest known for its unusual place in local mythology. Legend has it that Zeus would take refuge in the cave whenever he angered his brother Poseidon, ruler of the sea and storms. An enraged Poseidon would whip up a deadly tempest, and Zeus would take cover in this subterranean lair. Another version of the story says that Zeus would slip away from Mount Olympus to swim with village girls where his wife, Hera, couldn’t find him. There are multiple so-called Caves of Zeus around the Aegean region, each of which has a fabled tie to the King of the Olympian gods. When visiting this cave, some people bring a cloth, which they wish upon before tying it around an olive tree at the cave’s mouth. Update as of December 2021: The cave is no longer accessible.  The Cave of Zeus is a popular hotspot with locals and tourists alike. It’s easily accessible by bus, and a recommended pitstop for visitors to the Dilek Peninsula-Büyük Menderes Delta National Park. The pathway to the pool at the cave’s base is slippery, so it’s advised that visitors take caution during their descent.

They make a wish and stick a thumb into a hole within the structure, then attempt to rotate the finger in a perfect circle. Supposedly, if their finger gets wet, it means their wish will be fulfilled or their illnesses will be healed. The column is known as the “wishing column” or the “perspiring column.” The modest pole would go unnoticed, if not for the crowds of people attempting to jam their fingers into its small orifice. The column is known to be damp to the touch, probably as a result of moisture that gathers on its surface. But according to local legend, its wetness comes from more legendary sources. The most popular legend says that the column has been exuding some sort of healing liquid since Saint Gregory the Miracle Worker appeared near it in the year 1200. Some say that it “cries” because of a sultan’s pity. The weirdly wet column and its legendary powers prompted someone to shield the column with protective bronze plates. But this wasn’t enough to stop the pilgrims seeking an answer for their ailments.

42,Aspendos Theater,"Serik, Turkey",The best-preserved ancient theater in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aspendos-theater,"The ancient city of Aspendos lies in Southern Turkey, in the ancient region of Pamphylia. Due to its location along the once-navigable Eurymedon River, it rose in wealth and prominence with the trade of valuable resources, and was successively ruled by Greeks, Persians, and Romans. A number of ancient structures survive today, including the nymphaeum, basilica, and agora, but the architectural jewel of Aspendos is its theater, widely consider the best-preserved ancient theater in the world. The theater was built during the reign of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (160 to 180). Thanks to inscriptions on its walls, we know exactly who designed it: Zenon, son of Theodorus. The inscriptions also tell us that the Greek architect, who was born in Aspendos, was funded by two rich brothers, A. Curtius Crispinus Arruntianus and A. Curtius Crispinus, who gifted the theater to the city. Despite being built during Roman rule, the theater displays many Greek characteristics. As was tradition, the spectator tribune is dug out of the eastern slope of the acropolis. The rest—the stage, rear wall and flanking towers—are constructed from a system of stone-built arches and vaults. The sheer scale of the Aspendos Theater is impressive. The overall width of the theater is 315 feet (96 meters), with other elements following general proportions: the width of the stage is half the width of the building, and the diameter of the orchestra is half the width of the stage. The spectator tribune, meanwhile, is divided in two parts by a horizontal walkway called the diazoma. The lower section contains 20 rows of seat, while the upper has 21 rows. The theater’s capacity has been estimated at between 7,300 and 7,600 people at least, with room for 8,500 spectators if the stairs were used as seating (other estimates have placed the capacity at around 20,000, but that would have been a tight squeeze indeed). The theater is also known for its excellent acoustics and exquisite architectural ornamentation. The two-story stage building is particularly impressive and, like most of the theater, has been exceptionally well preserved. This is largely due to the city’s continuous settlement through to the Byzantine and Seljuk periods. The Seljuks had used the theater as a caravanserai, and restored the structure in the 13th century. In 1909, the British archaeologist David George Hogarth was very much dazzled by the theater. He wrote: “This is not like anything that I ever saw before. You may have seen the amphitheaters in Italy, France, Dalmatia and Africa; temples in Egypt and Greece; the palaces in Crete; you may be sated with antiquity or scornful of it. But you have not seen the theatre of Aspendos.” And today, the theater is still being used for its original purpose. Every year since 1994, the Aspendos Theater has hosted the Aspendos International Opera and Ballet Festival, with thousands of people taking to the stands—just as they did 2,000 years ago.  The Aspendos Theater is located in the ancient city of Aspendos, about 25 miles east of the modern city of Antalya, Turkey. Most people visit Aspendos on a tour from Antalya or Side, which includes the theater and other ancient structures nearby.",theaters preservation roman ancient archaeology
43,The Museum of Innocence,"Istanbul, Turkey",This museum was invented in a novel before being made real by the author.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-museum-of-innocence-2-istanbul-turkey,"In the backstreets of Çukurcuma, sloping towards the Bosporus from Istiklal Caddesi, the main pedestrian commercial thoroughfare of Istanbul, is the Museum of Innocence, a collection of items straight from a work of fiction. It is the work of novelist Orhan Pamuk, whose novel The Museum of Innocence was conceived of and created along with the museum itself. “And yet,” writes Pamuk, “just as the novel is entirely comprehensible without a visit to the museum, so is the museum a place that can be visited and experienced on its own. The museum is not an illustration of the novel, and the novel is not an explanation of the museum.” Pamuk’s novel follows the life of Kemal, an upper-class man from Istanbul, through the 1960s and 70s. Kemal develops an obsessive love with his young cousin Füsun, whom he pursues. His pursuit takes him to Füsun’s family home in Çukurcuma, to a building which becomes the fictional, and now the physical, museum. Inside the museum are objects which evoke stories and memories of the Istanbul of the 1970s. Some objects, such as Füsun’s dress or driver’s license or the view from her room, are taken directly from the novel. Objects are displayed in cases corresponding to chapters in the novel. On the ground floor of the museum is a large spiral, representing the Aristotelian conception of time as the line which links the series of unbreakable, atomic moments of the “present,”—the concept from which objects of the museum link the moments of the novel to the characters living out its arc. In creating the Museum of Innocence, Pamuk was driven by the sentiment that “museums should explore and uncover the universe and humanity of the new and modern man emerging from increasingly wealthy non-Western nations.” Pamuk’s catalogue of the Museum of Innocence, The Innocence of Objects, includes a “modest manifesto for museums.” This manifesto suggests guidelines from which the actual museum could be understood and experienced. For example: “5. The measure of a museum’s success should not be its ability to represent a state, a nation or company, or a particular history. It should be its capacity to reveal the humanity of individuals.” “9. If objects are not uprooted from their environs and their streets, but are situated with care and ingenuity in their natural homes, they will already portray their own stories.” “11. The future of museums is inside our own homes.” The Museum of Innocence may be the first museum that was born in fiction, created in the real world, and actively continues to affect the future of such institutions.  From the Museum of Innocence website: The Museum of Innocence is in Istanbul, in the neighbourhood of Çukurcuma, between İstiklal Avenue and Tophane. Walking distances from nearby landmarks are, in minutes: 12 from Taksim, 8 from Galatasaray, 8 from Tophane, 10 from Istanbul Modern, 10 from Cihangir. For those making their way to the museum by tram, the nearest stop is Tophane, an 8 minute walk away.",literature museums and collections museums

Olympos Coastal National Park, home to scattered Roman ruins and a picturesque beach, is the site that inspired a number of legends of Greek mythology, most notably the Chimera. Olympos’ name is derived from Mount Olympus, a site which more than 20 mountains now hold claim. However, one legend of the area is more probable than Turkey playing home to the 12 Olympian Gods. A short hike from Olympos beach, is Mount Chimera, located in the ancient region of Lycia. Referred to as Yanartaş today, the area features a number of vents spread out over 1.2 acres that spew methane gas, and subsequently fire. In ancient times, this volcanic phenomena was unexplained, and led to the myth of Chimera, a massive lion-snake-goat monster that breathed fire. Today, the legend is simply myth but the vents still spew fire and the area is well-trafficked by hikers looking for Roman ruins and a look into the birth of a Greek myth.",fiery wonders fires beaches geological oddities parks natural wonders geology nature ruins

Built over an entire century by generations of the Pasha family, the Middle Eastern-inspired arches and domes of the sprawling palace have survived for over 400 years. Sitting near the Iranian border, the architectural design of the palace is heavily influenced by its neighboring culture, forgoing the intricate spires of traditional Ottoman buildings. The palace was outfitted with a dizzying array of facilities and amenities including a bakery, a mosque, dungeons, and even a harem. All with a crude central heating system! Despite all of its decadent finery, the heyday of Ishak Pasha Palace was not to last. With the fall of the Ottomans came the abandonment of the palace, leaving it to rot on its strategically advantageous perch. To this day the halls of the palace remain empty although the site is now a protected historical landmark. Visitors to the palace can still look upon the windswept courtyards and empty halls, taking in the legendary look of the palace’s silhouette.

46,St. Stephen Bulgarian Iron Church,"Istanbul, Turkey","The most metal church of all time was built in record time because of an international, pious pissing contest.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-stephen-bulgarian-iron-church,"Istanbul has no shortage of houses of worship, and the Bulgarian Church of St. Stephen set along the shore of the Golden Horn blends in with its holy brethren at first glance. Upon closer inspection, however, this cross-shaped basilica is like few others in the world. Born of an early 19th-century period of architectural experimentation in prefabrication, St. Stephen is made entirely out of cast iron. Even to this day, the walls are metal and spots of rust bloom from its interior archways like scarified flowers. The church consists of poured iron slabs that were floated on cargo ships from Vienna, down the Danube River, across the Black Sea, through the Bosphorus, only to then be assembled on-site. It was cost-effective, it was efficient, but it was weird. The process never caught on. According to a popular tale, Sultan Abdülaziz was disinclined to allow the city’s Bulgarian Orthodox minority to build its church. “Permitting” its construction in a fashion he surely thought foolproof, the sultan stipulated St. Stephen must be completed within a single month’s time. But, like so many fantastic stories, the tale of the sultan’s challenge and the Bulgarian triumph isn’t quite true. The story of St. Stephen’s Church began with the Bulgarian government funding a competition to design the church, which was won by Armenian architect Hovsep Aznavur. The government then began the process of awarding a bid for the casting of Aznavur’s molds, ultimately achieved by the Rudolph Philip Waagner Company, which succeeded in transporting all 500 tons of the disassembled church to its current location in Istanbul’s Fatih district. Though the church was assembled remarkably quickly even by modern standards, it still would not have met the sultan’s demands. The only remaining original feature from the wooden church that predated the Iron Church is its stone altar, still in use to this day. Inaugurated on September 8, 1898, one of the world’s few full-metal churches has remained in constant use ever since. Visitors to St. Stephens remain entranced by the trails of rust creeping above an opulent Orthodox nave, speaking to its long journey by boat, only to arrive at the water’s edge all along.

Hints of its architectural beauty, like the intricate stone roses blooming all around its bay windows and fancy wrought-iron balconies, provide a glimpse of the building’s former glory. Flora Han (also spelled Vlora Han) was built at the beginning of the 20th century with a rather mundane purpose: to house offices. Its beautiful architecture highlights the western influences that crept into the city at a time when the Ottoman court was enthralled with the Art Nouveau styles spreading throughout European cultures. Many of the buildings are the work of Italian architect Raimondo D’Aronco. Architects appointed by the Sultan built similar Art Nouveau buildings all over Beyoğlu, Nişantaşı, and on the Bosphorus. Istanbul embraced this style of architecture, and buildings sporting asymmetrical façades and floral details popped up throughout the city, even spreading to its Anatolian side. But, as with most trends, enthusiasm eventually waned. As such, the magnificent Flora Han fell into disrepair. The filth clinging to its edges and the assortment of advertisements pasted across its exterior now mask the building’s grandeur.

The cistern was built during the reign of Emperor Justinian (527-565 AD).

Seven of its columns were reinforced with bricks during the Ottoman era. Nakkaş, the carpet sure, has made sure to protect the cistern.

A few years later, they founded their own bank branching into finance. Abraham Salomon Camondo, brother of the bank’s founder, inherited the bank after his brother Isaac died in 1832. Until the Imperial Ottoman Bank was founded in 1863, he served the empire as its prime banker. He financially assisted Venice and aided in its liberation from Austrian control. For these contributions, he was ennobled by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy in 1870. Abraham died three years later, but his two grandsons succeeded in expanding their banking business in Paris. The family did not survive World War II, as the last of its members were murdered in Auschwitz. Their legacies can still be found in Istanbul, including their seaside mansion, which is currently used by the Turkish Navy. But the most notable, and perhaps most loved is the Camondo Stairs in Galata, which were built by Abraham Salomon Camondo during the 1870s. Designed with a fusion of the Neo-Baroque and early Art Nouveau styles, this curvaceous, almost Gaudí-esque stairway was constructed as a shortcut for Camondo to reach Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street), and for his children to go to school.

Originally built in the early 900’s, the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross was part of a large religious complex that accompanied then king Gagik I Artsruni’s home which once sat on the island. The church was built in a blocky architectural style that makes the building seem rather uninteresting from afar, but up close the church is almost completely covered in ornate bas-relief carvings. While there are a number of decorative flourishes, the majority of the carvings actually illustrate stories from the Bible such as David and Goliath. Some scholars have argued that the scenes depict more directly Turkish vignettes but most agree that the influence is mainly Biblical. After King Artsruni’s reign ended, the church became the home of the Armenian Catholicos of Aghtamar (the equivalent of a local Patriarch) until the late 1800s. The church was looted during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and the monastic buildings destroyed. The church was almost demolished in 1951, but a Kurdish writer was able to save the site, which had fallen victim to years of vandalism and violence. The church was finally restored in 2005, however, since it was now under the jurisdiction of the Turkish government it was reopened as a museum and not a place of worship. This secularization did not sit well with many Armenians who felt that a piece of their religious past was being lost. However, despite protests and outrage, the museum was opened anyway.

In the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire was opening to international trade and many Europeans began to settle in the then capital. Many of them lived in the ​​Pera neighborhood (today known as Beyoğlu), where residences, luxury hotels, and embassies were located at the top of a steep hill, and the banks, warehouses, and exchange offices where many Europeans worked were located at the base, closer to the ports lining the Golden Horn. When the French engineer Eugène-Henri Gavand first arrived in Istanbul in 1867, he was surprised to see how many people trekked down and up the steep hill on Yüksek Kaldirim Avenue every day. He thought a funicular railway would make the trip easier. Gavand returned to France to prepare his project, and in 1869 presented it to Sultan Abdelaziz. The project was approved but delayed for several years during the Franco-Prussian War. Construction resumed after the war and Tünel opened to the public in January 1875. At that time, the train consisted of a steam engine pulling two wooden cars. The first car held passengers, while the second was used to transport goods livestock and carriages. The line was closed for modernization in 1968, reopening in 1971 with electric power and steel cars. It continues to operate today. The Tünel is part of the historic city’s transportation network, moving about 12,000 people between the Karakoy and Beyoğlu stations every day.  You can access the Tünel from the Karakoy and Beyoğlu stations. Karakoy station is close to Galata Bridge, which crosses the Golden Horn.",funicular subways trains transportation
55,Pudding Shop (Lale Restaurant),"Istanbul, Turkey","This crucial gathering spot along the ""hippie trail"" still displays old notes between traveling beatniks and backpackers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pudding-shop-lale-restaurant,"Istanbul is a fascinating city. It is rich in history and culture, uniquely located on the Europe-Asia border. So it is natural that those who travel on a budget, whether they start from Europe or Asia, would end up in the Turkish city sooner or later. Opened by brothers İdris and Namık Çolpan in 1957, the Pudding Shop originally started under the name of the “Lale Restaurant.” It was (and still is) located in the Sultanahmet district, not far from the city’s popular tourist spots such as the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, and the Basilica Cisterns. During the 1960s, the Lale Restaurant became a popular meeting place among beatniks as well as hippies traveling along the famous “hippie trail,” between Europe and South Asia. While enjoying their meals, the customers conversed with one another about their experiences. At this time, the restaurant was a go-to place in the area where travelers could get direct transportation to Asia and tourist information on Turkey. Seeing this, the owners put up a bulletin board to handle messages from people offering or hitching rides, as well as communications between family members, friends, and lovers. One well-known example was a love letter from one “Megan” to “Malcolm,” in which she apologized for “the business down in Greece.” The reputation of the restaurant spread by word of mouth, but many travelers failed to remember its name and simply referred to it as “the Pudding Shop,” as it was famous for its wide assortment of puddings, especially tavuk göğsü—a stiff, milk-based pudding with pounded chicken breast and a hint of cinnamon. The nickname stuck, and most people today know it as the Pudding Shop. It remained in business mostly unaffected by the end of the hippie era, its fame increased by the Istanbul-set 1978 film Midnight Express. The Pudding Shop still displays its old bulletin board and serves its famous puddings, along with a selection of traditional Turkish cuisine. Almost as charming as it was in its golden days, this old hippie hangout is a can’t-miss when you’re in Istanbul.",hippies pudding restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars
56,Çatalhöyük,"Çumra, Turkey",The largest Neolithic ruins in the world hide a notably clean prehistoric metropolis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/catalhoyuk,"First unearthed in 1958, the archeological gold mine known as Çatalhöyük has been revealed to be a massive city complex that likely housed around 10,000 residents among its interconnected system of primitive homes, most of which seem to be conspicuously free of debris. The tightly packed “city”was made of simple mud-brick rooms that seemed to have been added on again and again as the community grew and changed across the centuries of habitation. It is estimated that the ancient city reached its height around 7000 BCE with anywhere from 5-7,000 residents at a time, and possibly as many 10,000 at times. Strangely the structures seem to be exclusively domestic in purpose, with a noticeable lack of commercial or craft-centered spaces. The settlement also seems to lack any sort of trash or debris that is usually found at such archeological locations. It is possible that since each of the chambers was essentially a home (or whatever that term connoted in 7,000 BCE), they were kept cleaner than they might have been in a more cosmopolitan version of civilization with more public spaces. However, this is not to say that there was little to discover at the site. Countless figurines of animals and goddesses were discovered, along with copious cave paintings and other arts. And what the rooms lacked in trash, they made up for in human bones which it seems were ritually buried beneath the floors and hearths. Today portions of the site have been turned into living exhibits with recreated replicas of some of the rooms. Excavation continues at the site to this day, discovering both how our ancient ancestors lived and how clean they seemed to have been.",archaeology ruins
57,Nemrut Dagi,"Kayadere, Turkey",Mausoleum and Holy Seat of Antiochus I of Commagene.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nemrut-dagi,"The fall of Alexander the Great’s vast empire left a power vacuum in many of the territories he had conquered. Smaller kingdoms rose and absorbed citizens into their ranks, commanding new armies and new territories in fresh bids for power. One of these baby kingdoms was the Commagene, in modern day Turkey. Commagene was founded in the 2nd century B.C.E., and lived a tumultuous existence. Bouncing between kings and empires, Commagene was sporadically independent for only 200 years before being subsumed by the powerful Roman Empire in the 1st century C.E. Interestingly enough, this short-lived kingdom’s most notable architectural legacies were burial mounds and funeral statuary. The most prominent of these relics, is Nemrut Dagi, a massive tumulus and mausoleum dedicated to the most famous king of the Commagene, Antiochus I Theos of Commagene. Antiochus ruled from during the middle of the 1st century B.C.E., and his rule is commemorated in statuary and sandstone relief on top of Mount Nemrut. The mountain towers 2000 meters over the surrounding landscape. A drive up the mountain from the nearby towns at the base give incredible views the whole way up. Once at the apex, the heads of giant statues litter the side of the hill, showing great detail in depicting the Hellenistic-Age kings of Commagene. The sheer amount of statuary clearly indicates the importance of the area, and the immense beauty of the sanctuary. Although it is supposed that Nemrut Dagi holds the remains of Antiochus, exploration by archeologists in the mid 20th century, yielded no results in finding his burial chamber. Despite the lack of evidence, the surrounding statues tell a story of the Kingdom of Commagene, and provide details into an oft-forgotten ancient world. Along with the statues, the oldest-known work of art depicting a handshake is shown in a number of reliefs around the mound as well, adding an eerie pre-modern political element to the sanctuary. Climbing near the mount allows for spectacular views across the rocky and hilly landscape of this lost kingdom of Antiochus, and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

This, in part, was the thinking behind the construction of the commemorative Kaiser Wilhelm Fountain in Istanbul. But the fountain is a symbol of  much more significant events in Turkey’s past. The fountain was built in 1900 to celebrate the second anniversary of  German Kaiser Wilhelm’s visit to Turkey and sits at the far end of Sultanahmet Square in the heart of the Old City. It’s constructed in the neo-Byzantine style, with marble columns and a dome whose interior is lined with golden mosaic tiles. It’s a small but lasting tribute to an alliance that both  countries would probably rather forget. Germany and the Ottoman Empire fought on the same side in World War I after forging a secret treaty that brought the Turks into the war in 1914. Though there are few noticeable traces of World War I in modern Istanbul, the impact of its legacy is written in the very DNA of modern Turkey. The Ottoman Empire’s loss to the Allies in 1918 weakened the military significantly and paved the way for a Turkish War of Independence led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who eventually became the first President of the Turkey we know today. You could argue that this chain of events all began with a friendly visit from the Kaiser in 1898. The Ottoman Empire’s alliance with Germany and subsequent loss in World War I pretty much spelled the end for the Sultan and his friends, but this fountain still stands as a testament to their doomed alliance.

One of its heads is in the Archaeological Museum in Istanbul, its lower jaw missing - possibly because, according to the British historian Edward Gibbon, when the Ottoman Sultan took the city on May 29, 1453, he shattered it with his mace as a test of strength.

Yet, the term “ancient” does not do justice to Harran. Notably, the city is mentioned on several occasions in the Bible, but by Harran’s standards this is only recent history. In fact, the earliest mention of Harran dates back to approximately 3,000 BC, when an Eblaite princess became the Queen of Harran. Fast-forward 5,000 years, and you’ll find that history hasn’t been kind to Harran.  Reduced to a nondescript village on the border between Turkey and Syria, the area’s grandiose past can only be imagined through its ruins. What really stands out in the modern village of Harran are the clusters of primitive “beehive houses.” This is an architectural tradition that is at least 3,000 years old. Made entirely of mud or clay bricks, these buildings are designed to fence off searing heat and retain cool air. The dome-like structure topped with an opening is also functional, as hot air collects in the upper part of these houses and escapes through the aperture. The beehive shape of these abodes allows them to withstand earthquakes, violent wind storms, and seasonal heavy rains, which explains why they are still in use these days, thousands of years later. What’s more, it is relatively easy to expand the size of a beehive house by simply erecting another hive next to it and knocking an archway through. The above coordinates are for the center of Harran. You can see many beehive houses driving around the village.",weather design ancient houses homes history architecture

62,The Spoonmaker's Diamond,"Istanbul, Turkey",No one is sure if the world's fourth-largest diamond had been found in a rubbish heap or was pawned by Napoleon's mom.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-spoonmakers-diamond-istanbul-turkey,"Weighing in at 86 carats on its own, set in silver and surrounded by a dazzling array of 49 old-mine cut diamonds, the Spoonmaker’s Diamond is the literal crown jewel of Topkapi Palace Treasury. Despite receiving centuries of praise for its crystal clear color, its radiance has a mysterious quality not unlike that of a bright, full moon. As is the case with the most powerful celestial beings, perhaps it is this same unknowable, mythologized essence that also unwittingly draws viewers to gaze upon the Spoonmaker’s Diamond – for no one knows exactly how the world’s fourth-largest diamond came to reside in the heart of Istanbul’s old city, who is responsible, or from whence it arrived. The most popularly accepted version was hand-written by Rasid, the Ottoman court’s official historian, and goes something like: In the year 1669, a fisherman idly combing a rubbish heap near Eğrikapı along Istanbul’s shoreline came across a large, unusually shiny stone. Thinking it beautiful but having no idea what the piece was, he put the gem in his pocket, where it lived for a few days until he stopped by the jewelers market. Showing it to the first man he came across, the professional recognized its value but bamboozled the fisherman. According to Rasid, the Ottoman court’s official historian, the jeweler said to the man, “It’s a piece of glass, take it away if you like, or if you like I’ll give you three spoons. You brought it all the way here, at least let it be worth your trouble.” Accepting his offer as a fair payment for his time, the fisherman departed with his three spoons, and the jeweler gained the fourth-largest diamond in the world. A second, newer story has begun to emerge recently among historians, in which a French officer named Pigot purchased the diamond from India’s Maharajah of Madras in 1774. Several involved parties later, the jewel was put up for auction in Paris, where none other than Napoleon’s mother won the gem. When her son was exiled, her beloved diamond brooch was put up for sale to fund his salvation. The man who ultimately purchased the piece was a Turk in the service of Tepedelenli Ali Paşa. When the Paşa was executed by Mehmet II for suspected treason, all his jewels were absorbed by the Ottoman Treasury. No matter your preferred prelude, the first mention of the Spoonmaker’s Diamond by name appears much later than either of the above stories leaves off, reappearing during the reign of Sultan Mehmet IV in the 1800s. The hitch in proving anything more than the diamond’s incredible size and irresistible attraction is this gap in record-keeping. However, were the second, French/Indian tale somehow proved to be valid, it sets up one of the biggest coups in historic gemstone circles: that the Spoonmaker’s Diamond and the Pirot Diamond – long thought destroyed – may be one in the same. Pair these better-than-fiction origin tales with the fact that its first appearance by name describes the jewel as many carats smaller than what we know it to be (which many jewelers already suspect is a gross under-representation based on dimensions), and one thing above all becomes clear: the Spoonmaker’s Diamond is excellent at hiding her secrets behind a façade of clarity.",gems and jewels world's largest found museums and collections

He incurred the wrath of King Nimrod when he declared war on idolatry and also won the heart of the king’s daughter, Zeliha. Nimrod sentenced Abraham to death, and a huge pyre was built in the middle of the city. Miraculously, just as Abraham was tossed into the fire, the flames were transformed into water and the logs into fish. Since then, Balıklıgöl, or the Pool of Abraham, has been considered sacred, along with the carp that swim in its waters. The Pool of Ayn?-Zeliha is said to have been formed by Zeliha’s tears and it is said that anyone who eats them will be struck blind.

64,House of the Virgin Mary,"Sultaniye Köyü, Turkey",The alleged house of the Virgin Mary is tucked away in a park and nature preserve on Mt. Koressos in Turkey and is holy to both Catholics and Muslims alike.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-the-virgin-mary,"The ruins of this home are rumored to be where Mary spent her latter years, after being spirited away by John the Evangelist. Though the house has been determined by archeologists to have been built in the 6th or 7th century, it stands on the foundation of a much older structure that some believe was the home of the mother of Jesus. The plain stone house was discovered after Sister Anne Catherine Emmerich, an invalid nun who had never traveled, described her visions of it in detail to an author in 1812.  Nearly sixty years later, using that book as a guide, a French priest found the house. His discovery was not taken seriously until a decade later when 2 more missionaries found the same ruin after using the same visions as their compass. They also learned that these ruins had been revered for centuries in nearby villages, and locals had been making pilgrimages to the house and the spring near it for years. Today much of the structure has been rebuilt and a small chapel with places to leave prayers, candles, or other mementos has joined it. Pipes guide the spring into a basin where tourists and pilgrims collect the water to take home with them after their journey. It is visited year round by devout Muslims, curious skeptics, faithful Catholics and even Popes. While the Catholic church has never claimed that they believe this to be the last home of the virgin mother, they have never denied it either and have elevated its status in their faith to that of a Holy Place. Every year on August 15 (the Feast of the Assumption of Mary) Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim clergy conduct joint services at the shrine, which is an incredibly rare occurrence anywhere in the world.

65,Column of the Goths,"Istanbul, Turkey","This column celebrates Rome's victory over the Goths, and may be the oldest Roman monument in Istanbul.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/column-of-the-goths,"Standing in the outer courtyard of the Topkapi Palace, on the edge of Sarayburnu, is the Gotlar Sütunu—Column of the Goths. Surrounded by trees and ordinary park benches, one may pass by this structure without a second thought or glance. Most are unaware that this column may be one of the oldest Roman monuments in Istanbul. It’s assumed from the Latin inscription on its pedestal that the column was created to commemorate a Roman victory against the Goths. However, whether this occurred during the reign of Claudius II or Constantine I is still a matter of debate. Either way, it appears to have been constructed during the late Imperial period, around the 2nd or 3rd century. The column was carved out of a single block of Proconnesian marble. Its head ornament was designed in Corinthian style, adopting an eagle motif. According to the sign next to the monument, it stands around 60 feet (18.5 meters) tall. The column is still in great condition, but according to John Lydus, 6th century Byzantine historian, the head once bore a bust of Tyche, the Greco-Roman goddess of fortune. It’s believed that it was later removed by Christians, who may have deemed it inappropriate to keep the sculpture of a pagan deity.

66,Prinkipo Orphanage,"Adalar, Turkey","One of the largest wooden constructions in Europe was meant to be a casino, but soon became an orphanage.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prinkipo-orphanage,"Thousands of orphans have called the Prinkipo Orphanage home over the years, but the building has now stood abandoned for more than half a century. And with each day that passes, one of the largest wooden buildings in Europe comes closer to the point of collapse. In 1898, near the tail end of the Ottoman Empire, the French-Ottoman architect Alexander Vallaury began work on what was then known as the Prinkipo Palace. Located on a hilltop on Büyükada, an island in the Sea of Marmara near Istanbul, Turkey, the building was to be a luxury hotel and casino for the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, the train company that operated the Orient Express. Vallaury was an eclectic architect, unafraid of changing up his architectural approach depending on the project. And for the Prinkipo Palace, perhaps inspired by the surrounding pine forests, he went all in with wood. He built the more than 215,000-square-foot Belle Époque building entirely from timber, and for more than a century, it remained the largest wooden construction in Europe. (Depending on definitions of buildings and structures, there’s still a case to be made for Prinkipo as Europe’s largest wooden building, but the Metropol Parasol in Spain is now considered the largest wooden structure in Europe.) It was an impressive start, but then the project hit a major snag. Abdul Hamid II, the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, was a highly religious man with a fondness for massacres and secret police—but blackjack was a definite no-no. He would not allow the casino to open. So, in 1903, the wife of a wealthy Greek banker bought the building and promptly donated the entire property to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, part of the Eastern Orthodox Church. They, in turn, turned the whole place into an orphanage. At its peak, the Prinkipo Greek Orthodox Orphanage (also known as the Rum Orphanage) housed as many as 1,000 boys and was home to almost 6,000 Greek children during its lifetime. But after more than 50 years as a functioning orphanage, politics got in the way. Tensions between Turkey and Greece had been rising due to the Cyprus issue, and the orphanage was forced to close in 1964. And so began a long period of abandonment and decline. The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1980, and then the Turkish state seized the property in 1997. Later, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ordered the Turkish authorities to return the Prinkipo Orphanage to the Greek community. It was back in Greek hands, but the rot had, quite literally, set in. Istanbul’s Greek Orthodox minority was determined to restore the building, but their numbers were too small and their ability to raise funds woefully limited for such a big project. Inside the six-story building sit some 220 rooms, including a ballroom with boxes, balconies, and parquet floors, making for a monumental restoration project by any measure. It was becoming increasingly apparent that the continued existence of the Prinkipo Orphanage was in doubt. In 2012 it was included in the World Monuments Watch, and in 2018 Europa Nostra, a leading European heritage organization, placed it among 12 nominations for inclusion on the Seven Most Endangered cultural heritage sites list. As things currently stand, there are genuine fears that the Prinkipo Orphanage might not survive another winter of neglect.  The Prinkipo Orphanage sits atop a hill on Büyükada, one of the nine Princes' Islands (Kızıl Adalar) off the coast of Istanbul, Turkey. The island is about 90 minutes by ferry from Istanbul. The ferry terminal is at the northern end of Büyükada Island, and the orphanage is about a mile to the south.",woodwork abandoned architectural oddities architecture

Constructed between 1451 and 1452 by Mehmed II, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, it’s located on the European shores of the Bosphorus, often seen from afar via cruise ships. Seeking to besiege and capture Constantinople, Mehmed learned from his father’s previous attempts that naval strategies against the Byzantine fleet were crucial. He ordered the construction of a large-scale fortification that could control maritime traffic along the strait. The location Mehmed chose for this new fortress was the narrowest point on the Bosphorus, where a Roman fortification was located that was once used by the Byzantines and the Genoese as a prison. Its original name, Boğazkesen Castle, means “throat cutter” in Turkish, the “throat” referring to the Bosphorus Strait. The modern Rumeli Hisari means “the fortress in the land of the Romans,” which refers to Byzantine Europe. Likewise, the citadel constructed on the other side of the strait is named Anadoluhisari, or the Anatolian Castle. Allegedly, the layout of Rumeli Hisari was deliberately designed in the shape of the name Muhammad—both the Muslim prophet and Mehmed II himself—written in Arabic script when read from above. After the famous Fall of Constantinople in May 1453, the fortress went on to serve as a customs checkpoint, but eventually lost its strategic importance and became a prison during the 17th-century. It was partially destroyed by an earthquake of 1509, and a fire in 1746. Each time, it was immediately repaired and restored. By the 19th-century, however, the fortress had been abandoned. A residential neighborhood was then formed within the walls of Rumeli Hisari, but the inhabitants were relocated in 1953 on the order of President Celal Bayar, followed by extensive restoration work. In 1960, the fortress was reopened as a historical museum and has been so ever since, complete with an open-air theatre made for concerts.",fortresses forts castles history & culture

The largest island is home to many wonders: extravagant Ottoman architecture, quiet Greek monasteries, and the crumbling mansion where Leon Trotsky was exiled. Büyükada, or “big island,” served as a place of both exile and ecclesiastical living during the Byzantine period. In 569 CE, Byzantine Emperor Justin II constructed a palace and a monastery — the first of many monastic dwellings that would eventually serve as prisons for exiled emperors and empresses. Re-branded as a vacation hotspot during the Ottoman era, the island transformed into a lavish summer destination with notable appeal for Istanbul’s Greek, Jewish, and Armenian communities. (Many Turks preferred to summer elsewhere in the Mediterranean.) Many of the island’s ornate manors and villas that still stand today, amidst flourishing gardens and leafy fig trees, were built during this period. In 1929, the island once again became a place of exile for one man in particular: Leon Trotsky. The Marxist revolutionary lived on Büyükada for four years, penning both his autobiography and History of the Russian Revolution in his island seclusion. Trotsky’s derelict mansion still remains on the island today, and was put on the market for a whopping $4.4 million in late 2015. Perhaps the most ideal place to take in the island’s scenery, including glimpses of its ruins, is atop Yucetepe, Büyükada’s highest peak.

70,Yedi Uyurlar Mağarası (Cave of the Seven Sleepers),"Acarlar Köyü, Turkey",Seven early Christians were sealed into a cave where legend has it they slept unharmed for centuries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yedi-uyurlar-magarasi-cave-of-the-seven-sleepers,"What started as a political protest against Roman paganism became the stuff of religious legend. In January of 250, the Roman Emperor Decius issued an edict that everyone under his reign must perform a sacrifice dedicating themselves to the empire and to the Roman gods. Understandably, this caused an uproar among young Christian communities, who, though persecuted, had previously been free to worship. Refusal to submit came at the price of death. All the same, many Christians refused to deny their faiths. Seven young men in Ephesus refused to make the sacrifice and hid in a cave on the outskirts of the city. Tired from fleeing, they fell asleep. The Roman sentries came upon the Seven slumbering peacefully in the cave. Rather than killing them outright, they sealed them in, perhaps in a mockery of Christians’ reverence for Jesus’ entombment. That was the last their families and friends ever heard of them. Sometime much later, the myth continues, the farmer who owned the land thought to open the cave, perhaps to use as an animal pen. He was shocked to find seven young men inside, still asleep. When the light hit their faces, they awoke. Feeling hungry, they pooled their money and sent one of them to the village to buy food. They warned him to watch out for Romans, but, believing they had slept for a full day, they thought the coast was clear. When the young man reached the market and tried to buy bread, vendors were dismayed to see that he carried Decian coins—which were at least 150 years old by then. The bishop was called in (in the century they slept Christianity had resurfaced full force) to interview the Seven Sleepers, and they all died peacefully just a few hours after. The cave outside Ephesus was excavated in the 1920s, revealing a number of 5th and 6th century Christian graves. An ancient Church sits atop the cave as well. Religious pilgrims still pay visits to the holy Cave of the Seven Sleepers. The details of the myth are hotly disputed among the various cultures that tell it. Christians believe that the Seven slept for between 128 and 200 years, but the Qur’an states that they slept for around 300 years. Even the location is unclear. Though this cave in Ephesus is the most commonly visited by religious pilgrims, caves in Jordan, China, Tunisia, and Algeria lay claim to the myth of the Seven Sleepers.

71,Istanbul Railway Museum at Sirkeci Terminal,"Istanbul, Turkey",The legendary luxury train passage is commemorated with a charming museum inside its former eastern terminus.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/orient-express-museum-at-sirkeci-terminal,"The wondrous endpoint of the famed Orient Express exists within an operational train station in the middle of Istanbul. Hidden inside this bustling junction is a tiny, free museum dedicated to Turkish rail transport, with some mention of the Orient Express, from an age when the journey was just as important as the destination. Approaching Istanbul’s Sirkeci Station is a treat unto itself: the original, colorful stained glass rounds embedded in the building’s Oriental-Gothic façade hasn’t changed a bit since German architect August Jasmund saw to its completion in 1890. The vaulted ceilings tower above, with chandeliers dangling from their centers. Yet tucked in a corner is a modest one-room museum that pays slight homage to one of the most storied rail lines of all time: the Orient Express. Transporting the wealthiest, intrepid members of society from Paris to Istanbul starting in the Age of Exploration all the way until 1977, the Orient Express developed a prestigious reputation for luxury and class. With fabulous passengers, exquisite journeys, and spectacular destinations, it’s no wonder it took juggernauts like high speed rail and modern air travel to fell a giant like the Orient Express. When all was said and done, the folks at its former eastern terminus saw fit to build a small temple to the train’s greatness. Though only one room large, the museum we see today is a collection of baubles, with several lifetimes of stories. From the history of the line’s planning stages – replete with entertaining documents detailing negotiations such as whether the Sultan would be amenable to tracks running through his palace gardens (spoiler: he was!) – to tangible analog artifacts from the train we’ll never get to ride on, the museum covers a lot of ground in it’s small space. A mannequin sporting an original conductor’s uniform greets visitors at the door. To his right, a few pieces of fine silverware graces a faux dining car table with a diorama of European countryside painted out a window, adjacent to furniture (and a piano!) pulled from stations along the route. Displays of signage and markers surround collections of artifacts of old technology – from telegraphs and switchboards, to field telephones and watchman’s clocks – illustrating just how laborious and hands-on the process of achieving such a pinnacle of service had once been. A chopped engine has even been placed inside the room, allowing guests to stand in the engine command, turning the wheel and tinkering with the knobs while gazing out the museum’s front door at trains that actually do things. The museum’s lone attendant is on the reserved side, but full of knowledge and forthcoming once you get him going. After traveling so far in one’s mind, round out the museum visit by strolling out the door and down the platform to the Orient Express restaurant, where their traditional Turkish fare hasn’t changed a bit since the days when they served actual passengers, weary from long train journeys from Paris.",trains transportation museums and collections

Right next to the historical town of Mudurnu, which is famous for its 600-year-old mosque and traditional Ottoman houses, there are rows upon rows of turreted chateaus. The only residents are a few stray dogs and cats. Burj Al Babas is an example of development gone terribly wrong. A property developer from Dubai, the Sarot Group, had the idea to construct 732 castles, plus a shopping and entertainment center and Turkish baths from natural hot springs in one of the most beautiful parts of Turkey, not far from the Black Sea. Construction began in 2014, and they managed to more or less complete 583 castles (at a cost of $200 million) before economic disaster struck. The project was abandoned in 2019. Developers say they still plan to revive the neighborhood, which has become an attraction in its own right. But residents of Mudurnu continue to oppose the massive “white elephant” of a development.

73,The Public Toilets of Ephesus,"Selçuk, Turkey","The ancient latrines of the Greeks, in all their public glory.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ephesus-public-toilets,"The ancient city of Ephesus was one of the largest and most important in the Greco-Roman world, and the Ephesians had their fingers on the pulse of progress. The Scholastica Baths, built in 1st century CE, included the budding versions of many modern conveniences. Ephesus had advanced public works, including municipal toilets with more than a dozen marble seats in place that can still be seen (and sat on, but please don’t use) to this day. A series of 36 holes designed to handle your business stretch across three long benches, and a trough where relatively clean water would be flowing sits near your feet. Toilet paper being a fairly modern convenience in this part of the world, the trough was used to dampen your sponge on a stick (known as a “tersorium”) for personal cleansing, and then to “rinse off” said sponge. In the absence of flowing trough water, a bucket of salt water or vinegar water would be used, much to the irritation of everyone’s nether regions. The waste channels hidden within the murky innards of the city were deep for the standards of the times, between two and four meters, depending on location. It is said that if things were chilly, the high-rolling Ephesians would send enslaved people down to warm the seats. To garner use of the luxury of plumbing, one had to pay a fee to enter, and citizens enjoyed a small pool, mosaic floors, and pleasant company while socializing in the public loo.",cultures and civilizations ruins

75,Beylerbeyi Palace,"Istanbul, Turkey",This former Imperial summer home was the venue for a royal slap that once echoed 'round the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beylerbeyi-palace,"As with many centuries-old palaces, much of Beylerbeyi’s best stories have undoubtedly been lost in the mists of antiquity, but it does have a few claims to fame beyond its proximity to the first bridge to span the Bosphorus and a host of stunning architectural features. The palace is located on the Asian side of Istanbul, on the shore of the Bosphorus Strait. Built in the 1860s as an Imperial Ottoman summer residence and house for entertaining foreign heads of state, the palace has been called a masterpiece. This is due in no small part to a certain well-balanced restraint demonstrated in the structure, at least when compared to the rococo excess embodied by some of Beylerbeyi’s architectural peers. Of course, “restraint” is relative when palaces are the subject at hand. Take, for example, the fact that it only employed 5,000 men to complete, which was considered praiseworthy. Beylerbeyi was built by Sarkis Balian, a member of the Balian architectural dynasty that was responsible for other Ottoman architectural masterpieces such as the Dolmabahçe Palace, the Ortaköy Mosque, and the Cathedral of the Holy Mother of God in Gaziantep. The palace was built to impress from the water, with its most stunning façade facing the Bosphorus itself. The reception hall has a fountain and a pool inside, and most rooms feature French Baccarat chandeliers. Two marble bathing kiosks – one for the harem, and another separate pavillion just for the men of the selamlik – flank the seawall, as a large manicured garden and patch of coppice forest extend from three sides of the building. This tension between subtle opulence and insular casualness created an atmosphere ripe for dynamic human interactions as well. In one particularly amazing tale that would seem too good to be true if only it weren’t recorded in the annals of history, the Empress Eugenie of France paid a visit to the Beylerbeyi while on a tour of the region to mark the grand opening of the Suez Canal. A fleeting error in custom saw the Empress commit a serious faux pas by entering the Palace on the arm of Sultan Abdulaziz. None too pleased, the sultan’s mother issued a slap to her face that promptly notified the empress of her error. The palace also was home to a harem for entertaining guests – considered de rigueur for centuries – as was the case in 1934 when the Shah of Iran stopped by for a visit. These days Beylerbeyi’s strangest feature is a giant sculpture of a cat that seems to prowl the manicured palace grounds. Formed from metal and approximately ten times the size of Istanbul’s real-life, notoriously adorable feral felines, the Courtyard Cat throws just enough weird into the Beylerbeyi’s mix of looming regality that a visit to the waterside palace is a surefire win for any number of reasons.",palaces royalty statues architecture
76,Pinara,Turkey,"At this ancient settlement at the foot of Mount Babadağ, honeycomb tombs are carved into a round cliff.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pinara,"A veil of mystery surrounds the ancient settlement of Pinara. There are rare mentions of this location in recorded history.  One of the most reliable ones is that of Manecrates, a Lycian historian from the 4th century B.C., who reported that the town of Xanthos was experiencing overpopulation, and three settlements were under construction to help alleviate the problem. Another documented mention of Pinara relates that it fell to Alexander the Great in in 334 B.C. What is special about Pinara is its remoteness. Climbing up the hill and following a dirt road, Pinara presents itself as a set of tombs carved into a round rocky cliff. The image of a honeycomb would not be out of place as a description of the site. At the base of the cliff is a grove with a number of tombs, including the so-called Royal Tomb, with carvings showing four urban settlements. The path through the grove leads to an amphitheater and an acropolis. Climbing up closer to the cliff is another level of ruins, including another acropolis, an agora some temples, and the public baths. Some tombs exhibit scripts in Lycian and others are in Greek, testifying to the passing of civilizations.  Among the unusual features of Pinara are a heart-shaped pillar, and phalluses carved into blocks of rock used for construction, suggesting that perhaps phallic worship was practiced here. Throughout the acropolis are several sarcophagi in various degrees of neglect.  Public transport does not serve Pinara well.  It is possible to take a bus to the turn-off point at Minare, but it’s still a few kilometres to get to Pinara.  Taxis are available.  There is neither accommodation nor other facilities anywhere near Pinara, but it would make for a great camping trip.",phallic ancient greece tombs history & culture

Dating back to the 1st century CE, the Marble Road is the distinguished road that made its way by the agora to the library, the second largest in the Roman Empire. Should the ancient scholars find themselves in need of a break, there also just happened to be a hidden brothel across the way, through an underground passage. The brothel seems to have been hidden, but it was certainly no secret, as this advertisement shows. The carving features an image of a cross, a woman, a heart, a foot, a money purse, and a library, plus a hole dug into the rock. One interpretation of the carvings is as follows: up at the crossroads, on the left, you’ll find women whose love can be purchased. But please, only stop in if your foot is at least this big, young men, and you have enough coins to fill this hole. Otherwise, we kindly direct you to the library on the right.

78,Vedat Tek House,"Istanbul, Turkey",The eclectic home of a leading Turkish architect is a gorgeous piece of eye candy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vedat-tek-house,"While strolling through the streets of Istanbul, you’d be hard-pressed to miss this gorgeous house. Its odd, yet pleasing, hodgepodge of different styles gives the structure a look you won’t find elsewhere on the block. Built between 1913 and 1914 in an eclectic style, the building was named after its creator, who happened to be one of the major Turkish architects of the 20th century. Vedat Tek was one of the leading forces behind the First Turkish National Architectural Movement. The movement, which began in the early years of the Republic of Turkey, aimed to create a new form of national architecture that drew upon Seljuk and Ottoman styles. Vedat Tek’s work is scattered throughout Istanbul and beyond. He’s the mastermind behind iconic buildings like the Istanbul Main Post Office and the Kastamonu Governor’s Office. But he didn’t save his architectural flair for big-budget projects. Even the house he built for his family is a gorgeous piece of architectural eye candy. Asymmetrical in design, his family home is recognisable from afar. With its motifs of classical Turkish ornamentation and a touch of Western influence, it can be said to embrace the East and the West in equal measure, making for an aesthetically pleasing mishmash of both architecture and culture. Intricate patterns, geometric cutouts, and little pops of brilliant turquoise pigment make the building a definite stunner. In 1950, one of Vedat Tek’s son-in-laws transformed the house into a meyhane (pub). It’s still open today, letting people wine and dine within the former home of one of Turkey’s architectural greats.  A 10 to 15 minute walk from Taksim Square, the building can also be reached by bus from the same direction.",restaurants architectural oddities architecture

Discovered in 1972 by a farmer who noticed the water he would give to his crops seemed to mysteriously drain somewhere into the ground, Özkonak was found to be one of three expansive underground strongholds in the region (including Kaymaklı and Derinkuyu). Each of the cities featured multiple, stacked levels of dug out chambers connected to a shockingly sophisticated ventilation and water system. Özkonak differs from its sister cities in two important aspects however. Across Özkonak’s ten descending levels, there was a crude communication system installed so that each level could talk to the one above or below it, a feature that is unique to the city. Also unique to the city, is its system of holes just above the entrances to the city through which they could pour hot oil on any attacking forces. Medieval castles eat your heart out. Four of Özkonak’s ten floors are open to the public so that visitors can get a taste of what life’s like underground.

80,Golden Horn Chain,"Istanbul, Turkey",A section of the long chain that blocked enemy ships from entering Constantinople.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golden-horn-chain,"In the Middle Ages, the city of Constantinople, the prized capital of the Byzantine Empire, was nearly impregnable. It was surrounded by a double line of walls on land, and the strong currents of the Bosphorus Strait hindered the docking of enemy ships. However, there was a weak point: the calm waters of the Golden Horn. The Golden Horn is a vaguely horn-shaped estuary that leads right into the heart of the city. This quiet anchorage would have allowed enemies’ ships to advance into a position where they could order an attack on both sides of the city. The solution to this problem was to stretch a long iron chain across the vulnerable waterway. This defensive chain, estimated to date to around the 8th century, was extended from a secured tower just east of Topkapi Palace on the south bank to another point in a lost fortress on the north side of the city (where the Yeralti Camii underground mosque is located today). At first, the chain was floated on wooden floats or barrels. Later, a mechanism was installed so that it could be raised to allow the passage of friendly ships. Scholars believe that after the Turkish conquest of the city, the chain was placed in storage somewhere in the newly named Istanbul, and eventually, parts of it were given to various museums in the city to preserve. One section of the chain is now displayed in the Istanbul Archeological Museum. Next to the section, there is a modern painting (itself based on an engraving from 1493), which depicts the city walls and the monumental buildings within, as well as the formidable chain that closed the entrance to the Golden Horn.  The museum recommends visiting via public transit as there is no parking lot at the museum. By tram, take Line T-1 to Gülhane istasyonu station.

81,Museum of Energy,"Istanbul, Turkey",This shuttered power plant is now Turkey's first industrial archaeology museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-energy,"Though it no longer helps power the city, this old station still generates a fair amount of buzz. Instead of letting the plant fall into disrepair and decay after it was shut down, it was decided to transform its first two engine rooms into a museum dedicated to the very thing the station once produced. Before it became Turkey’s first industrial archaeology museum, the Silahtarağa Power Station sent electricity surging through the city from 1914 to 1983. Much of the machinery has been cleaned up and restored, so the museum looks like the station did when it was actually in use. One of the most impressive sights to see is the control room where the electricity was transmitted to different areas in Istanbul. This room and its many control devices and equipment were kept intact, making it easy to imagine it could whirr to life at any moment and once again and send energy coursing through the city. On the ground floor, people can peruse a number of hands-on exhibits that show how energy works. Called the Energy Play Zone, its 22 exhibits let curious visitors have a bit of fun with generating electricity, crafting magnetic sculptures, and playing around with touching different (harmless) electrical charges.",energy power stations machines industrial technology museums
82,Fortress of Kızkalesi,"Mersin Province, Turkey",Mediterranean castle on a tiny Turkish island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kizkalesi-fortes,"According to legend, the Fortress of Kızkalesi was built by a sultan to protect his daughter, who was supposed to die by snakebite. Tragically, a snake snuck into the castle walls in a fruit basket, and even the massive fortress could not protect her and she died. Despite failing to protect the princess, the walls served as fortifications for many others over the years, including the Armenian Kings who built the fortifications in the 12th century, along with vicious Mediterranean pirates. The Fortress of Kızkalesi is so large, and its accompanying island is so small that it appears to float improbably on top of the water. However, this is only a recent development, as the castle was once connected to the land and another castle on the shore by a causeway. When a nearby dam broke and caused flooding, the causeway was submerged, and the fortress was rendered an island fortification. Although it was used sporadically throughout the late medieval period, the fortress eventually fell into disrepair. Despite its glorious history, the island remains a puzzling and visually-stunning ruin today and is slowly decaying under the forces of weather and time.",fortresses outsider architecture castles architectural oddities architecture
83,Hasankeyf,"Hasankeyf, Turkey",This ancient city - home to nine civilizations - is soon to be buried under 200 feet of water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hasankeyf,"The settlement of Hasankeyf in southeastern Turkey has been continuously inhabited for nearly 12,000 years, its location near the river Tigris making it a key prize for the great civilizations of Mesopotamia. Modern civilization, however, has left its days numbered. The first inhabitants of Hasankeyf were cliff dwellers, who settled in the caves along the rock face of the Raman Mountains. Over the following millennia, the Assyrians, Romans, Byzantines, Mongols, and Ottomans would cycle through these lands, leaving behind their bridges, palaces, and temples. Few ancient cities can lay claim to such a wealth of history. And, although the city’s crumbling mausoleums and teetering minarets make an obvious claim to the past, even more secrets of antiquity still remain underground, a treasure trove of archeological potential. Hasankeyf’s fate, however, has been sealed by the encroachment of the Ilisu Dam, a massive engineering project that will create a 121-square-mile reservoir. As a result, water levels in Hasankeyf are expected to rise by 200 feet (enough to reach the upper balcony of the famed minaret). While the dam project will provide much-needed jobs and generate nearly 2 percent of Turkey’s electricity supply, it has fallen out of favor with the international establishment due to the impending displacement of people living in the region and the inundation of cultural sites like Hasankeyf. However, although international funding for the dam was pulled in 2008, construction has continued with the support of several large Turkish banks. There are plans to relocate about a dozen monuments in the city before the tide comes in, but much of what remains to be discovered will certainly be lost. Those planning a visit are advised to make it soon.  The Ilısu Dam was completed in 2020 and the town is now completely overflooded.",silk road ancient ruins
84,Theodosian Wall Stone Ladder,"Istanbul, Turkey",Climb a set of vertiginous stone steps to the top of this impressive ancient edifice.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/theodosian-wall-stone-ladder,"When Emperor Theodosius II pitched his battlement plan in the early fifth century, it was to protect Constantinople from the likes of Attila the Hun.  Today, visitors need not bring a horde of Visigoths to scale the Theodosian Wall, but a degree of intrepidity is helpful in scurrying to the top via this precarious stone ladder. In 324, Constantine I founded Constantinople on the site of the old city of Byzantium as the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. With increasing instability throughout the old empire, successive emperors sought to protect the city from invasions from the west and north, and in 404, the Theodosian Wall was begun. The wall took nine years to build and it is nearly 4 miles long, stretching from the Golden Horn to the Sea of Marmara. The fortification is actually two walls with a moat, and is strengthened by 96 towers, each reaching some 60 feet tall, while the inner wall is approximately 15 feet thick. Walking the wall is a popular activity for tourists, both along its base and atop the rampart. There are many easier access points than the stone ladder, but none as thrilling. And the panoramic view of Istanbul at the top is well worth the scramble. Over the centuries, the walls have suffered significant damage as a result of frequent earthquakes, and with the dawn of modern warfare, they proved to be an obsolete defense against new technologies like the cannon. But nevertheless, the medieval walls were effective at protecting the capital of the Byzantine Empire for 1,000 years.  To find this stone ladder, walk west to the wall from Chora Church, climb to the top level, and follow the wall south to the steep steps that lead to the top of the tower. There are no railings on this segment of the wall making for a vertiginous experience at the top. Other hazards include mobs of adorable children in the Chora Church neighborhood who beg or offer to sell trinkets to tourists, all in an effort to distract from their expert pickpocketing.

It contains a balbale that is thought to be the oldest love poem ever found, known by the title Bridegroom, Spend the Night in Our House Till Dawn. Unearthed at the archaeological site of Nippur during the late 1880s, the poem is a monologue directed to Shu-Sin, king of the Neo-Sumerian Empire. It’s told from the perspective of a female speaker, who expresses her intense longing for the king in an erotic manner. A theory has suggested that the poem may have been sung at the yearly rite of “sacred marriage” or hierogamy. During this event, the king would symbolically marry Inanna, the goddess of fertility, love and war, to ensure the next year’s prosperity.",mesopotamia artifacts ancient
86,Pera Palace Hotel,"Istanbul, Turkey",This historic hotel preserves many treasures from its heyday hosting passengers on the Orient Express.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pera-palace-hotel,"The luxurious Pera Palace Hotel, the oldest European hotel in Istanbul, was built in the 19th century to host passengers traveling east on the famous Orient Express. Its rooms have housed such prominent figures as Ernest Hemingway, King Edward VII of England, Alfred Hitchcock, and Jackie Kennedy. Today, some rooms are preserved to look just as they did when they hosted these prestigious guests. One very interesting example is Room 101, which was stayed in by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey. The room preserves the old furniture and decoration from Atatürk’s stay in 1917, and some of the president’s personal belongings. One of these is an old clock whose hands stopped ticking exactly at the moment of Atatürk’s death. Room 411 is better known as the Agatha Christie room, and it is one of the most requested rooms at the hotel. The Queen of Crime stayed in this particular room several times between the years 1926 and 1932, reportedly while writing one of her most famous novels, Murder on the Orient Express. Several urban legends tell that during the 11 days when the writer went missing, she was here at the Pera Palace Hotel. Located in Istanbul’s “Little Europe” district, Beyoğlu, the hotel’s exterior combines elements of art nouveau with oriental and neoclassical style. For many years, guests arriving in the city via the luxury passenger train would stay at this hotel, which is why both it and the train have the same symbol, a crest of golden lions. The historic elevator can still be seen inside the hotel, with its curious structure of wood and wrought iron and the unmistakable arrow that indicated the floors.

It’s carved into a niche within a cliff on Mount Sipylus, and is so weathered and eroded it looks as though it’s in danger of crumbling from existence at any second. If you look at the cliff closely, you can see the faded shape of a seated human sculpted into the granite. The figure wears what looks like a tall headdress, though over the centuries, the elements have gnawed away much of its head. Its arms rest across its chest, and its feet lie atop a stool. Not much is known about the mysterious artwork. Because of the hieroglyphics next to the figure, it’s believed to have been created by the Hittites, an ancient Anatolian civilization whose empire peaked in the 14th-century BC. Rock reliefs are fairly common within Hittite religious art. As such, it’s thought this relief depicts a deity of some sort. Pausanias, the second-century Greek geographer, wrote that it depicted Cybele, the Anatolian mother goddess.

What is today an archaeological site filled with ancient buildings was once the grand capital of the kingdom of Lydia. The Lydian kingdom flourished in the Iron Age, until it was conquered by Cyrus the Great, king of Achaemenid Persia, in 546 B.C. Two centuries later, Sardis surrendered to Alexander the Great, then fell into the hands of the Romans, and then was conquered by the Byzantine Empire. A rivalry with the Seljuk Turks followed, around which time the city’s decline began. In 1402, when the city was captured by the Turco-Mongol warlord Timur (also known as Tamerlane), it had been all but destroyed and was left to ruin until archaeological excavations began in the 19th century. Lydia was one of the most industrially advanced countries in Asia Minor, and its capital served as a center of manufacturing. It is believed that the idea of metal coinage was invented here around the 6th century B.C., during the reign of King Alyattes. Electrum—a naturally-occurring alloy of gold and silver—has been found in the area, and it is believe that dust or small pieces of this alloy was exchanged for goods and services. There are some arguments against this theory due to its ambiguity, but it is generally accepted as told by Herodotus in his Histories. According to Herodotus, Lydia was also among the first to establish retail shops in permanent locations. The earliest solid gold coins were known to the ancient Greek world as “Croeseids,” after the King Croesus, the son of Alyattes, the Lydian king who introduced them. Earlier coins had been made exclusively of the  electrum, but Croesus is credited with issuing this coinage after his metallurgists were able to separate the gold and silver components that make up electrum.",metallurgy iron age coins gold money ancient ruins
89,Basilica of St. John,"Selçuk, Turkey",This crumbling medieval basilica once attracted pilgrims by the thousands to collect a miraculous dust that formed above the saint's tomb.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/basilica-of-st-john,"The early Christian community in the ancient port city of Ephesus traced its origins to the apostle and evangelist St. John, the so-called Beloved Disciple. According to church tradition, John wrote his gospel in Ephesus, and, after a period of exile on the island of Patmos during which time he wrote the Book of Revelation, returned there and died. An apocryphal tale claims that John’s prayers shattered Ephesus’ Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Ironically, the 6th-century basilica dedicated to St. John, built in Ephesus by the Emperor Justinian, would become one of the wonders of the medieval world. Built on the supposed site of the saint’s tomb, the church formed part of a building program that included the massive Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the Basilica of Sant’Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna. In its medieval heyday, the basilica was a major pilgrimage site, sitting directly on the overland route to the Holy Land. The architectural icon of St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice copied the design of St. John’s, which like its Venetian counterpart was lined with gold mosaics depicting saints and gospel stories. Now-lost relics once held in the basilica included a piece of the True Cross that John carried around his neck, a garment worn by the saint made by the Virgin Mary, and the original manuscript of John’s Book of Revelation. The church’s major attraction was, of course, St. John’s tomb, and its marble encasement is still visible today. An old story relates that when the saint’s tomb was opened by Constantine, no relics were found, attesting to the saint’s miraculous assumption into heaven. Another account claimed the saint was sleeping beneath the tomb, and his breath stirred a fine ash, called manna, to form upon the tomb. This latter tale attracted thousands of pilgrims to the tomb each year on the saint’s feast day, May 8, to collect some of the holy manna for themselves. One of these pilgrims was the 13th/14th-century Catalan mercenary Ramon Muntaner, who claimed to have personally witnessed the ash bubbling up over the tomb. He wrote that the manna could cure both fevers and gallstones, that it could calm a storm when tossed in the sea, and could induce birth in a woman when consumed with wine. Today most tourists stroll past the remains of St. John’s basilica on the way up scenic Ayasuluk Hill and its imposing Byzantine-Turkish fortress. Piles of brick and marble, crumbling columns and wayward capitals sketch a skeleton outline of what was once one of the most sumptuous houses of worship in the world. After the Oghuz Turks conquered Ephesus in the 14th century, the church was briefly converted to a mosque—soon earthquakes forced the abandonment of the crumbling relic.  The basilica is a short walk from the center of Selçuk. The entrance is off St. Jean Caddesi. The site is open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. April to October and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. November to March.",basilicas biblical saints christianity tombs ancient religion churches sacred spaces ruins
90,Yeralti Camii (Underground Mosque),"Istanbul, Turkey",A surprising and unconventional mosque hidden in the subsoil of Istanbul.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yeralti-camii-underground-mosque,"Hidden among the alleyways of the Karaköy harbor there is an amazing Ottoman mosque that, in stark contrast to the great height of most Islamic temples in Istanbul, is situated sunken into the earth. For this reason it was dubbed the “Underground Mosque,” or  “Yeralti Camii” in Turkish. The easy-to-miss mosque is accessed from two entrances at street level, which lead to a short tunnel down into the earth. The ceiling is very low and the space is dark, illuminated with just a few lamps and some strident green fluorescents that illuminate the ancient tombs of two Arab martyrs. The unusual mosque has a storied history. It’s believed that back when the Galata neighborhood was a Genoese settlement, the site was a Byzantine fort. The basement of the fort supposedly held the enormous chain that protected the Byzantine fleet from Turkish attacks by blocking ships from entering the Golden Horn waterway into the city. After the Ottoman conquest, the subterranean site was used for ammunition storage until, in 1640, a religious leader of the Nakşibendi sect discovered the bodies of two Arab martyrs inside. It’s believed the soldiers participated in the failed Arab siege of Constantinople in the 7th century. It is said the Arab army interred their dead here after the attempted siege, along with valuable items locked in a vault sealed with lead. You can see the graves of the martyrs situated near of the back entrance of the mosque today, and off to the side is a gated room bearing two side-by-side tombs bathed in green light where the bodies supposedly rest. The subterranean space was eventually converted into a mosque under the auspices of Grand Vizier Bahir Mustafa Paşa in 1757. The building, which for a long time even lacked a minaret, has two entrances at street level that allow access to the site below. When visiting this unusual mosque you seem to move between the shadows as a result of the near absence of natural light. In summer it is not strange to find people napping inside.  The mosque is located in Karaköy near Galata Bridge. It's accessible by Tram (T-1) and tube (Tünel) in Karaköy station. By Bus, take lines 26, 28, 30, 35, 66, or 82. It's also reachable by ferry, just a short walk from Karaköy terminal.

91,Nazaretian House,"Gaziantep, Turkey",A beautiful 19th-century Armenian mansion is preserved above an unassuming cafe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nazaretian-house,"Built in the mid-1800s, the Nazaretian House is the former residence of a wealthy Armenian family. It’s located in the oldest neighborhood of Gaziantep, currently known as Bey Mahallesi. In the 17th and 18th centuries this part of Gaziantep was known as Ayntab and was home to an affluent Armenian community, the Nazaretians being one of the wealthiest families. Today, part of the Nazaretian House has been restored and serves as a cafe, with tables in the courtyard. But the left side has been left untouched, preserving all the beautiful details of the 150-year-old manse, despite being in a state of disrepair. Located above an unassuming cafe, this place is not found in most tourist guides, making it a hidden gem of the city. Inside the building, you’ll find the old Armenian script welcoming visitors, who are free to explore the three different rooms upstairs. One room has a huge dome decorated with angels, and portrait photos hang on the walls, while the most beautiful room is decorated with stunning paintings and four angels at every corner.  The house is located in the Bey Mahallesi district of Gaziantep.

92,Tlos,"Fethiye, Turkey",One of the most exquisite Lycian hilltop citadels in Turkey.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tlos,"One of the six most important Lycian cities, Tlos was described in the Hittite Chronicle as “the most brilliant metropolis of the Lycian nation.” Although most Lycian cities were located along the coast, Tlos was strategically placed on a hill commanding expansive views of Xanthos Valley to the west and protected by the Akdag mountains to the east. The actual hill on which Tlos is perched is further secured by near-vertical slopes on three sides, making it a natural fortress. Evidence suggests that Tlos was inhabited 4,000 years ago, but the site was not abandoned until the 19th-century. The impressive longevity of the location means that Tlos was home to several disparate cultures, all leaving their mark on the acropolis and nearby area. The Kanlı Ağı fort at the very top of the hill is Ottoman, but even this relatively recent construction incorporated pre-existing Lycian and Roman walls. Directly below the fort are Lycian tombs, traditionally carved into the side of the rocky outcrop, and directly outside these tombs are several sarcophagi. To the right of the entrance, a path leads to the base of the hill. After a steep descent and ascent, a cluster of tombs can be seen from the path. It takes some climbing to reach the most important tomb of Tlos: the Tomb of Bellerophon (Tomb no. 1). According to the legend, an ancient Lycian king sent Bellerophon to kill Chimaera. Upon his departure, Athena gifted Pegasus to Bellerophon. Fittingly, on a wall of the tomb, Bellerophon is depicted in full fighting gear riding a winged horse. Not far from the Tomb of Bellerophon is Tomb no. 5, above which is an interesting bas-relief portraying ten fighting warriors. Beside the acropolis is the stadium. The wide expanse of land between the ruins is a modest reminder of how massive this stadium was. The only visible remains of the stadium are the seats that could accommodate 2,500 spectators and the pool that sits in the center of the stadium. On the north side of the stadium are the two baths, the gymnasium, and the amphitheater, flanked by buildings that are believed to have hosted the local market.",
93,Buried Village of Al Madam,"Al Madam, United Arab Emirates",An abandoned desert hamlet swallowed up by sand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buried-village-of-al-madam,"On a strip of desert behind the town of Al Madam lies a tiny ghost village lost in sand. It consists of two rows of colorful houses and a mosque at one end, all long-deserted and engulfed by the dunes. There is something poetic in the way nature has taken over these old abandoned buildings, and something eerie as well. The small houses have rusty iron gates, and inside are colorful blue and green rooms decorated with ceramic tiles and wallpapers. Each room is filled with piles of sand, sometimes stretching halfway up the walls, pocked with scorpion footprints all over. Local legend holds that it was the jinns—supernatural creatures that Arabs and Muslims believe exist in a plane invisible to humans—who drove the people away from their village. The settlement was likely first built in the 1970s or ’80s and inhabited by the local Al Kutbi tribe. It was abandoned not long afterward. Though this strange and silent place does indeed feel haunted, in reality, it was almost certainly the encroaching desert that drove residents from their homes. Today the little lost hamlet is referred to by locals either as the “old village,” “ghost village,” or “buried village” of Al Madam. Some buildings are now entirely inside the dunes and have windows on the roof, so explorers should take care where they step.  The buried village can be found from Google Maps by the name ""The old area of Madame."" It's about 37 miles from Dubai. There is no public transportation to take you there, so a taxi is a good option. It's about 300 dirhams there and back from Dubai. It's good to tell the driver that the road near the village is sandy desert road. You can use the small sand road that is marked on Google Maps, and turns from Umm al quwain AI Shuwaid RD. There are also some abandoned shops and building sites near the village. The dunes around the village are also very beautiful.",dunes deserts ghost towns abandoned

As yet another grandiose project proving that Dubai can support any endeavor the rest of the world can and bigger, the recently opened Miracle Garden may be the city’s most ambitious undertaking yet. Planted on over 775,000 square feet of land, the garden creates massive designs and shapes using fields and flowerbeds using a seemingly impossible 45 million separate flowers. The miraculous growing project is especially impressive in that it exists in Dubai’s harsh desert climate. The caretakers of the garden claim that the growth is possible through the careful re-use of wastewater and irrigation that uses the drip method as opposed to a more wasteful spray method. No matter how it is achieved, the staggeringly colorful fields of blooms, shaped like hearts and igloos, and built up trellises constructed to look like famous building, seem like something out of a fairy tale. This effect is undoubtedly intentional, perfectly accenting the other fantastically over-the-top projects that have come to define the city. The Dubai Miracle Garden is not yet finished either.

95,The World Islands,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",This artificial archipelago was supposed to resemble a map of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-islands,"Dubai is famous for its luxurious Palm Islands, the easily recognizable manmade archipelago off of the city’s coast. Based on the Palm’s success, Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Maktoum, envisioned an even bolder archipelago project in 2003: a group of islands shaped like a map of the world. Unlike the Palm Islands, however, it seems the World Islands may have been a disaster of global proportions. Construction of the World Islands began in September of 2003. Requiring 321 million cubic meters of sand—about the volume of 150 Major League Baseball stadiums, up to the top of the foul poles and including the stands—the World Islands cost over $14 billion to build. With one island for every country (excluding Israel), the World Islands together covered over 20 square miles of the Persian Gulf. Located just three miles off the coast of Dubai, the 300 islands that made up the World Islands are supposed to resemble a world map when viewed from above. Unfortunately for the islands’ developers, the archipelago turned out to be only vaguely recognizable. Due to weathering, sinking, and erosion, the World Islands have lost their well-defined borders. Central America is practically nonexistent, Australia is awkwardly made up of five rectangular strips of sand, and Europe, Africa, and Asia have merged into a largely indistinguishable blob. In addition to the aesthetic problem, the World Islands don’t have a reliable source of electricity, as the plan to install electric cables under the Persian Gulf has fallen flat. For these reasons, 291 of the 300 World Islands have been left undeveloped and to this day remain nothing but sand. Even though 60% of the islands were sold to private companies and investors by 2008, after eight years nearly all have remained untouched. As of 2016, only nine of the islands have been developed: Lebanon Island, Pete’s Island, the six islands making up the “Heart of Europe” resort, and Island Michael Schumacher (named after the seven-time Formula One World Champion). The entire continents of Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America remain entirely uninhabited blotches of sand.",earth resorts islands
96,Elephant Clock,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",A faithful reproduction of Al-Jazari's enormous water clock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-clock,"Built over five months to exacting diagrams in an original 13th century manuscript, the elaborate elephant-shaped water clock at the Ibn Battuta mall in Dubai is a tribute to 800 year old engineering brilliance. The Elephant clock was only one of many ingenious devices designed by the polymath inventor Al-Jazari (full name: Badi Al-Zaman Abu Al-Izz Ismail Bin Al-Razzaz Al-Jazari), who worked as chief engineer for the Artuklu Palace, now in Turkey, in the middle-ages. In his famous manuscript, known in English as the Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, published in 1206, Al-Jazari described in detail 50 machines of varying complexity, illustrated with beautiful color miniatures. His work and book are different from a lot or early treatises on mechanical contraptions in that he was a gifted mechanic, and the book is more of a practical guide than merely a theoretical book of engineering concepts. His instructions included devices like automatic gates and doors, animal and humanoid automata, and clocks. It was the clocks for which he would become most famous. These were more than just mechanical toys. The complexity of his 11 foot Castle astronomical clock is so complex, it is considered to be an example of an early programmable analog computer. Timekeeping had special role in the Muslim faith, allowing followers to more accurately know the five times for prayer in the absence of a call to prayer. In Al-Jazari’s time, the Islamic empire had reached new heights, covering most of North Africa, Europe, and Asia. The technology of simple water clocks dates back to Babylonia, Ancient Egypt, and Greece, and less complicated examples of water clocks were used throughout the Muslim world to help keep time. The Elephant clock is different from these, both in its elaborate form and function. The physical details of his clock represent different cultures: The elephant is an Asian elephant which represents India, the dragon-like serpent represents China, the phoenix at the top represents ancient Egypt, and the turbaned figure represents Muslim cultures. The internal mechanisms of the clock, driven by floats in water tanks hidden in the belly of the elephant, activate the various components into mechanical motion every half hour. The 3.5 million square foot mall, in which the elephant clock can be found is named for the 14th century explorer Ibn Battuta. The mall is divided into themed sections, each taking visual inspiration from various lands visited by Battuta. The Elephant clock is located in the India Court portion. The full-size working reproduction was commissioned for the 2005 opening of the mall, and carried out by the U.K.-based Foundation for Science, Technology and Civilization (FSTC), who consulted on the design of the decor. The FSTC is dedicated to disseminating information about Muslim history and culture. According to mall publications, there are plans to re-create his famous Castle Clock as well. There are at least three other examples of reconstructions of the Elephant Clock, including one outside the Musee d’Horlogerie du Locle, Chateau des Monts, in Le Locle, Switzerland, and one at the Institute for the History of Arab-Islamic Science in Frankfurt, Germany. The newest, 20 foot tall, Elephant clock is on display at the London  Science Museum through April 2010 as part of the exhibit 1001 Inventions, dedicated to the history of Muslim science and technology.

Since snow is kind of hard to come by in Dubai, they went ahead and just built a snowy mountain inside of their giant mall. Contained entirely indoors, the one-stop winter resort pulls out all the stops to help people pretend they aren’t in a desert where temperatures can climb to above 120 degrees. The main attraction is the 279-foot “mountain” that looks strangely impressive even from the outside. The artificial geological feature has multiple ski runs including the world’s first indoor black diamond rated course. If skiing or snowboarding isn’t your thing, there are also all sorts of other attractions like toboggans and even a place for you to meet penguins. The temperature in the facility is maintained at a crisp 30 degrees during operation thanks to a sophisticated insulation system that counteracts the sun’s best efforts. The temperature is dropped in the evening so that they can make fresh new snow for their unnatural resort. As with many things in Dubai, just because it seems like it shouldn’t be, doesn’t mean won’t be, and Ski Dubai is no exception. The concept of a ski resort in that part of the world is foreign enough that each entrance fee includes rental of coats and snow gear, because there is no reasonable reason to have such things otherwise.

That’s right—a fully functional city that emits not one ounce of greenhouse gas. They began with a down payment of $22 billion dollars, and with it they built a central plaza of modern terracotta buildings, complete with an Arab texture, to house up to 1500 green energy businesses. The city was built for 50,000 workers living within the city limits, plus an additional 60,000 from the surrounding areas, with the majority of them working towards a clean energy future. With this planned excess of clean energy, the operators of Masdar City devised contraptions that would take hot desert air from the sky and convert it to cool ground air, making Masdar City up to 20ºC cooler than the adjacent Abu Dhabi. This clean energy was also going to be used to power a 100%-green transportation grid. This transit system is made up of electrically-powered Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) vehicles, which are pods that circulate the city’s underground and are free for all residents to use. They were to offer nonstop transit for three to six people from Point A to Point B. Besides the PRT system, the city also caters to pedestrians and cyclists, and the only cars allowed in are electric ones. To further reduce waste, movement sensors have been integrated into the city to replace water taps and light switches, which reduces water and energy consumption by over 50% each. Just like that, Masdar City became the first carbon neutral city to ever be built in the entire world. Except for one thing: it was never finished. The original plan was to have the city fully completed by 2016. But due to the global financial crisis of the late 2000s, the project has stalled, and current estimates have it being completed by 2030—a deadline extension of nearly 250%. As of today, only 5% of the original “greenprint” has been fully constructed. Today’s Masdar City is like a green ghost city. Except, not even that green. After the mission was declared a failure, the planning directors decided to abandon the zero carbon idea, and are currently building the rest of the city to be 50% carbon-neutral.",utopia week urban planning climate change ghost towns

Three years later, the impressive building that had cost $545 million to create, finally opened its doors to the public. With a capacity for 40,000 worshippers, it is one of the largest mosques in the world. However, its size alone is not its most amazing characteristic. Inside the prayer hall is the world’s largest carpet, weighing in at 35 tons and covering 60,000 square feet. With over 2.3 billion knots, the carpet represents the grand effort of the mosque.

The luxurious Burj Al Arab experience begins even before entering the hotel. Hotel guests are greeted at Dubai International Airport by their choice of a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce or a lift from a helicopter. Those who choose the latter will land on a helipad suspended at the very top of the hotel, a platform that was converted to a tennis court in 2005 to host an epic match between Andre Agassi and Roger Federer. Once guests enter the hotel, the over-the-top extravagance becomes even more amplified. One of sixteen elevators will bring guests to the lobby, built with 258,000 square feet of Statuario marble.

So it should come as no surprise that one of the biggest gold markets in the world is in Dubai, the country’s largest city. Known as a souk, this sprawling bazaar of gold traders, diamond merchants, and jewelers loops through a series of galleries, covered at the top but still retaining the flavor of an open-air market. What is offered is scrupulously regulated by the UAE government, ensuring authenticity—something mostly lacking from the street vendors outside. What is not regulated is the price, which makes haggling an integral part of the experience. If it’s true that this is the market where skilled hagglers can find the best deals in the world—not only on gold, but on platinum, silver, and gems as well—there are over 300 outlets to test the hypothesis. At its inception in the early 1900s there were only a handful of local jewelers. It grew considerably in the 1940s when new trade policies encouraged Iranian and Indian entrepreneurs to set up shop, but it was the oil boom of the 1970s that made the Dubai Gold Souk the icon it is today. The market has undergone a process of expansion and gentrification through the years, but it has managed to retain the charm and atmosphere of an Arabian souk. It’s said that no less than 10 tons of gold are spread across the vendors on any given day—a claim that’s tough to prove, but hard to dispute.  The Gold Souk is in the Deira section of Dubai, and it is open seven days a week from 10am to 10pm except Friday, when it doesn't open until 4pm.

From beneath footsteps and car wheels, a deep roaring tone comes from the sand. The sound has been compared to the low note of the didgeridoo or a low-flying plane. In the 1200s, Marco Polo, in his journeys through the dunes of China, said he was struck by “the sounds of all kinds of musical instruments,” and also “of drums and the clash of arms.” The phenomenon is caused by the vibrations of the grains of sand as they fall on top of each other. The study of it is new, however, and physicists debate the model that most accurately describes the mechanism. Thirty locations worldwide, including ones in China and the US, have singing sand, but none, experts say, has as pronounced and mellifluous a sound as the giant dunes in the south of the United Arab Emirates. This area is known as the Empty Quarter and stretches into Saudi Arabia. Local guides—who you will need if want to avoid getting lost in the tessellating sands, which can bewilder and quickly kill visitors—can take you to see and hear these mysterious dunes.

It’s the oldest extant mosque in the United Arab Emirates. Al Bidya is thought to date back to 1446, when it was built into the hillside between the Gulf and the Hajar Mountains, though new research proposes it may be over a century younger than originally believed. Because it’s made entirely of mud and stone, radiocarbon dating a precise age is impossible. The mosque is located near the village of Al Bidya in the east coast emirate of Fujairah. Its origins largely remain a mystery. Even local elders reportedly know little about its early history. Al Bidya is uniquely built, mainly because it has fewer domes than other mosques. It has four layered domes, each containing a central pillar to support the structure. While it now has modern lighting and air conditioning, the worn minbar (pulpit), niches for decoration or lighting, and tiny windows for lighting and ventilation echo to a bygone era.

Look north, and you’ll see Dubai’s older, more historic neighborhoods framed within the great shiny structure. Look south, and you’ll see the modern, glitzy buildings and flashy skyscrapers for which the city is so famous. You can do more than look through the massive frame. The glass, aluminum, steel, and reinforced concrete structure also doubles as an observation tower that boasts fantastic panoramic vistas. It stands 492 feet (150 meters) tall, basically giving you a birds-eye view of the bustling metropolitan hub that sprawls below it. Unfortunately, the frame is as controversial as it is impressive. Its design was the idea of architect Fernando Donis, who won an international competition held by the Dubai government. Though his idea (with a few tweaks) was chosen for the now-iconic landmark, Donis maintains he did not receive a contract or payment for his work, and sued the municipality for stealing his intellectual property.  It's a royal pain to get there if you're driving, as the roads are confusing around the park. The Dubai Frame is open all year round, including weekends and public holidays.

The cluster of domed structures and has been classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. More than 500 of these tombs sit at the foot of Jebel Hafeet mountain. They look like small stone igloos baking in the Sun. Incredibly, some of the tombs still contain skeletal remains. These tombs and architectural remains are significant, as they are a rare and unique illustration of human development in the Bronze Age and the Iron Age on the Arabian Peninsula. The drive alone to get to the tombs is an adventure in itself. Although Jebel Hafeet mountain is accessible on the United Arab Emirates side via an excellently maintained road, the tombs are off-road.  Drive toward the Mezyad Oman border post. Exit the first right at the roundabout toward the Oasis International School. The road will become a dirt road. Drive along until you come to some camel farms. At the farms, turn right and then follow the vague tracks in the sand toward the mountain. Eventually, after some rocky terrain, you will see the tombs ahead.

Constructed during the 16th-century, this fort is best remembered for the significant role it played in resisting colonial expansion. The fort covers an area of 610 square meters and was mainly constructed using local materials such as rock, gravel, and mortar. The rest of the structure is supported by mangrove poles and its roof is composed of palm fronds and trunks. From 1808 to 1810, the fort was occupied by Wahabbists. More than a century later, the British navy destroyed three of the fort’s towers in 1925, resulting in the structure’s subsequent abandonment. The castle remained untouched until 1997, when the Fujairah Administration of Antiquity made it their mission to restore the site to its former glory. The restoration process lasted three years and opened to visitors once again in 2000. Today, the Fujairah Fort offers visitors a glimpse into an ancient past filled with challenging obstacles, while also providing spectacular views of the city.  Entry into the fort is free. Just down the road from the fort lies the Fujairah Museum, but also the Fujairah Heritage Village. Both of these establishments offer a quaint but valuable insight into the history of Fujairah.",forts war history military history & culture architecture

It’s the largest sand hill in the country, and one of the largest in the world. Moreeb stands at a staggering 5,250 feet long, 984 feet high, and has a 50 degree slope. This steep incline makes the area perfect for the organized dune races that occur throughout the year. It’s also the home of a massive hill climbing competition every February. A cultural complex at the base hosts events and is a popular destination, even among those who don’t plan to actually make the trek up to the top of the dune. Visitors are welcome to try to climb Moreeb, but it is not an easy task. The view from the sandy summit is well worth the exertion.

111,Al Wathba Fossil Dunes,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",These otherworldly formations were shaped over millions of years by the forces of nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-wathba-fossil-dunes-formations,"Al Wathba fossil dunes are a little-known attraction on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi. With the huge sun setting in the distance, the vast desert feels like a scene from any of the “Star Wars” films. These petrified fossil dunes are smaller than they appear in pictures. A few million years ago, when the area was covered by water, eroded sediments settled at the bottom of these bodies of water. Over time, the fine-grained sand was covered by other layers of sediment. The layers became compacted and cemented together by different minerals, mostly salt crystals, into stable structures. The formations got their shape from the interplay of wind strength and sediment supply. Despite relatively consistent prevailing wind directions in present-day United Arab Emirates, dune patterns and alignments vary considerably from area to area. This allows geologists to better understand the history of the land-forms and rock formations. These dune patterns are like works of art, each containing its own unique shape. The location is a great spot for a picnic during the early morning hours, and the evening is great for camping. The sand formations are extremely fragile, some have already fell victim to human negligence, so please make sure you appreciate them from a distance and don’t climb on on this natural wonder.  After a 30 minute drive on E30, you will reach a scantily populated, industrial area; past a sewerage plant, just behind Al Dhafra Military Air Base. The dunes are located slightly off-road, they are not very tall, especially from the distance. It's not very easy to find them and essential to follow the google coordinates. You do not require a 4x4 car to visit. Camping is allowed, as long as you do not leave any garbage behind.

In 2008, the ship was permanently docked in Dubai’s Mina Rashid. It was then converted into a 224-room floating hotel. The refurbished vessel is open for all who want to experience a night or two on a historic ocean liner. The floating hotel has plenty to offer. The British pub, The Golden Lion, deemed to be the oldest pub in Dubai can be found inside the ship. The Chart Room is a real time-capsule, containing the original nautical interior and furniture. At the bar is the original glass route-map, where passengers could track the progress of the ship’s Atlantic crossing. The Grand Lounge is a showroom decorated with red curtains, where you can enjoy a dinner while catching a show. With over 6,000 books, the QE2 had one of the largest libraries at sea. The extensive book collection now is displayed in the lobby area. On the heritage tour, you will get to know more about the history of the vessel, the exciting life of the crews and passengers, and the celebrities that showed up on QE2. Among some of the ship’s more famous guest were Princess Diana, Nelson Mandela, Buzz Aldrin, and even Rod Stewart. The QE2 was the longest-serving Cunard Ocean Liner, and was one of the fastest passenger ships to sail in the 21st-century. She carried 2.5 million passengers, made 806 transatlantic crossings, sailed 5.6 million miles. On her last voyage, the tickets were sold in just 36 minutes. With its rich history and unique atmosphere, the QE2 is a very special experience.  Heritage tours are available on a daily basis, not just for those who stay on the ship.

114,Capital Gate,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",No building in the world leans as far as the so-called “Leaning Tower of Abu Dhabi.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/capital-gate,"The curvaceous Capital Gate skyscraper is an unmistakable feature of the Abu Dhabi skyline. At 525 feet (160 meters) tall, it is one of the tallest buildings in the city. It’s not the height that draws the eye, but the seemingly gravity-defying incline of the 35-story building. Work began on the Capital Gate in 2007 and was completed in 2011. Unsurprisingly, the architectural firm behind the skyscraper, RMJM Architects, had to get creative to build such a tilted structure. The building uses what is known as a “pre-cambered” core. Built using 15,000 cubic meters of concrete reinforced with 10,000 tons of steel, the core was created with a slight incline in the opposite direction to the eventual lean of the building. As the building rose, the pre-cambered core was gradually pulled up and compressed into a vertical position, helping to support the skyscraper. This fight against gravity wouldn’t have gotten very far without the building’s sturdy base. The skyscraper sits on a foundation made from 490 pilings, the largest of which have a diameter of three feet and three inches (one meter). These reach a depth of 89 feet (30 meters) below the ground, providing stability against the gravitational pull created by the incline. And just how extreme is that incline? Well, the Capital Gate has a whopping 18-degree incline to the west. That’s four times as much as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which these days has an incline of about 3.97 degrees (it used to lean 5.5 degrees in 1990). Capital Gate is now recognized by Guinness as the world’s “farthest manmade leaning building,” a record previously held by the medieval Leaning Tower of Suurhusen (5.19 degrees). One other notable feature of the building’s exterior is the sculptural stainless steel “splash” that flows down the front of the skyscraper. Near ground level it flows out horizontally, forming a canopy over the hotel’s entrance while also acting as a solar shield to help keep the building cool.  Capital Gate is located along Khaleej Al Arabi Street, next to the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre in the Capital Centre district. The skyscraper is about a 15-minute drive from the airport and nine miles from the city’s popular Corniche and Qasr Al Watan. The hotel contains about 16,000 square meters of luxury office space and a five-star Hyatt hotel. There’s also a large atrium on the 17th and 18th floors with a swimming pool and cantilevered tea lounge.",skyscrapers architectural oddities architecture

Every December, camels strut their stuff as part of Abu Dhabi’s Al Dhafra Festival. Their catwalk is an unnamed stretch of dusty desert road, which people have taken to calling “Million Street” because the most beautiful beasts typically sell for millions of dollars in local currency. The camel beauty pageant, called the mazayna, is the highlight of the decade-old festival. Camel breeders primp and prep their most dashing dromedaries before parading them before a panel of expert judges. The animals are divided into different categories, based on their color. According to the judges’ camel beauty standards, a winner should have big eyes framed with lush lashes, a nose that droops downward, a long neck, and a high hump. Camel owners mark their winning entries by smearing a traditional blend of saffron paste on the animal’s head. The festival is a celebration of Bedouin culture. It’s also a way for breeders to promote and preserve purebred bloodlines. Hundreds of camel herders come from across the Gulf attend. In the weeks preceding the festival, their caravans pile into the area, where they set up camel camps along Million Street. In addition to the beauty pageant, the festival also includes other events that highlight traditional aspects of Bedouin culture like a camel milking contest, falconry exhibits, Arabian horse racing, and date packaging.",contests beauty deserts festivals roads animals

119,World's First Gold-Dispensing ATM,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Feed it cash, get your very own gold bar.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-first-gold-dispensing-atm,"Based on the notion that flowers are “more expensive[…] They wilt and you (as a man) don’t get as many points at home as if you bring gold,” the German company TG Gold-Super-Markt began providing the public a service for which it clamored: ATMs dispensing funds in cold, hard bullion in place of cash. After a single-day test run in a Frankfurt train station, the world’s first gold bar-dispensing ATM opened to much fanfare in the lobby of the Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi in 2010. Since its debut in the UAE, a small but mighty array of these counterintuitive little machines have cropped up around the world – arguably the most fitting of which can be found in the lobby of Las Vegas’ Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino. By removing the overhead costs of a brick-and-mortar store, Gold To Go’s people suggest that the service it offers its clientele is one of supreme value, bolstered by the opportunity to invest in economically stable, tangible goods available in the blink of an eye. But, when catering to a demographic for whom traditional demonstrations of wealth and thoughtful gestures simply won’t do, it’s important to diversify the product being offered, as the novelty of owning a one-size-fits-all gold bar loses its luster quickly. It follows, therefore, that in addition to offering 24-carat bars in 1, 5 and 10 gram sizes, the ATM also has a built-in “gift box” option. Inside these gift boxes, gold coins embossed with symbols such as a maple leaf, kangaroo, and more can be churned out as lavish tokens of affection that will avoid the aforementioned dreaded wilt of fresh cut flowers. The machine contains a computer that tracks the market price of gold in realtime. Failsafes are built-in to prevent money laundering, including a maximum of three purchases in a single day, and a required ID scan accompanying all purchases exceeding 1000 Euro. Balancing out such practicalities is the lone fact that the machine itself is plated in gold leaf, which makes it a delightfully literal gold ATM.

But for those with a more intrepid spirit, seeking an alternative to the pomp of the major emirate cities, the abandoned fort of Mezyad may be just the thing. While its creators are unknown, Mezyad is thought to have been built during the 19th century, but very little of its origin story survives. According to a report by Gulf News, at various points in its history it has doubled as a police station, been used as a border post, and was also occupied by a British paramilitary group, the Trucial Oman Scouts, during the 1950s. The fortress shows signs of restoration, but in recent years it has been neglected and deeply undervalued despite its hugely dramatic appeal at the base of the grand Jebel Hafeet. Its camouflaged mud walls and backdrop of cool palm trees only add to its picturesque value.

Sheikh Hamad bin Hamdan Al Nahyan decided to throw a little money around and carve his name into a beach on his private island Futaisi. Futaisi already has its own resort and golf course, but the massive carving of “Hamad,” in the sand will certainly put the island on the map. Al Nahyan, a member of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates conceived the idea and hired workers from Pakistan and Bangladesh to complete the project, which finished 1000-meter high letters stretching along two miles of beach on the Arabian Gulf. To ensure that the carving did not wash away with the tides, Al Nahyan dug the letters deep enough to form waterways, in effect absorbing the water instead of caving in on itself. Written in block lettering, the giant “Hamad,” is so large and deep that it can even be seen from space. Many people who have seen the carving have asked why the name was written in English without the swoops of Arabic. Although unclear, it seems Al Nahyan wanted as much global appeal and fame as possible.

An intricate set of labyrinthine alleys criss-crosses the city, beyond which stand centuries-old clay brick houses. Their facades have beautifully elaborate stuccoed patterns that draw from Arabic, African, and Indian traditions. Keep an eye out for intricate abstract designs, floral patterns, animals, and calligraphy. These patterns also extend to the interior of some houses. Some buildings even feature the Star of David, which attests to Yemen’s Jewish tradition and Zabid’s past as a hub for culture and religion. The traditional buildings are constructed from a mix of clay and mud brick, limestone, and wood. Some even have thatched roofs. It’s a style of architecture that appears throughout the Tihama plain, but is most common in Zabid. Unfortunately, newer buildings are threatening some of its most exquisite traditional brick architecture. A worrying number of these historic houses have been replaced by concrete buildings inside the city walls. A small population boom after the Gulf War prompted people to either renovate the old buildings or replace them with newer structures. Some of the traditional houses that managed to survive tend to remain neglected due to poverty. According to UNESCO, around 40 percent of the city’s historic structures have been compromised, prompting it to put the city on its “List of World Heritage in Danger.” Zabid is one of the oldest settlements still inhabited in Yemen. Based on historical records, it was already in existence by 631 A.D. Zabid eventually became the capital of Yemen from the 13th to the 15th century. A thick wall surrounds and defines the boundaries of the city. The construction of the Great Mosque (Asa’ir) was started in the 9th century. It’s still standing in all its ancient majesty, and is just one of the city’s 86 mosques.

At 2600m above sea level in the middle of a craggy mountain landscape of fissures and gorges, the town’s landscape is heaped in drama. The only approach to the village is via an impressive, arched stone bridge, which spans one of the mountain gorges. Its secluded position and its sole point of entry made Shaharah incredibly inaccessible. Water cisterns within the village and nearby terraced fields enabled the village to endure even lengthy sieges. For centuries, the village successfully withstood innumerable armies and conquerors. In fact, it wasn’t until the use of air force during the 1960s, in the Yemeni Civil War that the village’s isolated location was finally broken. Since the 9th century, the village also held a reputation of being an important place of Islamic learning, and scholars throughout the region in the town were well known. Unfortunately, the village is located in Northern Yemen, where the Shia Insurgency turned the region into a de facto war zone. For this reason, foreigners are currently discouraged from visiting the area. While the village itself is considered safe, the roads leading into this region are not.

The Middle-Eastern-styled palace as it stands today was actually built relatively recently, in the 1930s by an Islamic spiritual leader named Yahya Muhammad Hamiddin, but it seems that he was building atop a preexisting structure that was built in the 1700s by an Islamic scholar. The tall castle was intended to be the leader’s summer home, and featured a number of facilities including appointment rooms for his highly appointed guests and separate spaces for cooling water in earthen jars. The rooms are built up the side of a tall rock spire, culminating in a grand tower at its pinnacle. The Imam Yahya was assassinated in 1948, but his iconic palace still stands and it has become a popular example of Yemeni architecture. While it is no longer used as a royal residence, the palace has been refitted as a museum and can be toured for a fee. Visitors can range about through the kitchens, storage rooms, and appointment rooms connected by a small labyrinth of stairways leading through the five-story structure.

128,Cisterns of Tawila,"Aden, Yemen","This impressive system of tanks was used to store drinking water as long as 2,000 years ago.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cisterns-of-tawila,"Meandering around the busy streets in Crater, Aden’s city center, one could forget that it has been a major geopolitical player for millennia. Its strategic position on the Europe-India sea route ensured that a thriving settlement existed at least as far back as 1,000 BC. Given the arid climate, it is fitting that this city is home to a complex ancient system of cisterns built to provide water for its residents. Nearly two millennia ago, the cisterns of Tawila were carved out of the volcanic rocks of the Shamsan mountains to collect and store rainwater and to prevent flooding in the crucial Yemeni city of Aden. The first mention of the drinking water cisterns can be found in some ancient manuscripts from the 7th century. This gives reason to believe the tanks are at least 1,500 years old, but most historians agree they are probably even older. The most credible theory is that the people known as Himyarites, who ruled Aden beginning in 115 BC, probably built the cisterns around that time, as they were known for constructing water-catchment structures in the areas they controlled. After being used for a few centuries, the water system was eventually abandoned. By the time the British, who had occupied Aden in 1829, discovered the deserted cisterns in the mid-19th century, the tanks were almost completely buried by debris. A British diplomat named Sir Robert L. Playfair is credited with cleaning up the ancient water basins and rehabilitating them as a source of fresh water for the port city. Of the original 53 cisterns, only 18 remain, and have a combined capacity of 19 million gallons. The largest are the Coghlan tank and the Playfair Tank, which is circular. These days, the cisterns are empty, but the site is open to visitors. The political instability in the area has taken its toll on the ancient infrastructure. This is not the first time in the nearly two millennia of their existence that the cisterns witnessed war and destruction, but they have survived thus far and will probably survive this crisis too.",tanks waterworks engineering infrastructure ancient water history
129,Queen Arwa Mosque,"Jiblah, Yemen","One of Yemen’s oldest and most beautiful mosques was named for the incredible, historical queen buried inside it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/queen-arwa-mosque,"Queen Arwa Mosque is one of the oldest and most beautiful mosques in Yemen. At the start of its construction in 1056, this building was not meant to be a mosque, but a palace. It was Queen Arwa who repurposed it. Queen Arwa is an extremely interesting figure in Yemeni history. Born in 1048 in Haraz, she was the niece of Yemen’s ruler. She lost both parents at a young age and was brought up by the royal side of her family in Sana’a. Described as beautiful, well-educated, and highly intelligent, Arwa at the age of 17 married her cousin Ahmad al-Mukarram bin Ali, thus acquiring the title of Sayyada Arwa. In accordance with the Yemeni rules of inheritance, Arwa’s husband become the ruler of Yemen, but, being unable to rule due to his poor health, he delegated all his powers and authority to Arwa, who co-reigned the state with her mother-in-law until she died in 1087. Holding a position of authority, Arwa did not shy away from her duties, which meant that she often had to mix with men—which was not unheard of, but is certainly a significant fact. The year 1087 was a turning point for Arwa, as she became the only de facto ruler of Yemen. One of her first actions was to move the capital of Yemen from Sana’a to Jibla, about 155 miles (250 kilometers) to the south of Sana’a. And one of the first actions Arwa took in Jibla was to repurpose Dar al-Ezz palace, which was still under construction at that point, into a mosque. After her first husband died in 1091, Arwa married her late husband’s cousin Saba ibn Ahmad. It seems that the marriage was a politically motivated, as by doing this, Arwa managed to maintain power and authority. When her second husband died in 1101, Arwa became the sole ruler, a position she retained until her death in 1138. She was buried in Queen Arwa Mosque, which became an important pilgrimage site for pious Yemenis. Queen Arwa Mosque, which stands as an architectural testimony to her legacy, has a rectangular base with an open courtyard delimited by four corridors running under archways. It is accompanied by two beautifully ornate minarets.  No matter which direction one arrives in Jibla from, Queen Arwa Mosque is impossible to miss. The mosque is still active today.

130,Bayt Baws,"Sana'a, Yemen",A nearly abandoned Jewish settlement perched atop a hill in the heart of Yemen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bayt-baws,"This nearly abandoned settlement is a perched on top of a hill. It has steep slopes on three sides that acted as a natural defense, leaving only the south side easily accessible, and this is where the only gate to the village is located. None of this is unique, though; you’ll find many similar hilltop villages throughout Yemen. What makes the village stand out is that it is a largely deserted Jewish settlement in the heart of Yemen. The village was founded by the Bawsites during the Sabaean Kingdom. When exactly the Jewish community first arrived in Yemen is a matter of contention. One theory holds that King Solomon sent some merchants to Yemen, and some of them settled down. Another theory says Yemeni tribes converted to Judaism after the Queen of Sheba paid a visit to King Solomon. And yet another theory pinpoints the arrival of the Jews in Yemen to 1451 BC. The only certainty is that the oldest archaeological record of a Jewish community residing in Yemen goes back to 110 BC. But though they’d been living in Yemen for centuries, most of the Yemeni Jewish community relocated to Israel in 1949 and 1950, during Operation Magic Carpet, and some more in 1959, while a minority moved to the United States. More people left the settlement of Bayt Baws in the 1990s, after urbanization caused the city of Sana’a to swallow the land around it. Today, Bayt Baws consists of neglected mud houses slowly disintegrating and narrow alleys meandering through compound walls. Most gates ushering into the courtyards are open. However, caution should be taken, as parts of the abandoned may be unsafe.  The best way to reach Bayt Baws is to hire a taxi from Sana’a. No one is guarding the gate, and anyone can enter Bayt Baws any time. Children from the settlement surrounding Bayt Baws are likely to follow you through the village.",jewish villages urban planning cities
131,Minaret of Al-Muhdhar Mosque,"Tarim, Yemen",The tallest minaret in Yemen is 150 feet high and entirely made of mud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/minaret-of-almuhdhar-mosque,"Located in Yemen’s Hadhramaut Valley, the ancient town of Tarim is widely recognized as a hub of religion, culture, and science, and in particular an important center for theological and juridical studies. The centerpiece of the historic town is the Al-Muhdhar Mosque or, to be more precise, its minaret. The mosque’s prominent white minaret—the narrow, pointed tower from which Muslims are called to prayer—rises to a height of over 150 feet, making it the tallest tower throughout Tarim, and in fact the tallest minaret in all of Yemen. Tarim is also a place where different architectural styles combine to create new aesthetics, and the minaret of Al-Muhdar Mosque is no exception. The minaret has a square base and an internal staircase leads all the way to the top of the structure, which, in accordance with the tradition of the region, it is entirely made of mud. Lime plaster covers the exterior of the minaret and gives it the bright white color that so stands out against the rocky mountain in the background. The unique minaret was designed by Abu Bakr bin Shihab and Alawi Al  Mash’hūr, two native writers, and its construction was completed in 1914. The mosque is named after Omar Al’Muhdar, a prominent Tarimi leader from the 15th century.

132,Tower of Silence,"Aden, Yemen",The remains of a Zoroastrian temple that bore witness to a time when Aden was a flourishing trading hub.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tower-of-silence-aden,"The 19th century witnessed a flurry of trading activity throughout the Indian Ocean, and as a result, a sizable Parsee community became established in Aden. A Parsee businessman by the name of Cowasjee Dinshaw Adenwalla bankrolled the construction of a Temple of Fire accompanied by the Tower of Silence. Like other Zoroastrian towers of silence, this site was used as a form of burial known as excarnation. In this practice, the bodies of the deceased were left inside roofless towers, exposed to the elements and carrion birds—in this case, kites and crows. This enterprise culminated with the opening of the Adenwalla Agiary and consecration of the Holy Fire in 1883. In the 1960s, Yemen became the only country in the Middle East to set up a communist government. In view of these radical political changes, a debate began within the Parsee community whether the Holy Flame should be relocated. Once the decision was made, it took years of negotiations with the authorities to arrange for the transfer. In 1976, the Holy Flame finally boarded a plane and was taken to Lonavala, near Mumbai. Several unmarked trails lead to the hilltop, where the arches of the inner circle of the tower remain, from which there are commanding views of Crater neighborhood, the harbor and Sira Castle.",zoroastrianism temples burial places ruins

134,Winter Garden Theatre,"Toronto, Ontario",A botanically themed auditorium blooms within the world’s last operating double-decker theater.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/winter-garden-theatre,"In this theater, leafy plants cascade downward, cloaking the ceiling in a veil of flora. Nature scenes adorn the walls, making each performance feel like an enchanting garden adventure. In 1913, a flagship theater for Marcus Loew’s chain was built in downtown Toronto. Unusually, the theater had two separate stages stacked on top of each other. The Elgin Theatre on the ground floor was traditionally decorated in red and gold with classical references, but the architect had a more novel idea for the Winter Garden seven stories above. Designed to bring the outside in, the walls were painted with murals of plants, trellises, and even the odd lamppost while the ceiling was covered with real dried leaves. As part of this whimsical fantasy-like decor, lights became lanterns and columns became tree trunks. The stage area itself represented the sky, complete with painted clouds and an illuminated Moon. Originally built to stage variety performances known as vaudeville, by the 1920s the rise of the film industry had reduced the popularity of the genre. Reacting to lower audience numbers, the Elgin Theatre was converted into a cinema. In 1928, however, after just 15 years in operation, the doors to the Winter Garden were simply locked. They would remain shut for the next 53 years. Continuing to cater to the movie market, the Elgin Theatre was fitted with a curved “Cinerama” screen in the 1960s which required removing the opera boxes. Curiously, the screen was never actually used and the damage was just covered with a curtain after the owners changed their minds. The fate of the building continued to decline and by the 1970s, this once-grand theater complex was best known for showing softcore porn movies. The last ever film shown there was What the Swedish Butler Saw in the early 1980s. Threatened with demolition, the Ontario Heritage Trust stepped in and purchased the venues in 1981. With a budget of $29 million, conservation specialists, and an army of volunteers, the two theaters were painstakingly restored, including cleaning of the original paint work with raw bread dough and weaving of over 5,000 beech branches back into the garden ceiling. Now a working theater once again, the Elgin and Winter Garden is the world’s only example of a double-decker Edwardian theater still in operation.  A 90-minute paid guided tour is available on Mondays year-round, and the building is usually open for free during the Doors Open festival in May.

During the 1950s, they cleared trails and constructed rock walls over 8 acres with nothing but hand tools. Ernest built them a little home that looked a bit like a gingerbread house, and installed a gravity water system using the waterfall across the highway, which is still in use today. When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven, and in 1960 they decided to officially open up their Enchanted Forest to the public. What was once just a project they enjoyed together to invent their own happy place for their retirement was now a highly popular tourist spot for sightseers. One could not drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house belonging to the couple that created it all. By 1970, a million people had stopped to visit the castle and marvel at the statues and tree houses and all the other surprises nestled in the Needhams’ forest. The couple realized that it had become unmanageable, and their retirement idea had turned into a challenging full time job. Wanting to enjoy the fruits of their labor before it was too late, Doris and Ernest sold their forest to Rocky and Juliet Ehlers and their children, Aza, Silas and Naomi. Fortunately, the Ehlers loved the Enchanted Forest for what it was, and have continued to care for it and keep it available to visitors. The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage with ferns growing on the roof, or a favorite nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest treehouse in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.  The Enchanted Forest is located midway between Sicamous and Revelstoke, British Columbia: 32 km (20 mi) West on Highway 1 from Revelstoke, and 35 km (21 mi) East on Highway 1 from Sicamous.

136,Casa Loma,"Toronto, Ontario",A 98-room castle in the middle of Toronto that bankrupted a 19th century electricity multimillionaire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-loma,"Sir Henry Mill Pellatt, a Canadian soldier and financier, gained immense wealth from founding the Toronto Electric Light Company in 1883, which brought electricity to the streetlights of Canada’s largest city. Business boomed – soon he was the chairman of 21 companies, owned railroads, generated electricity from Niagara Falls, and was knighted for his military service. His monopoly grew for a full 28 years until 1911, when everything started going downhill. Pellatt, who had been intrigued by castles since visiting Europe in his teenage years, decided to use his fortune of $17 million (modern-day $412 million) to build a personal château in the middle of Toronto. This 98-room castle, named Casa Loma, cost nearly 2 million man-hours and $3.5 million to build, including a whopping $50,000 a year for 40 live-in staff and $250,000 just to put the names of his horses in 18-carat gold — and that’s all in 1911 dollars. In retrospect, it’s no surprise that Pellatt went bankrupt pretty quickly. By 1920, the Canadian electricity market was made publicly owned (destroying his main source of income), and the economy was in a slump from the end of World War I. Pellatt owed over a million dollars to the Home Bank of Canada and was in so much debt that he sold everything he could, for an average of 17% of its original cost. Garden vases for $16, two brass sundials for $25, and a $75,000 pipe organ for $40 (despite the auctioneer giving it a rendition of “Auld Lang Syne”). To sum it up, in the words of Canadian politician Charles Henderson, “a Persian rug for the price of a doormat.” Sadly for Pellatt, he eventually had to sell his palace and move out. Nowadays, Casa Loma is owned by the city and has become a museum and tourist attraction for visitors to Toronto. Although Pellatt sold its bear skin rugs, bronze buffalo head, and the grand marble fountain featuring statues of children holding up a dolphin, Casa Loma still holds many of its original attributes. This includes the 10,000-book library, the plant-filled conservatory complete with a marble floor and a stained glass ceiling, the 60-foot-tall Great Hall with wooden chandeliers and sculpted figures on its pillars, the beautiful gardens abounding with flowers, and the mahogany stables built with a Spanish tile floor suited for the hooves of the horses. The castle had three indoor bowling alleys, a rifle range, a built-in vacuum system, a plethora of bronze doors, two secret, multi-floor passageways, a never-completed swimming pool now filled with gravestones, and 30 bathrooms (one of the showers contained six different showerheads for a full-body spray). Casa Loma serves as both an ostentatious landmark and a reminder to manage our money wisely. Many movies have been filmed here including some of the X-Men movies.",money eccentric homes castles gardens homes plants statues
137,Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library,"Toronto, Ontario",One of Canada's most incredible rare book collections holds hundreds of thousands of gorgeous tomes that the general public can touch.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thomas-fisher-rare-books-library,"Arguably one of the most fascinating libraries in Canada, the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library houses the Rare and Special collections of the University of Toronto. The library strives to preserve these collections while making them entirely accessible to the public – any visitor may request to personally view and handle the library’s holdings. While it is nearly impossible to encapsulate the wealth of material stored in the library, which holds around 700,000 volumes and 3,000 meters of manuscripts, a few collections stand out. One of the more intriguing groups of books is a fantastic collection of “monster” volumes spanning from reprints of ancient works to 18th-century catalogs. These include Cicero’s Book of Natural History (you can view an edition from 1551) , Ulysses Androvandi’s Monstroum Historiae (1642) and Palfijn’s version of Licetus’ Book of Monsters (1708). For those more interested in medical obscura, the library also holds a large collection of anatomical works, including that of the famous anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564). Many of these anatomical volumes have been made accessible as part of the library’s digital collection - the online Anatomia collection alone features 4,500 digitized images representing works dating from 1522 to 1867. Other collections include a treasure trove of beautiful Alice in Wonderland editions, numerous historical printings of Shakespeare’s works, and a small cache of ancient papyrus writings. For those who wish to visit the library, but are less sure of what materials they would like to view, the library also curates monthly exhibits to showcase parts of the collection. You can also follow the library on Facebook and Youtube for a glimpse at new acquisitions and upcoming exhibitions, as well as an extensive Flickr page filled with images of their current holdings.   Visitors interested in viewing books, manuscripts, and other materials--outside of those currently on display by the library--must submit formal requests on the website. Visitors must provide photo identification and fill out paperwork to obtain a reader card, which is necessary in order to have their material requests reviewed and granted by the library.

The legendary labyrinth beneath the Palace of Knossos on the island of Crete, in which the hero Theseus killed the Minotaur, is perhaps the best known of the early mazes. Other mazes were made by the people of northern Europe, perhaps to confuse evil spirits or symbolically thread the difficult path of life. The hedge maze reached its zenith as a form in Renaissance England, more as a device for entertainment than serious purpose. The most famous was built by Cardinal Wolsley at Hampton Court. Today VanDusen Garden in Vancouver, Canada carries on the tradition with one of only six Elizabethan hedge mazes in North America. The maze is made of 3,000 pyramidal cedars – Thuja occidentalis ‘Fastigiata’ to be specific – all planted in the autumn of 1981 and slowly grown into the form of the maze one finds today. Named for local lumber magnate and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen, the gardens are run jointly by the Vancouver Park Board and a non-profit volunteer association. They are open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. In addition to the maze, the gardens cover 55 acres and display plants from around the world.

Fuller, who popularized, perfected, and named the Geodesic Dome, designed a 20-story-tall dome in the fashion of his hallmark design to represent the USA. Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.  The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel. When the fair ended, the pavilion remained. The dome was originally meant to be bolted together, allowing the pavilion to be dismantled when the fair was finished, but budget constraints led workers to weld the dome together instead, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape. The sphere would remain open to the public for nine years until an accident involving some routine welding maintenance caused the acrylic covering to catch fire, engulfing the entire sphere in a spectacular ball of fire with flames that burned for 30 minutes. When the flames subsided, there was no sign of the acrylic walls to be seen, but the steel trusses of the dome remained. After the fire, the dome was closed to the public for over fifteen years. In June 1995, the dome rose from the ashes and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. The reopened dome sported no acrylics on its exterior this time around, due to the costs of keeping the gigantic dome warm and cool, and probably to prevent future accidents. However, the dome was hit with another disaster in 1998 when an ice storm forced the biosphere to close for five months. The biosphere reopened, and still houses the museum. Through the fire and Canadian ice storms, the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of “Bucky’s” geodesic architecture.

141,Allan Gardens Conservatory,"Toronto, Ontario","The Victorian-era greenhouse is stuffed with tropical plants, and open 365 days a year.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/allan-gardens,"Even on Toronto’s most bitterly blustery days, it’s balmy inside the Allan Gardens Conservatory. Its greenhouses are home to orchids, bromeliads, cacti, succulents, and—beneath a soaring glass dome—banana trees and palms. The horticultural center first sprouted in 1858, with a five-acre plot of land donated to the Toronto Horticultural Society by the politician George William Allan. By 1879, the site housed a wood, iron, and glass conservancy, which hosted galas, concerts, and flower shows. Then, a fire licked through in 1902. For several minutes, “the cracking of the flames was relieved by the curious tinkling sounds of thousands of falling panes” fracturing from the ceiling, the Ottawa Journal reported at the time. Most of the structure’s “carefully treasured trees and shrubs from the tropics,” were “more or less damaged by the heat, and the necessarily rough usage in removing them,” the paper continued. Many of the plants were scorched to a crisp, and the structure itself was reduced to “a heap of ruins.” A new crop took root when the Palm House dome opened in 1910. Over the years, branching greenhouses have been tacked on to its sides, so the whole structure now spans 16,000 square feet. The garden has been the site of political activism, too. The National Council of Women of Canada, which agitated for suffrage, immigration, and other policies, was founded on the site in 1893. The grounds have also been the site of protests against poverty and nuclear weapons, and a violent skirmish erupted in 1965, when a handful of suspected Nazi sympathizers were beaten in front of a crowd of thousands. It was also the site of a rally to protest the G20 summit. For several years, it’s been the terminus of Dyke March celebrations. Visitors who arrive in December or early January might encounter the Conservatory’s holiday flower show. For the past 40 years, this annual festival has nodded to the Victorian era. The gardens’ regular cast of greenery is joined by a rotating roster of special players, such as topiary sleighs, reindeer, and parlor scenes, featuring a hearth, a penguin playing a mossy piano, and a flouncy dress made with boughs of fir. When the holiday show closes up, these give way to other seasonal shows, including one to herald spring with hundreds of hydrangeas and Easter lilies.",topiary tropical flowers victorian flora conservation gardens plants
142,Habitat 67,"Montreal, Québec",This 1967 experiment in modular architecture was designed to be a new model for urban living.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/habitat-67,"When you go to Montreal, there’s a strange building on the waterfront that’ll catch your eye. Or maybe that’s what drew you to the city in the first place. Habitat 67 was designed by Moshe Safdie as his graduate thesis while an architecture student at McGill University, and was later built to temporarily house workers, who came from all over the world, to work on Expo 67, the 1967 World’s Fair. The design is an experiment in modular architecture meant to imitate an organic growth, bringing together nature and geometric patterns. It’s in the metabolism style that was popular in Japan in the 1960s, commonly associated with the Nakagin Capsule Tower. While often called a Brutalist masterpiece, Safdie insists instead that it is actually a reaction against the Brutalist movement at that time. Safdie designed the Habitat for people in the middle class, as a way to improve quality of life in an urban environment. Each unit had access to a private garden, most of which were literally built on top of the roof of a neighboring apartment. Each of the 354 identical pre-fabricated boxes were constructed at a factory built next door that was opened specifically to build the models. The boxes created 158 apartments between 1 and 4 bedrooms (since reduced to 148 due to some being combined into larger units). Living in the Habitat has never been cheap. With a final cost of $22 million, it ended up running massively over budget, resulting in the government-owned building asking for unusually high rental rates in order to recoup the costs of construction. Consider this: In 1968 average rents in Montreal were a few hundred dollars for an entire house, but the Habitat was asking for closer to $1,000 per one bedroom unit. Today, the Habitat is one of the premier addresses in Montreal. Habitat was (and still is) far from the city center, located in an industrial area near no conveniences like the Metro, shopping centres, or even other homes. This is ironic considering that Safdie’s original plan called for a much larger community with 1,000+ apartments, shops, and even a school. Many critics of the Habitat believe that the intended purpose of the community was to provide affordable homes for the lower classes and point to the extraordinarily expensive apartments as proof of its failure. In fact, Safdie has stated from the start that Habitat was built for the middle class as a way to provide suburban-type housing within an urban environment — a new model for city living. Habitat 67 is still home to hundreds of Montreal residents.  The area isn't served by public transit, so the best option is to drive or prepare for a long walk. One of the easiest ways of getting there is to take the metro over to Parc Jean-Drapeau (be sure to catch Buckminster Fuller's biosphere) and walk over the Pont de la Concorde. Sadly, the apartments are highly exclusive and the property is well guarded, but you can buy tickets and get the guided tour, which includes access to the architect's apartment. Guided tours are from May to October and are usually sold out in advance so book early. Another option is to rent a bicycle from the bike-sharing program in Montreal to cycle to Habitat 67.

143,Sewers of Toronto,"Toronto, Ontario",A well-preserved network of cavernous tunnels have spent silent centuries removing Toronto's waste.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sewers-of-toronto,"It takes a truly special set of circumstances to turn sewage into a landmark. Or, more appropriately, to turn the path it takes to sewage heaven into a landmark. Large cities have elaborate sewer networks by necessity. Well-planned cities have expertly designed and maintained sewers. And very old cities have large, cavernous sewers that are the stuff legends are made of. No single one of these qualities makes a sewer worth visiting, or even possible to visit. But together, they create a secret underworld begging to be explored. Toronto is one of the few cities that check all of the boxes above and more, making their subterranean waste management network something magical to behold. Old, well-maintained, and elaborate, the sewage tunnels in Toronto are just the way fiction has always imagined a sewer should be: wide and high-ceilinged, perfectly sized for escaping bank robbers, or a group of teenage mutant ninja turtles. Toronto’s sewer tunnels are so large and well-built, they look more like soggy subway tunnels than rivers of wastewater. The resulting intrigue has created a subculture of urban exploration around subterranean Toronto. Daring adventurers and mischievous youths have long ventured into the city’s underground passageways to map their trajectory and examine their current state. Each leg of the sewer system has its own story. The Garrison Creek Sewer running underneath the west end of the city, smoothly beveled and circular like a pneumatic tube, was once literally a creek. In the late 1800s, once the creek became highly trafficked with human waste, the city wisely thought it best to just go ahead and bury the creek. Looking at it now, however, it’s shocking to think of it as once being a natural above ground waterflow, and just as shocking to think that is over 100 years old. Entrances to the tunnels are exactly where you’d expect them to be—manholes, maintenance shafts, spillways and water treatment offshoots—though, unsurprisingly, entry isn’t allowed. Visits are granted only with permission and guidance by a public works employee. They literally do not make them like these anymore, and the tunnels are an unsung marvel of public engineering. Toronto is a city that takes its sewage seriously, as evidenced by the ornate water treatment plant nicknamed “The Palace of Purification,” which is where all the contents of these intriguing tunnels end up.  Sewers can carry human sewage and/or stormwater. Exploring is off-limits and can be dangerous due to flash floods and toxic sewer gases.

144,Capilano Suspension Bridge,"North Vancouver, British Columbia",This expansive bridge in the Canadian wilderness was originally just built for friends.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/capilano-suspension-bridge-2,"After sending a team of horses swimming across the Capilano River with a long rope in tow, the builder of the original Capilano Suspension Bridge could never have dreamed that his simple span would become a world-class attraction. Built in 1889 by Scottish civil engineer George Grant Mackay, the 460-foot bridge was constructed of hemp rope and cedar planks. Once the bridge was in place, Mackay’s property became popular among his friends who took the name “the Capilano Tramps” to mark themselves as the adventurous types who would dare cross the swaying bridge. The crude original version was upgraded to a wire cable bridge in 1903. Then in 1910, the property was sold and began changing hands across the years as each subsequent owner built the bridge’s reputation as a world-class adventure tourism destination. The span was completely rebuilt in 1956 and is now under the purview of a small chain of rustic tourist attractions. The Capilano Suspension Bridge continues to draw huge crowds of visitors every year and is ranked as one of Vancouver’s most popular destinations. Additions have been made to the park to increase the visitor experience. On the west side of the bridge is the Treetop Adventures Canopy Walk, which consists of eight wooden bridges suspended between a number of huge Douglas Fir trees over 100 feet in the air. Bridges are secured to the trees not through nails or bolts that would damage the trees, but through specially engineered steel collars.  Once removed, these collars will have done no damage to the host trees at all. In 2011, the vertigo-inducing Cliffwalk opened on the east side of the canyon.  Pinned straight into the rock cliffs, the Cliffwalk is a series of secure and narrow walkways jutting out from the cliffs, through the trees, and over the river. Providing excellent views of the Suspension Bridge itself and the river below, as well as the trees growing out of the cliffs, and the surrounding forest, the Cliffwalk is a unique way to appreciate, and feel the thrill, of the West Coast. Not bad for something that started as a simple bridge built to entertain friends.  During the festive period (November to January), Capilano Suspension Bridge sees an increase in footfall, visitors are drawn in by the hundreds of lights which are draped over the bridge and the surrounded treetops. Arrive early and wrap up warm. None of the attractions at Capilano Suspension Bridge Park are wheelchair accessible and strollers are not permitted. Any visitor on crutches or in a wheelchair receives complimentary entry admission. Plan at least 2 hours to fully experience the park, more if you stay for lunch.The park offers a free shuttle from various locations in downtown Vancouver throughout the day, or Vancouver Public transit also services the area.",bridges roadside attractions
145,Othello Tunnels,"Hope, British Columbia","Railways may have forged this quintet of lovely tunnels, but now they are open to hikers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/othello-tunnels,"Driving through solid rock, these lovely Canadian tunnels are the remnants of a former train system, but can now be trekked through on foot. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) constructed the Kettle Valley Railroad (KVR) to link up the Kootenay region of British Columbia with the Southern coast. In 1914, the CPR saw fit to construct a series of five tunnels through the Coquihalla River Canyon as part of the KVR. Andrew McCulloch was appointed Chief Engineer from 1910-1916 to complete the KVR, which proved to be the most challenging project of his career. With sheer vertical walls and harsh winters, the conditions for the workers weren’t ideal. Cliff ladders, suspension bridges, and simple ropes were all used to give them access to the sections they worked on. Once the tunnel system was decommissioned, the path through the Othello Tunnels became a popular trail, and they are now officially part of the Trans-Canada trail system. Technically the area is called the Coquihalla Canyon Provincial Park, but most just call it The Othello Tunnels.  A fan of Shakespeare, McCulloch named the stations after characters from The Bard’s works, and the tunnels earned their popular name from this inspiration. The tunnels are regularly closed each winter due to unsafe conditions, and occasionally even in the summers if there are too many rock slides, but if you really need to see the tunnels, they can be seen in the movies, Rambo: First Blood and Cabin In The Woods.",tunnels trains subterranean sites
146,Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden,"Vancouver, British Columbia",Traditional 15th century Chinese garden in the middle of Vancouver.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dr-sun-yat-sen-classical-chinese-garden,"Hidden behind a low white building in the middle of Vancouver’s Chinatown is the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden. The Garden, which is named for the father of modern China, is a collaboration between Canada and the People’s Republic of China. It was designed by fifty-two craftsmen from Suzhou and their Canadian counterparts, with funding provided by private, public, and government organizations from both countries. The structure is based on the garden homes of Ming Dynasty scholars and officials and is the first such garden constructed outside of China. Chinese gardens are like horticultural mosaics, packed with colors and strange surprises: winding paths, lily pads glimpsed through the leaves of a willow tree, moongates, a sudden flash of gold in the water as a fish swims by. It is deliberately designed this way, designed so that every view of the garden is a different one; the entire thing can never be seen at once. The ultimate goal of the Garden is to create a space based on Chinese philosophy, incorporating the ideas of Feng Shui, Taosim, and yin and yang to achieve perfect balance. The Garden is also “based on the harmony of four main elements: rock, water, plants, and architecture,” and juxtaposes vital herbs and plants, waterways, and mountains with buildings that blend into the organic elements. Regular events in the garden include concerts, yoga lessons, and tai chi lessons. It also has a variety of unusual and seasonal events. In June, it hosts the Vancouver Storytelling Festival. In October, the Vancouver Chinese Instrumental Society presents a Fiddles Around the World Concert. In the winter, the Garden holds the Secret Lantern Society’s Winter Solstice Lantern Festival. Other landmarks include seasonal plants: plum trees in the spring, jasmine in the winter and lotuses in the summer. The weathered limestone rocks were imported from Lake Tai near Suzhou and look different in different lights. The jade green pond is full of golden koi fish. The Penjing garden houses small trees that are 100 years old; they are known as “silent poems.” There are also many places to stop and rest; the Garden’s pavilions range from the small Han Bi Xie, or Jade Water Pavilion, which floats on the pond, to the Hua Feng Tang, or China Maple Hall, which plays host to many of the center’s meetings and events. One of the highlights of the garden is Julian Law, a 92-year-old Chinese guide with a Scottish name, who points out the highlights of the garden while also expounding at length on ancient philosophy, the global economy, etiquette rules, and Chinese history. “Listen for Beethoven in the waterfalls,” he suggests earnestly, “and please feel free to converse with the rocks.” His tour ends in the Hall of One Hundred Rivers (Bai Chuan Tang), where visitors can sip oolong tea, play mahjong and practice Chinese calligraphy.

147,Riverview Hospital,"Coquitlam, British Columbia",Historic psychiatric asylum and most-filmed location in the Great White North.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/riverview-hospital,"The stigma of mental illness is such that there seems to be an unavoidable sense of tragedy and trepidation evoked by psychiatric hospitals. One can’t help but wonder, what untold stories could be uncovered from the relics of an institution that has witnessed the torment of so many personal demons? Dating back to the early 1900s, Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam, British Columbia, has treated psychiatric survivors until as recently as the summer of 2010. West Lawn Pavilion, the first of the Riverviews’ character buildings, opened in 1913 and was home to B.C.’s most psychotically disturbed male patients. Since its closure in 1983, West Lawn is the most frequently visited and photographed abandonment on the property. From the hauntingly desolate images posted online by urban explorers and ghost hunters, it’s hard to imagine that Riverview Hospital is also home to a thriving arboretum of over 1,900 trees and a diverse wildlife population that includes black bears, bobcats, coyotes, black-tailed deer, and over 80 bird species. From its inception in 1904, Riverview was intended to serve as both a mental health facility accommodating overflow from Victoria’s Royal Jubilee Hospital and as a botanical garden for the province of British Columbia. The government purchased 1,000 acres of Coquitlam farmland to accomplish this ambitious goal, though the botanical garden was eventually relocated to the University of British Columbia. Now fully decommissioned and abandoned - with the hospital’s remaining 201 patients transferred as of July 2010 - the buildings at Riverview face an unknown fate. Over the years, the 1,000 sprawling acres initially allotted for the hospital have been reduced to 244 acres as large sections have been transformed into the Riverview Heights housing development, Colony Farm Regional Park, and Riverview Forest Park. Concerned about potential demolition for market development, advocates for Riverview are pushing for continued psychiatric care for the province’s mentally ill as well as public commitments to preserve the site’s historic 20th-century architecture and lush ecosystem. In the meantime, with its eerie decrepit interiors and serene landscape, Riverview remains Canada’s most highly scouted film location. In recent years, the hospital’s West Lawn, East Lawn (formerly the Female Chronic Unit), and Crease Clinic buildings have been the backdrop for such productions as Saw, Watchmen, Smallville, Fringe, Dark Angel, The X Files, Supernatural, Romeo Must Die, and Along Came A Spider. In April 2009, Riverview was officially recognized on the Canadian Register of Historic Places. The Riverview premises are currently under the surveillance of security personnel from the Paladin Security Group. Given the recent closures, it is uncertain whether tours will still be available via the Riverview Hospital Museum and the Riverview Horticultural Centre Society.",insane asylums abandoned hospitals abandoned insane asylums film locations memento mori abandoned ruins architectural oddities architecture

In 1824, the Montreal flock had outgrown its church, and it was time for something bigger and better. Commissioned to design a new place for the congregation to call home, Irish-American James O’Donnell, a New York Protestant, had a grand vision. Obsessed with the intricate, dramatic trappings of the Gothic Revival architecture movement, O’Donnell took the style and ran with it. Seas of color, intricate carvings, and ornate stained glass covers palatial floors and soaring ceilings in the spectacular church that remained the largest in North America for over 50 years. The church was so decadent a smaller, more modest chapel was built behind it for more practical use. Another noteworthy attraction of this breathtaking basilica is its famous Casavant Frères pipe organ - 92 electropneumatic action stops, 4 keyboards, and a sound-bending 7,000 individual pipes. This massive instrument of heavenly chorus put Casavant Frères on the map as master organ builders back in 1891. James O’Donnell, his architectural peak reached with the fabulous Notre Dame, wished to be buried inside the walls of his magnum opus, but there was one hitch - he wasn’t a Catholic. On his deathbed, O’Donnell converted, and now remains the only corpse residing in the magnificent crypt of his own design.  Métro Take the Orange line to Place d’Armes Station. Exit on Saint-Urbain Street and walk uphill toward Place D’Armes Square. Bus Take southbound Saint-Laurent bus No. 55. Get off at the Notre-Dame Street stop east of the Basilica.

150,The Bruce Peninsula Grotto,"Tobermory, Ontario",This natural sea cave hides a small wonderland of natural turquoise beauty.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-bruce-peninsula-grotto-tobermory-ontario,"Hidden in the cliff face of an escarpment on Ontario’s Bruce Peninsula, the lovely Georgian Bay’s cave known simply as “The Grotto,” has long attracted visitors with its startlingly blue waters and secluded beauty. Carved from the natural stone over thousands of years of erosion, the Grotto has become one of the most popular destinations in Bruce Peninsula National Park. It accessible both from the cave mouth at Lake level and via a rocky chimney which can be found just off the main trail. The interior of the grotto itself is an open cave filled with amazingly blue turquoise waters. The waters are made even more stunning and vibrant thanks to the light that emanates from an underwater tunnel in the grotto. While the water is certainly beautiful, it is also known for being incredibly cold, although does not deter swimmers from diving in anyway. The cave is a favorite stop for people out on a hike, checking out the boulder beaches on the coast, or just looking for a nice, secret place to take in the scenery. The Grotto is a popular attraction and very busy during the summer and on long weekends. Parking space is limited and quickly fills up. A new reservation system for the 4 hour Grotto parking time slots allows you to plan your trip in advance. Plan ahead to avoid disappointment. The Bruce Peninsula park is home to a number of bears (in fact it’s logo is a bear’s pawprint), so watch your step on the way to the grotto, since no water is so clear that it’s worth wrestling a bear for.  Access from the Cyprus Lake campground. Approximately a 45 minute hike. Maps available at the entrance and also a large map at the entrance of the trail. You can access the grotto by sliding down a hole. (not the best for claustrophobic people) and also by climbing down an escarpment of rock. For the extremely adventurous you can swim in the ice cold water around to the grotto. Several scuba diving groups also go down into the grotto.",grottoes caves ecosystems water
151,L'Anse Aux Meadows,"Saint Lunaire-Griquet, Newfoundland and Labrador",An ancient Viking village in North America that predates Columbus by 500 years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lanse-aux-meadows,"Situated at the northernmost tip of Newfoundland in Canada is a village settled by the Vikings and estimated to have been established around AD 1000, 500 years before Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas. Representing the farthest known exploration on the part of the Vikings, L’Anse aux Meadows is a made up of eight simple buildings made of sod over wooden frames. This settlement is thought to be the fabled Vinland, a place immortalized in Viking sagas as a distant outpost. L’anse aux Meadows would have been used as a stopping-over point to restock food and provisions before exploring further west, probably New Brunswick, or traveling east back to Greenland. Some believe that the Vikings may have made it as far into North America as the Great Lakes, though evidence of this is scant. The Viking buildings are widely thought to be either homes or workshops, and many are related to iron working, carpentry and boat repair. Archaeological evidence indicates that it was in use for about 15 years before it was abandoned. Whether they left due to weather, food, boredom, or were chased off by the Indigenous peoples is unknown, but it seems like they didn’t leave in haste, and took most valuables with them. The sagas about Vinland suggest that North American exploration was halted after relations soured with the Dorset or pre-Beothuk inhabitants. In order to protect the site, the Canadian government buried the excavation in white sand and covered it with sod. They built replicas of the buildings nearby, with a boardwalk surrounding. The climate at the site is sub-Arctic, and icebergs can be seen off the coast in June and July, as can whales. The building frames are laid out with signage to indicate what each space was used for. The replica spaces have costumed interpreters, highly skilled in a number of crafts and knowledgeable about the lifestyle the original occupants likely led. An interpretive center houses artifacts, a short film with recreations, and some learning stations featuring interpreters’ work to recreate crafts such as iron smelting.  The National Historic Site is open seasonally, as is the nearby independent historical-interpretation site of Norstead. Depending on when you go, there may be live blacksmithing, weaving, or cooking demonstrations, with food you can try.",long now locations ruins

When it opened in 1930, it had the distinction of being the tallest building in the British Empire. It was designed by the firm of McCarter and Nairne to evoke in their words, “some great crag rising from the sea, clinging with sea flora and fauna, tinted in sea-green, touched with gold.” The level of detail in the building is a wonder to behold. The terra cotta exterior is inlaid with reliefs of state of the art forms of transportation from the 1920s: zeppelins, steamships biplanes, and trains. The giant brass doors pick up the marine theme with intricately carved seaweed, turtles, crabs, and seahorses. The doors open onto a dazzling lobby, where the wall sconces take the form of plaster ships riding the crests of waves carved into the lobby walls. In the building’s heyday, the five elevators were operated by beautiful women in sailor suits who would escort passengers in what were the fastest elevators in the city. The lobby also contains antique telephone booths with functioning telephones. Where once the iconic building dominated downtown Vancouver, today it is dwarfed and somewhat lost amidst the newer skyscrapers. But visitors to the Marine Building will be as awestruck by its beauty as they would have been when it opened its opulent doors over eighty years ago. The beauty of the Marine Building has not been lost on Hollywood either with the ornate edifice having been featured in a number of movies and television projects. Most notably, the building has stood in for some of the most famous locations from superhero comic books such as the Baxter Building in two Fantastic Four films and Clark Kent’s workplace, The Daily Planet, in TV’s Smallville.  The main revolving doors will be locked around 5 p.m. There is a wifi hot-spot inside the lobby.

It used to be more industrial, the streets lined with single-family homes that once housed the local labor force. Most of them have small, well-tended gardens in front, but there is one particular garden that’s tended a little differently than the others. Instead of boxwood, hydrangeas and day lilies, the gardener responsible for 37 Bertmount Avenue prefers to plant Superheros, Hello Kitties, mermaids, and troll dolls. It’s known as the Doll House, and owner Shirley Sumaiser has been collecting her stuffed and plastic critters for over twenty years, using them to fill up her little plot of Leslieville. The Doll House is not just dolls—there are toys, stuffed animals, plaques, and signs, some hung from the fence, some mounted on wooden stakes, and some lining the porch and eaves. Together they create a landscape cacophony, the collection often is redone to suit a holiday or a set of new or seasonal additions. The result is an ever-changing garden of tchotchkes that attracts Toronto tourists and shutterbugs alike.

An investment banker by trade, later in life Cabot turned his full attention to gardening and garden preservation, serving for a time as chairman of the New York Botanical Gardens and as an advisor to the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and the Royal Botanical Gardens in Ontario. But private gardens were his true passion, and he established the non-profit Garden Conservancy to help protect and care for gardens that might otherwise lose in a fight against land developers. Les Jardins de Quatre-Vents, or the Garden of the Four Winds, took shape toward the end of Cabot’s life. He settled into his family estate in Quebec by creating his second major personal garden, this one on the St. Lawrence about 90 miles north of Quebec City. Spread out over 20 lush acres of rolling lawns and intricate boxwood hedges, calling it “a garden” doesn’t begin to describe it.

With whirling rides, organ music, and brightly glowing lights, it attracted thousands to the shores of the little island to revel in wholesome fun. For almost 100 years it was only accessible by classic steam-powered riverboats: The SS Ste. Clair and SS Columbia brought passengers from Detroit, each boat could bring up to 2,500 visitors at a time. Smaller ferries brought visitors from nearby Amhertsberg, Ontario and Gibraltar, Michigan. The dance hall, financed by Henry Ford, was once the second largest in the world and capable of holding 5,000 dancers. It also featured one of the world’s largest orchestrions, an automated self-playing orchestra machine, which features 419 pipes and its very own percussion section. There were also big band nights, which drew “black and tans,” multiracial crowds of young people during the 1920s. Attractions included rides such as the Nightmare, the Wild Mouse, and the Screamer as well as a Ferris wheel, a zoo, and the popular “Scootaboats.” Needless to say, the amusement park brought joy to all those who visited. Detroiters even referred to Boblo Island as “the Coney Island of Michigan.” But the old-fashioned charm of Boblo Island was eclipsed by more modern attractions like Cedar Point in its later decades, leading it to close its gates for good in 1993. Since the amusement park’s closure, Boblo Island has been renovated for luxury homes. Though many of the amusement park structures have been torn down, you might still hear a passing shriek and the tinkle of organ music amidst the remaining century-old ruins of Boblo Island. As it is an abandoned park, it is not recommended that any trespassing laws be broken trying to get in. If one is a boater or has access to a kayak, floating by the island may be the best way to see Boblo.

159,City of Waterfalls,"Hamilton, Ontario","With well over 130 falls and cascades to brag about, Hamilton, Ontario has earned its stripes as the waterfall capital of the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-of-waterfalls,"If you’ve never heard of the Niagara Escarpment (and let’s be honest, unless you were a geology major or waterfall groupie, “escarpment” might be your word of the day), you’ll be surprised to learn it’s much more than just the famous waterfall to which it owes its name. An escarpment is basically a geological ridge separating differing elevations. The Niagara escarpment — named for Niagara Falls located toward its eastern end — takes a 625-mile trip from Rochester, New York, horse-shoeing around Hamilton, Ontario, up through the Bruce Peninsula, across Manitoulin Island, Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, eastern Wisconsin, and finally dipping down along the western side of Lake Michigan in northern Illinois. Along the way it meanders through Hamilton, Ontario, leaving behind over 130 waterfalls and cascades within the city limits. Hamilton prides itself on being the City of Waterfalls, celebrating its moniker with festivals, books, artwork, a waterfall fan group, Facebook pages, and waterfall-themed hikes, walks and adventures. The Niagara Escarpment cutting through the middle of the city provides the best possible setting for falls of all shapes and sizes, from the crashing waters of Webster’s Falls, to the 120-foot pour into the Devils Punchbowl, to the steady tiered cascade of Princess Falls. None of the drops in Hamilton are as dramatic as their flashy cousin to the east, but the diversity and sheer number within a single city of 430 square miles is awfully impressive. Take that, Niagara Falls.  Waterfalls are found all along the Niagara Escarpment in Hamilton, including the communities of Dundas, Ancaster, and Stoney Creek. There are several maps and checklists to plan your waterfall circuit. Check out the website up top, or go to the City of Waterfalls Facebook page below under Sources.",waterfalls rivers water

The owners of the Shameful Tiki Room do their very best to recreate the tropical escapism of the 1960s tiki fad, and they succeed. Their emphasis is on over-the-top South Seas decor, quiet exotica lounge music to set the mood, and of course, authentically sugary tiki cocktails like the Zombie, the Hurricane, and the Mai Tai. The walls are adorned floor to ceiling - a hallmark of any good tiki joint - with Polynesian decor of varying authenticity. There are pufferfish lamps, Tapa cloths imported from Tonga and Fiji, and tiki carvings both old and new. The Shameful Tiki Room also features live music that is always appropriately tropical - mostly surf rock and gentle ukulele music. A second location has opened in Toronto, so Eastern Canadians don’t have to miss out on the fun.",tiki kitsch bars Unique Restaurants & Bars shops

These are just some of the things that come to mind when thinking about Montreal’s Jean-Talon Market. This open-air market, which has served the city since 1933, is located in the geographical center of the island of Montreal in the “Little Italy” district. It has 150-plus vendors and covers over almost 220,000 square feet. In the summer the vendor numbers double, most coming in from farms in the surrounding areas of the city. In true Montreal form, the market braves the city’s harsh winters and is open year-long. In the summer there is fresh seafood from Quebec’s Gaspesie region and strawberries from a number of local farms. Spring boasts all things maple, and the market has endless stalls selling maple any and every which way anyone could hope for. There are rows of treats in endless maple combinations like maple candy, maple fudge, maple butter, and the classic, maple syrup. There’s sometimes “tire d’erable” (maple taffy) ready to sample, every Canadian’s favorite winter snack. During the harvest time there’s squash and pumpkins aplenty, Quebec cranberries and fresh cranberry and apple juice ready for purchase or to go. There’s a kiosk with more different types of mushrooms than you knew existed, close to 30. After you’ve browsed through the middle of the market, hands occupied with bags filled with fresh produce, head to the edges of the market to its many unique shops. There are specialty shops for fish (or “poissonneries”), prize-winning meats and cheeses, spices, bakeries, and pasta. There is much to browse, sample, and buy. Jean-Talon Market doesn’t miss a thing when it comes to food. In the middle of a busy city day, the market is always there and the farmers are waiting for you to sample a fresh tomato slice and take home a $2 bag before heading to the spice store to buy Moroccan mint and authentic Jamaican jerk spice from the experts. Then sit in the middle of the market and enjoy a crepe and a cup of coffee. Across from some of the best Turkish Delights you will find outside of Turkey, there is an amazing bakery stand that has wonderful Québécois desserts, such as pet de soeurs and maple pie.",markets food
162,Cheltenham Badlands,"Caledon, Ontario","These strikingly barren, rolling red hills were caused by bad farming practices.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cheltenham-badlands,"The Cheltenham Badlands are a series of bare, windswept red hills and gullies in southern Ontario that formed as a result of overgrazing. In the 1930s, the area was still productive farmlands, but poor farming practices resulted in the creation of the rolling martian landscape. As dirt and vegetation were worn away by the elements, the Queenston shale below the surface farmland was exposed. Unfortunately, the shale supports little or no vegetation, and has left the area as barren badlands. The reddish hue of the Badlands is caused by iron oxide, while narrow greenish bands show where groundwater has transformed the rock from red to green iron oxide. Care should be taken while visiting, as this area is very fragile. Visitors should not climb on the hills after a rainfall or when the ground appears soft. Violation of this unwritten rule will also result in a nasty reddish dirt stain that most travelers work to avoid while on vacation. As of August 2019, you can visit most of the Cheltenham Badlands in Ontario, however, check their website beforehand, as conservation projects are ongoing. You can no longer walk on the rocks, as they are fenced off, but there is a lookout platform to take in the view.  From Toronto take Hwy 427 to Hwy 401-W then 410 towards Brampton. Exit onto Hurontario-N and continue 9.6km. Turn left on Old Baseline Road and go 3.8km until you see the Badlands on your left. Physical access to walk on the badlands is no longer available, instead there is now a viewing platform and boardwalk. There are parking spaces adjacent to the boardwalk and a sidewalk that leads directly to a parking lot on Olde Base Line Road.",martian landscapes landscapes geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems geology nature
163,The Little House,"Toronto, Ontario",Smallest house in Toronto sits on a lot meant to be just wide enough for cars to drive through.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-little-house-toronto-ontario,"Built in 1912 by then well-known contractor Arthur Weeden, the Little House is just that, a little house. In fact, it’s the smallest house in all of Toronto and, probably, a much larger area. A simple house comes with a simple story: One day, Weeden noticed the tiny open lot on Day Avenue that was tucked between two existing houses and decided to build on it. Born in England, Weeden migrated to Canada in 1902, a full decade before he built the little house. For a time, he worked as the superintendent of the old Lighthouse Mission and later became known as one of the pioneer builders in this area of Toronto. Day Avenue, in fact, is still home to many of Weeden’s other projects. After he finished building the house, which is on a lot that was originally intended to serve as a small thruway for cars between these two existing houses, Weeden lived in it for twenty years with his wife. When she passed away, Weeden continued to live in the house for six more years. In 2007, the most recent owners renovated the entire space in an attempt to make it as useful and enjoyable as possible. Since, it has received considerable media attention and spurred features focused on tiny houses in several magazines.",eccentric homes homes architectural oddities architecture
164,Bankhead Ghost Town,"Bankhead, Alberta","The ruins of the ""20-year town"" lay out among the mountains of Alberta.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bankhead-ghost-town,"Once a bustling mining town operated by the Canadian Pacific Railroad, the crumbling ruins of Bankhead now lie abandoned up in the mountains of Banff National Park. Educational plaques and an interpretive trail tell the tale of what one historian dubbed “the twenty year town.” Bankhead was established as a company town in 1903 to provide coal to CPR locomotives and Banff Springs Hotel boilers. By 1905 the frontier community was dotted with homes, shops, community buildings, even a school. In its heyday, 300 men worked the mines beneath Bankhead and excavated 200,000 tons of coal per year. While the supply of coal underneath Bankhead was plentiful, actually getting at it was another matter. Much of the stuff lay in difficult to access folding and faulted seams that forced miners to dig an inefficient 185-mile-plus network of tunnels and ventilation shafts underneath the town. A historical brochure notes that the unusually brittle coal was far from ideal for the railroad. “As soon as it was exposed to the air, it began to crumble;” and at the end of the production line “nearly half of it was classified as ‘dust.” Bankhead was ultimately undone not by its coal but by poor relations between the miners and the railroad. In a decade known for its labor strikes, there were several walkouts in Bankhead that won the workers higher wages, but exacerbated the mine’s cashflow problems. An April 1922 strike broke the camel’s back, and CPR simply closed the coal mine. Since Bankhead was a company town all economic activity dried up with the mine, and the residents drifted away. In 1930 the National Parks Act forbade future logging or mining in Banff, and Bankhead’s fate as a ghost town was locked in place.",national parks mines railroads ghost towns mountains parks abandoned ruins history
165,Whistler Train Wreck,"Whistler, British Columbia",The remains of a Canadian train crash are now mouldering beneath layers of rust and graffiti.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/whistler-train-wreck,"Located along a hiking trail south of Whistler, British Columbia are a handful of crushed train cars that derailed from some nearby tracks and were simply left to rot away among the lush Canadian greenery. It was in 1956 that the train was speeding down the tracks with a load too heavy, going over twice as fast as it was supposed to. Given these factors, one of the cars ended up curling one of the tracks and the train partly derailed, grinding to a halt. The damaged cars were not flung from the tracks but instead had to be hauled off in a clean-up operation that moved the wrecks a bit deeper into the forest. Since the surrounding wildlife was not majorly damaged or destroyed, the cars were nearly instantly buried hidden in the overgrowth. Since the crash, the cars have become a favorite spot for graffiti artists and hikers looking to take in a bit of lovely ruination. In 2013, the site came to the attention of local authorities as access to the site trespassed on government land and required crossing the train tracks which is illegal. Visitors attempting to access the site were ticketed. In response to the popularity of the site an official trail and suspension bridge was built to access the Wreck in 2016.   A parking lot for the trail is located on Whistler Quarry Road. The hike is an easy two kilometers with a suspension bridge to cross the river.",graffiti railroads trains hidden

For the more academically inclined, the Collection holds vast numbers of non-fiction critical works relating to science fiction and fantasy, science fiction and fantasy art books, subject reference tools, limited editions, out-of-print materials, original manuscripts, correspondence, critical, biographical and bibliographical materials and audiovisual and multimedia materials. Reading materials are available to the public on a limited basis, but only in the Collection’s public reading rooms. Artwork is often displayed during frequent public events, exhibits and book launches. The history of the Merril Collection dates back to August 10, 1970, when an agreement was signed between legendary Canadian science fiction author and editor Judith Merril and the Board of the Toronto Public Library. In this agreement Judith Merril donated to the Toronto Public Library her collection of science fiction, fantasy, and associated non-fiction which contained around 5,000 items. This collection was named The Spaced Out Library.The Spaced Out Library was established as a reference collection of “contemporary speculative literature, including science fiction, certain aspects of fantasy fiction, satire, surrealist, and other speculative, future oriented, and conceptually experimental work, whether in fiction, poetry, drama, essay, or other forms as well as critical and bibliographic materials relating to science fiction and the associated areas of contemporary speculative writing” serving both scholars and the general public. In 1990 the collection was officially renamed The Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Speculation and Fantasy. Merril herself passed away in 1997.  All items in the Merill Collection are held in a section that only staff can access. Visitors must provide their valid photo ID and register with the staff in order to view, handle, or read any material.

167,Toronto's Half House,"Toronto, Ontario",Willy Wonka would love this weird half-a-home.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/toronto-s-half-house,"No, this isn’t a trick of Photoshop. Nor is it the world’s nastiest spite house; rather, this bonafide half-home shares more with its nail house brethren after witnessing a history of blight and zoning changes. The lone row home at 54 1/2 Saint Patrick Street dates back to Toronto’s slums in the late 19th century. Built somewhere between 1890 and 1893, this bay-and-gable relic from a bygone era once was a one of six identical, structurally intertwined homes on what was then known as Dummer Street. Time passed, the street names changed, and a particularly sharky land holdings company began buying up property throughout the neighborhood in the middle of the 20th century. Eventually, the owners of the row houses caved, but not as a unit. Each half of the row houses’ wholes were torn down at an excruciatingly slow pace… until 54 1/2 remained the only one left. This begs the question: how does half a building cleave away so cleanly only to leave the rest of it standing? Very carefully. In a miraculous feat performed with clumsy and powerful machinery, a demolition crew managed to tear down 54 1/2’s neighbor to the north with such precision as to not disturb any of the original facade on the building that was to remain. The white, exterior wall had once been a load-bearing wall hidden internally to divide the neighbors’ bedrooms and living rooms from each other. One slip with an excavator and the half-house would have come tumbling down. As of 2013, the house was reported to be privately owned and vacant. As it begins to show signs of wear, its status as last bastion of the neighborhood’s less pleasant days are beginning to show on its craggy, half-face. Then again, if any house has earned its character, it’s this one.",spite house fires architectural oddities architecture
168,The Rainbow Tunnel,"Toronto, Ontario",This colorful creation wasn't always a welcome part of Toronto's Moccasin Trail Park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-rainbow-tunnel-toronto-ontario,"If you’ve ever been a northbound driver on Toronto’s Don Valley Parkway, you may have noticed, for a split second, a colorful tunnel on the right side of the highway. Officially dubbed the Rainbow Tunnel by the City of Toronto, the bright mural has become a beloved part of the scenery. The rainbow wasn’t always a welcome part of the city. When it first appeared on the old railway tunnel in the early 1970s, the North York Parks department painted over the colorful piece of outsider art. The mural was the work of B.C. Johnson, a Norwegian teenager who decided to use his paintbrush to brighten up the dreary Toronto days and cheer up its residents. He originally painted it as a memorial to a friend who had passed away. He continued to repaint the rainbow each time it was removed. Community members even joined his quest to enliven the tunnel’s entrance. Eventually, the city learned to embrace the colorful creation. It had the rainbow revamped and restored to its former glory in 2013, with the help of an arts organization called Mural Routes. The tunnel’s interior also received a much-needed makeover. The Rainbow Tunnel can be reached from Moccasin Trail Park via a part of the East Don Trail. Despite its roadside location, the park itself is an urban oasis that acts like a serene getaway from the noise of the big city. You can walk right under the tunnel and along the Don River, where you may catch a sight of the salmon migration, if you’re lucky! There is parking at the entrance of Moccasin Trail Park. It's then an easy five minute walk to the tunnel.",rainbow trails tunnels railroads murals subterranean sites roadside attractions outsider art parks art
169,Yoho National Park,"Field, British Columbia","Fossils, railroads, and waterfalls!",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yoho-national-park,"Almost onomatopoetic, “Yoho” comes from the Cree word for “amazement.” Featuring the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Yoho National Park offers incredible scenic views and stunning waterfalls, as well as unusual mixture of prehistoric fossils and modern development. At 4,900 feet above sea level, the Burgess Shale was a boon for paleontologists when Charles Walcott discovered it in 1909. This sedimentary rock contains fossils from the Cambrian Era, more than 500 million years ago. These fossils, some of the oldest on earth, depict the first multicellular creatures on the planet. In particular, the Burgess Shale helps scientists because the fossils capture the soft parts of the bodies with remarkable clarity, an important factor when studying invertebrates. The fossils influenced the development of taxonomies and our understanding of early life on earth. (UNESCO declared the Shale a World Heritage Site in 1981.) Yoho also features one of the engineering marvels of the railroad era. To bridge the divide between Eastern and Western Canada, the government built a railroad in the late 1800s. And laying tracks across the Rocky Mountains is even harder than it sounds. The Chief Engineer on the project designed a tunnels to spiral in and out of the mountains. Rather than a direct climb, the train followed a switchback of sorts, emerging ever higher as it twisted out of the mountains. The Spiral Tunnels are on view as a historical site of Canada in Yoho. Part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, Yoho is connected to Banff, Jasper, and Kootenay National Parks. Grizzly bears live throughout these parks. There are 60 bears or so in total, including 16 reproductive females. They mostly live in the Northern portions of Banff National Park. The Canadian National Parks strive to protect the habitat of the endangered bear, while also protecting park visitors. Finally, the park has an unusual geological formation: a natural bridge.

But the opposite is true for the Redpath Museum. Built in 1882, the museum is named for its donor, Peter Redpath, who was a sugar baron and industrial magnate at the time. Redpath wanted to create a place for carefully curated natural history of every stripe, from geology to anthropology. And that’s exactly what the Redpath Museum is. The building rests on the campus of McGill University in Montreal, and shares a name with the Redpath Sugar Museum (what else?) in nearby Toronto. The building is old and beautiful, and its status as the quintessential “oddball” or just plain old museum have earned it use as a set in more than one film and television production. Colorful stuffed birds, fossils encased in stone, and, of course, dinosaur bones, inhabit every shelve and deck each hall in this much-loved location. The Evolution Exhibit features a massive Albertosaurus skeleton, which is appropriate for Canada, and is undoubtedly the main attraction. The museum is also home to a small collection of glass marine life models by the famous father and son team Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka. (More photos here.)

171,Gastown Steam Clock,"Vancouver, British Columbia","A working steam clock, one of only a few in the world, located in Vancouver's Victorian Gastown.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/steam-clock-gastown-vancouver,"Underneath Vancouver, Canada, there runs a series of steam pipes connected to a generating plant at Georgia and Beatty Streets. The system provides heat to most of the downtown core, and provides the steam for the whistles of the Gastown steam clock. Despite seeming like a remnant of the Victorian era and being located in Vancouver’s “Gastown” (which was the original townsite from which Vancouver grew in the 1870s), the Steam Clock is actually from a hundred years later, built in 1977 by horologist Raymond Saunders and metalwork specialist Doug Smith. Saunders was hired by Gastown’s local merchants to build the clock as a monument. It also had an alternative purpose: Placed over a steam grate above one of the aforementioned pipes, it kept local homeless from sleeping on the warm spot. The clock is likely only the second steam clock ever constructed, the first having been built by Englishman John Inshaw in 1859, to draw customers to his tavern. Because Inshaw’s clock was small and very inaccurate as a timekeeper, Saunders had to reinvent the steam clock from scratch. The new clock proved to be finicky and hard to keep running and required additional funds to get it working properly, around $58,000. Saying the clock is “steam-powered” is a bit of a misnomer, as the clockworks itself is powered by descending weights. The mini-steam engine at the base of the clock case takes up the role of the human “winder” by raising a series of ball weights and delivering the weights to the clock drive train. But the steam engine is connected by a rubber belt to an electric motor hidden from view - much more reliable than steam power. Every quarter-hour, the two-ton Steam Clock shows off a bit, whistling and shooting steam from its five whistles in its version of the Westminster Chime. On the hour it marks each hour with a toot from each whistle. There are six other working “Steam” Clocks in the world. The lesson was learned, though – only the whistles are steam and the clockworks are electric. The clock is a key tourists destination in Vancouver. It’s also the near the start and a finish line of the Gastown Grand Prix, a single-day cycling race.",amazing automata astounding timepieces retro-tech

Flowering Crocosmia plants sprout from her head, giving her what looks like a spiky haircut speckled with colorful blossoms. The sculpture, which seems to blend effortlessly with the surrounding nature, is a beautiful piece of artwork to stumble upon. The Moss Lady was constructed in 2015 and looks like she could be an identical twin to the Mud Maid in Cornwall’s Lost Gardens of Heligan. In fact, the Canadian version was directly inspired by the English artwork. Artist Dale Doebert began crafting the colossal creation in Victoria’s Beacon Hill Park after seeing photographs of the famous English gardens. He and the city park staff used a whole concoction of boulders, pipes, cement, and wire to build the roughly 35-foot-long woman. Doebert then covered the sculpture with a specially designed clay-based acidic soil so moss could cloak his creation. The peaceful expression on the sculpture’s face reflects the surroundings. A small stream gurgles nearby, making it seem like the woman was lulled to sleep by a watery lullaby. Carved wooden chairs and couches provide a calm resting spot for walkers who want to soak in the relaxing ambience.  The statue is located due east of the location provided by address.

173,Screaming Tunnel,"Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario",Legend says that this short Canadian tunnel still holds the dying screams of a girl who burned alive.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/screaming-tunnel,"While some would say that this arched stone tunnel running beneath the Grand Trunk railroad tracks in Niagara Falls is just that, but for those with ghost stories dancing around in their fevered imaginations, the dark passage is haunted by the screams of a girl 100 years dead. The tunnel is known as “Screaming Tunnel” and was created in the early 1900s not as a thoroughfare but as a drainage passage to keep the tracks from being lost beneath flood waters. The fact that it allowed local farmers a convenient path to avoid the oncoming trains overhead came only as a secondary use. Made from 125 feet of limestone bricks, the tunnel took on a haunted air early in its existence as moss and algae took hold of the porous stones. Given its eerie look, it is no wonder the simple tunnel became home to its own legend. According to one version of the story, a local farm near the tunnel caught fire one night and a young girl ran screaming from the blaze, hair and clothes alight. Before she could find help, the girl collapsed right in the middle of the tunnel, perishing from her burns. Assumedly this was not quite grisly enough for increasingly modern audiences, so another version of the story has also appeared in which the young girl is burnt to death in the tunnel by her father, mad with rage. Still another, even more disturbing version says that the girl was raped and her body burned to destroy the evidence. Undoubtedly the next iteration of the story will involve torture, incest, or some other escalation. In any event, all stories agree on the outcome: the girl’s spirit still haunts the tunnel and if a match is lit off the tunnel wall around midnight, you can hear her scream. While this is more likely to be a late night train passing overhead, the legend has proven pervasive enough to completely rebrand the otherwise unremarkable tunnel in the popular conscience.  Given the eerie atmosphere, the tunnel may not be suitable for children. Note: it leads to the Bruce Trail, a great hiking trail.",ghost stories ghosts tunnels subterranean sites

It contains large amounts of magnesium sulfate, calcium, and sodium sulfates, along with other minerals and traces of silver and titanium. In summer when water evaporates in the desert climate, these minerals are revealed in the “spots” of the lake’s name. At that point, it would be possible to walk between the salt crystal polka dots through the dry sections of the lake. (However, a fence at the site limits access and trespassing on the delicate natural wonder is not advised.) In World War I, these salts were used in the manufacturing of explosives.

The fountain honors the four-legged visitors who frequent this neighborhood spot.

But dogs aren’t the only creatures you’ll find here—keep an eye out for a cat, too. The dogs all have their eyes glued to the giant bone that crowns the fountain. Meanwhile, the cat stares off into the distance, its gazed fixed on the two bird sculptures perched on a lampost. The cheery fountain is part of the park’s playful redesign by Claude Cormier and Associates. Unfortunately for the cat, the name of its breed isn’t said on the architect’s website, making it clear that this fountain really is for the dogs. The cat, which sits with a fearful expression on its face near a German Shepherd, also doesn’t partake in the water-spitting festivities. A few of the 27 dog breeds featured at the fountain are: Fox Terrier, St.Bernard, Dalmatian, West Highland Terrier, Great Dane, Jack Russell Terrier, St.Bernard, Giant Schnauzer, Golden Retriever, Beagle, Pug, and the Bernese Mountain Dog just to name a few.

The Ainu are an indigenous people native to northern Japan (as well as Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, both part of Russia). At the heart of their traditional territory is the Japanese island of Hokkaido; on the southeastern coast of Hokkaido is the city of Kushiro, home of Toko Nuburi and sister city to Burnaby, British Columbia. Toko — already an internationally renowned artist, with commissioned works around the world — visited Burnaby as part of a special delegation from Kushiro in 1985. During the visit, he happened upon a mountaintop visit that inspired him. After successfully pitching his idea for a large wooden sculpture, Toko and his son Shusei began work on the project in 1989, using facilities and logs provided by the city of Burnaby. Playground of the Gods (or Kamui Mintara, in Japanese) was completed and unveiled in 1990, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the special relationship between the two cities. Playground of the Gods draws on Ainu animist tradition, with animal totems representing the gods descending to create the world, while the smaller surrounding poles represent the Ainu’s intertwined relationship with the divine. The overall overlapping associations among humans, gods, animals, and nature symbolizes the friendship between Burnaby and Kushiro.

177,Arthur Conan Doyle Room,"Toronto, Ontario",One of the foremost Sherlock Holmes collections is hidden away at a Toronto library.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arthur-conan-doyle-room,"It takes a shrewd detective to find one of the world’s foremost collections of library materials devoted to the life and work of Arthur Conan Doyle and his Sherlock Holmes stories. Tucked away on the top floor of the Toronto Reference Library, the Arthur Conan Doyle Room is one of the city’s best-kept secrets. For those who make the effort, it’s well worth it. The collection is housed in a room decorated to look like Sherlock Holmes’ apartment at 221B Baker Street, London, with Victorian-era chairs, a Persian carpet, floor-to-ceiling wooden bookshelves, and a scattering of memorabilia and paraphernalia. The room is decorated with busts, statues, dolls, paintings, and posters of Sherlock Holmes, meerschaum pipes and deerstalker hats (two of his most famous emblems, which, ironically, never appeared in the stories; they were added by actors playing the role), and oddities such as a chess set with pieces carved to resemble Holmes, his sidekick Dr. Watson, and other characters from the series. The collection includes books, stories, and essays by Arthur Conan Doyle on spiritualism, true crime, history, and current issues of the day. He also wrote in several literary genres. But his most famous character, Sherlock Holmes, eclipsed his other writings, and this is reflected in the collection. The collection includes many versions of the Sherlock Holmes series, from the original magazines the stories appeared in, to first editions and modern imprints; from translations to adaptions for stage and screen. There’s also lots of books about both Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, as well as books, called pastiches, by other authors that make use of Doyle’s characters. Mark Twain was one of the first to write this kind of early “fan fiction.” The collection also includes secondary material, such as critical, bibliographical, and biographical studies, published by university presses, commercial publishers, individuals, the many societies devoted to Sherlock Holmes. The collection was established in 1969 with the purchase of more than 150 volumes from the estate of Arthur Baillie, a Toronto collector. Over the years, it grew via a mixture of donations and acquisitions, and took up its current residence when the Toronto Reference Library and moved to its current location downtown. Though this is, in fact, a rare book collection, patrons are allowed to touch and read the materials at their leisure. And this makes it an even more extraordinary place. The collection is accessed through the Marilyn & Charles Baillie Special Collections Centre on the 5th floor of the Toronto Reference Library.",libraries books literature collections

Built in 1969, the conservatory is housed under a massive triodetic dome consisting of a number of connected glass bubbles. Beneath the modernist dome is a lush garden wonderland comprised of three distinct biomes: tropical rainforest, subtropical rainforest, and desert. Among the distinct environments, over 500 species and varietals of plant life thrive far from their native climes. Coffee trees and fig trees share space with exotic ferns and lilies. In addition to sheltering the varied flora the space also acts as an aviary, housing over 100 birds which are free to soar under the tall dome. The brightly colored birds and verdant walking trails create a veritable Eden. Maintaining the incredible garden in the Bloedel Conservatory is a pretty expensive endeavor and the site has had a number of funding issues but continual support from multiple investors has allowed the conservatory to carry on its conservation efforts.",domes birds gardens plants animals
179,BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto,"Toronto, Ontario",This Hindu temple is an architectural marvel designed and built according to ancient Indian principles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baps-shri-swaminarayan-mandir-toronto,"The BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Toronto is Canada’s first hand-carved stone and marble Hindu temple built according to ancient Indian principles, in a tradition that dates back many millennia. It’s a stunning structure that evokes the mystical beauty and spiritual essence of India. Carved entirely of white marble and limestone, the mandir (a Hindu place of worship) was designed using traditional engineering principles without the use of steel or nails, or reinforcement from ferrous material, even in the foundations. The temple was made by about 1,800 craftsmen in Rajasthan, India, and then shipped to Canada. The 24,000 hand-carved stone pieces were reassembled by 101 volunteer artisans from India, who lived on the construction site for two years. Using building techniques that have been handed down from generation to generation by craftsmen in India, they assembled more than 95,000 cubic feet of stone that included 2,638 tonnes of Turkish limestone, 2,260 tonnes of Carrara marble, and 1,484 tonnes of Indian pink sandstone. The stone was shipped to Canada in containers weighing up to 5.6 tonnes. Among the many impressive features of the mandir are the 340 pillars, out of which 112 are intricately carved; 132 archways; and a series of domes, pinnacles, and stone crowns. The temple is a meditation zone, requiring visitors to maintain silence. Several daily rituals take place in the mandir, which visitors can attend, such as the Aarti and the Abhishek ritual. The complex includes a Haveli intricately hand-carved in Burmese teak. The Haveli is a welcome courtyard with an entrance lobby that features hundreds of carved figures of musicians, poets and dancers. Wooden columns and panels depict hundreds of dancing peacocks, lotus flowers, and royal elephants. There’s also an ongoing exhibition on Understanding Hindu Dharma, which showcases the rich heritage of India. The Toronto mandir is part of a network of traditional Hindu temples built across the world, such as the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Atlanta and BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Sanstha Mandir outside Chicago.  Visitors are welcome to the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. daily. Parking and entrance is free, and visitors must abide by the rules of decorum and dress code. Shorts, short skirts, and sleeveless tops are not allowed. Visitors are required to remove shoes upon entering. Photography is not allowed, except outside the Mandir.

180,Banff Springs Hotel,"Banff, Alberta",Few other hotels can rival the grandeur of the Castle in the Rockies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/banff-springs-hotel,"A former Canadian Pacific Railway hotel built in the Scottish Baronial style, the Banff Springs Hotel has been called the Castle in the Rockies. Few other hotels in North America can rival its grandeur. Tucked in Alberta’s Banff National Park, the hotel was built between 1887 and 1888 and opened to the public that year. At the time, though, the hotel looked almost nothing like it does today. The original 1888 structure was clad in shingles with stone accents, and featured a dormers, turrets, and roof lines. The building, in a sense, was a $250,000 mistake; the builder goofed and changed the intended orientation of the building, turning its back on the mountain vista. A major overhaul in 1906 began with the construction of the Painter Tower, named after chief architect Walter Painter, which was the tallest building in Canada upon completion. The eleven story tower, made of concrete and stone, was filled with 300 guest rooms and flanked by two large wings that were added later. The renovations weren’t completed until 1928. A UNESCO World Heritage site, the Banff Springs Hotel is currently operated and owned by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. As it is within walking distance of Banff and, though it offers championship golf courses, the primary recreational attractions are winter-based, the hotel was weatherized in 1968 and has been open year-round ever since. The world renowned skiing continues to draw visitors, but the hotel’s grand spa is also a major attraction. Solace Spa offers separate dressing and shower areas, private massage rooms, whirlpools, and aromatherapy saunas. All of those amenities are complemented by waterfalls, a salt-water pool, and other fresh-water pools of various sizes and temperatures. This iconic Canadian railway hotel has long said to be haunted. Look for the grand staircase where a bride is said to have fallen and broken her neck on her wedding day in the 1920's.

181,CN Tower Stairs,"Toronto, Ontario",One of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World holds the world's tallest metal staircase.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cn-tower,"While Toronto’s CN Tower no longer holds the world record for tallest building in the world, it still holds the record for the world’s tallest metal staircase. The idea for the CN Tower originated from the 1968 Canadian National Railway’s desire to build a large television and radio communication platform that would serve the Toronto area and demonstrate the strength of Canada and its industry. It surpassed the height of the Ostankino Tower while still under construction in 1975, becoming the tallest free-standing structure on land in the world for the next 31 years. The concrete structure stands at 553 meters (1,815 feet) tall. Inside, a metal staircase winds through the tower. It takes 1,776 steps to reach the main deck, and 2,579 steps to reach the SkyPod level. The stairs are not typically open to the public—they’re intended for emergency use only—but twice a year visitors who want to scale the massive structure have the opportunity to join charity stair-climbing events. On average, climbers take about half an hour to complete the climb. The record for fastest climb is held by Brendan Keenoy, who reportedly managed the feat in seven minutes and 52 seconds in 1989—though the accuracy of his time has been the subject of debate. The CN Tower’s claim as the world’s tallest free-standing structure was surpassed on September 12, 2007 by the Burj Khalifa (formerly known as Burj Dubai). It has since also been surpassed by the Guangzhou TV & Sightseeing Tower, which was completed in 2009. Today, the Toronto tower is the ninth tallest free-standing structure in the world, and still holds the title of tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. Despite this, the CN Tower remains the signature icon of Toronto’s skyline, and a symbol of Canada.

182,Hôtel de Glace,"Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier, Québec",This chilly Canadian hotel has a four-month lifespan due to the unusual material it's made of.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-de-glace,"Comprised of 15,000 tons of snow and 500,000 tons of ice, the Hôtel de Glace is a massive undertaking, yet each spring it completely disappears. With only a four-month lifespan, the Ice Hotel takes a month and a half and 60 full-time workers to finish its rooms, but the result is a spectacular blend of chilly, natural architecture and ambient pastel light. Altogether, the hotel features 85 bedrooms along with a club, art gallery, and even a chapel that usually hosts a handful of weddings. Every inch of the hotel is created out of ice, including the furniture. To make the rooms more livable, beds are covered with furs, blankets and sleeping bags tested to arctic temperatures. The only areas of the hotel that are heated are a few outdoor bathrooms, along with a few outdoor hot tubs to add to the experience. Considered an example of a pure ice structure, the hotel is not supported by anything except the icy walls, which can be as thick as four feet to insulate the hotel. Although you might not get four-star service, the Hôtel de Glace is certainly a unique experience as it changes in layout and complexity every year. Update: Starting in the 2016-2017 season, the Hôtel de Glace moved to its new location at the Village Vacances Valcartier Resort.",ice hotels places to stay outsider architecture hotels architectural oddities architecture
183,Cube House,"Toronto, Ontario",This unusual structure may be on its way to becoming a cultural landmark in Toronto.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cube-house-toronto,"This unusual structure is well known to motorists who drive past it going to and from the Don Valley Parkway in Toronto. The project was built by architect Ben Kutner and his partner Jeff Brown in 1996. It has been occupied as a private residence and used as a billboard at various stages of its existence. The Cube House design was inspired by similar cube homes built in Rotterdam and Helmond in the 1970s. Piet Blom was the architect of those original structures. He thought of them as  “trees” with living space branching out from a trunk-like base. Groups of such homes became “forests”. Cube House has been at the centre of legal wrangles about land ownership and the eventual fate of the building is uncertain. Kutner and Brown built the single structure with the hopes of incorporating it into a larger residential community they called “unitri.” However, they did not own the land they built on and the actual landowner did not agree with their plan. In the end, the landowner was deemed to be the legal owner of the building, rather than Kutner and Brown. In 2016, the land was put on the market and is expected to be bought by a developer. If that happens, the structure will likely be torn down to make way for a larger residential building. Though you’ll find it on the side of an elevated highway, it’s close to the popular Corktown district and newly developed neighbourhood, the Canary District (which had been the location of the athlete’s village for the 2015 Pan Am Games).",houses homes architecture
184,Niagara Falls Whirlpool Aero Car,"Niagara Falls, Ontario",Soaring over the Niagara Whirlpool since 1916.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/niagara-falls-spanish-aerocar,"Designed by renowned Spanish engineer, Leonardo Torres Quevedo, the Whirlpool Aero Car has been soaring the Niagara Gorge since 1916. The antique cable car is suspended from six sturdy cables and offers spectacular views of the swirling Niagara Whirlpool and the Class 6 whitewater rapids of the Niagara River. Although the Whirlpool Aero Car travels between two points on the Canadian shore, riders of this historic cable car actually cross the international border line between Canada and the United States a total of four times each trip due to the way the river elbows. The Aero Car was designed by Spanish engineer and inventor Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, who, in addition to other cable trams, also developed the first form of radio control unit, a famous chess playing automaton, non-rigid airships that were used by the French in WWI, and what may be the first mechanical computer (now on display at the Technical University of Madrid). He was also a vigorous supporter and user of the Esperanto. The son of a railway engineer, he built his first cable tram in Spain in 1887, the log seat was pulled by cows over a span of some 200 feet. The Whirlpool Aero Car is a somewhat more sophisticated design. Suspended on six interlocking steel cables for safety, and powered by a small motor, the Aerocar holds 35 passengers for a 10 round-minute trip over the Niagara whirlpool. The whirlpool itself is a basin 1700 feet by 1200 feet, where the rushing waters create a counterclockwise vortex around the pool. The tramway crossing over the whirlpool was the idea of J. Enoch Thompson (for whom the tram departure spot “Thompson Point” is named), a Niagara local, and it was designed and built by the all-Spanish team of the The Niagara Spanish Aerocar Co. Limited. The tram opened for service in 1916, spanning 1800 feet and riding at a height of 250 feet over the water at each end of the cables, with a low of 150 feet in the center. Niagara Falls has long been associated with daredevil stunts of varying levels of bravery or lunacy. In the summer of 1975, a French high wire artist named Henri Rechatin arrived in the predawn hours with his wife, a specially modified motorcycle, and a moto-cross driver with no previous high-wire experience. At 6:30 am they set out across the Aerocar cable, Henri balanced above, his wife Janyck hanging below by her feet. When the wind picked up, Henri walked the final 15 feet to the northern terminal, pulled the motorcycle in, and waited in the Aerocar for the operator to arrive. The three were arrested but never charged. Rechatin returned for other nearby high wire stunts in 1976, but stayed over land instead of the falls. His repeated requests for an encore performance were refused by the Niagara Commission. That the separate fourpassenger rescue car has only ever been used in training is a testament to the remarkable safety record of the Aero Car, and the integrity of the turn of the century design. It has been in continuous operation since its opening in 1916 (except for occasional maintenance periods) and is the only tram like it in the world. Parking is free. Sunday is the busiest day but the line moves quickly.  There is a gift shop, food, and restrooms at the location.  Three miles north of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls.",retro-tech

Like any country, however, Canada has its seamy underbelly, and the Vancouver Police Museum (formerly called the Vancouver Police Centennial Museum) aims to show just that, taking visitors on a a macabre trip through the darker side of this Western Canadian city. Started in 1986 by Joe Swan, a former police sergeant and amateur historian, the museum is housed in a old brick “heritage” building which, only six years before, was the Coroner’s Court and autopsy facilities. The morgue has since been turned into part of the museum and can be toured. Located in Vancouver’s Gastown - a historically seedy neighborhood, now a tourist attraction - the museum houses a collection of approximately 20,000 objects, including confiscated firearms and other weapons, counterfeit currency, police uniforms, archival documents, photographs, publications, and various other artifacts and memorabilia. Among its more curious exhibits are a painted skull sent into the Vancouver Police Department, an exhibit of the police officers who have died in the line of duty since 1886, some fairly intense anatomical specimens left over from crime analysis, the “milkshake murderer exhibit,” and—in the behind-the-scenes area, which you can see on a tour—the “blood drying room,” where blood soaked evidence was once hung to dry. The museum also offers a walking tours of the neighborhood on the theme “Sins of the City,” which takes you into the basements and alleyways of Vancouver and through the history of bootlegging, prostitution, and murder in the city. You can follow the surprisingly hip museum on “Off the Cuff” (their blog), Twitter, and Facebook.  By Car The museum is located on Cordova Street, which is one block north of Hastings. There is extensive metered parking in the blocks surrounding the museum, costing $1 per hour. Please note that Cordova Street is a one-way (eastbound) street. By Public Transit Both the #4 Powell and the #7 Nanaimo bus routes can be boarded near Granville or Waterfront Skytrain Stations and both stop a few hundred feet from the Police Museum.

Uli was born in Austria, and formerly owned a steel factory. Upon retirement he spent two (to five, depending on your source) years constructing these stairs by hand, a few hours each day. At the time, there were no other stairs nearby to connect upper and lower Hamilton. These stairs were completed in 2007, despite looking a lot older. The stairs are constructed primarily from natural stone, but also include what looks like manufactured stone or concrete in a few spots, and the handrails are long tree branches wired into place. The lower portion of the stairs, which begins at Greenhill Ave., just off of the Bruce trail, meets up with the Hamilton Rail Trail halfway up. This section is has a relatively gradual incline, and is easy to navigate. The stairs continue from the Rail Trail and exit out onto Mountain Brow Blvd. and Fennel Ave. on the “mountain.” This upper section is where the adventure is, since the incline is much sharper and the stairs are very close together, often offering only 3-4 inches of space for your foot. The stairs are punctuated with handmade benches and rest areas, and garden planters, complete with flowers. Perhaps the most charming part of the stairs are the signs, which look to be also handmade by Uli, warning adventurers of the risk inherent in using the adventure stairs. The City followed suit, posting their own signage basically telling folks not to use the stairs at all. Ignore this, and set off on your own adventure.

The swamp forests in this area and others produced so much organic matter over millions of years that the coal deposits created from them gave their name to the period. Joggins Fossil Cliffs, the most complete fossil record of life during this period anywhere in the world, were discovered by Nova Scotian geologist Sir William Dawson. Frozen in place are trees that still stand where they grew millions of years ago, the footprints of numerous creatures and the earliest reptiles entombed in hollow logs. Dawson himself uncovered the fossil of Hylonomus lyelli, which remains the earliest known reptile in the history of life on earth. It was named the provincial fossil of Nova Scotia in 2002. The site is considered so perfect that it was mentioned in Charles Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species.” Geologists were first attracted to the area in the 1820s and have been visiting it ever since. The coastal exposure of the Coal Age rocks means new fossils once buried deep within the structure are constantly making their way to the surface for new scientists to find and study. While the cliffs are high at 75 feet, the area is subjected to some of the highest tides in the world, frequently measuring nearly 50 feet tall. In 2008, a 15 kilometer length of the coast that includes Joggins Fossil Cliffs was added to the World Heritage List. Joggins, Nova Scotia, is located on the upper Bay of Fundy.

Located about more than 180 miles southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, the island, which is nearly 25 miles long and made entirely of sand, is a low-lying stretch of land in the middle of the ocean. Due to the island’s low profile and isolated placement, the oversized sandbar also has a long legacy of shipwrecks thereby earning the island the moniker, “Graveyard of the Atlantic.” In addition to shipwrecks, Sable Island is known for its population of some 400 feral horses that have lived there ever since their ancestors were introduced in the 18th century. In addition to the Sable Island Ponies, harbor and grey seals breed on the island’s shores without any human interference. Although this is one location where tourists don’t flock to, many are becoming fascinated with the island’s mythical description and interest in the site is growing. Luckily the island and its horses are protected by the Canadian government as a national park. At the moment, only a small number of scientists live on the island to study more about the island’s flora and fauna. Any potential visitors must actually clear their visit with the Canadian military. Not even wild horses could drag travelers to the island without permission. The island has an odd mix of two climate categories, humid continental, and the milder end of sub-polar oceanic, due to Gulf Stream influence, summers are also kept below 75 degrees Fahrenheit almost always by the cold Labrador current. One could compare its climate to that of a coastal environment in maybe a country like Denmark. It lies in USDA hardiness zone 8a (minimum winter temperature 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit and highest zone anywhere in eastern Canada, a place of the same zone with warm or hot summers would be considered at the lower end of humid subtropical), but due to constant cold saline winds and sandy soil, trees are not really able to grow and the only woody species to be found here are very stout wild roses and cranberries and possibly a dwarf birch or two. In the early 20th century, many trees were brought from Ottawa to plant experimentally back before anyone cared or was aware of what this could do. Only a single Scots Pine (a native of northern and alpine Europe and western Siberia) has survived and grows in the research station as a pathetic-looking sort of natural bonsai, dwarfed by the elements. Brackish pools exist in the interior of the island where the ocean is about one mile away on either side, and are home to a unique species of sponge. Despite the relatively mild temperatures, the island is often subject to snowfall as heavy as it is on the much colder mainland, due to high atmospheric moisture and heavy precipitation.",animal week horses shipwrecks islands natural wonders water nature animals

Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Mr. Rodgers? The Incredible Hulk or Yoda? Captain Kirk or Mighty Mouse? Maybe artist Andrew Lamb couldn’t decide, so he’s hired all of the above, and many, many more, for Neighbourhood Watches all over Toronto. Neighbourhood Watch signs in Canada are usually a regular, mundane sight. But when Lamb saw many of them fading, falling into disrepair or being defaced, pasting over their red and white house/eyeball graphic with pop culture protectors of the 1980s and 90s seemed logical.

But others neighbourhoods are being valiantly protected by the mom and dad from Little House on the Prairie, Care Bears, and the cast of Kindergarten Cop.

The statue was installed in 2009 for the Vancouver Convention Centre Art Project. Coupland created the whale to evoke the harbor area’s history with a common sight off the western coast, the killer whale. Given Coupland’s penchant for exploring technology in his prose, it is no surprise that he has also introduced an element of technology even when creating an homage to the natural world. Since it is permanently installed there by the seaside, the angular whale had to be built of of sturdy aluminum and coated with a protective powder coating making up the whale’s markings. Even though the whale is sturdy enough to handle the corrosive effects of the coastal weather, climbing on the craggy beast is not allowed.

By the late 1970s, Mrs. Bata’s shoe collection grew too large for her private storage space. To accommodate her growing footwear collection, Mrs. Bata’s family decided to establish the Bata Shoe Museum Foundation, an organization dedicated to footwear research and a place where Mrs. Bata could share all her beloved shoes. The extensive collection was on display at various offices in Toronto before moving to its present location in 1995. Designed by architect Raymond Moriyama, the museum building is shaped like an open shoe box, and is meant to reflect the notion of a museum as a “container.” Indeed, the museum contains over 12,500 pairs of shoes that span 4,500 years of history, making it the world’s largest collection of shoes and footwear-related objects. The museum’s tagline, “For the Curious,” seems appropriate for its visitors, given that the comprehensive collection ranges from Sixteenth-century Venetian velvet platforms to Elvis Presley’s famous “blue suede shoes.” Exhibitions have included French artist Thierry Agnone’s paper shoes, “The Charm of Rococo: Femininity and Footwear of the 18th Century,” as well as “Bound for Glory: Cutting-Edge Winter Sports Footwear.” Mrs. Bata insists that her shoe collection is more about history than mere aesthetics. Throughout each exhibit, the shoes on display present a story about the region from which they came. The shoes not only indicate simple truths – such as a region’s climate or the style of the period – but Mrs. Bata argues that, viewed chronologically, they can also signify a society’s shifts in technological development or changes in the attitudes and values of the time.",collections
195,Schwartz's,"Montreal, Québec",A Montreal deli that was so beloved that it was allowed to circumvent their laws of language.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/schwartz-s,"If you are a resident of Montreal’s hip neighbourhood the “Plateau” on the Main, you’re fated to spend at least a few moments of your day dodging tourists lined up outside Schwartz’s, a historic Montreal deli. The area now houses a slew of coffee shops, local theatres, fancy boutiques and a few pharmacies while Schwartz’s stands as a representation of Montreal at the beginning of the 20th century. Schwartz’s has been proud to serve as a Montreal establishment for over 90 years. It was founded in 1928 by Reuben Schwartz, a Jewish immigrant from Romania. The deli hasn’t changed locations since, and still displays its original name, “Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen” beneath its newer moniker. Walking through its doors is a time warp, as well as a sensory overload. The potent smell of decades of meat marinating fill the air while black and white photos of past patrons adorn the walls, between which tourists and some locals alike munch on cheap grub. The deli is proud to serve all chemical- and preservative-free items. While a few other delis remain in the area, Schwartz’s continues to be one of the most frequented in the city. The secret is in the Schwartz’s speciality spices, not to mention the timely process of cooking the meat. The meat is smoked daily and then marinated for ten days. So beloved is the restaurant that when Quebec declared the official language of the province to be French, Schwartz’s was specifically allowed to retain the apostrophe in its name despite no such grammar mark being used in the language. The gesture may seem small, but it is quite telling in the fiercely Francophone province. Celine Dion and her husband Rene Angelil, along with the well-known restauranteur Paul Nakis, bought the establishment for 10 million dollars in 2012. There is no news yet on whether the new ownership will change anything about this iconic deli.",restaurants
196,RAPS Cat Sanctuary,"Richmond, British Columbia","One of the largest cat sanctuaries in North America is considered a ""Club Med"" for felines.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/raps-cat-sanctuary,"RAPS Cat Sanctuary—or the Regional Animal Protection Services Cat Sanctuary—was built to house and protect the many homeless cats and kittens in Richmond. Now considered one of the largest cat sanctuaries in North America, this veritable Camp for Cats is now a safe, forever home for feral, abandoned, and surrendered felines. Operating in British Columbia, the philosophy of RAPS is simple: “no animal will be euthanized unless it is absolutely unavoidable.” According to the RAPS website, “every life is precious and every animal—not only the young, the healthy, the attractive and the docile—deserves a chance to be safe, healthy and loved.” The RAPS cat sanctuary is made up of three main buildings, a dozen smaller buildings, and two main courtyards. Enclosures connected to the main buildings provide indoor cats a chance to enjoy fresh air and sunshine, while fenced outside yards and cedar cottages are home to more than 500 free-roaming cats. The grounds that the cats enjoy are lovely, featuring gardens abundant with flowers planted by volunteers. The RAPS sanctuary is funded by private donations and has over 100 active volunteers. Considered a “Club Med for Cats,” the sanctuary is a paradise for animal-lovers who are keen to help furry friends or adopt a new pet. Beyond cats, the RAPS also operates the City of Richmond no-kill animal shelter housing surrendered or abandoned animals of all shapes and sizes. For those keen to support RAPS, there is an opportunity to sponsor one of the over 400 homeless cats that live at the sanctuary. For less than a dollar a day, sponsorship goes towards the ongoing medical attention and care to keep these felines healthy. Likewise, adoption is available—and often the goal—to give one of these animals a warm, forever home.  The Sanctuary is open to the public Saturdays and Sundays, 1 pm - 4 pm. Admission is $10 at the door, or $12 in advance (which includes a $2 service charge). Tickets can be purchased through the Sanctuary's website. Donations of dry and wet cat food are also encouraged. Children under the age of six are not permitted, while kids under the age of 13 must be supervised at all times. While it may be tempting to pet every cat that comes across your path, not all cats at the sanctuary are receptive to humans. Pet with caution. There are band-aids and antiseptics available on-premise, in the bathrooms. For visitors, parking is extremely limited so taking public transport is encouraged.",
197,Wood Buffalo National Park,"Improvement District No. 24, Alberta",The world's largest dark sky preserve is a Canadian park established to preserve the country's last wood bison.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wood-buffalo-national-park,"Established in 1922, Canada’s Wood Buffalo National Park is considered an excellent example of a successful, yet ongoing battle to save several species - both plant and animal - around us. The park comprises some of the largest segments of undisturbed grass and sedge meadows on the entire North American continent. It’s critical that the grass be left undisturbed as it sustains the largest remaining herd of wood bison, a threatened species. It is estimated that the world’s population of wood bison dropped from 40 million in 1830 to less than 1,000 in 1900. (There were only 23 in Yellowstone at this time.) The park is also used by many different birds as a place of rest along their migratory routes. The area is the only breeding habitat left in the world for the whooping crane, another endangered species. The cranes breed on the park’s salt plains, one of four distinct regions within the vast boundaries. The bird, imposing at more than 5 feet tall with black-tipped wings, was down to 15 known individuals in 1941. By 1994, their numbers had climbed to 133. In Wood Buffalo, the whooping crane shares space with geese, sandhill cranes, swans, ducks, white pelicans, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and many other species of birds that migrate north across the continent. Another attraction that the park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site as well as the largest park in all of Canada, boasts is the largest inland delta in the world, situated at the mouth of the Peace and Athabasca rivers. The park is known for promoting a long-standing tradition of native subsistence. There are a number of people who live, hunt and fish inside of the park’s boundaries, but their activities are considered sustainable. Evidence of artifacts of instruments suggest man has lived in the area for around 9,000 years, though Europeans didn’t arrive until the 18th century when searching for a Northwest Passage. The park isn't that easy to visit, but it is connected to the rest of the world by road. To get there you have to drive around the park to the community of Fort Smith, which sits on the border of Alberta and NWT. It is highly recommended to take a flightseeing tour over the park as most of it is inaccessible by car or even by foot.",dark skies world's largest natural history natural wonders plants nature animals
198,Burntcoat Head Park,"Maitland, Nova Scotia","The highest tides in the world come in and out here twice a day, allowing you to essentially walk along the ocean floor.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burntcoat-head-park,"When you drive onto Burntcove Road, you’ll see an amazing vista to your right: a vast red clay landscape stretching out into the distance. It’s part of the Bay of Fundy, and if you see red, the tide is out. Keep driving. When you get to Burntcoat Head Park, you’ll walk over a green, treed hill. It’s unbelievably quiet there, even when there are lots of people. Walk past the lighthouse, past the apple trees, and you’ll see a lookoff that gives you a phenomenal, unobstructed view of Cape Split in the distance, as well as Cobequid Bay. This part of the Bay of Fundy is home to the highest tide range in the world, averaging about 38.4 feet (about 12 meters), with a record of around 53 feet (16 meters). About 160 billion tonnes of water flow in and out of the basin twice a day. It allows for the rare and amazing experience of essentially walking on the ocean floor. When the tide is out, you are walking on ground that will soon be covered with so much water that all but the top of the large “Flowerpot” rock formation will be swallowed by the sea. From the minute you climb down the stone stairs (which are underwater when the tide is in), you will feel as if you’re on another planet. You’ll walk over rocks encrusted with tiny barnacles (they’re almost like a spa treatment if you’re barefoot), and have closeup and personal encounters with hundreds of tiny hermit crabs, busily dragging their houses around rock pools warmed from the sun. You can climb into sea caves here and look out at the bay. You will see seaweed that is an astonishing shade of iridescent green. And you won’t even mind when your feet squelch into the red clay, because you’ll be too busy saying “Whoa!” every time you realize just where you are.  It is an easy drive from Halifax, the closest city. Check the tide charts to time your visit for when the tide is out. Once it starts coming in, it will run very fast, and people have actually been trapped on the rock. So you'll want to be very careful.",seaweed sea fish oceans parks natural wonders water nature
199,The Empress Hotel,"Victoria, British Columbia",This historic Victorian hotel has a scandalous history of affairs and murder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-empress-hotel-victoria-british-columbia,"Visitors to the city of Victoria on Vancouver Island, may be forgiven for thinking that they had stepped back in time to the glorious days of the British Empire, and that they had arrived at the furthest outpost of it. Even the local newspaper, the Times Colonist has the ring of Queen Victoria to it. And one young English architect did more than anyone to perpetuate this feeling. Arriving in Canada from England in 1891, the 24 year old Francis Rattenbury would go on to design many of the magnificent Imperial buildings that give Victoria’s inner harbour its grand sweep. Visitors would disembark at his Canadian Pacific Railway steamship terminal, walk past the majestic British Columbia Parliament buildings, and arrive at the doorsteps of his beaux-arts masterpiece, the Empress Hotel. Built between 1904 and 1908, the Empress soon became one of the world’s most famous hotels. Formidably overlooking the harbour, the grand hotel became a byword in Edwardian luxury. For many years the hotel didn’t have a sign above the door; when one was finally installed, it was reported that a gentleman, watching the workmen raise the sign, remarked, “Anyone who doesn’t know this is The Empress shouldn’t be staying here.” And still today, the Empress is an exquisite throwback to the days when Great Britain ruled the waves. The hotel serves afternoon tea in the Lobby to over 800 visitors a day. Cocktails are served on the veranda. The Empress has played host to film stars and royalty; in the 1920s the young Prince of Wales danced until morning in the Crystal Ballroom, a room covered in so much crystal that it advertised itself as “dancing under the stars.” In the basement, the hotel keeps a rarely-visited archive, containing old ledgers, menus, photographs and cutlery. There, the press room archives record that “almost 50 years later, the obituaries of elderly ladies would appear under headlines such as, ‘Mrs. Thornley-Hall Dies. Prince of Wales Singled Her Out.’” But whilst the hotel continues its life of opulence and luxury today, its creator did not fare so well. By the early 1920s, Francis Rattenbury was married and had two children. He had just had his architectural plans for Victoria’s new grandiose swimming pool accepted. The Crystal Garden would go on to be where Johnny Weismuller would set the world record for the 100 metres. Rattenbury retired to the Empress to celebrate, and that evening, whilst smoking a cigar, he met the 27 year old beauty Alma Pakenham. They fell in love, and their passionate affair shocked conservative Victoria. Deserting his family, he sailed with her for England and the quiet seaside town of Bournemouth. And it was here in 1935 that Rattenbury was murdered in his drawing-room, in a case that was the tabloid scandal of its day. Rattenbury’s head had been caved in by a croquet mallet, and Pakenham confessed to the murder. But in custody she recanted her testimony, instead pointing the finger at their 17 year old chaffeur George Stoner, whom she had taken as a teen lover. Claiming they were both addled on cocaine, Alma was acquitted. Painted in the press as the murdering seductress, Pakenham, just days later stabbed herself in the heart six times before throwing herself to her death in a river. Stoner was sent to prison for Rattenbury’s murder, and was released seven years later. Today, superstitious members of the staff say the hand of Francis Rattenbury can still be felt in the glorious hotel he built for Victoria. In the basement archive, staff often report seeing a dapper young gentleman walking the halls in an Edwardian suit smoking a cigar. They say it is the ghost of Rattenbury – seen much as he would have been that ill-fated night when he met the young seductress who would end his days. All ghost stories aside, the Empress, and its historic archive, manage to hide its sensational history quite well. Until June 1, 2017 the hotel will be undergoing renovations on Phase Two of its iconic restoration project. Work will be focused on the north wing, which includes the main lobby, health club, spa, and 229 guest rooms.",murder victorian places to stay hotels shops
200,The Gibraltar Point Lighthouse,"Toronto, Ontario",The oldest landmark of Toronto is a testament to shifting sands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-gibraltar-point-lighthouse-toronto-ontario,"While this lighthouse isn’t exactly on the shore anymore, it hasn’t moved since it was built. Thanks to the build up of sand since its construction around 1808 it’s now about 100 meters from the beach it watched over for 150 years. It’s located on what is now Centre Island, the largest of the small group of islands that were part of a peninsula for most of the 19th century. The light helped guide ships, boats and rafts as they approached the city of York, before it became Toronto. Construction started in 1803 and finished in 1807 or 1808 at 52 feet, and was taken a bit higher in 1832 to top off at 82 feet. While originally working off of whale oil, it was switched to coal oil in 1863 and moved to electric in 1916. As with any building over a certain age in North America, there is a rumour of a haunting at the lighthouse; the first keeper died under mysterious circumstances. J.P. Radan Muller took care of the light until 1815, when, on January 2nd, he passed on. Questions on how and why remain, though it is suggested beer was involved. It’s locked down now, but there are occasional events where it is opened up to the public. On misty evenings, there have been reports of ghostly moaning, which serves to attract curious ghost hunters. It’s currently the oldest landmark in Toronto, one of the oldest buildings (fourth, after three cabins) in Toronto and possibly the oldest lighthouse in the Great Lakes. The ferries to the islands are found at Queens Quay at the bottom of Bay St.",ghosts lighthouses

The Diefenbunker was built in the late 50s to protect the Canadian Government from nuclear attack and nicknamed after John Diefenbaker who was the Prime Minister at the time. It was part of a number of bunkers and locations to be used during a nuclear attack, and was officially known as the “Central Emergency Government Headquarters”. The Diefenbunker was in operation for 33 years as communications station CFS Carp before it was turned into a museum in 1998, and opened to the public. It is also a National Historic Site of Canada. In addition to being a museum, the Diefenbunker has also been used as a movie set in several movies including “Sum of All Fears”, “Zygote” and most recently “Fatman.” A highlight among the exhibitions is “Lost Nuke: The World’s First Broken Arrow” which is the story of the first ‘lost’ nuclear weapon, featuring artifacts from the site of the infamous plane crash. The original property stretched down to the Carp River. Two buildings, originally part of CFS Carp, that are still used today are the Mess Hall and maintenance building. Respectively they are now used as a municipal community hall and public library. The bases’ old baseball diamond is still visible, although now it is used as a cow paddock.",cold war tunnels subterranean sites military museums
202,United States–Canada Border Slash,United States / Canada,The entire length of the border is marked by a 20-foot-wide slash through the trees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uscanada-border-slash,"The United States–Canada border is the longest in the world. It stretches 5,525 miles from Maine to Alaska, traversing land, sea, and untouched wilderness. As such, you might assume this colossal border would be left untouched by humankind, merely an invisible line on a map. But you’d be wrong. Every year, the average American taxpayer pays half of a cent to the International Boundary Commission (IBC) for the sole purpose of deforesting every inch of the U.S.–Canada border. With an annual budget of $1,400,000, the IBC ensures that the boundary will never be just an imaginary line. Known as “the Slash,” this treeless zone is 20 feet wide and covers everything from narrow isolated islands to steep hillsides. Spanning national forests and towering mountains, the vast majority of the Slash is so remote that it will never receive any visitors (aside from a handful of bears), yet it is still painstakingly maintained every six years with grueling hours of exhausting manual labor. The Slash was initially deforested for the sole purpose of, according to the IBC, making sure that the “average person… knows they are on the border.” It all started in the 1800s, when the western land section of the U.S.–Canada border was set at the 49th parallel. The Slash was cut and over 8,000 original border markers were laid down, most of which are still standing along with it to this day. Unfortunately, there was no GPS system at the time, so the border markers were inadvertently placed in a zig-zag fashion, straying north or south of the official 49th parallel border by an average of 295 feet. The lack of sufficient cartography also led to irregular border cutoffs such as Point Roberts and the Northwest Angle. Despite its errors, witnessing the Slash is still on the bucket list of hundreds of geography nerds worldwide. Seeing the Slash can be as simple as going to Google Maps, zooming towards the U.S.–Canada border, and switching to satellite view. Those looking for a more up-close view can travel to Newport, Vermont, and hop aboard Northern Star Cruises, which will take you right alongside the Slash.  Another way to see the slash is in Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, on the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail to Canada, or the Long Trail in Vermont.",geographic oddities borders geographic markers trees plants

Ask any Montrealer and they’re bound to have a great-aunt, grandfather or uncle buried there. Founded in 1854, it is Canada’s largest graveyard and the third largest in North America. The cemetery’s architects were inspired by the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Their goal was to scale a French classicism style with the feelings of nature. This was a popular aesthetic movement at the time, influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a French philosopher. The cemetery was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1999. The generally Roman Catholic cemetery holds over a million people (that’s a third of the population of the city) and is complete with 65,000 monuments. One of the mausoleums, named La Pietà Mausoleum, has a life-sized reproduction of Michelangelo’s actual Pietà sculpture. Notre-Dame is as diverse as Montreal itself. The cemetery offers selected areas reserved for all types of nationalities. Take a roam around the cemetery and you’ll discover spots exclusively for Chinese, Korean, French, Italian, Greek, Polish, Portuguese and Ukrainian clients. Some of Quebec’s most famous deceased politicians and journalists call Notre-Dame their home, including Robert and Henri Bourassa, Thérèse Casgrain, Nick Auf der Maur and Maurice “Rocket” Richard. Located in the city’s eclectic Côte-des-Neiges neighbourhood and being only a few blocks away from the famous St. Joseph’s Oratory, Notre-Dame serves as an ideal place to wander, contemplating the afterlife, life, and everything in between.  45.50182, -73.606521",cemeteries

It’s probably not the home to a real Sasquatch—though we can never be sure—but it is a fun place to visit. The area where the caves are located has been a fertile location for sightings of a bipedal hirsute hominid known colloquially as Sasquatch or Bigfoot. There have purportedly been more than 200 reported sightings in British Columbia alone. So, whether in the caves or not, you might be lucky enough to spot something unusual during your trip. But maybe not. Scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of folklore, hoax, and misidentification, rather than a living animal, in part because of the large numbers thought necessary to maintain a breeding population. A few scientists, including the famous Jane Goodall, have expressed interest and possible belief in the creature. Bigfoot remains one of the more famous examples of a cryptid, and an enduring legend.  The caves are located on the private property of the Holiday Motel & RV Resort.

The Museum of Vancouver’s “Neon Vancouver|Ugly Vancouver” exhibit explores the controversial history of neon signage, which pitted technology against nature. The collection includes signs dating from the 1950s through the ’70s—a period during which there were more than 19,000 buzzing signs lighting the night sky of this Canadian city. “There was a real push in the 1960s and 70s to redefine Vancouver as a green, natural space,” said curator Joan Seidl in a release announcing the exhibition’s opening in 2011. “While we may love neon today, there was a real outcry against neon signs, which represented a more industrial, urban city.” A 1966 Vancouver Sun op-ed decried the signs as “outsized, outlandish, and outrageous,” and eventually, a law was adopted tightly regulating neon signs. An assortment of midcentury electric signage was donated to the Museum of Vancouver by a private collector in 1977, and the museum held on to the signs without displaying them for decades. It wasn’t until 1992 when the signs were rediscovered in the museum’s storage area that the idea for the exhibit was born. These days, the city has relaxed the regulations against neon, and the historic signs are displayed in recognition of their controversial place in the Vancouver’s history. Update May 2019: Note this exhibit is located at the Vancouver Museum.",neon cities industrial museums and collections art museums

Then in the 1960s the passage was abandoned, and it remained empty for about half a century. Now, it is enjoying use once again, this time as the highlight of a walking trail that leads to the waterfront in Brockville, Ontario. Opened in 1860, this railway tunnel is the oldest in Canada. It’s also one of only a few railway tunnels in the world with doors at each end. According to local lore, this was to keep out the cattle that used to roam the streets, but more likely it was meant to provide some winter protection and deter the townspeople from entering the tunnel. In any case, the doors now open to a popular walkway about a third of a mile long, illuminated in a rainbow of hues by thousands of colorful LED lights, and filled with the sounds of music. On hot days the tunnel becomes a cool retreat, as the temperature remains a near-constant 55 degrees Fahrenheit year-round. Technically inclined visitors may spot three different construction methods in this single tunnel, and because the tunnel was designed to allow water to penetrate (in order to reduce hydrostatic pressure against its walls), you may also notice mineral deposits forming at a much faster rate than those in natural caves.  Park for free at the tunnel's North Portal and walk south for the best experience. (The entrance is wheelchair accessible.) The tunnel is fully monitored, with panic buttons, automatic emergency lighting and ventilation, and wifi and cell phone service throughout. Wear decent walking shoes and have a poncho or hat handy.

Albert Yuen, a developer from Victoria, purchased the 160-acre parcel of land overlooking Sooke River in the 1980s, and construction on the resort began shortly after. The lodge was conceived as a retreat for those drawn to the lush landscape and quiet outdoor offerings of British Columbia’s temperate rainforests. Yuen and his wife envisioned a full-support infrastructure for their guests: over 200 luxury rooms, a pool and spa, and access to in-house shopping outlets. Timber Lodge, the centerpiece of the property, would play host to Canada’s largest log-burning fireplace. Guests would navigate the resort via winding stone staircases built into the canyon itself. But the Yuens’ vision could only carry them so far. A dearth of investment dollars eventually sunk their ambitions, and what had been built of the resort was left to crumble. In 2004 the property was acquired as parkland, and the partially constructed lodge buildings were stripped down to their stonework. Now, the ruins of the abandoned chateau have themselves become a draw for locals and curious tourists alike. Fencing and frequent patrols by park rangers keep trespassers away, but an ever-shifting canvas of graffiti murals inside the ruins proves that there are still those unable to resist the pull of Yuen’s lost dream.

McGillivray’s solid limestone. The tunnel leads into the mountain to two chambers roughly 80 feet by 25 feet. Many people say the Canadian Government tunneled into the mountain as a plan to build a bunker that would house officials in case of a nuclear event during the Cold War. As it turns out, those theorists are not too far from the truth. The shallow caves were actually constructed by three brothers, Stan, Joe, and Ted Rokosh. Their private company, Rocky Mountain Vaults and Archives, had the intent of holding only documents … in the beginning. Rocky Mountain Vaults and Archives obtained licenses to begin constructing the vault in 1969, though they had started tunneling before 1966. The company had planned to store the country’s “most important documents” to keep them safe in the event of nuclear fallout. The vault would be climate-controlled and protected from all elements and dangers. “Built for maximum protection… against any form of destructive vice, from mildew to hydrogen bomb.” The original plans for the facility called for a system of impenetrable chambers and vaults built right into the mountain, which could THEORETICALLY have served as a redoubt for government officials in the case of an apocalypse. The company was also in negotiations with the Royal Bank of Canada to house bank records in the vault, which would have made the venture successful. However, that arrangement failed when The Royal Bank decided to use a building in Montreal for its corporate records. So, what would undoubtedly have been the largest secure file storage vault of that time, never came to be. Without any committed clients, the company went bankrupt. The project was abandoned and left as it was, only a fraction of the planned size of the original ambitious idea. Today the vault caves are still empty and have become favorite spots for amateur hikers and cavers who can explore the unguarded chambers without hopping so much as a fence.  From the parking lot of the Heart Creek day use area take the path leading west. It's washed out a short way down the trail so make your way around it and carry on until you come to a marker post for the Trans Canada Trail.

209,Dude Chilling Park,"Vancouver, British Columbia",A renegade art installation in a small Vancouver park is now officially sanctioned by the City Parks Department.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dude-chilling-park,"Guelph Park has always been the centerpiece of community life in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Vancouver, British Columbia. As one of Vancouver’s most vibrant artistic neighborhoods since the 1950s, it was only logical that the park became the recipient of some slightly subversive stealth art. It all started in 1991, when a piece by sculptor Michael Dennis titled Reclining Figure was installed in the park. Reclining Figure struck some in the neighborhood as an impressionistic vision of just some guy kicking back. A “dude chilling,” you might say. For years the name gained traction, to the point where most locals referred to the small patch of green space as “Dude Chilling Park.” Without permission, in 2012 local artist Viktor Briestensky erected a lighthearted sign renaming the park. Briestensky’s sign was identical to the official Vancouver Parks Department signs, but instead featured the park’s beloved nickname. Unsurprisingly, the city took the sign down. After all, the park had an official name, one derived from the old family name of Queen Victoria no less. But while the city may have taken it down, the name lived on, and the removal of the joke sign did not go without public outcry. The people of Mount Pleasant had come to love the name, and a petition was signed by over 1,500 people in support of the sign’s return. It took a couple of years, but in 2014, the sign was re-erected in the park as an official public art piece. That reclining dude over there?  He looked pretty chill about it.

210,Pesuta Shipwreck,"Tlell, British Columbia",The stunning remnants of this wreck emerge from an otherworldly backdrop of rainforests.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pesuta-shipwreck,"The Haida Gwaii archipelago is a dreamy place tucked away in British Columbia’s North Coast. Here, in a land dotted with temperate rainforest, secluded villages, and an ancient air, a ship washed ashore on a remote beach a long time ago. Today, the Pesuta Shipwreck Trail leads hikers ten kilometers through the forest of Naikon Provincial Park to a remote stretch of beach near the Tlell River, where the 264-foot log barge ran aground during a winter storm in 1928. Like many vessels during the steam boom, the Pesuta began her life as a steam ship before being converted to a log barge in the early 1900s. During a particularly wicked tempest, the Pesuta finally came to rest along this long stretch of pebbly sand, known locally for a proliferation of agates. The ship’s bow remains intact, listing hard to port, after nearly a century of erosion from the punishing North Pacific’s wind and waves. The showing portion of the ship is mainly rotting timbers, but there are also still some metal portholes and such rusting away in their original spots on the ship. What has survived is a stunning wreck that ranks among the most approachable and explorable on Earth (despite a bit of a hike to get there), while contributing a sense of human scale to a landscape that can, at times, feel so ethereally removed from the rest of the world.",shipwrecks beaches forests ecosystems

The external design of The Mushroom House was inspired by the glacial rock formations found in Emerald Estates. As the home took shape, fascinated onlookers dubbed it The Hobbit House, Bedrock, and finally, The Mushroom House. This unique house was completed in 2002 and features mosaic floors, an amazing stonework fireplace, stained glass windows, and unobstructed views of Wedge and Armchair Mountains.",drugs eccentric homes houses homes geology architectural oddities architecture

Since the mid-1970s besides being a teacher, he has also been building a massive, and rather frightening, castle. Inspired by druids and ancient Briton, Camani has filled the castle and its grounds with fire-breathing dragons, arches shaped like gaping mouths, and an eerie forest of tree-shaped sculptures. The castle even has a dungeon. The most distinctive feature of the Midlothian Castle, however, are the hundreds of screaming concrete heads that he has placed throughout the grounds, including a giant one on top of a castle tower. In the words of the artist, “Amidst the heads and disks, the solitude of the park envelopes the visitor in a peculiar silence, a silence both quieting and disquieting, penetrated only by the eerie scream of the peacock.” Hwy 11 North from Toronto, take exit for Burk's Falls (Ontario St), follow Ontario St north through town then take a sharp hairpin left turn onto Hwy 520 to Ryerson, follow Hwy 520 west then turn left onto Midlothian Road and continue west. This site is not marked but is hard to miss the 20 foot high screaming heads. Feel free to wander the grounds the artist doesn't mind, but do not enter the house unless invited and remember as the sign says on the gate, you enter Midlothian Castle at Your Own Risk.

213,Hidden Beach,"Islas Marietas, Mexico","A lovers' beach, tucked below the surface of the island, provides a safe haven for romance.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hidden-beach-playa-del-almor,"A gaping hole in the surface of the lush green island opens onto a secret beach, with ample shade, sun, and crystal-clear water. Playa del Amor, commonly known as the Hidden Beach, is a feature of one of the Marieta Islands, located some 22 nautical miles west of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, at the mouth of Banderas Bay. It looks like something out of a fantasy novel: a wide, sandy cavern with the blue waters of the Pacific rushing in. The Marieta Islands is a group of uninhabited islands formed by underwater volcano eruptions. They are natural wonders, but it was something other than the volcanic activity that brought the burrowed beach to light. It is rumored that the hole that created the Hidden Beach was a result of deliberate bombings. The Marieta Islands have always been completely uninhabited, making them ideal sites for military testing by the Mexican government. Beginning in the early 1900s, weapons and artillery were tested on the Marieta Islands, a safe distance from Mexican citizens but not so safe for Marieta topography. Test bombs are the known cause for many caves and rock formations on the island, possibly including the Hidden Beach. In the 1960s, scientist Jacques Cousteau led a protest against harmful human activity on the islands. In 2005, the islands were finally named a national park, Parque Nacional Islas Marietas, making swimming, kayaking, sunbathing, and other forms of recreation the only activity, and prohibiting hunting and fishing around the islands. Also, later on, the park was designated as a UNESCO MAB Biosphere Reserve. Extensive military testing damaged flora and fauna on the island for decades, but many years of peace have replenished the islands’ pristine waters and marine life. The Hidden Beach is invisible from the outside and is only accessible through a long water tunnel that links the beach to the Pacific Ocean. There is approximately six feet of space above water level, so visitors can arrive at the beach by swimming or kayaking. The islands remain uninhabited but are frequently visited by tourists who come to enjoy the diverse marine wildlife and the unique tropical Eden of Playa del Amor.  The islands are an hour long boat ride northwest from the coast of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. There are ample tour companies that provide day excursions to the Hidden Beach. Wristbands to the ""hidden beach"" are limited and must be reserved a few days in advance. Several tour companies can provide the trip for about 1500 pesos each. Tours can also be made without the hidden beach which are still fun for about 500 pesos each.",secret national parks beaches oceans hidden natural wonders water nature
214,La Isla de las Muñecas (Island of the Dolls),"Mexico City, Mexico","An island filled with hundreds of hanging, decomposing, decapitated dolls.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-isla-de-las-munecas,"There is a disturbing circular nature to the story of “La Isla de la Muñecas,” or the Island of the Dolls. Over fifty years ago, Don Julian Santana left his wife and child and moved onto an island on Teshuilo Lake in the Xochimilco canals. According to some, a young girl actually drowned in the lake, while most others, including his relatives, say Don Julian Santana merely imagined the drowned girl. Regardless, Don Julian Santana devoted his life to honoring this lost soul in a unique, fascinating, and—for some—unnerving way: he collected and hung up dolls by the hundreds. Eventually, Don Julian transformed the entire island into a kind of bizarre, (for some) horrifying, doll-infested wonderland. Don Julian Santana began collecting lost dolls from the canals and the trash near his island home. He is also said to have traded produce he grew to locals for more dolls. Santana did not clean up the dolls or attempt to fix them, but rather put them up with missing eyes and limbs, covered in dirt, and generally in whatever ramshackle state he found them in. Even when dolls arrived in good shape, the wind and weather turned them into cracked and distorted versions of themselves. Don Julian also kept his cabin filled with the dolls, which he dressed in headdresses, sunglasses, and other accoutrement. Despite the fact that most people found the isle frightening, Don Julian saw the dolls as beautiful protectors, and he welcomed visitors, whom he would show around, charging a small fee for taking photos. In 2001 Don Julian Santana was found drowned in the same area in which he believed the little girl had died.  Located in the Xochimilco borough 17 miles south of the center of Mexico City. Best way to get there is to leave from Embarcadero Cuemanco. It's four hours round trip and cost $1,400 MEX or roughly $75 US dollars. Keep an eye out for some of the wildlife during your boat trip. Commonly seen creatures include pelicans, king fishers, egrets, and several species of water snakes.",dolls outsider art islands collections

Located among the lush natural ravines of Naucalpan, Mexico, Quetzalcoatl’s Nest is a fantastical snake-shaped structure that includes ten separate apartments spread over 16,500 square feet. Designed by renowned Mexican architect Javier Senosiain, the residence is an exploration of ‘organic architecture’ that takes its design inspiration from nature and aims for minimal impact to the environment. Working on the irregular-shaped land, which is filled with caves and vast tracts of oak trees, proved challenging but inspirational for Senosiain, who looked at the natural shape of a cave mouth and saw an animal aspect. With this in mind, the architect built a magnificent 165 x 20 foot serpent’s head, the gaping maw of which is shaped from the site’s biggest cave. Despite the obvious addition of a massive snake house, the foliage and natural surroundings remain almost untouched by the complex. The only alterations made were considered necessary for safety and construction allowing Senosiain to stay true to his organic architecture ethic. The twisting walkways of Quetzalcoatl’s Nest provide some pretty spectacular views of the ravines and canyons so long as you don’t mind standing in the jaws of an Aztec snake god. Update: As of July 2019, this location can be accessed through overnight rental stays.

But beyond the sky-colored concrete lies a world that once brought two of Mexico’s most famous artists into contact with Marxist revolutionary Leon Trotsky. Before Trotsky ever made his way to Mexico City, La Casa Azul was already a hotbed of intellectual activity, and was the childhood home of Frida Kahlo. It was in La Casa Azul - bedridden after a bus accident that left her in pain for the rest of her life - that she learned to paint,. After her painting began to take off, La Casa Azul really began to take shape. After marrying Diego Rivera, Kahlo and her husband became friends with Trotsky, who had begun a life of exile in Mexico. During his time in Mexico, Trotsky spent two years with his wife at La Casa Azul and even allegedly had an affair with Kahlo when her relationship with Rivera was on the rocks. Kahlo also died in the home and in 1958, her husband donated it to be turned into a museum dedicated to her life and works, the museum offers visitors an intimate look within the walls, some of which were actually modified by Rivera who studded them with volcanic rock and ceramics. Along with their artistic additions to the house and a pre-Columbian courtyard pyramid replete with some Aztec and Toltec artifacts, the museum also features a look at the husband and wife’s history, and showcases a famous inscription left behind by the tempestuous couple. It reads simply “Frida and Diego lived in this house – 1929-1954”   You can catch a car service to this location or even take the metro and walk to the destination from the central district.

A healthy serving of eye candy in the form of wooden floors, balconies with curvy green handrails, and living plants that seem to protrude from the shelves are common to the seven locations spanning the entire city. These stores will stir up your imagination, or at least give you something to look at as you stir your coffee. Common items for sale include new titles or reprints of older books in both Spanish and English and music (CD and vinyl) sealed in plastic wrap. Designer items commonly with Mexican and literary themes—porcelain luchador-themed salt and pepper shakers, or plush toys of William Shakespeare for example—are abundant on the stores’ gift sections. Don’t expect to find old, rare books or to have to dig through dusty crates of trash and treasure in these chic establishments. Two of the locations are small, single-story cafebrerías in the shopping malls of Santa Fe and Perisur. The locations on neighboring Roma and Condesa neighborhoods both feature 2-story floorplans in former mansions built in the traditional art deco style. In the Central Zona Rosa location on Hamburgo street, the dining gets less formal over each floor—table dining on the ground floor, sofas and reading for the cafe on the first floor, and a bar on the second floor. Most of the pictures above are from the featured Polanco location on Alejandro Dumas street. The mid-south San Angel location in the Centro Cultural Helénico theatre also features fascinating architectural features over its wooden-paneled 3 floors, including a very tall palm tree that grows through the entire height of the building.  Every store has different opening times but the constant in which all will be open is between 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Changes to the restaurant/café menus usually occur throughout all locations but still tend to offer at least a few vegan and vegetarian options.",shops

Instead of accessing the Underworld through a dirty backdoor in a cantina, pre-colonial Mayan tradition believed the gates to the beyond lay in cenotes. Just a few kilometers from Valladolid in the Yucatan Peninsula, the landscape is dotted with natural sinkholes, leading straight down into the earth. Unlike their unsightly name, the sinkholes are beautiful and filled with crystal clear, blue-green water. They are easily accessible and have become a tourist hot spot due to their proximity to spring break destinations like Cancun. Despite their obvious aesthetic attraction, the Cenotes in the region have a fascinating history, dating back to the Mayans who inhabited the Yucatan before colonialism. Since the Mayans believed the holes led to the afterlife, they would often drop important objects into the cenotes. Some legends also state they were used in human sacrifice, an oft-debated part of Mayan history. Since most cenotes in the region were explored and studied by archeologists in the early 20th century, you are unlikely to be swimming with the remains of a Mayan sacrifice.

Situated among lush gardens and covering an area of over 38,000 square meters, this temple of knowledge is generally referred to as a “megalibrary” both for its size and the undeniable sense of import conveyed by the structure itself. Transparent walls, stories of intentionally slightly mismatched floors, and intricate networks of balconies and paths between replicating stacks let visitors literally get lost in the worlds contained within the books themselves. This library resembles something from a short story by the Argentinian magical realist author Jorge Luis Borges. It seems like it would be easy to lose yourself in the Biblioteca Vasconcelos.

Towering over a plaza in Northern Mexico City, the Soumaya Museum covers 170,000 square feet and glides elegantly six stories into the skyline. Opened in 2011, the shiny ethereal building cost $70 million to build, but resulted in a chic complex of galleries accessible through a narrow entrance in the building’s front. Quite fittingly, considering the magical appearance of the museum, it was Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Colombian novelist, author of One Hundred Years of Solitude, and founder of the magical realist literary movement,  who cut the ribbon during the opening ceremony. Although the museum was a donation from Carlos Slim, each part of its construction was an inside job. His son in law, Fernando Romero, designed the massive structure and the exterior is covered in 16,000 hexagonal aluminum tiles from an aluminum plant Carlos Slim owns. The entire structure coyly enriches Mexico City’s cultural landscape while padding the pockets of the museum’s benefactor. While the modern architecture of the Soumaya Museum has drawn praise for its ingenuity and partnership with Frank Gehry, many have also derided the building as an eyesore. One critic even went as far as to attack Carlos Slim, saying that money can buy everything, except taste. Worth an estimated $65 billion, it’s at least nice to see Carlos Slim give a little back to his country. A museum is certainly a better way to spend your billions than writing your name in the sand of your private island.  Admission is always free.

222,Las Pozas,"Xilitla, Mexico",Extraordinary sculpture garden created by an eccentric English poet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/las-pozas,"Located in Xilitla, a small town of about 10,000 people in the Huasteca region of southern San Luis Potosi state, Las Pozas is the creation of Edward James, an eccentric English poet and artist and patron of the Surrealist movement. Its origins date back to 1947 when James, living in semi-exile in Mexico at the time, acquired the coffee plantation near Xilitla. He began his life in the sheltered luxury of the English upper class, attending Eton and Oxford, and later becoming a great supporter and collector of Surrealist art, sponsoring both Dali and Magritte in the 1930s. His English home — Monkton House — is also a dedicated surrealist fantasy. His role as a patron of the arts put him in touch with luminaries of his time, including Dylan Thomas, Sigmund Freud, D. H. Lawrence, and Aldous Huxley. Huxley introduced James to Hollywood types, who in turn introduced him to spiritualist West Coast visionaries, who then introduced him to the wilds of Mexico. A great lover of plants and animals, he was immediately attracted to its jungles with their lush vegetation. James registered his new property in Mexico in the name of his friend and guide Plutarco Gastelum, who would later become the foreman and overseer of all construction that took place there. For the next ten years, James used Las Pozas as a home for orchids and exotic animals. After an unprecedented frost in 1962 destroyed many of his plants, James started building the extraordinary sculpture garden that sits on the site today. The design of Las Pozas was inspired both by James’ orchids and the vegetation of the Huastecan jungle, combined with architectural elements taken from the Surrealist movement he was so closely involved with. Construction on Las Pozas began in 1962, and carried on for the next 20 plus years until James’ death in 1984. Las Pozas means “the pools” in Spanish, named for the nine pools on the property created from waters that flow naturally through it. The gardens feature more than 30 structures, ranging from plant sculptures to winding staircases to nowhere, and cathedral-inspired screens — some ornately finished, others seemingly incomplete, although it is unclear if they were ever intended to be “finished.” Most of the construction was done by Plutaco Gastelum, James’ friend and co-designer, who was described in Smithsonian magazine as “part Yaqui Indian, part Spanish aristocrat and a swashbuckling former rancher, boxer, telegrapher and amateur architect.” Gastelum’s home is now the eclectic hotel known as Posada El Castillo, near Las Pozas. In the 1960s and 1970s, James dedicated more and more of his resources to his “Surrealist Xanadu,” as he referred to it, spending millions of dollars and employing hundreds of masons, artisans, and local craftsmen. By the times James died in 1984, he had built 36 Surrealist-inspired concrete sculptures spread out over more than 20 acres of a tropical jungle. Over time, Las Pozas became known to artists, writers, travelers, and photographers interested in James and Surrealism. After James died, the Gastelum family took over the running of Las Pozas.

The twin houses were designed by the famed painter and architect Juan O’Gorman, a friend of Rivera, and constructed in 1932. They combine a bold functionalist style with more traditional Mexican forms and touches, including the colors and rows of cacti (O’Gorman is considered the father of Mexican functionalism). The left house belonged to Diego. In his studio, it’s possible to see the painter’s “judas” collection, a collection of papier-mâché cartonería figures of humans, skeletons, and animals, all assembled in the studio where he first constructed them.

224,Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chich'en Itza,"Chichen Itza, Mexico",Every equinox this Maya pyramid puts on a spooky ancient light show.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-kukulcan-chichen-itza,"A two-and-a-half hour bus ride from Cancun takes you away from the thumping parties of spring break and into the once thriving ancient capital of the Yucatán Maya, Chich’en Itza. During the spring and autumn equinoxes, thousands of tourists and locals pack in around the pyramid to recreate the parties of a thousand years ago—sans the cutting out of hearts—and to watch the “descent of Kukulcan.” A carnival atmosphere fills the surrounding meadow with sounds of drums, traditional music, and cheering crowds. According to legend, twice a year when the day and night are in balance, this pyramid dedicated to Kukulcan (or Quetzalcoatl), the feathered serpent god, is visited by its namesake. On the equinox, Kukulcan returns to earth to commune with his worshipers, provide blessing for a full harvest and good health before entering the sacred water, bathing in it, and continuing through it on his way to the underworld. A handclap near the base of the pyramidal results in an unusual chirping echo, which is said to replicate the call of the sacred quetzal bird. All legends aside, crafty and mathematically brilliant architecture combined with the natural rotation of the Earth creates an amazing and somewhat eerie image of a giant snake crawling down the temple. For five hours an illusion of light and shadow creates seven triangles on the side of the staircase starting at the top and inching its way down until it connects the top platform with the giant stone head of the feathered serpent at the bottom. For 45 minutes this impressive shadow stays in its entirety before slowing descending the pyramid and disappearing along with the crowd that gathered to see it. The Pyramid of Kukulcan or Kukulkan (also known as El Castillo, a name given by the Spanish Conquistadors) is the centre of Chich’en Itza, it was built over a preexisting temple between 800 and 900 CE. It is the biggest pyramid in Chich’en Itza; at its base 53.3 meters wide on all four sides. It towers above the other monuments at 24 meters tall with a 6-meter temple on top of the highest platform. Before access to the throne room of the pyramid was restricted, you could climb to the top and, on a clear day, see the top of the grand pyramid at the nearby ruin site of Ek Balam. The Mesoamerican fascination with, and knowledge of, math and astronomy shines when examining the details of its architecture. Each of the four sides has 91 steps ascending it, 364 steps total, with the temple topping the pyramid considered an addition step totalling 365, each step representing a day in the calendar. Additionally, the pyramid’s nine stages, bisected by a staircase on each side, represent the eighteen months of the Maya Calendar year. The pyramid was built to be a physical representation of the Maya Calendar (the same calendar that predicts the end of the world in 2012), while its orientation, slightly North East, is believed to have been calculated in order to create the phenomenon know as the “Descent of Kukulcan”. This phenomenon is recreated nightly (artificially) during the Light and Sounds Show at 7 p.m. in winter and 8 p.m. in summer. Chich’en Itza is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The archaeological site features various structures that are grouped into major clusters. The most famous and visited cluster is the Great North Platform where besides the Kukulcan Pyramid one can find the Temple of the Jaguars and the Great Ball Court.

One of the most ethereal qualities of Ik-Kil is the light filtering in from above, illuminating the mini waterfalls, vegetation, and vines that wrap their way around the edges of the cenote and hang directly from overhead like a curtain. The sinkhole clocks in at a depth of over 130 feet, and archaeologists are said to have found bones and jewelry in the watery depths of what was once a sacred Mayan sacrificial site. Visitors to this magical place descend down 85 feet of winding stone steps. From there it’s either a short jump into the water, or a considerably taller dive off a platform if you feel like joining the daredevils in line.

La Santa Muerte is probably the most popular idol in Mexico after Santa Maria de Guadalupe, an attention condemned by the Vatican, who sees the reverence for the skeleton saint as blasphemous. Suspiciously seen for sometimes being associated with drug trades and criminality, the Santa Muerte is the idol of the destitute, the one who lost hope and is outcast by the Catholic Church. The church itself contains a large statue of La Santa Muerte alongside the main altar. In 2007, David Romo, the Bishop of the Chapel, replaced it on the actual altar with a dressed mannequin, the Angel de La Santa Muerte, to avoid a too-macabre association with criminal acts.

227,Desierto de los Leones (Desert of the Lions),"Mexico City, Mexico",Explore the atmospheric ruins of an abandoned convent in the dense forests of Mexico's first national park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/desert-of-the-lions-national-park-convent,"Contrary to what the name suggests, Desierto de los Leones, or Desert of the Lions, is neither a desert nor are there any lions. Rather, it is the name of both Mexico’s first national park and the abandoned convent that lies within its forests. The origin of the name instead reputedly comes from the forest’s remote location outside Mexico City, and because the Spanish settlers were surprised at the number of Puma they encountered in the area, which they called lions. Today, however, things have changed. The Puma has become extinct in the forests, and urban sprawl creeps ever closer. These woods were never settled by the Aztecs, who preferred to occupy the lakesides (though there is evidence that they and other earlier civilizations long used the area to hunt deer and other game animals.) It wasn’t until the arrival of the Spanish that people began to live in the area in any numbers. In 1606, the Catholic Carmelite order of barefoot monks chose to build their convent here due to its peaceful surroundings and distance from the city, which made it ideal for meditation and retreat. Life for the monks who occupied the building would have been simple but often harsh due to the vow of poverty, silence, and chastity they had taken. In addition to the vow of silence that prohibited the monks from communicating with each other, they also were required to walk barefoot, which must have been very unpleasant considering the terrain, dangers of rattlesnakes and scorpions, and often cold temperatures. The convent eventually was abandoned in 1810, partly due to the deterioration and collapse of the building as a result of the near-constant humidity from, as well as the war of independence against Spain reaching the outskirts of the forest. After being used as a military barracks, the area was declared a forest reserve in 1876 and became Mexico’s first national park. However, many contend that the monks never really went away, and the convent ruins are surrounded by urban legends about the supernatural. Over the years, many visitors have reported seeing the ghosts of barefooted and hooded monks and feeling the presence of a sinister and unseen entity watching them. Though the Puma are gone, plenty of wildlife is still found within the park,  such as coyotes, bobcats, white-tailed deer, raccoons, and foxes. These, however, are seldom to be seen by visitors and it is more likely that you will see reptiles and amphibians such as rattlesnakes, salamanders, and birds of prey like the red-tailed hawk, horned owl, and Harris hawk.  Getting to Desierto de los Leones is slightly difficult. The best and fastest option is to take a registered taxi or uber from San Angel, which will drop you off at the entrance. Make sure you talk to the driver and schedule to be picked up when you are finished at the park. Bring some warm clothes as it is almost always cold, misty, and humid due to the forest's microclimate. If you are hungry there are several very good and cheap places to eat and have a coffee at the entrance just outside of the convent. Be mindful of stepping on rattlesnakes while walking in the forest during the summer months, and do not risk eating any of the fungi found on the trails, many of which look like ""magic mushrooms"" but are actually toxic.",extinct animals wildlife sanctuaries catholic monasteries national parks forests ecosystems abandoned ruins

The building that used to house the monastery school now contains a collection of Colonial religious art. In the crypt below the school you can find 12 mummified bodies of former parishioners. The bodies were left in the crypt after the school secularized and was finally abandoned in 1861. Due to soil conditions the bodies dehydrated and naturally mummified. The mummies were discovered by members of the Liberation Army of the South looking for monastic treasures during the Revolution. The soldiers left the mummies in place, but left the crypt uncovered. Over the following years, the bodies were rediscovered by people secretly exploring the decrepit building and became famous among the locals. In 1929 the mummies were placed in their velvet-lined wood and glass caskets that are still in use today. In 2012, the crypt was fully restored and opened to the public.

229,La Posada del Sol,"Mexico City, Mexico","Meant to be one of the most extravagant hotels in the world, now an eerie, abandoned architectural gem in Mexico City.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-posada-del-sol,"In the center of Mexico City lie the ruins of the Hotel Posada Del Sol, a graffiti-strewn abandoned hotel that is truly one of the most haunting sites in North America’s largest city. The deteriorating edifice was the magnum opus of Fernando Saldaña Galván, who poured his blood, sweat, and tears into the hotel in the mid-20th century in a failed attempt to create a unique artistic center in Mexico City that would stand as one of the most extravagant hotels in the world. Although Posada Del Sol is visibly crumbling from the outside and has little meaning to the streetside vendors who surround it, the inside reveals the true beauty and historical significance of the hotel. Combining baroque colonial architecture and modernist decadence, Posada Del Sol occupies more than half a block, encompassing gardens, patios, fountains, terraces, massive paintings, and elevated viewpoints. More than 600 rooms were built by Galván, who adorned the property with a casino, a theater, a gorgeous chapel, ballrooms, galleries, tea rooms, turkish baths, and a human-sized chess board. Unfortunately for Galván, external factors got the better of him. Construction on Posada Del Sol was completely suspended at the beginning of 1945, and as Galván’s debt rose, he hung himself in the hotel yard. Legend has it he cursed the building before taking his life, which is why it stands empty today. One explanation cited for the hotel’s demise is that Galván went insane and murdered his family just before opening the cultural center; others believe that Galván got into deep water with the Freemasons, or that the project was all a façade to perform satanic rites. Indeed, one of the most eerie features of the abandoned masterpiece is a dark room believed to be home to the altar of a missing girl who was found dead in the hotel’s basement and whose ghost is believed to haunt the place. Some have been known to place candy on the girl’s altar in order to escape her curse. It is illegal to visit the inside of the hotel, so it is recommended that you enjoy Posada Del Sol from the outside. It is quite hard to get in beyond the wired net and metal fences and it is located in front of a main road and government buildings.

230,Minichelista Restaurant,"Mexico City, Mexico",A quirky and charming restaurant founded by artists.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/minichelista-restaurant,"Minichelista in Mexico City is likely the most bizarre restaurant you will ever visit, and even one of the best. Created 10 years ago by artists, the space is full of little tiny nooks and crannies where you can eat at a table made from the handlebars of a motorcycle as you sit in a closet with your date. The restaurant is a large house, and as you walk around the residence and up spiral staircases it feels like the place is your own as food is being cooked all around the house. The staff are super casual, drinking coffee from cups as they wait your table and smoking cigarettes while greeting you at the front door. Everything is well thought-out at this amazing establishment. Even the french fries that come with your meal will arrive on the plate as a collection of a few thin fries, a few wedges, a couple of happy faces, and some rippled fries: Someone actually takes the time to mix up the fries for the plates. The milkshakes will melt your mind once they hit your tongue. A hot chocolate comes with cayenne to make sure it warms everything up. The quirkiness of this place is surely worth mentioning to anyone visiting the city.  Take Line 2 of the metro to Popotla Metro Station. It is a 20 minute walk from the station or get off in Normal Metro Station and you can catch a bus (tell driver you are going to Parque Revolucion) and it's a minute walk from there.

231,Skull Rack of the Great Temple,"Mexico City, Mexico",A disquieting Aztec sculpture displays hundreds of stone skulls representing the victims of human sacrifice.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skull-rack-of-the-great-temple,"At the ruins of the Great Temple (Templo Mayor) in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan you will find a humble stone wall that on first glance, from a distance, may appear to be just another part of the ancient site. If you take a few steps closer and scrutinize the structure, you will be greeted by hundreds of grinning skulls. You are now standing face-to-face with the skull rack, or tzompantli as it was known to the Aztecs, of the Great Temple. The tzompantli served three simple yet terrifying social purposes in several Mesoamerican civilizations: to publicly display the skulls of sacrificial victims, to honor the gods to whom the victims were sacrificed, and to showcase the military might and power of the emperor and empire. Two types of skull racks were used at Aztec religious sites. One was made purely from stone featuring symbolically carved skulls, like the one at the Great Temple. The other was typically much larger and made of wood, which displayed real human skulls to drive the point home. The wooden tzompantli with human skulls were enormous and imposing, notoriously shocking the Spanish conquistadors when they first encountered the Aztec people. One skull wall is estimated to have been nearly 200 feet long and 100 feet wide at its peak. It would have been able to display tens of thousands of skulls, giving a chilling look at the sacrificial rituals of the ancient civilization.  You can find the skull rack at the ruins of the Great Temple. It is not necessary to pay to see it as it can be seen from the railings surrounding the archeological site. There is also an example of an ancient tzompantli inside the Great Temple museum (Museo de Sitio del Templo Mayor).",rituals aztec skulls temples ancient religion archaeology sacred spaces ruins
232,Museo del Juguete Antiguo México,"Mexico City, Mexico",Visiting this cacophonous collection of vintage novelties is like stepping into the mind of a crazed toymaker.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-del-juguete-antiguo-mexico,"Opened in 2006 and showing off over 20,000 playthings from the early 20th century, Mexico’s Museo del Juguete Antiguo México (Old Toy Museum of Mexico) gives curious visitors an alternate history of the country’s culture, told exclusively through its toys. Spanning four floors, the extensive toy collection of architect Roberto Shimizu Kinoshita (who started collecting at age 10) fills a bursting building in Colonia Doctores in Mexico City. The collection runs from the 19th century to the 1980s, with a particular emphasis on toys popular in Mexico, but there is plenty here that non-Mexican toy fans can appreciate. Anyone looking for a typical museum with ordered cases and rows of labeled objects may be in for a shock at Kinoshita’s collection. His is more of an explosive celebration of toys and childhood than a scholarly exercise in trinket history. Every last inch of the space is packed with toys, often in whimsical display cases built either by the founder himself or local craftsman. A lot of the cases are made from salvaged items, like large industrial light fixtures. There’s occasionally a theme to various corners, but for the most part it’s simply floor after floor of delightful chaos. One of the highlights is a giant, two-story-tall head (of questionable racial appropriateness) with two maracas, rescued from a defunct nightclub, that fills the inner atrium. The first floor houses a gift shop that is only somewhat more organized than the museum. They sell vintage toys to support the museum, also giving visitors an opportunity to start a collection of their own. A recent addition to the museum is the creation of a street art “speakeasy” on the rooftop. It is called a speakeasy due to the fact that it is not open unless a special request is made at the front desk for access. It not only affords visitors an opportunity to view some paintings by a mix of very talented Mexican and international artists, but includes a bonus rooftop view of the surrounding neighborhood. A little out of the way, but not difficult to find. Look for the building with the huge mural on the side. There's an affiliated toy store on the first floor, with a separate door upstairs for the museum.",toy museums toys museums and collections museums
233,The Great Pyramid of Cholula,"San Andrés Cholula, Mexico","An Aztec temple, the largest man-made pyramid in the world, sits buried in earth with a Spanish church set on top.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-great-pyramid-of-cholula-san-andres-cholula-mexico,"Thanks to the brush and grasses that had overgrown its walls, the largest man-made pyramid in the world has been mistaken for a hill. Even today, it’s understandable how this came to pass, thanks to the old Spanish chapel perched at its summit. Originally constructed over 2000 years ago, the Great Pyramid of Tepanapa (often referred to as the Great Pyramid of Cholula) boasts a larger volume than any other ancient, man-made structure including the Egyptian pyramids. Stylistically, the pyramid is an oddity, puzzling archeologists to this day by incorporating architectural elements of both the Teotihuacan and El Tajin civilizations. During the many pre-Columbian power shifts in Mexico, the pyramid itself fell out of use in favor of other structures, such as one of the many sacrificial altars on the ten-acre site. It is unclear whether it was through disuse that the pyramid became overgrown with shrubbery, or if, when the Aztecs caught wind of the impending Spanish arrival, the Cholulans literally buried the pyramid in a last-ditch, communal effort to preserve the massive temple, an important piece of their culture. Either way, when the Spanish arrived at Cholula in 1519, Cortes and his men were so occupied with the decimation of the indigenous people and their more conspicuous holy sites that they failed to recognize the pyramid as such, instead thinking it the perfect hill site for one of their countless new churches! Within the year, La Iglesia de los Remedios was constructed, where it remains to this day. As the dirt began to fall away, the pyramid revealed itself to archeologists, who have excavated the pyramid’s stairways, platforms, altars, and over five miles of tunnels snaking through the structure’s innards. The site and its network of tunnels are open to visitors for guided and unguided visits, though it is advised to confine exploration of the tunnels to daylight hours.",long now locations cultures and civilizations subterranean sites sacred spaces ruins

El Caracol, which translates to “spiral-shaped,” or, more literally, “snail,” is named after the winding staircase that rounds the interior of the central tower. The stacked levels of the building resemble a stone wedding cake with staggered staircases leading to the central tower whose collapsed dome is somewhat similar to the design of modern observatories. El Caracol’s crumbling viewing tower rises above the lush jungle, so ancient astronomers could have viewed the stars in 360 degrees, tracking solstices, equinoxes, and eclipses. Most delighting is the alignment of the remaining viewing windows, which seem to be designed specifically to track the appearance and disappearance of Venus in the night sky. In addition to assigning the second planet some religious significance, the Mayans were able to track the movements of Venus and thus measure longer intervals of the Earth’s orbit. Within eyeshot of the pyramid El Castillo, El Caracol is easy to visit and is considered a major Mexican tourist attraction.",ancient technology telescopes observatories retro-tech astronomy instruments of science ruins
235,Palacio Postal,"Mexico City, Mexico","Gilded heaven for philatelists and architecture freaks, still in full working order despite sitting atop tremulous ground.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-postal,"The architecture of this jaw-dropping, century-old post office nestled in the center of Mexico City’s bustling historic central district would be glorious enough on its own; Palacio Postal’s true magnificence, however, hails from the fact that its splendor is completely de rigueur for the masses who continue using it for purely pragmatic reasons daily, numbed to the unparalleled blend of golden architecture on all sides. Dreamt up by then-President Porfirio Díaz, the Central Historic District’s secret treasure was brought to life by Mexican engineer Gonzalo Garita y Frontera, designed in conjunction with renowned Italian architect Adamo Boari, the latter of whom would go on to earn international recognition for his work on the adjacent Palacio de Bellas Artes. Palacio Postal – interchangeably referred to as Correo Mayor, or the Main Post Office – had its first stone placed on September 14th, 1902, though the building ultimately took five years to complete. Despite regular earthquakes (including a major one in 1985 which caused damage requiring no small amount of restoration to the historic building), Palacio Postal has been in continuous operation since its opening day in 1907. Designed to include an exterior façade of yellow quarry stone and ornamental columns that are decorative but not extraordinary, no one would expect the blinding, latticed gold-work waiting just inside its doors. The structure’s unique style hasn’t lent itself to easy classification over the past century; rather, it’s become a sort of architectural mood ring, with assessments revealing more about the viewer’s perspective than what is necessarily most prominent in the building itself. Terms and descriptors for the Palacio most frequently tossed about include: Art Nouveau, Moorish, Venetian Gothic Revival, Baroque, Neoclassical, Spanish Renaissance Revival, and more. What remains undeniable are the blinding amounts of gold everywhere, its domed ceiling of leaded glass, tiled marble floors, and staircases that deliver patrons to their destinations with a grace that has been all but lost to the ages. Though investing such effort to build a literal palace in place of a simple post office may seem remiss in our modern era, at the time, Palacio Postal served as the flagship of Mexico’s brand new national postal system. Never before had the country been united in a single agency – let alone in a service provided by the government – with a way for its citizens to reliably communicate from one disparate end of the nation to the other. In addition to continuing to provide all the basic, expected functions of a post office on its first floor, Palacio Postal also houses a small museum dedicated to displaying the history of Mexico’s mail service. Its crown jewel is the invaluable, very first stamp Mexico ever issued, which true philatelists find among the most titillating postal relics on display anywhere in the world today.

236,Pyramids of Tlatelolco,"Mexico City, Mexico",These haunting ruins of a 700-year-old Prehispanic city have witnessed centuries of wars and massacres.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramids-of-tlatelolco,"In the Plaza de las Tres Culturas with its disorientating juxtaposition of modern, colonial, and ancient architecture sprawl the hallowed stone ruins of a Prehispanic city replete with pyramids. Today, you may visit the mysterious ruins of Tlatelolco and wander the ancient pathways in the shadows of the pyramids. Early in the history of the Aztec colonization of the Valley of Mexico, there was a dissident group that had separated from the main party of nomads to found a settlement elsewhere. This group called themselves the Tlatelolca and set about building the city that later would become Tlatelolco approximately 700 years ago. The site remained as a semi independent settlement that held a degree of autonomy from the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan for many years. The Tlatelolca traded heavily with the Aztecs and provided an important source of resources for the growing power. This peaceful coexistence continued until the Tlatelolca, in response to threats, declared their outright independence. This angered the Aztec emperor Axayacatl, who promptly sent out battalions of his eagle and jaguar warriors to force the city into submission. The Tlatelolca people were then promptly crushed in a brutal military campaign, which brought the population under the complete control of the Aztec empire for the rest of its history and the city was quickly incorporated as part of the capital Tenochtitlan. That wasn’t the only turmoil the city would face. In 1521, the Spanish conquest sent shockwaves through Tlatelolco with the arrival of Hernán Cortés and his conquistadors in the valley of Mexico. As subjects of the Aztec Empire, the Tlatelolca formed part of the Aztec resistance to the Spaniards and fought them fiercely, refusing to surrender until the fugitive Aztec emperor Cuauhtémoc was captured. As such, the site was the setting for many bloody battles between the Spanish and the indigenous people. Shortly after the conquest of Mexico, the surviving populace of Tlatelolco were further decimated by several pandemics of smallpox, influenza, and hemorrhagic fever. As the indigenous peoples of the Americas had no immunity to the viruses that swept through the area these viruses were especially deadly and went on to kill thousands of men, women, and children. In the wake of this genocide, the nearly deserted city was repopulated by the Aztec survivors of the siege of Tenochtitlan, who the Spanish had forcibly removed from the crumbling ruins of their city. Many of the resettled survivors were ordered to build the Catholic church (which now overshadows the ruins) using the stones from the old temples. The ruins of the city lay forgotten under the pavement of the plaza until 1900, when constructions to build a new drainage system unearthed the pyramids. This discovery prompted the prominent Mexican archeologist Leopoldo Batres and his son to excavate the site. They made subsequent other discoveries, including skeletons that are now housed in the National Museum of Anthropology. Decades later, the skeletons of a man and a woman seemingly holding hands were unearthed and dubbed “the lovers of Tlatelolco.” In 2009, another new and shocking discovery surfaced. Archaeologists found a mass grave containing the remains of more than 50 adult men. Analysis revealed that the grave dated from the period of the Spanish conquest and that most of the skeletons belonged to young men who were in their early to mid-20s. Judging by their many broken and re-healed bones, they were probably Aztec warriors. Various theories have been put forward as to how these men died, but the most probable explanation is that they were prisoners of the Spanish who were, for unknown reasons, kept alive for a short period before being executed and buried in a mass grave.  The archeological site and its museum is open every day from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and the entrance fee costs 40 pesos. Get to Tlatelolco via the Mexico City metro.

237,Fuente de Tláloc,"Mexico City, Mexico",Diego Rivera's massive tiled fountain and failed infrastructure project.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aztec-rain-god-tlaloc-diago-rivera-fountain,"Just five years before his death, Diego Rivera finished one of his most intriguing works, la Fuente de Tláloc. Although strikingly different in medium from most of his work, the massive tiled fountain beautifully captures the essence of Native Mexican spirit and art that is so often depicted in his paintings. Known best for his murals, which he painted in Mexico, Europe and the United States, Rivera began a project in 1952 to improve the infrastructure of Mexico City, beginning with the municipal water system. Created at the head of the Lerma River leading out to the city’s reservoirs, Rivera created a massive tiled sculpture of the god of Rain, Tláloc, that spanned a pool 100 feet across. Constructed lying on his back, water used to rush over the god Tláloc, until a pipe diverted the flow of water away from the fountain. Rivera’s work of art then slowly decayed until it was eventually closed off for over a decade at the turn of the century. Finally, in 2010, the fountain, murals and tile work of the Mexican master were restored and visitors began to visit the unique Fuente de Tláloc. Along with the fountain, Rivera also built and decorated the Carcamo, a massive tank that diverted water through the fountain, and was used to control water levels. When the fountain was refinished, the Carcamo and its elegantly painted floors were touched up, letting Rivera’s work for Mexico City shine as a gallery and piece of artful infrastructure. The cost to enter the gallery is 35 pesos but the fountain is free to view.  When looking at the mural ""Water, the origin of life"" you will notice that Rivera portrayed quite a few salamander/newt-like creatures surrounding the male and female human figures. These animals are none other than the famous Axolotl (Ambystoma Mexicanum), a type of neotenic (meaning staying in larval state until adulthood, kind of like a ""forever young"") salamander found only in the lake of Xochimilco and currently a critically endangered species. These animals were included by Rivera in the mural due to the symbolic role they played to the Aztec civilization, which considered them a living embodiment of the god of lightning and death, Xolotl.",peculiar fountains fountains outsider architecture monuments architectural oddities architecture

The sprawling section is a feast for the senses. Multicolored piñatas and lollipops dangle overhead, while aromas of citrus, sugar, and spice waft from stalls.

Dedicated to Tepoztecatl, the Aztec god of Pulque, the shrine attracted pilgrims from as far away as Guatemala in its day. Today, the pyramid overlooks the quaint mountain town of Tepoztlan, known throughout Mexico for its supposed mysticism, far flung community of European and American expats, and production of Mezcal. The pyramid has two rooms inside, one opening out onto the monumental stairs and the other a smaller chamber in the interior. The hike from the town up to the archeological site is filled with spectacular waterfalls, dense sub tropical vegetation, rock formations that would make Dr. Seuss jealous, and playful coatis. The path leading up to the mountaintop temple tracks along beautiful ancient stairs before devolving into a trail of rough boulders. The final stretch before reaching the pyramid cuts right through a thin rock canyon that frames the edifice. The gorgeous forest hike makes it easy to see why the devoted would travel from other countries just to worship at El Tepozteco. If visiting Tepoztlan on a Friday morning, also be sure to visit the “Organic Farmers Market,” where the local expat community gathers to exchange goods and good times.  Follow Calle Del Tepozteco towards the jagged mountain peaks to the trail head, it's impossible to miss. Despite their cuteness and the temptation, try not to feed the clans of coatis that congregate around tourists at the top of the mountain begging to be fed.

240,Chapultepec Castle,"Mexico City, Mexico",The only castle in North America to ever house European sovereigns.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapultepec-castle,"When we think of castles we think of Europe and Asia, of the towering spires of Neuschwanstein and the massive courtyards and interlocking palaces that populate the Forbidden City. North America is not a continent that has a ton of “castle cred,” mostly because modern North American history (dating from the arrival of white settlers) is, for the most part, a history either of colonies or democracies. However, there is one structure on the North American continent that can truly claim to be a castle, Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City. Chapultepec has the rather dubious distinction of being the only castle within North America to ever house actual sovereigns. It was originally constructed in 1725 on the orders of the Viceroy Bernardo de Gálvez, and was meant to be a large manor house for the Viceroy, who was the commander-in-chief of the Spanish colony, New Spain. During the Mexican War of Independence the castle was abandoned, and remained in a state of dereliction for several decades. It was eventually refurbished and turned into a Military Academy. It was in this capacity that the castle served as the site of the Battle of Chapultepec during the Mexican-American War in 1847.  It was here according to folklore that six (possibly fictional) teenage cadets died defending the castle with one of the boys, Juan Escutia,  wrapping himself in the Mexican flag and jumping to his death from the battlements to avoid the dishonor of it being captured by the American invaders. With the rise of the Second Mexican Empire in 1864 the castle became the official residence of Emperor Maximilian I and his wife Empress Carlota. Maximilian, while in name and title the Emperor of Mexico, was in fact an Austrian prince of the Habsburg dynasty who was not ethnically Mexican at all, having been offered the crown by Mexican monarchists who were puppets of the French who sought to add Mexico to their empire. During this period the castle began to take on its current floor plan, with Maximilian hiring multiple architects to re-design the castle in the neo-classical style which was popular at the time. Unfortunately for Maximilian his reign, and with it the Second Mexican Empire, were brought to an abrupt halt only four years later in 1867 when the French were defeated and he was shot by firing squad along with several of his most loyal followers. He had been given the opportunity by Juarez to return to Europe but had decided to stay on due to his mothers harsh insistence on him staying and dying with dignity rather than return as a “coward” unworthy of the Hapsburg name.   With the establishment of the Mexican Republic under Benito Juárez Cahpultepec again began to fall into disuse and disrepair. Currently the castle is the seat of National Museum of Cultures, which was formerly known as the Museum of Natural History. It was established as such by Lázaro Cárdenas in 1939. In this capacity it is open to visitors who can come and tour both the castle itself and the various collections it now houses. Through the past decades it has become a favorite location of movie directors appearing in both Robert Aldrich’s Vera Cruz and Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo and Juliet.

The first three sculptures from the project were installed in November 2009 and proved a huge success. They were placed carefully in a section of the waters that has been hit repeatedly by hurricanes and tropical storms, leaving an ecosystem in need of regeneration and redevelopment. The rest of the sculptures will be installed before the end of 2010. Going forward, El Arte de Conservacion (The Art of Conservation) will be the museum’s motto and it will place a special emphasis on demonstrating the interaction between environmental science, humanity and art.",intriguing environs shops natural wonders ecosystems collections water nature architectural oddities museums and collections architecture
242,Pet Cemetery Cenote,"Tulum, Mexico","An ancient system of freshwater caves filled with animal bones, including that of species long-extinct.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pet-cemetery-cenote,"The remains of dead animals, tossed into the bottom of a cave away from the light of day who-knows-how-long ago, have resurfaced in a most unexpected way. Deep in the jungle outside Tulum, Mexico, divers, conservationists, and tourism leaders have combined forces to provide public access to this totally unique section of the world’s second-longest underwater cave system. Under continual exploration since its 1987 discovery, the Dos Ojos underwater cave system extends for an estimated 51 miles, filled with crystalline, balmy freshwater accessible via 28 known sinkholes – locally called “cenotes” (say-NOH-tays). Throughout the course of these explorations, a team of divers came upon a truly marvelous discovery. Its jaw-dropping rock formations are punctuated by stalactites and stalagmites, with pockets of darkness in which blind cave fish flourish. Most staggering of all, the bottom of the pool has a soft, dune-like surface which, when sifted, revealed unforeseen treasures: the pit was littered with animal bones ranging from ancient to the more familiar, including the lower jawbone of a tapir and the fossilized remains of an extinct prehistoric camel. Visitors to this site, which was nicknamed Pet Cemetery after these finds, with the proper credentials and training, can still see these skeletons and more, in their original positions. Scientists have pieced together a theory that the sinkhole was used as a disposal pit long ago, before the water table rose and flooded the animals’ mass grave. As with all underwater caves, this location is not suited for beginning SCUBA divers, as cavern and cave diving requires specialized training. Fully guided dives are available for those who believe they have proper experience. Snorkeling, however, is an option at the site that allows visitors of all ages and abilities to enjoy the myriad speleothems in this highly decorated cenote. With respect for the fragility and unique nature of the Pet Cemetery Cenote, which is filled with delicate, low-hanging stalactites and other formations, it is requested that interested divers and snorkelers choose their participation method according to their skill level, so as to best preserve the wonder for generations to come. Above ground, on the jungle trek en route to the cenote, living ancestors of these animals are on full parade. Spider monkeys are a common sight in the trees above, not to mention more common ground-dwelling creatures of rainforest climes, all of whom prove as equally awe-inspiring to divers above water, as their deceased brethren at rest below the waterline.

243,UNAM Botanical Garden,"Mexico City, Mexico",These biodiverse university gardens form a green oasis amid the urban chaos of Mexico City.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/unam-botanical-garden,"The botanical garden at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) was founded in 1959 by a pair of botanists who wanted to create a space on campus dedicated entirely to the study and preservation of Mexico’s extraordinarily diverse flora. Mexico is one of the most biodiverse countries in terms of its vegetation, home to more plant species than the U.S. and Canada combined. It also has the highest diversity of cactus plants in the world at an estimated 800 recorded species. Historically, Mexico City is no stranger to botanical gardens. The Aztec emperors kept numerous planted areas of ornamental, medicinal, and edible plants collected from all over the empire, long before the arrival of the Spanish. The UNAM botanical garden continues this tradition, but with an added focus on conservation, environmental education, and advancing botanical and taxonomic science. Fittingly, the collection has an enormous collection of endemic cacti, and many of the species on display here are highly endangered due to habitat destruction, overexploitation, and climate change. But the gardens contain much more than just cacti. There are areas planted with beautiful ornamental plants, a medicinal plant garden with species used traditionally by indigenous communities, an orchidarium, and many waterlily pools also home to plump koi carp and languid turtles. The green spaces here make for an ideal place to come and relax away from the chaos of Mexico City life. The garden is also notable for being built on and around strange volcanic rock formations that were formed by lava flows during the Xitle volcanic eruption, which destroyed the nearby Cuilcuilca civilization in Mexico’s distant past. As such, many of the gardens’ meandering footpaths pass under, over, and around naturally formed grottoes, ponds, mini waterfalls, and rockeries, making for a unique experience. Wildlife can be seen here, too, and it is a particularly good area to spot birds such as woodpeckers, owls, orioles, and hummingbirds. Also found here are reptiles like rattlesnakes, milksnakes, and lizards; numerous species of butterflies; and even the rare Pedregal tarantula, an endemic species that is found only in this small area of Mexico City.  The gardens can be reached by public transport such as the Metrobus (Dr Galvez or CCU stations), the metro (Universitario station) or by any of the buses heading to UNAM (get the Pumabus line). Once you reach the university, cross the campus, passing the stadium and the football pitches and head to the Institute of Ecology where you will find the entrance to the UNAM Botanical Garden (Jardín Botánico de UNAM) nearby. The gardens are free and open to the public from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday and on weekends from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The San Angel and Pedregal ecological reserve can also be found nearby, and is well worth a visit to explore and watch the wildlife.",biodiversity botanical gardens flora universities gardens plants
244,Nautilus House,"Naucalpan, Mexico",This fantastical house shaped like a seashell brings aquatic design to architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nautilus-house-seashell-architecture,"A young family tired of their conventional home yearned to live in something a little more intergrated with nature. Their wish was granted by Javier Senosiain of Senosiain Arquitectos, a celebrated Mexican architect whose work is considered both pioneering and controversial in the field of bioarchitecture. Instead of a boring old practical square dwelling, they now live inside a giant psychedelic mollusk shell. According to Senosiain, the Nautilus House is earthquake-proof and maintenance-free. While not the best use of space and decidedly short on storage, it’s hard not to be envious of the family who gets to come home to a wonderland straight out of a Lewis Carroll novel. Using a technique called ferrocement construction, a frame of steel-enforced chicken wire is coated with concrete, allowing for rounded, natural curves, the inside is full of spirals, circles, and organically shaped rooms that mimic the concave chambers one would expect inside a giant mollusk. Hundreds of small rainbow-colored stained-glass windows line spaces of ceiling and walls alike, sunning lush grass that surrounds flower-shaped couches. Using a pairing of artistic freedom and attention to detail, the Nautilus House is a wonderous demonstration of creating human abodes using nature’s design and possibly a mind-altering substance.",eccentric homes homes architectural oddities architecture
245,Museo Casa de León Trotsky,"Mexico City, Mexico",A museum in the former home of Marxist revolutionary Leon Trotsky.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-casa-de-leon-trotsky,"Following his exile from the Soviet Union in 1929, Leon Trotsky looked for asylum in European countries like France, Norway and Turkey. After being granted asylum in Mexico in 1936, this is the house Leon Trotsky lived with his wife Natalia Sedova in Mexico City and in which he was assassinated in 1940. The assassination would be carried out by a Spanish Stalinist called Ramón Mercader who gained access to Trotsky’s house by posing as a Canadian student called Jacson Mornard. Despite Leon’s many precautions which included watchtowers and fortifications that still stand in the house, Mercader would successfully attack him with a climbing axe in August 1940, leading to his death. The Soviet revolutionary would be mourned by Mexican intellectuals and friends like Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. Others more aligned with Stalinism, like fellow muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, would be less grieving. The bullet holes found in the house are the consequence of a previous attempt on Trotsky’s life that some theorize Siqueiros took place in. Following its declaration as a National Historic Monument in 1982, by 1990 the house was turned into a small museum preserving Trotsky’s personal items. The house and museum are also the home of an NGO dedicated to assisting asylum seekers in Mexico and throughout the world. In the backyard, visitors can find a tomb containing the ashes of both Trotsky and his wife.  Located in Coyoacán, just a few blocks from the Casa Azul. Open Tuesday through Sunday 10 am to 5pm. Cost is $40 MEX (about $2.19 USD). They also provide both Spanish and English guided tours for free.",communism politics houses homes museums
246,Café La Habana,"Mexico City, Mexico","This old-school café is famous for serving coffee, chilaquiles, and the Cuban Revolution.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cafe-la-habana,"Every revolutionary needs a signature drink. For Karl Marx, it was wine; for Thomas Jefferson, well, it was also wine. But as they sat in Mexico City plotting the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro and Ernesto “Che” Guevara preferred coffee. Legend has it, the pair met at Café La Habana on a weekly basis to sip cups of joe and plan their strategy for political and social reform. But to think that this cafe’s claim to fame begins and ends with Castro and Guevara would be misleading, as it wasn’t just the haunt of political revolutionaries but also revolutionary writers. Some of the regulars who changed Latin American literature as we know it were known to sit for hours in the cafe, chain-smoking and discussing their ideas. Since La Habana’s opening in 1952, it’s played host to Gabriel García Márquez, Roberto Bolaño, and Octavio Paz. Crowds of journalists from nearby newspapers have also kept the conversation and coffee flowing. The cafe’s fame among cultural greats has, in fact, become something of a trope: Today, Mexican politicians frequent the spot when they want some positive publicity. In the cafe’s old-school interior, the scent of coffee and huevos al gusto mixes with the sound of conversation and the clank and sputter of espresso machines. It’s easy to imagine how the place looked, smelled, and felt in the 1950s (a little smokier, perhaps, but more or less the same). The walls remind patrons of this storied history, showing off black and white photographs of Mexico City and Havana, Cuba. The menu offers unfussy classics, including chilaquiles, molletes, and coffee roasted and ground on site, brought by waiters so seasoned they may well have served Che. While the chilaquiles and club sandwiches are pretty good, the food overall is average. But patrons should not come to the establishment to savor the food, but to sit, contemplate, have a strong café americano, and soak up its nearly 70 years of history.  The cafe continues to inspire contemporary art: In 2017, the singer Patti Smith staged a two-week Mexico City exhibition and performance series based on La Habana.",cuba revolution communism coffee restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars
247,Palenque,"Palenque, Mexico",An elaborate Mayan city shrouded in alien conspiracy revealed the tomb of Pacal the Great.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palenque-2,"In 1746, a Spanish priest and his family discovered the ruins of Palenque while looking for new lands to cultivate. The first Europeans to lay eyes upon the magnificent site were so impressed, they were convinced that the Greeks or Romans had to be involved. It seemed impossible that anyone else could be responsible for such sophisticated and intricate work. Even the artists sent to draw copies of the elaborate reliefs and sculptures couldn’t help but make King Pacal look more than a little bit like Apollo. In 1786, King Charles the III of Spain demanded samples from the area, and the pillaging was not gentle. In the process of removing an elaborate carving on the leg of a throne, the entire throne collapsed, and gaping holes were left where the best examples of glyphs were found. However, his marauders missed the real treasure that wasn’t uncovered until much later. In 1949, Mexican archaeologists led by Alberto Ruz began excavations in earnest. In the Temple of Inscriptions, holes in the floor indicated something beneath. After three years of digging through rubble-filled descending staircases and walled-in corridors, archaeologists hit the jackpot. A sarcophagus measuring 13-feet-by-seven-feet, weighing five tons, and covered with bas-reliefs sat in the center of a room decorated with murals and full of offerings. Beneath the stone slab lay the jade-laden body of King Pacal, who ruled until he died at the impressive age of 80. The imagery carved into the face of the slab has been the subject of conspiracy theorists and alien chasers. From a Mayan archaeological viewpoint, the relief depicts the dead king, atop the setting sun, falling into the gaping jaws of the earth monster. From his body grows the Ceiba tree with a celestial bird perched on top. About the same time the Mayan doomsday calendar theory popped up, those with wild imaginations turned the image sideways for a new interpretation. The image, they said, clearly depicts the king sitting behind the controls of a spaceship, his fingers turning dials, as he navigates his way back to the mothership. Obviously, the opinion that such “primitive” people as the Maya could not possibly have achieved such architectural feats without modern machinery or contact with the civilizations of the old world, has persevered. The discovery of Palenque forever changed the study of Mayan archaeology as temples were now viewed to have a similar purpose as ancient Egyptian pyramids—important people were interred in them. Similar discoveries were made in Tikal shortly after.",lost cities lost tribes mayan ruins
248,Chichen Itza Chirp,"Chichen Itza, Mexico","Clap your hands at the base of the pyramid, and the song of a sacred Mayan bird will echo through the air.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chichen-itza-chirp,"The Mayan city of Chichen Itza is full of architectural and engineering marvels. Every equinox, an enormous snake born from the shadows slithers down the side of the Temple of Kukulcan. But the pyramid does more than put on this spectacular light show. Clap your hands at the base of the stairs, and an echo will ring through the air. It isn’t an ordinary booming echo, either. It sounds like the song of a ghostly flock of birds, a chorus of chirps that crescendos before fading into silence. During ceremonies when Kukulcan was being called upon or worshipped, a priest would face the pyramid and clap, creating the chirp. He’d then turn and face the Temple of Warriors and clap again, causing a low rattle to seemingly emit from the rocks. The chirp and rasping whisper of an echo were believed to be the voice of the god. The birdsong may be no coincidence. According to some acoustic specialists, it mirrors the call of the resplendent quetzal, a gorgeous bird cloaked in an opulent array of green and red feathers. Like the snake, the quetzal was considered divine by the Maya. This “god of the air” was a symbol of goodness and light. Its tail feathers adorned the headdresses of many a noble (no birds died during the creation of the headdresses, as killing a sacred quetzal was forbidden). The warbling echo was first studied in 1998 and has been intriguing scholars ever since. It’s unclear whether the Maya intentionally crafted the pyramid with such an effect in mind. Some argue they did in fact begin building the stone behemoth knowing its tiered stairs would manipulate sounds and let it sing the song of their sacred bird. Others speculate they stumbled upon the acoustic marvel by accident, then later tweaked the architecture to enhance the effect. Sadly for the quetzal, increasing habitat loss and illegal trafficking is threatening the magnificent species. Fragmented pockets of their population have already been extirpated, and their future as a whole remains uncertain. Should the species perish, their song will still linger within the jungle, thanks to the eerie chirps echoing up the stairs of the Temple of Kukulcan.",acoustics mayan wondrous performances sounds birds ancient ruins animals

Come 8:00 p.m., however, and this humble garage becomes home to several spinning spits of some of the finest marinated meat in Mexico City. Servers wielding giant knives slice off chunks of the succulent pork and layer it onto corn tortillas, along with a flick of pineapple and a sprinkling of onions and cilantro to make stunningly sweet and savory al pastor tacos. Even though the mechanics are long gone, hints of the space’s body shop alter ego remain: a sign displaying a giant red car hovers overhead and services are emblazoned across the red-and-black exterior, offering to improve your ride’s lubricación, suspensión, or transmisión. There are several tables and chairs inside part of the garage next to the open kitchen, but it’ll be easiest to grab a standing table outside.

250,National Museum of Death,"Aguascalientes, Mexico",A uniquely robust and historic look at Mexico's omnipresent dance with Death.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-museum-of-death,"Eerie, funny, and sometimes intense, this museum explores Mexico’s ever-present relationship with death. Located in the city of Aguascalientes, the National Museum of Death opened to the public in the summer of 2007 as a permanent collection belonging to the University of Aguascalientes, after the institution inherited hundreds of death-related artifacts amassed over Octavio Bajonero Gil’s lifetime, including some of his own artwork. Seven years into its operation, however, the mission of the Museum was refined, as its collection expanded in the direction of depicting the historic role of death’s iconography and the funereal arts within Mexican culture, both contemporary and ancient. Integral in this expansion were artifacts from the personal collection of one Daniel Mercurio López Casillas. Throughout this process of the investigation, the Museum’s curators conveyed the wide range of Mexican society’s relationship towards death and Santa Muerte himself, ranging from the popular portrayal of a people who are always joking and laughing about mortality, to the nitty gritty — sometimes quite graphic — reality of death most corporeal. Paintings, sculptures, lithographs, and photos are used to illustrate points along the way, explaining the relationship of Mexico’s culture with death via images rather than words. Step by step, the Museum takes its visitors through a history of death,  across the land now known as Mexico. Starting in the Pre-Hispanic era, the exhibits follow a timeline through the periods of the Spanish Conquistadors’ domination and decimation of the native civilizations, to the reassertion of Mexican independence, up to the contemporary period, including the international community’s appropriation of the sugar skull in pop culture. What results is an experience described by a recent visitor as an “interesting surprise,” particularly vibrant and multifaceted given what could easily have come off as gloomy, dismal subject matter.",saints rites and rituals death collections museums and collections museums
251,Hierve El Agua,"San Pablo Villa de Mitla, Mexico",This beautifully deceptive waterfall is something far different from what it appears to be.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hierve-el-agua-1,"Sometimes nature creates counterfeits: a fish that looks like a plant, a fruit that looks like a vegetable, or in the case of Mexico’s Hierve El Agua, a rock formation that looks like a waterfall. Sounds unusual? It is. At a distance, this enormous rock structure looks exactly like a frozen waterfall, a seeming impossibility in the hot temperatures of San Lorenzo Albarradas, the town closest to the rock. If you come closer to the formation, however, you realize your eyes have played a trick on you. The rocks are, in fact, mineral deposits on top of a limestone mountain. On the mountain’s ledges sit two fresh water pools noted for their medicinal properties, and springs that are saturated with calcium carbonate and magnesium. Subsequently, the water from the pools drips down through the cliffs, depositing the minerals onto the side of the mountain. Over time, these deposits have accumulated in staggered columns that look an awful lot like icy cold waterfalls. The name of the place, literally “the water boils” in Spanish, comes from the way the water bubbles as it travels through the spring. The Zapotec people, who lived in the area more than 2,000 years ago, revered these pools and directed the spring waters to irrigate their plants. The canals created by these people have petrified into this unusual rock sight in the subsequent passage of time. This result, which took thousands of years to create, is essentially an above-ground stalactite that hangs more than 50 meters from the bottom of the valley. The waterfall misnomer is perpetuated with the name of the rock formations, dubbed salt waterfalls or petrified waterfalls. The park’s hours aren’t the most consistent, so make sure to call ahead before setting out to see these unusual “falls”.  Take the Fletes y Pasajes bus out of either Oaxaca City or Mitla. Your stop will be the Hierve El Agua side road, which is 11 miles past Mitla. Here, ride the San Lorenzo bus to the Hierve El Agua stop.

252,Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve,"El Rosario, Mexico",The winter home of millions of migrating monarch butterflies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monarch-butterfly-biosphere-reserve,"Millions of monarch butterflies—enough to cover entire fir forests—migrate every winter from Canada to the mountains of the central highlands of Mexico, creating a swarm of beautiful insects. But there is nothing to fear. These butterflies are remarkably tame and even land all over the hands and heads of visiting tourists. In 1940, Canadian entomologist Fred Urquhart and his wife Norah Urquhart started a project to learn more about monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) migration routes. Helped by many American citizen scientists, they found plenty of wintering sites in the United States. However, the butterflies arriving in Texas seemed to suddenly disappear. A fellow entomologist, Kenneth Brugger, traveled through Mexico, following the monarch butterflies’ migration. In 1975, he found a spot in the mountains in the state of Michoacan, Mexico, where the butterflies spent the winter months. Since then, those peaks have become a tourist attraction. Now, to protect the butterflies, this place has become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The government of Mexico has turned it into a biosphere reserve. During the winter months, all the trees go from green to orange due to the large number of butterflies that live in and on them. The sky looks full of the picturesque creatures. The reserve is also covered by forests of sacred firs inhabited by a variety of other species of wildlife. But good luck finding them underneath those butterflies.

Still abandoned, the crumbling facade is a gloomy yet visually stunning testament to the glamorous peak of the country’s film industry. The 70-year-old theater sits on a quiet side street in Mexico City’s Colonia San Rafael, a neighborhood that was once known for its stage and movie theaters, but later fell on hard times and became something of a red light district. After experiencing a decline in the 1970s and 80s, the Cine was briefly used as a concert hall starting in 1993, hosting the likes of Bauhaus and Human Drama, but this phase was short-lived, and the theater was closed down permanently in 1998. Recently, the neighborhood of San Rafael has seen a resurgence, but Cine Ópera still sits empty and derelict, its Art Deco architecture and artifacts decaying. This decay has yielded a building that seems to have been transported from another era, shrouded in local legend, including ghost stories. In 2011, the Cine was acquired by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, Mexico’s national art institute, with the goal of transforming it into a cultural center.

As intriguing as it is, though, MODO’s collection of almost 100,000 objects is almost secondary to the museum’s primary goal of serving as an homage to the collector in all of us. The foundation for the museum was provided by the private collection of Bruno Newman, whose interest in beautiful, rare, obscure, or otherwise interesting items led him to amass 30,000 such objects over a period of 40 years. His curios first decorated his coffee table, then a full room in his home, and eventually a warehouse. The collection included everything from turn-of-the-century French lotion to shaving implements to old bouillon cans. Ultimately, he decided to make his collection available for the public to study and enjoy, converting his 1906 Art Nouveau mansion into an exhibition space and naming it the Museo del Objeto del Objeto (“Museum of the Object [as in purpose] of the Object”), which opened in 2010. MODO was established not only to showcase the fascinating and curious objects collected by Newman and others, but also to chronicle the history and culture of commercial, promotional, and advertorial design in Mexico and elsewhere. It also celebrates Mexico’s thriving collecting scene — whether the collectibles are sneakers, skateboards, or post cards. The oldest object in the museum dates back to 1810, and taken together, the collection provides an intriguing look at the design of the relatively mundane items people have interacted with on a daily basis over the past 200 years. Given the large size of the collection and the comparatively small exhibition space available, all exhibits are temporary and rotate regularly.There’s a closed door (sometimes for a couple of weeks) when exhibitions rotate so be prepared to change plans if that’s the case.",design shops museums and collections museums
256,Secrets of Puebla Tunnels,"Puebla, Mexico",A 500-year-old series of tunnels long believed to be folkloric was uncovered beneath the streets of Puebla.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/secrets-of-puebla-tunnel,"In the alley of Cinco de Mayo Road, there’s a doorway leading underground that looks to be an entrance to a subway. But in Puebla, there are no subways. It is, in fact, the tiny entrance to a recently discovered secret of the city, a tunnel system used to connect a fort with the baroque city of Puebla. The underground tunnel system dates back to 1531, but wasn’t unearthed and opened to the public until 2016. It had been covered for decades, and the archeologist who unearthed the tunnel discovered antiques in the mud. Today it operates as a museum that doubles as a citywide thoroughfare. Many Mexican cities have legends about secret tunnels lying just beneath the streets, used during the revolution either by royalty or even during the inquisition. Grandparents would tell these folk stories to children. The discovery of the Puebla tunnel lends some credence to the folklore. The tunnel—tall enough that a person could comfortably ride through on horseback—originates in the historic center of Puebla and lets out to the Loreto fort, where the Cinco de Mayo battle against the French army occurred. Archeologists first discerned that it was a complex sewer system, but another discovery led them to believe that people also used the tunnels for secret travel. Along with toys, marbles, and antique kitchen goods, a lot of guns, bullets, and gunpowder were found trapped in the mud. The weaponry was mostly from the mid-19th century, around the time of the Battle of Puebla conflict between Mexico and France. Investigators believe these tunnels may have been used by soldiers during the war of Mexican liberation, though they also could have been used by clergy or even common folk. The tour across the tunnel includes a guided visit by archaeologists who worked on the project and displays where one can see the items that lay in the mud for so long.

The Museo de Arte Popular embraces these uniquely Mexican crafts, displaying some of the weirdest and most wonderful religious articles, dioramas, monsters, skeletons, piñatas, and pottery you are likely to see anywhere. Octavio Paz famously wrote about the legendary treatment of death in Mexican culture: “The Mexican chases after death, mocks it, courts it, hugs it, and sleeps with it. He thinks of it as his favorite plaything and his most lasting love.” Whether or not this is broadly true, the Museo de Arte Popular demonstrates the cultural importance of death in the country, and especially the Día de Muertos, through folk art traditions around the country. Skulls and skeleton figures of all sizes, shapes, and materials abound in the collection, and the museum hosts special celebrations on the Day of the Dead. The brightly lit main atrium of the museum also features a wall decorated by a jumble of alebrijes, gigantic and fantastical animal figures like flies with dragon tails and multi-headed lions, all painted with neon colors. Once a year, the museum puts on a carnival-like parade of these sculptures. Alebrijes were created by Mexico City artisan Pedro Linares. They are also very popular in the southern state of Oaxaca, whose artisans still make some of the largest and most outlandish sculptures for the parade. If you are walking down Mexico City’s monumental Paseo de la Reforma in October and encounter a parade of psychedelic papier-mâché creatures marching towards you, just know the Museo de Arte Popular is responsible.  If you want to take some colorful and vibrant Mexican handicrafts back home from your travels then check out the museum gift shop which is stocked with alebrijes, Día de Muertos skulls, pottery, and many more cultural treasures. Like most Mexico City museums, the MAP is closed on Mondays. Open all other days, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Wednesdays when closing time is extended to 9 p.m.",art deco culture death outsider art museums and collections museums
259,Taquería Los Cocuyos,"Mexico City, Mexico",This one-window stand has been home to a giant vat of slowly simmering meats and an array of unique tacos for almost 50 years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/los-cocuyos-tacos,"Blink and you might miss Los Cocuyos, a single-window taquería in Mexico City’s Centro Histórico. But you won’t need your eyes to find this spot: Just follow your nose as the aroma of marinating meat dances down the street. Half the window at this small, nearly 50-year-old stand is occupied by a giant vat of bubbling sausage, tripe, and tender cuts of beef, slowly cooking to perfection. Any order will suit you fine at Cocuyos—their suadero (brisket) tacos are particularly incredible—but for those wanting to sample something a bit more unique, the stand offers an array of fillings that you won’t find at just any old taco joint. Many options provide texturally delightful alternatives to the usual carnitas or chorizo, from tacos de sesos (brains), which have a creamy consistency that melts into the corn tortilla, to diced ojos (eyeballs), which offer a gelatinous punch. Other options include tacos de cabeza (slices of beef cheek or other parts of the face), chewy lengua (tongue), and longaniza (sausage). Order your tacos con todo (“with everything”) if you want a healthy sprinkling of onions and cilantro. There’s a condiments station, as well, so you can load up on radishes, lime, and hot sauce.",taco midnight munchies meat street food
260,Museo Dolores Olmedo,"Mexico City, Mexico",This extraordinary art museum is like a secret world on the edge of Mexico City.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-dolores-olmedo,"The eclectic collection at the Museo Dolores Olmedo includes a treasure trove of folk art representing traditions from the many diverse cultures of Mexico. It also boasts one of the largest exhibits of paintings by the famous Mexican artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Riviera, who were close friends of the museum’s founder, businesswoman and art collector Dolores Olmedo. Housed in a colonial hacienda, the museum displays a large range of artifacts gathered during Olmedo’s lifetime, including several 17th-century Japanese and Chinese prints, lacquer, and ivory carvings. Yet the highlight of the museum may be its enormous collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts from civilizations such as the Olmec, Aztec, Huastecas, and Maya, many of which portray the Xoloitzcuintle dog, the emblem of the museum. On the museum grounds, a large enclosure houses an actual living pack of these unique dogs, an ancient hairless breed that was a favorite pet of Olmedo’s and was considered sacred by the Aztecs, who believed the animals guided the dead through the underworld. Here too are flocks of African guinea fowl and geese, pheasants, bantam chickens, and muscovy ducks. But it’s the peacocks that really steal the show with their psychedelic plumage. They strut around the courtyards spreading out their tail feathers in front of admiring visitors in what seems to be a dazzling performance of vanity. The gardens have a captivating charm, with sprawling lawns lined by gigantic eucalyptus and gnarled cypress trees. The grounds are dotted by large agave plants and cacti which, judging by their size, must be decades old, while colorful ornamental vines adorn all of the museum buildings in living walls of vibrant red, orange, and purple flowers.  The Dolores Olmedo Museum is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The entrance fee is $100 pesos or $50 pesos for Mexican citizens, foreign residents, and students. To get there via public transportation, take the tren ligero train to ""La Noria"" station which is located three blocks from the museum. The little cafe/restaurant at the back of the gardens is excellent and serves some delicious traditional dishes and a good cup of coffee or tea. Cultural events are also held monthly at the museum; past events have included live jazz concerts and modern art exhibitions. The museum also hosts an extravagant annual display that coincides with the Dia de Los Muertos (Day of the Day), featuring hundreds of colorful and humorous skeleton scenes.",mesoamerica cultures mayan aztec art museum artifacts culture paintings cultures and civilizations gardens archaeology collections plants museums and collections art museums
261,Sótano de las Golondrinas (Cave of Swallows),"Huehuetlán, Mexico",The largest cave shaft in the world is home to thousands of birds and popular with BASE jumpers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cave-of-swallows-sotano-de-las-golondrinas,"Simply staring down into the Cave of Swallows is a test of one’s fortitude. Known as a pit cave, it is a vertical shaft, essentially a 160- to 205-foot gaping hole in the forest floor which drops straight down 1,220 feet – 1,904 from the higher edge – before reaching the cave floor. It is deep enough to fit the Statue of Liberty standing on her own shoulders, the Eiffel tower, or the Chrysler building. Called Sótano de las Golondrinas in Spanish and the Cave of Swallows in English, it is the largest known cave shaft in the world and the second deepest pit in Mexico. The cave gets its name from the green parakeets and white-collared swifts that live along its walls. Each day the birds fly in concentric circles up the cave shaft before the flocks come spilling out of the of the hole into the jungle. The cave has more recently become the home to a number of newer aerial species, namely vertical cavers and base-jumpers. A popular destination with the extreme sports enthusiasts, it is tall enough for the BASE jumpers (BASE stands for Buildings, Antennas, Spans, and Earth, all things they enjoy flinging themselves off of) to leap off the edge and free-fall for a couple of seconds before deploying their parachutes. While it takes about ten seconds to reach the bottom, the ascent back up is slower taking between 40 minutes and 2 hours. While the cave has long been known to the local Huastec people, it was first explored by outsiders in 1966 by T. R. Evans, Charles Borland and Randy Sterns. The cave is so deep that when rappelling, which can easily take an hour, the friction can cause the rope and equipment to heat up to dangerous levels, so spray water bottles are used to cool the equipment as one descends.",birds geological oddities caves ecosystems geology animals
262,Museo de las Momias de Guanajuato,"Guanajuato, Mexico","Mexico's astounding mummy museum with ""the world's smallest mummy.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-de-las-momias-de-guanajuato,"Locations of extreme cold, very dry regions, and bogs are all places in which bodies will naturally mummify, sometimes found thousands of years later. In the case of the Guanajuato mummies, the subjects only had to wait a few hundred years, and were not so much discovered as evicted. From 1865 to 1958, the town of Guanajuato, Mexico, required that relatives pay a grave tax. When the relatives failed to do so for three years in a row, their deceased loved ones were promptly dug up and evicted. Weirdly, due to the extremely dry conditions of the soil, the corpses often came up as well-preserved mummies. (The first to be dug up and found mummified was one Dr. Remigio Leroy on June 9, 1865.) The cemetery kept these strange mummified corpses underground in an ossuary — actually under the cemetery grounds itself —  in case the relatives came around with the money wanting a re-burial. By 1894, the ossuary had racked up enough mummified bodies to rebrand itself as a museum. Though the practice ended in 1958 (three years before the first man flew into space), the mummies continued to be kept in the local ossuary/museum. In 1970, a Mexican b-horror movie was produced there called Santo Versus the Mummies of Guanajuato, starring masked wrestler Rodolfo Guzmán Huerta. As the mummies gained notoriety, they drew interested visitors. For many years the unfortunate specimens were displayed propped against the walls of the ossuary, but these days they are housed in a more official museum cases. Because they were formed naturally, the mummies are more gruesome-looking than your standard Egyptian mummy. With gaunt and twisted faces, often covered in the tattered rags they were buried in, the mummies stand, lean, and recline in glass cases throughout the museum. Perhaps the most shocking to visitors are the pregnant mummy and the shrunken child mummies, including “the world’s smallest mummy,” which is no bigger than a loaf of bread. It is still unknown what quality of the soil or the environment of this particular cemetery produces so many natural mummies, and the mystery has given way to many superstitions about them. A common local belief is that the mummification is divine punishment for acts committed while alive. There is a gift shop in the museum that sells sugar skulls and effigies of the mummies, as well as grotesque postcards featuring pictures of the mummies and lowbrow jokes in Spanish.  If you take a city bus (marked ""Las Momias""), ask the bus driver to point out the street that leads to the museum. You will walk uphill until you see a big stone wall without windows. To go straight to the museum, turn right and follow that wall to its end. Then you will see a lot of souvenir stands. Turn left and walk until you find the ticket window. If you want to visit the cemetery first, do not turn at the big stone wall, but instead, walk uphill just a little more and you will see the entrance to your right. The graveyard is worth a look if you like that kind of thing. You cannot get to the museum from the cemetery. You must walk around to the other side and below—the museum is actually underneath the graveyard! Don't take the short tour or a trip as part of a general tour of the city, as you will not have enough time to appreciate these ghastly cadavers. Instead, make sure you have at least an hour or two to walk around.",world's smallest ossuaries mummies catacombs and crypts museums
263,Pyramids of Tenayuca,"Tlalnepantla, Mexico",A barbarous band of serpents guard the bases of these Aztec temples.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramids-of-tenayuca,"On the outskirts of Mexico City stand the ruins of an ancient pyramid that is surrounded by what appears to be an army of stone serpents. Xolotl, a leader of the Chichimecas (“Barbarians” in Nahuatl) who settled at Tenayuca, built a fortified city here as a capital for his people. In subsequent generations, this center lost much of its power and was moved to Tetzcoco. As a settlement of now secondary importance, Tenayuca experienced a second wave of invasion by a coalition of other Chichimeca tribes in the late 1200s, from whom would eventually emerge the Aztecs. After the site came under Aztec control, an elaborate pyramid complex was constructed. A series of stone coatepantlis (serpent walls) was made to surround the base of the pyramid. Archeologists believe the Aztecs may have been inspired by those at the Toltec city of Tula, where these structures first appeared. This imitation may have served a function as either a homage to the great power of Central Mexico that had preceded their own or as a visual symbol to legitimize their own rule as rightful “heirs” of the Toltec mantle of empire. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area in 1519, they dubbed it “El Pueblo de los Serpientes” (“The Town of the Serpents”). The Spaniards defeated the city’s native inhabitants in 1520. In the long centuries that followed, Tenayuca was forgotten and became covered by layers of sediment. In the 1920s, a renewed interest by professional archeologists in Mexico’s pre-Columbian past led to the site’s excavation.  The pyramid and its museum are open to the public Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The entrance fee is 55 pesos.",snakes pyramids aztec cities temples ancient archaeology abandoned ruins

The market’s vendors range from profferers of hyper-local ingredients, to gourmet hawkers offering delights from the northern parts of the Americas, Europe, and beyond. Whether you’re looking for seasonally available chapulines  and escamoles (pre-Spanish staples: grasshoppers and ant eggs), or perfect, plump artichokes, or bags of edible flowers (or various flours), or ostrich eggs, or recently slaughtered goats, or even fresh mozzarella, Mercado San Juan can provide. More adventurous diners can patron stands that flip burgers purportedly made from puma, crocodile, armadillo, and roadrunner meat, although to do so would be contributing to the illegal trade in wildlife currently causing Mexico’s crisis in biodiversity conservation. Established in 1955, the current market building developed on the site of the former warehouses of the Buen Tono cigar company. Today, it follows in the tradition of many Mexican markets in that it provides a social atmosphere where you can talk to vendors and sample their wares. However, Mercado San Juan remains remarkably unique to CDMX in that it uses a familiar setting to highlight and celebrate a diversity of food cultures from around the world.

265,Rosary Chapel,"Puebla, Mexico","The splendor of this 17th century golden chapel has led it to be called the ""eighth wonder of the world.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rosary-chapel,"Built in the 17th century, this golden temple has amazed its visitors so much that since its earliest days it has been called the “eighth wonder of the world.” Found inside the Church of Santo Domingo in the city of Puebla, not far from Mexico City, the Rosary Chapel could arguably be the best example of the New Spanish Baroque style. Its purpose was to honor the Virgin Mary as well as to teach the locals the practice of the rosary, of which the Dominicans (the order in charge of the temple), were ardent promoters. Built between 1650 and 1690, the Rosary Chapel features an astonishing artistic work, mixing the traditional Catholic symbols with those of the region under prominent gold leaf that makes the place shine with ethereal light from the windows right under its dome. The chapel features on its walls six paintings telling the biblical story of Jesus from his birth to his debate with the doctors at the temple, all of which feature the Virgin Mary and are called Gozos de la Virgen, also underneath the paintings there is a succession of blue and white ceramic tiles known as Talaveras de Puebla, that actually form a gigantic rosary itself, with each bead being represented as an angel’s head. Right under the dome there is an altar and a baldachin (also called Ciprés in Mexican spanish), the latter made in marble but covered in gold, with a represen-tation of Our Lady of the Rosary in the first level, a statue of Saint Dominic in the second, and a figure of Archangel Gabriel atop. Although there are several works of art trying to match the splendor and grandiosity of this temple, the Rosary Chapel stands out not only for being located in a place where gold was scarce, but also because its 23-carat gold leaf has remained attached to the decorations for more than 300 years, partially due to the composition of the glue used, that some local guides claim was composed of aloe, honey, bull’s blood and egg whites (although a restoration made in the 1970s might have helped too). While in Puebla, do not hesitate to visit this fantastic work of religious architecture to appreciate all of its details and works.

266,Chicxulub Crater,Mexico,"World's third largest impact crater, and where the fate of the dinosaurs was sealed.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chicxulub-crater,"Buried beneath thousands of feet of limestone in the Yucatán Peninsula are the remains of an impact so great that it wiped out over half of the Earth’s species. The Chicxulub Crater, named after the village which lies near its center, spans over 110 miles wide, with about half of it resting below the Gulf of Mexico. Some 65 million years ago, an asteroid or comet the size of a small city came hurtling toward Earth. With a force of 100 million megatons of TNT (two million times stronger than the most powerful man-made bomb), it crashed into our planet and created devastating consequences for both the dinosaurs and all other life. Shockwaves rippled outwards from the site, triggering earthquakes and volcanic eruptions across the world. In the oceans, the explosion unleashed megatsunamis measuring thousands of meters high. Massive amounts of debris from the impactor and the Earth were kicked up into the atmosphere and beyond. Some of the larger ejected chunks came speeding back down, igniting in the atmosphere and setting off global firestorms. Meanwhile, the sky darkened as a cloud of dust covered the Earth, blocking sunlight and preventing photosynthesis for years. After millions of years of erosion and sedimentation, however, evidence of the cataclysmic event is hard to come across today. Even for a spectator standing high above the crater’s center, the impact’s effects are not apparent. Perhaps the most telling features of the surrounding landscape are the cenotes. These water-filled sinkholes, once used by the Mayans in sacrificial ceremonies, dot the crater’s edge where the rock was weakened. In fact, it was not until 1978 that the Chicxulub Crater was finally unearthed. The discovery is generally attributed to Glen Penfield, a geophysicist who noticed the region’s unusual features while working for the Mexican oil company Pemex. While examining a magnetic survey map of the Gulf of Mexico, Penfield observed a semicircular arc suggesting the presence of an impact crater. Unbeknownst to him, a former Pemex employee had noted a similar anomaly in a gravity map of the Yucatán. However, the petroleum company prohibited this worker from publishing his findings and the map’s significance went unrealized for years before Penfield used it to confirm his suspicions. Just a few years later, researchers like the father-and-son geology team of Luis and Walter Alvarez and the graduate student Alan Hildebrand published controversial articles that suggested a large impact from an asteroid caused the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. As evidence, scientists relied on a 65-million year old layer of iridium-enriched clay named the K-T boundary. They argued that only a collision with a large extraterrestrial body could account for the levels of iridium (a rare element of relative abundance in meteorites) present in the rock, and the worldwide distribution of the boundary layer. It was also predicted and later confirmed that the extreme pressures and temperatures associated with the violent explosion would have ejected and widely distributed “shocked quartz” (a deformed type of the familiar crystalline solid) and tektites (spherules of natural glass rock). While science inched closer to a reasonable explanation for the demise of the dinosaurs, another decade passed before Chicxulub was realized as the remains of the catastrophic event. This occurred in 1990, when a newspaper reporter informed Hildebrand of Penfield’s work and the two scientists began working together on Pemex drill samples from the site. Soon enough, the crater’s age and properties were confirmed to correlate with predictions. Today, Chicxulub remains a hot topic of study. Some researchers use computer models to recreate the formation scenario and explain the crater’s structural changes, while others are concerned with tracing the impacting body back to its initial home in the main asteroid belt. Perhaps the most controversial work, though, involves pinpointing the exact events that led to the dinosaur’s extinction. There is considerable disagreement in the scientific community regarding whether the impact was isolated or part of a relatively short epoch of collisions in which the proceeding periods of global cooling and warming finally finished off the ill-fated beasts. Whatever the case may be, impacts the size of Chicxulub occur on Earth about once every 100 million years, making the crater in Mexico a humbling and perhaps unsettling reminder of life’s fragility.",craters meteorites long now locations dinosaurs disaster areas geological oddities geology animals
267,Pyramid of Ehécatl,"Mexico City, Mexico",The ruins of an ancient temple to the Aztec wind god discovered in the middle of a metro station.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-of-ehecatl,"In 1967, construction workers building the Mexico City metro system unearthed, to their surprise, a strange edifice harking back to ancient times. Archeologists were brought in to excavate the site and discern the significance of this discovery. Unearthed from the rubble and dust accumulated over the centuries, the structure was eventually identified as being the only surviving remnant of a temple complex dedicated to the Aztec wind god Ehécatl. The circular and mound-like shape of the pyramid is believed to be a reference to a coiled snake. The god of the wind was conceived by the ancient Aztecs as simply a manifestation of a much more powerful and central deity, the plumed serpent god and creator of mankind, Quetzalcoatl. Today, you can see and appreciate this mysterious ancient shrine right from the bustling passageways of the Pino Suárez Metro Station that surrounds it on all sides, juxtaposing Mexico City’s dizzying modernity with the antiquity of its Aztec past. Be sure to stop and take a breather and, fittingly, savor the breeze that blows from above.  You can find the temple in the middle of Metro Pino Suárez, in the passageway between line 1 (Pink line, direction: Metro Observatorio to Metro Pantitlan) and line 2 (Blue line, direction: Metro Cuatro Caminos to Metro Tasqueña).

And they both terminate in the picturesque Arch of Cabo San Lucas. Hugged by the Playa del Amor on the gulf side and the Playa del Divorcio on the ocean side, the limestone arch—known locally, and appropriately, as El Arco—was carved over millennia by the same winds and potent tidal forces that make swimming on the latter a potentially lethal and thus decidedly ill-advised proposition. The arch provides an attractive photo destination for visitors to nearby Cabo San Lucas. It also serves as a popular hangout for sea lions, who congregated at the spot long before Cabo became a whole thing. Inaccessible by land, those keen to visit this tasteful piece of organic architecture should hail a boat taxi in Cabo San Lucas Marina and say, “Take me to Land’s End, please!,” which is another name for it.

At Mexico City’s Museo del Estanquillo, climbing past the last floor rewards visitors with great open views of the surroundings. The Museo del Estanquillo (“estanquillo” is a term used to refer to small shops, similar to a sundries store or a modern-day convenience store or bodega) houses the personal collections of well-known writer and Mexico City chronicler Carlos Monsiváis. The Museum was inaugurated in 2006, four years before Monsiváis’s death. Its rooftop terrace now hosts the cafeteria as well as an additional small gift shop and occasional events. While there a few views similar to what this terrace offers, El Estanquillo’s stands apart as, unlike terraces along Madero Street that belong to bars and restaurants, it is free of charge. From it, visitors can appreciate the eclectic Mexico City Centro architecture. The Neoclassical Old La Mexicana Insurance Building, contemporary of La Esmeralda, dominates the view across Madero. On the opposite corner, you can admire the Colonial towers of the 18th-century San Felipe Neri church, also known as La Profesa. But perhaps the most interesting view from this terrace is the one directly below. Madero Street constitutes one of the city’s best people-watching spots. From here, the sheer volume, chaos, and scale of one of the world’s most populated metropolitan areas is evident. Madero often plays hosts to street performers, people in mascot suits, and cosplay posing for paid pictures, all manner of salespeople and just a large number of people. All of this can be observed at leisure from the relative calm of this rooftop. The building La Esmeralda, where the Museum is based, is worthy of note as well. La Esmeralda was built in the 1890s with a design by the architects Eleuterio Méndez and J. Francisco Serrano. Originally housing the eponymous La Esmeralda jewelry, the building represent the turn-of-the-century, French-influenced style popular in Mexico during the Porfiriato period. Before housing the Estanquillo Museum, this building also played host to a bank, government offices and a nightclub. This historic architectural heritage is evident in the terrace itself, specially in its surrounding wrought-iron Art Nouveau fencing, a clear connection with the French influence of its times.  The museum is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. from Wednesday to Monday, entrance is free. The terrace can occasionally be closed due to private events, it is recommended to ask in the ground level lobby if it is accessible on the day of the visit.

Rock column formations like these are very rare, but can be seen in a few other places in the world including the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland, the Devil’s Postpile in California, and Fingal’s Cave in Scotland. Located in a section of the Alcholoya Canyon, what sets Los Prismas apart from the other similar formations are the various waterfalls that fall down their six and five-sided prismatic walls.  The prisms were first brought to international attention by renowned Prussian explorer Alexander von Humboldt, who visited and illustrated them during his tour of Mexico in 1803. Other European travelers like François Mathurin Adalbert, Johann Moritz Rugendas, William Henry Bishop and Hubert H. Bancroft would visit the site through the 19th-century. In 2007, the country’s Council for Touristic Promotion included the Prisms in their list of Thirteen Natural Wonders of Mexico.

271,Disk of Death,"Mexico City, Mexico",This strange sculpture of a menacing skull surrounded by sun rays was discovered at the foot of the Pyramid of the Sun.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/disk-of-death,"As you walk through the galleries of the Teotihuacan exhibit in Mexico’s National Museum of Anthropology, your eyes may be instantly drawn in the direction of a manifestly morbid sculpture. In front of you stands a slate disk depicting a huge grinning skull, its sightless eyes glaring malevolently while a long protruding red tongue lolls from its maw. But perhaps most strangely of all, it is surrounded by what appears at first glance to be an elaborate halo, oddly reminiscent of a Catholic saint. Although we can never know for sure what this enigmatic sculpture meant to the lost civilization of Teotihuacan, the location of its discovery was made might offer some clues as to its symbolic meaning. In 1964, during an extensive archeological excavation of Teotihuacan, the disk was dug from the area directly in front of the famous Pyramid of the Sun, (the third-largest pyramid in the world) by a team of astonished archeologists. The discovery soon made international news and the sculpture was moved to the newly inaugurated National Museum of Anthropology, which had opened that year, to be displayed to the public. Archeologists believe the sculpture’s “halo” may allude to the setting and rising of the Sun, as the change from day into night was perceived by many Mesoamerican civilizations to be a cycle of the death and rebirth of the solar system. The symbolic meaning of the skull imagery itself is more difficult to identify, but it is thought that it may allude to the ritual practice of human sacrifice or be a representation of the Teotihuacan god of death, Mictlantecuhtli. It also may be that this “disk of death” was somehow connected to human sacrifices made around the construction of the Pyramid of the Sun. Based on the presence and location of burial sites, it seems that the sacrifice of humans and animals was practiced during the construction of buildings. This occurred perhaps as offerings to appease the gods to secure both material prosperity and safety from the region’s frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.  The disk of death artifact is located in the National Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park and can be found in Room 4, which holds the Teotihuacan collection. The museum is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day except Thursdays, when it is closed to the public.

The cave is about 150 feet across, and 260 feet deep, much of which is filled with water. Many people, including many locals, join the eyeless black fish that swim in its deep, cold waters, though the proximity to municipal sewer pipes scares off some tourists. Some daring visitors have even been known to dive from a high ledge midway up the side of the cave. The Yucatán peninsula is said to have as many as 6,000 such sinkholes pocking the jungle landscape.

But step inside this research library tucked away in Mexico City’s Centro Histórico, and you’ll find the unassuming home of psychedelic frescoes depicting revolutionary scenes throughout history. The Russian-Mexican artist Vladimir Víktorovich Kibálchich Rusakov (aka Vlady) painted the 21,527 square feet (2,000 square meters) of murals that cover the walls of this former 18th-century baroque church and theater. Entitled La Revolución y los Elementos, the murals are arguably some of the most lysergic representations of revolution ever committed to art, and take the muralismo movement to a completely different dimension. Vlady began painting the chapel in the 1970s. At first, he painted a psychedelic mural of Freud and the sexual revolution, then moved into explorations of other revolutionary ideas and movements, from the musical revolution to upstarts throughout the Americas. Over the decade he worked on the mural, he painted revolutionaries at the Bastille, Jesus, and even himself. The textured details throughout are astonishing, too: Vlady once described taking a full day to paint a 20-inch (50-centimeter) section of the wall, armed with a brush bearing just four bristles.

274,Guachimontones,"Teuchitlán, Mexico",The jewel of western Mexico's archaeological legacy is this tiered circular pyramid now covered in grass.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guachimontones,"Los Guachimontones represents the largest discovered site from a culture that once flourished in the Tequila Valley region between 300 BC-900 AD/CE. The reconstructed site and accompanying Interpretive Center were created to help people learn about the lost culture. The Teuchitlan culture is known for its distinct circular, step pyramid structures (described as looking like a layer cake or bee hive) consisting of a round central altars (a style that is called “Guachimontón”) surrounded by a circular patio space, and a circular banquette on which sits four to sixteen rectangular or square platforms. The connection between the Teuchitlan culture and the larger, older Shaft-Tomb culture (500BC-400CE) is blatant.  Shaft-tombs are found directly underneath the platforms in the guachimonton structures.  Though whether the shaft-tombs came first at the structures or not is still under investigation. Excavations at other Teuchitlan sites have shown similar constructions, and that a post hole would have been located in the central altar (or sometimes central space if the altar is lacking) during rituals. Ceramic dioramas of the full guachimontons, unique to the Mesoamerican region, from shaft-tomb and guachimonton site excavations, display  pole ceremonies that the Teuchitlan community members performed all across their culture. Often they display where a leader would climb the pole as a devotional act to their god. However feasting, musical instruments, and even burials are also depicted in these dioramas. American archaeologist Dr. Phil Weigand and his wife Celia Weigand discovered the Los Guachimontones site in 1969. Dr. Weignad, through drive-by and regular archaeological survey recorded over 200 guachimontones around Western Mexico, the majority being in the Tequila Valleys area in highland Jalisco. While the connection between the Teuchitlan culture and the greater Mesoamerican pantheon is unclear, there is evidence of some old gods worship. These possible connections are being studied primarily by the Colegio de Michoacan and they run the Los Guachimontones labs. From the Guadalajara airport it is approx. one hour away by taxi (the ride is about $40/400 pesos). It is considerably longer via bus, and unless you know your way around Tequila Valley, it is not recommended as even residents of Guadalajara can end up lost.Taxis and buses will usually drop you off at the entrance to the town of Teuchitlan. There are signs pointing you in the direction of the site and interpretation center which is to the northeast of the town. The hike is long, and has some very steep inclines if you are walking. If you took a taxi you may be able to convince the driver to take you all the way up to the Interpretation Center.If you continue up from the Interpretive Center, it is another steep incline hike to the actual archaeological site. Please bring water and proper sun blocking clothes, there is not much shade on the walk up.A secondary site called Loma Alta is also available to see, but requires either a very long hike or a good sturdy truck. If you are interested in seeing it please ask one of the Interpretive Center guides.",pyramids archaeology ruins
275,Cenote Angelita,"Chumkopó, Mexico",A flooded Mexican cave that hides a river beneath the water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cenote-angelita,"The last thing most scuba divers expect to find while diving is another river underwater, but that is exactly what awaits in the depths of the flooded cave known as the Angelita Cenote. In the thick Mexican jungle just outside the ruins of the Mayan city of Tulum, a series of sinkholes and caves in the jungle lead to an amazing submerged world. One such opening is the Angelita Cenote: a wide, 200-foot deep pool that opens suddenly from the dense jungle surroundings. The cavern was created by the crumbling of porous limestone as water crept in and hollowed out the space. The gaping cavern was once even worshipped as a holy site by ancient Mayan cultures, hence its name; “cenote” being a derivation of a Mayan word meaning “sacred well”. In addition to the natural beauty of its lush jungle surroundings, the flooded Angelita cave has a unique quality: it seems that a separate river runs near the bottom of the water-filled pit. This illusion is a product of the water’s chemistry. Different portions of the water in the caverns have different levels of salinity, causing the denser water to sink to the bottom where it looks like a misty underwater river all its own. The Angelita Cenote is a popular diving spot despite its high level of scuba difficulty due both to the remote location of the entrance and the underground nature of the dive. However, adventurous spelunkers are rewarded with a one-of-a-kind view of an underwater “river”. Just don’t get swept away.  The cenote is located 17km south west of Tulum.

Today, after a midday tour of the now-archaeological complex under the blaring sun, however, you may kill for some shade. Luckily, a quick walk from the grounds is a bar and restaurant shielded from all sides: La Gruta is literally in a cave. Since 1906, visitors to the ancient city have cooled down and worked off their post-visit appetite in this little-known subterranean restaurant that’s 650 feet from the famous archaeological site. The impressive space is decorated only by its own natural features. Sun pours in through the upper reaches of the cave during daytime, while at night hundreds of candles cast a warm glow about the cool, echoey space. The menu boasts an extensive selection of pre-Hispanic specialties such as tlacoyitos (corn cakes smothered in anise-flavored green sauce), the more adventurous escamoles al epazote (ant larvae with wormseed herb), and traditional pit barbecued meats ranging from rabbit to goat and lamb. A word to the wise, however: While no tourist-trap, La Gruta’s beautiful setting is the main draw and surpasses the quality of its dinners. Fortunately, there’s no shortage of mezcal and tequila across the menu if you wanted to stop by for just a drink.  While the space does fit 700, you're best-suited with a reservation.

277,Espacio Escultórico (Sculptural Space),"Mexico City, Mexico",A series of abstract sculptures pop up from an otherworldly volcanic landscape.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/espacio-escultorico,"Near the southern edges of Mexico City’s urban sprawl, you can find the pedregales (stony grounds). These fields of volcanic stone caused by the eruptions of the Xitle volcano (which also caused the abandonment of the pre-Columbian city of Cuicuilco) are some of the most unique geological features of this massive metropolis. They are also home to many important cultural institutions built atop the former lava flows. Perhaps chief among them is the Central Campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Since its 1952 inauguration, this central campus (known locally as C.U. for Ciudad Universitaria) has had a robust history. It was the focal point of the 1968 Summer Olympics, the site of a year-long student strike from 1999 to 2000, and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007. The Espacio Escultórico (Sculpture Space) is part of the central campus and is where large, colorful, abstract sculptures decorate and enhance the natural volcanic pedregales they sit atop. The Espacio Escultórico was the brainchild of sculptor Federico Silva. It was inaugurated on April 23, 1979. The space contains six sculptures in total, in addition to one representing the park itself. “Las Serpientes del Pedregal y Ocho Conejos” (“The Snakes of the Pedregal and Eight Rabbits”) by Federico Silva are a dark series of nested triangular figures and an origami-like animal carved out of volcanic stone. “Ave Dos” (“Bird Two”) by Hersúa is an orange abstract geometrical shape. “Coatl” (Náhuatl for “snake”) by Helen Escobedo is comprised of a collection of off-set square outlines painted in shades of warm colors. “Colotl” (Náhuatl for “scorpion”) by Sebastián is a large metallic abstract interpretation of the animal, painted electric blue. “Corona del Pedregal” (“Crown of the Pedregal”) by Mathias Goeritz is a series of five long, thin, pink pentagonal pyramids. Manuel Felguérez’s “Variante de la Llave de Kepler” (“Variant of Kepler’s Key”) is a multi-colored, metallic abstract figure. The final structure represents Espacio Escultórico itself. A ring with an outside diameter of 393 feet (120 meters) topped by 74 massive stone prisms are meant to represent a pre-Columbian worldview. In the center of this ring, the undisturbed pedregal landscape can be fully appreciated.  The nearest metro station is Universidad on Line 3.

278,UNAM Central Library,"Mexico City, Mexico",This incredible college library is a visual masterpiece of mosaic art. It also looks kind of like a giant boombox.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/unam-central-library,"In general, libraries are most known for the wonders they hold inside, but the Central Library on the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) wears its most incredible feature on its facade. Covering every inch of the 10-floor building’s exterior is a colorful stone mural illustrating events from Mexico’s past, present, and imagined future. Also, it kind of looks like a giant prehistoric boombox. Originally opened in 1956, the library building is most evidently the work of artist Juan O’Gorman. Though the building’s architecture is blocky, windowless, and monolithic, the artist created colorful designs that cover the entire surface of all four sides. The designs were inspired by a quartet of historical epochs, with the north wall representing the pre-Hispanic period; the south wall, the colonial period; the east wall, the modern era; and the west wall, the university’s history. The colorful decorations turn what could have been an imposing institutional block into a vibrant attraction that’s both a piece of history and a piece of art. And again, thanks to a little block jutting up from the roof like a handle, combined with the circular depictions of the Ptolemaic and Copernican visions of the universe,  it really looks like a massive boombox built by an ancient civilization. And the decorations get even more incredible up close, as they aren’t simply painted onto the walls, but composed of designs illustrated with a variety of types of local stone, each chosen for its natural color. Amazingly, all of the reds, greens, blues, yellows, and other colors are created with naturally colored stones obtained from all over Mexico. O’Gorman chose this method because as opposed to paint and other mediums because he knew the stones wouldn’t fade away. The UNAM Central Library is an incredible building that manages to encapsulate the country’s rich history with a kind of symbolic visual poetry, writ large. It almost has to be seen to be believed.

279,Calakmul,Mexico,"A hidden treasure of an abandoned city lies deep in the jungles of Campeche, Mexico.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/calakmul,"In Mexico just 22 miles north of the border of Guatemala and in the center of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, deep in the heart of the Yucatan Peninsula, lies the massive Mayan city of Calakmul. The site was rediscovered by an American Botanist named Cyrus Lundell in 1931, who named the site Calakmul, meaning Two Adjacent Mounds. Because of its remote location and dense forestation, it remained unexplored and untouched since its abandonment 500 years earlier. Only after it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993 did work at this site begin and the importance of this city become apparent. The importance of the city is understood through numerous references found throughout the Mayan world. The city’s main rival and major thorn in its side was Tikal, Guatemala. The two duked it out for position and influence until power shifted to the north in sites like Uxmal and Chichen Itza. Not too long after, at around 900 AD, the Mayan kingdom succumbed to a mysterious collapse. Building here began in the 6th c. BC and by 250 AD most of its structures were already built. The city covers 27 sq. mi. and contains more than 7,000 structures, only a small portion of which have been excavated and restored. The jungle is very dense here, and it is possible to miss the fact that you’re about to stumble upon a pyramid until you’re standing right in front of it. In its heyday, around the 6th c. AD, it boasted a population of close to 65,000. Murals depicting everyday life were recently discovered, and their quality and preservation rival those of Bonampak. The murals are not yet open to the public but their uncovering bodes well for what lies yet uncovered. An elaborate system of canals and reservoirs was built to support its population and farming system during the dry season. These reservoirs are so soundly built that they are still being used by the archaeologists and workers at the site. Structure II, aka “The Great Pyramid,” has a base covering 5 acres and rises 174 ft. – making it both the tallest pyramid in the Yucatan and the largest structure yet discovered in the Mayan world. After a sweaty, arduous climb to the summit, the tops of many unrestored pyramids almost equal in height can be spotted, and on a clear day, the neighboring site of El Mirador (just south across the border into Guatemala) can be seen.

Most of the route is dark and narrow, until you leave the tunnel and everything is transformed. At the other end of the tunnel you’re hit with the sensation that you’ve just reached another planet. The scenery is something completely unexpected: a white desert. If it weren’t for the inescapable heat, you could mistake it for a snowy landscape. A small reddish lake and green hill surrounding the ghostly crater provoke beautiful contrasts to the white soil. This striking natural crater in Valle de Santiago, Guanajuato, carries with it a peculiar history that combines myth and reality. Locals legends say the lake waters turn red to announce and prevent disasters. The otherworldly pit has also been linked to UFO sightings, giant vegetables, and ancient rock paintings. It’s all part of the beauty and mystery of the crater. It is necessary to reach Valle de Santiago in Guanajuato and exit it in a westerly direction, towards Huanímaro.

Set along the Usumacinta River with Guatemala just on the other side, this archaic city will ignite the dullest of imaginations. The site itself is not huge, but it’s everything you could ask for; dense jungle, towering trees, incessant calls of howler monkeys and cavernous ruins ripe for exploring. The fact that this site is only accessible by boat makes getting there half the fun, and once you arrive at the boat dock, you know you’re somewhere special. After paying entry, you’re free to roam the well-preserved sculptured stone lintels and extensive hieroglyphics. There are several well preserved structures you can explore, their interiors dark and filled with an eerie silence. You might suddenly feel the urge to dash across the grassy, shaded courtyard and pretend you’re being chased by blow dart wielding, loincloth wearing tribesmen. A grueling schlep to the top of the site’s largest structure, Structure 33, will reward you with a dizzying sense of aloneness. It is possible to be the only visitor at the site at any given time, something that cannot be said of tourist saturated Chichen Itza. All adventure archaeologist fantasies aside, Yaxchilan is an impressive site. The numerous and wonderfully preserved carved lintels and stelae found here contributed greatly to the deciphering of Mayan hieroglyphs. Carved scenes depicting ritual self-sacrifice and blood-letting helped archaeologists to understand the intricacies of ancestor worship.

283,Monumento a la Revolución,"Mexico City, Mexico",Many people don't realize there’s a lot going on in—and below—the world’s tallest triumphal arch.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monumento-a-la-revolucion,"At 220 feet tall, the Monumento a la Revolución (Monument to the Revolution) is the tallest triumphal arch in the world. And while many people admire it as they explore downtown Mexico City, not everyone realizes how much is going on inside this huge monument to the Mexican Revolution. If things had gone as planned, the Monumento a la Revolución would never have been built at all, at least not in its present form. When construction began in 1906, it was not for a monument but rather for the Palacio Legislativo Federal (Federal Legislative Palace). This grand palace would have housed the various legislative bodies of the Mexican Federal Republic, but the project was abandoned in 1912 because of the Mexican Revolution. For more than two decades, the massive metal structure that served as the core of the unfinished building stood rusting in Mexico City. Until, that is, Mexican architect Carlos Obregón Santacilia came up with an interesting proposal: he would transform the structure into a monument to the heroes of the Mexican Revolution. Santacilia used the palace’s existing cupola structure as the skeleton for his monument, but fleshed it out with monumental architecture that combined Art Deco and Mexican socialist realism styles. So while the cupola itself looks very much as it did in the original designs for the building, it sits atop four massive stone arches rather than on top of a palace. And with a total height of 220 feet, it is the tallest triumphal arch in the world (the second tallest is the Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang). The Monumento a la Revolución, understandably, is now one of the most famous landmarks in Mexico City. But while thousands of people walk past it and admire it on a daily basis, not everyone knows what’s going on inside—and below—the world’s tallest triumphal arch. To start with, the monument functions as a mausoleum for some of the most famous revolutionary figures in modern Mexican history. The tombs are contained inside the bases of each of the four main pillars, and include the remains of Francisco I. Madero, Plutarco Elías Calles, Francisco “Pancho” Villa, and Lázaro Cárdenas. When the monument was extensively renovated in 2010, more elements were added. A vertigo-inducing glass elevator now runs up through the central axis of the monument, all the way up to an observation deck inside the cupola. A whole section of the original structure was also deliberately left exposed and is now open to the public via short tours, allowing visitors to marvel at the massive steel beams and trusses that hold the whole thing together. Below the monument, meanwhile, lies an exhibition space and art gallery, as well as the National Museum of the Revolution, which covers more than half a century of Mexican history from the Constitution of 1857 to the post-revolutionary government of 1920.  The Monumento a la Revolución is located on the Plaza de la República in downtown Mexico City, which sits in the heart of a triangle fomed by three main roads: the Paseo de la Reforma, Avenida de los Insurgentes, and Avenida Puente de Alvarado. Nearby transportation stops include the Plaza de la República Metrobús stop, and the subway stops at Revolución and Hidalgo. The monument is open Monday to Thursday from midday to 8 p.m.; Friday and Saturday from midday to 10 p.m.; and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. It’s recommended that you enter the monument an hour and a half before the closing time if you want to see everything.

But when a newspaper report revealed the exorbitant total cost of the project, around 1 billion pesos,  it was deemed to be far too high for a tower covered in marble and lights, and the monument instead became a symbol synonymous of Mexican corruption. After the scandalous cost was revealed, an attempt was made to redefine the work by adding a Digital Culture Center, which currently operates in the basement. The center has seven spaces dedicated to different aspects of digital art: literature, games, communication, immersion, web lab, education, and free technologies. Its mission is to exhibit only digital art, and currently does so out of separate spaces dedicated to exhibition and immersion. The most immersive is the huge white gallery in the basement that is completely illuminated by colored lights. Despite the fact that the exhibitions are interesting, the stigma of the place did not prevent several civil organizations from converting the exterior plaza into a sidewalk tribute to the political and criminal disappearances of the 2006-2012 presidential administration. On the sidewalk, small metal plates show the names and histories of some of the people who disappeared during those years. Despite its official name, it is better-known today as “La Suavicrema” after its resemblance to a local brand of cream wafer cookies. This site is undoubtedly a complex cultural space and although art critics and most of the general public consider it a horrific monument, today it is part of one of the city’s financial districts, signaling the entrance to Bosque de Chapultepec.

285,Pirámide de los Nichos (Pyramid of the Niches),"Papantla, Mexico",The singular ruins of a mysterious lost city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-niches-el-tajin,"In the humid jungles of the Mexican state of Veracruz lie the enigmatic ruins of El Tajín, an ancient city built by a mysterious lost civilization. The city of El Tajín is believed to have risen to power between 800 and 1200, in the centuries between the fall of the city of Teotihuacan and the rise of the Aztec empire. At its height, it was the most important center of the Mesoamerican northeast, and its cultural influence was felt not only in the valleys and plateaus of central Mexico but also throughout the Gulf Coast and the Mayan region. The most impressive and emblematic ruin of El Tajín is the Pyramid of the Niches. It rises 20 meters tall, with 7 stepped terraces leading to the top. Each of its four sides is covered with stacked rows of small niches formed from blocks of stone. There are 365 total, suggesting this pyramid was used as a kind of astronomical calendar to track the days of the year. The identity of the lost civilization that built this marvel has puzzled generations of historians and archeologists. It remains an enigma; however the most widely accepted theory is that El Tajín was founded by the ancestors of the Totonac and Huastec indigenous peoples who live in the area to this day. Archeologists estimate that the city once accommodated a population of between 15,000 and 20,000 people. They occupied numerous settlements that are now covered by jungle. El Tajín filled the void that was left by the fall of the Teotihuacan civilization, and become the dominant trade center of Mesoamerica. Merchants transported locally sourced commodities such as obsidian stone for making weapons, jade for decoration, and food items like vanilla, fruits, corn, and the sacred cacao bean (from which chocolate is derived). In fact, the civilization may have been the first to cultivate the orchids that produce vanilla. The city’s monopoly on trade routes and abundance of natural resources ensured its economic growth and cultural importance, but it would ultimately spell its doom. The Aztecs were steadily growing in strength after successive conquests in the valleys of central Mexico, and by the 11th century they had consolidated a formidable reputation and a power base. Due to their relative lack of natural resources, they began to look at expanding the empire into new and richer territories. It was therefore perhaps inevitable that the Aztec emperors would turn their attention to the famed fertile lands of present-day Veracruz across the mountains. The end for El Tajín came around 1200 when a marauding Aztec army of eagle and jaguar knights invaded and pillaged the area. In the aftermath of the battle, the city was completely abandoned. Fearing further attack, the population quickly surrendered to the Aztecs and became a subjugated people. The reign of the Aztecs over the dispersed descendants of El Tajín was so brutal that when the Spanish arrived on the shores of Veracruz in 1519, the Totonac and Huastec peoples joined with the conquistadors to exact revenge for their oppression. Remarkably, the ruins of El Tajín remained unknown to the colonial authorities until 1785, when a Spanish official stumbled upon the site while looking for illegal tobacco plantations that breached the Royal monopoly on the crop.  The site then became famous and was visited by many European travelers and explorers over the years, who come to marvel at its sophistication. Today, despite being considered a masterpiece of Mesoamerican architecture, El Tajín is one of the least-visited and most mysterious archaeological sites in Mexico.  To get to El Tajin you will need to take an ""ADO"" bus from Mexico city (bus terminal ""Central Norte"") to the town of Papantla. It is best to take an overnight bus as the journey is fairly long at approximately 6 hours. Once you arrive in the town you should take a registered taxi which will take around 15 minutes to reach the site and will set you back $60 pesos. Keep a look out for the performances of the famous ""Voladores de Papantla"" (flyers of Papantla) which are very impressive. If you do see one of their shows, make sure to leave a small donation. Papantla is a very good starting point if you intend to travel further into the state of Veracruz to explore its other attractions as there are plenty of buses that connect to other towns and cities.",lost cities calendars pyramids astronomy cultures and civilizations ancient archaeology ruins
286,Museo Anahuacalli,"Mexico City, Mexico",The Mexican painter Diego Rivera created this unusual museum to display his collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-anahuacalli,"Diego Rivera, the famous Mexican muralist, was also an obsessive collector of pre-Hispanic artifacts during his life, and by the time of his death he had amassed over 50,000 ancient objects. Rivera often sought artistic inspiration for his murals from these pieces, and indeed his greatest artwork often portrays scenes from pre-Hispanic history that reveal the reverence and curiosity he felt toward the past. For decades, Rivera and his wife, fellow artist Frida Kahlo, had planned to build a museum where the Mexican public could visit and contemplate their collection. Unfortunately, due to other commitments and ill health, Rivera’s dream never came to fruition during his lifetime. When he died in 1957, his daughter Ruth collaborated with the Mexican architect Juan O’Gorman in order to fulfill the artist’s wishes. The museum building itself was designed according to Mesoamerican principles of architecture and is meant to symbolize a pyramid. Several elements of the exterior are built in the Teotihuacan style, while aspects of the interior were inspired by Mayan temples and in reference to the Aztec pyramids, using a black volcanic stone common to the valley of Mexico. The overall aesthetic of this strange building is a bewildering hybrid of the ancient with the futuristic. It has an almost sinister, monolithic appearance, housed in a building that looks like a mix between an Aztec pyramid and a dystopian secret police headquarters. Though the museum is too-often overlooked by Rivera and Kahlo fans in Mexico City, its galleries showcase hundreds of interesting artifacts from all of Mesoamerica’s great civilizations, including the Zapotecs, Mayas, Aztecs, Olmecs, and Toltecs. You will also see many mosaics on the walls, based on Rivera’s original designs, that depict the gods and goddesses of the pre-Hispanic cosmovision.  The museum is open from Tuesday to Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The entrance fee is 90 pesos for general admission or 70 pesos for Mexican nationals.

287,Laguna de Bacalar (Lake of Seven Colors),"Bacalar, Mexico",At least seven hues of blue and turquoise make this freshwater lagoon unique.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laguna-de-bacalar-lake-of-seven-colors,"The crystal clear waters and white sandy bottom of this lagoon cause the water color to morph into varying shades of turquoise, blue, and deep indigo throughout the day and in different depths. These technicolor waters are home to fish, waterfowl and stromatolites, a living colony similar to coral. This 60-kilometer lagoon (which is often called a lake, but is actually a series of waterways eventually leading to the ocean) once offered passage for pirates and traders seeking their treasure in the form of precious Campeche wood. The authorities of the Spanish Viceroyalty in Mexico even built a fort to combat piracy in these waters. The Fuerte de San Felipe started construction in 1725 with a 4-side square fortress plan. Nowadays, the fort houses a museum dedicated to the history of piracy and the role of the fort itself in fighting it, as well as nighttime light shows. Atop the lagoon one can find many risen wooden walkways that have lead to it being nicknamed the “Maldives of Mexico.” On its shores, one can find several sizable cenotes — excellent swimming holes. Still, despite its location only four hours south of Cancun, tourists remain sparse.  Negotiating with a boat captain for a ride out to the “Pirate’s Canal” is another good option.  Walk along the length of the lagoon to reach several public access points with great waterfront views. Here, you can negotiate with a boat captain for a ride to one of the cenotes or out to the ""Pirate's Canal."" Keep an eye out for wading birds like the stunning roseate spoonbill. A few bucks will buy your admission to one of the ""balnearios"" (public clubs) for a swim or kayak paddle -- or a drink. Visit the ""Fuerte de San Felipe"" for an elevated view of the lagoon and a brief, pirate-centric history lesson. Due to the slow flow of water into and out of the lagoon as well as the delicate stromatolites, it is strongly recommended to only wear biodegradable suncream and other skin products when going in the water.

288,Cenote Xlacah,"Mérida, Mexico",One of the few places where you can take a dip and look at Maya ruins at the same time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cenote-xlacah,"While the majority of cenotes—water-filled sinkholes that dot the Yucatán Peninsula—are dramatically located underground, a few are at ground level. The Xlacah cenote is one such place, making it one of the few swimming holes where you can go for a dip while looking out over Maya ruins. The Xlacah cenote is located in the middle of the archaeological zone of Dzibilchaltún, and it’s believed to have been the main freshwater source for the ancient Maya inhabitants of the city. The story of Dizibilchaltún began around 500 BC when the first populations settled here, partly enticed by the presence of the cenote, which was an endless source of freshwater. The surface area of the pool is only part of a large water system that encompasses underground tunnels and a maximum depth of almost 150 feet. The ancient city reached its apex between the third and sixth centuries, and during this period many wells were dug throughout the area. Notable among the Maya architecture at the site is the presence of a Spanish open chapel. These open chapels were commonly built out of rubble taken from indigenous temples in order to establish the dominance of Christianity over the native pre-Hispanic beliefs. Dzibilchaltún’s open chapel is one of the oldest found in Mexico, dating back to 1592. Xlacah has been explored by a few diving expeditions, the first in 1956. During these explorations, archaeological vestiges such as carved bones, clay fragments, and wooden artifacts were found. It is clear from these finds that Xlacah, like many other cenotes in the Yucatán, not only served a practical role for its freshwater but was also part of the belief systems and cosmogony of the local inhabitants.  The Xlacah cenote (also spelled Xlakah) is located inside the Dzibilchaltún Archaeological Site, near Mérida. The site is open daily (except holidays) from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Access costs differ for Mexican citizens with ID (MXN $97) and foreigners (MXN $120). A population of small fish lives in the cenote. Similar to those in fish spas, they are prone to biting softly to feed on dead skin cells. To maintain the ecosystem of the cenote, it is strongly advised to only use biodegradable skin products if going for a dip.",cenotes sinkhole mayan ancient archaeology water ruins
289,Baths of Moctezuma,"Mexico City, Mexico",The ruins of the bathhouse used by the ill-fated last Aztec emperor still lie in Chapultepec Park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baths-of-moctezuma,"In the 15th century, under the reign of the second Aztec Emperor of Tenochtitlan, Moctezuma I, a series of aqueducts were built that channeled fresh water from streams for use in several baths and “temazcales” (a kind of pre-Hispanic sauna) in what is now Mexico City’s Chapultepec Park. Successions of later Aztec emperors would retire here to relax in natural surroundings, contemplate the beautifully planted gardens, and soak in the water where they no doubt pondered over matters of state and war. The Mexica were an assiduously clean people and it was a custom to bathe every day, sometimes several times. Before being defeated by Hernan Cortés, the ill-fated last Aztec emperor, Moctezuma II, is recorded by the Spanish to have bathed several times a day and even held court while doing so. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1519, the site was used by Cortés and his conquistadors for lavish and decadent parties. In the centuries that followed, rulers of Mexico, from the Spanish Viceroys to the post-independence presidents, were also to make use of the baths. During the French rule and occupation of the country in the mid 19th century, the self-styled “Emperor of Mexico,” the Austrian Maximilian I of the Habsburg dynasty and his Belgian wife, Princess Carlotta, used it as a spa. Although originally rectangular in shape, the structure has been remodeled several times over the centuries, the last time being in the late 1800s on the orders of then-dictator Porfirio Diaz. This resulted in the reconstruction of the bath to its present octagonal design, however the stones used are the same ones that were originally placed by the Aztecs. Today this archeological site is open to the public and is just one of the many unusual and interesting historical points of interest to see in Chapultepec Park.  The site is situated in the first section of Chapultepec Park. To get there, use the ""Las Flores"" entrance gate from which the baths can be reached at a short walking distance. It is free to enter and is open from Tuesday to Sunday from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m.",bath house aztec cultures and civilizations royalty colonialism parks archaeology ruins history
290,Monolith of Tlaloc,"Mexico City, Mexico",This colossal ancient sculpture of the monstrous Aztec rain god has a literally stormy history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monolith-of-tlaloc,"In Mexico City’s sprawling Chapultepec Park, alongside the Paseo de Reforma boulevard with its endless stream of traffic, stands a monolithic sculpture of the Aztec god of rain. And according to accounts both ancient and modern, this colossal stone carving has supernatural powers: When the sculpted deity arrived in Mexico City, an unseasonal thunderstorm drenched the city for days. This ancient monolith was discovered in the late-1800s in the neighboring State of Mexico on the outskirts of a town called Coatlinchan. A dry stream bed was being dug up to build an irrigation canal for crops when villagers eventually unearthed the monstrous sculpture. A succession of archeologists proceeded to study the artifact and determined it was an unfinished representation of the goggle-eyed, frog-faced Aztec god of rain and water, Tlaloc. It may have been built by the ancients to secure favorable weather conditions for crops like maize that the population survived on. Tlaloc was envisioned for the most part as a benevolent deity, but he also was believed to possess a temperamental and irascible nature. The Aztecs believed that Tlaloc withheld rain when he was upset, passive-aggressively causing droughts and famine. When the god was truly angry he would unleash deadly floods and landslides through excessive rainfall. Diseases such as leprosy and rheumatism were also linked to the wrath of the capricious water god. As such, the Aztecs both loved and worshipped Tlaloc. In order to appease the water god, it was seen as necessary to perform human sacrifice to provide energy for his sustenance and nourishment. Human sacrifice to Tlaloc was one of the most horrific aspects of Aztec religious practices, as the god was believed to specifically require the blood of children and young adults to generate the rain the civilization depended on for survival. After the sculpture’s discovery, the Tlaloc monolith remained in Coatlinchan for almost a century, until it was moved to Mexico City in 1963 to be displayed outside the newly inaugurated National Museum of Anthropology. A specially built trailer had to be constructed to transport this enormous artifact, which weighs 168 tons and stands 23 feet high, the 29 miles from Coatlinchan to Mexico City. The sculpture arrived at its new home during the dry season, during which there is typically little rain in the valley of Mexico. But upon Tlaloc’s arrival, the heaviest thunderstorm ever recorded during this time of year swept over the valley. Incessant rain poured from the sky for days in what some claimed could only be a supernatural event. Still, an estimated 25,000 people came to see the sculpture in spite of the pouring rain when it was briefly put on display in the city center. Some 50 years later, the hulking statue of the rain god still stands at that very spot, and is a must-see for anyone interested in Mexico’s pre-Hispanic past.  The monolithic sculpture is located in Chapultepec Park alongside the Paseo de Reforma near the entrance of the National Museum of Anthropology. The museum itself is also worth a visit to see more artifacts relating to Tlaloc and other Aztec and Mesoamerican gods. The museum is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day except Thursdays, when it is closed to the public.",gods aztec weather ancient archaeology sculptures
291,Palace of the Inquisition,"Mexico City, Mexico",This foreboding building was the headquarters of the terrifying Spanish Inquisition in Mexico.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palace-of-the-inquisition-mexico,"Built early in the history of the Mexican colony, in 1566, this palace was the headquarters of the Spanish Inquisition in what was then called New Spain. The Baroque building that stands today was built on the foundations of the original site in the early 18th century, but it is, of course, its sinister history that is the real attraction here. Indeed a visit to the historic center of Mexico City would be incomplete without having glimpsed this infamous edifice that once spread a reign of terror throughout the country. Here, the “enemies” of the Christian faith were brought through the imposing doors to be imprisoned and tortured. They were often sentenced to death by being hung, drawn, and quartered or burned at the stake. The jail of the palace was known as “Of Perpetuity” to the inhabitants of Mexico City, because very few of those who were imprisoned within its walls left the building alive. The groups targeted by the Inquisition included the growing community of Spanish ex converso-Jews believed to have reverted from Christianity back to Judaism; women accused of practicing “witchcraft;” and the many rebels who sought political reform or independence from Spain. Other victims targeted sporadically were a few brave scholars who proposed the separation of science from religion or who committed the “misdeed” of teaching controversial and “heretical” subjects that contradicted established religious teachings, as well as those accused of spying for the rival colonial powers of Portugal, France, Holland, and England. By the end of the 18th century, the power of colonial Spain was waning in Mexico and in 1820 after the defeat of the Spanish armies in the bloody war of independence, Mexico was declared a sovereign nation. When it was closed, the chronicles say that people left crying while saying “God is going to punish us.” Due to its dark past, the palace was extremely unpopular in post-independence Mexico and the building was subsequently abandoned and left to stand derelict for many years. No one was willing to buy the building in auctions and when it did finally sell almost two decades later, it was purchased for the minimum price possible by an archbishop. The building passed through several hands over the years that followed and was used as a lottery office, a boarding school, and a soldiers barracks before somewhat ironically becoming the National School of Medicine in the 1850s.  Today it is still used by the school and also houses a museum where you can see exhibits relating to the history of medicine in Mexico.  You can find the main portal of the former Palace of the Inquisition on the corner of the streets República de Brasil and República de Venezuela in the historic center of Mexico City. It's a large and distinctive building, so you can't miss it. There is also a large courtyard to the back. The building is now home to the Museum of Mexican Medicine.",torture prisons christianity war history religion military sacred spaces history
292,'El Vochol',"Mexico City, Mexico",A Volkswagen Beetle decorated with millions of beads connects Mexico's past and future.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-vochol,"Mexico’s Huichol people are known for their intricate beaded handicrafts. In 2010, this iconic art style was immortalized in an ambitious project that saw an entire Volkswagen Beetle converted into a monument to their signature beadwork. Setting out to bridge the traditional folk art of the Huichol (who are also known as Wixárika, or Wirrárika) with a symbol of modernity, in the form of the “Vocho,” as Beetles are known in Mexico, the project was put together by the Museo de Arte Popular  (Museum of Popular Art) in Mexico City. The Beetle was chosen because it is an important part of Mexican culture, serving as common taxis during the 20th century. The union of the words “Vocho” and “Huichol” gave the piece its name, “El Vochol.” With the help of several different agencies, two Huichol artisan families were contacted to participate in the work. In total, eight artisans applied 2,277,000 beads to the car over the course of over 4,000 hours. The finished car is covered in important historical and mythological symbols. In the back, a shaman paddles a canoe, while on other parts of the car, you can find the Sun god, the deer god, the corn god, and the fire grandfather. You can also find scorpions, peyote flowers, birds, lizards, and other animals from the native region represented in the beadwork. “El Vochol” was finished at the end of 2010, just in time for the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the start of the Mexican War of Independence, and the 100th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution (the dates are patterned in the Wixarika language on the car dashboards). Since its completion, the car has traveled to New York, Washington, Paris, and London to be exhibited, but its permanent home is in the lobby of the Museo de Arte Popular.  When not on loan, the car is displayed at the main entrance of the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. It is not necessary to access the museum to view it, as it is located in the lobby.",art museum cars objects of intrigue art museums
