0,Acacus Mountains,"Ghat, Libya",Landscape of bizarrely shaped desert mountains and innumerable rock carvings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/acacus-mountains,"Golden sand dunes cover the ground and cling to the sides of the basaltic mountain range that rises abruptly out of the flat Sahara desert. Forces of nature have always shaped this place, clearly visible in the sand that piles in every rock niche and side canyon of the mountain range, and seemingly embrace the rocks of the terrain. A millennia of desert winds and flashfloods have carved the mountains into bizarre shapes, with innumerable natural arches spanning the foot of the mountains, the largest of which reaches an astonishing height of 150 meters. But it is not the mountains, nor the scenery for which this place is known. Visitors and scientists alike flock to one of Libya’s most remote corners for the numerous pictographs that are found all over the mountains. These images are found seemingly everywhere – at the base of the mountains, under overhanging rocks, in mountain caves, and in the many canyons of the Acacus Mountains. The pictographs depict animals, hunting scenes, and social gatherings. However, they are not merely prehistoric paintings. The date of their origin can roughly be put into four different time periods. The oldest images, from the so-called Wild Fauna Period (12,000 – 6000 BC), were created when the Sahara was covered in a plentiful savannah, with Elephants and Giraffes roaming the wide plains. During this period, carvings depicting those animals were scrawled across the desert cave walls. The Round Head Period (8000 – 6000 BC), named after the images of rather formless bodies in the depictions of humans, forms a transition period between the age of Hunter-Gatherers and the creation of permanent settlements. The Pastoral Period (5500 – 2000 BC) followed, during which the climate of the Sahara grew much more arid. Human figures dominating and taming the forces of nature were painted during this period, including depictions of domesticated cattle and social festivities. Horse and chariot depictions majorly date from the Horse Period (1000 BC – AD 1), during which means of transport made a leap forward, allowing the beginning of large Trans-Continental trade routes in Africa. The final period is called the Camel Period (200 BC – present), during which the Sahara finally became the arid desert that it is today. No single culture or civilization can claim responsibility for the rock art, rather it was most likely a continued tradition among the people of the region, which was set off by the mountains’ earliest inhabitants. The cultures that followed these first settlers, the Tuareg and the Garamantes people, adapted this tradition and created their own images. Over a timespan of 14 millennia, the climate of the region has dramatically changed. Each change, altered the landscape and forced its inhabitants to adapt. The natural forces that have shaped this place are visible in the mountains. The societal changes that followed are visible in the depictions of the rock carvings. Both nature and humans created an astonishing place, in which its history can be read like a book.","Reached via 4WD from Ghat or al-Aweinat; Ghat District, Libya"
1,Ghadames,"Gadamis, Libya",A beautiful oasis town dating back to the Roman period still serves as reprieve from the brutal summer sun in Libya.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ghadames-oasis,"A tad less than 300 miles away from Tripoli there exists an ancient getaway, an oasis made of mud, lime, and the trunks of palms. Covered alleyways and heat reflecting, creme-colored walls weave in and out of grottos and lead to the old town spring water pool. This pre-Saharan city is Ghadames, also known as the ‘pearl of the desert’. While none of the buildings from the protohistoric Berber period or the time of Roman domination still stand, the architectural style distinguishes Ghadames from the surrounding pre-Saharan cities. The houses cluster into a rough circle, the outer walls facing the edges of the city creating a fortified wall around the entire settlement. Inside the walls, the houses utilize different floors for different needs, one for storing goods, another for family living, and the covered alleyways for traveling around the city protected from the blistering desert sun, creating the feel of underground passageways. At the top, open-air terraces are reserved for the women only. Considered the old part of town, new housing has been built outside of the lime-washed walls, however many of the 10,000 residents of this historic oasis return when the heat becomes unbearable, as those walls still provide more relief from the relentless heat than anywhere else.",
2,Gaberoun Oasis,Libya,A deserted Bedouin village lines the shores of this stunning desert oasis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gaberoun-oasis,"This brilliant blue-green gem of a lake, surrounded by golden sand as far as the eye can see, looks like a small pocket of island paradise hidden among the dunes of the Sahara Desert. Palm trees fringe the water, and the ruins of an abandoned village dot one corner of the shore. A Bedouin tribe once lived along the Gaberoun Oasis (also spelled Gabroon, Gabraun, and Gabr Awhn). They fished for saltwater crustaceans, little worm-like creatures that live within the lake. But they couldn’t rely on the lake itself for drinking water, the most precious desert treasure. Instead, they had to dig beneath the sand around its perimeter to search for the same underground springs that feed the trees. The government relocated the entire tribe to a newly built village in the 1980s. The ruins of their old settlement remain, left to bake beneath the scorching sun. A ramshackle tourist camp, complete with a handful of sleeping huts and a small market, keeps a sporadic trickle of human life flowing into the otherwise abandoned oasis. Those who do visit like to swim in the lake; its salinity makes it a pleasant place to float, especially since the surface is strangely chilly. The water’s temperature gets hotter the deeper you dive.",
3,Qasr al-Haj,"Qasr al Hajj, Libya","Fortress-like granary, continually in use for more than nine centuries.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qasr-al-haj,"Berber architecture is probably one of the most evocative architectural styles in the world. The simplicity of the structures merge with the harsh landscape of the Sahara desert to create a timeless beauty. Some Berber structures in neighbouring Tunisia became world-famous after George Lucas included them in his Star Wars movies. The Qasr al-Haj is arguably the most stunning piece of Berber architecture in Libya. Other than its name suggests (literally translated: Fortress of al-Haj), the structure is neither a fortress, nor a fortified village. The building is a storage facility, created to store the harvests of the semi-nomadic and partly settled people of the region. It is a circular building, featureless from the outside, with a main gate that leads to the large courtyard inside. Surrounding the courtyard are 114 cave-like storage rooms, arranged in several levels. The lowest level, which partially lies underground, is used to store olive oil, while the upper levels are mainly used for barley and wheat. At the side of the main gate, a staircase leads to the top, where a walk completes a full circle around the top of the structure. In a region of limited crops, granaries like this shelter the harvest from animals, thieves and weather extremes. The Qasr al-Haj was built in the 12th century by Sheikh Abu Jatla, who rented the storage rooms to several parties in exchange for a small amount of barley and wheat, which he then distributed among the poor. Since the building is still in use, visitors are encouraged not to enter the storage rooms without the guidance of the caretaker, or the permission from the owners. As of October 2011, it remains unclear, whether the 2011 Libyan Civil War damaged Qasr al-Haj.","Qasr al-Haj, near Zintan, Jebel al-Gharbi District, Libya"
4,Waw an Namus,Libya,"Surrounded by a smudge of dark earth, this isolated volcano sits in stark contrast to the surrounding Sahara.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/waw-an-namus,"“Seen from space, few other dormant volcanoes look as exotic and spectacular as Waw an Namus,” says NASA’s Earth Observatory. From high above, the volcano is clear to see in the Sahara. It’s surrounded by a smudge of dark basaltic ash and tephra, which extends between six and 12 miles around the central caldera in stark contrast to the surrounding desert. And inside the caldera lie three glinting lakes surrounded by flecks of green. Approaching by foot, visitors to this remote location first walk through the moonscape of the ash and tephra. At the heart of this peculiar landscape is the two-mile-wide, 330-feet-deep caldera, with a 460-feet-high post-caldera scoria cone near its center. Once at the caldera rim, a strange sight awaits: three lakes, and a few smaller bodies of water, lie on the floor of the caldera, surrounded by palms, reeds, and swamp vegetation. Much of the water within the caldera is warm and saline, but some bodies of freshwater do exist. Waw an Namus, therefore, has long been an important stop for caravans traveling across this otherwise parched and isolated part of the Sahara. But Waw an Namus isn’t the most inviting of campgrounds for one particular reason: mosquitoes, and lots of them. The name itself translates to “Crater of Mosquitos,” and visitors are well-advised to camp outside the caldera unless they are well prepared with mosquito nets and a serious supply of repellent. The mosquitoes of Waw an Namus don’t often have the chance to feed on fresh blood, so when they do, they don’t hold back. Questions remain regarding the formation of Waw an Namus. Volcanism in the Sahara isn’t fully understood and various theories exist to explain the presence of volcanoes like Waw an Namus. Its age, too, is open to debate. The central cone looks relatively young, suggesting it may have been formed as recently as a few thousand years ago. The arid climate of the region, however, may be masking the volcano’s true age.","Waw an Namus is located in the Sahara desert of south-central Libya, to the south of the Haruj volcanic field. It lies about 250 miles southeast of the oasis city of Sabha. Due to its remote location and the ongoing Libyan Civil War, few people actually visit Waw an Namus despite its reputation as one of the most beautiful and fascinating natural attractions in the country. Tours can be arranged in the larger cities, but it’s worth doing some thorough research before choosing a company."
5,Leptis Magna,"Al-Khums, Libya",Magnificent Roman ruins lie vulnerable to destruction on the edge of the Mediterranean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leptis-magna,"In what is now Libya, Leptis Magna was once the shining star of the Roman Empire. As far as ruins go, the city still stands out as a superior example of Rome’s considerable advances in urban planning and architecture. Despite existing in an unstable nation and sporadically under threat of being caught in the crossfires of civil unrest, it has survived as one of the most complete set of Roman ruins standing. Originally a Phoenician and Berber foundation, the city became part of the grandiose Roman Empire under Tiberius. Under the reign of Lucius Septimius Severus in 193, Leptis peaked as the third greatest city on the entire continent of Roman Africa. Unfortunately, like so many other Roman cities, the vibrant metropolis was doomed by its growth and ingenuity outgrowing its means, and by mid-4th century, the once glorious city by the sea was heavily abandoned, easily sacked by invaders, and in constant threat of destruction due to war and civil unrest. While the ruins still stand regally against the sky, that threat has yet to pass. As recently as 2011, civil war has found its way to Leptis Magna, a ready-made bunker,  attractive as a place to hide weapons, shield military vehicles, and keep backs to the sea. Despite being under UNESCO’s protective wing, its vulnerability to rebels has prompted NATO to make no promises that it will remain off limits from air strikes if intervention is necessary. Currently the site is quiet, and the empty city sleeps.",
6,Arch of Marcus Aurelius,"Tarabulus, Libya",This triumphal arch is the only fully standing structure that remains from Roman-era Oea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arch-of-marcus-aurelius,"In the mid-second century, the coastal town of Oea (now modern-day Tripoli in Libya) began an architectural shift to better reflect its recently acquired status as a Roman colonia. Monumental Roman-style structures were erected in what is now Tripoli’s old town, bringing a distinctly Roman identity to a settlement founded by the Phoenicians and ruled by Greeks and Carthaginians before the Romans arrived. Unlike the other two ancient cities of Roman Tripolis—Sabratha and Leptis Magna—Oea has been continuously inhabited. Over the centuries, many of its older buildings have been quarried for material or built over and destroyed, leaving scant traces of the city’s Roman past. The most notable exception is the Arch of Marcus Aurelius, a fascinating triumphal arch that would have been central to the town’s Roman identity. Thanks to a four-line inscription on the arch, we know it was built in honor of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Lucius Verus was the adoptive brother of Marcus Aurelius, and the triumphal arch was erected in large part to commemorate his recent victories over the Parthians. Completed around 165 and built almost entirely from marble, the arch has a rectangular footprint measuring about 41 feet by 32 feet. It is a quadrifrons (or tetrapylon) arch, being of cubic shape with a gate on each of the four sides. The arch was placed in a prominent position near the harbor and at the crossroads leading out to Odea’s neighboring towns. As such, new arrivals, especially important visitors, would have passed through the arch when arriving in Oea. At the time of its construction, the Arch of Marcus Aurelius would have been one of the most elaborately decorated arches in North Africa. It has been heavily eroded over the years, with some parts so damaged that the original features have been lost. But many of the most interesting features can still be identified, especially on the northwest face. Among the decorative acanthus leaves, vines, and grapes etched into the pillars are various figures, including representations of captured barbarians. Among the prisoners are a male with hands bound, a seated woman, and a young boy who seems to be crying. The most important figures, however, are those of the city’s patron deities, Apollo and Minerva. Apollo is represented in a chariot drawn by two griffins, while Minerva, bearing helmet and shield, stands in a chariot pulled by a pair of sphinxes. Four notably empty niches are also embedded within the arch. These likely once held statues of both Emperor Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Statues have been found in excavations around the fringes of the arch, one of which has been identified as Lucius Verus. In terms of size, it would have fit quite nicely inside one of the now vacant niches.","The Arch of Marcus Aurelius is located along Al Hara Alkabir Street in the Old Town of Tripoli. Tripoli is the capital and largest city of Libya, and is located in the northwest of the country. The arch can be seen at any time of day. Entrance is free."
7,Atiq Mosque,"Ajdabiya, Libya",Early Islamic mosque with several strange conical domes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atiq-mosque,"Two palm trunks mark the entrance to one of Libya’s most beautiful mosques. The whitewashed mud-brick structure dates from the 7th century, and greeted Muslim pilgrims and caravan routes that crossed this area for a centuries. During the heyday of the Sahara caravan trade routes, the oasis city of Awjilah was an important stop on the way to the Cyrenaican coast, bringing travelers from across the ancient world to the mosque. Nine doors grant access to the house of worship, which lead into a labyrinth of pillars and arches inside, covering an area of more than 400 m². However, the outside of the building is even more remarkable and features 21 snow-white conical beehive domes. The beehives dominate the skyline of the old town of Awjilah, which was lovingly restored in 2006, after the city became one of the most convenient spots to view the solar eclipse of March 2006. As of October 2011 it remains unclear whether the 2011 Libyan Civil War damaged Awjilah, or its ancient mosque.","Awjilah, al-Wahat District, Libya"
8,Wheelus Air Base,"Tripoli, Libya","70 years of foreign military influence on the shores of Tripoli, Libya.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wheelus-air-base,"Between its construction in 1923, and the end of the Cold War in 1991, Wheelus Air Base belonged to five major world powers. Following the base’s ownership neatly parallels world history’s major events, and follows the evolution of power throughout the 20th century. After invading in 1911, Italy took control of Libya as a colony, and opened the air base in 1923. During World War II, another axis power, the Nazis took over the air base as a strategic post in the Mediterranean. As the war turned, the British seized control of the base in 1943, and began a long period of Western influence in Libya. Following the war, Wheelus was handed over to the United States. America immediately jumped on the opportunity to hold a base in a location strategic to North Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Shortly after taking control, there were 5,000 air force troops deployed at the base, and Wheelus became known as “Little America.” While the Americans controlled the base, some Libyan forces were also deployed there, working side by side on their aircraft. One of these men was Muammar Gaddafi, who before instituting his own brand of strict religious rule, was a well-known playboy, who would drink and carouse with the Americans stationed at Wheelus. Unfortunately, Gaddafi’s flirtation with the west ended in 1969, when the Americans were given notice and promptly asked to leave Wheelus Air Base. Strangely enough, after finally gaining power and independence, Gaddafi invited the Soviet Union to Wheelus, where they were stationed until the end of the Cold War. Today, Wheelus Air Base is known as Mitiga International Airport, and is no longer home to any foreign army.",
9,Avenue of the Baobabs,"Morondava, Madagascar",The centuries old trees lining both sides of this dirt road may become Madagascar's first natural monument.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/avenue-of-the-baobabs,"The dirt road on the west coast of Madagascar linking Morondava and Belo Tsiribihina is framed by dozens of rare and ancient baobab trees creating a setting so beautiful and unique that it may become the country’s first official natural monument. These giant, dry season-deciduous trees (members of the Mallow family), many of which are more than 800 years old with trunks that are over 150 feet around did not always stand alone. At one time the trees dotting the lane were part of a rich forest of the trees and other plants, but the encroachment of modern civilization and increasing populations in the area led to massive deforestation leaving the remaining baobabs to stand in relative isolation. There are also a handful of the ancient trees remaining in the outlying areas but both the trees along the road otherwise are under near-constant threat of destruction. When Arab seafarers first visited a bit over 1000 years ago, they said the devil ripped them out of the ground and put them back upside down, for their canopies resemble roots. Thankfully, private organizations have taken notice of the site and are now promoting efforts to have the avenue protected, making it the country’s first nationally recognized natural monument, so that the trees might survive for another 800 years to come.  Baobabs are incredibly useful plants, their trunks are harmlessly tapped for water during the dry season and have even been lived in, the young leaves (when reachable) are eaten as a salad vegetable when little else is available, and the nutritious sour brown pulp (tasting somewhat like tamarind) of the hard-shelled fruits is made into a pleasant summertime beverage all over Africa, and is also an ingredient in a Senegalese peanut and couscous dessert pudding called Ngalakh. These trees are popular in novelty gardens around the warmer parts of the Mediterranean and sometimes show up in southern California, they are hardy to plant hardiness zone 10a (minimum of 30 to 35 F) and will not survive more than 8 to 10 hours in the snow. Another peculiar fact is that baobabs blossom, but the blooming period is very short, only about 24 hours.","Avenue of the Baobabs is often visited in a combination with Kirindy Forest Reserve. The departure point is Morondava, which offers modest hotels and restaurants."
10,The Pirate Cemetery,Madagascar,This picturesque island graveyard is the final resting place of dozens of notorious pirates.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-pirate-cemetery-analanjirofo-madagascar,"On the small island of Ile Sainte-Marie, four miles off the coast of eastern Madagascar, lie the bones of pirates who terrorized the seas during the 17th and 18th centuries. For around 100 years, Ile Sainte-Marie was the off-season home of an estimated 1,000 pirates. A recently discovered map from 1733 refers to it simply as “the island of pirates.” Situated near the East Indies trade route, the beautiful tropical island’s numerous inlets and bays made it the perfect place to hide ships. Pirates from all over the world lived in wooden huts, adorned with flags that signified which captain’s “crew” they belonged to. It was a pirate’s paradise. There were local women to satisfy their lust, and plenty of tropical fruit to satisfy their hunger. When one of the pirates died, they were buried on a scenic, palm shaded hilltop cemetery overlooking the water. Today, 30 headstones remain, including a few sketched with a skull and/or cross bones, the international symbol of piracy. Legend has it that the notorious William Kidd is buried in a large black tomb in the cemetery, sitting upright as punishment for his dastardly deeds. He was actually buried in England, but his legendary ship, the Adventure Galley (rediscovered in 2000), was left docked near the Island, and his booty is said to be buried somewhere in the surrounding sea. In fact, the prospect of undiscovered treasure, from at least half a dozen documented shipwrecks off the coast, continues to lure adventurous explorers to this very day. The pirates were off Ile Sainte-Marie by the late 1700s, when the French forcibly seized the island. It was returned to Madagascar in 1960. Today, Ile Saint-Marie is a thriving tourist destination. The crumbling cemetery, its graves half covered by tall, swaying grass, is open to the public. It is an ironically peaceful and still place, filled with the bones of violent and restless men.","Not far from Ambodifototra, overlooking the bay"
11,Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park and Nature Reserve,"Antsalova, Madagascar","Fabulous formations, weird and wonderful wildlife.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tsingy-de-bemaraha,"The word tsingy is indigenous to the Malagasy language as a description of the badlands of Madagascar. The word can be translated into English as “where one cannot walk barefoot.” The tsingys are karstic plateaus where groundwater has undercut the elevated uplands, gouging caverns and fissures into the limestone. Because of local conditions, the erosion is patterned vertically as well as horizontally. In several regions on western Madagascar, centering on this National Park and adjacent Nature Reserve, the superposition of vertical and horizontal erosion patterns has created dramatic “forests” of limestone needles. Surpassingly difficult to traverse, this landscape has created refuges within a refuge, where endemic species can be subdivided into pockets perhaps as small as a single limestone spike. Most expeditions to the area find a plant or animal previously undescribed by science. Wonders await around every corner - if your shoes haven’t been chewed away by the harsh terrain.",
12,Aven Cave,"Atsimo-Andrefana, Madagascar",This underwater cave in Madagascar is home to what is thought to be the country's largest fossil graveyard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aven-cave,"A flooded cave in Madagascar’s Tsimanampetsotsa Nature Reserve is also the home of a recently discovered underwater graveyard filled with fossils of long-extinct species, some several thousand years old. A team of scientists led by Brooklyn College professor Alfred Rosenberger has discovered remarkably well-preserved fossils of turtles, rodents, crocodiles, and the elephant bird, an extinct flightless bird similar to an ostrich. “We have a real cross-section of tiny things and big things,” Rosenberger told National Geographic. The big things in this case are the cave’s largest supplier of bones, extinct giant lemurs. These predecessors to today’s lemurs lived up to their name, with some as large as gorillas. By comparison, the lemurs we know and love now range in weight from about an ounce up to 20 pounds. These giant primates went extinct between 2,000 and 500 years ago for reasons researchers are still trying to figure out. How these bones ended up in the cave is another mystery. Rosenberger thinks that many washed up in the cave over time, before and after humans found their way to Madagascar. Aven is one of three flooded caves in the park that researchers are exploring, and it may be Madagascar’s largest fossil graveyard. When the team first began exploring, the cave was so dense with bones that “divers felt them every time they put their hands down.” The Madagascar Cave Diving Association has recently set up an underwater museum to display some of the finds, and if you are an experienced diver, you can explore this submerged wonder.","As of 11/10/17, the cave is closed to divers as more scientific research is being conducted there. Contact the Madagascar Cave Diving Association for re-opening information and diving requirements."
13,Ambalabongo Canyon,"Marovoay, Madagascar",The runoff from these fiery cliffs sends red water flowing into the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ambalabongo-canyon,"This canyon stretches across the earth like a great red scar. The sandstone’s hues are so fiery, you’d be forgiven for mistaking it for Mars or some other martian landscape. This gorgeous gorge is found in Ankarafantsika Nature Reserve, a national park in northwestern Madagascar. Unlike the rainforests of the east and spiny dry forests of the south, Ankarafantsika is more of a dry tropical forest with some savannah. Although beautiful, this canyon has witnessed dark times thanks to heavy deforestation. Losing so many trees has left the land prone to erosion, which has caused the soil to crumble and move. The erosion is to the point that the red waters running into the sea can be seen from space. The canyon is a sight to behold, yet also a reminder to value and protect the plants that hold together such a wonderful place. Inside this reserve, animals like chameleons (the largest in the world), vanga birds, and speckled butterflies are plentiful to the point of distraction. Primates like sifakas lazily lounge outside villager houses waiting for handouts while mongoose lemurs forage in pairs far above in the tree canopy.","There are various hiking trails throughout the national park.

Shielded naturally by forests, the town also erected a massive wall, and seven outer gates to protect its people. The main entrance of these seven gates guarding the town from attackers was known as Ambatomitsangana, the standing stone, and it proudly still waits in position to be used for protection. The standing stone is exactly as it sounds, a massive stone disc weighing 12 tons. As with many walled cities of the Merina Kingdom in Madagascar at the time, the gates were created out of circular discs that were pushed into position by hordes of men every night. The stone disc guarding Ambohimanga took 20 men, and was over 130 feet in circumference. Each night, these guards would roll the stone into position, blocking off the main entrance to the town. Today, the entire Ambohimanga area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is home to royal burial grounds, the queen’s pavilions and the gigantic standing stone.",

But Liwonde also has a tragic history, the evidence of which is still visible deep inside the trunk of a massive baobab tree. Although predominately Christian, many of Malawi’s citizens adhere to an amalgam of Christian and more traditional, regional beliefs. Relatively common across these practices is the idea that those who are infected with certain diseases cannot be buried, for fear that their impurities would contaminate the earth. As recently as the 1950s, one particular tribe living in Liwonde suffered an outbreak of leprosy. In order to keep the disease from spreading, individuals were rounded up and led to a giant baobab at the base of Chinguni Hill. According to park guides, the infected individuals–those still living, along with the bodies of the recently dead–were bound and forced into the tree’s hollowed-out trunk and left there for nature to take its course. The “Leper Tree,” as it has become known, remains standing today though it doubles over to one side, and its bark peels and bursts in spots. On its trunk appears a hand-painted sign that simply reads: “The grave for people who suffered from leprosy in the past.” Visitors brought to the site are told of this history and encouraged to look down into the center of the tree, where the empty sockets of human skulls plainly stare back up at the faces of the living, forcing a moment of stark contemplation in the midst of the park’s vast natural beauty.","Once inside Liwonde National park, the most prominent landmark in the park's southern area is Chinguni Hill, which is encircled by a dirt road. The tree can be found near the base of the hill."
17,Saint Michael and All Angels Church,"Blantyre, Malawi",This amateur-built East African church with mismatched towers is an architectural abnormality.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saint-michael-and-all-angels-church,"Constructed by worshippers lacking any prior architectural or building experience, this remarkable amateur-built ecclesiastical anomaly has stood out in Blantyre, Malawi, since 1891. Blantyre, Malawi’s second largest city and its capital of commerce and industry, was founded in 1876 by Scottish missionaries and named after a small town outside Glasgow, Scotland. Little remains to hint at the bustling East African city’s Scottish roots, except for this seemingly out-of-place Presbyterian Church, which is said to be “the first permanent Christian church erected between the Zambezi and the Nile.” The current building was the brainchild of Scottish missionary and architecture rookie Reverend David Clement Scott, meant to replace a much less grand Presbyterian chapel. There were no detailed plans or drawings made for the church outside of Scott’s imagination. Beginning in 1888, brickwork was simply laid dry without mortar to test for strength and aesthetics before continuing to the next layer of the 37-foot-high structure. The clay for the bricks was excavated and baked in wood kilns on site by parishioners, allowing the whole cathedral-like edifice to be erected in just three years. The laborers on the project were all local people who had no prior experience in this type of construction. Despite this, the anomalous amateur-built church, with its mismatched towers and Moorish domed bell tower, has withstood the test of time. It has been designated a national monument by the Malawian Department of Antiquities and is a symbol of and source of pride for the city of Blantyre.","Blantyre is easily reached by air or coach from the capital Lilongwe. There are regular connecting flights to Lilongwe, Addis Ababa, Nairob,i and Johannesburg for international and intercontinental connections."
18,Karonga Museum,"Karonga, Malawi","A cultural center on the shores of Lake Malawi dedicated to preserving Karonga’s past and present, including the fossilized remains of the Malawisaurus.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karonga-museum,"It’s an eight-hour drive from Malawi’s capital city Lilongwe to Karonga, a district seated on the northwest banks of Lake Malawi. Karonga encompasses a rift valley, a low-lying region where the earth’s crust pulls apart. Rifting unearths ancient sediment and rock strata, making the discovery of fossils easier, and helping to piece together Earth’s long history. In Karonga, that history includes the discovery of the geological formation known as the Dinosaur Beds, where numerous fossils dating back millions of years have been discovered in the last century. The early ancestors of mammals from the Triassic period and Jurassic-Cretaceous-era dinosaurs thrived in this region, leading to some awe-inspiring discoveries. In 1928, South African paleontologist Sidney H. Haughton unearthed the first complete fossilized remains of the Malawisaurus, a Cretaceous-period dinosaur that lived around 125 million years ago. Remains that appear to be the same dinosaur have also been found in Brazil, supporting the theory that these dinosaurs were living when the continents now known as South America and Africa were splitting apart. In the following decades, prehistoric remains continued to emerge from Karonga’s rift valley, drawing researchers and paleontologists from around the world. In 1983, two scientists established the Hominid Corridor Research project, which focused on the study of early human environments and hominid remains. These early ancestors are dated between one million and eight million years old, establishing Karonga as a contender for the coveted title of “cradle of humankind,” alongside Ethiopia and South Africa. In 2004, the Cultural & Museum Centre Karonga was officially established as a home for fossils on display, with the Malawisaurus as its pièce de résistance, and as a research facility for the Hominid Corridor project and other excavations. A cultural center and camp for schools and seminars opened 10 years later, with a display of ancient human artifacts, archeological records, and colorful murals depicting the evolution of our early ancestors. An exhibition titled “Dinosaurs to Democracy” includes the history of the slave trade, life under colonial rule, and the modern traditions of the Karonga community.","Visitors can take a bus from Lilongwe to Karonga for about $18, and should expect a ride of between 7.5 and 8 hours. If you’re staying in Blantyre, be sure to budget travel time between 11 and 12 hours. Email the museum in advance (karongamuseum@gmail.com) to confirm your visit and arrange further transport if necessary."
19,The Stone House Museum,"Livingstonia, Malawi",A history of European missionaries in Malawi.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-house-museum-livingstonia,"High up on an escarpment overlooking Lake Malawi sits the small town of Livingstonia, established by missionaries from the Free Church of Scotland in 1894. In the middle of the town is the Stone House Museum. Located in the former home of Dr. Robert Laws, who served as head of the Livingstonia Mission for more than 50 years, the museum tells of those first missionaries and of the arrival of Europeans in Malawi, then known as Nyasaland. Perhaps more interesting, however, than the contents of the museum, is the story behind a collection of white rocks lying in the overgrown grass beside the building. In February 1959, during Malawi’s struggle for independence from Britain, violence had broken out in the district of Rumphi, where Livingstonia is located. Concerned for the safety of the Europeans living in Livingstonia, the federal government made contact by dropping two unloaded gas canisters from a plane into the town. The canisters contained a message, telling the missionaries a boat would be ready to evacuate them from the nearby town of Chitimba if they felt they were in danger. The message advised that another plane would return the following day to receive an answer. The missionaries should respond by laying stones on the lawn outside Dr. Laws’ house in the shape of Roman numerals: an “I” if they felt safe and a “V” if they wished to leave. The missionaries held a meeting that afternoon during which they decided not only to stay, but also to send a clear message of peace, unity, and harmony during a time of extreme racial tension. When the plane flew over Livingstonia the following day, a collection of whitewashed stones had been laid on the lawn, spelling out “Ephesians 2 v 14” A photograph of the message taken from the plane appeared on the front cover of the Rhodesian Herald the following day and in the Manchester Guardian a few days later. Ephesians 2 v 14: “for He is our prince who has made us both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us.”","If you wish to visit the Stone House Museum the most adventurous (and, arguably, exciting!) way to reach the town is via the Gorode. The Gorode is a 20-hairpin bend road, ascending 1,000 meters from the town of Chitimba up to Livingstonia. Public transport options up the mountain include motorbikes or trucks. Where the paved road of Chitimba meets the dirt of the Gorode you will usually not have long to wait before willing drivers arrive to offer you transport."
20,Great Mud Mosque of Djenné,"Djenne, Mali",The central mosque of this Mali town is entirely built from mud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-mud-mosque-of-djenne,"Rising up at the center of Djenné, Mali, is the Great Mosque. Built in 1907, everything from its minarets to its spired walls is constructed from mud. In fact, the whole historic town of Djenné has been built from this mud architecture since the 14th century, in a tradition passed down from generation to generation. The process involves baking mud and straw bricks in the sun and stacking them to create walls that are then plastered with mud. The mosque (together with some 200 historic homes in the city) requires regular re-plastering to keep its form. Recent political upheavals and a drought have threatened the mud architecture of Djenné, and so has the emergence of more modern building materials. However, while some Mali mosques have added electricity and other technology, the citizens of Djenné are dedicated to their historic building and only a loudspeaker system has been incorporated into the structure.","The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) currently advise against traveling to some parts of Mali, therefore their website should be consulted before booking your flights. Moreover, since 1996, non-Muslims are not allowed inside the mosque."
21,Bandiagara Escarpment Cliff Dwellings,"Bandiagara, Mali",These homes carved into the mountains seem to defy the laws of nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cliff-dwellings-bandiagara-escarpment,"The Bandiagara Escarpment slices across the hot and dusty lands of the Sahel in Mali for over 100 miles. In itself, Bandiagara is a wonder of nature. The cliffs rise over 1,500 feet in the air in places and range in geographic diversity from desert to cascading waterfalls plummeting onto the plains below. However, almost more impressive than the landscape are the Dogon homes carved into the escarpment. Although a range of people lived in the area, for over 600 years the Dogon people have made Southern Mali their home, carving everything from simple rectangular homes into the cliff walls to detailed Mosque’s made out of mud and stick. The Dogon’s contribution to the region is immense. The entire concept of their village is stunning, as homes hang from the cliffs defying all natural bounds of the traditional city. Some of the villages can hardly even be seen as they blend seamlessly with the rocky cliffs that surround them. Others are only noticeable from their thatched roofs, protruding from the sand and rock. Every aspect of the Bandiagara is strongly punctuated. The escarpment itself rises dustily from the sparse Sahel vegetation below and the homes of the Dogon villages dot the cliffs for miles until the escarpment terminates at the highest peak in Mali, Hombori Tondo. There are thirty Dogon villages in total across the escarpment and a multitude of Dogon sites aside from the houses. The dramatic landscape has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1989. Much of the Dogon’s original cultural traditions still exist, including mask rituals and cave shrines. Visitors to the region can also stay directly in the Dogon villages along the escarpment, allowing for a truly unique hostel experience.","The main bases for organizing your trek are Mopti-Sévaré, Douentza or Bakass. Within the Dogon country, Bandiagara and Sanga can also be used as starting points. Most people opt by a three-day trek starting from Bandiagara. It is important to know that much of Dogon country is very rough, and you will be rock scrambling and climbing to the cliffs under intense heat. Guides are essential in the Dogon country and you can make arrangements in any of the villages mentioned above."
22,Timbuktu Manuscripts,"Timbuktu, Mali",Ancient Manuscripts showcase the civilization of West Africans during the Middle Ages.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/timbuktu-manuscripts-mali,"Hundreds of thousands of ancient manuscripts have been collected in Timbuktu, Mali, the legendary city founded as a commercial center in West Africa 900 years ago. Hidden in cellars or buried, hid between the mosque’s mud walls and safeguarded by their patrons, many of these manuscripts survived the city’s decline. They now form the collection of several libraries in Timbuktu, which hold up to 700,000 manuscripts. Some were written in the town itself, others (including exclusive copies of the Qur’an for wealthy families) were imported through the lively book trade. Timbuktu was once a flourishing center of Saharan trade, and the home of a prestigious university, l’Université de Sankoré de Tombouctou, believed to be one of the first in the world. It was known, at its peak, as a city of books. The manuscripts are written in various styles of the Arabic script and date back to as early as the 13th century. These styles were developed in Timbuktu and the surrounding regions of Mali and West Africa. Timbuktu’s fortunes came crashing down at the end of the 16th century as trade routes shifted, and by the Victorian era it had become a lonely desert outpost. The largest single collection of manuscripts in Timbuktu - about 18,000 of them - is housed at the Ahmed Baba Institute. The rest are scattered throughout the city’s many private libraries and collections (like the Imam Essayouti, Al Aquib, and Al Wangara manuscript libraries). They have suffered the ravages of time, but are at risk, particularly from Mali’s rainy season. Digital images of the manuscripts were donated by Abdel Kader Haidara, owner and director of the Mamma Haidara Commemorative Library. The Library of Congress will include additional manuscripts in the future as new digital images are received. An exhibit of items from the Mamma Haidara Commemorative Library is available at the Library of Congress. Started in 2008 as a part of UNESCO’s Memory of the World Programme and a NEPAD Cultural Project, the Timbuktu Manuscripts Project aims to catalogue and preserve the works.","Some of the manuscripts can be visited in the ""Bibliothèques familiales des Imams Essayouti"" a few years ago. In September of 2013, a suicide bombing in the vicinity of the library shuddered some basic structures, but these were restored in 2015. The British Library is now undertaking the digitization of these libraries in situ in Timbuktu, where work is underway in the Imam Essayouti library since October 2017."
23,Tomb of Askia,"Gao, Mali",The most important and best preserved remnant of West Africa's powerful Songhai Empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-askia,"The Tomb of Askia was built by Askia Muhammad, the Emperor of Songhai, in 1495. Located in Gao, a city in Mali near the banks of the River Niger, the dramatic and notably spiky-looking pyramidal tomb is part of a complex that also includes two flat-roofed mosque buildings, the mosque cemetery, and an open-air assembly ground. Askia Muhammad was a West African statesman and military leader who took the throne of the Songhai Empire in 1493. He was a highly capable ruler who introduced an efficient administrative system across the lands of his sprawling empire, one of the largest states in African history. He divided Songhai into provinces, each with its own governor, and created new positions for the directors of finance, justice, interior, agriculture, water, and more. He also built a standing army under the command of a general, and appointed an admiral to command his fleet of war canoes. Askia Muhammad was a pious man and soon established Islam as the religion of the nobles. When Gao became the official capital of the Empire, and Islam was adopted as its official religion, Muhammad ordered the construction of what is now known as the Tomb of Askia. The centerpiece of the complex is the 56-foot-tall (17 meters) pyramidal structure, today considered the finest remaining example of the monumental mud-building traditions of the Songhai Empire. The style is unique to the West African Sahel, and represents a merger of Islamic tradition and local building practices, which had to adapt to the environment. The pyramid’s dramatic “spiky” appearance is due to the permanent acacia-wood scaffolding that juts out across its surface. The tomb was constructed with wet plaster and mud, which has to be reapplied every year after the rainy season. As such, the pyramid undergoes an annual remodeling, hence the permanent scaffolding and the fluid, rounded nature of the structure’s outer surface. As for Askia Muhammad, he was eventually laid to rest and sealed inside the tomb after a family feud of epic proportions. Near the end of his reign, Muhammad was old and half blind, with no one at his side apart from his loyal friend, servant, and adviser, Ali Folen. Knowing that their father was losing his grip on the empire, Muhammad’s children began fighting among themselves. His eldest son, Musa, unseated Muhammad in 1529 during a bloodless coup and banished his father to an island in the river infested with mosquitoes and toads. From here, the blind Muhammad heard the reports of his warring sons. Musa killed a few of his own brothers and at least 25 of his cousins before his own brothers had him assassinated in 1531. It was not until 1537 that Muhammad’s son and third successor, Askia Ismaïl, recalled his father to Gao. Muhammad died a year later and was buried inside the Tomb of Askia, which is today one of the most important and venerated mosques in all of West Africa.","The Tomb of Askia is located along Avenue des Askia in the north of Gao. Gao is the capital of the Gao Region of Mali and is situated on the River Niger, about 200 miles east-southeast of Timbuktu. Gao has an international airport and is linked to other cities, including Timbuktu, by a ferry service along the Niger River. Tours of the Tomb of Askia can be arranged in Gao, but check the local political situation before you visit. Rebel forces captures Gao in 2012, followed by Islamist militias; they were expelled a year later by French military forces, but foreigners still need to be careful throughout much of Mali."
24,Djingareyber Mosque,"Timbuktu, Mali","One of Western Africa's oldest mosques, this Timbuktu icon has stood for nearly 700 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/djingareyber-mosque,"Since word of the alleged “city of gold” reached Europe in the mid-1500s, “Timbuktu” has become slang for a destination so extremely remote it’s practically unreachable—or perhaps even imaginary. Among the fabled settlement’s most famed icons is the Djingareyber Mosque, a holy structure and learning center that was built in 1327 and is still in operation today as one of the three mosques that make up the University of Timbuktu. The Djingareyber Mosque, which was built almost entirely out of mud, straw, and wood, has weathered a long succession of wars, conflicts, and political upheavals over the course of the last eight centuries. The most recent of these occurred in 2012 when militant Islamists captured the city and began terrorizing the local population. After seizing control of Timbuktu, militants quickly instituted their own draconian version of Sharia law, stoning women for failing to wear proper Islamic attire and cutting off the hands of musicians who were caught violating the totalitarian ban on all forms of music. Soon, their attention turned toward Timbuktu’s historic cultural artifacts, including its ancient Muslim shrines, which they declared forbidden by Islam. The militants destroyed the tombs of seven Muslim saints with hoes and pickaxes, two of which were at Djingareyber. The Islamists were pushed out of Timbuktu in early 2013 by French soldiers sent to liberate the city. Despite their defeat, Timbuktu remains a dangerous place to visit and, while Djingareyber and the adjacent museum that houses some of the mosque’s most cherished Islamic manuscripts, are technically open to visitors, reaching the city via commercial means has become practically impossible.","Timbuktu's once thriving and lucrative tourism industry has gone all but extinct as a result of ongoing security threats in northern Mali, rendering this famed destination off-limits for the time being."
25,Antogo Fishing Frenzy,"Koro, Mali",Annual rush for a sacred desert lake's fish stock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antogo-fishing-frenzy,"Once a year, the people of the Dogon rush the sacred Antogo Lake in Mali. In a flurry of activity, the Dogon grab at the water feverishly hoping to snatch a fish. The lake itself is a rarity in a country comprised mostly of the Sahara desert and the dry steppes of the Sahel, which undoubtedly lends to its importance and sacredness. Although the lake is sacred, it is small and murky, and within minutes the Dogon fisherman empty the lake of all its inhabitants. Throughout the year, it is illegal to fish in the lake. However, after the ban is lifted, fishermen file into the lake to grab whatever they can during the short-lived Antogo fishing frenzy. The frenzy occurs during the dry season in Mali, which allows the fish to be easily caught in the shrunken lake. The ritual is strongly based on ancestor worship, and along with other rituals in Dogon culture, women are prohibited from participating. Although women cannot join in the festivities, legend holds that a young woman discovered the lake and its miraculous fish, starting the chain of ritual fishing in the desert pool. Regardless, the Antogo festival is a spectacle like no other opening day for fishing across the world. The elders of the Dogon villages decide the date of the fishing frenzy each year but it generally falls in the dry season in the early summer months.",
26,Gaddafi Canal,"Gourma Rharous, Mali",Muammar Gaddafi's well-intentioned investment in his favorite city turned out to be a nightmare.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gaddafi-canal,"In 2006, when Muammar Gaddafi was still the dictator of Libya, he paid the city of Timbuktu in Mali a visit to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. He brought in hundreds of people to the city to pray with him in a soccer stadium after declaring himself the imam of the city. Gaddafi declared Timbuktu to be his favorite city publicly, and spoke of his great plans to use his immense wealth to shape it into the best condition it could be. He bought a crumbling and rundown hotel on the outskirts of the city and had it renovated for millions of euros. To allow the guests to travel to the hotel by boat, he also had an 8-mile (13 km) canal dug from the hotel to the river Niger south of the city. However, as a result of the Arab Spring in 2011 and the NATO led bombings of Libya, Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by rebels. Following these events, Gaddafi’s projects in Timbuktu started crumbling.  Before long, the canal was silted up and dried. As if that wasn’t enough, the canal also proved to be a death trap to locals once it flooded.  What had once been a natural shallow branch of the river Niger had been turned into a deep canal with steep, slippery sandy banks that people and animals couldn’t escape.","Most countries advise against all travel to most parts of Mali (2017), including the region and city of Timbuktu."
27,Mauritania Railway,"Choum, Mauritania",Climb atop one of the world's longest and heaviest trains for an unbelievable journey across the Sahara Desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mauritanias-iron-ore-train,"There are some train rides that you’ll never forget. Riding Mauritania’s Iron Ore Train is definitely one of those. It doesn’t matter if you’re eastbound or westbound—what matters is that this train ride truly embodies the idiom that it’s all about the journey, not the destination. First, a few facts: Operating since 1963, the iron ore train covers 437 miles (704 kilometers) on its journey across the Sahara Desert from Nouadhibou, on the coast, to Zouérat, an iron mine in the center of Mauritania. Consisting of more than 200 carriages and three or four locomotives, the train can reach over a mile (about 2.5 to three kilometers) in length and carry 17,000 tons of iron ore, making it one of the longest and heaviest trains in the world. But iron isn’t the only thing this beast of a train typically carries. Additional passenger carriages can be attached to the train, but most often, passengers sit on top of the ore. The train can carry road vehicles as well, and if you are self-driving, you have to make arrangements for your vehicle to tag along for the ride. Once your vehicle is on the train, you can decide to travel inside it, on top of the ore, or a combination of the two. Hitchhiking on this train and sitting atop a bed of iron ore is not an easy ride, but it can be the train ride of a lifetime. The train runs through one of the harshest environments on earth. It’s sun-scorched during the day and bitterly cold at night, and you’d better prepare for both, as there is no shelter on the train, unless you brought your own vehicle to hunker down in. If you’re wondering about toilets, the answer is no: there aren’t any. There is also no way to stock up on your food supplies. Along the way, you can expect to see rocks, sand, shrubs, camels, goats, and solitary ramshackle huts. Oh, and dust—lots of dust. Once your eyes get used to the dust and adjust to the environment, you can start appreciating the different shades and hues that different kinds of sand can take from a certain angle and in a certain light. Once it gets dark, you can usually see the Milky Way stretching across the night sky. Walking around along the train is allowed in the sense that no-one is checking, but it can be dangerous as there are no barriers, emergency brakes, or, in fact, safety measures of any kind. Starting off is a painfully slow affair, with carriages slamming into one another and jolting everyone in or on them. Violent jolts can reoccur unexpectedly throughout the journey. The train does not make any official stops from Nouadhibou to Choum, but the train does stop for prayers. Some passengers will get off the train to perform the ritual and get back on as soon as the train starts jolting forward.","Get to Nouadhibou, Choum, or Zouérat in advance. A train should get going within 24 hours. Ask around, especially if you want to get your vehicle on board. Pack some food and lots of water—pack more water than you think you might need. And finally, bring a blanket for the night and have a scarf or turban at hand for the whole trip. It is not clear what time the train leaves and arrives. A fair amount of waiting time should, therefore, be expected. Not counting the waiting time, it takes approximately 19 hours to cover the whole distance. Only passengers with their own vehicle usually go all the way to Zouérat, as apart from the iron ore, there is little else there. Most people hop off (or get on) at Choum, a few hours away from Mauritania’s capital Nouakchott, with a fair amount of traffic going either way on any given day. Bear in mind that there are no paved roads. These are all dirt tracks running through the desert."
28,Richat Structure,Mauritania,A geological bull's-eye visible from outer space.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/richat-structure,"In the midst of the vast, vacant Sahara desert, just outside of Ouadane, Mauritania, lies a 30-mile wide geological oddity known the Richat Structure, sometimes called the “Eye of Africa.” From space, this natural curiosity forms a distinct and unmistakable bull’s-eye that once served as a geographical landmark for early astronauts as they passed over the Sahara. Once thought to be an impact crater due to its circularity, the unusual formation is now widely believed to have been caused by the erosion of a geological dome formed by pressure from a bulb of molten magma below. The desert floor ‘blistered,’ and as the layers of rock were pushed up and fractured, millennia of weathering gradually leveled them flat again, exposing the structure’s distinctive concentric rings.",
29,The Libraries of Chinguetti,"Chinguetti, Mauritania","Five ancient libraries, little changed for centuries, preserve a medieval archive of Quranic lore and civic documents",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-libraries-of-chinguetti-chinguetti-mauritania,"Situated on the bleak Adrar plateau, the city of Chinguetti contains some of the world’s most important Quranic texts amid its simple earthen libraries. Established around 777 AD, Chinguetti became an important trading outpost on the Timbuktu caravan route to the Mediterranean. At the same time it became a gathering place for Islamic pilgrims on their way to Mecca. With the steady traffic of holy people through the city, a large, stone mosque was built and small libraries were founded to contain the growing number of religious texts left behind. Preserving the tradition of trading and passing down such holy writings, most of the original Chinguetti libraries exist in largely the same state as when they were deposited. Today there are five such libraries left in Chinguetti containing some 1,300 Quranic manuscripts, as well as civil records including contracts, bills of sale, and legal judgments. The dry desert air and dedication of generations of custodians have helped preserve the fragile parchments, often rolled inside bamboo tubes. On occasion, the crumbling texts are gingerly inspected by scholars who still visit the site to study Islamic Law. Preservationists have attempted to relocate the collections or set up restoration programs locally, but the libraries’ private owners resist. UNESCO has awarded Chinguetti and other nearby ancient settlements World Heritage status, and efforts are being made to save the city and its libraries from neglect.","Mauritania's tourism has dwindled in recent years but once you get to Atar, it's relatively easy to organize the ride to Chingeutti, where there are several tourist lodgings. Your hosts will be able to help you make a visit to the one library, which is commonly visited by tour groups."
30,Ouadane Mosque,"Ouadane, Mauritania",This remarkably well-preserved mosque stands amid an 11th-century caravansary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ouadane-mosque,"When Ouadane was founded is a matter of contention, but it’s generally agreed the city rose to prominence in the 11th century. Alongside Chinguetti, Tichitt, and Oualata, Ouadane became an important trading and religious center along one of the most important trans-Saharan routes. The walls surrounding old Ouadane suggest it was a ksar, or fortified village. Buildings in the ksar that have not already crumbled to the ground are in a precarious state of disrepair, with one notable exception: the old mosque. Built in the 15th century, the mosque received some restoration attention without detracting from its ancient charm. The structure itself is relatively small, but the uncovered rounded rows of horseshoe arches create an intriguing and at times disorienting architectural feature. Like all mosques, the old mosque in Ouadane has a minaret, but unlike most mosques, this minaret is neither tall nor narrow. With a square base of 4 or 5 meters on each side, and no higher than a two-story house, this minaret is reminiscent of a turret built for military purposes. Yet, the shape and size of this structure may be the reason why it lasted so long. The arches, yard, and minaret are all built with stones found locally, with traces of clay plastering that was applied to fortify the structure in the 19th century.",
31,Abandoned Resort,"Kaédi, Mauritania",The beehive-like buildings of this abandoned resort reside near the border of Mauritania and Senegal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-resort-kaedi,"If savannah is the transitional ecosystem between desert and forest, the city of Kaédi is located in a region where desert and savannah meet. This is the Gorgol region of southern Mauritania. Located just north of the Senegal River, this is one of the few places in Mauritania where agriculture is a possible, but it is a far cry from classifying as a fertile area. Vast arid expanses punctuated by tiny villages dominate the landscape for hundreds of kilometers along the river. One of the major settlements along this strip of land is Kaédi, a small city with a few intersecting roads stemming from the market. Of note, in 1989 a regional hospital was built in Kaédi by the renowned Italian architect Fabrizio Carola. The hospital featured domed circular structures connected by vaulted corridors that made the complex look like the product of a futuristic dream. This structure must have inspired a brave entrepreneur to build a resort in the same style a few kilometers outside of Kaédi. Surrounded by nothing but spectacular landscape, this resort was open until 2017. The family from across the road now “keep an eye” on this abandoned resort, but they can offer no information about the resort other than the date of its closure. All the red-brick domed units of the complex are connected by narrow vaulted passageways. Each unit is endowed with one or two small glassless windows that can be closed with a shutter. Each unit has a set of three-inch by four-inch glass blocks on its dome to let light in. These thick glass blocks are so effective at capturing and dispersing sunlight within the unit that they can be mistaken for spotlights. In spite of the high summer temperatures, the structure remains cool throughout the day.","The resort is fenced off, but the family across the road can show you how to get in.  There is no entry fee, but a small tip is recommended."
32,Port de Pêche,"Nouakchott, Mauritania",Thousands of colorful pirogues showcase ingenious craftsmanship at the largest fishermen port in Nouakchott.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/port-de-peche,"No matter what time of the day or what day of the week, Port de Pêche is always hectic. There are always fishing boats setting off and others returning, with the daily catch quickly unloaded and taken the market on donkey-drawn carts. But the real eye candy are the throngs of pirogues lying idle on the sand banks, one beside the other, row after row. Each part of the vessels has a unique, custom-made cut and is painted with bright colors. Drawings representing animals, people, traditional patterns, and symbols adorn the boats as well. These pirogues are built by artisans of Fula and Wolof ethnicity, originally from Senegal but well-established within this segment of Mauritanian economy. A small 10-foot-long pirogue takes about a week to build, whereas a 70-foot-long pirogue takes about a month. It’s difficult to estimate their durability, as this depends largely on how often a pirogue is used, how well it is maintained, and how good it was initially built, but 15 years seems to be the longest one can hope for. The beach in front of the market is frantic with activities. It is nothing short of a cacophony of colors, smells, and sounds. There are people refueling or waterproofing boats, mending fishing nets, or resting and chatting. Closer to the market, there are people rinsing and gutting fish. There are women selling snacks, cooking, and catching up with the latest news. Children play soccer, swim, and chase one another.","You can easily reach the port via taxi from the city center. Do not attempt to swim here, as the current can be quite strong."
33,Galerie Zeinart,"Nouakchott, Mauritania",The quaint gallery displays works by artists from all across Mauritania.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/galerie-zeinart,"Galerie Zeinart is a place where local artists can showcase their work to a large audience. The place itself is relatively small, an L-shaped room of no more than 500 square feet in total, but the quality of the art on display is impressive. At regular intervals, the place is packed with artwork by artists from all over Mauritania. Notable examples include Mamadou Anne, with his signature animals surfacing from semi-abstract works, making a powerful statement about the impact of contemporary life on the planet; Désirée Trotha, the creator of photographic chronicles of Nouakchott; or Nancy Abeiderrahmane, who captures glimpses of desert life and its subtle colors on canvas.  Interestingly, the artists whose work is on display are usually present at Zeinart, eager to talk to visitors. The gallery offers more than temporary exhibitions, as some jewelry, ornaments, masks, and other artifacts produced locally are on permanent display and available for sale. Outside the gates of Zeinart’s serene manicured garden, the bustle of Nouakchott continues, as if it were a different planet.",
34,Moroccan Western Sahara Wall,Mauritania,This fortified sand barrier dividing a contested territory is the longest minefield in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moroccan-wall-of-western-sahara,"Barbed wire, electric fences, thousands of armed soldiers, and an estimated seven million landmines run along what much of the world sees as the southern part of Morocco. But this strip of land is actually the disputed territory of Western Sahara, a swath of ungoverned desert just south of Morocco and northwest of Mauritania. This war-torn territory is divided by the Moroccan Wall, a 1,600-mile-long, 10-foot-tall fortified berm, or sand wall. At 16 times longer than the Berlin wall was, the Moroccan Wall, also known as “the Berm,” is one of the largest active military barriers. Landmines dot the length of the fortification, making it also the longest minefield in the world. The portion of land to the west of the wall, along the Atlantic Ocean, is controlled by Morocco. The eastern side is governed by the Polisario Front, a Sahrawi liberation movement. The fight for Sahrawi independence is what drove Spain, which had ruled Western Sahara for more than 90 years, out of the region in 1976. When Spain withdrew, Morocco took over the Atlantic coast and Mauritania the eastern portion, which was eventually overtaken by Sahrawi fighters. Morocco began building a wall through the territory in 1981 to keep out guerilla fighters and refugees from the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The barrier was completed in 1987, and though hostilities officially ended in 1991, the wall is still heavily guarded with radar and other surveillance equipment. Still, the Polisario Front has occasionally been able to successfully burrow under the structure. The landmines along the berm have caused many deaths and casualties among Sahrawi civilians, most of whom live in refugee camps on both sides of the wall. Since 2008, thousands of Sahrawi refugees and international human rights activists have gathered at an annual demonstration called The Thousand Column and created a human chain to protest the wall and demand its demolition. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Moroccan Wall.",
35,Old Mosque,"Chinguetti, Mauritania",An architectural relic that survived the hands of time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-mosque,"Visitors to Chinguetti have the chance to see new Chinguetti, where most accommodations are located, and old Chinguetti, the semi-abandoned, half-buried city where ancient libraries can be found. There is, however, a third Chinguetti, which has almost entirely been reclaimed by the desert. A little over one mile (two kilometers) northeast of modern Chinguetti, on the way to the village of Entkemkemt, the desert track runs through a set of unimpressive sand dunes. Buried under these sand dunes are the remains of the older Chinguetti. Chinguetti was founded in the year 777 CE and became a major trading, cultural, and religious hub in the region by the 11th-century. It was around this time that Chinguetti reached its apogee and started declining. After two centuries of steady decline, the settlement was eventually abandoned and a new Chinguetti was re-established as a fortified trading center. It is undetermined whether remains from the original Chinguetti can be found among the ruins under these dunes. The terrain is harsh, interspersed with thorny bushes, scrawny goats, and ramshackle huts. There is, however, one imposing, isolated building that stands out. It is the only building from older Chinguetti that has been kept clear of the sand: the Old Mosque. It consists of a prayer room and a minaret. The square-based minaret showcases some outstanding stonework that clearly stood the test of time. The top of the minaret is adorned with four pinnacles that are characteristic of Mauritanian religious architecture. The prayer room is dominated by four arched entryways. The building is unadorned and unattended, but it is still used by local farmers.",
36,Monument to the Battle of Oum Tounsi,Mauritania,"Initially meant to immortalize the valor of the colonizer, this monument is now a symbol of Mauritanian resistance.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-the-battle-of-oum-tounsi,"The earliest documented contact between Mauritanian and European merchants dates back to 1442, but sporadic trading certainly predates the 15th century. The year 1442 marks the moment when the Portuguese established the first permanent presence in the territory that later became Mauritania.  Although this establishment had more to do with trade than with political control, its ramifications run through the rest of Mauritanian history. Between the 15th and 19th centuries, the Spanish, Dutch, and British also established some form of trading posts in Mauritania, but it was the French that eventually claimed sovereignty over this land. In 1840, after years of trade and political alliances, France issued a decree that claimed possession of Senegal. Most of the territory identified as Senegal, however, was located in modern-day Mauritania. The part of modern-day Mauritania that France was not able to claim was the inland regions of the country. These regions were barren and plagued by the harshest weather conditions imaginable. Inevitably, only the sturdiest and most resilient people called this land home. Among these were the emirates of Trarza and Brakna united against their common enemy: France. After years of local skirmishes and full-fledged battles, the parties finally signed a treaty in which the two emirates became French protectorates. This situation persisted up to the beginning of the 20th century, when France declared ownership over all Mauritania, now considered a political entity separate from Senegal. In spite of efforts to pacify the inland regions, animosity persisted against the French. Among the episodes that punctuated this volatile situation, the Battle of Oum Tounsi (aka Umm-Tunisi) stands out. It was the year 1932, and Lieutenant Patrick de Mac Mahon was the head of a French contingent made up of French, Senegalese, and Mauritanian soldiers. Mounted on camels, they were coming from Samara, about 1,500 kilometers to the north. To travel across the desert for so long, the contingent had to do as ancient merchants did, and rely on natural springs and wells. One of these wells was in Oum Tounsi, a nondescript location about 80 kilometers north of Nouakchott. It was in Oum Tounsi that the contingent was ambushed by 120 Oulad Delim men armed with French and Spanish rifles. The battle was fierce and by the end, the land was strewn with corpses. Thirty-seven men from the French contingent died, including Lieutenant Mac Mahon. The Oulad Delim forces also lost 25 men, but managed to capture the weapons and camels from the French. Subsequently, the French authorities decided to erect a mausoleum to honor Lieutenant Mac Mahon. However, what was meant to immortalize the valor of the French colonizers, was quickly reclaimed to stand as a symbol of Mauritanian resistance against the French colonizers. Reflecting this, today the mausoleum is better known as the Monument to the Battle of Oum Tounsi. The design of this relatively small structure (about four meters tall) is dominated by Arabic architectural elements, perhaps to acknowledge the number of local soldiers that lost their lives here. If there were inscriptions on the stones at the center, they are no longer discernible due to unsightly graffiti and overexposure to the elements. Not far from the monument is the well that Lieutenant Mac Mahon and his contingent probably used on the fatal day.","The Monument to the Battle of Oum Tounsi can be seen from the main road (N1) that connects Nouakchott to Atar. There is no pathway to lead to the monument, but it is only 500 meters from the road. If you can resist exploring the sand dunes beyond the monument, it is almost impossible to get lost. There are no shops or gas stations anywhere near this site.  Expect scorching temperatures, but also be aware that nights can be surprisingly cold, depending on the season."
37,Bay of Nouadhibou Ship Graveyard,"Nouadhibou, Mauritania",The world's largest ship graveyard is the product of decades of corruption.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bay-of-nouadhibou-ship-graveyard,"The view off the coast of Mauritania’s Bay of Nouadhibou is spotted with rusting hulks in every direction, ships that were cheaper to illegally abandon in the harbor than to correctly dismantle. The city of Nouadhibou is the second largest settlement in Mauritania, but due to the limited employment opportunities, it is also somewhat poor. This economic hardship, as it often does, led to widespread corruption in the local government. Dismantling large boats is a costly procedure, and unscrupulous ship owners found that for a comparatively small bribe they could simply abandon their unwanted sea hulks in Nouadhibou’s bay. Ships were brought from all over the world to be left in the shallow waters with a particular boom during the 1980’s. Fishing trawlers, cargo vessels, and naval cruisers are just some of the varied types of boats among the over 300 rusting ships that have accumulated over the years like coral. Despite the environmental concerns of toxic oils, paints, and rust seeping into the waters of the bay, the rotting ships have produced a few surprising benefits. In addition to a continuing salvage industry that has sprung up around the wrecks, their deteriorating hulls have actually provided new habitats for fish and undersea life, giving the city’s vital fishing industry a much-needed shot in the arm. Update November 2016: With an injection of captial from the Chinese, especially in the fisheries industry, it’s said the government is committed to dealing with the hulks.","Nouadhibou is 300 miles north of Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott. Get there using a bush taxi or occasional buses, or across the border from Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara."
