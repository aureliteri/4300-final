0,Marobo Hot Springs,East Timor,No one is quite sure of the origins of these idyllic natural hot springs at an abandoned mountain resort.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marobo-hot-springs,"Marobo is an isolated village on the border between the Ermera and Bobonaro provinces in Timor-Leste. Hidden in this remote part of the world, down a bumpy, turbulent dirt road, lay hot springs and the remains of what must have once been an idyllic retreat in a lush, tropical mountain setting. Who built this resort is a matter of contention. Though a few sources claim the Japanese constructed it during World War II, many others say the Portuguese created it during their 500-year colonial stint. The truth might sit somewhere between these two views, with the Japanese renovating and perhaps expanding what the Portuguese had previously started. Who built what exactly may never be known. What is known, however, is that the local population was forcibly mobilized to undertake the construction work in what is clearly a violation of human rights. Today, the only surviving remnants of this resort are a stone building, numerous terraced falls, and the pools, all set in a lush green landscape with a great view of the surrounding mountains. The hot springs produce nearly 530 gallons of water per minute, and have the characteristic pungent stank of sulphur. They also contain a large quantity of sodium and calcium. The highest temperature of the water is approximately 120°F, and is found where the small falls are.","The roads from Maliana or from Bobonaro are paved but dangerous, with massive potholes and segments of road that have collapsed. The dirt road leading down to the hot springs is very steep and slippery. To reach this location, you need a 4x4 vehicle or a motorbike, but most of all, you need an experienced driver."
1,Uma Lulik,"Lospalos, East Timor",These sacred totem houses connect the Fatakulu people with the spirits of their ancestors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uma-lulik,"The Fataluku people of Timor-Leste (East Timor) are an ethnic minority renowned for their elegant totem houses on stilts, sacred houses called uma lulik. These holy huts symbolize a link between the past and present, the dead and the living. There are traditional uma lulik still in place throughout the indigenous villages of East Timor, as well as several replica houses built more recently to honor the tradition and to display the Fataluku people’s craftsmanship. These homes, which are built or renovated every 10 to 20 years, serve as a bond between families. The rebuilding process strengthens the ties between the past and the present and families that members are born into and those they choose. A uma lulik belongs to a specific family, but it also stands for all other descendant groups that have formed a bond with it through marriages. Ultimately, uma lulik embody the spirit of the family, its network, history, traditions, and, inevitably, its essence. The presence of the uma lulik is as a testament to the resilience of the Fataluku people. First colonized by Portugal  in the 16th century, the island was later occupied by Japan and Indonesia. The indigenous people were persecuted during Indonesia’s 25-year occupation. During this time, many of uma lulik were destroyed or fell into disrepair. In 2002, when the country gained its independence, a resurgence of traditional customs emerged and these sacred homes began appear again. Uma lulik are usually built with local timber, bamboo and twine. Yet, each and every element transcends its physical properties and is charged with symbolism. This mingling of physicality and spirituality is extended to the way each element of the uma lulik is bound together with others to form something higher than itself. The structures are a connection between past and present, those here and those who have gone.",Uma Lulik can be found in villages throughout Timor-Leste. The above coordinates are for a sacred house in the Lospalos district.
2,Lake Ira Lalaro,"Lospalos, East Timor",This crocodile-infested East Timor reservoir is also home to a spectacular half-sunken forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-ira-lalaro,"The East Timor lake known as Ira Lalaro is a gorgeous oasis surrounded by flat grassland on the northern shore and by swamps on the southern shore, but be careful not to get so enchanted that you get eaten by one of the lake’s copious crocodiles. The lake is a self-contained body of water that sits in a depression in the land. The northern shore offers great views of the lake with the mountains and lush forest in the background and the grassland is littered with water buffaloes wallowing in their swimming holes. Bucolic as this might be, it’s the swamps on the southern shore that set this lake apart from the others. The landscape provides vistas of half-drowned trees that reach back like a haunting bayou. While the lake and its surrounds are teeming with all manner of life swimming among the underwater trunks it is the massive population of Estuarine crocodiles that distinguish the lake. It is thought that over 300 of the beasts are packed into the relatively small area. One of the reasons that the animals have nearly taken over the natural landmark is that the native tribe consider the crocs to be sacred totem animals that are not to be hunted. Swamps and crocs are usually associated with the American Southeast but this lake gives the traditional bayou a run for its money. The strangely lovely landscapes of Lake Ira Lalaro may be alluring but they also pack quite the bite.","About half-way between Fuiloro and Tutuala, Ira Lalaro (a lake) can be seen in the distance from the main road on the right hand side. A few hundred metres after the lake ends (going East), a dirt road branches off from the main road on the right. Follow that road for five or six kilometres - until it plunges into the lake."
3,Escola do Reino de Haudere Ruins,East Timor,A surprisingly large and sturdy ruin on the outskirts of a remote village.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/escola-do-reino-de-haudere-ruins,"Not much is known about the once-grand abandoned building that used to house the Escola do Reino de Haudere (Portuguese for “School of the Kingdom of Haudere”), other than it was built by the Portuguese and bears witness to Timor-Leste’s colonial past. The building was one of seven schools built in the late 1920s and early 1930s in what was then the Portuguese colony of Timor, now Timor-Leste (East Timor). While others have been restored and preserved, the Escola do Reino de Haudere was severely damaged during World War II, and fell into disuse after the war. Abandoned for decades, what is left of the ruin is now overgrown with vegetation. This large and enigmatic ruin now greets travelers heading to Baguia, a remote village on the eastern slope of Matebian, the second-tallest mountain in the country. The abandoned school stands on the side of the road that leads to the village, backdropped by dramatic mountains vistas.",Escola do Reino de Haudere is located just over 1 mile (about 2 kilometers) before reaching Baguia. In the village of Baguia a formerly abandoned Portuguese fort built around 1915.
4,Venilale Tunnels,"Venilale, East Timor",These underground shelters dug by the Japanese during World War II later helped East Timor achieve its independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/venilale-tunnels,"Venilale is a sleepy town in inland East Timor known for its cool weather, comparatively speaking. In its colonial past, this town was a prime destination for Portuguese settlers wishing to escape the heat. At the outskirts of Venilale are a set of tunnels that are steeped in World War II history, from when the eastern part of Timor was controlled by Portugal, and the western part by the Dutch. In 1942, Australia deployed troops on the island as a response to the attack on Pearl Harbor. This was designed as a precautionary move, not really expecting Japan to launch a full-on attack on Timor. But East Timor was particularly vulnerable, as the Portuguese were counting on their declaration of neutrality as a deterrent against Japan. (In hindsight, this was an obvious miscalculation.) When Japan attacked, it did so with an unexpected intensity and number of troops. Those Australian and Dutch troops that managed to survive were forced to retreat to the harsh and mountainous interior of East Timor to join another renegade Australian contingent. Timorese people either joined the fighters or supported them by other means, and from here, guerrilla warfare was waged against the Japanese occupation. During the six months that it took Japan to gain control of the island, Japanese forces had to venture farther and farther inland, and Venilale became a Japanese stronghold. It was at this time that a set of tunnels was dug out to be used as shelters. The story may have ended here, but it didn’t. Fast-forward events to 1974, when the Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente (commonly referred to as FRETILIN) was founded. East Timor was still Portuguese territory, and FRETILIN was a pro-independence movement whose members were freedom fighters that adopted the guerrilla warfare approach to gain independence for East Timor. In 1975, soon after East Timor gained independence from the Portuguese, Indonesian forces invaded it, and in their struggle against the Indonesian forces, FRETILIN fighters also used the Venilale tunnels as hideouts. The tunnels that were once a reminder of a long and bloody occupation became instrumental to the achievement of the country’s independence. On a side note, Timor-Leste and East Timor are synonymous, but Timor-Leste is the name used by Timorese people. Timor means East in Tetum, the local language, and Leste means East in Portuguese. Basically, whether you use the local or the English forms, the name is still “East-East.”","Venilale is 30 km south of Baucau, the most sizeable settlement in the area. Public transport is sporadic. The best way to reach Venilale is by your own transport. The road is bumpy and many sections are not paved, but a regular car or motorbike can manage easily. The tunnels are not signed-posted, but they are hard to miss."
5,Sia Maubara,East Timor,A haunting place that is now home to thousands of birds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sia-maubara,"Sia Maubara (aka Lago Maubara) is an 8-hectare salt lake set in a natural reserve. Home to thousands of birds, Sia Maubara doubles as a bird watcher’s paradise and historical place. It is all but impossible to visit the lake without sighting Australian Pelicans and numerous other species of birds that call the reserve home. Other birds frequenting the lake include Black Cuckoo-doves, Pink-headed Imperial Pigeons, Jonquil Parrots, Streak-breasted Honeyeaters, and Flame-breasted Sunbirds. Beyond bird watching, Sia Maubara has a tragic history. During the Timor-Leste war for independence, pro-Indonesia elements (including Indonesian soldiers) murdered up to 200 Timorese people in what became known as the Liquiçá Church Massacre. It was said that one way in which the bodies were disposed of was to sink them in Sia Maubara.  The suspicion was eventually confirmed when Australian Marine Divers recovered corpses of twelve victims from Sia Maubara. Despite its violent past, Sia Maubara is a place of unsettling beauty where bright blue water and soil cracked by the heat meet. Dead trees bleached by the sun are scattered along the shore, giving the lake an eerie ambiance that is reminiscent of the lake’s macabre past. Adding to the unease, you may not be the only visitor, as crocodiles may be visiting the lake too.","Coming from Liquiçá, Sia Maubara is located 3 km from Maubara Village. It is clearly visible from the main road."
6,Rock Art at Nino Konis Santana National Park,East Timor,Ancient images hide within the park's caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rock-art-at-nino-konis-santana-national-park,"Rock art found at Nino Konis Santana National Park consists of paintings created using different colors, but with some rare exceptions, only those drawn in black or dark brown are visible to the naked eye. Among the motifs portrayed in these caves are boats, animals, birds, people, the Sun, stars, geometric patterns, and figures featuring a mixture of human and animal traits. The first caves within the park were explored and studied in 1966. The last nine caves were explored and studied for the first time in 2000. Considering the thick vegetation and rugged terrain, it would not be unfathomable to speculate that more rock art is yet to be found. Carbon dating tests run on human-made findings from the Lene Hara cave show that humans have been living in this region for at least 30,000 years. The dating of the paintings, however, has proven to be more controversial. Some scholars initially claimed that the paintings date back to the Neolithic Age (about 12,000 years ago), but this view has been challenged by more recent research that suggests these images are from as recent as 2,500 years ago. These rock paintings exhibit techniques, styles, and motifs also present on other islands in the South Pacific, including Australia. Techniques and styles can travel a long way, adapting to specific and diverse cultural contexts. Yet, the similarities in motifs suggest that in spite of the significant distance among them, these islands may have shared the same symbolic system. If this is the case, these societies must have had more interchanges with one another than previously thought.","The rock art sites are located on the island's easternmost tip, within the boundaries of Nino Konis Santana National Park. Some can be found near the dirt track leading from Tutuala to Waloo beach, while others are located deeper in the forest. The most commonly known of these sites are Ile Kere Kere, Lene Hara, and Jerimalai. For the caves near Tutuala, you can ask people for directions. They are near the dirt track to Waloo beach, and the path leading to these sites is clear. For caves deeper in the forest, you need to hire a guide."
7,Cristo Rei,"Dili, East Timor",This giant Christ statue was a failed attempt by Indonesia to dissuade East Timor from demanding independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cristo-rei,"East Timor is the one of the most Christian countries in the world, with 99.1% of the population subscribing to the faith. Meanwhile its neighbor next door, Indonesia, is the most populous Muslim country on Earth. While this religious intermingling has caused a few incidences of violence over the years, it also begat a compassionate yet awkward gift exchange. This 89-foot statue of Cristo Rei was constructed in 1996 as a present from Indonesia to East Timor. Indonesian President Suharto wanted to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Indonesia invasion and annexation of East Timor by half-apologizing to the East Timorese people for Indonesia’s decades of occupation. To please the Catholic majority, Suharto, a Muslim, built a giant statue of Jesus standing atop a globe, accessible by a 590-step staircase. The statue was built in the Indonesian city of Bandung, where nearly all of the workers carving the face of Jesus into copper were Muslim. Despite three months of construction and a cost of 5 billion rupiah ($559,000), the Indonesian government failed to appease the majority of East Timorese people. Part of the reasoning for this is that Suharto angled the statue to be facing the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, which caused controversy among the Timorese. The ploy had little effect on staving off the East Timorese independence movement, which the people voted overwhelmingly for in 1999 and ultimately won in 2002. But, like its counterpart in Rio De Janeiro, the Christ statue in Dili still stands.",
8,Portuguese Fort Ruins,"Cova-Lima, East Timor",The remains of a former colonial fort on a stretch of beach that is occasionally visited by crocodiles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/portuguese-fort-ruins,"In the 16th century, the Portuguese started trading with East Timor, and by the end of the century, East Timor had become a Portuguese colony. The Dutch and the British managed to take power for short spells of time in subsequent centuries, but the Portuguese managed to win the colony back. It was not until 1975 that East Timor became independent. After two decades of violent struggle with neighboring Indonesia, East Timor finally formalized its status as an independent country in 2002. In effect, the Portuguese ruled over East Timor for about 500 years, and they mainly relied on Indigenous semi-autonomous governance. They did, however, build a number of military forts for the protection of the territory. Several forts were built throughout East Timor, but very few remains can be found, partly due to the fact that they were usually built with locally found rocks neatly arranged to form a wall and held together by a mineral adhesive that eventually lost its binding properties. One of the most scenic of these forts is in the Southern village of Suai Loro, which also used to serve as the administrative headquarters and prison. Located along the beach, the few walls remaining of this structure are now being reclaimed by a banyan tree. There is no guardian, and no entry fee, but do keep an eye out for crocodiles. It is unlikely you will encounter one, but if you do, be mindful that they are particularly dangerous all along the south coast of East Timor.",
9,Balibó Fort,"Balibo, East Timor","A colonial-era fort with panoramic views across the East Timor-West Timor border, now home to a hotel.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balibo-fort,"Sitting atop a hill at a commanding height above its surrounds, facing out to the Savu Sea to the north and across the Indonesian border to the west, in years past the Balibó Fort was a vital strategic holding for Portuguese colonists. The Balibo Trust estimates the fort to be 350-370 years old, and it is believed to be the second-oldest such fort in East Timor. According to the trust’s website, the fort was built by the Portuguese, who wanted to protect their colony of Batugade. Balibó’s height and its location at a crossroads of travel routes made it an ideal strategic location for a defensive structure. Today, the former fort is home to a modern, heritage-influenced hotel, and a café and restaurant with panoramic views from the mountains to the ocean. The Balibo Fort Hotel forms part of the social enterprising overseen by the Balibo Trust, which established the nearby Balibo Dental Clinic and Community Centre, and has made substantial contributions to local schooling infrastructure.",
10,Quarry Bay 'Monster Building',Hong Kong,This hulking behemoth is actually five interconnected towers built in the 1960s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quarry-bay-monster-building,"There’s a reason Hong Kong earned a reputation as a concrete jungle. Both people and skyscrapers pack its busy streets. One behemoth building in particular offers an astounding visual of its immense population. Its individual units are stacked one on top of the other and create a colorful, cohesive tapestry of homes. Quarry Bay is a densely packed neighborhood in Eastern Hong Kong, with more and more industrial and residential spaces opening each year, but perhaps no building is quite as condensed as the “Monster Building.” The Monster Building, as it’s been nicknamed by locals, isn’t actually a single building, but an E-shaped complex composed of five connecting structures: Oceanic Mansion, Fook Cheong Building, Montane Mansion, Yick Cheong Building, and Yick Fat Building. They were built during a population boom in the 1960s to offer government-subsidized housing for low-income residents. The compound has a similar look to other subsidized housing built in the same decade, when the upper floors of the building were used as residences and the lower floors were used for shops selling tea, fish, and other groceries and household goods. Because of its photo-friendly symmetry and aesthetically striking architecture, the building has become a favorite spot for urban explorers and Instagrammers. The area has been used as a set in multiple films, including Ghost in the Shell and Transformers. With the growth of popularity, photographing the building has become more challenging due to a ban on public access to the inner courtyard.",Take exit A at Quarry Bay MTR Station and walk along King’s Road toward Tai Koo. Remember that this is a private residential area. People live in these apartments and you're a stranger in their yard.
11,Un Chau Estate Flower Tunnel,"Kowloon, Hong Kong","In Hong Kong, a fairytale flower tunnel is hidden within the gardens of a public housing complex.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/un-chau-estate-flower-tunnel,"Every spring, a magical flower tunnel blossoms within an easily over-looked public housing complex. It’s a fleeting, hidden gem concealed among the crowded buildings of Hong Kong. Like a secret garden, the tunnel is covered in vibrant Bougainvillea. Come Spring, the tunnel blooms with a ceiling of pink leaves and tiny white flowers growing along the vines that snake over the walkway. The effect is absolutely enchanting. Walking through the tunnel is like entering a secluded, floral oasis worthy of a fairytale. It instantly makes you feel as though you’ve left the bustle of the city behind and entered a veritable wonderland of nature. The flowers only show up during the Spring, between March and April, adding an extra sense of ephemeral wonder to the experience. The flower tunnel is part of the Housing Department’s plan to add more green spaces to public housing developments throughout Hong Kong. These fleeting springtime wonders, as well as the year-round pockets of greenery, are meant to provide relaxation and also help reduce heat and pollution in the city.","Getting to Un Chau Estate is easy. Take exit C2 at the Cheung Sha Wan MTR station, and you'll get out directly at the Un Chau Estate. The flower tunnel is right at the estate’s entrance, and can't be missed. Travelers should note that the flower tunnel is a popular destination with photographers so it's advised to go early and skip the crowds."
12,Chungking Mansions,Hong Kong,"Teeming with illegal goods and services, this towering maze of vice is also a popular tourist accommodation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chungking-mansions,"The Chungking Mansions are an infamous melting pot of seedy underground activities and vices nestled into one of Hong Kong’s busiest areas. The sprawling building is composed of five residential towers built in 1961 in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. Aside from headquartering illicit prostitution rings and drug traders, the building’s labyrinthine structure and minimal upkeep have led to a reputation for the cheapest accommodations in Hong Kong, giving the twisting building a legendary status among fearless backpackers. While the 17-floor towers have nearly 2,000 guest-rooms housing nearly 4,000 people nightly, the “Chungking Express” mall on the first two floors remains the main attraction for passerby. After undergoing a massive facelift in the early 2000s, the mall reopened in 2004 with more than 500 stores and restaurants. From curry restaurants to African bistros to black market phone smugglers, the ground floor is a non-stop carnival of shopping and scheming. Despite the recent overhaul of the mall, the building’s residential towers maintain their reputation as a dangerous fire trap due to unsanitary conditions, antique electrical wiring, and blocked stairwells. Even with all of the activities that would rather not be in the spotlight, the building gained a foothold in popular culture via the 1994 drama film Chungking Express and has intrigued academics since the 2011 publication of the book, Ghetto at the Center of the World. Chinese University of Hong Kong anthropology professor Gordon Mathews published the book after spending more than 4 years in the Mansions documenting its residents and operations. Mathews estimated more than 120 different nationalities pass through the Mansions each year along with up to 20% of the active cell phones in sub-Saharan Africa having passed also through the building. All of the academic and high-art representations aside, the most accurate description of the Chungking Mansions comes from The Economist’s 2011 analogy which equated the towering den of vice to the Mos Eisley Cantina, the fictional intergalactic pirate haunt from Star Wars. Apparently in space, people can hear you scheme.",
13,Kowloon Walled City Park,Hong Kong,"Remnants of the most densely packed city in world history, that thrived on anarchy for 30 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kowloon-walled-city-park,"At its peak, Kowloon had a population density of 3,300,000 people per square mile. Occupying every inch of hundreds of mid-rise buildings, Kowloon was such a lawless maze of alleyways and secret staircases, that police from the outside world would rarely venture in without a sizable group. There were two main alleys on the ground as well, but they did not get any natural light, instead the city had neon lights that were working 24 hours a day. When it was first built, Kowloon was a military base with walls 13 feet high and 15 feet thick. During the 19th and early 20th century, it traded hands a number of times until after World War II when the Chinese made an attempt to reclaim their rights to the city. Before they could get control, an influx of immigrants occupied Kowloon, making its regulation and governance impossible by the Chinese authorities, as well as the British administration in Hong Kong. Over the next 50 years, Kowloon grew at an enormous rate, swelling the 6.5 acre site to an overpopulated box of anarchy. As more immigrants moved into the city, ten-storey buildings were erected across most of the city, effectively blocking out the sunlight in the alleyways below. Kowloon was so dense and so tightly packed with buildings that one could go across the city North to South on a series of interconnected stairways and paths without touching the ground. As Kowloon became more of a hazardous maze, outside authority in the area dwindled and Triad gangs moved into position. During the late 1950s and 1960s, drugs, prostitution and gang influence reached an apex, and Hong Kong police found themselves unable to gain control over the city-state. In 1973, an attempt to clean up the area resulted in the seizure of 4,000 pounds of drugs, or 1/10 of a pound of illegal substances per person. The city was also home to many small businesses that functioned without licenses, namely 87 dentists, 150 small shops and over 60 doctors. After years of lawlessness, the decrepit city was slated for demolition in 1987, and 6 years later when the eviction process ended, the city was razed. Despite losing most of the remnants of the old city, the southern gate and administrative Yamen building remained intact. Today, Kowloon is a city park, and visitors can stroll the same ground that once held opium dens, triad bars and thousands of people.",
14,A Sky Full of Gods and Buddhas,Hong Kong,Thousands of abandoned statues of deities are taken to this hillside in southern Hong Kong.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/a-sky-full-of-gods-and-buddhas,"At the bottom of the stairs in Waterfall Bay Park in the southern part of the Wah Fu district of Hong Kong is a hillside where people bring household deities they can no longer keep. Wong Wing-pong looks after this collection of statues, their self-appointed caretaker for nearly two decades in his retirement. The octogenarian was once a butcher, but now every day he comes to the rocky slope full of statues of Buddha and gods from many religions, though mostly Buddhism and Taoism, where he sweeps away leaves and burns incense as an offering. Wong first came upon this spot on a walk, at a time when it already had around a dozen statues. Since then, he has regularly added to the collection, which has come to be known locally as “a sky full of gods and Buddhas.” In Hong Kong, it is against the beliefs of most residents to dispose of a statue of Buddha or a deity, even if it is broken, so they leave them by the side of the road for someone else either to take or to worship. Wong picks up discarded statues he finds, fixes them if they need fixing, and brings them to this spot. It has become so well known that he doesn’t have to do that as much anymore because people bring their statues directly to him. All of the statues look out to sea. People often visit the collection, which now numbers in the thousands, to worship, whether they have statues that have been incorporated into it or not. This is not the only such shrine around Hong Kong, but it is by far the biggest. The only thing the local government asks is that the statues not block footpaths.",

Although its size is average compared to some of the world’s most massive Buddhas, the Tian Tan Buddha holds the distinction of being the largest seated bronze Buddha in the world. Ignoring its size completely, the statue seems more impressive due to its location, in a valley surrounded by densely forested peaks. At 112 feet (34 meters) high, the Buddha can even be seen through the mountains from nearby Macau on a clear day. With eyes closed and right hand raised, the Buddha’s calm and wise appearance seems to control the energy of the valley. The Buddha was constructed between 1990-1993. Adventure-seekers climb the 268 steps to the Buddha’s feet, but the monastery does not discriminate; a ramped path makes the trip up to Buddha’s pedestal accessible for families and the handicapped. The path to the Big Buddha is lined on both sides by the Twelve Divine Generals, each of them symbolizing a different animal from the Chinese Zodiac. Every General is armed with a specific weapon and represents two hours of the day, thus, together they add up to 24 hours. Although access to the site is free, entrance to the Buddha costs money. The inside of the Buddha allegedly holds the cremated remains of the Buddha inside a relic, but even a quick view is going to cost you.",Take the Ngong Ping 360 cable car.

Its continued survival can be partly attributed to the famed Wishing Trees, located in Tin Hau Temple, which is said to grant any wish that can get caught in their branches. Tin Hau Temple dates back to the late 1700s when it was constructed during the Qing dynasty. One of the nearby trees, a camphor, was said to be able to grant wishes. Thus was the tradition started that has drawn locals and visitors to the supposedly enchanted plants for hundreds of years. Initially, visitors would write their desires on small joss paper scrolls (a parchment specifically used for offerings) and then tie them onto branches or throw them into the tree. The higher the wish got stuck, the better chance it had to come true—but if it fell out, it was not to be. In more modern times, this practice has been transferred to a 200-year old banyan tree. When a couple of large branches, weighed down by too many wishes, broke off and actually injured bystanders, the local government stepped in and outlawed the placing of wishes on the tree. To provide an outlet for everyone’s desire for wish fulfillment, a wooden rack was constructed near the original tree and a whole other fake plastic wishing tree was even built. In 2008, a smaller banyan was planted a few meters from the original banyan version of the tree so that the growing wish tree line would not die out—although casting wishes into the new tree are also outlawed. Most people now make their wishes on the colorful plastic tree in Lam Tsuen, although the wish-granting efficacy of this replacement is not known.",

At his height of infamy he is said to have commanded a fearsome pirate fleet of 600 ships and a veritable pirate army of 20,000 men. Then, in 1810 his career took an unexpected turn when he surrendered to the government and accepted a post as navy colonel and an assignment far from his home waters off Hong Kong, patrolling instead the coast of Taiwan.

19,Central-Mid-Levels Escalators,Hong Kong,The world's longest outdoor covered escalator system transports commuters through Hong Kong's hilly terrain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-mid-levels-escalators,"For most city-dwellers, the daily commute is characterized by congested streets, packed subway cars, or perilous bike rides. But for many commuters traveling between Hong Kong’s Central and Mid-levels districts, the trip to and from work can be as easy as standing in place and holding the handrail while roughly a mile’s worth of covered escalators and moving sidewalks moves them through the surrounding hills. Plans for the Central-Mid-Levels escalator system were proposed in 1987 as a means of transporting a growing population through the island’s challenging slopes. Prior to the project’s completion in 1993, commuters were obliged to take a circuitous route consisting of several miles of zigzagging roads in order to travel between the two districts. The Central-Mid-Levels escalators introduced a pedestrian option that was much more direct. It takes roughly 20 minutes to cover the entire length of the network, which at times weaves its way through residential blocks as well as more commercial areas. Most commuters shorten the trip by walking some or all of the way while the escalators are in motion. The escalators also provide a free, leisurely option for tourists looking to explore the area. Numerous entrances offer ample opportunities to enter and exit in order to investigate nearby restaurants, markets, and shops. Visitors should keep in mind that the system runs in one direction only — downhill during the morning rush hour and uphill from 10:30 am to midnight. A stairwell runs alongside the elevators, providing pedestrian access for those traveling in the opposite direction.",
20,Wong Tai Sin Temple,Hong Kong,"Taoism, Buddhist and Confucianism are all represented in this temple that claims to answer anyone's wishes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wong-tai-sin-temple,"Wong Tai Sin Temple is known for answering prayers and wishes with the practice of Kau Cim, a form of fortune telling that originated in China. The beautifully ornamented temple is dedicated to the Taoist deity, Wong Tai Sin, a shepherd boy born in Zhejiang Province on the eastern coast of mainland China in the 4th century. According to legend he began practising Taoism at the age of 15 after meeting an immortal on Heng Shan (Red Pine Hill) in his hometown. The saintly person taught him the art of refining cinnabar into a medicine believed to cure all illnesses. After spending 40 years in seclusion learning this art, he achieved enlightenment and became immortal. Legend holds that Wong Tai Sin could punish the evil, heal the wounded, rescue the dying, see the future, and make wishes come true. Originally a private shrine for Taoists, in 1934 the Wong Tai Sin temple was opened to the public for the Lunar New Year. The temple survived the wide destruction of Hong Kong during the Japanese Occupation in WWII, which was attributed to Wong Tai Sin’s powers. In 1956, with government approval, the shrine was opened to the public year-round. The huge shrine includes many halls and altars, and though it is primarily a Taoist temple, the shrine also has Buddhist and Confucian worshipping halls. A portrait of Wong Tai Sin stands in the middle of the Main Altar backdropped by wooden sculptures that depict the story of how Wong Tai Sin became a deity. Taoist as well as Buddhist and Confucian scriptures and images are engraved on the walls. The large open space in front of the Main Altar is the main worshipping place. Here worshippers hold bundles of burning incense and bow to Wong Tai Sin three times and then shake fortune sticks until one falls out. The stick is exchanged for a piece of paper with the corresponding number for interpretation by the fortune tellers. The secondary platform contains bronze statues of the 12 Zodiac Animals. Another interesting feature are the five buildings and structures, arranged in a row, representing the five elements in fung shui: the Bronze Pavilion (metal); the Archives Hall (wood); the Yuk Yik Fountain (water); the Yue Hung Shrine (fire), where the Buddha of the Lighting Lamp is worshipped; and the Earth Wall (earth). Located at the rear of the complex is Good Wish Garden, Chinese-style garden which features a miniature replica of the Summer Palace in Beijing, the replica of the Nine Dragon mural in Pei Hai Park in the Forbidden City in Beijing, and a white jade statue of sheep, depicting the miracle of Wong Tai Sin transforming piles of white boulders into sheep.",
21,Noonday Gun,Hong Kong,"This naval gun is fired every day at noon, an odd timekeeping tradition the origin of which is local legend.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/noonday-gun,"Situated on a small enclosed site in the waterfront district of Causeway Bay, the Noonday Gun is a Hotchkiss three-pound artillery piece that is ceremonially fired every day at (appropriately enough) noon on the dot. While this practice is somewhat charming in its own right, the details behind the practice—such as the owner of the gun, and the purported genesis of the tradition—provide striking insight into Hong Kong’s British colonial history. The gun is owned by Jardine Matheson, a massive British conglomerate that was one of the first trading houses, or “hongs,” in Hong Kong. The land that is now Causeway Bay was bought by Jardine Matheson in 1841, and was in fact the first piece of Hong Kong sold at public auction by the eager new colonial government. With its roots in Imperial China, Jardine Matheson was involved in shipping tea and cotton, but also made a great deal of money from the illegal opium trade. They built the company’s main offices and warehouses—known locally as godowns—on the newly acquired plot. The Noonday Gun has its roots in a 21-pound gun that Jardine Matheson set up on the waterfront of their commercial fiefdom. According to the commonly related story, the company’s private militia would fire the gun in salute whenever the head of the company (or, in some versions, whenever one of the company’s ships) sailed into or out of the harbor. In 1860, a senior officer of the Royal Navy, new to town and unfamiliar with the practice, found this offensive, as typically only government dignitaries or military officers receive such treatment. As a reprimand, Jardine Matheson was ordered to henceforth fire the gun every day at noon, providing a service in the form of a public time signal. The probable kernel of truth in this story is the gun’s role as a public time signal. This was a common practice in many harbors in the 19th century, allowing all ships within auditory range to correctly calibrate their onboard clocks, which they used on voyages to calculate longitude. Thus, the Noonday Gun is most likely a practical measure that became so common to daily harbor life that it morphed over time into local tradition. The original gun was dismantled by the occupying Japanese Imperial Army in 1941. A new gun was donated by the Royal Navy after Hong Kong  was liberated in 1945; this gun (humorously enough) received noise complaints, and was replaced by the current, smaller gun in 1947. This gun has a history of its own, having seen action in the Battle of Jutland during the First World War. The Noonday Gun was immortalised in the popular (and cartoonishly racist) song “Mad Dogs and Englishmen” written by Noel Coward. The song was first performed by Beatrice Lillie in a musical revue called The Third Little Show at the Music Box Theatre in New York, on June 1, 1931. In 1968, Coward visited Hong Kong and was allowed to fire the gun that he made famous with the lines, “In Hong Kong, they strike a gong, and fire off a Noonday Gun / To reprimand each inmate who’s in late,” going on to observe, “But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun!”",
22,"Noah's Ark, Hong Kong",Hong Kong,A biblically accurate ark located beneath a Hong Kong bridge is fun for the whole Christian family.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/noah-s-ark-hong-kong,"Nestled underneath Hong Kong’s Tsing Ma Bridge is a gigantic full-size replica of Noah’s Ark, the famed biblical ship that rescued pairs of living animals from a global flood. During the late 1990s, the Hong Kong government planned to construct a sprawling suspension bridge connecting the bustling city to a new airport across the Rambler Channel. Complicating matters, however, was an undeveloped island which would be roofed by the new bridge. Miraculously, a unique three-way partnership between the Hong Kong government, a pair of billionaire developer brothers, and a group of Christian organizations emerged with a plan to cover the island with a “remarkable” theme park. The proposed visions for this theme park ranged from the outrageous to the unreasonable before government officials received a design for a massive ark overlooking the water, a design which was scrawled by an eight-year-old Hong Kong girl. The recreated Noah’s Ark was built precisely to the biblical dimensions with a length of 300 cubits (450 feet), and the park markets itself as a creationist and family-centric vacation destination. Though the majority of this theme park’s distinctive attraction is the menagerie of 67 fiberglass animal couples, the theme park houses a wide breadth of activities and exhibits from a solar observatory telescope tower to a seaside café. The attraction encompasses areas such as the outdoor Nature Garden featuring live, rare animal species, an indoor jungle gym with swings and climbing areas called Noah’s Adventureland, and a resort on the top floor for lodging and dining. The park’s management unabashedly and hyperbolically promotes the ark as a refuge for visitors that may be in the midst of their own personal “floods.”",
23,Sun Hing Restaurant,Hong Kong,A half-century-old handmade dim sum joint opens daily at 3:00 a.m.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sun-hing-restaurant,"Tucked away on a busy street of Kennedy Town, Sun Hing is known for serving up heaping steamer baskets of fluffy char siu bao (barbecued pork buns), curried tripe, spare ribs, and Cantonese sponge cake to night owls starting at 3:00 a.m. every day. By the time the sun rises, the place is packed with customers ranging from elderly people sipping tea to students from the nearby university and still-tipsy revelers seeking late-night bites. Opened by Chui Hoi in 1972 and now run by his son, Sun Hing has become something of an institution—one well-worth either getting up or staying up for. While mass-production has crept into many of the city’s pricier dim sum halls, cooks here still prepare everything from scratch, from dainty quail’s egg siu mai to salted egg lava buns with a yolk custard that tastes like warm cake batter. Unlike modern dim sum restaurants, where diners normally check off the items on a paper menu, patrons at Sun Hing can still select their dishes from roving trolley carts. A server marks the table’s card with the corresponding numbers of selected dim sum, then tallies up the bill at the end. Tea is self-service, with a selection of loose-leaf options—including black tea, tie guan yin (Iron Buddha), and pu-erh—perched on a stainless-steel shelf. Diners can also watch cooks in the open kitchen rolling and flattening dough or skillfully folding dumpling wrappers into half-moon shapes. Servers continually call out fresh arrivals and it’s up to patrons to pounce on each new batch of dim sum before another table scoops it up.","Sharing a table with strangers is quite common at dim sum parlors. If you’re flying solo, you may sit with other diners at the same table but separated by plastic partitions."
24,Man Mo Temple Complex,Hong Kong,A serene space tucked amid the skyscrapers of Hong Kong's bustling financial district.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/man-mo-temple-complex,"Man Mo Temple Complex is a delicate building in the shadows of the skyscrapers of the financial district. It represents the traditional social organisation and religious practices of the Chinese community in old Hong Kong. The complex, built between 1847 and 1862, during the Qing dynasty by wealthy Chinese merchants, comprises of three parts: Man Mo Temple, Lit Shing Kung and Kung So. Man Mo Temple is dedicated to two deities, the God of Literature (Man Tai), holding a writing brush, and the God of Martial Arts (Mo Tai), having a sword. Both of them were worshipped by ambitious scholars and students seeking progress in their study or high ranking in the civil examinations of Imperial China. Lit Shing Kung was built for the worship of all the Chinese heavenly gods. Whereas, Kung So was an important assembly hall where community affairs and disputes could be discussed and settled. The complex is a fine example of traditional Chinese architecture and craftsmanship. The temple’s most memorable features are the rows of large red-coloured incense spirals suspended from the ceiling which are burned as offerings by worshippers. They take a couple of weeks to burn through. It provides a serene space in contrast with the hectic pace of the nearby financial district. The temple is also featured in a video game, Shenmue II for the Dreamcast and Xbox consoles. The temple and its grounds can be explored in the game. However, the virtual location of the temple is different from reality.",

Built to combat the rampant piracy and smuggling from the surrounding waters, the Tai O Police Station also aimed to instill British law and order throughout the entire island. One of the first police stations built on the outlying islands around Hong Kong, the building consists of two blocks of two stories, linked by a footbridge on the first level. Marked by its amalgam of architectural styles, the building includes arched verandas of the Italian Renaissance, a Chinese pan-and-roll roof, and elements of the Arts and Crafts style. Originally the station was staffed with fewer than ten policemen, and the building increasingly served as an administrative center, peaking with 180 employees in 1983. The low crime rate in the 400 year-old fishing village led to a demoted status as a patrol post in 1996, a role maintained until the station’s closing in 2002. Looking to revitalize a historic building, the Hong Kong government accepted a 2009 developer proposal to convert the station into a seaside lodge. Finished in 2012, the Tai O Heritage Hotel includes nine colonial-style rooms and ocean-view suites and even new roof-top restaurant. However to retain some semblance of its history of law and order, the redevelopment also restored the surrounding cannons, searchlight and guard towers. So be sure not to get too rowdy on your vacation as they also refurbished the jail cells.",
26,HSBC Building Feng Shui Cannons,Hong Kong,Two cannon-like cranes were installed on top of the bank building to fend off bad feng shui.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hsbc-building-feng-shui-cannons,"Built in 1985, the HSBC Building in downtown Hong Kong is the headquarters of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and one of the largest banks in the world. In 1990, the Bank of China Tower was built next door, and it’s now one of the most recognizable skyscrapers of Hong Kong. But the iconic tower’s unique shape came at a curious price: Feng shui principles were ignored. In fact, the Bank of China Tower is the only major building in Hong Kong that doesn’t follow the 3,000-year-old Chinese practice of feng shui, the belief that the energy of your environment affects well-being and prosperity. The HSBC Building was designed to have excellent feng shui. It is positioned with a clear view of the harbor, as water is associated with prosperity; the ground floor is an open atrium where wind and positive qi can flow; and the escalators were built at an angle because evil spirits can only travel in a straight line. The negative energy of the Bank of China Tower’s architecture, on the other hand, created some controversy. The pointed shapes of the tower look like sharp, knife-like edges, one pointing at the British Government House, and one pointing at the HSBC Building. The British Government House saw various misfortunes in the years following the tower’s construction, as one governor lost his job, and his successor had a heart attack, and the entire city suffered during an economic downturn. In order to defend against the bad luck of the Bank of China Tower’s design, two maintenance cranes in the shape of cannons pointing towards the tower were installed on top of the HSBC Building. Apparently, no negative effects were felt after the cannons were installed.",The cannon-like structures on top of the building can be seen from the street.

28,Jumbo Kingdom,Hong Kong,A colossal floating restaurant built to look like a ancient Chinese imperial palace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jumbo-kingdom,"A small trend of floating restaurants has built up in Hong Kong’s Aberdeen Harbor over the years, but none is so large or iconic as the bustling Chinese wonderland, Jumbo Kingdom. One of the largest floating restaurants in the world (of which there are surprisingly enough to make such a distinction), the Jumbo Floating Restaurant was built in 1976 after years of planning and millions of dollars worth of development. The incredible barge holds over four floors worth of eateries and attractions, ranging from fine dining to tea houses and wine gardens. Able to seat over 2,300 visitors at a time, the floating gargantuan is almost like a small city unto itself, with grand staircases and skinny walkways criss-crossing between the various establishments. While the site is known for its seafood, the exterior of the giant boat is likely the most memorable feature. Designed by Jumbo Kingdom’s builder, Dr. Stanley Ho, who is also known as “The King of Gambling,” due to his 40-year monopoly on the Macau gambling industry, the outside of the location is an ornately modern recreation of an ancient Chinese imperial palace. Decked out in countless neon lights and brightly colored flourishes, the remarkable ship looks like something out of a science-fiction film, incorporating traditional Chinese architecture and 21st century spectacle. Jumbo Kingdom is moored in the harbor and it’s continued success should keep it afloat for the foreseeable future.","To visit, take the free shuttle ferry that transports diners to and from the restaurant via Shum Wan and Aberdeen Pier."

But for those who have just been dying to bite into a dumpling shaped like her face, Hong Kong has you covered with Hello Kitty Chinese Cuisine. Hello Kitty is said to be more popular in Hong Kong than even in her native Japan, so it is little wonder that her first dim sum restaurant would spring up there. The eatery is awash in the adorable visage of the popular cartoon cat, starting with the sign outside. Then on the inside, you can’t swing, well, a dead cat without hitting some representation of the character. She’s on the dinnerware, chopsticks, wall decorations and even in the bathroom. Even the food is shaped like her dead-eyed round little face, her bow colored red with beet root, or her face molded out of white rice. The best part is, the whole place is sanctioned by Sanrio, the company that exerts a level of control over representations of Hello Kitty that rivals Disney’s obsession with standardizing Mickey Mouse. They trained the operators of Hello Kitty Chinese Cuisine on how to get the proportions right, and even gave them special molds and tools to make sure that the dishes, and by extension, Hello Kitty, don’t dip in quality. They also had to approve nearly every aspect of the restaurant. Whether you’re a fan of Hello Kitty or you just want to consume something adorable Hello Kitty Chinese Cuisine has really covered all the bases. Update January, 2018: Unfortunately, Hello Kitty Chinese Cuisine is permanently closed.  It is now called Hung Fong Vegetarian Restaurant.  There are locals on other websites claiming that they were at Hello Kitty within the past few months, so it must have closed recently and suddenly.",
30,Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter,Hong Kong,A small subculture of boat dwellers keep their traditional way of living alive at this Hong Kong Typhoon Shelter.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/causeway-bay-typhoon-shelter,"In the middle of the fleet of luxury yachts a distinct subculture still survives: a small group of boat dwellers living at the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter. The Tanka (boat dwellers) were among the early ethic subgroups of Hong Kong, The origins of the Tanka are uncertain, but it is generally accepted that they were indigenous people of Southern China who began dwelling on boats in coastal waters, because of their displacement by the invading Han from the north from 221 BC onwards, during the Qin Dynasty. The term Tanka is now considered derogatory and no longer is in common use. The boat dwellers were considered to be outcasts and they were despised by the land-dwelling Han. Later on, since they were boat dwellers who lived by the sea, they were sometimes referred to as “sea gypsies” by the Chinese and British. Though many now live onshore, some from the older generations still live on their narrow boats and keep alive their traditional way of living. Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter was the first typhoon shelter in Hong Kong. The original typhoon shelter was built after the 1874 typhoon, at the present location of Victoria Park, to provide shelter for fishing boats during storms. It was completed in 1883 with a breakwater only 427 metres. On September 18, 1906, a typhoon struck Hong Kong, destroying 3,653 boats and killing 15,000 people, most of them fishermen. Consequently, in March 1908 the Government carried out expansion works on the typhoon shelter, deepening it by 3 metres (9 feet). In 1953 the typhoon shelter was moved northwards to its present site and the original typhoon shelter was reclaimed to provide land for Victoria Park. Four decades ago, there were almost 40,000 people living on boats in the typhoon shelter, creating a thriving and distinct subculture. Today, there are only about 30 residents tacked away amidst luxury yachts. Many of them have homes on land as well. They make living by transporting people from the shore to their yachts, by taking passengers for a trip around Victoria Harbour or by providing “typhoon shelter cuisine.” One of the ships is a grocery store that provides supplies to the floating community. Also, moored at the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter is a floating temple dedicated to the goddess Tin Hau, the Chinese patron goddess protecting seafarers, docked at its current location since 1955. The temple houses a statue of her that was fished from the sea. Update January, 2017: This is no longer there as of December 2016. There is some work ongoing in the area, which is closed off and with no boats.",
31,Chand Baori,"Abhaneri, India","Thousands of exquisitely carved stone water storage wells, hundreds of stone steps fill this exquisite medieval stepwell.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-stepwells-india,"In 1864, the famous French world traveler Louis Rousselet described “[a] vast sheet of water, covered with lotuses in flower, amid which thousands of aquatic birds are sporting” at the shores of which bathers washed, surrounded by jungle greenery. He was not describing a lakeside scene or one of India’s famous riverside ghats, but an ancient well, as big as a large pond. In the northern Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, the problem of water is a profound one. At the edge of the Thar desert, the area sees torrential seasonal monsoons, and then watches the water disappear almost immediately. With summers routinely over 100 degrees, and silty soil that would not hold water in ponds, a practical solution was needed for locals and travelers along the local trade routes. In the first century, the slippery shores of the major rivers were tamed by the construction of ghats, long, shallow sets of stairs and landings. The same approach was applied to the construction of a new kind of well. The earliest stepwells most likely date to about 550, but the most famous were built in medieval times. It is estimated that over 3,000 stepwells were built in the two northern states. Although many have fallen into disrepair, were silted in at some point in antiquity, or were filled in with trash in the modern era, hundreds of wells still exist. In New Delhi alone, there are more than 30. Chand Baori in Abhaneri, near Jaipur, Rajasthan, is among the largest, if not the largest, of the stepwells. It is also perhaps the most visually spectacular: Chand Baori is a deep four-sided structure with an immense temple on one face. Some 3,500 Escher-esqe terraced steps march down the other three sides 13 stories to a depth of 100 feet. The construction dates to the 10th century, and is dedicated to Harshat Mata, goddess of joy and happiness. Water plays a special part in Hindu cosmology, as a boundary between heaven and earth known as tirtha. As manmade tirtha, the stepwells became not only sources of drinking water, but cool sanctuaries for bathing, prayer, and meditation. The wells are called by many names. In Hindi they are baori, baoli, baudi, bawdi, or bavadi. In Gujarati, spoken in Gujarat, they are commonly called vav. The architecture of the wells varies by type and by location, and when they were built. Two common types are a step pond, with a large open top and graduated sides meeting at a relatively shallow depth. The stepwell type usually incorporates a narrow shaft, protected from direct sunlight by a full or partial roof, ending in a deeper, rounded well-end. Temples and resting areas with beautiful carvings are built into many of the wells. In their prime, many of them were painted in bright colors of lime-based paint, and now traces of ancient colors cling to dark corners. The use and conditions of stepwells began to decline in the years of the British Raj, who were horrified by the unsanitary conditions of these drinking water bathing spots. They began to install pumps and pipes, and eventually outlawed the use of stepwells in some places. The remaining stepwells are in varying states of preservation, and some have gone dry. Local kids seem to find the ones with water to be terrific diving spots, which seems insanely hazardous.",

Known as Hawa Mahal in Hindi, the Palace of the Winds was constructed in 1799 for Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh as part of the women’s section of the enormous City Palace at the center of Jaipur. The facade we see from the street is essentially an enormous screened porch, one room deep in most places. The palace’s distinctive rosy color comes from the natural sandstone from which it is built which also gives Jaipur its nickname, “The Pink City.” The Palace of the Winds is considered one of the finest examples of Rajput architecture in India.",
33,The Root Bridges of Cherrapunji,"Cherrapunjee, India",Centuries-old bridges grown from tangled roots.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/root-bridges-cherrapungee,"In the depths of northeastern India, within sight of the India-Bangladesh border, in one of the wettest places on earth, bridges aren’t built—they’re grown. The southern Khasi and Jaintia hills are humid and warm, crisscrossed by swift-flowing rivers and mountain streams. On the slopes of these hills, a species of Indian rubber tree with an incredibly strong root system thrives and flourishes. The Ficus elastica produces a series of secondary roots from higher up its trunk and can comfortably perch atop huge boulders along the riverbanks, or even in the middle of the rivers themselves. The War-Khasis and War-Jaintias, two closely related tribes in Meghalaya, long ago noticed this tree and saw in its powerful roots an opportunity to easily cross the area’s many rivers. Now, whenever and wherever the need arises, they simply grow their bridges. In order to make a rubber tree’s roots grow in the right direction—say, over a river—the people of southern Meghalaya have used several different strategies. Sometimes, the roots of the trees are simply pulled, tied, twisted, and encouraged by hand to merge with each other, until, over time, they form the desired architectural structure. Root bridges have also been made by creating scaffolds out of wood and bamboo, and then training the young roots out across these temporary structures, replacing the more perishable elements many times as they rot in the intense monsoon seasons. In some places, such as around the village of Nongriat, betel nut trunks, sliced down the middle and hollowed out, are used to create root-guidance systems. The thin, tender roots of the rubber tree, prevented from fanning out by the betel nut trunks, grow straight out. The trunks also have the added advantage of providing the roots with additional nutrients as they decay. When they reach the other side of the river, they’re allowed to take root in the soil. Given enough time a sturdy, living bridge is produced. The root bridges can grow for as long as the organism they are a part of remains healthy, though they can take many years to initially become functional, the length of time being dependent on local conditions such as the health of the tree, the way the bridge is being grown, and the availability of nutrients in the soil that its being grown in. However, once root bridges become established, they’re extraordinarily strong—strong enough that some of them can support the weight of 50 or more people at a time. In fact, because they are alive and still growing, the bridges actually gain strength over time—and some of the ancient root bridges used daily by the people of the villages around Cherrapunji may be well over 500 years old. The roots bridges of southern Meghalaya come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They have been known to grow as long as 170 feet, and soar 80 feet above the streams they cross. Most living root bridges only have a single span, yet several have more than one, arranged as either as two parallel spans,  or as two bridges stacked one over the other, such as the famous “Umshiang Double-Decker Root Bridge.” The practice of creating new living bridges, and of preserving ones already in existence, is over large parts of Southern Meghalaya slowly fading out. In many villages across the region, the root bridges are little more than a memory.  However, since they began attracting attention again in around 2004, local dedication to the bridges has, at least in a few places, kept them from being destroyed in favor of steel ones. What’s more, a few new root bridges are currently under construction. In the village of Rangthylliang, an entirely new bridge is being grown using a bamboo and wood scaffold, and at the double-decker site in Nongriat, a new, third span is currently being grown above the other two, and should be ready for use within a decade. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Root Bridges of Cherrapunji.","While there are dozens of root bridges, which can be found all throughout the valleys between (very roughly!) the towns of Mawsynram and Dawki, few of these are easily accessible, or have nearby tourist facilities. To visit the bridges in the more remote areas, a local guide is an absolute must! A number of these bridges can be reached from Cherrapunjee Holiday Resort. Local maps to the bridges are available from the Resort. The ""Umshiang Double-Decker Root Bridge"" is located in the village of Nongriat. Visitors can walk here from the small village of Tyrna. The village is accessible from Cherrapunjee by shared or private taxi. From the village, 2500 steps must be traversed to reach Nongriat. The walk takes about 1.5 - 2 hours each way. Nongriat offers basic accommodation to visitors, so it's possible to stay overnight for a more relaxed experience. Serene Guest House is the best run establishment in Nongriat. From Nongriat, short hikes can lead you to several nearby root bridges, include several upstream from the village, a small, nice one, in the village of Mynteng, and several spectacular examples in the village of Nongthymmai. A large number of living root bridges are known to exist in the jungles around the town of Pynursla. To reach these, many of which are deep in the jungle and require several hours of tough hiking, make sure to find a reliable, local, guide. The Rangthylliang Eco-Tourism society comes highly recommended, and can arrange your stay while in the area. Another option for visiting root bridges is the beautiful, remote, village of Kongthong, which has several in the near vicinity. The Kongthong Travelers Nest is a great base to explore the area from, with several spectacular root bridges within a few hours walk. There's also the village of Shnongpdeng, in the West Jaintia Hills, near Dawki, which can be used as a great staging area to explore several villages with root bridges. Recommended are Kudeng Rim, Padu, and Burma. All of these villages have very little in the way of tourist facilities, so make sure to ask for help planning your visit in Shnongpdeng! Please respect the area's natural surroundings."
34,Skeletons of Roopkund Lake,"Chamoli, India",A lake with hundreds of ancient skeletons surrounding it. The surprise is what killed them.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skeleton-lake-of-roopkund-india,"In 1942 a British forest guard in Roopkund, India made an alarming discovery. Some 16,000 feet above sea level, at the bottom of a small valley, was a frozen lake absolutely full of skeletons. That summer, the ice melting revealed even more skeletal remains, floating in the water and lying haphazardly around the lake’s edges. Something horrible had happened here. The immediate assumption (it being war time) was that these were the remains of Japanese soldiers who had died of exposure while sneaking through India. The British government, terrified of a Japanese land invasion, sent a team of investigators to determine if this was true. However upon examination they realized these bones were not from Japanese soldiers—they weren’t fresh enough. It was evident that the bones were quite old indeed. Flesh, hair, and the bones themselves had been preserved by the dry, cold air, but no one could properly determine exactly when they were from. More than that, they had no idea what had killed over 200 people in this small valley. Many theories were put forth including an epidemic, landslide, and ritual suicide. For decades, no one was able to shed light on the mystery of Skeleton Lake. However, a 2004 expedition to the site seems to have finally revealed the mystery of what caused those people’s deaths. The answer was stranger than anyone had guessed. As it turns out, all the bodies date to around 850 AD. DNA evidence indicates that there were two distinct groups of people, one a family or tribe of closely related individuals, and a second smaller, shorter group of locals, likely hired as porters and guides. Rings, spears, leather shoes, and bamboo staves were found, leading experts to believe that the group was comprised of pilgrims heading through the valley with the help of the locals. All the bodies had died in a similar way, from blows to the head. However, the short deep cracks in the skulls appeared to be the result not of weapons, but rather of something rounded. The bodies also only had wounds on their heads, and shoulders as if the blows had all come from directly above. What had killed them all, porter and pilgrim alike? Among Himalayan women there is an ancient and traditional folk song. The lyrics describe a goddess so enraged at outsiders who defiled her mountain sanctuary that she rained death upon them by flinging hailstones “hard as iron.” After much research and consideration, the 2004 expedition came to the same conclusion. All 200 people died from a sudden and severe hailstorm. Trapped in the valley with nowhere to hide or seek shelter, the “hard as iron” cricket ball-sized [about 23 centimeter/9 inches circumference] hailstones came by the thousands, resulting in the travelers’ bizarre sudden death. The remains lay in the lake for 1,200 years until their discovery.","There are no roads to this place yet, so one has to undertake a 3-4 day trek to reach the skeleton lake starting from Gwaldum in Chamoli district. The skeleton lake is covered with ice for most of the time during the year."
35,Jal Mahal,"Jaipur, India",More than half of this Indian palace is drowned but it looks all the more spectacular for it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jal-mahal,"Located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake, a man-made reservoir created in 1596, the Jal Mahal (or “Water Palace”) only appears to be one story high, although there are four more levels to the building hidden beneath the water. Although the name translates to “Water Palace,” the building was never intended to be a palace, as such, but was instead conceived as a hunting lodge for the local Raja (King). In the 16th-century, a severe drought spurred the locals to create a dam, creating the lake that submerged the lower portions of the lodge. During the 18th century, the water-locked lodge was renovated and the lake area was expanded. For a great deal of the temple’s history, visitors were able to take gondolas across the lake waters to visit the historic faux-palace. The rooftop of the structure manages to support foliage and from the shoreline it almost looks like the castle is still in use. Today the building is inaccessible to tourists, although plans are afoot to convert it into a restaurant. Visitors wishing to see the building will have to suffice with the view from land which is even more spectacular in the evenings when the ancient Water Palace is illuminated as though there is some secret soirée occurring just out of reach.",
36,Ellora Caves,"Verul, India","This complex of vertically-excavated Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu monolithic temples in India's Maharashtra providence illustrates a spirit of tolerance characteristic of ancient India.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ellora-caves,"Religious devotion was not uncommon in ancient times, but tolerance was often much harder to come by. Happily, for curious travelers and religious devotees alike, the caves at Ellora offer a truly exceptional example of both. Covering an area more than 2 kilometers in size, the Ellora Caves are a massive and humbling tribute to faith and medieval-era workmanship in India. In fact, the term “caves” hardly does justice to the 34 Buddhist, Brahmanist and Jainist temples in Ellora, each painstakingly carved out of the mountainside and filled with delicate works of art. Sculpted Buddhas and other religious figures abound, along with intricately carved images in the walls and decorative fixtures on the temples, usually seen in traditionally masoned buildings, but hardly common for something excavated out of solid rock - particularly using the tools and workforce available in the 5th through 10th centuries, when these temples were created. It’s truly hard to believe that the temples are, in fact, vertically excavated out of stone. Many of them put much easier-to-construct buildings to shame with their elaborate design, demonstrating both the strength of religious conviction that went into their creation as well as the highly skilled craftsmen who participated. It is a feat that would be difficult to match even with modern techniques, and of course far less likely to be undertaken due to the cost and time it would take to create it. But the delicate excavation isn’t the only feature of the Ellora Caves that would be unlikely to find in the modern era. The caves feature art, temple and habitation space from three different religions, proving the level of tolerance and cooperation among the disparate religious groups in India at the time of their creation. The three groups shared the space peacefully throughout the centuries, unafraid to worship near idols of a competing religion – something that would still be remarkable today, or in most other cultural eras for that matter. Indeed, the tolerance is likely not just a nice angle on the story of these temples – it’s likely exclusively due to the remarkable cooperation amongst religious beliefs that the caves became so elaborate and impressive, something any one group may not have been able to accomplish alone, and undoubtedly more grand than they otherwise would have been.",

In the city of Jodhpur, a sea of boxy indigo houses stretches for more than 10 kilometers along the walls of the historic walled old city. A blue pigment coating on a house used to indicate that a Brahmin—the priests of the Indian caste system—dwelled there, but over time the color became a badge of identity for non-Brahmins, too. It’s also said to have insect-repelling abilities. Situated on the edge of the Thar Desert, Jodhpur is also called the “Sun City,” named for the overwhelming amount of bright and sunny days it experiences. It is home to famed forts, palaces, mausoleums, gardens, lakes, and towers, making it a hotspot for tourist activity. Since its founding more than 500 years ago, the city has earned renown for its textile industry, exquisite furniture shops, delectable cuisine, and bustling bazaars, among many other attractions. But above all, visitors aren’t likely to forget the eye-catching color coating the houses, creating a luscious blue sea in the arid Indian landscape.

38,Shatrunjaya Hill,"Gheti, India",A mecca for India's Jains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shatrunjaya-hill,"As typified by Muslims’ pilgrimages to Mecca or Jews’ to Jerusalem, most religions have epic places to where devotees can travel to better secure their places in heaven. The pilgrimage site for Jains, an Indian religious group, is particularly epic: a hugely complex series of more than 1,000 temples which pilgrims can reach only by climbing up nearly 4,000 steps. Jainism is a relatively small religion, with only a little over 4 million believers in India and small pockets of followers throughout the rest of the world. The Jains’ primary belief is non-violence; they believe that people, animals and even plants have souls and should be treated equally and well. Although they have no gods or spiritual figures, they do live with the principle of reincarnation in mind, hoping to eventually be liberated from the cycle of life and rebirth in an eternal transcedence. The Shatrunjaya Hill site is huge and pilgrimage rites are difficult for such an ascetic religion. The hill’s 3,950 steps often take three hours to climb, with the elderly often hiring a dholi, a seat attached to a pole carried by strong men, to the top. It is the goal of devout Jains to climb the mountain 99 times in their lifetimes. Once at the top, devotees are expected to pay homage at each of the complex’s many tuks, similar to temples. In worship, Jains sweep the grounds with brooms and remove their shoes so they don’t kill anything before sitting down. Then, white-robed pilgrims, monks and nuns chant sacred texts surrounded by Tirthankaras, similar to unclothed Buddha statues. In their building, the temples followed the Jainist principle of non-violence. None of the temples were built with ivory or clay because it contains micro-organisms and insects. Instead, all of the temples – the oldest of which dates back to the 11th century – are made of marble, bronze or stone.",215 kilomters from Ahmedabad and 51 kilometers from Bhavnagar
39,Mahabat Maqbara,"Junagadh, India",This otherworldly palace-mausoleum complex is the stuff eternal dreams are made of.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mahabat-maqbara,"Along a busy road in the heart of Junagadh city lies one of India’s least-known, yet most jaw-dropping architectural oddities. A smashing blend of Gothic and Islamic ornamentation, the Mahabat Maqbara complex remains one of India’s best kept secrets. This striking structure rising from out of nowhere is the mausoleum of Wazir Bahaduddinbhai Hasainbhai, one of the chief nobles in the Court of Nawab Mahabat Khan II of Junagadh. Construction on the yellow-walled complex began in 1878 by Mahabat Khanji and was completed in 1892 by his successor, Bahadur Khanji. Over a decade’s worth of work culminated in elaborate carvings on the buildings’ inner and outer façades, fine arches, French-style windows, columns and shining silver doorways. On the adjacent mosque, each minaret is encircled from top to bottom with winding staircases. Both buildings topped with distinctive “onion dome” rooflines. The monument’s seemingly perplexing mixture of Indo-Islamic, European, and Gothic architecture makes a bit more sense when considered in the larger context of the complex history of the district of Junagadh itself. Founded in 1748, Junagadh had officially become a British Protectorate in 1807 though was handed over to the East India Company’s control in 1818. For the rest of Great Britain’s colonial rule of India, the Saurashtra region escaped direct administration of British India. Instead, the British divided the territory into more than 100 princely states – including Junagadh – which remained in existence until 1947. The city’s present old town, built during the 19th and 20th centuries, existed in a sort of gubernatorial no man’s land. It is in this very spot that the Mahabat Maqbara complex was built, during the period of Britain’s occupation of India. At the time of India’s independence from British rule in 1947, incumbent ruler Mahabat Khan III elected to join Pakistan despite Junagadh having no common boundary with the new country. Under pressure from the Indian government he fled to Pakistan, and Junagadh reunited with India just three short months after declaring its independence. Despite the nonstop political tumult at its doorstep, Mahabat Maqbara has stood like a beacon as it quietly assumed the diversity of influences surrounding it. For interested visitors, access to the grounds is free, and the entirety of the mosque is open to all. Wazir Bahaduddinbhai Hasainbhai’s mausoleum, however, is explorable from the outside only, though it is said that keys to the interior can be procured from a keeper from the mosque.","Just off MG Road, 5 minutes from the Junagadh Railway Station"
40,The Great Wall of India,"Rajsamand, India",The second-longest continuous wall on the planet protects a hidden secret in the deserts of India.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-wall-india,"The wall that surrounds the ancient fort of Kumbhalgarh is one of the best-kept secrets in India, and perhaps the world. Protecting a massive fort that contains over 300 ancient temples, the wall was constructed half a millennium ago in tandem with Kumbhalgarh Fort itself. Often referred to as Kumbhalgarh Wall or simply as Kumbhalgarh Fort as a whole, the wall is perhaps best known by its most sensational—and fitting—name: The Great Wall of India. This is appropriate, as the wall extends over 36 kilometers (22 miles) around the perimeter of the fort, making it the second-longest continuous wall on the planet after the far more well-known Great Wall of China. Its anonymity is mystifying, since this is no crumbling line of bricks fascinating only by description. The wall is massive and breathtakingly majestic as it snakes through valleys and along mountaintops, again bearing a striking resemblance to its cousin in China. At its widest sections, the wall is 15 meters thick and beautifully masoned with thousands of stone bricks and decorative flourishes along the top, making this just as attractive as a tourist destination as it once was effective as a deterrent. This gaudy defense is fitting for the perimeter wall of Kumbhalgarh Fort, itself a hulking, imposing construction, with its many pregnant ramparts bowing out into the desert in boulder-like configurations, stacked atop one another and giving the fort the appearance of a mountain. Kumbhalgarh Fort, together with five other forts in the area, is registered as designated UNESCO World Heritage Site—Hill Forts of Rajasthan. Visitors should beware that this piece of history, while alluring and well-preserved, is not well-trafficked. That remoteness and the potential to have miles of ruins all to oneself is appealing to plenty of off-the-beaten-path travelers, but the walls are tall, the stone hard, and while many of the traps and defensive mechanisms along the wall and fort have been deactivated, that does not mean accidents cannot happen. The most pleasant weather conditions in the area are from October through March.","Kumbhalgarh is a good option for a day trip from Udaipur. You can hire a car and driver from the local travel agencies in Udaipur for about 2,800-3,600 rupees for a full day. There are also hourly buses from Udaipur to Kelwara village near the Fort. Bus journey takes about three hours and costs some 50 rupees."
41,Hampi,"Hampi, India","The remains of what was, not so long ago, the world's largest city.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hampi,"On the boulder-strewn banks of the Tungabhadra River in Karnataka lie the ruins of Hampi, where the capital of the Vijayanagara Kingdom once stood. From 1336 to its fall in 1565, when it was sacked by Muslim invaders from the North, this was the Hindu capital of Vijayanagara Empire in Southern India. At that time, archaeologists estimate the city held about 250,000 people, which would have made it the largest city in the world. The site at Hampi is home to countless architectural wonders. As in other ancient, abandoned cities—like Palmyra or Teotihuacan—it is possible to stroll down the overgrown paths from building to building and imagine the splendid metropolis that Hampi once was. But in these famous ruins, one must also remember that it was not even 500 years ago (quite recent, archaeologically speaking) that this metropolis was bigger than that of Rome, Baghdad or Istanbul. The Vijayanagar style of architecture combined the Islamic style popular in Northern India with more Eastern elements, creating a new, unique mode that archaeologists call Indo-Saracenic architecture. The result: buildings that feature the stunning geometrical patterns and important structural advances made popular by Islamic builders, but also contain beautiful carvings and sculptures of Hindu gods and other important mythical figures. Besides the magnificent Virupaksha Temple—composed of successively smaller stories so that from below, the building seems to stretch unfathomably high—there are several fascinating structures not to miss, including the Lotus Mahal, the geometrically intricate Stepped Tank, and the iconic stone chariot (pulled by little stone elephants). Be sure to take in the banks of the rushing river, with its incredibly large and precariously positioned boulders. Hampi was made a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1986.","Fly to Hubli and drive 3 hours west or take the overnight train from Bangalore. Carry scarves to cover your face. it is quite dusty. And mosquito repellants. You will have to walk a lot, so carry walking shoes.   There is a Bus service to the Vitthala temple (Stone Chariot) which is a little far away from the main temple. You can rent bikes, but bikes are not allowed within the ancient city limits and near monuments.  Not everybody understands or speaks English or Hindi. They speak a regional dialect of Kannada. So your top priority would be to find someone who speaks the language you understand and keep a map with you at all times so you don't miss out and can navigate back to your hotel. Hampi Village (this is where the rice fields and boulders are) and Hampi City (this is where the ancient ruins are) are separated by the Tungabhadra river. Boat services to and fro run for a limited period during the day. The river can get fierce during rains, so it is advisable to stay on the city side. And it takes almost 2 hours (75 kilometres) by road, connecting the village to the city. But it is quite a picturesque ride."

Here, Hindu pilgrims gather to bathe in the sacred springs and reservoirs of the massive complex, which is situated on a hill, high above the flatlands of Rajasthan. A total of seven pools of natural spring water are within the area of Galtaji. The most sacred is Galta Kund, a reservoir that never goes dry. Alongside the lush natural springs are a number of other temples dedicated to various deities and spirits. A temple dedicated to the Hindu monkey god Hanuman is one of the most famous on the site because a tribe of his present day monkey relatives resides there. Along with living in the Galtaji temple, the monkeys also dangle from the intricate temple facades and cause chaos for visitors and pilgrims. They are well known in Jaipur and especially in Galtaji for their mischievous ways. Ironically, the monkeys’ famously naughty behavior is in stark contrast to their seemingly tranquil home. They even engage in fights, robberies, and general havoc right next to calm and sacred pools. Luckily for the monkeys, they are protected by their sacred status and connection to Hanuman. While it is unclear whether their behavior has made them a pest in the temple, it is obvious that it has brought them a small degree of fame.

43,Nek Chand Saini's Rock Garden,"Chandigarh, India",A palatial sculpture park was built illegally and in secret by a self-taught artist over 36 years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nek-chand-saini,"In 1957, Nek Chand, a lower-level government inspector, began collecting rocks behind a government building in Chandigarh, northern India. His innocent hobby began to expand, and during the 1960s, Chand began assembling the rocks, along with pieces of trash he had collected into an exhibition. Construction scraps from Le Corbusier’s vision for Chandigarh, along with broken household items began to take shape as sculptures, and the Nek Chand Saini was born. Although his work was illegal and would have been shut down had it been discovered, in 1976 Chand showed the garden to his superiors and was subsequently given permission and a labor force to further his artistic pursuits. From that time, Chand gave up government work and focused on the garden. Chand and a team of 50 men began heavy work in the mid-1970s and gave the garden a new life force. Sculptures of groups of people, all comprised of recycled materials, took shape around the garden. In many ways, the Rock Garden looks more like a fully functioning village than an art exhibition or statuary. Hundreds of statues dance across the mosaic tiles of the garden, inviting visitors to join in the merriment of Chand’s work. Visitors are even able to join in the community, by using the swing that is suspended beneath the great arches within the garden. Wild gangs of elephants, monkeys, and other animal sculptures also populate the garden, speckling the interior with life. In a country known more for the slums that grow out of its waste, the recycled outsider art of the Rock Garden is an internal triumph and an external spectacle. The garden now spans over 30 acres connected throughout by carefully designed walled passages and trails. Along with the jubilant sculptures, a series of waterfalls designed by Chand, provides a lush atmosphere, giving the entire garden the feeling of a living, breathing jungle community. One of the largest waterfalls descends from a pavilion in the garden, where visitors can walk directly up to the splashing rock wall. Chand’s garden is especially unique in this sense, as the whole area has been created for a whole-body experience of walking, touching, and enjoying the beautiful community that began as a small rock collection. The garden is a living and colorful tribute to art and ingenuity and a wholly Indian exhibition. It is detailed down to the mosaic tiling that visitors walk across in the garden. From the time of its creation, the garden has received worldwide acclaim and can easily be visited from Chandigarh.","Train from New Delhi to Chandigarh, The Shatabdi Express, runs two or three times daily from New Delhi to Chandigarh. The journey lasts approximately three hours. The Rock Garden is situated in the north of Chandigarh, Sector 1, and is known by everyone in the city."

When they returned, Jai Singh ordered the construction of the original Jantar Mantar complex in New Delhi, a monumental astronomical observatory constructed entirely out of stone and based on the astronomical tables of the French mathematician Phillipe de la Hire. In all Sawai Jai Singh built a total of five observatories, with the largest being this later construction of the Jantar Mantar in his hometown of Jaipur. Among the stone instruments Jai Singh constructed was the Samrat Yantra, a 73-foot-tall sundial. Though indistinguishable in design from other sundials of the day, it was far and away the most accurate. Its two-second interval markings are more precise than even de la Hire’s table. The smaller but older (and pink) version of the Jantar Mantar can be seen in New Delhi. In 2011, the 31-meter Reloj Solar Multicaja-Zaragoza was completed in Spain, and claimed the title of largest sundial in the world.",
45,Ajanta Caves,"Ajanta, India",Rock-cut cave complex filled with ancient Buddhist artwork.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ajanta-caves,"Constructed over an 800 year period, the Ajanta Caves span a massive rock face in Maharashtra and are filled with ornate frescoes considered masterpieces of Buddhist art. Ajanta is split into two main series of caves, one built in 200 BCE and the other finished around 600 CE. Each cave opens up into grand halls, bedecked from floor to ceiling in detailed depiction of the Jataka stories, which tell of the Buddha’s past life. These caves are excavated in horse–shoe shaped bend of rock surface nearly 76 m in height overlooking a narrow stream known as Waghora. The location of this valley provided a calm and serene environment for the Buddhist monks who retreated at these secluded places during the rainy seasons. This retreat also provided them with enough time for furthering their religious pursuits through intellectual discourses for a considerably longer period. The caves were excavated in different periods (circa. 2nd century B.C. to 6th century A.D.) according to the necessity. Each cave was connected to the stream by a flight of steps, which are now almost obliterated, albeit traces of some could be noticed at some places. In all, total 30 excavations were hewn out of rock which also include an unfinished one. Out of these, five (cave no. 9, 10, 19, 26, and 29) are chaityagrihas and the rest are viharas. In date and style also, these caves can be divided into two broad groups. The earliest excavations belong to the Hinayana phase of Buddhism of which similar examples could also be seen at Bhaja, Kondane, Pitalkhora, Nasik, etc. In total, 5 caves at Ajanta belong to this phase, viz., 9 & 10 which are chaityagrihas and 8, 12, 13, & 15A which are viharas. These caves are datable to the pre-Christian era, the earliest among them being Cave 10 dating from the second century B.C. The object of worship is a stupa here and these caves exhibit the imitation of wooden construction to the extent that the rafters and beams are also sculpted even though they are non-functional. The addition of new excavations could be noticed again during the period of Vakatakas, the contemporaries of the Imperial Guptas. The caves were caused to be excavated by royal patronage and the feudatories under the Vakatakas as illustrated by the inscriptions found in the caves. Varahadeva, the minister of Vakataka king Harishena (A.D. 475-500) dedicated Cave 16 to the Buddhist Sangha while Cave 17 was the gift of a prince (who subjugated Asmaka) feudatory to the same king. The flurry of activities at Ajanta was between mid 5th century A.D. to mid 6th century A.D. However, Hieun Tsang, the famous Chinese traveller who visited India during the first half of 7th century A.D. has left a vivid and graphic description of the flourishing Buddhist establishment here even though he did not visit the caves. A solitary Rashtrakuta inscription in cave no. 26 indicates its use during 8th – 9th centuries A.D. The second phase departs from the earlier one with the introduction of new pattern in layout as well as the centrality of Buddha image, both in sculpture as well as in paintings The world famous paintings at Ajanta also fall into two broad phases. The earliest is noticed in the form of fragmentary specimens in cave nos. 9 & 10, which are datable to second century B.C. The headgear and other ornaments of the images in these paintings resemble the bas-relief sculpture of Sanchi and Bharhut. The second phase of paintings started around 5th – 6th centuries A.D. and continued for the next two centuries. The specimen of these exemplary paintings of Vakataka period could be noticed in cave nos. 1, 2, 16 and 17. The variation in style and execution in these paintings also are noticed, mainly due to different authors of them. A decline in the execution is also noticed in some paintings as indicated by some rigid, mechanical and lifeless figures of Buddha in some later period paintings. The main theme of the paintings is the depiction of various Jataka stories, different incidents associated with the life of Buddha, and the contemporary events and social life also. The ceiling decoration invariably consists of decorative patterns, geometrical as well as floral. The paintings were executed after elaborate preparation of the rock surface initially. The rock surface was left with chisel marks and grooves so that the layer applied over it can be held in an effective manner. The ground layer consists of a rough layer of ferruginous earth mixed with rock-grit or sand, vegetable fibres, paddy husk, grass and other fibrous material of organic origin on the rough surface of walls and ceilings. A second coat of mud and ferruginous earth mixed with fine rock-powder or sand and fine fibrous vegetable material was applied over the ground surface. Then the surface was finally finished with a thin coat of lime wash. Over this surface, outlines are drawn boldly, then the spaces are filled with requisite colours in different shades and tones to achieve the effect of rounded and plastic volumes. The colours and shades utilised also vary from red and yellow ochre, terra verte, to lime, kaolin, gypsum, lamp black and lapis lazuli. The chief binding material used here was glue. The paintings at Ajanta are not frescoes as they are painted with the aid of a binding agent, whereas in fresco the paintings are executed while the lime wash is still wet which, thereby acts as an intrinsic binding agent.",

A masterpiece of architecture, construction, and adornment, Rani ki vav in Patan, Gujarat, is the only stepwell to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is considered the foremost example of this type of complex architectural technique, demonstrating great beauty in proportion and detail. It is believed that Rani ki vav (in Gujarat, a “vav” is a type of stepwell) was constructed by Rani Udaymati in the memory of Raja Bhimdev, son of Mularaja, the founder of the Solanki dynasty. The sculptures represent religious, mythological, and secular images. The central theme of the images is around 10 incarnations of Vishnu. At the water level, there is a sculpture of Vishnu reclining on a 1,000-headed snake. Other sculptures represent apsaras (celestial nymphs), strikingly beautiful in feature and pose. Like other vavs, Rani ki vav was not only used for water collecting; it held great spiritual significance and was also a place for socializing. It was built on the banks of the Saraswati River, and it flooded and was silted over until the 1980s. It was restored to its original design and is now in very good condition.","Rani ki vav is situated in the town of Patan, about 77 miles from the capital, Ahmedabad, a three-hour journey. There are many trains and buses from Ahmedabad to Patan. It’s open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The best time to visit Rani ki vav is in the morning, when it first opens. There are few people there and the golden sunlight will make it very photogenic."
49,Golden Temple,"Amritsar, India","This peaceful Sikh gurudwara serves around 50,000 free meals every day within its gilded walls.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golden-temple,"Every day, Shri Harmandir Sahib, known worldwide as the Golden Temple, serves upwards of 100,000 free meals to whoever shows up. This beautiful gold-coated gurudwara (temple) in Amritsar is the most sacred place for Sikhs. IIt’s both the spiritual and temporal centre of the religion, and thousands of pilgrims, tourists, and followers arrive daily to worship, pray, volunteer, and soak up the peaceful vibes. The Sikh religion rests on several important values, including equality and community service. To that end, every gurudwara offers langar, a free communal kitchen. The langar at Golden Temple follows this tradition on a big scale, in keeping with the size of the gurudwara and the number of visitors it gets. You have to see the communal kitchen to believe it. The huge size of the rooms, cooking vats, mounds of food, plus the numbers of people prepping, cooking, and cleaning is a site to behold. It’s virtually a small army at work, and many of them are volunteers. Lentils are cooked in huge vats, on open fires, that take two people with large wooden paddles, to stir. While some volunteers prepare and roll rotis, a roti-making machine was brought in a few years ago to keep up with the capacity. It can make 25,000 rotis an hour. The kitchen uses 12,000 kilograms of flour, 1,600 kilograms of pulses (lentils), 1,600 kilograms of vegetables, and 1,400 kilograms of rice per day. About 25 percent of the food is donated. A traditional vegetarian meal of rice, lentils, vegetables, and rotis is served in two large dining halls that each accommodate 5,000 people. Everyone sits on the floor, in long rows, as volunteer servers walk up and down dishing out food. A machine on wheels serves clean, filtered drinking water, and another one serves tea. The metal plates, bowls, cups, and cutlery are all washed by a small army, too. A total of about 500 employees and 250 volunteers work in the kitchen at a time. Volunteers are allowed to do everything except cooking. Langar was started by the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak, to uphold the principle of equality. All people, regardless of religion, gender, caste, class, and color sit together on the floor to eat. It was a revolutionary concept in 16th century India, when Sikhism began. The langar also expresses the ethics of sharing, community, and inclusiveness.",The Golden Temple is open every day and meals are served starting at 8 a.m.
50,Bhangarh Fort,"Bhangarh, India","This abandoned fort is said to be the most haunted place in India, so much so that entry is prohibited after sunset.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bhangarh-fort,"Built in the 17th century, India’s Bhangarh Fortis thought to be the most haunted place in all of India, causing the local populace to build a town away from the abandoned military installation and outlaw anyone from entering the grounds after sunset. Technically, Bhangarh Fort is actually a small city with temples, palaces, and multiple gates. The sprawling grounds cover a swath of land at the foot of a picturesque mountain, but according to locals, all is not well in on the well preserved grounds. A number of legends regarding the lonely historical buildings exist, but two stand out above the rest. One legend speaks of a holy man who lived in the area of the fort and built a house which he did not want any other house to eclipse, warning that should the shadow of any taller building ever touch his abode, he would destroy the entire fort city. Which he assumedly did. The second prominent legend involves a curse that was laid on the city by a mythical wizard as he was killed by a woman he had just tried to magically dose. As he was crushed by a boulder, he cursed the city to be destroyed and sure enough, a marauding soon sacked the fort, killed each and every resident. If you are considering visiting Bhangarh Fort then you will have to go during the day time. In fact, one of the departments of the Government of India has prohibited entry between sunset and sunrise. The Archeological Survey of India, the body that looks after historical monuments in India, has a sign that notices visitors of this rule. I have no idea why they have a sign post in Hindi and not in English considering that Rajasthan is a place where people from all over the place visit. Perhaps one of the reasons could be that this particular place is not popular amongst foreign tourists hence they have not bothered to have a sign in English. The signboard simply says“…It is strictly prohibited to enter the borders of Bhangarh before sunrise and after sunset. Legal action would be taken against those who do not follow these instructions…” It seems to be warning visitors to stay away during dark. There is a local saying that if you do enter this area, you will not return. These fanciful tales may seem outlandish, but the stories were so pervasive that the entire fort city was abandoned and the citizens established a whole new city nearby (Bhangarh). Today, the abandoned buildings are remarkably well preserved, and available to be visited during daylight hours. They offer guided sunset yoga at the platforms of the temples. The fear of the city’s ghosts led the Archeological Survey of India to post a sign forbidding entry to the area after dark.","If you are considering visiting Bhangarh Fort, then you will have to go during the day time.

51,Elephanta Caves,"Gharapuri, India","An extraordinary ""City of Caves"" carved from solid stone.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephanta-caves,"When the Portuguese arrived on the west coast of India in 1534, they discovered an extraordinary island riddled with ancient galleries carved from the solid rock of the hillsides. Filled with exquisite carvings and standing sculptures, they named the island and its “city of caves” Elephanta, after the monumental elephant they found on the island. Then they began using the carvings for target practice. Located off the coast of Mumbai, the Elephanta Caves on Elephanta Island (also known as the Island of Gharapuri) are thought to date as far back as the 5th to 8th centuries, although their origins remain mysterious. There are seven caves carved from the rocky basalt hillside, including both Buddhist and Hindu sculptures and bas reliefs. The larger group of five caves feature Hindu imagery, while a smaller group of caves on the eastern side of the island are Buddhist. Originally painted, the now plain stone has survived the centuries a bit worse for wear but extraordinary nonetheless. An important part of Indian architectural tradition, there are more than 1500 rock-cut structures in India—more than anywhere else in the world. The caves at Elephanta are only a small portion of extraordinary rock architecture in the country, such as the rock-hewn temples at the Ellora and Ajanta complexes. The Elephanta Caves were restored in 1970, and are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are still concerns for the future of the caves, suffering both from the elements and ravages of time, as well as pressures from tourism and a growing population on the island. The elephant carving originally standing guard on the island is now on display at Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Mumbai.",
52,Meenakshi Amman Temple,"Madurai, India",This ancient Hindu temple is covered in thousands of colorful statues and has a long mythological history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/meenakshi-amman-temples,"The Meenakshi Amman Temple is the heart of the ancient city of Madurai in Tamil Nadu, India. A religious and mythological symbol dating back 2,500 years, the temple’s 14 towers are each covered in thousands of colorful stone figures depicting animals, gods and demons. This sacred site draws in upwards of one million visitors each year for the 10-day Chithirai Festival to celebrate the marriage of Meenakshi (the Hindu Goddess Parvati) to Sundareswara (the Hindu God Shiva) — a divine marriage believed by Hindus to be the “biggest event on Earth.” According to ancient Tamil literature, the Meenakshi Amman Temple was originally built 2,500 years ago by survivors of the lost continent Kumari Kandam, a mythological triangle-shaped continent that was said to span the Indian Ocean, touching Australia, Madagascar and India. Although this continent’s existence is currently disproven, members of the Tamil Renaissance Movement once believed it to be the hearth of Tamil culture. But that’s all mythology. In fact, the temple was built by Tamil Hindus native to southeastern India, and it first appeared in recorded history in the 600s AD. In the 1300s, the sacred structure was ransacked and destroyed by the Muslim general Malik Kafur in a successful attempt to spread Islam to Madurai. It wasn’t until nearly 250 years later, in 1559, that the structure was rebuilt by the first Nayak king of Madurai. The Meenakshi Amman Temple remains standing today, the tallest tower reaching 170 feet high. The historic temple was even nominated for the New Seven Wonders of the World.",
53,Bahá'í Lotus Temple,"New Delhi, India",A blooming house of worship for the masses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bahai-lotus-temple,"Sprouting as a symbol of beauty and togetherness, the Bahá’í Lotus Temple welcomes all religions and peoples to worship. The pristine white petals of the temple are meant to symbolize folding man and nature into a wholesome oneness. Since its completion in 1986, the Lotus Temple in New Delhi has seen 70 million visitors and is said to be more frequented than the Eiffel Tower and Taj Mahal. Its elegant design has made it the toast of the architectural world, and the peaceful and accepting principles behind its creation have made it a 21st-century monument to interfaith cooperation. Visitors approach the Temple to one of its nine entrances, passing by lush blue-green pools and pristine walkways. After entering the massive temple, visitors find themselves elbow to elbow with a quilt of diversity, who have also come to marvel at the 130-foot-high gathering space that can hold 2,500 people. No matter what your beliefs, a visit to the temple and its 26 acres of tranquil gardens will leave you with a sense of peace and understanding.",
54,India's Giant Technicolor Squirrels,"Bhimashankar, India",These particularly resplendent rodents are the state animal of Maharashtra.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/indian-giant-malabar-squirrel,"If you’re passing below a thick tree canopy in peninsular India and happen to hear a scurrying above you, be sure to look up. You might catch a glimpse of a striking squirrel whose fur appears to have been hand-painted with splashes of brown, orange, maroon, and black. Meet the Malabar giant squirrel, which boasts an all-natural technicolor coat. Also known as shekru, these bright, bushy beauties, which are endemic to India, stretch as much as three feet long—much longer than the eastern gray squirrel and other svelter counterparts. The patchwork fur may help the squirrels hide up in the sun-speckled canopy, which would be an advantage, because they spend most of their lives up there, scampering among the branches and nibbling on flowers, bark, seeds, insects, and bird eggs. Their feathery, charcoal-colored tails help them balance while they teeter on narrow branches or hang straight down to feast. High above the forest floor, they’re out of many predators’ reach—but if they are startled, though (say, by one of their winged predators, like the crested serpent eagle), they plop down flush against the branches, as though trying to melt into them. The cute critter is the state animal of Maharashtra—and if you’re setting out to spot some, your best bet will be in that region’s Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary, tucked among the green, rolling Western Ghats mountain range. The site is also home to one of India’s 12 jyortirlingas, or shrines, dedicated to the god Shiva. Devotees often flock to the temple during monsoon season—an especially wild time to trek through hills tangled with dense, fog-cloaked forests, and dip a toe into the pools at the base of waterfalls. The sanctuary was established in the 1980s and has seen the squirrel population grow since. The animals have popped up on endangered species lists, but a census of the furry residents found that their numbers climbed by eight percent in the sanctuary between 2015 and 2016. Researchers surveyed squirrel nests in the nearby mango, coconut palm, and jamun trees and estimated that there were 2,145 individuals bedding down in the branches there. Each squirrel may build as many as eight nests; in 2017, the sanctuary’s census counts more than 22,000 of them. As an extra boost to the animal’s numbers in the wild, the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Research Centre launched a breeding effort in July 2018. Soon, there may be more of these colorful creatures than ever.","The nearest airport and train station are in Pune.

55,Key Monastery,"Dhar Lama Chung Chung, India",This hilltop warren of monastic dwellings is the result of centuries worth of Mongol attacks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/key-monastery,"Resting snugly within India’s Spiti Valley, the Key Monastery (or Ki, or, Kye, or Kee) looks like a ramshackle temple of mysticism straight out of a fantasy novel, but this Buddhist training ground is actually the result of repeated attacks by Mongol hordes. The exact age of the founding of the Key Monastery is not known but it is believed to originally date back to 1100 CE, although many believe the site is even older. Now sitting on top of a mountain foothill, the early structures built by the original monks would have been much lower. However as the peaceful Buddhists were attacked by the area Mongol barbarians the reconstruction efforts would simply build upon what had gone before, eventually creating the erratic patchwork of rooms, tight hallways, and hidden courtyards that exists today. Much of the monastery bears a distinct Chinese design influence like many similar structures in the area, dating back to a period in the 14th century when the style came to the area. The interiors are also rich with historic murals and documents precious to the orders which have lived in the ever-changing monastery. Today Key Monastery is still a fully-functioning training ground for lamas operated by a Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhist monks. Around 250 monks reside on the site at any given time, training, farming, and generally keeping the thousand-year-old wonder alive.",
56,Chittorgarh Fort,"Chittorgarh, India","A former bastion of Rajput chivalry, this massive hill fort is the site of legend and tragedy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chittorgarh-fort,"Everything about the Chittorgarh hill fort, a rock island that rises steeply from the plains, is on a colossal scale. The half-mile ascent through seven gates takes you almost 500 feet up to a plateau that’s nearly four miles long. The fort covers the entire plateau, encompassing a village, a reservoir, several active temples, and countless deserted, sublimely beautiful ruins. There’s so much to see here, including the remains of ancient palaces, temples, and towers built between the 8th and 16th centuries in a wide variety of architectural styles. Many are shrouded in stories and legends. Near the crumbling 15th-century Palace of Rana Kumbha are the exquisite Meera and Kumbha Shyam Temples. The smaller Meera Temple was built for Princess Meerabai, a 16th-century mystic poet who to this day is considered a legendary figure. After the death of Princess Meerabai’s husband, the crown prince, her in-laws attempted to murder her, but she credited her survival to Lord Krishna’s intervention. Henceforth, she devoted her life to Krishna, and left the palace to wander among the holy men of North India, composing poems and songs that continue to be performed. Other key sites include Padmini’s Palace and the lavishly carved Vijay Stambh, or Tower of Victory, the symbol of Chittorgarh. Visitors can climb to the top, rising over 100 feet up a set of dark narrow stairs. Padmini’s Palace is in a slightly dilapidated state, but you can still stand inside and see the serene pavilion, surrounded by a small pool in the center of the fort, where Sultan Alauddin Khiliji beheld the legendary beauty Rani Padmini in one of the most well-known historical tales in India. In 1303, the infamous warrior king was reputed to have glimpsed Rani Padmini’s reflection in a mirror as she sat on the steps of a pavilion and fell in love with her. From his seat of power in Delhi, he then launched a brutal attack on the kingdom of Chittor to capture her, after betraying Rana Ratan Singh, Rani Padmini’s husband. When defeat was inevitable, the proud Rajput people of Chittor chose to sacrifice their lives, rather than be captured by the invaders. The men rode out into battle and certain death, while 13,000 women and children jumped into a massive funeral pyre, in a practice called jauhar—including Rani Padmini. Amazingly, this policy of death before submission was put to the ultimate test two more times in the history of the Sisodia clan at Chittorgarh. In 1535, Sultan Bahadur Shah besieged the fort, resulting in another ghastly jauhar. The final disaster happened just a few years later when Emperor Akbar took the fort, and again the women and children surrendered their lives in jauhar.","Chittorgarh, also called Chittor Fort, is the largest hill fort in Rajasthan, and to see it all you will cover a distance of 8 miles (13 kilometres). Guides are available. The fort is open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The foreign ticket price is 100 rupees. Domestic tickets are 50 rupees, or 25 rupees for seniors and students. Chittorgarh Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site, part of a group of six hill forts in Rajasthan."
57,Mahila Baag Jhalra,"Jodhpur, India",Hidden in the shadow of a rocky fortress is one concubine’s long-forgotten legacy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mahila-baag-jhalra,"Tourists flock to Jodhpur to see the astonishing Mehrangarh Fort, a 15th-century bastion that looms over the city like a watchful parent. It’s enormous, perched on a hunk of rock that’s always in view. But just a stone’s throw away, another of Jodhpur’s monuments has a much lower profile, quite literally: The 18th-century Mahila Baag Jhalra, a subterranean stepwell that’s so unobtrusive it’s almost impossible to see, even when you’re standing a few feet away. The lovely, multi-layered and multi-hued structure appears in no guidebook, on any tour, or in hardly anyone’s consciousness. But it wasn’t always that way. Stepwells were sophisticated water-harvesting structures built throughout India starting around 600 CE.  There were thousands of them, each providing continual, year-round access to water that fluctuated dramatically between the dry and the rainy seasons. Long flights of steps could reach the ground water at its lowest, and as water rose during monsoons, the steps would submerge, sometimes entirely. This nifty, efficient system continued for over a millennium, gradually waning by the 19th century. Despite their past prominence, stepwells fell completely off history’s grid and today, most are entirely unknown, even within India. Modern water pumps and plumbing rendered these unique subterranean marvels obsolete, and now the vast majority are decrepit, anonymous, often filthy, and generally heartbreaking. Some are well-maintained by the government and attract tourists, but not the graceful Mahila Baag. It lies utterly forlorn just outside the old walls of Jodhpur next to a noisy road, crammed between shops and dwellings, obscured by motorcycles and electrical lines. Passersby are oblivious, and it’s nearly unimaginable that Mahila Baag Jhalra was originally embedded in an elegant garden (baag). The visual chaos and din only add to the excitement of discovery when standing along the edge of this unexpected treasure. A dazzling array of pyramidal stairs is disorienting, as is the experience of looking down into architecture, not up at it as usual. It’s even more disorienting to start the descent, as though entering a drawing by M.C. Escher. You must pick your way carefully among the befuddling combinations of stairs. Paying attention is crucial. The stepwell is allegedly named for Mayla, a beautiful and wealthy concubine who is said to have commissioned it. Through the centuries, Mayla evolved into Mahila, which means “lady” in Hindi, and compared to the brutal-looking fort, this diminutive, inconspicuous structure seems especially dainty. It’s a multi-hued layer cake of stone, built from the pink sandstone seen in so many of Rajasthan’s monuments. There are small pavilions at each corner that were shady retreats in scorching summers when cooling off by the water’s edge must have been appealing. Now, the water is clogged with trash, even though hardy fish can be seen swimming under the surface. Luckily, there’s much to be hopeful for in Jodhpur these days. For hundreds of years the city was renowned for its advanced water harvesting systems, which Mahila Baag Jhalra was part of. Now, the city has again become a hotbed of conservation efforts, with stepwells and other water bodies being revitalized all over the city. Mayla’s garden retreat may yet have its day.

58,Agrasen ki Baoli,"New Delhi, India","A startling, centuries-old subterranean marvel hides in plain sight.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agrasen-ki-baoli,"New Delhi’s Connaught Place is one of the city’s most raucous commercial areas, teeming with locals and tourists alike. Yet just a short walk away down a peaceful residential street, a centuries-old, subterranean marvel hides behind a mundane stone wall in the shadow of modern high-rises. Agrasen ki baoli is a stepwell, otherwise known as “baoli” or “vav”, depending on the region. Thousands of these sophisticated water-harvesting structures proliferated throughout India beginning around 600 CE, but they fell into disuse with the advent of water pumps and plumbing. Flights of steps were excavated adjacent to deep well shafts, ensuring that dramatically-fluctuating ground water could be reached all year long. Today, most stepwells are abandoned and terribly dilapidated, although a relative handful have been restored by the government, as is Agrasen ki baoli. There are still hundreds—perhaps thousands—of these little known subterranean edifices found all over India, whether in remote districts, in small villages, or enormous cities like Delhi, which once boasted a hundred. It’s impossible to describe the experience of walking through an unassuming gateway and being greeted by a vertiginous plunge. Standing at ground level, there are steps cascading four levels into the earth, excavated by hand hundreds of years before the Machine Age. Arched corridors line either side, and at the far end, a stack of dark, faintly ominous openings leads directly into a dry well shaft. This is more than merely a startling view, it’s downright disorienting: We’re used to looking up at architecture, not down into it, which adds to the breathtaking power, not just of Agrasen ki Baoli, but nearly every stepwell. Little factual information about stepwells exists, or is just wildly conflicting, which makes determining construction dates impossible. Such is the case with Agrasen ki baoli, named for a legendary king said to have lived 5,000 years ago, but whose existence has never been proven. The existing structure was probably built in the late 14th century or early 15th century but was restored more recently. One thing is certain: Whatever the stepwell’s origin, it was located far outside the old city of Delhi and would have been a welcome oasis for travelers seeking shelter. The niched corridors running along both sides offered cool retreat with water just a few feet away, so holing up for hours or days would have been inviting. On the other hand, Agrasen ki baoli is considered one of the most haunted places in town, thanks to tales of curses, demons, suicides, and ghosts that often surround stepwells. The deep shadows, dark water, and echo of flapping pigeons can guarantee a creepy atmosphere, but that can change. These days the stepwell is thronged with fans of the 2014 hit movie, PK, in which Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan played an alien. His home? Agrasen ki baoli.

59,Auroville,"Bommayapalayam, India","This experimental utopian ""city of the future"" in rural India may hold a dark secret.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/auroville,"A dozen miles north of Pondicherry, India, there is a town to which you already belong and already have citizenship, and which awaits your arrival. To live there you will need to give up some of the comforts you may have grown accustomed to. No drinking, no smoking, and very little in the way of personal property is allowed here. You can’t own your own house; business and money is communal. Even more than goods, you will have to leave behind ideas: No politics or religion are allowed in this town. Welcome to Auroville, the self-proclaimed “city of the future” and the “city of dawn.” Despite being in a rural region of India, this experimental community was started by a Westerner. The “spiritual companion” of famous Indian independence-fighter, philosopher, and yogi Sri Aurobindo, Mirra Alfassa was a Jewish occultist and spiritualist born to an Egyptian mother and a Turkish father in France. She claimed to have inherited Sri Aurobindo’s spiritual essence upon his death in 1950. Going by the title “The Mother,” Alfassa was worshiped as the female incarnation of the divine, and was the first Westerner to become an Indian guru. Alfassa established Auroville in 1968—a good year for experimental utopias—and on February 28th, 1968, roughly 5,000 people from 124 countries gathered to mix soil from their countries to mark the founding of a town that “belongs to humanity as a whole.” Wanting her community to be a “universal township” meant to exist outside of nations, creeds, politics, religion, and economics—though one could say Auroville has all these things, just of their own making – Alfassa hoped that this new city would help bring Earth to a new consciousness of the “supramental.” Intended to house 50,000, the city centers around a giant golden geodesic dome known as the “Matrimandir” or Mother Temple. Within the golden Mother Temple, silence is absolute, and a spiral ramp leads to “a 70-centimeter crystal ball in a gold mount” as well as a glowing “single ray of sunlight that is directed on the globe from the top of structure.” When there is no sunlight, the beam is faked by a solar-powered light. The neighborhoods of Auroville, with names like Aspiration, Certitude, Discipline, and Grace, are laid out in a swirling spiral galaxy shape. Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of Auroville is the line which it walks between respectability and new-age cultism. While supported by UNESCO and the Indian government, the town also “dynamises” its water by having the water “listen” to Bach and Mozart. And while the town features a Evolution Laboratory – currently the town library— Aurovilians also race through their quiet Utopia on dirt bikes, the preferred mode of transportation. Much more disturbing is that there have also been allegations of abuse of the locals, few of whom become Aurovilians, and tolerance of sexual abuse of local children who live near Auroville by visitors and guests at Auroville. Today, 41 years after its founding and despite its having been designed for 50,000, Auroville is home to only 2,000 or so citizens, though the community comes from a diverse 44 countries. The Mother Temple still remains unfinished, and the town has built few of its proposed structures. Aurovilians seem little worried, though. In their words, “What is more important to Auroville than dates and numbers is the quality of everything, especially the quality and consciousness of its participants.” One can stay as a guest at Auroville by paying a “guest contribution,” or a daily fee. So much for no economics.",
60,Mysore Palace,"Mysore, India","Modest by day, illuminated majestically at sunset.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-majestic-mysore-palace-mysore-india,"In a city famous for its many palaces, the former Royal residence known as Amba Vilas is an exceptionally grand building among grand buildings. It is the fourth palace built on the same location since the beginning of the Wodeyar dynasty in 1399. Designed by the British architect Henry Irwin who designed several other iconic buildings of British India, the palace is a masterpiece of Indo-Saracenic design, which blends together Hindu, Muslim, Rajput, and Gothic styles of architecture. The current palace was designed to be erected on the remains of the earlier palace, which was destroyed by fire at the wedding ceremony of princess Jayalakshmmanni in 1897. Construction was completed in 1912. There are four entrances to the palace, aligned to the cardinal points. Inside, surrounded by tile work and huge pillars, the palace hosts a portrait gallery, an armory, and collections of costume and jewelry. Every fall during the festival of Dasara, the golden royal throne is displayed. At night 97,000 light bulbs transform the building into a glowing spectacle. Though the lighting happens at 7pm, crowds start to grow outside the gate by 6pm to witness light-up. Join the queue about a quarter to 7pm. Though the queue is long, it moves pretty fast. Don’t move your eyes from the palace —the moment of lighting up is a beautiful and superlative sight. Most visitors consist of Indians from outside Mysore, usually in large family groups. A handful of youths roam the site offering to sell sandalwood souvenirs and silver chains, a common occurrence in a region where young children are sent off to work, instead of schools, to meet the daily living demands of families. When entering the palace, visitors are restricted to the residence garden and are able to view the main palace only from a distance. If you’re lucky, you may also catch a live performance by local musicians. If you’re up for a new experience, enjoy a ride on the pony-cart. The driver will take you around the outside of the complete palace and bring you to the main gate. The palace complex also includes twelve Hindu temples. The oldest of these was built in the 14th century, while the most recent was built in 1953.","From Bangalore, take a 3.5 hour cab ride down to Mysore. Mysore Palace is located within the Old Fort. No cameras are allowed beyond a certain point; tourists caught taking pictures will have their cameras confiscated. No shoes are allowed within the palace. The best time to visit the palace is during Dussehra when the entire compound is beautifully decorated and lit in a golden hue. Though Mysore Palace is lit every Sunday to the fact that it remains closed on Sundays, makes it impossible to see it from close. During Dusshera, the entire place is lit and you can enjoy it from up close. Another interesting thing to see in Mysore Palace is the 45 minute light and sound show that depicts the 400 years of history of Mysore city. The light and sound show takes place every evening, except for Sundays and public holidays."
61,Temples of Khajuraho,"Chhatarpur, India","Temples adorned with intricate, erotic sculptures make up one of the ""seven wonders"" of India.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temples-of-kahurajo,"Nestled in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh is a grouping of impressive and very intricately carved temples famous for their depictions of erotic scenes on the outer walls, thus gaining the nickname the Kamasutra Temples. Most of the temples were built by the Chandela dynasty between 950 and 1050 CE. They once covered an area of just over seven miles with 85 temples, but now only 25 spread out over four miles remain. The temples were in active use through the end of 12th century, but that came to an end in the 13th century when the Chandela kingdom was seized by the army of Delhi Sultanate. The area where the temples resided remained in Muslim control through the 18th century. During this time period the temples were subject to abuse, destruction and neglect. Over the centuries, due to Khajuraho’s remoteness, the jungle reclaimed the area and the temples were mostly forgotten. In the 1830s the temples were rediscovered by British surveyor T.S. Burt with the help of locals. The temples are most well known for their erotically carved sculptures, but upon arrival it becomes more of a Where’s Waldo activity to find these salacious scenes. Less than 10% of the sculptures are erotic in nature and they are known as Kama scenes. Kama literally means “desire, wish, longing” and is one of the four goals of human life in Hindu traditions; it is considered an essential human pursuit in balance with the other three goals: Dharma, Artha and Moksha. All goals of human life are represented at the Khajuraho Temples along with scenes of day to day life of medieval India, such as farming, playing music, and making pottery. It’s possible that the Kama scenes are tantric in nature but more likely it’s an homage to human life and actively. Whether one comes to peek at the adult content, admire the incredible art and engineering, or stroll around the lush grounds, it’s well worth the time to make the journey.",
62,Kalavantin Durg,"Sangtoli, India",A centuries-old lookout post still sits atop a natural stone spire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kalavantin-durg,"When nature gives you a 2,300-foot stone spire, it’s time to make a strategic lookout. At least that must have been the logic behind the ancient Kalavantin Durg. Nothing more than a small cave built into the summit of a towering spike of rock, the fort, built around 530 BC, nonetheless gives a perfect view of the surrounding Indian lands. The fort is only accessible by ascending thousands of hand-carved steps, known as the “Climb to Heaven,” which rise at a dizzyingly steep angle to the top of the spire. While no one is sure of the true origins of the fort or its name, tradition holds that the lookout was named after a princess, although there is no evidence to support this. The fort no longer holds any military significance, but it still attracts waves of foreign visitors each year who want to brave the treacherous steps up to the top.",
63,Mayong - The Land of Black Magic,"Mayang, India",The Indian capital of black magic and witchcraft.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mayong-the-land-of-black-magic,"In northeastern India, there is a city with a mythological history even deeper than the Brahmaputra River that runs through it. Nicknamed “The Land of Black Magic,” the untouched, secluded village of Mayong holds one of the oddest magical backstories on the planet. While some villages pass down the skills of farming or craftsmanship to the next generation, the elders of Mayong pass down sorcery and magic to the town’s youth. Many speculate that the name “Mayong” originated from the Sanskrit word “maya”, which means “illusion”. This certainly seems to be the case in Mayong, where, according to legend, people have been morphed into animals, monstrous beasts have been tamed, and men have disappeared into thin air by uttering “Luki Mantra.” Mayong has been India’s center for witchcraft and wizardry since its inception many centuries ago. In the early days of Mayong, legend has it, if you chanted “Uran Mantra” you would be able to fly through the air and land directly beside your true love. According to legend, witches and the saints of black magic took shelter in the Mayong woods years ago. In 1337, Muhammad Shah’s army of 100,000 horsemen perished at the hands of witchcraft in a location near Mayong, evidence to the village’s locals of the high prevalence of black magic in the area. Excavators have even found swords in Mayong that resemble those used to sacrifice humans in other parts of India. Mayong today is just as dark and eerie, but slightly more open, with the occasional traveller passing through town. The locals of Mayong offer palm reading to these visitors and claim to be able to predict the future with the help of broken glass and seashells. Witch doctors are also abundant in Mayong. Local healers treat pain by placing a copper dish on the source of the injury and wait for the dish to “eat away” the pain. If the pain is too severe, the dish will overheat and shatter onto the ground. The witch doctors also serve as a lost and found in the town. If someone loses something, the witch doctor will place a flower in a metal bowl. According to the locals, the bowl will then move along the ground, completely on its own, until it reaches the location of the lost or stolen items. There are a countless number of spells in Mayong, but, according to mythology, none of them have the power to change the weather. Says Naba Deka, a local to the area, “there are spells to turn a leaf into a fish, or an evil man into an animal, but magic cannot fight against nature’s fury, so there is no spell against the annual floods.” Every year, a handful of Indians travel to Mayong either to practice dark magic and learn the secrets of witchcraft or to visit the adjacent Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, which hosts the world’s densest population of Indian rhinos. In fact, the animals and magic of Mayong often go hand in hand. This can be seen at the Mayong-Pobitora Festival, which celebrates the fusion between wildlife and sorcery.",
64,Mehrangarh Fort,"Jodhpur, India",This stunning 15th-century royal hill fort preserves the age of chivalry in Rajasthan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mehrangarh-fort,"One of the best-preserved and largest forts in India, the Mehrangarh Fort towers 400 feet above the city of Jodhpur. Founded in 1459 by Rajput leader Rao Jodha of the Rathore clan, it is owned and managed by the Jodhpur royal family to this day. You can see the palatial hill fort from just about everywhere in the city, its distinctive walls soaring above the rocky plateau from which they were carved. Mehrangarh means “fort of the sun,” referring to the myth that the Jodhpur royal family descended from the sun god, Surya. A visit to Mehrangarh Fort takes hours, and it’s worth every minute. Here, you can experience the history of war, the culture of honor, and the life of extravagance that Rajput royals enjoyed. After the long walk from the city up to the fort (you can also take a taxi or rickshaw), you enter through the main gate, and continue to walk up a ramp through a series of seven gates. At a gate called Loha Pol, iron spikes are embedded in the wood (to prevent an elephant attack) and a set of small red hand prints on the wall memorialize a horrifying historic event. These are the handprints of the wives of Maharaja Man Singh’s widows, left there as they went to throw themselves on his funeral pyre in 1843. Inside the fort, the royal palaces now serve as the Mehrangarh Museum. You can walk from one to another, through enclosed courtyards adorned with lattice work and charming balconies. The former palaces are filled with antiques, artifacts, and art works, and even complete rooms. You will find miniature paintings, palanquins, howdahs (elephant seats), textiles, weaponry, and household goods. One room houses a collection of elaborate royal cradles from the 17th century. In the former bedroom of Maharaja Takhat Singh, also known as the Sheesh Mahal (Hall of Mirrors), every inch covered in painted panels, carvings, tiles, and mirrors.","Open every day, 9 am to 5 pm.

Opened in 1767 and used actively until the 1830s, the eight-acre necropolis is enclosed by a high brick wall which protects the eclectic mix of tombs, cenotaphs, and mausoleums. The nearly 1900 graves represent a melting pot of design influences from European gothic to classical antiquity to Indo-Saracenic styles all jumbled up in a maze of obelisks, cairns, urns, and sarcophagi. A number of the graves belong to famous military and political figures of the time, including Sir William Jones, founder of the Asiatic Society, whose towering memorial obelisk is the tallest of the structures in the graveyard. While South Park Street Cemetery is undergoing constant upkeep and renovations, the rich tropical surroundings continue to encroach on the mouldering stones. Green mosses and prehistoric ferns cover much of the grounds making for a haunting setting for visitors looking for a little history in their boneyards.",At the intersection of Mother Teresa Sarani (Park Street) and Lower Circular Road

Spread over five districts, Nalgonda, Mahaboobnagar, Kurnool, Prakasam and Guntur, Nagarjunasagar is much more than a big cat sanctuary. Krishna River, the oldest river in the country, flows through 130 km of the reserve and its impressive reservoirs are vital sources of irrigation and energy for much of its state of residence. Practical uses aside, the river provides stunning views and waterfalls, kept constantly raging by two monsoon seasons that are active the majority of the year. Long before the site became a safe space for the animals, it stood as the ancient Buddhist town of Nagarjuna Viswa Vidyalayam, watched over by Buddhist scholar Nāgārjuna in 150 A.D. Ruins of the long-dead place of learning still scatter a section of the landscape, mixed in with 3rd century forts of the Kakatiya dynasty that line the banks of the Krishna. Renamed as Rajiv Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary in 1992, the sanctuary was was notified in 1978, becoming a ward of Project Tiger in 1983. At that time, the reserve had been being used as an exclusive hunting ground for royalty, and had been ravaged by poaching, fires, and general lack of conservation practices, leaving the tiger count at a meager 80 cats. Fire lines, salt licks, and several other improvements allowed that number to grow to 94 within 6 years, and while extremist activity in the area has made present numbers impossible to pin down, the sanctuary currently houses (among other animals) Bengal tigers, sloth Bears, Indian Pangolins, mugger crocodiles, Indian pythons, and Indian peafowl.",
67,Stepped Tanks of Hampi,"Hampi, India",The ancient water tanks remain some of the ruined city’s most beautiful architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stepped-tanks-pushkarani-hampi,"The ruins of Hampi, once a grand city in the Indian state of Karnataka, were once home to more than 250,000 people in the Vijayanagar Empire, and filled with Hindu temples. The abandoned city is now dotted with hundreds of individual ruins, home to countless architectural wonders. Among the most beautiful ruins of Hampi are the pushkarnis, ancient water tanks. Like many Hindu temples in India, Hampi’s majestic temples have accompanying stepped tanks or basins used for religious and ceremonial purposes. Though thousands of miles away, water in the pushkarnis was considered part of the Ganges, Hinduism’s most sacred river, and therefore sacred. The pushkarnis all follow a similar architectural form, designed symmetrically as either rectangles or squares. Each generally has several large tiers which contain multiple steps in semi-pyramidal from, leading down to the next level. Many of the pushkarnis were surrounded by pillars, like those at the Pattabhirama Temple, all of which added to the sense of grandeur. These sacred tanks were integral parts of each temple complex. The stepped tanks were used for ritual bathing and cleansing before prayers. They also performed important ritualistic functions for festivals. At the end of Ganesh Chaturthi, the festival celebrating Ganesh, the idol of the god must be submerged in water in order to ritualistically dispose of it, a practice known as visarjan. The steps carved into the sides of each pushkarni allowed for worshippers to easily get in and out of the water. The pushkarnis were fed with the water of the nearby Tungabhadra River through a series of canals and aqueducts. While some, like the tank at the Krishna Temple, are no longer functional, others still receive some water through the ancient water systems.",
68,Jaisalmer Fort,"Jaisalmer, India",The oldest still-inhabited hill fort in India looks like a magnificent golden sandcastle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jaisalmer-fort,"Jaisalmer Fort, like much of the city, is made from the golden-hued Jurassic sandstone of the region, and the effect is enchanting. From a distance, it looks like a golden sandcastle rising from the remote desert of western Rajasthan. But it is also a living fort, with about 3,000 inhabitants living within the complex. The Jaisalmer Fort is the second-oldest fort in the state of Rajasthan, and the oldest continuously inhabited fort in India. It was built on a hill in the 12th century by Rajput ruler Rawal Jaisal. The double-fortified ramparts and circular bastions are incorporated into the stunning architectural design for extra protection during defense and battle. Jaisalmer is on the edge of India, very near the Pakistan border, but it wasn’t always off the beaten path. Centuries ago, it was at the crossroads of several important trade routes, including the ancient Silk Road. Rich merchants built intricately carved havelis in the fort, adding to the beauty and charm of the “Golden City.” A paved road takes you from the city up a ramp into the fort, through four huge gateways to Dushera Chowk, presided over by the beautifully carved Palace of the Maharawal, the former home of the monarch. The palace was turned into a museum and visitors can wander among the painted and tiled rooms, and up to the roof, the highest point in the fort, which offers stunning views. The view from the Palace of the Maharawal, as well as other rooftops in Jaisalmer Fort, reveals the maze of narrow, twisting lanes that honeycomb through this ancient edifice. It’s a joy and delight to wander among them, letting yourself get lost. Residents share the confined space with several impressive Jain and Hindu temples, endless souvenir shops selling Rajasthani crafts such as puppets and textiles, guest houses and boutique hotels for every budget, cafes and restaurants, and, the fort museum itself. Jaisalmer Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site, part of a group of six hill forts in Rajasthan. But unlike most other forts, Jaisalmer is a living city that both preserves the past and thrives in the present.","Unfortunately, the tourist boom combined with water shortages in this desert location have added to the deterioration of the fort. Modern plumbing piped water into the fort, causing a leak that undermined the foundations. Several bastions collapsed and the fort was in jeopardy. Since then, conservation groups have repaired the damage, improved drainage, and fortified the structure, which though no longer in imminent jeopardy is still fragile. Visitors should use a minimum amount of water."
69,College Street,"Kolkata, India",The world's largest secondhand book market is a haven for bibliophiles and bargain hunters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/college-street,"Kolkata’s historic College Street is India’s largest book market, lending it the endearing nickname Boi Para–”Book Town.” As the name suggests, College Street is lined by many of Kolkata’s academic institutions: the University of Calcutta, Sanskrit College, Presidency University, the Medical College of Kolkata, to name a few. When these institutions were established in the 19th century, they turned the stretch of road between Mahatma Gandhi Road crossing and Bowbazar crossing into a veritable haven for the city’s intelligentsia. With an area spanning almost one million square feet, College Street is also the largest secondhand book market in the world. The mile-long avenue is dotted with hundreds of bookstores, big and small, and is also home to India’s biggest publishing houses. The bookstores range from standard brick-and-mortar affairs to small makeshift stalls made from bamboo, canvas, or sheets of metal. Each stall and store has its own history to speak of. College Street’s main draw is that it boasts a collection of almost every single title to ever have been sold in Kolkata. Rare books are sold at dirt cheap prices, and extensive bargaining is the order of the day. One can find books dating back 250 years, rare first editions as well as copies of books from publishers that have ceased to exist today. One of the literati staples on College Street is the famed Indian Coffee House, which has seen notable Indian writers such as the likes of Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray stop in for a cup of chai, a samosa, and the weekly gossip. When perusing the stores on College Street, be sure to browse carefully: you might find a first edition Dickens nestled among the latest John Grisham thrillers.","College Street is accessible by car, metro, bus or tram.

70,Murud Janjira fort,"Raigad, India",A nearly unconquerable island-fort in the Indian Ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/murud-janjira-fort,"In the late 1200s, the Koli or “fisherman kings” built the first fort off the coast of Maharastra on a rocky island in the Arabian Sea. However the island had a hidden advantage, in the middle of the fort was a well which supplied the fort with fresh non-salty drinking water. With water to drink and fish to eat, the island-fort was extremely difficult to conquer. For over 200 years, the Indian fisherman fought off attacks from invading Muslim armies, until a Trojan Horse-style raid – in which soldiers pretended to be liquor merchants, hid in barrels of booze and got the Koli soldiers drunk before attacking – by the Habashi finally overthrew the fisherman kings. When the British Empire expanded into India, the English tried to take the fort, but were also unsuccessful. The Brits signed a treaty with the Siddis – a Sufi Muslim group of African descent who received authority of the island from the Habashi – that the fort would remain under local rule, a sole independent outpost in all of colonial India. When India gained independence in 1947, the island was united with the state of Bombay. Open to tourists, the island is now accessible from either the Rajpuri port or the Murud port by sailboat. On the 22-acre island, the ancient forts and ruined castles can be explored, as can the islands beautiful beach. According to a recent visitor the well is still filled with “cold and sweet water.”",
71,Cafe Lota,"New Delhi, India","Nestled among the artifacts of the National Crafts Museum, this hidden gem offers hard-to-find regional foods from all over India.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cafe-lota,"The ancient art in New Delhi’s National Museum may get all the credit, but if you want a truly multisensory tour of India, the National Crafts Museum’s Cafe Lota is the place to go. For decades after its establishment in the 1950s, the Crafts Museum, despite its stunning collection of textiles, sculptures, and other handicrafts, was largely neglected. Since 2013, the museum has experienced a renaissance, thanks largely to the opening of its cafe. Nestled in the museum’s courtyard among replicated village scenes built by craftspeople from all over India, Cafe Lota serves hard-to-find regional specialties, using often-overlooked traditional grains to showcase the ingenuity of the country’s diverse cuisines. Upon entering the courtyard, visitors are greeted by rows of terra cotta horses, made by craftspeople especially for the museum. The horses guard a Village Complex, built in 1972 for the Asia Trade Fair and since relocated to the museum premises. Consisting of 15 different structures, including houses and shrines, the Village Complex was created by regional craftsmen using materials sourced from those areas. The courtyard walls showcase murals in indigenous styles from all over India, including a Mithila painting from Bihar and a painting from the indigenous Santhal people of Jharkand and West Bengal. Inside, visitors can see examples of the over 30,000 artifacts in the museum’s collection, including rare handwoven saris from the 19th century and gold and silver work. They can also look out for the museum’s artist residency for traditional craftspeople as well as periodic interactive sessions and cultural events, including dance and music performances. But the real star of the show is in the courtyard itself: Cafe Lota. Built to resemble a typical outdoor roadside restaurant or dhaba, the cafe is open-air, shaded by a roof of dried natural materials. The menu embodies the same authenticity, using local grains such as ragi or millet to re-create dishes from India’s vastly diverse regional cuisines. The menu includes traditional dishes such as Uttarakhand indigenous black bean curry with bhaang or hemp chutney (don’t worry: it’s not psychoactive) and playful fusion food, such as amaranth-crusted Amritsari-spiced “fish and chips.” In an increasingly standardized culinary culture, where industrial crops such as wheat and rice have overtaken traditional regional grains, Cafe Lota and the Crafts Museum remind visitors of the diversity and ingenuity of India’s farmers, craftspeople, and cooks.","The cafe is indoor-outdoor, with a natural ceiling and plenty of fans giving the space a breezy feel. The restaurant, however, doesn't have air conditioning, so the faint of heart (or sweat gland) may not be comfortable going at midday from May to July. Try going for dinner when the asphalt-melting summer heat has cooled down—or wait for a beautiful, breezy Delhi winter day."

73,Karni Mata Temple,"Deshnok, India","Deep in the Thar desert, a temple crawling with thousands of holy rats.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karni-mata-temple,"According to legend, the rat temple near Bikaner dates back to the 1400s, when Karni Mata, an incarnation of the god Durga, asked the death-god Yoma to reincarnate the son of a grieving storyteller. When death refused to help, Karni Mata promised that all-male storytellers—members of the Charan caste—would be reincarnated as rats in her temple. When they die as rats, they are once more reincarnated as members of the Depavats family, as Karni Mata’s descendants are known. While the origins of rat-worship in India go back to the 15th century, the current temple, with its intricate marble panels and solid silver carvings, was built in the early 1900s to honor Karni Mata and her furry, reincarnated devotees. The temple has around 20,000 rats in residence, who are fed by members of the extended Depavats family—there are 513 Depavats families and devotees to Karni Mata. Though most of the temple-devotees work at the temple in shifts based on the lunar cycle, some families live in the temple permanently, taking care of the rats and sweeping the floor of excrement and food crumbs. The rats, known as “kabbas” or “little children,” are fed grains, milk, and coconuts shells from large metal bowls. Water the rats drink from is considered holy, and eating the rats’ leftovers is said to bring good fortune to those making the pilgrimage to the temple. The devotees have another reason to keep the rats safe and happy: according to the temple laws, if one of the rats is accidentally killed, it must be replaced with a rat made of silver or gold. But there is a bittersweet note to the whole affair. All the sweet foods, the fighting between rats, and the sheer number of animals living in the temple make them prone to diseases. Stomach disorders and diabetes are extraordinarily common among the rats, and every few years a rat epidemic decimates the population. Luckily, despite the dangers to the rats themselves, there are no recorded cases of humans contracting a disease from the temple rats. Shoes are not allowed in the temple, and it’s considered very auspicious for a rat to run over your feet, or for a visitor to glimpse an albino rat, of which there are only four or five out of the twenty thousand. To see the temple in full glory, visitors should come late at night or before sunrise, when the rats are out in full force, gathering food. Remember that only rats within the temple walls are thought to be reincarnated and therefore sacred. The rats in the town are just, well, rats.","A 40-minute drive south from Bikaner. One of the best occasions to visit the Temple is during the Karni Mata Fair. Also known as Karni Mata Festival or Karni Mate Mela is held twice a year from March-April, then from September-October. During the celebrations, the statue of the goddess Karni Mata is beautifully decorated with a golden crown, jewelry, and garlands."
74,Gol Gumbaz,"Vijayapura, India",This 17th-century mausoleum is topped with an acoustic marvel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gol-gumbaz,"Gol Gumbaz is a fabulously imposing structure, towering 51 meters above the surrounding city of Vijayapura and representing one of the most important examples of late-medieval Indo-Islamic architecture. Meaning “circular dome”, it is appropriate that this mausoleum is most famous for its massive crowning feature — which is not only architecturally impressive, but also houses a sonic funhouse. With a diameter of 44 meters, the dome of Gol Gumbaz ranks among the largest domes of the pre-modern world and is supported by a series of interlocking arches without any columns. A balcony rings around the interior of the dome, creating the so-called “whisper gallery” where any sound, loud or quiet, is amplified and carried throughout the cavernous space, ringing off the concave walls and echoing back a dizzying number of times. In the dim twilight of the gallery’s interior, hovering 33 meters above the main chamber below, the effect is truly surreal. Gol Gumbaz was built as a mausoleum for Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, the seventh ruler of the Adil Shahi dynasty and head of the Bijapur sultanate. Construction began shortly after he ascended the throne in 1627 and apparently was not yet fully completed by the time he died in 1656, when work finally stopped. Its massive single chamber covers 1,700 square meters and sits atop a basement tomb containing the remains of sultan, as well as those of his two wives, his mistress, his daughter and his grandson. Each corner of the building is graced by a seven-story-tall minaret containing stairs that provide access to the whispering gallery.","Get there very early in the morning so that you can enjoy the whispering gallery, when you have the place all to yourself."
75,Nahoum and Sons,"Kolkata, India","This Jewish bakery, among the last in the region, sells legendary sweets from a century-old storefront.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nahoum-sons-kolkata-jewish-bakery,"At the turn of the 20th century, Nahoum Israel Mordecai moved from the Middle East to Kolkata. He was part of a community of more than 4,000 other Jewish people from Syria and Iraq, called Baghdadi Jews, who had flourished along trade routes in India since the Mughal Empire. They brought their faith, their culture, and, in some cases, their talent for baking. Nahoum was one of the community’s most talented confectioners. In 1902, he began selling baked goods and cheese door to door. In 1916, he formally opened Nahoum and Sons bakery. More than a century later, the dark wood counter of Nahoum and Sons’ original New Market location continues to groan under the weight of sweets. Bengalis are famous sweet makers and eaters, and their milk-based mishti are a dream of sweet syrups and fried dairy. Nahoum and Sons’ sweets are a bit different than conventional Bengali fare, mixing Western staples such as brownies and cream puffs with Jewish and Middle Eastern confections, such as challah bread and baklava. Some sweets at Nahoum’s, such as savory caraway cookies known as kakas, are signatures of the Baghdadi Jewish community. Others, like the bakery’s coconut and cheese samosas, are pure fusion, the result of a marriage of traditions and flavors common to this once-colonial capital. Today, Nahoum and Sons is one of Kolkata’s last Jewish cultural institutions. The city’s Jewish community has dwindled to around 20 people. Many of Kolkata’s Jews fled following independence in 1947, uncertain what an independent India would bring. Meanwhile, the 2013 death of the founder’s grandson had loyalists wondering whether the bakery would be shut for good. Luckily, another family member took over the business, and it remains strong. Tradition has served the bakery well over the years: Although owners just recently began accepting credit cards, they continue to use the wooden money till that has collected dough (of the financial kind) for the past hundred years. Even though the community’s numbers have declined significantly, Nahoum and Sons remains a testimony to the pluralistic history of India. One slice of the bakery’s lemon tart, and you’ll understand why this institution has weathered the test of time.","Nahoum's is popular among sweet-lovers year round, but perhaps never so much as before Christmas. Head to New Market a few days before the holiday to witness (and indulge in) a sugary rush. Be sure to indulge in a bit of Nahoum's famous fruitcake—the Archbishop of Canterbury said it's the best he's ever had."

The residential structures remain, old houses, a church, a bazaar, stores, a large swimming pool, and a small hospital, though their brick is slowly being overtaken by the roots of wild Ficus plants. The island was named after surveyor, Sir Daniel Ross, and was inhabited initially in 1788-89 after Archibald Blair’s survey of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Owing to inclement weather conditions, however, the mortality rate was very high and the settlement was soon abandoned. In 1887 it was repopulated, following a resolution to set up a jail and penal colony there under British administration, following a number of uprisings by Indians. The island was continuously inhabited and controlled by the British until March 1942, when Japanese troops invaded and took control of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands including Ross. Remnants of bunkers constructed by the Japanese remain. When WWII came to a close, the island was once again under the control of the British and following the independence of India, was transferred to the Indian government. Ross Island was uninhabited by either Japanese or British at that time and remained so until 1979 when the island was handed over to the Indian Navy. A small base named INS Jarawa was subsequently established. In 1993, a museum was also set up on the island. Today the island is open to visitors, and contains several brick walkways crisscrossing the settlement. They’re a number of small shops with water and food supplies, and ferries run every hour or so from Port Blair, the main outpost of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. As it is also a navy controlled territory, visitors are required to sign-in upon entry and exit, and the island is closed to tourists at night.","About 2km south from Port Blair, the chief settlement of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Visitors too Ross must leave the island before 5 p.m."
77,Fatehpur Sikri,"Fatehpur Sikri, India","An imperial fortress city that incorporated cultural elements from the entire Mughal empire, only to be abandoned the year it was finished.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fatehpur-sikri,"This magnificent and abandoned fortified city of Fatehpur Sikri was built for the Mughal Emperor Akbar. It was the capital of the Mughal empire from 1571 to 1585, and is considered the best example of Mughal architecture in existence. Akbar himself oversaw the construction of the fortress, ensuring that every detail of the city was befitting of an emperor’s grandeur. Unfortunately, the fortress was abandoned as soon as it was finished. The grand city was comprised of several palatial courts, a harem building, a mosque, private emperor’s quarters, residential buildings, the tomb of a Sufi saint, a giant outdoor board game, a pool, and utility buildings. These were colored a rosy hue by the local red sand used as construction material. Fatehpur Sikri is also notable for the fact that it incorporated the many cultures of the Mughal empire—the name, as well as the geometric layout, drew on ancient Persian influences, whereas the buildings’ decorative embellishments were classically Indian. Akbar was known for his tolerance of multi-religious culture, and the inhabitants of the city followed Islam, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity without conflict. Not long after the fortress was completed, the lake that provided water to the complex dried up, and life at Fatehpur Sikri was unsustainable. Emperor Muhammad Shah lived in the city between 1719 and 1748, and the Marathas warriors occupied the city for a short time after that. Once the British invaded India, their army used the fortress as a barracks, during which time it was badly damaged. What remains of Fatehpur Sikri is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A town has grown up to the west of the ruins, and still uses the mosque for worship. Archaeological excavation has indicated that the significance of the site dates way earlier than Emperor Akbar and Fatehpur Sikri. Thousand-year-old Jain statues and buildings have been unearthed beneath the city, suggesting that some lost culture existed there prior to the Mughals. One of the intriguing structures at Fatehpur Sikri is known as Panch Mahal. Panch Mahal means “five-story high royal pavilion”.  As the name suggests, it consists of a five-story frame pavilion made of red sandstone. The open floor plan allows it to serve as a transition building between the traditional masonry structure on one side and an open plaza on the other. Panch Mahal‘s frame structure and open-plan became a part of modernist architect Le Corbusier’s architectural grammar.  Panch Mahal’s contribution as a precursor to modern architecture is not often recognized in the History of Architecture.  However, it must be recognized as a pioneer of modernism in architecture.",
78,Kapaleeshwarar Temple,"Chennai, India",The painted and decorated towers of this Hindu shrine were once the tallest structures in one of the oldest cities in India.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kapaleeshwarar-temple,"The coastal south Indian city of Chennai is one of the oldest in the country, part of the Madras Presidency during British rule. But Mylapore, a neighborhood of Chennai, even predates the city itself, with historical records from the area dating back to the first century BCE. Mylapore derives its name from the Tamil word mayil, meaning peacock, from a time when dancing peacocks were a common sight there. Today the peacocks have been replaced by motor vehicles, and maritime traders replaced by modern commercial establishments. But Mylapore still stands, as does its cultural and religious center, the Kapaleeshwarar temple. The temple is a shrine to the Hindu god Shiva and his consort Parvati and is one the of the busiest in the city, drawing both pilgrims and tourists. The original temple was constructed by rulers of the Pallava dynasty, and was located closer to the seashore. After that was destroyed, the current temple was built over 300 years ago in the traditional architectural style that includes a gopuram or a painted and intricately carved tower gateway, a central shrine surrounded by smaller ones, and a massive temple tank. The tank, whose walls are painted in the holy colors of red and white, has a central platform around which a barge makes its way during the annual festival of Thai Poosam, which celebrates the season’s abundant rainfall that fills the tank. Another major festival is the Arubathimoovar, where the temple’s deities and saints are placed on decorated chariots and taken in procession around the temple. Mylapore, always buzzing with activity, transforms into a whirlwind of faces, flowers, food, and music during the annual festivals. The temple and tank are surrounded by four streets that are, today, home to both big stores and small stalls selling flowers and knick-knacks. The maada streets, as they’re called locally, are a good place to pick up traditional clothes and jewelry, and artifacts made of silver and brass. The small chaotic side streets are also full of local outlets serving snacks like pakodas or vegetable fritters, polis or sugar-coated crepes, and the trademark extra-strong filter coffee. A walk around Mylapore is a great way to experience the ethos of an ancient south Indian temple and the commerce and ecosystem that surround it.","Mylapore and the temple are easily accessible by road, though parking can be a problem around the temple. Men who drive the local black and yellow autos are very familiar with the area and can be directed using terms like 'Mylapore Tank' and 'Kabali kovil'.
It is also well-connected by public buses, and the MRTS train system."
79,Adalaj Ni Vav,"Adalaj, India",A deeply beautiful 15th-century stepwell with a tragic story.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adalaj-ni-vav,"Adalaj ni vav (stepwells are called vavs in the Indian state of Gujarat) is a beautiful structure, descending five stories deep. It was built in 1499 to hold water, provide refuge to travelers and local people, and offer spiritual sustenance. The fifth floor is especially stunning, and from here you can see the deep turquoise waters of the well itself, which seems to glow with inner light, surrounded by astonishing beauty captured forever in stone. The stepwell’s immense beauty is not the only thing spectacular about it. The tale of its creation is full of love and war, devotion and betrayal. Hindu King Rana Veer Singh started construction of the Adalaj ni vav to provide relief to his people in this arid region, who had to walk miles for water. However, before it was finished, he entered into a war with neighboring Muslim King Mehmud Begada. King Rana Veer Singh was killed in battle, and King Mehmud Begada fell in love with his widow, the beautiful Queen Roopba (aka Queen Rudabai). Queen Roopba agreed to marry King Mehmud Begada—but only on the condition that he finish the stepwell her husband had started. King Mehmud Begada agreed, which is why the stepwell design—built in Solanki style of architecture and adorned with Hindu and Jain images—also shows Islamic influences. When it was finished, Queen Roopba threw herself in to the well, and died. Apparently, she had no intention of marrying King Mehmud—she just wanted to see her husband’s stepwell finished. Luckily for us, King Mehmud did not destroy the structure or the Hindu ornamentation, and it remains intact more than 500 years later. The entire structure is covered with carvings, sculptures, and ornamentation, combining Indo-Islamic architectural elements and designs. Islamic floral patterns blend seamlessly with Hindu and Jain symbolism, and carved scenes of everyday life, such as women churning butter. Hindu and Jain gods also adorn the walls, and to this day, the stepwell serves as a temple. It’s not uncommon to see flower offerings. Adalaj ni vav is unique in that it is the only stepwell with three sets of entrance stairs. They all meet on the first level down, at a large square platform. As you continue to descend, down to the fifth story, the air grows noticeably cooler. The stepwell was built to keep the harsh sunlight out, and provide a cool refuge for local people and travelers. There is a lot of room for people to gather on each level, and no doubt travelers would have spent the night here—back in the days before hotels. The small town of Adalaj was on a trade route, and would have seen many travelers pass by.","Adalaj Ni Vav is in Adalaj village, near Gandhinagar, Gujarat state capital, and about 18 kilometres from Ahmedabad, Gujarat's largest city. You can either take a taxi, take an auto-rickshaw, or catch a bus for Gandhinagar. The stepwell is open from 6 am to 6 pm, and there is an entry fee of Rs. 25 (US$ 0.35) for Indian and SAARC nationals, and of Rs. 300 (US$4) for other nationals."

At about 8,000 feet above sea level, this is the highest tea estate in the world. Known for its excellent, flavorsome teas, this estate is also known for its panoramic views and the for the rugged mountains that surround it. It’s remote - it takes about 90 minutes to reach Kolukkumalai from Munnar - but on clear nights, you can see Kodaikanal from the estate because of its height. “The rejuvenating fresh air is a blessing in this place, but life is very simple,” one review from a visitor reads. “Their world revolves around their homes and work.” The factory at the center of the estate has stood for several generations, having been built more than 70 years ago. It uses traditional techniques even today that serve as a draw for tea enthusiasts. Orthodox tea-making is a seven-step process that includes withering, rolling, sieving, fermenting, drying, fiber extraction, and grading. All of this work happens in the small factory that has not been changed since the British constructed it in the 1930s. The estate was the 2005 Southern Tea Competition winner of the Golden Leaf India Awards.",Munnar is connected to other cities in Kerala and Tamil Nadu by state government public transport buses. Many tour providers arrange packaged bus tours to Munnar from Cochin. The charges will be about Rs 1000 per head.
81,Ranthambore Fort,"Ranthambhore Fort, India","The evocative ruins of a 1,000-year-old hill fort lie within a popular tiger reserve.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ranthambore-fort,"Ranthambore National Park is one of the most popular tiger reserves in India, but it’s not just wildlife enthusiasts who enter the busy park on a daily basis. A living temple on the grounds attracts religious pilgrims; nature lovers enjoy the beauty of the landscape; and history buffs are drawn to the ruins of a 10th century fort, a colossal citadel founded in 944 by the Chauhan Rajputs. The land occupied by the national park was once used by the Rajput rulers of Jaipur as private hunting grounds. Today, the crumbling Ranthambore Fort in the center of the park is an attraction of its own, set dramatically on a sheer cliff on Thambhore Hill, and surrounded by a verdant forest dotted with decaying pavilions, palaces, lakes, and ponds. The majestic fort is situated atop a 700-foot-high hill, bounded by an enormous stone wall inset with bastions and turrets. It extends over 4 miles and encloses an area of nearly 2.5 miles. Inside, the complex is filled with many ruins and architectural marvels. Palaces, cenotaphs, tanks, pavilions, and temples are scattered among a network of lanes and courtyards. It is considered a fine example of a forest hill fort, and the remains of the Hammir palace are among the oldest Indian surviving palaces. Though the Ranthambore Fort was believed an impregnable defense in its time, the citadel was attacked twice. It was stormed by Sultan Alauddin Khilji’s army in 1299, because the Chauhan King, Hammir Deo, gave shelter to one of the sultan’s enemies. Even though Khilji sent 80,000 cavalry and a large infantry to attack the fort, they were repulsed, and their commander was killed. In 1568, Mughal Emperor Akbar lead a massive attack on the fort, with about 70,000 troops. As Rajputs were often sworn enemies of the Mughals, the emperor had captured several other Rajput forts in Rajasthan. After a siege of more than a month, Hindu leader Rai Surjan Hada of Ranthambore Fort surrendered to the Emperor Akbar. Today, the site is open to park visitors on wildlife safaris or those who come to see the fort alone. It’s possible to drive a private car to the fort parking lot and walk about 200 steps up to the top of the hill. From there, the expansive views of the park are magnificent, and you can see soaring vultures, eagles, and other birds at virtually eye level.","The fort can be visited during a wildlife safari to Ranthambore National Park, between October to June. The park is open to visitors between 6:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and between 2 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Admission to the fort (though not the national park) is free."
82,Sati Handprints,"Jodhpur, India",Fifteen Jodhpur queens left their handprints before going to their fiery death.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sati-handprints,"The entrance to the imposing Mehrangarh Fort is guarded by a series of seven famous gates. To the left of innermost gate, Loha Pol, or “Iron Gate”, are 15 small handprints left by the wives of the maharaja before they immolated themselves on his funeral pyre. Known as sati marks, the gilded handprints most likely date back to the 1843 death of Maharaja Man Singh. The custom of sati has ancient origins in the Hindu faith, and was practiced widely in the Rajasthan area. Wives were dressed in wedding finery to join their husbands in death as an act of devotion and faith, usually within a day of his death. In 1731, following the death of Maharaja Ajit Singh six wives and fifty-eight concubines placed themselves in the funeral fires. The practice horrified early western colonials, and it was outlawed by the British in 1829, but was not officially condemned by the Indian government until 1987 when they passed the Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, in the wake of a well publicized sati death. The last recorded case of sati in Jodhpur was in 1953. Overlooking Jodhpur as the home of maharajas since 1458, the Meghrangarh Fort has a particularly bloody history, starting with a curse placed during the construction by a hermit who had been living on the mountain. Irritated at being ousted, legend states that he cursed the builder, Maharaja Roa Jodha with threats of drought. To appease the hermit, Jodha built him other nearby accommodations. He then took the further precaution of burying a local man alive in the foundation. In exchange for his life, his descendants are cared for to this day by the state. Other stories from the fort’s history underscore a legacy of violence, primarily taking advantage of the extraordinary height of the fortress: 120 foot walls perch 400 feet over the valley below. Gravity played its gristly part in the death of a prince’s mistress, hurled from a window, a Prime Minister pushed from the ramparts, and Maharaja Rao Ganga’s opium fueled tragic accidental fall. In September of 2008, the bloody history was added to when a stampede at one of the fort’s shrines left 249 people dead, and several more injured. Most of the fort visible today dates from the mid 1600s, and throughout its history various rulers have left their mark on the architecture. Inside the fort opulently furnished palaces include a hall of mirrors, an armory, and displays of the trapping of the Maharajas such as turbans, palanquins, and ceremonial gold and silver elephant howdas (saddles).",
83,Sunderwala Burj,"New Delhi, India",This beautiful 16th-century necropolis marks an astonishing feat in heritage conservation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sunderwala-burj,"One of the most striking features of Sunder Burj, an early 16th-century Mughal-era tomb in New Delhi, India, is its domed ornamental ceiling. The ceiling design, a highly stylized rendition of stars in the night sky, is unmatched in its architectural elegance. Once on the verge of utter ruin, Sunder Burj, meaning “beautiful tower,” is now part of a UNESCO-certified heritage complex witnessing a renaissance in public interest. The newly restored Sunder Burj is situated at the main entrance to Sunder Nursery, the city’s first arboretum, established in the early 20th century. There are also approximately 15 other historical monuments within the complex, including the Lakkarwala Burj, the Mughal Tomb, and Mirza Muzaffar Hussain’s tomb. Extensive conservation work has been carried out on the mausoleums, keeping in mind the preservation of their architectural integrity. From structural repairs to environmental conservation, it took over 10 years to restore the historic necropolis to its former glory. The restoration of Sunder Burj’s ceiling alone required considerable time and effort. The ceiling, now radiant in the honeyed light of an autumn afternoon, had suffered extensive damage due to water seepage and shoddy repair work conducted previously. Trained craftsmen worked tirelessly to restore the decorative plasterwork of the domed ceiling and repair the cracks in the mausoleum’s walls and latticed screens. In landscape design, the conservationists sought inspiration from the formally arranged gardens of the Mughal era. The grand central vista, with its verdant gardens, running canals, flower beds, and sandstone seating, offers sweeping views of the complex. Named as one of the “World’s 100 Greatest Places of 2018” by Time Magazine, this 90-acre historic complex marks an astonishing feat in the field of heritage conservation.",Entry to the complex is ticketed at a nominal price.
84,Mahabodhi Temple,"Bodhgaya, India",Siddhartha Gautama sat here and received enlightenment.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bodh-gaya,"At the young age of 35, Siddhartha Gautama sat beneath a fig tree and received enlightenment. Around 1000 years later, the Buddhist authority in the area finally got around to building a monastery and temple in honor of the sacred location where enlightenment was first achieved. Today, the Mahabodhi Temple’s towering central point reaches a height of 180 feet, and casts a shadow over the tree that shaded Siddhartha during his meditation. While it is not the same tree from 2500 years ago, the tree that stands in the location today is a direct descendent of the original Bodhi tree, and was planted at the site in 288 B.C. Although the tree at Mahabodhi is considered a cutting from the original tree and in the original meditation location, a number of other cuttings exist around the world and are also frequently visited by Buddhist pilgrims. Besides the sacred tree and temple, the area is similarly dotted with Buddhist relics, marking the locations where Buddha reflected on his enlightenment. One of the most prominent sites is the unblinking stupa, which stands in front of the tree. Following the legend, the stupa is supposedly in the same place where Buddha stood and stared at the Bodhi tree after attaining enlightenment. In 2002, the entire area was nominated for preservation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is frequently visited by pilgrims and curious onlookers alike.",

Kasol serves as the base base camps for many treks nearby, mainly Sarpass (13,800 feet) and Pin Parvati Valley Trek. Partitioned into Old Kasol and New Kasol on either side of a main bridge, the town has embraced tourists as they bring in significant amounts of cash. Today, visitors will find internet cafes, body piercing parlors, reggae bars, cheap rentals for people passing through town, and many Western-style restaurants. Visitors are attracted to the town because of its hospitality, beautiful environs, and wild charas, a hand-made hashish made from the cannabis that is plentiful to the area. Kasol is also home to a large population of Israelis. According to locals, the town is a hot spot for a lot of young people who finish their compulsory military service in Israel and then escape to the Parvati Valley.

86,Iron Pillar of Delhi,"New Delhi, India",An ancient iron pillar in Delhi that seems to be rustproof.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iron-pillar-delhi,"On first appearance it doesn’t look like much–a 22 foot tall iron pillar, slowly rusting away in the middle of an empty square in Delhi, India. The surprise comes in learning its age, some 1600 years old, much older than one would expect for an iron column which, judging from other exposed iron, should have turned to a pile of dust long ago. It was this “enigma” which lead some people to include the Iron Ashoka pillar in a group of objects known as OOPArt’s or “out of place artifacts.” These objects are said to be in some way unreasonably futuristic for their time, as if they had come from another place and time. Some among these “out of place” artifacts have been shown to be outright hoaxes, such as the “Coso Artifact” a spark plug said to found embedded in a chunk of rock 500,000 years old. In fact it was a 1920s Champion spark plug which had developed a shell of iron oxide concretion rust around it. Some discoveries have turned out to be a case of underestimating the technological capabilities of people past, such as the antikythera mechanism – an ancient mechanical computer from 100 B.C.—which is known to be both real, and previously to its being discovered, would have been seen as an anachronism. Happily, the Iron Ashoka Pillar of Delhi falls in the second category. Despite being classed with items like the Coso Artifact, and though much was made of its 99.9999% iron purity so pure no one knew how they cast it, (in actually it is only 98% pure), of “ancient and lost” techniques in metallurgy, and of suggestions that it was made of some sort of futuristic or non-earthly metal abounded, in fact the column is much closer to the antikythera mechanism. It is a simple example of the exquisite craft and knowledge of ancient peoples. Ninety eight percent pure wrought iron, the column is a absolute testament to the high level of skill achieved by ancient Indian ironsmiths. It would have had to been made using a coal heated furnace to even create a heat hot enough to achieve forge welding, where two or more pieces of metal were hammered together. However, it has avoided corrosion from the rains, winds and temperature fluctuations over the last 1600 years, not through a conscience effort or magical metallurgy technique on the parts of the pillar’s creators, but through the accidental formation of a “passive protective film.” This film was created by accident through a complicated combination of the lack of lime in the furnaces used to make the iron pillar, the presence of raw slag and unreduced iron in the pillar, and the wetting and drying cycles of the weather. All of which helped to create a 1/20th of a millimeter thick layer of “misawite,”on the pillar. Misawite is a compound of iron, oxygen and hydrogen which does not rust. It seems rather than chalk up the pillar to ancient astronauts, or alien metallurgy, it is enough to recognize the skill involved in creating a six ton, 22 foot high iron pillar, some 1600 years ago.",
87,Neemrana Baori,"Neemrana, India","This abandoned stepwell is one of the largest, deepest, and certainly one of the creepiest in India.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/neemrana-baori,"The bland approach to Neemrana stepwell doesn’t give even the slightest hint of what a visitor is about to encounter. You proceed into the little town of Neemrana, turn right at a featureless corner, drive a few hundred yards down a narrow strip of tarmac, and pull over near a plain stone wall. Careful as you start walking; the view that slowly unfolds is hard to process. There’s a huge manmade chasm where the ground is meant to be, and this unexpected canyon is so deep and so long that its exact size is impossible to fathom. When steps—lots of them—appear, their descent is nearly vertical, and the prospect of stumbling is truly alarming. In fact, anyone with acrophobia, stay away. Welcome to Neemrana baori! This is a subterranean stepwell, regionally known as baori, baoli, bawadi, and vav. It’s a unique type of water-harvesting structure, thousands of which were built throughout India starting around 600 CE. They were perhaps the most significant and multi-functional buildings of their day, primarily providing water year-round. Marvels of architecture, engineering, and art, stepwells guaranteed access to the precious resource, but at Neemrana, for instance, the groundwater was buried so deeply underground that nearly 200 steps were required to reach it during dry seasons. Then, when the monsoons arrived, the water level rose, the steps submerged, and the cycle of dramatic fluctuation repeated. Unfortunately, their past prominence was no guarantee of a noteworthy future, and stepwells slid off history’s grid. Today, most are entirely unknown to the world, even within India where they should be right up there with forts, palaces, tombs, and temples as sites for tourists to throng. The advent of the British Raj, modern water pumps, and plumbing all rendered stepwells obsolete and, untethered from their main purpose, the vast majority became dilapidated, anonymous, filthy, and almost always heartbreaking. Located just a few kilometers off the busy Delhi/Jaipur highway, Neemrana Baori is among the most impressive stepwells in India by virtue of being one of the largest, deepest, and certainly one of the creepiest. There’s an overwhelming sense of abandonment to the place, its broken ledges, dangerously cracked steps, garbage, and graffiti all testaments to its profound neglect. There are precariously hanging bee nests under the eaves, and bats take up residence in the dark corridors. India’s green parakeets flit around, but even their noisy presence can’t dispel the palpably forlorn ambiance here. It’s nearly inexplicable that something so extraordinary (not to mention humungous) as Neemrana appears on no itinerary, in no guidebook, or in the accepted canon of architecture. Such is the case with nearly all stepwells, and only a relative handful are cared for, with one, Rani ki Vav in Gujarat, miraculously earning UNESCO World Heritage status in 2014. But there is such an absence of factual information about most of them that scholars often can’t agree when a stepwell was constructed or who built it, as is the case with Neemrana, which has been ascribed to three separate centuries. The rampant decay may have diminished Neemrana’s magnificence, but it certainly hasn’t destroyed it. This was a welcoming, awe-inspiring, life-giving oasis for centuries of villagers, caravans, and pilgrims who could rest in the cool alcoves, fetch water, hunker down for days away from the hot sun. It may be clinging to life, but it still has the power to awe. Victoria Lautman is an arts and culture journalist with a focus on India.

88,Mahakali Caves,"Mumbai, India",Nineteen ancient rock-cut Buddhist caves can be found on the outskirts of Mumbai.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mahakali-caves,"Beautifully carved out of black basalt rock, the Mahakali Caves just outside Mumbai are one of the few places in the world to see ancient cave dwellings within the borders of a bustling metropolis. These rock-cut caves have existed since the ancient Ashoka Empire, used by Buddhist monks as dwellings and meditation chambers as much as 2,000 years ago. There are 19 caves in total, believed to have been carved between the first and sixth centuries. There are also several cisterns cut from the same rock. Most of the caves are simple and small, with minimal carvings or ornamentation—stark chambers were used as dwellings for the monks and a place to meditate. The exception is the chaitya, the main Buddhist shrine and prayer hall, which is adorned with stupas and large carved statues of Buddha idols. Some of the cave walls have scriptures carved in Pali, a language considered older even than Sanskrit. Strangely, the modern name of these Buddhist caves, Mahakali, refers to the Hindu goddess Kali. This is something of a misnomer, and likely comes from the fact that there is a Hindu temple to Kali nearby. The site is also known as the Kondivite Caves, after the nearby Kondivite village. Interestingly, one of the stupas originally erected as a Buddhist monument is now revered as a Hindu lingam statue.","The Mahakali Caves are located in the Andheri East suburb of Mumbai. From Mumbai, take the train to Andheri Railway Station or Jogeshwari Railway Station, or there are several bus lines that will drop you close by. The site is open every day from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Many of the low-lying rock caves have collapsed over the centuries or have been poorly maintained and are in a state of disrepair.

91,Bara Imambara,"Lucknow, India",This magnificent 18th-century hall consists of a maze of nearly a thousand interconnected passages.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bara-imambara,"The magnificent Bara Imambara in the north Indian city of Lucknow was built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab of Awadh, as a major famine relief project. The massive central hall of the imambara (a Shia Muslim meeting hall) is considered to be the largest arched hall in the world built without any kind of external support from wooden, iron, or stone beams. The trick that keeps the ceiling from crashing in on visitors is also the imambara’s most intriguing architectural feature, the bhulbhulaiya, a labyrinthine network of nearly a thousand interconnected passageways built directly above the chambers, thus reducing the weight of the ceiling by making it hollow. Loosely translated as “maze” in Hindi, the bhulbhulaiya is impossible for visitors to navigate without a guide. Apart from the hall and the maze, the Bara Imambara complex also consists of a large freestanding mosque known as the Asafi Mosque, sprawling courtyards, ornate gateways, and a baoli or stepwell. The most spectacular gateway is the Rumi Darwaza with its scalloped arch, which serves as the west entrance to the complex and a portal to the city’s storied past. During the period of Mughal rule in India, the emperors appointed nawabs, or viceroys, to undertake the administration of various provinces within their territory. Awadh was one such province and the nawabs of Awadh, hailing from Nishapur in Iran, left an indelible mark on the city of Lucknow, the administrative capital, through their art, culture, architecture, and Shi’ite religious traditions. When famine struck the area in the late 18th century and lasted for a decade, nawab Asaf-ud-Daula embarked on the project of building an imambara to provide employment as construction workers to his suffering subjects. Neither a mosque nor a mausoleum, an imambara is a unique edifice used by Shia Muslims for the purpose of religious gatherings during the month of Muharram. Muharram marks the festival of ritualized mourning for the third imam and Muhammad’s grandson Hussain who was martyred in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. Unmatched in its architectural opulence, the Bara Imambara, also known as the Asfi Imambara after its founder, comes alive during the festival of Muharram as believers assemble and take out taziyas, or movable shrines. The Rumi Darwaza opens onto a vast courtyard ending at a triple-arched gateway, which further leads to the main courtyard wherein lies the great imambara. The exterior façade of the imambara is monumental in scale and affords views of the city of Lucknow from multiple levels. Notice the fishes facing each other engraved on the squinches of the gateways, part of the royal insignia of the Awadhi nawabs. The central hall of the imambara, measuring 165 feet in length and 53 feet in width, is an astonishing feat of architecture due to its vaulted ceiling which stands at a height of 50 feet without any supporting pillars or beams. Its walls painted in a soothing combination of pistachio green and white and crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the main hall houses the tombs of the nawab and his talented architect from Delhi, Kifayat-ullah, their graves lying adjacent to each other. The entire structure of the imambara is divided into nine chambers, with eight smaller chambers surrounding the main hall. The space above these chambers was cleverly repurposed into a labyrinthine network of interconnecting passages, accessed through 489 identical doorways and the layout collectively known as the “bhulbhulaiya.”",The complex is open from sunrise to sunset and entry is ticketed. Travelers are strongly cautioned not to venture into the maze without the help of a guide.
92,Modhera Sun Temple,"Modhera, India",An architectural marvel that dates back to the zenith of Indian architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sun-temple-modhera,"A mesmerizing sight to behold, the intricacies of this temple are what make it so amazing. The Sun Temple is a Hindu temple constructed after 1026 CE, during the Chaulukya dynasty. The complex was designed in the Māru-Gurjara style. Unlike other tourist destinations around the country, this temple isn’t usually overrun with tourists, which adds to its appeal. The temple was constructed in such a way that during every equinox, the first sunrays would fall on a diamond placed on the Sun God’s head. The temple was dedicated to the solar deity Surya. The Sabha Mandap stands on 52 pillars that were designed to depict the 52 weeks of the year. Carvings of the sun, along with its unity of four other elements—air, water, earth, and space—can be spotted along the walls of the temple.","Nearest International Airport: Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (Ahmedabad) 101 kilometers from Ahmedabad. Nearest Railway Station: Mahesana Junction (Mehsana), 26 kilometers from Mehsana. Accessible by bus or taxi. Admission fee: 15 INR for Indian Citizens ($0.21), 200 INR for Non-Indian Citizens ($2.73)."
93,Guru Sweet Mart,"Mysore, India","At this sweet shop, the descendants of a royal chef serve up the fudge-like dessert his ancestor invented for a king.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guru-sweet-mart-mysore-pak,"Maharaja Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the 19th-century king of South India’s Mysore Kingdom, was bored. He had a serious sweet tooth, but he’d grown tired of the creations of the royal kitchen. He told his cook, Kakasura Madappa, to create something new. In response to the directive, Madappa created a fudge-like concoction called Mysore pak. More than a century later, Madappa’s descendants continue to sell Mysore pak from their Mysore-based shop, Guru Sweet Mart. At first, Mysore pak—made from a deceptively simple combination of sugar syrup, chickpea flour, and ghee—may not seem like a royal creation. Consider Guru Sweet Mart’s modest layout: While the storefront display is stacked high with multicolored milk-based sweets, the Mysore pak is often kept in crates on the floor. But that’s not because the sweet is unwanted. It’s because the store’s proprietors have maintained such an elevated level of Mysore pak-making, their creation simply can’t stay on the shelves. While small stores across South India sell mediocre Mysore pak that can be either too wet or unpleasantly chalky, Guru Sweet Mart’s version is the antidote to uninspiring imitators: soft, with a toasty ghee smell and a lusciously melty mouthfeel. It is also an instant sugar rush you will feel in your veins. The three brothers who currently run the shop, Kumar, Natraj and Shivananda, along with their cousin, Guru Prasad, keep the small storefront fragrant with fresh Mysore pak brought from their home kitchen several times a day. While they fiercely protect the recipe for their sweet, they have revealed that they clarify their own butter and grind the chickpea flour in their kitchen. At the base of it all is a simple syrup, made of sugar and water, which, in the Kannada language, is called pak. It’s still debated whether Kakasura Madappa or the king himself gave the dish its signature name, combining the name of the sugar syrup with the kingdom. What is certain, however, is that Madappa’s family continues to honor its legacy by churning out a gooey, toasty creation fit for a king.","For an iconic (if chaotic) local experience, head to Guru Sweet Mart on the morning of Dussehra, a Hindu holiday in the fall that celebrates the victory of the god Ram over the demon Ravan. The shop is sure to be full of locals attempting to stock up on Mysore pak for the holiday."
94,Bibi Ka Maqbara,"Aurangabad, India",Half-size replica of the Taj Mahal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bibi-ka-maqbara,"Many replicas of great buildings are comically small, or they are built in a kitschy fashion almost mocking the original. The Bibi Ka Maqbara in Maharashtra, India does neither of those things. It is itself a grand maqbara, meaning “holy tomb” in Arabic, with inlaid walls and marble screens, surrounded by turrets and a reflecting pool. But it is small compared to the inspiration, theTaj Mahal in Agra, over 1000 miles to the north. Known as the “poor man’s Taj Mahal” or the “mini Taj”, like the original it is a monument built in memory of love lost. In this case it was a mother’s love, rather than a wife’s, that inspired Prince Azam Shah to build the structure between 1651 and 1661. The mini Taj was erected less than 30 years after the original, composed of slightly more modest building materials, with limestone and plaster as well as marble under the all-marble onion dome. Marble was abundant in northern India, near Jaipur where the Taj Mahal was built. In order to build the Bibi Ka Maqbara, the marble had to hauled on carts to the new capital of the Mughal empire. The construction took only 6 years, compared to the 22 years for the Taj Mahal. The grounds cover 458 x 275 meters of gardens. At the center of the building is the lone tomb of Rabia-ul-Daurani, third wife of the emperor, and mother of the architect. It may lack some of the staggering size and grandeur of the original, but it does not attract the millions of visitors, or the strict guards who threaten to remove the film from the cameras if you dare take a picture. The mini-Taj exudes its own more humble charm.",From Mumbai: There are two trains daily from Mumbai to Aurangabad daily.
95,Chausath Yogini Temple,"Mitaoli, India",This ancient goddess temple inspired the design of India’s Parliament House.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chausath-yogini-temple-of-mitaoli,"In ancient times, the Yogini Temples of India celebrated the feminine. They were built in a circular style, adorned with exquisite feminine figures, and roofless—open to the natural world. This was a time when female temple dancers, bejeweled and sensuous, danced and sang in the temples, and were bound to the deity, not to any one man. The Chausath Yogini Temple of Mitaoli was one such temple. Constructed in the 11th century, near Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, it is one of the few remaining Yogini Temples still in good condition. Built on a hillock, it commands an impressive vista. The circular wall has 64 (“chausath” means 64) chambers that once held statues of female forms. In the center is an open courtyard with a pavilion for public rituals, including dancing. The chambers today hold Shiva Lingams. The temple is in a Seismic Zone 3, and has withstood the many earthquakes over the centuries without any damage—probably owing to its circular structure. This feature may have been one of the reasons that the Indian Parliament House in Delhi, built by the British in the 1920s, was inspired by the Chausath Yogini Temple of Mitaoli and also built in a circular style. The architectural similarities between the buildings are well noted. According to Indian mythologist Devdutt Patanaik, this is ironic as the British suppressed goddess worship in India, and saw temple dancers as prostitutes, not believing they could have agency over their lives or bodies. They ushered in an era of patriarchal puritanism that reduced women’s rights and delegitimized the feminine hold over temple rituals and temple wealth, already eroded by centuries of Mughal rule. A Yogini is a female practitioner of Yoga, and they represent universal, divine energy that exists in all things. They are the embodiment of spiritual grace and harmony. The Yogini Temples, like the one at Mitaoli, were built by ancient architects who “imagined the temple as the reclining body of a languid woman. Temples were an architectural celebration of sensuality and fertility,” according to Patanaik. Many visitors feel an aura of mystery at this Yogini Temple, and the others that have survived. There is very little known about them, so much has been lost to time. The Yogini Temple in Orissa still has the feminine figures intact, which gives us a better idea of how the Chausath Yogini Temple of Mitaoli may have looked. The Chausath Yogini Temple of Mitaoli has been declared an ancient historical monument by the Archaeological Survey of India.","Also known as Ekattarso Mahadeva Temple, it’s about 40 kilometres from Gwalior, near Morena. Look for signs to the Padhawali Temples, they are nearby."
96,Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashram,"Rishikesh, India",The abandoned site of the Beatles spiritual awakening and subsequent revolt.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maharishi-mahesh-yogi-ashram,"The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashram in Rishikesh, India, is one of the few places associated with the Fab Four that has been largely abandoned. Now remembered for its famous guests and not the teachings of its (possibly charlatan) yogi, the ashram saw the arrival of the Beatles in 1968. At the urging of George Harrison, the entire group traveled to the remote meditation center to study under the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, but the band’s peace was not destined to last. The ashram consisted of meditation cells, a lecture hall, and a great number of purpose-built bungalows where the band stayed. Ringo Starr was the first to leave, citing a distaste for the vegetarian food, and was soon followed by Paul McCartney. George Harrison and John Lennon stuck around for a few weeks more, but after a confrontation with the Maharishi over his conduct among the female students, they too took their leave of the school. Despite having only stayed at the site for a short number of months, the band wrote a number of hit songs about their experience, ensuring the ashram would live in infamy. Today the formerly transcendental complex is largely abandoned and the buildings are being retaken by the surrounding forest. The lecture hall has even been turned into an art project called the Beatles Cathedral with Beatles lyrics and pictures of the band painted all over the walls. The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashram is a bit hard to find, but there are a number of enterprising locals who are more than willing to enlighten visitors for the right price. The complex has now returned to government management as part of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve, leading to the introduction of a small cafe, some signage, a photo gallery, and a 600 rupee entrance fee for foreigners. While most of the buildings postdate the Beatles’ visit, the bungalows they lived in are still (barely) standing and may be visited.","Entrance 150 rupees for Indians, 600 for foreigners.

97,Masrur Temple,"Reserve Jangal Masrur Joni-I, India",15 monolithic temples emulate an eroding sand castle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/masrur-temple,"Intricately carved from one single piece of sandstone, almost nothing is known about the Masrur Temples. Besides conjecture and legend, there are no hard facts connecting the complex to a people or even a time period. When the temples were first constructed, there were 19 in total, all ranging in size and complexity. Over the years, invasion and natural disaster has left only 15 ruins standing, but the high concentration and unique architecture make it one of the most intriguing temple sites in India. According to legend, as good a source as any with the given information, the temples were built by the pandava, five brothers who engaged in a massive war with their cousins in the Hindu epic Mahābhārata. Later archeological speculation supposed the temples were built in the 9th century by wealthy traders, who built the complex as a shrine to Siva, Rama, Lakshamana and Sita. A number of stone statues depicting these deities still exist inside of the larger temples. Along with the actual structures, a 50 meter-long reservoir that is also hollowed from sandstone lies in front of the main structure, and reflects the stone-carved mystery in its waters.",
98,Cenotaphs of Orchha,"Orchha, India",These medieval funerary monuments are now home to a colony of critically endangered vultures.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cenotaphs-of-orchha,"The cenotaphs of the Bundela Rajput kings of Orchha stand like silent sentinels of history on the banks of the river Betwa. Even though the historic landscape of Orchha, a tiny medieval town in central India, is dotted with majestic palaces and temples, the cenotaphs have a sepulchral allure of their own. Fourteen in total, these funereal monuments were built to immortalize the rulers of the Bundelkhand dynasty. From the early 16th to the late 18th century, Orchha, the capital of the Bundela kingdom, remained a theater of war between the Bundela Rajput chieftains and the imperial Mughal authority in Delhi. The Bundela-style of architecture, however, is a harmonious amalgamation of Mughal and Rajput influences, as reflected in the cenotaphs of Orchha. The cenotaphs have been constructed on raised platforms and designed in the form of tall, square buildings with a domed pavilion on top called chatris. A common feature of most Indian architectural styles, a chatri, from the Persian chatr or the Sanskrit chattra, is a type of trabeate domed canopy, resembling an umbrella or a parasol. Since Hindus are cremated, the cenotaphs are empty structures, but the chatris have become the living quarters of a colony of vultures, a critically endangered species. Perched like gargoyles on the spires of the cenotaphs and blending in with the dark, rain-stained walls of these timeworn buildings, the presence of the vultures adds to the eeriness of the landscape. They can either be seen roosting on the rooftops or soaring high and casting long shadows on the ground. With the vulture population in India declining at an alarming rate, the sprawling cenotaph complex has become the focal point of intense conservation efforts. The main reason behind the sharp decline in the detritivore population has been identified to be diclofenac, a livestock drug now banned in India. Diclofenac causes kidney failures in the birds when they consume animal carcasses with trace remains of the drug. Forest authorities, therefore, have to constantly monitor the vulture breeding colonies at the site of the cenotaphs for any outward signs of illness or sudden deaths. The fact that vultures are slow breeders, laying one egg per breeding cycle, has further slowed down the task of improving their numbers.","The ticket for the Orchha Fort Complex covers entry to the cenotaph site. Beware of langurs (long-tailed monkeys), occasional visitors to the site. Cross the narrow bridge over the Betwa and go over to the Orchha Sanctuary side to get a complete view of the sprawling cenotaph complex."

Each August, the rural Pathanamthitta villages of Southern India come alive with a festival dedicated to the harvest known as Maramadi. After the harvest concludes, yoked bulls are sent charging down a football field-sized rice paddy soaked in a 1/2 foot of water. These crazed bulls are then chased down and surfed around the paddy by brave, half-naked participants in a kind of rugged chariot race with much more dirt. Most participants begin by holding onto the rope attached to the bulls, and move to hang onto the tail when their surfing begins.",
100,Anjuna Flea Market,"Anjuna, India",This weekly bazaar started in the 1960s as a way for hippie travelers to barter their goods.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anjuna-flea-market,"Set among the palm trees by the Arabian Sea, the “only-in-Goa” laid-back feel at the Anjuna Flea Market is immediately palpable. Your first clue is the vast range of interesting and eclectic goods sold at this market. Wares range from linen clothes to Nepali and Tibetan artifacts, spices, incense, semi-precious stones, crystals, and carved knives, alongside stalls offering tattoos, dreadlocks or hair-coloring, and body piercings. The village of Anjuna first earned its reputation as a popular hippie destination in the 1960s and ’70s, catering to Western travelers interested in Eastern spiritual traditions. The beachside market was an extension of that experience, and remains a must-see bazaar for visitors in North Goa today. This “bartering bazaar” formed organically around 1960 by travelers who ran short of cash and bartered their goods in the square. In the beginning, locals called it an “open-air hippie goods exchange.” The weekly flea is now a wildly popular attraction for backpackers, tourists, and locals alike. While prices at the market are very affordable, bargaining is an expectation. Most of the eclectic trinkets and wares sold here are from all over India and neighboring countries, and visitors come here for the experience of bargaining rather than in search of local goods. The market also now offers a vast array of global cuisine, including Indian, Israeli, Indo-Chinese and Western food.","The flea market is open on Wednesdays as a weekly bazaar from October to May. Hours of operation are from sunrise to sunset, roughly translating to 8 a.m. to 7  p.m. Make sure you sharpen your bargaining skills and embrace the game of bargaining! Don’t forget to explore the global cuisines in food stalls throughout the market. Hotels close to the beach and flea market include many vacation rentals and converted-quaint, colonial estate homes."
101,The Adiyogi Shiva Statue,"Booluvampatti, India","The world's largest bust sculpture celebrates the Hindu deity, Shiva.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adiyogi-shiva-statue,"Recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s largest bust sculpture, the Adiyogi statue depicts the Hindu deity, Shiva, in 500 tonnes of steel. Surrounded by lush green farms, coconut groves, and the Velliangiri hills, the towering Adiyogi stands 112 feet tall in Coimbatore, India and celebrates Shiva, the first yogi. Shiva is popular in many forms across the land but depicting the deity as the ‘first Yogi’ is not common. The height of 112 feet symbolizes the 112 methods to obtain freedom—or moksha—a theme in yogic culture. It’s also said the height represents the 112 chakras, points of focus in the body used in meditation. The structure, which was inaugurated in February 2017,  is owned and maintained by a non-profit and non-religious organization called Isha Foundation. It was made to remind the world about inner transformation and liberation. According to Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, founder of the Isha Foundation, “Adiyogi is a reminder for humanity to shift from religion to responsibility.” Despite the overtones of Hinduism at Adiyogi, it is a non-religious place. People of any faith and religion are welcome to visit Adiyogi and partake in many of the events that unfold in the shadow of Shiva. The Isha Foundation often holds games, cultural programs, discourses, dinners and other events of camaraderie in front of the statue. At the base of the bust is a quaint shrine where visitors can chant or meditate. Unlike traditional Indian temples or meditation spots, here visitors are allowed to take selfies with Adiyogi.","The Adiyogi Statue is about 30 km from Coimbatore city. Private taxis can be hired from the city to visit Adiyogi. Local buses also serve the route from the Gandhipuram bus stand to Adiyogi. The Isha Yoga Center is situated just a couple of kilometers from the statue, so while you are there, you can also visit the center. There are restaurants, meditation programs and other amenities available at the yoga center."
102,Pushkar Brahma Temple,"Pushkar, India","There are millions of temples in India, but only one prominent temple dedicated to the Hindu creator god.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pushkar-brahma-temple,"Pushkar is a small, serene town in Rajasthan that attracts pilgrims, tourists, and hippies in equal measure. They come for the sacred lake, the chill vibe, and the Brahma Temple. Though Brahma is one of the three main gods of India, this is the only one prominent temple dedicated to him in all of India. Of course, there are many stories as to why. Though Hinduism can boast upwards of 30 million gods, there are three that are considered the Trimurti, the three main gods: Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyer. Throughout the land, there are an uncountable number of temples to Vishnu and Shiva, and other gods; there are 500 temples in tiny Pushkar alone! Yet there are only a couple dedicated to Brahma, and the one in Pushkar is the most prominent. The Pushkar Brahma Temple dates from the 14th century. The colorful structure is made of marble and stone, decorated with silver coins and a hamsa bird (goose or swan) motif, and topped by a distinctive red spire. There are numerous legends to account for the strange fact that the creator god gets so little real estate. Some of them refer to an incident in which Brahma lied about an accomplishment. He was trying to find the head of a pillar of light, and Vishnu was trying to find the foot. They both grew tired and gave up, but while Vishnu admitted his defeat, Brahma lied. He brought back a flower as evidence of reaching the top, but his lie was discovered by Shiva who cursed Brahma that he would have no temple dedicated to his worship as he was undeserving. In another story, Brahma created a beautiful female deity, known as Shatapura, and immediately became infatuated with her. However, Shiva decided this was wrong and punished Brahma by directing that no one on Earth should worship him. But in Puskhar, they say that it was Brahma’s wife, Savitri, who cursed him. In this legend, it is said that a great fire sacrifice was organized and Brahma sent for his wife Savitri to accompany him. She was unavailable, so he married a beautiful young local girl, Gayatri, as he needed a consort for the puja (ritual). When Savitri got wind of this, she rushed to the scene and cursed her husband Brahma by saying that Pushkar would be the site of the only temple dedicated to his worship. Today, there two hills on opposite ends of Pushkar, each with a temple on top. The higher hill is dedicated to Savitri and the smaller one to Gayatri. In Pushkar, they believe that Savitri is still sitting in her shrine, feeling enraged, while Gayatri cowers in fear on the other side of the lake. Whether or not you believe this, it is very pleasant to walk up to the top of either hill in the morning to watch the sunrise over the lovely lake.",
103,Sheroes' Hangout,"Agra, India",This small cafe aims to empower acid attack victims and stop violence against women in India.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sheroes-hangout,"Standing in the shadow of the Taj Mahal, in the city of Agra, rests an unassuming cafe with a colorful mural and an admirable mission to empower women. Tucked away on a dusty street amidst a cacophony of rickshaws and pedestrians stands Sheroes’ Hangout. This pay-what-you-choose cafe employs women who have survived harrowing acid attacks, often at the hands of their own family members or romantic partners. According to USA Today, acid attacks have been on the rise in India, averaging an estimated 250 to 300 victims per year. Often the acid, which is easily procured and extremely corrosive, leaves its victims deformed, blind, and forever scarred. Acid attacks in India tend to be the result of a personal conflict (such as jealousy, lust or rejection). In the case of one Sheroes’ Hangout employee, she underwent 10 reconstructive surgeries after having acid tossed in her face for denying her cousin’s romantic advancements. Victims of such horrific acts can struggle to find their place in society and secure employment. Sheroes’ Hangout aims to empower acid attack survivors while spreading awareness of violence against women in India. “People think that acid attack victims are from the outer world. Sheroes’ is an effort to make them believe that they are from this world only,” Ashish Shukla, a lead campaigner for Stop Acid Attacks, told Al Jazeera. “Since we as a society are responsible for their scars, it is our responsibility to fix it and bring them into the mainstream of society.” Sheroes’ Hangout represents the growing revolution of women who are standing up against the widespread femicide and female-based violence in India. Groups, such as the vigilante pink-clad ‘Gulabi Gang’ now travel from town-to-town educating men and taking on the patriarchy. With their hot pink saris, the Gulabi Gang carry forth the message of anti-violence that places like Sheroes’ Hangout are eager to spread. Sheroes’ Hangout serves fresh Indian fare such as Vegetarian Biryani, Paneer Butter Masala, and Dal Fry. While the food is regaled as being fresh and authentic, it is the mission behind Sheroes’ Hangout that is the main draw. The cafe features women-made art and aims to educate each person who walks in on the reality of acid attacks in the country. Each woman employed at Sheroes’ Hangout is a brave survivor, courageously finding new beginnings after their attacks, reminding each of us that true beauty is found within.","Sheroes' Hangout is located behind Go Stops Hostelin, Taj Nagari Phase 1, Agra. Just above the Meena Bazar shop. For those interested in supporting the work of Sheroes' Hangout, online donations are accepted."
104,Amber Fort,"Amer, India",This opulent 16th-century Maharaja’s palace is a unique mix of Hindu and Muslim designs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amber-fort,"The resplendent Amber Fort sprawls along the top of a natural hill outside the city of Jaipur. Historically significant and architecturally stunning, Amber Fort (pronounced AH-meer) is a well-preserved monument from the glorious days of Rajput rule in Rajasthan. The historic hill fort rises above the town of Amer (it is sometimes called Amer Fort), which was the capital of the Kuchwaha Rajputs from the 11th to the 18th century. Construction began in 1592 by Maharaja Man Singh, a commander in the army of the Mughal emperor Akbar. In shades of honey and rose stone, white marble and gilt decor, Amber Fort is more of a palace than a fortress, and the design is a unique mix of Hindu and Muslim styles. A long, steep climb up to the fort takes visitors into a huge courtyard, Jaleb Chowk. Once through the ticket gate, there’s a lot to see in the palace complex as you move from one courtyard to another, each leading to more private and opulent chambers, plus temples, gardens, and terraces. The first is the many-pillared Diwan-i-Am, the Hall of Public Audience. From there, you enter through the beautifully painted Ganesh Pol (gate) to the private inner apartments of the fort. The Diwan-i-Khas includes an ornamental garden and the dazzling Sheesh Mahal, Hall of Mirrors. The walls of the Sheesh Mahal are covered in an intricate mosaic of shards of mirror and colored glass. It’s one of the treasures of Amber Fort, astounding visitors with the beauty of the cut Belgian glass. Apparently, this room was made by the Maharaja so that the Maharani (queen) could see the stars at night, as she was not allowed to sleep in the open. When candles are lit at night, the room seems to reflect thousands of stars from the walls and ceiling. Other inner rooms include the Jal Mandir, or Hall of Victory, which features carved marble panels a mirrored ceiling, and expansive views over the ramparts of the fort. The Sukh Niwas, the Hall of Pleasure, is a marble room that was cleverly cooled with water. Here, the Maharaja reportedly relaxed with his ladies. The oldest part of the fort, completed in 1599, includes the Palace of Man Singh and the zenana, women’s quarters. In the centre of the zenana is a pavilion, and the wives’ rooms were ranged around the courtyard. It’s a splendid and well-preserved fort and well worth a lengthy visit.","The fort is open every day from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Foreign ticket price is 200 rupees, 100 rupees for students. Domestic ticket price 25 rupees, 10 rupees for seniors, students. The evening Sound and Light Show is spectacular. You can walk, take a jeep, or opt for an elephant ride up the hill to the fort (though animal lovers will not want to ride the elephants as they look hot and weary). Elephant rides (not recommended) are 900 rupees for 2 people. Amber Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site, part of a group of six hill forts in Rajasthan."

Known as Thimmamma Marrimanu, this forest is no ordinary forest, but rather a singular tree, the largest banyan tree in the world. According to local mythology, Thimmamma Marrimanu was created in 1434 when an Indian widow named Thimmamma committed sati, a Hindu practice where a woman immolates herself on the pyre of her dead husband. According to local mythology, her sacrifice gave life to the massive Thimmamma Marrimanu (Thimmamma Banyan Tree), which purportedly sprung from the northeastern pole of the pyre. The colossal banyan tree, now more than 550 years old, contains a small temple at its base and is still worshiped to this day by the local community. The tree is strongly believed by its cult of worshipers to produce healthy children for its most ardent (and barren) believers. Unlike most tree species, the banyan grows from the top down. Seeds in the tree’s branches allow a tendril to drop to the ground, expanding the banyan’s reach. These 1,100 prop roots are what make the singular tree appear to be an entire forest. Along with this top-down growth, Thimmamma Marrimanu experiences an even more bizarre biological phenomenon. The tree is kept alive through coevolution; fig wasps lay their eggs in the tree’s figs, helping both species to survive and expand. Perhaps the tree does have magical qualities after all.",

Today, most travelers who visit Amer come to see the famous Amber Fort. But many are unaware that just next to the massive castle lies a yellow-colored stepwell, built in the 16th century. Stepwells are not new to the state of Rajasthan, as half of its land is on dry desert soil. Many locals suggest Panna Meena ka Kund was built so the people of Amer could collect water, which was later used at many temples nearby. Women also came here to fill their water pots for household work. Apart from this, Panna Meena ka Kund was a resting place for many travelers—business people and saints alike—as the temperature inside the stepwell is significantly cooler. Panna Meena ka Kund is a square-shaped stepwell, with adjoining stairs on all four sides and a room on the northern wall. It’s believed this room was used for religious ceremonies before weddings or on popular festival dates. Panna Meena ka Kund is not one of the biggest stepwells in Rajasthan, but it’s worth visiting. For the last two decades, this stepwell has been maintained by the local municipal authority, and thus you will find many travelers coming here to take some nice pictures.","There is no entry ticket for Panna Meena ka Kund, and the best option to reach it is by foot. Though with the help of a local, you can take your car till the stepwell site."
107,Khari Baoli Rooftop,"New Delhi, India",The roof of one of the world’s largest spice markets provides a grand view over the neighborhood's glorious bustle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khari-baoli-rooftop,"Old Delhi is bursting with history and with modern-day activity. Built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the mid-1600s as a walled city called Shahjahanabad, it served as the empire’s capital from then until the British Raj gained supremacy in 1857. Though India’s current center of government rests a few miles south in New Delhi, Old Delhi has stood the test of time as a center of commerce. The street of Khari Baoli might be the most lively and fascinating piece of Old Delhi. It is certainly the most pungent, because it hosts one of the world’s largest wholesale spice markets. The myriad bright and wonderful spices that enliven Indian cooking are displayed in large mounds and traded in giant sacks. Walking through the market is an experience in itself, but it is hard to find a vantage point from which to survey its full glory. The rooftop of the Khari Baoli wholesale spice market, also known as Gadodia Market, provides this perspective. The market is a multistory rectangular building built in the 1930s around a large courtyard by a wealthy merchant named Seth Lakshmi Narain Gadodia. Its architecture is intricate, with large chattris [domed pavilions] at each corner of the roof as well as complex balconies and arched doorways on lower stories. The rooftop is free to access and provides expansive views of the street markets, the stunning Fatehpuri Masjid mosque, and on clear days even the Red Fort. In the morning and around sunset, it is an ideal place to relax and watch life go by in one of the world’s most historic cities. While the roof is an oasis of quiet in Old Delhi’s din, it also plays host to its own lively rhythms. Boys and young men fly kites from it, and merchants use the space to dry spices and vegetables. Calls to prayer from the nearby mosque wash over it. Traveling vendors from other states also use the courtyard and roof as a place to rest or sleep. It is a living piece of the city’s history. According to the New Indian Express, the spice trade lost most of its business during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown. Future visitors can help maintain this incredible place which combines the past and present.","Timing: While there are no formal open hours, there are informal local watchmen who will not allow visitors to access the rooftop after sunset. To be safe, plan to arrive by 5:00 p.m. in the winter or 6:00–6:30 p.m. in the summer. Morning and evening are the best times to visit for nice light and cooler temperatures. Fees: It is free to visit the rooftop. Locals may offer to show visitors the way and explain some history for a fee, but it is not necessary to pay anyone. That being said, consider carrying cash to take advantage of the great prices for spices and dried fruits in the surroundings shops. Safety: The main road has a great deal of traffic; take care when crossing. While the vast majority of people are welcoming, be alert for pickpockets because the dense and hectic atmosphere provides easy cover. The area is dominated by men and local women are scarce on the rooftop, so there may be more risk for solo women. Navigation: Even though the market is in the Old Delhi neighborhood, it's still within the city of New Delhi. To find the building, enter the Gadodia Market's large courtyard from the main Khari Baoli road. There are eight unmarked staircases going up from the courtyard to the roof, located at the corners of the courtyard. Find any of these and climb to the top. Finally, it is worth noting that the term “Khari Baoli” refers to multiple sites. The larger neighborhood, the main road that runs through it, and the specific wholesale spice market itself. Use the more specific term “Gadodia Market” to get to the right place."
108,Ratneshwar Mahadev Temple,"Varanasi, India","Known as the leaning temple, the sacred structure has somehow developed a severe nine-degree slant.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ratneshwar-mahadev-temple,"With its rakish, mysterious lean, the Ratneshwar Mahadev Temple draws a lot of attention from pilgrims and tourists visiting the holy city of Varanasi in India. The temple was built extremely close to the Ganges River and has developed a nine-degree slant. By contrast, the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy tilts just four degrees. No one knows, exactly, why the temple has developed such a severe lean. Like so many buildings and monuments in India, legend and history do not match up when it comes to Ratneshwar Mahadev Temple. The lean could be the result of a structural problem, or because it was built on silt, or because of a curse. According to a popular legend, a man built the temple in honor of his mother, and proudly boasted that he had paid his debt to her. However, she cursed the temple, stating that the debt to one’s mother can never be paid. No one knows why the leaning temple was built so close to the river’s edge, either. In fact, the temple is so close to the Ganges that part of it is actually underwater for much of the year. In the 19th century, the priest used to dive in the water to conduct worship when the temple entrance was submerged, according to some reports. Also called the Kashi Karvat (Kashi is the ancient name for Varanasi and karvat means leaning in Hindi), the temple was probably built in the mid-19th century, either by the Queen of Gwalior or the Amethi royal family. Photos of the temple from the 1860s show that it was not leaning at that time.",
109,Bylakuppe,"Bylakuppe, India",The world's largest Tibetan refugee settlement.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bylakuppe,"The road from Madikeri to the Tibetan settlement in Bylakuppe is lined with farm cooperatives. Driving through the fields, one gradually gets used to the incongruous sight of monks driving tractors. Bylakuppe is the largest Tibetan refugee settlement in the world. In the 1960s, the Indian government granted asylum to the Dalai Lama, and land was set aside for the waves of Tibetan refugees, hot on the heels of their spiritual leader. The settlement has since transformed the once desolate Karnataka countryside into a replica of Lhasa. One can sense the huge contrast, when traveling from main Mysore city and stepping into Bylakuppe. Well greeted by the serenity of the environment and composed smiles from the monks. Bylakuppe’s attractions include the Sera Monastery and the Namdroling Monastery, also known as the Golden Temple. If one has the good fortune of arriving while a prayer session is taking place, one will be greeted by an audio-visual spectacle. Hundreds of maroon-clad monks will stream in to take their seats, flip the prayer books in front of them and proceed to chant in unison while wielding their prayer wheels. The reverberation monotonous chants create a nice vibration, tapping the soul within. It is a hypnotic and mystical experience. The monks are friendly, and they will be very glad to answer any questions. One monk explained in halting English that the journey to Bylakuppe had been an arduous one - they had to travel through Nepal and it took many days. Outside the monastery posters and banners protesting the Chinese occupation of Tibet hang in the wind. One lama from Bhutan, shared that he came here to complete his university studies. Moving towards the life of a Rinpoche*, he needs to study scripture, chants, and meditation faithfully in a secluded room ( far deep inside the Golden Temple) for three, six, and nine years separately. Bylakuppe is a powerful testament to human resilience. The Tibetan people’s will to preserve their way of life, their faith, and their identity, has pushed them so far south, into a place starkly different from where they come from. *Rinpoche is an honorific used in Tibetan Buddhism. It literally means “precious one.”","Getting to Bylakuppe * Fly into Bangalore, then take a public bus, passing through Mysore, to Kushalnagar. * Take an auto rickshaw from Kushalnagar to Bylakuppe. It might be better to just tell the driver ""The Golden Temple"". The trip takes 10 minutes should cost no more than 30 rupees."
110,Antilia,"Mumbai, India",World's most expensive home.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antilia,"Mukesh Ambani has more money then he knows what to do with. In 2011, Forbes ranked him the 9th richest man in the world, with a net worth of $27 billion. In an attempt to spend a good chunk of that wealth, Ambani purchased land on one of the most expensive streets in Mumbai and began constructing Antilia, a towering behemoth that will serve as the family home for his wife, three children and 600 staff members. In 2002, Ambani purchased the property and began work on his 400,000 square foot home. Although the house has 27 floors, it is 567 feet high, with each floor boasting incredibly high vaulted ceilings. Each floor in the complex offers something different and there are no identical floor plans. The Ambani family will occupy only the top four floors. Conveniently, there are still 23 other floors for luxuries such as parking space for 168 cars, a health spa, swimming pools, a movie theater and three spectacular hanging gardens spaced at different levels of the building. All told, the house will come with a price tag over $1 billion. Since construction began, Antilia has drawn criticism from within India and across the world. From the top floor of the 27-story home, there are spectacular views of the Arabian Sea, as well as the slums of Mumbai sprawling on the outskirts of the indian city. Much of the criticism has been spurred by this fact, as Ambani’s impressive show of wealth seems to show a lack of empathy for the impoverished who inhabit the slums. This lack of awareness seems even stranger considering that Ambani’s father was born to a poor family and became a self-made billionaire.","This is a private home, please do not tresspass."
