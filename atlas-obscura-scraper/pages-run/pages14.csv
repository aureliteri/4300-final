0,Tanah Lot,"Kediri, Indonesia",Isolated atop this Balinese sea crag is a lovely Hindu temple that is said to be guarded by sea snakes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tanah-lot,"Just one of seven ocean temples on the coast of Bali that create a sort of spiritual bulwark against bad vibes rolling on the ocean currents, the ancient shrine atop Tanah Lot is said to be protected from demons by snakes both small and monster-sized. The true origins of Pura Tanah Lot (the temple that sits atop Tanah Lot) are lost to the sea spray of time, but according to legend it was created in the 16th century at the behest of a now-mythologized holy man. Along with the other six sea temples along the Bali shore, each within eyeshot of the next, it is meant to pay respect to the guardian spirits of the sea. The constant pounding of the currents against the base of Tanah Lot have created a number of sea caves at the foot of the rock formation, many of which are home to sea snakes. These snakes are rumored to protect the temple from evil spirits along with a giant nightmare snake that lurks in the waters around the temple. At low tide, Tanah Lot can be approached on foot.  The outer sanctum of the temple is open to visitors (holy men receive and bless you), but the inner sanctum of the temple itself is forbidden to any non-Balinese visitors. The small caves exposed by the receding water can be explored, for those who are not concerned by snakes (real or otherwise).  There is a cave within a cave on the beach where visitors may approach and receive a blessing from the sacred snake. Despite not being able to explore much of the rock’s surface, it cuts a stunning figure against the backdrop of the ocean horizon and the site has accordingly sprouted an unctuous tourist market full of stalls selling cheap merchandise to gullible sightseers. Maybe one day the temple’s guardian snake will rise up and protect the temple’s sanctity from those that would capitalize on its beauty.","Most tourists hire a car and driver for the day to visit Tanah Lot, along with the other popular temples as they are far apart from each other. The road to Tanah Lot temple can be dangerous, hence this is advisable. Alternatively, you can pay for a taxi and ask them to wait for you while you visit the place. If you have the time, the paddy fields along the way to this temple are worth a slow ride to enjoy the view. You may also want to detour to the rugged beach of Pantai Seseh nearby."
1,Ghost Palace Hotel,"Baturiti, Indonesia","An abandoned hotel in the highlands of Bali is shrouded in stories of ghosts, curses, and corruption.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ghost-palace-hotel,"Near the road from hard-partying Kuta to picturesque Lake Beratan, a massive luxury resort stretches languorously down a mountain ridge—not a particularly notable sight, but for the fact that this hotel sits dark and empty. Built in the 1990s and seemingly abandoned on the eve of its opening, the pristine modernity of this derelict building adds significantly to that giddy, something-bad-happened-here feeling that tantalizes ghost hunters and urban explorers alike. The Ghost Palace Hotel—more formally known as the PI Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel and Resort—lies overgrown with creepers, weeds, and legends. One story suggests that the real estate developer behind the project became cursed due to his corrupt business practices and subsequently went bankrupt. Another tells of a fully operational hotel filled with workers and guests, all of whom suddenly disappeared in one night, leaving specters and demons to stalk the hotel’s empty corridors. Other ghostly accounts chalk up the supernatural presence to the spirits of laborers worked to death in the construction of the hotel. Bizarrely, the actual history of the Ghost Palace Hotel is somewhat difficult to verify, but the most likely scenario is that it was built starting in the early 1990s as an investment project of Tommy Suharto, the youngest son of former Indonesian President Suharto. Tommy went to prison in 2002, after being convicted of ordering the assassination of a judge on Indonesia’s Supreme Court who had previously found him guilty of corruption charges. Subsequently, construction of the hotel ground to a halt and has never restarted. Now abandoned for over a decade, the building still bears the furnishings and fixtures of a hotel preparing to receive its first guests. A video from a recent visit to the Ghost Palace Hotel can be seen here.","The Ghost Palace Hotel, or PI Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel & Resort, is located on the mountains in the central highlands of Bedugal, 50km north of Kuta. This hotel is not open for public. The main entrance is guarded, but the site can be entered at its highest point, at the back end, by hopping over the fence. According to the previous visitors, entrance through the main gates is watched by 'security officers' and cleaners; at some point they began to take payment of about 10,000 IDR to enter the hotel."
2,Sacred Monkey Forest (Mandala Wisata Wenara Wana),"Ubud, Indonesia",Hindu temple of the dead home to hundreds of long-tailed macaques.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacred-monkey-forest,"In the center of Bali a centuries-old temple complex doubles as an ecological sanctuary for a thriving population of roughly 500 monkeys. The Balinese long-tailed macaques that call the Monkey Forest home are free to come and go as they choose - there are no cages, and no walls to hold them in, so visitors to the Monkey Forest have the unusual opportunity to watch monkeys close up, with no bars between them. Elsewhere in Bali macaques are often seen as pests, liable to steal valuable crops, but in the Monkey Forest they are revered and cared for as part of the spiritual life of the temples, and as manifestations of the Hindu monkey gods. The monkeys are fed and cared for by a staff of locals, who are also there to keep a watchful eye on tourists. The forest itself is comprised of 27 acres of deeply forested land, winding paths, sacred sculptures, and three distinct temples. Over 80 different species of trees have been identified within the forest, which also offer sanctuary to a host of birds, lizards, squirrel and deer, in addition to the star monkeys. The Monkey Forest is also home to a Pura Dalem, or Bali temple of the dead. It acts as counterpoint to the Pura Puseh (temples of origin) and Pura Desa (village temple) and contains a cemetery and Pura Prajapati (cremation temple) dedicated to Dewa Siwa, who judges the karma of the dead. Headstones are easily visible in a clearing visible between the trees near the cremation temple, where the recently dead are buried while their families and loved ones save up for the lavish cremation festivities unique to Balinese culture. At the appointed time families will disinter the dead and relocate them to an elaborate cremation pyre, after which the ashes are distributed to family shrines. It is thought that the earliest temple structures date back to around the mid 13th century, but they have been revised and rebuilt so many times over the years, up to an including the present day, that the edges of ancient and recent are thoroughly blended. The most sacred space in the Monkey Forest is the Lingga Yoni, a Hindu representation of phallus and womb, that has occupied the inner sanctum of the temple for hundreds of years. The third sacred space is a bathing temple, located along the stream that runs through the forest. In recent years researchers from around the world have taken advantage of the opportunity to observe the monkeys in several studies. Local vendors selling bananas and other treats to feed to the monkeys are usually positioned near the entrances, but visitors should bear in mind that the monkeys are wild animals that may bite and also may possibly carry disease. The official position of the Monkey Forest seems to be that no one will stop you from feeding the monkeys, but if you get bit it’s your own damned fault. Their website gently suggests that you might prefer to watch the staff feed the monkeys instead.","Entry: 40000 IDR (about $3) for adults, 30000 IDR (about $2.25) for students. Opening Hours: Monday-Sunday from 8 AM to 6 PM. Parking is free."
3,Pura Lempuyang Luhur,"Abang, Indonesia","Bali's remote ""gateway to heaven"" is one of the most sacred places on the island.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pura-lempuyang,"Pura Lempuyang Luhur is a complex of temples that speckles a trail leading to the top of Mount Lempuyang, a holy mountain. A total of seven temples dot the mountain’s slopes. At the lowest temple, a fantastic “gateway to heaven” greets visitors. Looking through the gate on a clear day reveals Mount Agung framed within its sides. Beyond the gate, three beautiful nāga-lined staircases lead up to the lowest temple. Pura Lempuyang Luhur is one of the oldest and holiest sites on the island and is thought to predate most Hindu temples there. The whole complex has been dubbed one of the “six sanctuaries of the world,” considered the most sacred places of worship on Bali. Yet, because of its remote location tucked away on the island’s eastern end, the complex saw few foreign visitors until recent years. Adventurous (and reasonably fit) travelers may hike up to the top temple, which is a four hour round-trip in total. Along the way, visitors will pass six other temples and can see beautiful vistas before finally arriving at Pura Lempuyang Luhur. Locals believe one must never complain on the way up. If one complains, they will not make it to the top. Pura Lempuyang Luhur, the highest temple, is the crown jewel of the complex (and also its namesake). It sits atop the mountain’s peak, which is believed to be its most sacred spot. Those who make it to the top are rewarded with a peaceful sanctuary and breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains.","Pura Lempuyang is not easily accessible, and parking is limited. The best way to get there is to hire a car and driver. If coming from Ubud or the beach towns on the south coast, budget one full day for this excursion, and consider pairing it with a visit to the nearby Tirta Gangga water gardens. Be respectful at all times. Wear a sarong while visiting this temple complex, and make sure bare knees and shoulders are not visible. This applies to both men and women. If observing a ceremony, take photographs from a respectful distance using your zoom lens. There's no fee to get into the temple, but donations are requested."
4,Gereja Ayam,"Magelang, Indonesia",This massive chapel in the middle of the Indonesian forest is both haunting and fowl.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gereja-ayam,"Should you be trekking through the thick forests of Magelang, Indonesia, try not to be too alarmed if you stumble upon a titanic building shaped like a chicken. Known as Gereja Ayam (unsurprisingly, “Chicken Church”), this moldering, behemoth, bird-like building is an unexpected, whimsical sight to stumble upon. While the locals have dubbed it the Chicken Church (and it’s easy to see why), the name is a bit of a misnomer since the visionary behind the crumbling chapel meant it to look like a dove. The man behind the weird structure was Daniel Alamsjah, who received a holy vision that inspired him to create the dove church. He picked a forested hill near Magelang to build his pious tribute, and created possibly the most bird-like building in the world, complete with giant, squawking head, and ornate decorative tail feathers. The prayer house opened its doors (or spread its wings, so to speak) by the 1990s. The fledgling church welcomed any religions that wanted to make the trek, including Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians, holding services in the upper floors, while the lower floors provided rehab and juvenile outreach, among other charitable services. Unfortunately, the project was grounded in 2000 when further construction costs became too high. The poor chicken-dove-church was vacated, and left to the forest. Gereja Ayam continued to rot over the years, becoming a bit more ghoulish (in an avian way), with each year. But these days, it’s been cleaned up and turned into a proper tourist attraction. Local artists have covered the inner walls with vibrant murals showing local mythology and history and there’s a small cafe nestled within the chicken’s rear that sells traditional, tasty treats. You can even climb up to the top of the bird’s head for amazing 360-degree views. The Chicken Church has gained some media attention. In 2016 the documentary film, Into the Inferno, has a section devoted to the temple highlighting the connection to the nearby volcano.",Church is open every day and is often part of the nearby Borobodur Temple tour; there is a small entry fee.
5,Taman Festival,"Denpasar Timur, Indonesia",A haunting theme park is slowly being swallowed by the jungle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taman-festival-bali,"Eerie and overrun with lush greenery, this abandoned theme park in Bali is an urban explorer’s dream. Colorful graffiti adorns the walls of its crumbling buildings. Most of the park has succumbed to nature’s mercy and is slowly being swallowed by the jungle. It isn’t known for certain as to why this grand theme park was deserted by the owners before it ever even opened. Some reports say the owners abandoned ship after fearing it would become unprofitable following the 2002 Bali terrorist attacks. Others say lightning struck its laser machines, which were meant to illuminate the night sky as part of the park’s star attraction. Never fated to fill its grounds with throngs of tourists, it has now become a home for graffiti artists and budding photographers. Wander among the pathways that meander through the eight-hectare site (beware of the broken glass), and you’ll find an olympic-sized swimming pool, a cinema, a wedding chapel, and many restaurants, all reclaimed by nature. It’s a haunting experience. Vines and weeds twist sinisterly around the decrepit structures, while miniature jungles overtake others. Bats, enormous spiders, and a host of other insects hide in the dark corners of the dust-coated buildings. Keep an eye out for the empty crocodile pit—its former residents were left to roam the park after it was abandoned and supposedly lurk just out of sight. Rumors abound that these reptilian residents have been know to snack on humans.","If arriving by bike, you need to pay 2500IDR to the landowner for parking. Locals may charge you something between 10000 and 20000 IDR per person to let you in."
6,Komodo National Park,"East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia",A sprawling nature preserve harbors the world's only living dragons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/komodo-national-park,"Historically, dragons have been feared and hunted, but the Komodo National Park was created to protect the only known “dragon” in the world. The Komodo dragon is the largest lizard in the world and can grow up to 2-3 meters in length which would be scary enough if it weren’t for the monster’s poison bite. Despite the beast’s hideous visage and carnivorous reputation this Indonesian wildlife reserve was created to make sure that it does not go extinct. Komodo Island is the only place in the world where the huge lizards live and their relatively small population puts them at extreme risk.  Covering a number of small islands including the largest islands of Komodo, Padar, and Rinca, the national park keeps the delicate natural balance from disappearing. A number of other protected lizards, rats, and snakes also inhabit the islands along with a collection of large mammals that were introduced by man such as buffalo, deer, and monkeys. Unlike many wildlife parks, Komodo covers four human settlements as well, all of which existed when the park was designated. The people living in the park are mainly fishermen and tradesmen. Visitors are welcome to the islands. In order to keep tourists safe from the huge lizards, locals feed the Komodo dragons in the morning so that they are less inclined to look for visiting prey. The protection offered by the reserve has expanded over the years and now includes a marine biome which is preserved along with the other exotic flora and fauna in the Komodo National Park. Despite the increasingly diverse environments in the park, it is unlikely to be known for anything more than the dragons that stalk its shores.","You can arrange for group tours to the various islands of Komodo or even hire your own personal ride to visit Flores Islands. The Komodo National Park is open daily from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and there is even an adventure trek in Komodo Island that takes around 4-5h (4.9 miles). Visitors are advised to bring sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, hike shoes and plenty of water."
7,Goa Gajah,"Sukawati, Indonesia","The name of this ancient Indonesian temple translates as ""Elephant Cave"" but it could be more accurately called ""The Hellmouth.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goa-gajah,"Not far outside of the city of Ubud in Bali is a fantastical archeological site known as Goa Gajah, or “Elephant Cave,” although visitors could be forgiven for finding this name confusing given the wild-eyed demon maw that serves as a front door. The ill-fitting monicker comes from a complicated trickle down of translations relating to the temple cave throughout history that may have alluded to elephants at one point. However there does not seem to be any actual pachyderm imagery anywhere on the site. Instead the facade of the cave is carved into a surprisingly menacing devil’s face with wide eyes staring over the doorway that acts as its screaming mouth. All around the monster’s face is what seems to be a roiling sea of flames. Flanking the frightening frieze are smaller sculptures of creatures that have eroded with time. Despite this terrifying entrance the cave is actually thought to have been a place of meditation and spiritual cleansing where religious offerings were left (and still are). While no one is positive of the original use of the space, it is speculated that the demon’s face on the outside was actually meant to scare away evil spirits, not attract them. A large communal bath was unearthed nearby in the 1950’s featuring tall statues of serene figures pouring water out of jars into the central bath. A far cry from the howling cave entrance. Today the ornately unsettling cave can be visited and all those daring to pass through the demon’s jaws can witness the cave’s secluded quietude. Just don’t think of elephants.","15,000 Rp"
8,Trunyan,"Trunyan, Indonesia",One native village in Bali lays their dead at the foot of a holy tree whose natural fragrance seems to hide the stench as the bodies decompose.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trunyan,"The walk up to the Trunyan cemetery in Bali is littered with skulls and human bones which have been set up on stones. This is a byproduct of the nearby villagers’ unique death ritual that sees the deceased placed above ground at the foot of a tree to simply decompose in the open air. One might think that such a laissez-faire practice would lead to not only an unstoppable vermin and carrion bird infestation, but also an unlivable stench. However, when the bodies are laid out, they are placed at the foot of a large banyan tree which the villagers consider holy, and which seemingly masks the scent of the corpses. This sacred funeral rite is performed when one of the village’s number dies of natural causes, at which time a white sheet is placed over the body and they are laid out. Others are laid out above ground and covered with bamboo teepees. The villagers who adhere to this practice belong to a group known as the Bali Aga, people who have descended from the original Balinese natives. Their unique “burial” traditions are believed to go back hundreds of years, yet there does not seem to be a case of the exposed corpses presenting a health or comfort issue. In fact, a number of tourists visit the site each year, to the point where it is now common to be approached repeatedly by villagers asking for donations, and even getting there requires exorbitant bribes for boat transportation. However, one thing nearly no one is complaining about is the smell.","Trunyan cemetery is most easily accessible by boat from Kedisan. The price of the boat ride (including the donation for the village) was 400, 000 IDR per person in May 2017. For comparison to rent a car for 10 hours with driver was 550, 000 IDR."
9,Padar Island,"Komodo, Indonesia","Once home to Komodo dragons, this island dreamscape has a rare combination of white, pink, and black sand beaches.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/padar-island,"The Indonesian island of Padar is about 20 miles (30 km) from Labuan Bajo, a fishing town on the westernmost part of Flores. Padar is small, but is the third largest island of Komodo National Park, and was once a stomping ground for the immense dragons that gave the reserve its name. Padar is mostly savannah-covered, surreal landscape fringed by bright green-capped mountains of fairy-tale shapes. It’s all surrounded by three turquoise bays, and curiously, each one of the bays’ beaches has different coloured sand: One is pearly white, another charcoal black, and a third is a very rare baby pink. It is a rare combination, a quirk of this unique island. The black-sanded beach has volcanic origin, composed of various dark minerals. The pink, one of a few in the world, has pulverized red coral mixed with white sand.  And the white one, in most any other setting would be a spectacular find. Here, it almost plays third fiddle. Padar is home to a remarkable array of wildlife, especially for its size. There are six species of shark, and two of manta rays, and many different reptiles. There once were three kinds of Komodo dragons here. (They are gone now, but still found on Komodo, Rinca, Gili Montang, Gili Dasami, and Flores.) There are dolphins, the occasional whale, falcons, kites, geckos, and green turtles. And then there are some plain old little mammals, to feed their neighbor predators.","Visitors can do a 30 minute hike to Padar's summit to see a panoramic view of the island, go trekking for around an hour, snorkel or just hit the pristine tri-colored beaches. Labuan Bajo is the closest city, and there are tours departing daily for one, two, or three-day visits. The best time is from April to June, and from September to November. Bring sunscreen, sunglasses, good hiking shoes, a hat, plenty of water and get ready for some serious 30-foot exercise uphill."
10,Pura Ulun Danu Bratan,"Baturiti, Indonesia",This tiny lake temple dedicated to a water goddess seems to float on the surface.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pura-ulun-danu-bratan,"Bali’s Pura Ulun Danu Bratan temple pokes up out of the waters of Lake Bratan as though it is simply the peak of some much larger temple just beneath the water. While it is as starkly humble as it seems, its importance to the community would seem to back up that grander fantasy. Constructed in 1633, the temple is devoted to the goddess of the lake, Ida Batara Dewi Ulun Danu, in Balinese. The pair of relatively small pagodas that sit on the lake’s waters act as the mother shrines to a countless series of smaller shrines set up at various points downstream. The lake itself has been the main reservoir for a large portion of central Bali for ages and is thus not only functionally very important but also holy to many. In order to keep the waters clean and flowing, the temples on the lake are devoted to the goddess Dewi Danu whose demesne includes rivers, lakes, and other waters. There are also fertility idols at the site of the temples due to the area’s legendary potency and virility, which is also attributed to the waters of the lake. Visitors to the Pura Ulun Danu Bratan site will first pass through an ornate temple structure on land before being able to board a canoe directly to the pagodas, which seem to almost float right on the water. The little buildings actually sit on a pair of small lake islands; however, the visual effect is nonetheless impressive. The site is popular among those looking to take in Bali’s most beautiful temples, but the meditative quietude of the lake backdrop is likely enough to make up for the presence of any strangers.","One of the easy and convenient ways to get there yourself is to take one of the public transports to Lake Bratan from Denpasar or Lovina. Alternatively, you may take the shuttle buses running between the southern beaches and Lovina. From Lovina, it takes 45 minutes to get to the Pura Ulun Danu, while from Ubud, it is a 1.5 hours drive and from Kuta, a 2 hours drive. In case you decide to drive, there is also a spacious park and two restaurants."
11,Kelimutu Volcano,"Kelimutu, Indonesia",Three wildly colorful calderas top this otherworldly volcano chain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kelimutu-volcano,"Lakes, volcanoes, and colors are all on impressive display at the Kelimutu Volcano, an otherworldly series of geologic cauldrons that hold lakes of startling brilliance. 50 miles from the town of Moni on the Indonesian Island of Flores is Kelimutu Volcano and its three summit craters containing their three lakes. The westernmost of the lakes, Tiwu Ata Mbupu (Lake of Old People), is blue, while Tiwu Nuwa Muri Koo Fai (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) is green, and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanged Lake) is red, the latter two separated only by a crater wall. Historically, the lakes have been the source of minor phreatic eruptions from the 1639 meter high Kelimutu volcano. In addition to being three different colors, the lakes’ color varies on a periodic basis, likely due to chemical reactions from the minerals in the lake triggered by volcanic gas activity, but no thorough studies have as yet been performed. That the three lakes are of the same volcano and are at the same crest, yet have different colors, is incredibly rare and of extreme interest to geologists. The Kelimutu Volcano is one of nature’s most stunning displays of color and chemistry and has attracted a number of photographers and tourists over the years. So long as it never erupts, this candy-colored mountain is just a gentle giant.",Moni is a four-hour drive from the Maumere airport or a three-hour drive from the Ende airport.
12,Luhur Uluwatu Temple,"Kuta Selatan, Indonesia",This Balinese sea temple is thought to be guarded by the hundreds of monkeys that live around it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/luhur-uluwatu-temple,"One of the sacred sea temples that are said to create a visually unbroken chain along the Bali coast, the Luhur Uluwatu Temple is a gorgeous, historic pagoda site that is said to be protected by the mischievous monkeys that live in the surrounding forest. A temple structure of some kind is said to have existed on the cliff where Luhur Uluwatu now resides, long before the current structure was developed. The structures, including a lovely cliffside pagoda and crumbling stone arches, are thought to have been built around the 11th century. The structure is built right up to the edge of a sea cliff that drops 230 feet down into the ocean. Walls along the cliffside prevent visitors stunned by the incredible view of the sunset from plummeting off the edge. Like Tanah Lot (which can be seen from the top of the cliff), another Balinese sea temple that is said to protect Bali from malevolent sea spirits, Luhur Uluwatu has protective animals. As the isolated Tanah Lot is overrun with sea snakes, Luhur Uluwatu is rotten with monkeys. Taking roost in the temple itself and the surrounding vegetation, the monkeys of Uluwatu are known to nab any loose possessions that visitors might have on display, often only trading them back for pieces of fruit. They have been known to rip shiny earrings out of visitors’ ears and run away with them, or steal food right out of visitors’ hands. These beasts are said to be the spiritual protectors of the temple, although their main weapon seems to be annoyance. Spirit monkeys or no, the Luhur Uluwatu Temple is a majestic link in a chain of beautiful sea temples. Just be sure to hold on to your belongings.","A taxi from Kuta to Uluwatu will take 30-40 minutes and cost about 150,000Rp one way. From Nusa Dua, it is a 45 minute drive. It is advisable to hire a car to visit this temple, since you may also visit other places in Bali along with it."
13,Jembatan Akar,"West Sumatra, Indonesia",This Sumatran root bridge took almost 30 years to knit itself together.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jembatan-akar,"Extending over the Indonesian Batang Bayang River, the slowly growing Jembatan Akar root bridge is made entirely out of the naturally growing roots of two banyan trees that have been slowly cultivated to knit into a walkable span. The span (Jembatan Akar means “root bridge”) was first conceived of in 1890 by a local teacher who wanted his students from a village across the river to have an easier time getting to his classes. To start the bridge, he put a bamboo frame in place and began wrapping the ever-growing aerial roots of the large banyan trees on either side of the water along the frame. Ever so slowly, the bridge began to take shape. The project took 26 years of carefully tended growth to become sturdy enough to support anyone. The 100-foot span has since been shored up and reinforced with wooden planks and metal cables as well as becoming stronger year after year as the massive roots of the still-living trees continue to grow. Guide lines have also been added to provide additional support for visitors. Unfortunately the original creator of the bridge is no longer alive to see what has grown from his simple idea, but thousands of visitors and commuters each year have him to thank for creating one of the most curious bridges in the world.","The bridge is up in the mountains, south east of Padang. Drive south from Padang until Ps. Baharoe and head north towards Kotobarapak. If you follow the valley north towards Rawang you will be on the right lines. The coordinates are accurate."
14,Millennium Bridge,"Abiansemal, Indonesia","One of the largest bamboo bridges in Asia, located right next to a bamboo school.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/millennium-bridge,"One of the largest bamboo bridges in Asia is part of an even larger effort in Sibang Kaja, Bali, to combine modern ideas about green living and traditional uses of bamboo. The Millennium Bridge extends 75 feet (23 meters) from one side of the Ayung River to the other. It is connected to the Green School, an ecologically sustainable complex that’s also made out of bamboo, as well as mud and local grasses. Nearby, there is a community of bamboo houses. These projects, created by the team at IBUKU, an organization dedicated to beautiful and natural building, demonstrate how bamboo can be used as a renewable alternative to concrete or steel, to which it has comparable strength, though is more susceptible to the elements. The bridge, which has a floor area of 230 square feet (70 square meters), took eight months to construct, and was completed in December of 2011. The roof of the covered bridge is inspired by the architecture of the Minangkabau people of Indonesia. In addition to being a means of crossing the Ayung River, the Millennium Bridge can also be rented as a scenic place for events. Up to 30 people can be accommodated on the bridge.",
15,Kampung Warna-Warni Jodipan (Village of Color),"Malang, Indonesia",This Indonesian village was revitalized by a vibrant rainbow paint job.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kampung-warnawarni-village-of-color,"South of the city center in Malang, Indonesia, rows upon rows of monotonous white houses with brown roofs suddenly transform into a rainbow of vibrant colors bursting at every corner. What was formerly an impoverished village called Kampung Jodipan was transformed into an oasis of color and art, a project that has delighted visitors and revitalized the local community. The village of Kampung Warna-Warni (Indonesian for “Village of Color”) was once drab and polluted, lacking the economic resources required to build a healthy community. But eight event management students from a nearby university lent a helping hand by applying their class skills to the real world. The students partnered with a local paint company looking to do a social responsibility project, which donated over 6,000 pounds of colorful paint, and voila, a hueless city got a brilliant new paint job. Inspired by the favelas of Rio, every square inch of the rainbow village is coated in color, ranging from pastels of green and orange to pink and yellow. The bridge nearby the village is also painted, its beams erupting in magnificent blues and purples. Although it may seem like the paint job would benefit visitors more than those actually living in the village, the makeover has revitalized the community. The beautiful colors improved the village’s standard of living by drawing in new tourist dollars, and the beauty of the colorful houses has inspired many community members to improve the sanitation of their river. Kampung Jodipan’s experiment was so successful with selfie takers, it inspired several other projects throughout Indonesia, including next door neighbor Kampung Tridi (famous for 3D murals) and Kampung Pelangi (Rainbow Village) in Randusari.",Kampung Jodipan is connected to Kampung Tridi by a colorful bridge. Admission fees for each village are separate.

On the night of March 16th each year, the day before the annual Nyepi festival, locals celebrate by parading huge, impressively handcrafted Ogoh-Ogoh figures before setting them on fire. The demons take the form of figures from Hindu legends, and the ritual is based on a tradition to banish evil spirits. Many of the figures from the parade are displayed throughout the rest of the year here in the Ogoh-Ogoh museum. The work that goes into building the mythological monsters, which can get up to 20 feet tall, is remarkable. And the over-the-top expressions and poses (some quite graphic) make visiting this museum feel like you have stumbled onto a set of a horror movie.","A great addition if you are visiting the Mengwi Temple which is close by.

17,Tirta Gangga Water Palace,"Abang, Indonesia",Sacred waters rescued from the wrath of a volcano.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tirta-gangga-water-palace,"Walking amongst the manicured lawns, pools and beastly statuary of the Tirta Gangga water temple in Bali, it is hard to imagine the ruined state they were in not that long ago. Construction on the gardens began in 1948, led by the last Raja of Karangasem (under the Dutch colonial rule). Built as a labor of love, the raja could often be seen getting his hands dirty with the local workers, creating a carefully arranged garden out of the rough hillside surrounding a holy natural spring.Everything came to a dramatic halt in February 1963, when Mount Agung erupted explosively. Although spared from the lava flow, earthquakes and smothering ash devastated the gardens, killing the plants and trees. In the wake of the eruption the property was abandoned, and by the time the staff returned the gardens had been looted, the plants dead and covered in ash. For the next decade and a half, the gardens declined into further ruin.An ambitious restoration process began in 1979, and was extended by the raja’s grandson until the gardens were returned to their former glory.",Located approximately fives miles north of Amlapura.
18,Bali's (Other) Abandoned Plane,"Kuta, Indonesia",The wing of this deserted Boeing 737 almost touches the Dunkin' Donuts next door.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balis-abandoned-plane-by-dunkin-donuts,"If you’re craving donuts while exploring the southern tip of Bali, you might be pointed in the direction of the Dunkin’ Donuts on the Ngurah Rai Bypass. Upon arrival, you may be surprised to see an abandoned Boeing 737 sitting in an empty lot next door. No one seems to know for sure how a Boeing 737 ended up in Kedonganan in Kuta, Southern Bali. It’s in a built-up area known for seafood restaurants, located a mile or so south of Ngurah Rai International Airport (and clearly visible on Google Maps). The 737 has apparently sat there since 2007. Most locals claim that the owner bought the Boeing to turn it into a tourist-friendly restaurant, but ran out of money and later abandoned it in an otherwise empty lot. Others say it was meant to be turned into a home. Either way, there it sits, held up on stilts, its tail clearly visible from the street. Its engines are missing and the turbines not boarded up, its right wing stretching out above a wide alleyway and almost touching the Dunkin’ Donuts next door. Strange, yes. Unique? Well, not quite. There’s actually another abandoned Boeing 737 about five miles to the south, located in an old quarry just off the Raya Nusa Dua Selatan Highway. They don’t seem to have any connection to each other, beyond the fact that both have become strange tourist attractions in their own right. Maybe it’s a Bali thing…",
19,Symon's Art Zoo,Indonesia,"Exotic, erotic, and esoteric, one artist's live-in Bali gallery brings a splash of color and madness to its surroundings.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/symon-s-art-zoo,"A bizarre and wonderful home, come studio, come gallery on the island of Bali, Symon’s Art Zoo is one man’s slightly skewed vision of the world, told in bright colors, grotesque caricature, and erotic sculpture. Located in the Tejakula, Buleleng region, north Bali, American artist Symon has turned his home into a phantasmagoria of art and imagery. Every wall, ceiling and surface from the inside to the outside has been painted a loud color, not that its easy to tell what with the countless framed pictures crammed onto almost every available inch of space. The outside of Symon’s home is arguably even more impressive, with a huge blue religious figure lounging outside his front door, and a large red phallus statue on display. As the gallery is also his home, Symon can sometimes be found on the site and is generally more than happy to discuss the process and history of his prolific work. He is also in the business of selling his art, so if you stop by, bring some cash as there is usually a hard sell at the end.",
20,Prehistoric Cave Art of Maros Pangkep,"Bantimurung, Indonesia","These 40,000-year-old stenciled hands are older than the famous cave art in France and Spain.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prehistoric-cave-art-of-maros-pangkep,"A torch beam finds a stencil of a hand, its ochre outline surprisingly vibrant given its age. Next to it, a sketch of a babirusa—a type of wild “pig-deer” found in Indonesia—shows such attention to detail that the gender of the animal (female) is still clear nearly 36,000 years after its creation. It’s thought to be the oldest known example of figurative art in the world. The Pleistocene-era rock art is spread throughout the karst caves within the Maros and Pangkep regions in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Researchers from Australia’s Griffith University used uranium series dating and found that one of the handprints was roughly 40,000 years old. The collection of paintings, which includes the handprint and the babirusa, contains artwork that is slightly older than the images found in European caves. The rock art’s ancient age shattered the preexisting notion among many Western archaeologists and historians that the cave art originated in modern-day Europe. While little-known, these Indonesian cave drawings are even older than the famous stenciled caves in France and Spain. But though it wasn’t celebrated until recently, the cave art wasn’t unknown. H.R Van Heekeren, a Dutch archaeologist, documented the figures and published his work in 1950. However, the paintings were deemed to be of no real significance and subsequently no additional exploration was done until nearly 60 years later. The purpose behind the rock art is unclear. It’s commonly thought that sites with rock art are ceremonial, but there’s no actual evidence to say whether this is truly the case. One theory is that the rock art was an early library cataloging the animals and fish eaten by the people who dwelled here. Another theory is that the stenciled hands may have more symbolic meanings, such as protecting a house, expressing a person’s connection to the place, or attempting to communicate with the spiritual realm. Getting to the karsts requires boating down the narrow river before an hour long walk through rice paddies. A monkey or two may shriek from the tops of the strange palm trees—described by the guide as “shrimpfingers”—before disappearing. Nearby, cows laze and graze under the monolith overhangs and ducks forage for huge snails in the rice paddies.","The GPS coordinates lead the Leang Petta Kere cave, which is located within the region and contains prehistoric cave art. Visitors must arrange their visit by contacting the University of Hasnuddin or another Indonesian University. Take bottles of water and wear suitable clothing and shoes. It cann be done as a day walk.

21,Borobudur,"Magelang, Indonesia",Hundreds of Buddhas in a re-discovered Indonesian temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/borobudur-or-baradubur,"Built in the late 8th century, Borobudur temple took an army of workers and 60,000 cubic meters of lava rock to construct. Yet despite its massive size and elaborate rows of Buddha statues, it was mysteriously abandoned during the 14th century and sat in the jungle, undiscovered until 1814. In the style of a step-pyramid, the temple has six square bases, topped with three circular layers and a large main stupa. Pilgrims and visitors alike follow a guided path to the top of the complex, which leads them around the monument a number of times before reaching the peak. Along the way, the path is marked by 500 Buddha statues and thousands of reliefs that depict daily life in Buddhist Java. At one point in time, Borobudur was the center of Buddhist life in Indonesia, but the adoption of Islam led to a complete abandonment in the 14th century. During the period of British administration in Java, the monument was rediscovered by a Governor-General, and he led the charge over the next 30 years to fully excavate the site and reveal the mysterious lost temple. Since that time, restoration has become a priority and Borobudur is now protected as a UNESCO site. Despite efforts to protect the temple, a few stupas were nearly destroyed during a terrorist attack in 1985. As the site is quite near to a few active volcanos, the temple has also received its share of volcanic dust and earthquake events. The effort for conservation has always been made after similar events happened.","Most people visit Borobudur temple from Yogyakarta as a side or day trip. But it is also well recommended to stay the night at the city itself. From Yogyakarta to Borobudur, there is a public bus connecting the cities. If you are doing a day trip, it is advisable to hire a car along with a driver to get there and back. Alternatively, if you are coming from the west side, catch the public bus from Wonosobo heading towards Yogyakarta and drop off at Borobudur. If you are coming from Jakarta, the easiest way is to first take the direct train to Yogyakarta, and then do a side trip to Borobudur after. The temple is open to public from 6:00 AM to 5:00 PM but only those who get a special pass from the Manohara Hotel can get in before 6:00 AM. Note that you don't need to be a guest of this hotel to get the special pass though."
22,Kawah Ijen,"Banyuputih, Indonesia",Think you have a tough job? Try carrying 200 kilos through a cloud of sulfur down the side of a volcano.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kawah-ijen,"It is an American pastime to complain about one’s job. A bad boss, late hours, poor pay; there is always plenty to complain about. However even the worst office 9-5 in the U.S. is a cakewalk compared to being a sulfur miner on Kawah Ijen, an 8,660-foot active volcano in East Java, Indonesia, which bears a certain similarity to Dante’s vision of hell. Working on the side of the active volcano in temperatures surpassing 100 degrees Fahrenheit, workers use metal poles to hack out chunks of elemental sulfur. Using ceramic pipes, they channel the gases which drain out as liquid red sulfur which then hardens into the yellow chunks the miners carry out. To do all this, the workers must stand near a live sulfur vent pouring out masses of the noxious, choking gas (the air carries H2SO4 and CaSO4, which are both toxic). The workers then load baskets with 150-200 pounds (68-91 kilos) of sulfur chunks and haul them up 200 meters to the crater rim, and then down three kilometers of traile and 1500 meters of elevation to the weighing station where the sulfur is sold to be used in vulcanizing rubber and bleaching sugar. The reward: around US$13 a day. One of the problems with improving the men’s situation is that they are all essentially freelance, with no direct employer, so the only safety standards are those the men impose on themselves, which are very few. The men generally work without (expensive) gas masks, despite the fact that prolonged exposure to the noxious fumes can cause respiratory problems similar to severe asthma. And that’s not to mention the sheer backbreaking nature of the work. One reason the men work in the mine, despite having a life expectancy of about 30, is that it pays marginally better than being a farmer. There is a nearby crater lake, which from afar looks like it might be nice for a cool dip after a hard day of mining, but one would be seriously mistaken. The lake is a 90-degree pool of sulfuric acid in which nothing lives, and which would kill any that dared to swim in it. Birds have been reported to drop dead from the lake’s fumes and to fall into it if they fly overhead. There is no respite to be taken in the harsh volcanic world of Kawah Ijen. Paradoxically, the unusually high sulfur concentrations that feed Kawah Ijen’s mining industry also result in brilliant blue flames that erupt from the volcano and flow lava-like down the mountain. The spectacular display, visible most nights, occurs when the volcano’s sulfuric gases reach the surface and ignite. Burning liquid sulfur creates the appearance of blue lava streaming down the mountainside. From a distance, Kawah Ijen appears not as an unforgiving workplace but as one more of nature’s odd and beautiful phenomena.","The nearest airport is the Banyuwangi airport with limited flights from Jakarta or Surabaya. From the airport, it's a 2-hour drive. For visitors from Bali, fast boat operates from Jimbaran Bali to Boom Beach in Banyuwangi taking approximately 2-hours. From Banyuwangi, you can choose from all kinds of vehicles such as 4WD or motorbike or car to get to the starting point of the hike up to Ijen Crater.Alternatively, you can go via Bondowoso from either the northern or southern coast. This is the closer but steeper way and would require a 4WD to access. After that, you will walk for another 8km to Pos Paltuding, the starting point of the hike to Ijen Crater. The cost and difficulty of this route make it the less popular way."
23,Liang Bua Cave,"Boawae, Indonesia","A real-life ""hobbit"" cave in Flores, Indonesia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/liang-bua-cave,"A new “hobbit” species of human was found in the remote Indonesian cave of Liang Bua. This limestone cave has yielded some of the most important finds in modern anthropology. The remains of two “hobbit” people, as the media calls them, were found here in 2003. Homo floresiensis, a homo (or human) genus was discovered here by Mike Norwood, professor of anthropology at the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. Norwood and others have shown that this human existed as recently as 12,000 years ago, possibly putting this species in contact with local homo sapiens. What makes H. floresiensis so remarkable is that they accomplished the same things as their larger H. sapiens cousins, such as making fire and hunting in cooperation with each other, while being less than four feet tall and having brains approximately one-half to one-third of the size of H. sapiens. At this point, this cave is the only site where the “hobbits” of Flores, Indonesia, have been found.","The cave is located north of Ruteng on the island of Flores in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. It is best to hire a taxi or a bemo to get there. Be aware that the road to the cave is in poor condition."
24,Pura Goa Lawah,Indonesia,"This sacred cave temple is home to thousands of bats and according to legend, a giant snake king.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pura-goa-lawah,"One of nine sacred temples on the island of Bali, the cave temple known as Pura Goa Lawah is home to thousands of bats, but if local legend is to be believed, it also hides a river of healing waters and a titanic snake wearing a crown. Believed to have been created sometime around 1007 by an Indonesian saint, the ancient temple structures built around the cave entrance are still ministered to and provided with prayer on a daily basis. While the site had no name when the temple was built, it gets its current title due to the thousands of bats that cling to the ceiling and walls of the natural chasm, “Goa” meaning “cave” and “Lawah” meaning “bat.” It is thought that the cave may extend all the way through the mountain right to a nearby town. Legend goes that the dark recesses of the tunnel are home to a mythical snake king known as Vasuki, a massive naga that wears a crown on his head. He is said to live on the copious amounts of bats in the cavern. Yet another legend claims that a river of miraculous healing waters rushes through the depths of the cave. While the extent of the sacred cave has never been explored, stunningly intricate temple structures have been placed at the cave mouth, which are paid pilgrimage to on a daily basis in full view of the countless slumbering bats hanging around the rim. The Pura Goa Lawah is also host to a yearly festival where devout worshippers from all around come to pray at the mouth of this impressive bat cave.",
25,Kampung Tridi,"Blimbing, Indonesia",Bright Indonesian villages painted in a rainbow of competing color schemes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kampung-tridi,"Wandering this narrow streets of Kampung Tridi is like stepping into a whimsical world of color. Umbrellas seem to dangle in midair above the walkway into the village, where eye-popping 3D murals abound. Like Kampung Warna-Warni, the colorful village across the river, the neighborhood’s buildings were slathered with a rainbow array of bright paint. But Kampung Tridi took things a step further. Its residents painted huge murals on its walls, many of which almost appear three-dimensional, earning it the nickname “Indonesia’s 3D Village.” The murals are quickly becoming selfie spots for tourists drawn into the lively locale. People have fun posing beneath enormous animals or standing alongside popular cartoon figures that almost look as though they’re reaching out from the walls. Kampung Tridi isn’t the only painted village within the city. The first was Kampung Warna-Warni (Painted Village), which was painted in 2015. In early 2017, Kampung Putih (White Village) was painted with white walls, grey roofs, and green accents. The newest painting project was Kampung Biru Arema, a blue and purple village completed in early 2018. These painted villages do more than just please the eye. The bright, quirky paint jobs are meant to help revitalize the communities. By bringing in tourists (and their money), the unusual art helps boost the local economies.","Warna-Warni, Tridi, and Biru Arema villages are adjacent with clear views available from traffic on nearby bridges and passing passenger trains. Kampung Putih is a couple miles to the northeast."
26,Amed Beach,"Abang, Indonesia",The inky volcanic sand leads to reefs teeming with aquatic life waiting to be discovered by snorkelers and divers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amed-beach,"Amed Beach has a second name, one that becomes clearer once you walk to the coast and notice the dark volcanic sand. The gorgeous beach is also dubbed “Black Beauty” for its inky coastline. “Amed” refers to the Bali coast that stretches for about 8.5 miles and incorporates a cluster of seven villages called Amed, Jemeluk, Bunutan, Lipah, Selang, Banyuning, and Aas. In the past, these were mainly a collection of fishing villages and salt farms. Now, the area also beckons honeymooners looking to escape Bali’s more touristy spots. The reefs along the coast also attract divers and snorkelers. The water teems with various marine life. An aquatic adventure here will likely reveal tropical fish, sea turtles, coral gardens, and perhaps even the occasional shark. You’ll even discover a shipwrecked Japanese patrol boat from World War II. However, the black sand is what makes Amed Beach so remarkably unique from other Bali beaches. The sand’s color is due to the volcanic deposits in the coastal soil. It stays black year-round, a sharp contrast to the gold and white sand that hugs most of Bali’s coastline.","Amed lies on the northeastern tip of Bali, about a three hour drive from the Ngurah Rai International Airport."

The deceased are then put into a stone grave carved out of the cliffside or in coffins hanging from the rocks. A wooden effigy or tau-tau is put up near the grave to look out over the land. The effigies are tightly packed together, with generations of wooden replicas of deceased villagers standing shoulder to shoulder looking down upon trespassers for all eternity.

28,Gunung Padang,"Campaka, Indonesia",These broken shards of ancient ruin may hide an ancient pyramid.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gunung-padang,"In Indonesia there is a hill covered in a mess of stone-age columns, but what lies beneath is possibly one of the oldest structures known to humankind. In 2011, geologist Dr. Danny Hilman Natawidjaja noticed something peculiar about Gunung Padang. The hill isn’t an actual hill, it’s a buried pyramid that may have been built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago. There’s even evidence of human-made chambers that show carbon-dating as far back as 26,000 years. If proven true, this claim could rewrite history as we know it and expose a forgotten civilization. The predominant understanding among historians is that all human civilization began after the last major Ice Age that covered the Earth back in 11,500 BCE. If this pyramid-like structure dates further than 11,500 BCE, then it could prove that Plato’s account of a sunken civilization in Timaeus and Critias was not merely Ancient Greek legend. What secrets lie deep inside Gunung Padang? Only further excavation will tell. Let’s hope the Indonesian government allows Dr. Natawidjaja to continue his research in spite of the outrage and protest to stop any further research from Indonesia’s archaeological establishment. Gunung Padang might join the ranks of Gobekli Tepe, another megalith in Turkey, as one of most important archaeological discoveries in recent history.",

30,Prambanan,"Kecamatan Prambanan, Indonesia",This massive complex is made up of hundreds of smaller temples that date back to the ninth century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prambanan,"According to the records, the first temple in Prambanan was built around the year 850. It is believed that Rakai Pikatan, king of the Sanjaya dynasty Medang Kingdom, had it built partly as a Hindu response to the nearby Buddhist Borobudur, and partly as a marker to commemorate the return of the Sanjaya dynasty to power in Central Java. However, it was Rakai Pikatan’s successor, King Lokapala, who is responsible for expanding the complex to the massive scale that it has become famous for today. Located on the island of Java, Prambanan is one of the largest Hindu temple complexes in Southeast Asia and the largest in Indonesia. It is not a single structure, but instead hundreds of stone temples in varying shapes and sizes. Several of those temples sit on an elevated courtyard, surrounded by more than 200 smaller ones. At the center stands 47-meter (154-foot) tall temple. An inscription on the oldest temple, Lara Jonggrang, shows that it was built in honor of Lord Shiva, and it is divided into two main terraces. On the higher terrace are the shrines dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, and on the lower terrace are smaller shrines. Reliefs of the epic Ramayana can be found throughout. The Prambanan complex consists of three zones, and Lara Jonggrang is located at the physical and symbolic heart of the inner, holiest zone, which houses eight temples in all. The middle zone consists of 224 shrines, most of which bore the brunt of earthquakes and looting, but some have been restored. The outer zone was once surrounded by a wall, but the function of this area is a matter of speculation. For reasons that remain unclear, Prambanan was largely abandoned about 100 years after its completion. Many of the temples collapsed as a result of natural disasters, including volcanic eruptions and a powerful earthquake in the 16th century. Over time, the jungle reclaimed the ruins of the elaborate temple compound. In 1811, Thomas Stamford Raffles, a British surveyor, stumbled on the ruins of Prambanan while Java was under the administration of the British Empire. As colonial history unfolded, not much value was placed on Prambanan, which became the object of extensive looting. Eventually, in 1930, restoration began. To date, restoration is still ongoing.","Tickets cost $25 for foreign visitors and around $4 for Indonesians.

Hot, sulfuric mud has been continually gushing from the ground in Sidoarjo, East Java ever since. The steaming pool of mud already covers more than 25 square kilometers, and is growing at an estimated 50,000 cubic meters–the equivalent of a dozen Olympic swimming pools–each day, swallowing up homes as it expands. Scientists expect the mud volcano to continue erupting for perhaps another 30 years.","The mud volcano is located south of the center of Sidoarjo, the town being directly south of the major eastern Java city of Surabaya. The mud volcano is bordered on the west side by Route 1/Jalan Raya Malang-Surabaya. There are local rail stops on the north (Dusun Ketapang, Jl.

It is home to the longest hiking route on the island of Java, which is about 63 kilometers in length. The ascent takes six days and five nights. The massive volcanic complex that Mount Argopuro is part of dominates the landscape between the Raung and Lamongan volcanoes in East Java. The mountain has not had a major eruption within at least the last 500 years—though there was an unverified report of an eruption in 1597. In addition, Mount Argopuro is currently a mountain that is rarely visited by climbers because it has been closed for more than a year, so many routes are still “virgin” because they are covered with shrubs, fallen trees and have to cut down bushes to break through the path.","You can do the trip to Mount Argopuro by taking a bus to Besuki City and then an ojek to the Baderan Post, which is a post to start the climb. For the use of private vehicles, you can go directly to Baderan Post, but make sure you use a 4WD vehicle considering the difficult terrain. Based on the level of difficulty Argopuro has a rating of number 9, which is one level below Mount Semeru (Mahameru Peak, The highest mountain on the Java Island). The long route at Argopuro requires bringing sufficient supplies, while the terrain is covered with fallen trees, wild trees and intermittent paths that cause climbers to get lost frequently."

34,Bali's Abandoned Plane,"Kuta Selatan, Indonesia",Someone left a Boeing 737 in a field in southern Bali.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-plane-in-bali,"Down in southern Bali sits an abandoned Boeing 737. It’s not at an airport or an airplane boneyard. Instead, it sits in a field near some kind of limestone quarry, and no one quite knows how it got there. The abandoned plane is located near the southern coast of the Bukit Peninsula in Bali. It’s just off the Raya Nusa Dua Selatan Highway and only five minutes from the popular and picturesque Pandawa beach. In other words, it’s not exactly hidden away from the world. What makes it even stranger is that no one seems to know how it got there. You’d think someone would notice the arrival of a Boeing 737 in a field near a fairly major road, but…no. Some locals say that the plane, which has no livery or notable insignia, was destined to be converted into a tourist-friendly restaurant. Apparently, however, the owner ran out of money and left his Boeing 737 to slowly rust surrounded by a shabby hut and a few shipping containers. Apart from that, little is known about abandoned aircraft. It may have been purchased and reassembled where it now stands, which would explain, at least in part, why no one saw it arrive. The plane has now become a tourist attraction in its own right. And, strangely, it’s not the only abandoned plane you can visit on the Indonesian island. About five miles north sits another abandoned Boeing 737, right next to a Dunkin’ Donuts. In mid-2018, the plane was opened as an event venue. As of October 21, 2021, (if you have Google Earth Pro), you can see that this aircraft, and at least one other, are being dismantled as many parts have been removed and the fuselage has been moved to a different location closer to the road.","The abandoned Boeing 737 in the south of the Bukit Peninsula is easy enough to reach, as long as you can spot it from the road. The view of the plane is obstructed from the highway, so you need to keep your eyes open, or you could easily miss it. When you come across a wall of sea containers on the side of the road, you are have arrived. You can see the plane by climbing up onto the containers that surround it. Or, for a better view, head slightly further down the road where you’ll find a path that leads up above the plane. You’ll have to pay a small fee to enter, as the plane is on private property."
