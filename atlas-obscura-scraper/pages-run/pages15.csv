0,Ghibli Museum,"Tokyo, Japan",A magical place that lets you play in and explore the world of Studio Ghibli.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ghibli-museum,"Situated in the suburbs of Mitaka, the Ghibli Museum is both a showcase for the famed animation studio and a playground for children of any age. Known in the west for its films such as Spirited Away, the museum’s design was informed by Hayao Miyazaki’s personal vision. He didn’t want it to become yet another boring pile of exhibits. Instead, he “put it together as if it were a film,” creating a series of rooms with motifs from every single piece of animation he had produced or found interesting, visitable in any order. The result is like stepping into the wizard’s cottage whilst he is away, with artist’s materials, animation cells, and sketchbooks preserved alongside overflowing ashtrays and cardboard boxes filled with reusable pencil stubs. The motifs begin when you step off the bright yellow bus - the bus stop is in the shape of the studio’s mascot, Totoro. One particular delight is the room that showcases different methods of animation, which draws your gaze from the zoetrope near the entrance, on past the moving wooden figures, pausing to see the stop-motion carousel spin up, then stopping dead at the Heath Robinson-like film projector in a glass case to view the “evolution of man” movie at different points in the projector. Another, sadly for under-12s only, is the playroom that holds a plush Catbus complete with chuckable Soot Sprites. The main attraction is the short film that can only be seen in the Museum in its tiny theatre. Rotated out every day, they are in Japanese (without subtitles), though it is often easy enough to follow regardless. You receive your ticket when you arrive, and may have to wait for 5-15 minutes to get seats. Photography is prohibited inside the building except in the rooftop garden, which is dominated by a huge bronze figure from Laputa: Castle in the Sky. There is also a cafe, gift shop, and bookshop inside, and a picnic park outside where families can sit under the cherry blossoms in March/April.","Access is strictly limited - only 200 admissions per day for overseas visitors. Tickets must be purchased in advance; there is no ticket office at the museum.  Tickets go on sale on the web in advance beginning on the 10th of the month beforehand, starting at 10 a.m. and sell out quickly, within days or hours. Tickets can also be purchased in Japan at Loppi kiosks at Lawson convenience stores. The best way to get to it is by train and bus. Train: Take the JR Chuo Main Line west from Shinjuku Station to Mitaka Station to catch the bus. Most large stations will have maps in both Japanese and English. (Do NOT go to Mita Station on the Yamanote Line, which is entirely different.) Bus: From Mitaka Station, go to the South Exit and move towards the bus stands nearby and slightly to your left. Buy the ticket to the museum from the attendant and wait for the museum bus, which is unmistakable - bright yellow and covered with cartoon characters. Alternatively, if you have a map to guide you, you can get off at Kichijoji Station (one stop before Mitaka Station) and walk 1.4 kilometers (just under a mile) through Inokashira Park to reach the museum at the far edge of the park."
1,Sagano Bamboo Forest,"Kyoto, Japan",The sound of swaying stalks in this stunning grove has been named a governmentally recognized sound.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sagano-bamboo-forest,"Growing tall on the edges of Kyoto, the Sagano Bamboo Forest is a once tranquil nature spot that is now a series of tourist-packed pathways, but if you can escape the sounds of camera shutters and boorish visitors, you’ll hear the rustling, creaking, and swaying of one of Japan’s governmentally recognized soundscapes. The Sagano Bamboo Forest is situated northwest of Kyoto in Japan near the Tenryū-ji Temple in the Arashiyama district. The region experiences unpredictable weather with a rather cool climate and bright sunlight. In this region the summers are short, hot, and mostly cloudy. The winters are very cold, windy, and partly cloudy. It is also wet year-round Only 30 minutes or so from Kyoto city center, the towering bamboo forest is an almost shocking contrast to the urbanity surrounding it. Wooden paths weave through the dense thicket of tall bamboo stalks that reach dozens of feet into the sky, creating a canopy. As the wind passes through the tightly packed plants, the wood bends and creaks, the leaves rustle, and the trunks knock together, creating a peaceful sound like almost nothing else. That is, when the hordes of tourists aren’t drowning it out. The meditative natural noise is so lovely, in fact, that Japan’s Ministry of the Environment designated the location’s aural pleasures as one of the country’s “100 Soundscapes of Japan,” an initiative designed to encourage the local population to get out and appreciate the country’s acoustic wonders. If visitors can find a time to visit the bamboo forest when it is relatively empty the combination of visual beauty and auditory calm may be one of a kind. There is no word, however, on how the place smells.",
2,Wisteria Tunnel,"Kitakyushu, Japan",An exquisite tunnel of cascading flowers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wisteria-tunnel,"It’s practically impossible to walk through the pastel-colored passageway of wisteria flowers at the Kawachi Fuji Gardens in Kitakyushu without imagining an elegant fairy princess and her one-horned white steed prancing alongside you. A member of the pea family, wisteria is an ornamental vine, wildly popular in both Eastern and Western gardens for its graceful hanging flowers and its ornate, winding branches. Easily trained, the woody vines tend to reach maturity within a few years, at which point they bloom in cascades of long, lavender flowers of varying pastel shades. There are about 150 flowering wisteria plants of roughly 20 species that create this famous colorful flower tunnel. Make sure to visit in late April or Early May, during the “Fuji Matsuri,” or “Wisteria Festival,” when the magical tunnel is in full bloom. Because many visitors come to the gardens during the blooming season, you need to book your time slot in advance. Arrive at any other time of year, and its appearance will be a disheartening mass of lifeless, twisted branches.","Take the Shinkansen to Kokura station. Change to the JR Kagoshima line for Yahata station. From Yahata station, take the Nishitetsu bus to Kawachi Syougakou mae (Kawachi Elementary School). Buses only run once an hour or so, and the stop is not close. A taxi might be a better, though expensive, option."
3,Cat Island,"Ishinomaki, Japan","On Japan's Tashirojima Island, cats are king.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cat-island,"On the island of Tashirojima in the Miyagi Prefecture, the cats outnumber people, and the people like it that way. It’s no accident that the cats who inhabit Tashirojima—or what has become known as “Cat Island”—in Japan have come to be the island’s primary residents. Cats have long been thought by the locals to represent luck and good fortune, and doubly so if you feed and care for them. Thus, the cats are treated like kings, and although most are feral because keeping them as “pets” is generally considered inappropriate, they are well-fed and well-cared-for. Despite this, luck and fortune haven’t exactly come to the human residents of “Cat Island.” In the last 50 years, the human population of the island has dwindled from 1,000 to fewer than 100. As more and more people have shunned the island as it became dominated by felines, the people that have remained have become ever more protective of the cats. Currently, dogs are not allowed on the island to protect the well-being of the cats—and presumably any dog foolish enough to venture onto an island full of feral cats. There is even a small cat shrine (Neko-jinja 猫神社 in Japanese) in the middle of the island to commemorate an accidentally killed cat. The cats may end up bringing luck after all, however. Tourism has been picking up as the island has become an attraction for curious travelers, thanks to all of those cats.","It can be difficult to find cat food on the island, so if you opt to bring some treats, drop by a convenience store before taking the ferry. This is not the only cat island in Japan. Another popular spot is Aoshima island in Ehime Prefecture with about 150 cats and about a dozen human residents."
4,Jigokudani Monkey Park,"Yamanouchi, Japan",Hot springs monkey spa in the middle of Hell's Valley.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jigokudani-park-japan,"So named because of the area’s eerie bubbling hot springs, harsh landscape, and snowy frigid climate, Jigokudani translates to “Hell’s Valley”. Snow covers the ground more than four months out of every year and the valley is lined with jagged cliffs, jutting over 2,500 feet into the air. The park is most famous for its population of Japanese Macaques, also known as Snow Monkeys, the most northern living non-human primates. Sometime in the early ’60s these clever characters decided to test the waters of the natural hot springs, and they’ve descended from the forest to warm up in their steamy discovery every winter since. Some of the hot springs even reach temperatures above 122 degrees Fahrenheit, which is perfect for warming monkeys along with visitors to the region. Although not technically a religious site, the Snow Monkeys are popular in Japanese fables and are believed to be messengers of the Shinto mountain gods and rivers. Although the region is remote, there is no doubt that seeing monkeys on a spa retreat is probably a surreal and spiritual experience all on its own.","Jigokudani Monkey Park is located near Yamanouchi town. The closest large city is Nagano, which is about 40 to 45 minutes away. You can find an exact list of bus times to/from the snow monkey park at the Nagano train station. An express bus from Nagano is 1,400 yen to the park entrance. You can also take a local train from Nagano to Yudanaka Station and from there take a local bus or taxi to the park entrance. From the park entrance it is a 1.6 km walk to the park itself. Snow boots and jackets can be rented from the information center, as the ground can be slippery in the winter. Monkeys are fed during the morning, bath in the hot springs after, then head off into the night to sleep, so it's best to visit early to mid-day to get the view of both the feeding frenzy and the bathing. The park can be visited year round but winter is the best time to visit when everything is covered in snow."
5,Vampire Café,"Tokyo, Japan",A taste of the macabre Tokyo's ritzy shopping district.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vampire-cafe,"A far cry from the sunny, commercial milieu of Ginza, the Vampire Café begs customers to enter a Gothic paradise, aptly blending tourist kitsch with the decor of Dracula’s VIP room. Covered wall to wall with red velvet, and carefully decorated with a delicate touch of morbid flair, waiters take orders in snappy tuxedos and waitresses in French maid outfits glide across the red floor covered in red blood cells. From the decor to the dishes, every last detail is crafted to create a vast and eerie dining landscape. While sitting at red-covered thrones, diners can sip a dark red aperitif garnished with tiny skulls. The light from candles atop coffins flicker with a supernatural aura powerful enough to make Bram Stoker work up an appetite for more blood-soaked treats as baroque music drones through the dim restaurant. The atmosphere is enough to make patrons forget the lively world of flagship stores and luxury shopping just seven floors below them and sink in their teeth.",
6,The Giant Ghibli Clock,"Tokyo, Japan",Tokyo’s only Vaudeville-cuckoo clock–steampunk-Victorian curio cabinet time piece.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-giant-ghibli-clock-tokyo-japan,"Officially called the “NI-Tele Really BIG Clock,” four or five times a day this wacked-out symphonic mega-machine spins, dances, whirs and clanks. And as a side gig, it also tells the time. The giant clock is in the Shiodome section of Tokyo, at the Nittele Tower (headquarters of Nippon Television). It was designed by Hayao Miyazaki, the renowned director and co-founder of Studio Ghibli, and while it’s not exactly drawn from his 2004 film Howl’s Moving Castle, it’s been likened to the aesthetic of the anime classic. The clock is huge: over 20 tons of copper and steel, three stories high and 60 feet wide. Besides chiming out the time, there are over 30 mechanical vignettes at appointed hours, including cannons, a couple of blacksmiths, a wheel spinner, boiling teapot and two bell-headed piston crankers. They all move in a delicate and industrious ballet, some reminiscent of a cuckoo clock and others like 19th century tin toys. The clock springs to life four times on Monday to Friday, with an extra show on Saturdays and Sundays. Each performance begins about four minutes ahead of the hour, and you can see it from many different spots around the Nippon TV tower. But get as close as you can so you can really see the detail. Anime fan or not, Miyazaki’s clock is crazy with detail.","The clock is located in front of the Nittele Tower (Nippon Television headquarters). It jumps into action every day at noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 .p.m, and there is an extra morning chime on Saturdays and Sundays at 10 a.m. It’s a good idea to get there a few minutes early, so you’re ready when the music begins and the wheels start to turn. Take the Yurikamome Line to the Shiodome station or get off at Shimbashi station where several of the main lines meet."
7,Aokigahara Forest,"Fujinomiya-shi, Japan","A beautiful, dense forest in the shadow of Mount Fuji, with a tragic reputation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aokigahara-suicide-forest,"The Aokigahara forest in Japan has the unfortunate distinction of being a destination for people who are contemplating suicide. Since the 1950s, recorded suicides in the forest have been rising at an increasing rate of between 10 and 30 per year. In 2003, a record number of 105 suicide victims were discovered here. Japanese spiritualists believe that the suicides committed in the forest have permeated Aokigahara’s trees, generating paranormal activity and preventing many who enter from escaping the forest’s depths. Complicating matters further is the common experience of compasses being rendered useless by the rich deposits of magnetic iron in the area’s volcanic soil. Due to the vastness of the forest, desperate visitors are unlikely to encounter anyone once inside the so-called “Sea of Trees,” so the police have mounted signs reading “Your life is a precious gift from your parents,” and “Please consult the police before you decide to die!” on trees throughout. This does not deter determined people from committing suicide in this dense forest. Each year dozens of corpses are found by volunteers who clean the woods, but many are forever lost in the very thick woods. Japanese authorities have discontinued publishing exact suicide numbers in order to avoid making the place even more popular. Contemporary news outlets have noted the recent spike in suicides in the forest, blaming them more on Japan’s economic downturn than on the romantic ending of Seicho Matsumoto’s novel Kuroi Jukai, which revitalized the so-called suicide forest’s popularity among those determined to take their final walk. (The novel culminates in Aokigahara as the characters are driven to joint-suicide.) Locals say they can easily spot the three types of visitors to the forest: trekkers interested in scenic vistas of Mount Fuji, the curious hoping for a glimpse of the macabre, and those souls who don’t plan on leaving. What those hoping to take their lives may not consider is the impact the suicides have on those living near an area famous for being a suicide spot. A local police officer said, “I’ve seen plenty of bodies that have been really badly decomposed, or been picked at by wild animals… There’s nothing beautiful about dying in there.” According to some reports, forest workers must carry the bodies from the forest to the local police station, where they are put in a special room used specifically to house suicide corpses. Some believe that if a corpse is left alone, it is very bad luck for the yurei (ghost) of the suicide victims. Their spirits are said to scream through the night, and that their bodies will move on their own. In January 2018, the forest gained international attention after a YouTuber filmed and broadcast a suicide victim’s body on his popular channel. If you visit, be respectful if you do come across any victims of suicide. Contact the local authorities so they can appropriately handle the situation. It’s a somber place; one where the gravity of the circumstances should not be taken lightly. If you’re struggling with thoughts of suicide, there are international resources available for help. Many of these mental health hotlines are available 24/7 to anyone in distress.","If you're interested in hiking in the forest, it's located approximately two hours' driving time west-southwest from Tokyo. Accessible without a car. Must take the Fujikyu Railway to Kawaguchiko train station then the Retro Bus. Entrance is in the parking lot of the Lake Sai Bat Cave."
8,Sanrio Puroland,"Tokyo, Japan","If Hello Kitty were Mickey Mouse, this would be Disneyland.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sanrio-puroland,"With the growing worldwide appeal of Hello Kitty and her iconically illustrated pack of animal friends it is no wonder that the Sanrio characters even have their own insanely elaborate theme park. Built in 1990, Sanrio Puroland is any Sanrio fan’s dream. Not unlike Disneylands across the globe (including the one in Japan), the bright, loud, and eye-poppingly ornate theme park allows visitors to mix and mingle with their favorite super-deformed animals, not just Hello Kitty. They can visit Badtz Maru the penguin’s cave, Keroppi the frog’s pond, or even Hello Kitty’s own house in which everything is shaped like her head. The effect of walking through a blaring candy-colored cartoon is broken only by the live stage shows and fireworks around each turn, all of which is presented in a distinctly over-the-top and uniquely Japanese style. Of course there are also rides, such as the innocuously named “Sanrio Character Boat Ride,” which is near identical to the It’s A Small World ride at California’s Disneyland, simply seen through a hyperactive pastel lens. Despite the similarities to Mickey Mouse’s various wonderlands, Puroland is still unique among theme parks in its singular devotion to saccharine cuteness. Most people are well aware of Hello Kitty’s influence around the world, but again, much like Disneyland opened visitors’ eyes to their vast world of marketable Western animation beyond their iconic mouse, Puroland proves that Sanrio has just as deep a bench if you can handle the sweetness.","About a 10-minute walk from Tama-Center Station; to get here from central Tokyo, take the Keiō Line train from Shinjuku Station, which should be roughly 35 minutes' ride."
9,Nishiki Market,"Kyoto, Japan",This 700-year-old street food market features baby octopus and soy donuts.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nishiki-market,"Nishiki Market well merits its nickname as “Kyoto’s Kitchen.” It first opened in 1310 as a simple fish market, and has expanded over the centuries to become the best spot for seafood, produce, and local street food in the city. Walking down the packed narrow alleyway your senses are drawn in a hundred different directions. The entire market is just five blocks long, but over 150 stalls, some barely big enough for a chef to stand in, make it feel much bigger. There are traditional delicacies like freshly pounded mochi, Japanese pickles, sweet red beans prepared in a multitude of ways, and of course, Kyoto’s famous tofu. Some stalls will offer free samples, while the more expensive items may cost a few yen.  Just about everything at Nikishi Market will reward an adventurous palate. Baby octopus with a boiled quail egg in its brain cavity, soy donuts, barbecued quail, grilled squid, candied kumquats, and pickled gourds are all for sale, as well as more traditional fare like sushi, tofu, and tea. A few stalls sell non-comestibles as well. The inexplicably various shoe vendors, and Aritsugu, one of Japan’s finest knife-making shops, has had a stall here since the year 1510.","Bring cash, be prepared for large crowds, and come with an empty stomach."
10,Shiratani Unsuikyo Ravine,"Yakushima, Japan","The magical, mossy forest that inspired Princess Mononoke.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shiratani-unsuikyo,"Look closely when walking through the mossy trees of Shiratani Unsuikyo forest–there might be kodama, or tree spirits, nearby. It’s dense with greenery and very quiet, sound absorbed by the thick moss. Gentle creeks trickle over ancient rocks, through the fine selection of cedars only found in Japan , and which are named for it (they are called “yakusugi” or “Yakushima cedars”). There are hiking trails too, some of which date back to the Edo period (the 17th through mid-19th centuries). It is also notable because it served as an inspiration for Studio Ghibli’s Princess Mononoke, which addresses the tension between humans and nature spirits in the forest setting. Lead artist Kazuo Oga was said to have spent many hours sketching the forest in preparation for the film.",Take the one of the Mutsubanda buses from Miyanoura to the stop at Shiratani Unsuikyo park.
11,Gunkanjima Island,"Nagasaki, Japan","Once the most densely populated place in the world, this island is now a ghost town.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gubkanjima-island,"Few places in the world have a history as odd, or as poignant as Gunkanjima’s. The tiny, fortress-like island (also known as “Hashima” or “Battleship Island”) lies just off the coast of Nagasaki. The island is ringed by a seawall, covered in tightly packed buildings, and entirely abandoned - a ghost town that has been completely uninhabited for more than forty years. In the early 1900s, Gunkanjima was developed by the Mitsubishi Corporation, which believed - correctly - that the island was sitting on a rich submarine coal deposit. For almost the next hundred years, the mine grew deeper and longer, stretching out under the seabed to harvest the coal that was powering Japan’s industrial expansion. By 1941, the island, less than one square kilometer in area, was producing 400,000 tonnes of coal per year. And many of those working slavishly in the undersea mine were forced laborers from Korea. Even more remarkable than the mine was the city that had grown up around it. To accommodate the miners, ten-story apartment complexes were built up on the tiny rock - a high-rise maze linked together by courtyards, corridors, and stairs. There were schools, restaurants, and gaming houses, all encircled by the protective seawall. The island became known as “Midori nashi Shima,” the island without green. Amazingly, by the mid-1950s, it housed almost six thousand people, giving it the highest population density the world has ever known. And then the coal ran out. Mitsubishi closed the mine, everyone left, and this island city was abandoned, left to revert back to nature. The apartments began to crumble, and for the first time, in the barren courtyards, green things started to grow. Broken glass and old newspapers blew over the streets. The sea-breeze whistled through the windows. Now, fifty years later, the island is exactly as it was just after Mitsubishi left. A ghost town in the middle of the sea. From 1974 to 2009, the island was officially closed to all visitors, but recently the intriguing site has been re-opened to organized tours. The site was approved for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage list on July 5, 2015.","The island is only accessible on organised tours. Nagasaki Municipal Government runs trips (ph: +81 095-829-1152), or cruises to the island are available from the Yamasa Kaiun maritime transport company (+81 095-822-5002)."
12,Yoro Park,"Yoro, Japan",Experience park where visitors are told to expect the unexpected.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yoro-park-site-of-reversible-destiny,"The primary attraction of Yoro, a town located in Gifu, Japan, on the eastern side of the Yoro Mountains, Yoro Park is a theme park described as an “experience park,” where visitors are told to expect the unexpected. Also known as the Site of Reversible Destiny, it was conceived by New York-based artists/architects Arakawa and Gins in 1995. Visitors to the park, which sits in a town of only 33,000, are led through the many attractions by a series of guides who know how best to manipulate the surroundings. Attractions include the Critical Resemblance House; the Site of Reversible Destiny; and the Elliptical Field, which resembled a large, bowl-shaped basin. The Critical Resemblance House has a map of Gifu Prefecture as its roof and is filled with sets of furniture arranged in pairs on the floor, the ceiling, and even under the floor. The Elliptical Field is a series of nine pavilions joined by an intricate network of 148 paths. The park also includes golf courses, tennis courts, food courts, and a special area called Kid’s World. Constructed in October 1995, Yoro Park was designed to incorporate the 100 waterfalls in the immediate area, which are another popular draw for visitors. Update December 2019: The park is currently undergoing an extensive renovation to restore some of the attractions. However, temporary pathways have been erected so visitors may still enjoy view and explore every sculpture.","Take the train to Yoro Station, and walk west up The hill. Free shuttle buses are available on high-visitor days."
13,Kochia Hill,"Hitachinaka, Japan","Every autumn, this hillside is ablaze with red summer cypress.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kochia-hill,"The scrubby little kochia plants, otherwise known as summer cypress, are not much to look at for most of the year, but at the end of the wet season they take on an extraordinary brilliant red color, lending them the name “Burning bush.” In Hitachinaka City at the Hitachi Seaside Park, a vast stretch of rolling hills is jam-packed with the vivid crimson bushes that sway with the breeze, with whimsical Oz-like roads winding throughout. Outside of the park, kochia is more often gathered for the more mundane purpose of making brooms, but the park takes advantage of how spectacular it can be when planted in such abundance. The park’s gentle slopes are full of flowering plants year round, often in enormous, monochromatic displays, and is also famous for its blue nemophilas, flowers with transparent blue petals. Overlooking it all is a looming ferris wheel.","To get to the park from Tokyo, take the JR Joban Line super express “Hitachi” to Katsuta Station. From Katsuta Station take the local bus from bus stop #1 and get off at Kaihin-Koen-Nishiguchi. Note, Japan's wet season lasts from the beginning of June to mid-July, so if planning to see the kochi plants in bloom, make sure to plan your trip accordingly."
14,Tōdai-ji Daibutsuden (The Great Buddha Hall),"Nara, Japan","This massive wooden building contains a giant Buddha, healing pillars, and tame deer wandering the grounds.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/t-daiji-daibutsuden-great-buddha-hall,"There are many amazing things about Tōdai-ji and the Daibutsuden or “Great Buddha Hall” in Nara, Japan, such as the gigantic bronze Buddha, which nearly bankrupted Japan in 751, or the fact that this massive Buddha sits in what was once the world’s largest wooden building (surpassed in 1998 by a Japanese stadium). There are also the ancient treasures such as an octagonal lamp from the 700s, but the most surprising sight at the temple is the deer. Known as Sika Deer, they wander through the temples, sleep in corners, and generally stand around as tourists take their pictures. Once considered sacred messengers of the Shinto gods, and protected, they were later hunted to near extinction. Though they have been variously protected and hunted throughout their history in Japan, their population is strong today. Many are tame and established themselves in cities and touristy areas, eating from the hands of delighted visitors. They are even known to come up and bite visitors gently on the buttocks signaling that they desire crackers and they will steal bags from the unwitting. Despite having been damaged and destroyed multiple times due to fire, earthquakes, and accident (the Buddha’s head fell off in 855) both the buildings and the statues have been continually repaired. Today Tōdai-ji, or the Great Eastern Temple complex, and the Great Buddha Hall it contains are in excellent shape. The entryway to the temple is massive, with two towering guardians on each side protecting the great Buddha. The Buddha itself, the world’s largest statue of the Buddha Vairocana (or “Birushana” in Japanese) is seen as the universal aspect of the Buddha, a sort of all-in-one Buddha. The statue weighs some 500 tonnes and is a towering 49 feet tall, with a 17.5 foot-long face. His hair is made of 966 individual bronze balls. Creating this massive bronze Buddha occupied much of Japan’s bronze production during the 700s. Inside the giant temple there are numerous artifacts worth seeing beyond the Great Buddha. As Nara was once the capital of Japan, a lot of history sits in this place. Among the many things to see are miniature replicas of the temple and the grounds, various Buddhist statues, and the (somewhat unfair to the overweight) healing pillars, wooden columns with a hole in the bottom that bring good luck, or you allow you to reach enlightenment in your lifetime and some even say entrance to heaven, if you can squeeze through it.",
15,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,"Kyoto, Japan","The 10,000 Torii shrine.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fushimi-inari-shrine,"Originally established in 711 CE by Korean lords of the area, Fushimi Inari Shrine is the most famous of several thousand shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Foxes are thought to be the messengers of Inari and as such many fox statues can be found at Inari shrines. The foxes are sometimes seen holding keys in their mouths, the key to the rice granaries. Japanese merchants, in particular, worship Inari to bring them wealth and leave numerous offerings at the shrines, particularly fried tofu called abuurage which is believed to be Inari’s favorite food. Fushimi Inari Shrine is also famous for its countless torii gates, offerings by worshippers, that cover the hiking trails of the wooded Mount Inari towering right behind the shrine. These torii gates envelope a path that winds over 2.5 miles up the Inari mountain. You’ll notice that on each torii there is kanji writing. On one side of the torii gates, you’ll see the name of the person or organization that donated it as well as the date that it was donated. The oldest gates there are said to be from the 8th century and new ones are being added frequently. It takes about two hours to walk along the whole trail. Film buffs might recognize this location because parts of the movie Memoirs of a Geisha were shot here. Along the hiking trail, there are several teahouses where you can rest like a pilgrim of bygone days. Once you’re back at the foot of Mount Inari around the entrance, you can also enjoy Kyoto-style Inari sushi—rice wrapped in aburaage—at one of the many establishments that have served food to the shrine-goers for centuries.","The shrine is a three-minute walk from JR Nara Line Inari Station, 10 minutes from Kyoto Station. It is a five-minute walk from Keihan Electric RailwayMain Line Fushimi-Inari station. Recommend arriving early in the morning before the crowds and, if able, taking the winding path all the way to the top of the mountain under the unending maze of torii gates to view hundreds of shrines, foxes, and folded paper cranes."
16,The Firefly Squid of Toyama Bay,"Namerikawa, Japan",Bioluminescent firefly squid light up this Japanese fishing port.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/firefly-squid-toyama-bay,"Watasenia scintillans, or the Firefly Squid, is only 3 inches long, but packs a stunning feature in that small package. At the end of their tentacles are special organs called photophores that light up like glow sticks at a rave. In the Toyama Bay, in the central Japan Sea, the squid are found in fantastic abundance. Normally living at 1200 feet underwater, a v shaped canyon in Toyama bay pushes the current, and the squid, to the surface in massive numbers where, forced up, the millions of squids turn the bay into a writhing, gleaming blue froth. Fished by the ton from March to June, when the fishing boats dump the nets onto the boat floor the squirming squids light up and turn the boats themselves into blue beacons. Thankfully, for the curious visitors, one need not sign up to work on a Japanese fishing-boat tour to see the phenomenon. Sightseeing boats depart from the Namerikawa fishing port around 3am to see the nets 1 to 2 km offshore. It should be noted that Namerikawa is also home to the world’s only museum dedicated to the firefly squid.",
17,Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan,"Hayakawa, Japan","The oldest hotel in the world has been operated by the same family for over 1,300 years, even catering to samurai.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nishiyama-onsen-keiunkan,"Nestled among a number of picturesque hot springs in the mountains, the traditionally-styled Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan in the Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, is recognized as the world’s oldest hotel, inn, and possibly even business in general, catering to everyone from ancient samurai to modern tourists for over a thousand years. Originally established in 705 CE, the traditional “onsen” or “hot spring” was the brainchild of the son of the reigning emperor’s aid. The natural hot springs in the area allowed for the creation of a number of healing baths that drew visitors and military men from all around to come and relax. Among these early patrons were a number of samurai and famed shogun, giving the spa a bit more notoriety still. From its inception, the Keiunkan onsen has been passed down within the original family through the centuries. 52 different generations of descendants have cared for and operated the inn, growing the space and modernizing it slowly with each passing epoch. Today the site is considerably larger than it was over a thousand years ago, but both the look and feel of the inn have remained surprisingly unchanged. Despite modern amenities, the simple, calming design of the spaces and the natural mountains surrounding them make it feel as though it is still 705. Keiunkan currently holds the Guinness World Record for oldest hotel and is now aiming for another, world’s most productive hot spring, thanks to their new bath that pumps over a thousand liters of naturally heated water per minute.",

The lifesize, plastic replica of a robot or “Mobile Suit”, from Gundam, (a hugely popular Japanese animation series), officially opened on July 11, 2009, for the celebration of Gundam’s 30th anniversary. It was closed on August 31, however, such a sight could not remain hidden away for long. After attracting 4.5 million visitors in its first month on display, it popped up again the following year in Shizuoka, where Bandai manufactures its popular Gundam models. It was returned to Tokyo in 2011, displayed in fragments that visitors could pay a small fee to check out or take pictures with, to raise money following the tsunami that had devastated Japan. It is now back in all its glory, outside of a new theme park and museum of all things Gundam, called Gundam Base in the Diver City shopping center. The robot—which shoots smoke and lasers, can move its arms and head, and plays disco music—will be a number one draw on the sightseeing hitlist of visiting otaku, as anime-loving geeks are called here. The Gundam robot is large enough to be visible on the drive from Narita airport to downtown, as cars cross the Tokyo Bay-spanning Rainbow Bridge. The Gundam series itself remains a spectacular commentary on modern warfare, originating from a country that has seen the horrors of dramatic shifts in war technology first hand. The show’s criticisms of warfare seem even more true to life as the Gundam Robot takes its place along the real Tokyo skyline. Update: The original RX-78 Gundam was taken town in March 2017 and replaced in October 2017 with a life-size Unicorn Gundam from the recent series.",Check the website for a schedule of showtimes during the day.
19,The Vine Bridges of Iya Valley,"Miyoshi, Japan","Hanging over one of Japan's ""hidden valleys,"" these vine bridges must be remade every three years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vine-bridges-japan,"One of Japan’s three “hidden” valleys, West Iya Valley is home to the kind of misty gorges, clear rivers, and thatch-roofed houses that one imagines from a Japan of 100 years ago. Remote and difficult to enter, the valley was a favored hideout of refugees, bandits, and disgraced warriors. To get across the Iya river that splits the rough valley terrain, these bandits, warriors, and locals created a very special, if unsteady, type of bridge — a vine bridge. No one is sure exactly who first created the vine bridges that reach across the Iya River (there were at least 13 at one point), although a couple of popular theories exist, both steeped in folklore. One tale says that the bridges were created by spiritual figure Kōbō-Daishi, the founder of Shingon Buddhism. Assumedly he came to the impromptu solution while traveling in the area and the idea caught on well enough to become a tradition. The other school of thought is that the bridges were originally the work of the legendary Heike refugees who would have built the bridges while fleeing from the Genji Clan, in search of a safe place to settle down. The idea was that the bridges could be easily cut down, turning the river valley into a naturally impassible barrier to their enemies. To create the bridges, two Wisteria vines — a particularly aggressive and tough vine that climbs around any host — were grown to extraordinary lengths from either side of the river. Once the vines had reached a sufficient length they were woven together and planking was woven into them at 8 to 12 inches apart. The bridge had no sides and a Japanese historical source relates that the original vine bridge was so unstable, that when those who were not used to it attempted to cross, the bridge would start to sway and bounce wildly causing the poor soul to freeze in place, unable to go any farther. No doubt this suited the reclusive residents of Iya Valley just fine. Local artisans have continued to keep the bridges alive, and while the number of bridges has dwindled to three, they are no less amazing. The largest and most accessible of the spans is the Iya Kazurabashi Bridge which reaches almost 150 feet across the valley at a height of almost 50 feet above the water. This more popular of the vine bridges is in West Iya, quite close to the main village, but the most beautiful vine bridges are a pair found in the east of the valley, known as the husband and wife bridges. Though stories range as to their origins, some believe they were built in the 1100s. While some (though apparently not all) of the bridges have been reinforced with wire and side rails, they are still harrowing to cross. 147 feet long, with planks set seven inches apart and a drop of four and a half stories to the water, they are not for those with a fear of heights. As one bridge crosser put it: “You never think a vine bridge is scary until you walk on one and shit a brick.” About a two-hour drive from Tokushima City, the bridges can still be crossed for 500 yen.",
20,Yokai Street,"Kyoto, Japan",This neighborhood thoroughfare is haunted by dozens of homemade monsters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yokai-street,"Kyoto, Japan’s Ichijo-dori street is a fairly typical neighborhood street save for the dozens of monsters standing sentinel in front of most of the local businesses. Also known as Yokai (“monster”) Street, the tight commercial lane celebrates the often strange beings that populate local folklore. There is a wide range of yokai in Japanese legend ranging from good to mischievous to outright evil. Some are animals, some are human, and some are inanimate objects that have simply come to life. Many of the creatures come from children’s stories or teachable fables parents might tell their children so they would take care of their things and not be wasteful. For instance, treat the broom with respect or, when you break it, it will come alive and haunt you. Ichijo-dori street is home to around 30 of these outlandish creatures that have been created by the owners of the businesses they haunt. Some are fully sculpted statuettes while others are odd hodgepodges of clothing and toys. Despite what it might seem like, the street is not a typical tourist grab. It is populated by small local businesses catering to clientele in the neighborhood. There are no souvenir shops or anything of the sort, simply fun, quirky attempts to bring some attention to the neighborhood and breathe some life into aspects of all but forgotten Japanese folklore.",Standing at the south exit of the shrine on Imadegawa dori you will see a street just east that leads south. Walk south a couple of minutes until you hit a small huddle of shops. Turn west and you will run into these guys.

There are over thousands of maneki-neko cats, from big to small. Locals and tourists alike put new maneki-neko cats every day, so the number is constantly increasing. Legend has it that during the Edo period, the final era of traditional Japanese government, a cat under the care of a priest at Gotokuji Temple led a feudal lord to safety during a thunderstorm. The cat beckoned the lord and his servants inside with a waving gesture—hence all maneki-neko statues have one paw raised. The lord enjoyed tea with the priest while the thunderstorm raged outside. To express his thanks afterward, he donated rice and land and selected Gotokuji Temple as the cemetery for his prestigious family. Today, visitors can see hundreds of lucky cat figures on display around a statue of the goddess of mercy, Kannon. The main building and grounds are dotted with cats, while cat-related art lines the streets surrounding the temple.","Gotokuji is easily accessible from central Tokyo.

He first emerged from his atom bomb disturbed slumber in 1954, and 29 films later—despite his senior status—he’s still “King of the Monsters.” No place knows this better than Godzilla’s hometown of Tokyo, where a giant head of the scaly menace has been seen towering over the Toho Building in the Shinjuku Ward. Toho is the Japanese studio behind the Godzilla franchise, and they added their trademark character to help publicize their Shinjuku movie theater complex. The building also houses Hotel Gracery, a a 970-bed hotel which opened in 2015 and features Godzilla-themed rooms. The head harkens back to the classic Godzilla, instead of the more lateral and lizardly look he took on in the 1998 version. He evokes the beloved and cuddly “guy in a rubber suit” look, with some added light-up eyes and glowing claws. And every few minutes he lets out his signature screechy roar, a little bit car crash, and a little bit nails-on-chalkboard. The Godzilla head is 40 feet tall, which is life-size if you consider that the original monster topped out at 165 feet–about a 16-story building. He can’t quite stomp on his Toho creators downstairs, but he can still give them a good scare.",The Godzilla head is located atop the Toho building Tokyo's Shinjuku ward.

23,Yunessun Spa Resort,"Hakone, Japan","This spa theme park lets its guests take a dip in pools of coffee, wine, or ramen broth.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yunessun-spa-resort,"After centuries of traditional bathhouses and hot springs (known as “onsen”), it’s little wonder that the Yunessun Spa Resort has decided to branch out into more exotic bathing options like green tea baths and ramen pools. Set at the foot of lush green mountains, the spa/theme park in Japan’s Hakone prefecture offers all of the refreshing spa treatments one might expect from such a relaxation palace, but its theme baths are like nothing else in the world. The complex offers a number of theme spas such as the Roman-styled Ancient Roman Bath or the massive God’s Aegean Sea. However its the drink-themed attractions like the Green Tea Spa, where bathers get to relax in a pool filled with actual tea, that steal the show. In addition to the relaxing tea bath, the site also has a Red Wine Spa, a Japanese Sake Spa, a Coffee Spa, and a pepper-water filled Ramen Noodle Spa. More than just colored water, these pools are filled with the actual drink. The coffee is brewed in pots and poured into the pool barrel-by-barrel, and the sake and wine baths could even get someone drunk (although drinking any of these waters is highly inadvisable). Don’t miss the coffee- and wine-pouring ceremonies, which occur several times each day at hours posted near the pools themselves.  Be warned, however, that much like a Nickelodeon gameshow, more juice ends up on the spectators than in the spa. Each themed bath also features over-sized drink containers associated with the bath. For instance, the wine bath issues from a giant wine bottle, and massive fake noodles hang over the ramen pool. Baths can be both relaxing and fun but Yunessun has finally created baths that can make people hungry.",

The story of the 47 Ronin (historically known as “The Ako Incident,” and known in fiction as the “Chushingura”) is held as an exemplar of the Bushido honor code associated not just with historic samurai, but which is also part of the national identity. The story tells of Asano Naganori, a feudal lord in 18th century Japan, who was forced to commit ritual suicide (seppuku) after he attacked Kira Yoshinaka, a high-ranking master of ceremonies. Naganori’s death left the samurai under his auspice without a master, and 47 of them felt honor-bound to take revenge. Newly ronin-ized, the 47 warriors disappeared into lives of drunkenness and vice for over a year, although according to the legend, this was all part of the plan. In December of 1703, the 47 Ronin pulled themselves out of their seeming stupor, and launched a surprise attack on Yoshinaka’s castle. They successfully killed Yoshinaka, avenging their master. However true to their code they then turned themselves into the authorities, who then asked each of them to commit seppuku. The 47 Ronin took their own lives, upholding the sacred Bushido code. Based on actual events, the story has become so ingrained as a national legend that exact fact and fiction are not immediately easy to separate. Nonetheless, Naganori and his 47 Loyal Retainers, or the men the legend is based on, are buried at the 17th century Buddhist temple, Sengaku-Ji. The temple is still a popular destination for visitors looking to pay tribute to real-life legends.","About 3 minutes from Sengakuji Station, but also within a walking distance from Shinagawa, which should take more or less 15 minutes."

Stairs lead down into the 70-foot-deep cavern and areas where you must crouch to get through. Once you reach the bottom, the ice is crystal clear and stunning, catching the color-changing light beautifully. Narusawa Hyoketsu formed as a result of a massive eruption of Mount Fuji in the year 864. Lava flowed through a channel beneath the hardened surface, leaving behind this 156-meter (512-foot) underground tunnel. The average temperature of the cave is around zero degrees Celsius. As water drips through the rock, it freezes into long, spindly icicles as well as larger pillars of ice, some of which stand around 30 meters (100 feet) tall. The ice is there year-round, though it is larger in the winter, when icicles can reach up to three feet long.  Located on the edge of the Aokigahara, also known as the “Sea of Trees,” Narusawa Hyoketsu is designated a Natural Monument of Japan.","Very easy to reach using the ""sightseeing buses"".

This area, known as Omoide Yokocho (“Memory Lane”), started out as a black market in the late 1940s after World War II. The strip was also known for cheap drinks and grilled skewers of yakitori. The area’s many watering holes and lack of public restrooms earned it the nickname “piss alley,” as inebriated patrons would relieve themselves in the street. Although the alley was partly razed to make room for the new Shinjuku station and partly destroyed in a fire in the 1990s, a sizable chunk has survived. The local government also rebuilt the fire-damaged sections, making sure to restore their original Shōwa-era appearance.

After the disaster locals began reconstruction with a shrine to a fire protection deity, Akiba. As Tokyo expanded the neighborhood developed, and took the name of the shrine that protected it. Following World War II, as Japan became more future-focused, Akihabara became known as the place to buy electronic goods of all kinds: radios, television sets, household appliances, many of them sold illegally. Tokyoites knew to head to “Akihabara Electric Town” for all the latest contraptions on the market. Naturally, when home computers entered the global marketplace, Akihabara was the place to buy them. In the 1980s, paso-kons, personal computers, were a niche hobby. The evolution of the internet over the decades to come meant that otakus (the obsessive fans that have unified into a proud subculture) could create and share at an ever-increasing rate. The neighborhood’s wares changed to suit this cultural explosion. Though Akihabara is still the place to go for computers, cell phones, cameras, video games, and other electronic goods, the visual landscape has been dominated by anime and manga aesthetic. In recent years Akihabara Electric Town has only become more of a consumer’s paradise. On Sundays the central Chuo-dori street is blocked off to vehicles.

While Ryoan-ji (The Temple of the Dragon at Peace) is actually the name of the entire temple complex which surrounds the almost 3,000 square foot rock garden, or kare-sansui in Japanese, the name is now synonymous with the serene stone scene. Constructed around the year 1500 either by professional gardeners or monks, the meditative scene contains 15 small boulders resting in a bed of white gravel which is raked into perfect lines each day by the current monks in the temple. It is said that the garden is setup so that visitors can only see 14 of the boulders at one time, but upon enlightenment, they will be able to see fifteen. The garden is surrounded by a wall made of clay boiled in oil that has taken on a rich, woody color from its years at the temple. There are no plants in the garden save for the moss that grows on the stationary boulders. While the large boulders in the garden appear to have been placed at random, scholars both philosophical and scientific have attempted to divine the meeting of the space. While some say that the rocks are placed in such a way as to draw attention to the architectural flourishes of the building, or that their placement hides some underlying message, most guests agree that so long as you can find personal meaning in the quiet natural order of the garden, you have found the meaning of Ryoan-ji.",
37,Blue Pond,"Hokkaidō, Japan",This mesmerizingly colorful pond looks like a scene straight out of a fairytale.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-pond,"A quick walk through the forest near Biei, Japan, leads to a mesmerizing scene straight out of a fairytale. There, a brilliant blue pond lies tucked away within the woods. Dead silver birch trees poke above the water’s edge, their reflections seemingly painted on a glassy canvas. The artificial pond was created in 1988 when the Biei River was dammed to prevent damage from mudflows from the eruption of nearby Mount Tokachi. What was supposed to be just an effect of an environmental engineering project created a breathtakingly beautiful human-made wonder. The pond’s cerulean hue is thought to be caused by aluminum hydroxide suspended in the water. Aluminium hydroxide reflects shorter-wavelength blue light, meaning that the water itself isn’t actually blue. But that doesn’t make it any less captivating. The enchanting color changes depending on the angle from which you view it, the time of day, and the season. When the air is still, it reflects the trees submerged within their watery grave like a blue-tinted mirror. Though the pond freezes over during the colder months, there’s now an annual tradition of illuminating the water each season, creating an ethereal glow beneath the blanket of snow and ice. If the pond looks at all familiar, there’s a good reason why. It gained international recognition after Apple included an image of it as a wallpaper in OS X Mountain Lion, which was released in 2012.","The pond is accessible by vehicle or by bus tour from Sapporo. From the parking lot, it is a five-to-10-minute walk through the forest to the pond. Access to the pond is always open and there is no charge to visit."
38,Kokoen Garden,"Himeji, Japan",Nine Gardens in one—with tea service.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kokoen-garden,"The Kokoen garden, sometimes called Himeji Kokoen, is just a five minute walk from Himeji Castle in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. If, for example, you arrive too late to tour the castle and everyone in your group is cranky, Kokoen Garden is a fine option. Built in 1992 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Himeji municipality, the gardens are set at the location of several samurai houses – a fact established through seven archeological excavations. Set on just under nine acres, the gardens were designed in the style of the Edo Period, the period of Japanese History from 1603-1868, when shoguns ruled Japan (also known as the Tokugawa shogunate). Professor Makoto Nakamura of Kyoto University designed the gardens so that, which each turn down one of the many paths, the view changes and it appears one has entered another garden entirely. As such, the gardens are themed – the garden of the lord’s residence, complete with requisite bridges, waterfall and koi pond, a tea garden, where a formal tea ceremony can be enjoyed for an additional fee, a pine tree garden, a bamboo garden, a flower garden, etc. While the gardens are beautiful in any season, if you can arrange your schedule with a bit of spontaneity, go to Japan during cherry blossom season (any time from March to May, depending). It’s hard to predict, but an entire nation celebrating new life in the form of perfectly delicate flowers on previously barren trees is a once in a lifetime experience not to be missed.","To gain access to this garden, you may add an extra fee to the Himeji Castle ticket or buy a separate ticket only for it."
39,Zauo,"Tokyo, Japan",The freshest fish here are the ones you catch yourself.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zauo,"“Zauo” is an amalgamation of the kanji for “Sit” and “Fish”, which is basically the entire concept of this themed restaurant chain in Japan. Unlike those in most seafood restaurants, the aquariums in Zauo are not just for show. When you enter Zauo, you’re given a fishing rod and some bait, and are told to catch your own dinner. You sit on a giant boat, surrounded by an equally impressive aquarium full of fish. The aquarium is full of a variety of pescaterian delights ranging from red snapper, to mackerel, to sharks. If it’s in the aquarium, it’s fair game for you to catch. Whether or not you can catch the more delectable fish depends more on luck than skill. When you eat depends on how well you fish, and how you want your fish prepared. You can get your fish grilled, fried, steamed, and boiled, but the freshest option is to have your fish raw, sashimi style.",
40,Sōgenji Temple (Kappa-Dera),"Tokyo, Japan","Shrine to Japanese water-goblins, complete with their preserved body parts.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sougenji-kappa-dera-temple,"In Japanese folklore, the kappa is a bipedal, turtle-like aquatic goblins who sometimes grabs unsuspecting humans, often children, as they walk over bridges or through swamps, pulling them down into the muck to drown them. The fishy-smelling kappa’s most distinct feature is the bowl-like dent on the top of its head, which it must keep filled with water at all times to stay alive. There is also a curious myth about a fictitious, mysterious organ called shirikodama (“anus ball”), for which the creature reportedly kills its victims for. The Tokyo neighborhood of Kappabashi adopts the kappa as its mascot, even though the “kappa” in its name simply comes from a homophonous word meaning “raincoat,” deriving from Portuguese capa. In this case, it comes from the name of a local merchant, Kappaya (“raincoat-seller”) Kihachi, who funded the construction of a canal to prevent flood damages. During the canal’s construction, it is said that the kappa came from the nearby Sumida River and helped Kihachi. When he died in 1814 he was buried at Sōgen-ji, a 17th-century temple that eventually became known as the Kappa-dera (“kappa temple”). Today, the temple still stands there and its altar is kept piled high with offerings of cucumbers - said to be the kappa’s favorite food - and its treasure chamber contains antique scroll-drawings of the goblins and even the mummified arm of a kappa. Visitors should keep an eye out for the numerous statues of kappa that stand outside local shops in the area. Some of these are cute and cuddly, but others are decidedly creepy. If you ever encounter a real kappa, remember that some kappa are good-natured, like the others who helped Kihachi, and some are mischievous and harmless, though there are murderous ones, too. The kappa often challenges children to a sumo match, and even though it’s incredibly strong (and will eat your internal organs if you lose), there is a chance to win: bow to it as the match begins, and it will oblige the creature to bow in return, emptying its head-bowl and losing its strength.","The kappa temple is just west of the Asakusa district, and a five-minute taxi-ride, or 15-minute walk, from Ueno JR station on the Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines. It is also a 10-minute walk from the Iriya (Hibiya line) and Inaricho (Ginza line) Tokyo Metro stations, and a 7-minute walk from the Asakusa station of the Tsukuba Express line."
41,Hachiko,"Tokyo, Japan","After a profound show of devotion for his master, a dog becomes the symbol of loyalty for an entire nation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hachiko-hachi-shibuya-station,"If there was one thing that Professor Ueno could count on, it was the sight of his loyal companion patiently waiting for him as he stepped off the train every evening after his commute. Every day for a year, the golden Akita, dubbed Hachikō, would accompany his owner to Shibuya Station, and every day he would be waiting for the professor to return for the walk home. One sad day, the train came, but Professor Ueno didn’t appear. Hachikō returned the next day, and the next, but there was no way to tell the poor dog what had become of his master. The Professor had died of a stroke and would never step off of the train to greet him again. For nine years, Hachikō waited for the train every day, only to leave alone. Commuters and station employees would feed him treats and keep him company, and an old student of the professor retraced the dog’s genealogy, declaring Hachikō as one of only 30 purebred Akitas remaining in the world. He became quite the celebrity over the years, inspiring books, films, art, and poetry, and was present at the unveiling of his own bronze statue, a version of which still remains at Shibuya Station as a popular meeting spot. When Hachikō died of a combination of cancer and worms in the streets of Shibuya in 1935, his remains were stuffed and mounted, and can now be visited at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo. Flanking taxidermized Hachikō are Jirō, one of two Sakhalin Huskies famous for surviving a year in Antarctica after being abandoned during a failed scientific expedition to the South Pole, and Kai Ken (a.k.a. “Tora Inu” or “Tiger Dog”), a rare breed of dog considered to be the most ancient and purest dog breed in Japan. Hachikō is placed low in the display case representing his true height. This placement invites the viewer to kneel just as you would to pet a live dog. It also places him eye to eye with the children who gleefully rush toward him shouting, “Hachikō! Hachikō!” when they spy him from around the corner. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Hachikō.",There is now a virtual Hachiko at the Tokyo Plaza that allows you to take the famed dog for a virtual walk.
42,Tenryu-Ji Shrine's Bamboo Trail,"Kyoto, Japan",A beautiful bamboo trail tucked in this famous Japanese Shrine.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tenryu-ji-shrine,"Heavenly Dragon Temple, or Tenryu-ji, is best known for its zen garden, a long and winding path lined with thousands of towering bamboo stalks. Tenryū-ji — more formally known as Tenryū Shiseizen-ji — is the head temple of the Tenryū branch of Rinzai Zen Buddhism. Founded by Ashikaga Takauji in 1339 and originally headed by Musō Soseki, the temple was built primarily to venerate Gautama Buddha. While the rest of the temple was rebuilt after burning down, the zen garden has survived, uninterrupted, since its planting. As a temple related to both the Ashikaga family and Emperor Go-Daigo, the temple is held in high esteem, and is ranked number one among Kyoto’s so-called Five Mountains, or Kyoto Gozan. In 1994, it was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the “Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto”. The bamboo trail can be accessed via the North Gate.","You can arrive at Tenryu-ji by city bus or by JR train from Kyoto station to Saga Arashiyama station (嵯峨嵐山駅). take the south exit and walk down the street for about 200 meters (220 yards), then make a right turn just before you get to the train tracks (different line). You will walk straight into Tenryu-ji after 350 meters (380 yards). Despite its supposed name, the bamboo trail is located outside the grounds of Tenryu-ji Temple. It’s also known as the Sagano Bamboo Forest."
43,Ryūsendō Cave,"Iwaizumi, Japan",A massive cave complex boasts some of the clearest water (and most charming bats) in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ryusendo-cave,"One of the three largest limestone caverns in Japan, Ryūsendō Cave features expansive subterranean galleries arching over deep sunless lakes filled with breathtakingly clear blue water. The complex has been designated as a natural monument by the Japanese government since 1934, thanks not only to its remarkable size and enchanting aquatic features, but also because of the unique varieties of bats that call the cave home. Surveys of Ryūsendō Cave began in 1920, and thus far, some 3600m (about 2 miles) have been explored and mapped, of which 700m (a half mile) can be visited by the public. Exploration is ongoing, however, and it is believed that the full extent of the cave is likely 5000m (3 miles) or more. Additionally, eight underground lakes have been found in Ryūsendō, fed by underground river of crystal-clear spring water constantly gushing forth from the bedrock. Three of these lakes are accessible to visitors and feature submerged lighting that illuminates that chambers with the brilliant blues and greens of the limestone-filtered waters—colors pleasingly saturated thanks to the clarity and depth of the waters. A fourth lake that is not included in the tour reaches an impressive depth of 120m (almost 400 feet), making it the deepest underground lake in Japan as well as one of the most transparent lakes in the world. Elevated walkways, bridges, and stairs conduct visitors through a 30-minute tour that ranges from the water’s surface to the cavern roof, where those intrepid enough can view the watery depths from amidst stalactites high above. While up there, one might even come face-to-face with some of the rare bats that populate the cave, including Brown long-eared bats, Eastern long-fingered bats, Hilgendorf’s tube-nosed bats, and Greater horseshoe bats.","Ryusendo Cave is open seven days a week, and admission is ¥1,000 for adults and ¥500 for students."
44,Ninja Akasaka,"Tokyo, Japan","A restaurant modeled after feudal Japan, where the waitstaff are trained as ninjas.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ninja-akasaka,"Entering through a plain black facade, the restaurant inside is only marked by a small sign reading “NINJA” in English. A silent escort dressed head to toe in black will lead you through a series of winding corridors, a drawbridge, and secret doorways into the hidden dining room. This is Ninja Akasaka, where diners can step four centuries into the past as black-clad mercenaries serve up dinner and a show. The atmosphere is decked out in stone and wood, Edo period style, when Japan operated under a feudal system and ninjas were spy warriors available for hire. Though there is little historical evidence to flesh out our knowledge of ninjas, they have become a folklore fascination the world over, so needless to say Ninja Akasaka does well. Patrons order their food off of lengthy scrolls, after which the ninja waitstaff fade into the darkness. They’re not gone for long though—they will periodically reappear, seemingly out of thin air, to entertain the table with sword tricks and martial arts demonstrations. The food is modern Japanese cuisine, but each course is served with dramatic ninja flair. Black sesame crackers are shaped like throwing stars. Escargot “bombs” are lit on fire by a fuse of gunpowder. Snow crab is served atop a grapefruit pierced by a sword, which, when removed, releases smoky vapor from the dry ice inside.",
45,Monet's Pond,"Seki-shi, Japan",This pond is so stunning it looks like you've stepped into one of Monet's masterpieces.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monets-pond,"Claude Monet’s softly colorful Water Lilies paintings are some of the most beautiful and famous of the Impressionist era. If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to see those lovely tranquil scenes through Monet’s eyes, this small pond in Japan’s Gifu Prefecture is about as close as you can get. The coloration of the aptly nicknamed Monet’s Pond is so profound you’d think there must be some artificial lighting or dye at play. The neon-looking plants are insanely vibrant, the water is crystal clear and shimmering, and the water lilies and bright koi contrast spectacularly with the dark pond beneath them. But amazingly, there are no visual effects whatsoever. Monet’s Pond is naturally just that beautiful. Located in Seki city, the small body of water, just 60 feet long, remarkably resembles the pond in the French painter’s famous Water Lilies series, which actually depicts the Japanese garden at his home in Giverny, France. The pond can be found via a short path that circles the pond. If you’re looking for a bit more of a hike, you can climb a little farther to Nemichi Shrine, a Shinto place of worship.",
46,Sokushinbutsu of Dainichibou Temple,"Tsuruoka, Japan",The self-mummified monks of Japan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sokushinbutsu-dainichi-temple,"Scattered throughout northern Japan are over two dozen mummified Japanese monks known as sokushinbutsu. Followers of shugendō, an ancient form of Buddhism, the monks died in the ultimate act of self-denial. For three years, the priests would eat a special diet consisting only of nuts and seeds, while taking part in a regimen of rigorous physical activity that stripped them of their body fat. They then ate only bark and roots for another three years and began drinking a poisonous tea made from the sap of the urushi tree, normally used to lacquer bowls. This caused vomiting and a rapid loss of bodily fluids, and—most importantly—it killed off any maggots that might cause the body to decay after death. Finally, a self-mummifying monk would lock himself in a stone tomb barely larger than his body, wherein he would not move from the lotus position. His only connection to the outside world was an air tube and a bell. Each day, he rang a bell to let those outside know that he was still alive. When the bell stopped ringing, the tube was removed and the tomb sealed. Not all monks who attempted self-mummification were successful. When the tombs were finally opened, some bodies were found to have rotted. These monks were resealed in their tombs. They were respected for their endurance, but they were not worshiped. Those monks who had succeeded in mummifying themselves were raised to the status of Buddha, put on display, and tended to by their followers. The Japanese government outlawed sokushinbutsu in the late 19th century, though the practice apparently continued into the 20th. Although roughly 28 of these sokushinbutsu remain, only 16 of them can be visited. The most famous is Shinnyokai Shonin of the Dainichibou Temple on the holy Mount Yudono. The majority of the monks who underwent self-mummification did so near this temple. It has been shown that a local spring had high levels of arsenic, and this may have helped the monks in the mummification process. Others can be found in more banal locations such as in Nangakuji Temple, in the suburbs of Tsuruoka, and at Kaikokuji Temple in the small city of Sakata.",

Hidden on the fifth floor of an unassuming office building in the middle of a busy Shinjuku Sanchome street, this small bar is packed with various games and gaming accessories from Mario figurines to Power Gloves to Nintendo’s 3-D gaming system and even Virtual Boy. So-called in reference to consoles’ 8-bit processors, the 8-bit era of gaming began in 1983 with the release of Famicom (short for “Family Computer”) in Japan. In other parts of the world, this pivotal gaming system would be known by another name: the Nintendo Entertainment System. Shortly thereafter, games such as Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, and The Legend of Zelda became household names around the world. It’s no surprise that Japan, a powerhouse of the video game industry, especially during the early ’80s, would have establishments celebrating this history. In fact, the country as a whole and Tokyo in particular have a plethora of video game–themed establishments, but not many quite like the 8bit Cafe. Not only can you peruse various memorabilia, you can also pick any of the games from the shelves and play them while sipping on a drink themed after your favorite video game character.","Take the C5 exit from the Shinjuku Sanchome station, the bar is on the fifth floor of the building to your right. Open from 6pm to midnight on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. From 6 pm to 5 am on Fridays and from 6 pm to 1:30 am on Saturdays. Closed on Tuesdays.
