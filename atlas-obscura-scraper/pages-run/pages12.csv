0,Ta Prohm,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",A battle between nature and architecture in the Cambodian jungle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ta-prohm,"Had Ta Prohm been diligently maintained from its construction in 1186 to the present day, it would be just a footnote to the larger Angkor Wat temple. But while Ta Prohm lay forgotten and neglected by men, the Cambodian jungle wasted no time in devouring it. Silk-cotton and strangler fig trees took root in the loosened stones of the temple, which was built entirely without mortar. Their roots wound through the structure, creating an astonishing merger of nature and architecture. Built at the height of the Khmer Empire by Jayavarman VII as a Buddhist monastery and center of learning, Ta Prohm (known as Rajavihara back then) has a traditional Khmer structure consisting of a series of gradually smaller enclosures, the largest of which is about 1000 by 650 meters. The sanctuary is centered around the huge, elevated stone face of Prajnaparamita, the personification of wisdom, whose features were modeled after those of the king’s mother. When Angkor was rediscovered in the early 20th century by French archaeologists, all of the temples had become overgrown–but none so spectacularly as Ta Prohm. Nevertheless, as they excavated and restored the other temples, the archaeologists had to make sure that the giant tree roots enveloping Ta Prohm would not further deteriorate the structure or make it dangerous to visit. Though Ta Prohm may look like nature unfettered, the appearance of neglect is in fact fastidiously maintained. Ta Prohm’s popularity has soared in recent years along with the rest of the Angkor complex, but especially because of its appearance in the movie Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. Be sure to check out the controversial Dinosaur of Ta Prohm–a corner of the Ta Prohm temple with a strange story of its own. Another contributor to the rising popularity of Ta Prohm was the inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1992.",Flights into Siem Reap Airport are a short jump from Phnom Penh or Bangkok. The best months to visit the temple complex with smaller crowds is the wet season from May to October.
1,Bokor Hill Station,"Kampot Province, Cambodia",A former French military respite turned jungle tourism hotspot.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bokor-hill-station,"One of the first things anyone notices during a visit to Cambodia, is the unbearable heat. Sweltering and oppressive temperatures and humidity beat down on travelers wading through the dense tropical jungles of the Southern region. Incidentally, when a larger and more aggressive group of travelers, the French military, made their way through the country, they also found the weather brutal and unforgiving. As the unfamiliar temperatures began killing off French troops, the occupying European power needed to create artificial respite. Their answer to the tropical problem was Bokor Hill Station, a small resort town for French soldiers in the region. Construction finished in the early 1920s, and the result was jungle chic. Instead of building a small outpost to keep soldiers cool and dry, the French opted for opulence, and a small elegant city was born. Bokor Hill was built with the basic amenities of a post office and church. It was also featured the over-the-top Bokor Hill Hotel and Casino, which stands as a monument to French occupation in Cambodia. When civil war broke out in the 1940s, the French headed back to Paris, leaving the station abandoned and open for use by various military regimes including the Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge. Continuous war throughout the 20th century left the station gutted and eerily decaying in the center of Phnum Bokor National Park. Only one completely ruined road leading to the relic still exists, and is a bumpy ride up more than 3,500 feet to the station. Recently, a private investment group has outlined a plan to rebuild the road and restore the area, creating a larger Bokor Hill city complete with a casino and golf course, making Bokor once again a stop for invading foreigners in the southern jungles of Cambodia. The project is now well under way, as can be seen in some of the photos. The red lichen on the walls has been covered with a layer of thin concrete making the building look newer, even at the cost of the old charm. The casino has been built, though the locals consider it an eyesore. Behind the temple is Wat Sampov Pram, Temple of the Five Ships, where rock formations look a great deal like sailing ships when the fog the normally enshrouds the mountain is clear enough to let you see them and the spectacular view of the valley below. Farther down the road, but still on the mountaintop, is Popkvil, Waterfall in the Clouds. it is a popular destination and worth the short ride from the old casino. Between the two, along a back road, is an area called 500 rice fields; a natural area that looks a lot like the Cambodian countryside in miniature. Across the street and through the guard station is an area teaming with rare carnivorous plants; nepenthes or pitcher plants. This area is perfect for their growth and hundreds can be found along the road. They have garnered a lot of attention in recent years because the young plants can look a great deal like something you might buy in an adult toy store.  Some of these plants can be found in the 500 fields area, but if you are a photographer, it is worth it to pay the few bucks to get into the area where the bigger plants can be found. Update December 2018: The reconstruction is complete and it is no longer derelict.",Around 40 km driving from Kampot.
2,Kbal Spean,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",This Cambodian riverbed is covered in ancient Hindu carvings both above and below the waters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kbal-spean,"Tucked away in the jungles of Angkor, Cambodia is a small river that runs over a series of elaborate carvings that have been etched both along the shore line and into the very stone of the riverbed itself. Created some time around the 11th and 12th century, the carvings at in the Kbal Spean River look like something right out of an Indiana Jones production diary. The designs range from fields of low circles that almost look like holy cobble stones to ornate images of Hindu deities carved in relief on the rocks. Not all of the carvings seem to have originated in the same era, having been added to down the millennia, but today, they all look like they are of a piece. The site is also known as the “Valley of a 1000 Lingas.” This common name is in reference to the low carved circles that were once mound-shaped representations of the Hindu god Shiva, called “lingas.” In contrast there are also a number (though not so many) of designs symbolizing the yoni, a symbol for the Hindu goddess Shakti. The site looks not unlike something that would have come out of a Hollywood storyboard, all fearsome gods and cryptic symbols, barely hidden beneath the jungle undergrowth. Whether you are visiting for a sense of adventure, archaeology, or simple history, the Kbal Spean carvings won’t let you down.",31 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Siem Reap. From the parking lot it's a beautiful mile walk in to the stretch with the carvings.
3,Dinosaur of Ta Prohm,"Siem Reap, Cambodia","Hoax, mistake, or evidence of dinosaurs in human times?",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dinosaur-angkor-wat,"Hordes of tourists descend on Cambodia every year for the sole purpose of visiting the temples at Angkor. This magnificent series of temples, carved out of the jungle in the 12th and 13th centuries by Khmer devaraja, or god-kings, is still the largest group of religious complexes ever created. Yet most visitors miss one of its more intriguing mysteries. At Ta Prohm, near Angkor Wat and built by the epic builder king Jayavarman VII in the late 1100s, a small carving on a crumbling temple wall seems to show a dinosaur - a stegosaurus, to be exact. The hand-sized carving can be found in a quiet corner of the complex, a stone temple engulfed in jungle vegetation where the roots of centuries-old banyan trees snake through broken walls. After parts of Tomb Raider were shot here, the temple got a PR lift and has become one of the site’s top tourist draws. But many of the package tours are still ushered in and out without spotting the enigmatic dinosaur carving. Several different theories have been advanced to explain its presence. Some maintain it’s a recently-carved hoax, while others say that the ancient Khmers could have unearthed a fossil and figured out what kind of creature it belonged to. One theory has it that the image actually shows a cow or rhino with a palm tree in the background - the palm’s fronds being easily mistaken for the fin-like blades running down a stegosaurus’s back. Or maybe the carving is evidence that dinosaurs really did live on until much later than previously thought. (Creationists would certainly like to believe so.) Perhaps here in the humid, ancient jungles of Southeast Asia, where the climate has remained largely unchanged since the dinosaurs’ days, giant reptiles lived on well into the human era - long enough to persist in the Khmer folk memory. If only these walls could talk, we might have a clue.",The carving is located in a corner of a courtyard in the Ta Prohm temple. Look to the left of the central exit.
4,Sambor Prei Kuk,"Prasat Sambour, Cambodia",More than 100 Hindu temples are slowly being swallowed by the forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sambor-prei-kuk,"Gnarled trees wrap around the ruins that speckle this archaeological site. The centuries-old temples, many of which are capped with grass or shrouded with tree roots, are slowly being reclaimed by the forest. Sambor Prei Kuk consists of a fortified wall enclosing 150 Hindu buildings. An engraving on the main temple of this complex refers to King Isanavarman I, and it is accompanied by a date: September 13, 627. Whether or not this is the exact date when the construction of the temple was completed, it still means that Sambor Prei Kuk predates Angkor Wat by several centuries. Sambor Prei Kuk was the capital of the Chenla Empire (600 to 800). The label of “empire” should be qualified, as it stems from accounts by Chinese emissaries, but it probably referred to a cluster of semi-independent chiefdoms co-existing in a peaceful federation. The site is divided into three groups. Group N (North) and S (South) are both from the seventh century and glorify Shiva. Prasat Sambor (the main temple) belongs to Group N. Group C (Central) consists of more recent temples from the ninth century, including Prasat Boram, a temple famed for its lion sculptures. There are some obvious architectural similarities between Sambor Prei Kuk and the temple found on Angkor Wat grounds. The outstanding lintels, pediments, and columns of Sambor Prei Kuk are precursors of the Angkor style. There are, however, some aspects that are distinctive to Sambor Prei Kuk, such as the 10n octagonal towers, which are unique in Southeast Asia. Of the 150 religious buildings, most are in ruins and barely recognizable, but it is a thrill to wander in the forest and trying to locate some of these buildings, which, at times, blend in seamlessly with the vegetation. As in other archaeological sites in Cambodia, the intrinsic value of these temples is only part of their attractiveness. The other part is the interplay of human-made structures and nature that stands simultaneously as a reminder of the reliance of these ancient buildings and the sobering thought that in the long run, nature will always have the upper hand. But though the archaeological site now feels like a tranquil forest escape, it hasn’t always been the peaceful spot it is today. In the 1970s, a contingent of the Khmer Rouge took refuge on the grounds of Sambor Prei Kuk, and, as a result, the United States bombed the site, damaging some temples. You can still see some of the dips in the ground that the bombs created. To make things worse, it seems that the Khmer Rouge also littered the grounds with mines, which weren’t removed until 2008.","Sambor Prei Kuk is an archaeological site about 19 miles (30 kilometers) west of provincial capital Kompong Thom. The site is open daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Caution should be exercised—though these grounds were cleared of all landmines in 2008, it's hard to know with absolute certainty that no mines have been left behind."
5,Phnom Penh Memorial Stupa,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia","5,000 skulls in memorial to those killed by the Khmer Rouge.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phnom-penh-memorial-stupa,"After the Cambodian Civil War ended, the vicious rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge began. From 1975-1979, they killed 1.7 million people out of a population of 8 million. Many of those murdered were buried in mass graves in what has come to be dubbed the “killing fields.” In Phnom Penh at Choeung Ek, a memorial was erected to remember those who were killed at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. At the site, the remains of an estimated 10,000 people were found. The memorial was then constructed so as not to obscure the facts, but to show the grisly and honest truth. Designed in the style of a Buddhist stupa, the Choeung Ek memorial has glass sides, and is comprised of multiple layers of human skulls. Totaling 5,000 of those executed at the site, the skulls are a harsh reminder of a genocide that took place only 40 years ago. The memorial is particularly disturbing upon closer examination of the skulls, many of which bear marks of the trauma they suffered before their execution. Along with the stupa, Choeung Ek still has a number of pits that were used as mass graves, and some human bones can still be seen in the area. The Cambodian government encourages visitors to see the site, and never forget the atrocities committed during the Khmer Rouge regime.

6,Preah Vihear Temple,"Kantuot, Cambodia",This impressive clifftop temple was once at the center of an international custody dispute.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/preah-vihear-temple,"Sitting majestically atop a perilous cliff among the Dângrêk Mountains, the Preah Vihear Temple is a gem of Cambodian temple architecture, although for a long time, many fought for this jewel to belong in Thailand’s crown. A temple has existed on the site since the 9th century, but the elaborately detailed complex found here today dates back to around the 11th century. It was built by the Suryavarman kings who were replicating the glorious intent of the nearby temples at Angkor. While the temple buildings at Preah Vihear are not as glorious as those at Angkor, they were meant to represent the same holy pinnacle. The whole complex is set up in a long horizontal line along the edge of the cliff, comprised of multiple structures, each impressive in their own right. As the Dângrêk Mountains have borders belonging to both Cambodia and Thailand, the site’s ownership became an issue between the two countries when the temple was rediscovered in the early 20th century. Both sides wanted to own the ancient site and its rich trove of artifacts, and the dispute even went to The Hague. In 1962, the matter was finally settled when the international court decided that the temple belonged to Cambodia, a ruling that stands today.","Although open from the Cambodian side, the Thailand side is often blocked."
7,Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau,"Krong Battambang, Cambodia","Limestone caves in the Cambodian countryside, once the site of genocide, now a place of peaceful beauty.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/killing-caves-of-phnom-sampeau,"The Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau (also known as Phnom Sampov) are a place of beauty, turned tragedy, turned beauty once more. The cave are located halfway up a mountain which is dotted with beautiful wats, statues, and lookout points over the village below. Macaque monkeys roam the mountainside, and millions of bats can be seen at dusk. Stairways snake up the mountain and back down again into limestone caves and canyons. One of these caves is the Killing Cave. From 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million Cambodians were killed at the hands of Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge soldiers. These are the bones of doctors, teachers, men, women and children who were killed by the Khmer Rouge at this site. At the top of the cave is the natural skylight which the Khmer Rouge marched people to, lining them up, then bludgeoning them and letting their bodies fall into the darkness below. The site has now been turned into a memorial to those who lost their lives at this site. The descent into the cave is quite beautiful—the rock is covered in green vegetation and low-hanging vines. The cave is quite large inside, and a huge golden Buddha reclines in the center of the room. But at the bottom of the stairway sits a chicken-wire cage full of bones. The atrocities that took place in this beautiful spot suddenly become very present. To the right is another memorial of human remains, these encased in a glass box. Today a mix of mostly Cambodian tourists mills around the cave, and people sing and take pictures. It is a surprisingly jovial atmosphere considering the horror of what took place. But as many Cambodians will explain to you, joy is the best way to move past tragedy.",A hill 7 miles (11 km) southwest of Battambang
8,Phsar Thmei (Central Market),"Phnom Penh, Cambodia","One of the biggest markets in Asia, under one of the continent's largest domes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phsar-thmei-central-market,"Phsar Thmei, also known as Central Market (the name actually means “New Market”), is the largest market in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, and was once said to be the most expansive in all of Asia. It also has the distinction of sitting under one of the largest domes on the continent. Before the completion of Phsar Thmei in 1937, the area on which the market now stands was occupied by a swamp fed by runoff water during the rainy season. For the French Protectorate of Cambodia, who was in charge of Phnom Penh at the time, having a swamp in the middle of their city was far from ideal. So they drained it and set about building a huge market, designed by Jean Desbois and supervised by French architect Louis Chauchon. At the time of its construction, Phsar Thmei was said to be the largest market in Asia. But despite its grandeur, it nonetheless had a troubled start. Flooding was a problem, perhaps unsurprisingly given its location in a favored gathering point for runoff water. Then came the Franco-Thai war (1940–1941), during which the market was bombed by Thai aircraft, causing extensive damage. It was closed temporarily and rebuilt after the end of World War II. It later fell into an undeniably shabby state, until the French Development Agency completed a $4.2 million renovation in 2011. It remains one of the largest domes in Asia, measuring 148 feet (45 meters) in diameter and 85 feet (26 meters) high. To say that the market is somewhat incongruous with the rest of central Phnom Penh would be an understatement. With its huge yellow dome and four extending “legs,” it looks—from the air at least—as if a Barbarella-esque Art Deco space robot planted itself in the middle of the city. Walk inside, however, and you’ll find yourself in a vast, cool, and always buzzing market under the towering central dome, with more stalls spreading along the four adjoining wings. Despite the often inflated prices, especially for visiting tourists, Phsar Thmei is the best place in the city for browsing. It’s packed full of all kinds of goods, from impressively intricate gold and silverware to souvenirs, antique coins, electronic goods, clothing (imported and traditional Cambodian), flowers, and an impressive array of dubious watches. And when hunger strikes, the market also has a colorful fresh produce section and plenty of food stalls selling classic local dishes. It’s the best place to escape from the heat, as it is naturally cool inside.","Phsar Thmei Market is located at Street 128 (Kampuchea Krom) in Phsar Thmei 1 Commune, Daun Penh District. It's open daily from 6.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. There's a taxi rank near the northwest corner of the market, and a bus stop near the southwest exit."
9,Well of Shadows,"Krong Battambang, Cambodia",A gruesome memorial for those lost in this area during the Khmer Rouge genocide.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/well-of-shadows,"The Well of Shadows is a memorial for those lost in this area during the Cambodian genocide at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. At the top, skulls of the dead are encased in a glass box—at the bottom, bas-reliefs depict the horrors that took place in the woods and rice fields surrounding the memorial. The victims commemorated by this memorial were held at a nearby temple which was seized by the Khmer Rouge and turned into a prison. An estimated 10,000 people were killed there, of the estimated 1.5-2 million deaths that occurred between 1975 and 1979. Reliquaries such as this, displaying the skulls and bones of victims that have been found, dot the country. These remains ask us to remember the atrocities committed. The bas-reliefs circling the bottom of the memorial are more unique. They illustrate in detail the particulars of different ways in which men, women, and children were tortured and killed. While the piles of remains show us the sheer numbers, these images bring home the horrors in vivid detail. The inscription on the memorial, with characteristically Cambodian optimism, reads, “The full extent of Cambodia’s tragedy will never be known. The remains of some of the victims of this genocide may never be recovered, nor their murderers identified. But the gentle and forgiving Khmer are energetic and optimistic people and will now walk confidently through the well of shadows to reclaim their ancient culture and restore this beautiful land to become again, the legendary paradise of celestial Apsaras.”","6 kilometres north of Battambang, on the east side of the Sangkar River"

But for those wanting a more intimate experience, you can have a local guide lead you up the hidden path to the mouth of the cave. Standing so close to the cloud of flying creatures whooshing out of the cave is an enthralling encounter. The bats won’t hurt you—they’re too busy hunting for bugs to even care about you—but the swarm is so large and furious you can actually feel the temperature rise as they soar overhead. The bat population is so high it can take upwards of 20 minutes for the cave to clear. Once they’re out, it’s amazing to watch the animals streak across the sky. The hordes of flying bats seem to paint the air with fluid black shapes, forming a series of striking images against a sky tinged with the last bits of sunset colors.",Phnom Sampeau is about 30 minutes south of Battambang.

11,Bamboo Trains,"Ratanak Mondul, Cambodia",A quick and simple solution to Cambodia's train woes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bamboo-trains,"Cambodia’s rail system was, for years, a cruel joke. It consisted of a single line. Trains seldom ran. When they did run, the warped, gapped, sometimes missing tracks provided a ride that maxed out around 20 miles per hour and could easily double the time of any other form of transportation. Again, that’s if the trains ran. The “Bamboo Trains,” or “noory” have been a source of transportation, commerce, and communication for those living in parts of Cambodia where access to solid roads, buses, and other automobiles was for years underdeveloped or non-existent. Unlike the hulking carriages and engines of the national line, the bamboo trains are a tinier, simpler affair—a masterpiece of necessity engineering. The body of a norry consists of a single queen-size platform, often made of bamboo, which lies on a metal undercarriage. Steel wheels on a pair of axles lie underneath. A belt wraps around the rear axle and is connected to a lawnmower or boat engine mounted on the rear of the platform. The driver yanks a cord to start it up, the engine emits its mosquito-on-steroids whine, and down the tracks it goes. Nearly a dozen passengers, livestock, or produce and other goods (or any combination thereof) can come along for the ride. The bamboo trains connect small villages and provide a means of transport for both people and goods in areas otherwise unserved. As it is a single line of parallel rails, with travelers going in both directions, a little etiquette is called for. When two noory meet on this single line of track, the lighter train stops, empties its load, the drivers and passengers disassemble the entire operation, removing it from the track so the other noory can pass. Then, they reassemble it, re-start the engine, and on their way they go, once again. It all takes about a minute. The bamboo trains were once found outside of numerous provincial towns anywhere railroad tracks had been laid. It was possible to take the bamboo trains from Battambang to Phnom Penh. As of January 2018, a new dedicated track has been built for the Bamboo Railway, due to the existing line being restored and reinstated for passenger trains and freight services later in 2018. The norry outside of Battambang are the last in existence. A ride on the bamboo trains, perhaps with a chicken, some dogs, and fellow Cambodians, is a great way to see some of the backcountry and to get a feel (bring a cushion) for just how bad the train tracks once were. All aboard!",
12,Kep-Sur-Mer,"Krong Kaeb, Cambodia",An abandoned Cambodian resort that mirrored the downfall of the country as it was happening.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kep-sur-mer,"Kep-Sur-Mer, or Kep by the Sea, (typically shortened to “Kep”) was born by royal decree in 1908 and spent its early years as a station climatique, a seaside escape for French colonial bureaucrats and their families, but now the abandoned luxury homes form a seaside ghost town. The relative stability following Cambodia’s peaceful transition to independence from France in 1953 encouraged international investment and the development of a Cambodian elite. During this boom, Kep became the premier seaside resort as the elite built villas along the gold-orange coastline. Known by various monikers such as “Cambodia’s Riviera,” or, “The St. Tropez of Southeast Asia,” Kep even flaunted a casino during its heyday. The villas took on a number of contemporary influences, from French colonial wrought iron to Le Corbusier-inspired modernism to New Khmer assertiveness. Cambodia’s aristocracy, including the charmed “Playboy King” Norodom Sihanouk, turned Kep into a Cambodian version of Gatsby’s West Egg during this period of Cambodia’s “golden age.” And like the glitzy Long Island of the 1920s, Kep-Sur-Mer’s dream couldn’t last. Cambodia’s bourgeois began the abandonment of Kep after the Lon Nol coup in 1970. The modernist villas began to fall into decay and Kep saw fighting during the Khmer Rouge takeover, which finally put a stop to any future growth. Some reports suggest the buildings were specifically targeted for destruction by the Khmer Rouge and stripped of valuables by the occupying Vietnamese army following 1979. Today the villas remain overgrown with flora and some, the ones not squatted by local residents, are structurally intact and worthy of, though not necessarily safe for, exploration. Their state of picturesque decay may not last long, however; increases in tourism to Cambodia have brought characteristic increases in foreign and local investment and development. Kep may yet see another “golden era.”",
13,Wat Phnom,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",The capital of Cambodia is named after the hill on which this ancient temple complex stands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phnom,"Built in 1372, the temple of Wat Phnom stands on the only hill in Phnom Penh, which lent the the Cambodian capital its name. According to legend, the temple was originally built to house four statues of the Buddha found in a tree floating in the nearby river. Back in 1372, or so the story goes, a wealthy widower named Daun Penh came across a fallen koki tree floating in the river near her home. Inside the tree she found four bronze statues of the Buddha. Amazed by this discovery, Penh and her neighbors built a temporary shrine on a piece of raised ground near her house. The locals called the small hill Phnom Penh, or “Penh’s Hill,” in her honor. About 60 years later, King Ponhea Yat, the last king of the Khmer Empire, moved to Phnom Penh. He gave the order to increase the size of the hill, and to build a wooden temple atop it. This was the first rebuilding of Wat Phnom—one of many over the following centuries—and the remains of Ponhea Yat are still housed in a stupa behind the main temple. The main temple was rebuilt in 1434, 1806, 1894, and 1926. Its importance rose and fell over the years, depending on the whims of kings, and extensive renovations were made to fit the ideologies of various rulers, including the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot. New shrines and statues have been added, and the original walls plastered and painted over on numerous occasions. Today, the temple is an amalgam of styles and structures from across its more than 600-year history, including gardens built by the French in the late 19th century and shrines that represent Taoist, Confucian, and Hindu beliefs. The grand main entrance runs up the eastern stairway, its path guarded by lions and naga, the mythical snakes of Hinduism and Buddhism. Inside the temple sits a large bronze Buddha, the walls covered by paintings that tell his story, and murals that recount the Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana. Many more shrines dot the sides and base of the hill, but few are more important than the shrine to Daun Penh, the supposed founder of the wat. The front of her shrine is often crowded with people leaving offerings of food and praying to Daun Penh, and many women come here to pay tribute to the temple’s female founder. Other notable features include a little shrine dedicated to the spirit or genie Preah Chau, which is thought to offer protection from enemies and is especially popular among the Vietnamese community. There’s also the over 200-foot-wide flower clock, originally a gift from France in the 1960s, but replaced in 2000 by a new version given as a gift by China.","Wat Phnom is located north of Road 102, Norodom Boulevard, in the center of Phnom Penh. It's open from 7 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. Entrance is $1, and $2 for the on-site museum. Prepare yourself for a somewhat chaotic scene when you arrive and begin the walk to the top of the hill. Pushy vendors and beggars vie for your attention, but it's easy enough to navigate; just hold on to your wallet. You should also avoid the people selling birds in cages. Often children are the ones doing this. The idea is that you pay to have the bird released, but the birds are typically trained to return to their cages, or they die from the stress of the whole experience. To make things worse, some of the birds are endangered species."

15,Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",Khmer Rouge's high security prison.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuol-seng,"Tuol Sleng is nestled within in the heart of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. From the outside it looks unremarkable: a multi-story former high school with whitewashed walls and grey shutters. However, inside, Tuol Sleng holds a dark history. Under the Khmer Rouge, Tuol Sleng was transformed from a school into Security prison 21 (S-21), a place in which some of the most violent atrocities of the Pol Pot’s regime were perpetrated. Originally named Chao Ponhea Yat High School, the complex includes five buildings in total. Several months after the Khemer Rouge took power in 1975, they implemented measures to convert the high school into a high-security facility. Between 1975 and 1979 it is estimated that over 15,000 people were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng. The prison held between 1,000 and 1,500 occupants along with a large security force. Life within the prison was terrible, and the people imprisoned at Tuol Sleng were treated cruelly. Prisoners were shackled into their cells, forbidden to talk to one another and frequently beaten and tortured by the guards. All prisoners were interrogated during their stay at Tuol Sleng. These interrogations normally included torture: Prisoners were shocked with electricity, burned with irons and water-boarded. In 2010, Cambodia convicted Kang Kek Iew, the chief of Tuol Sleng Prison, for crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and died while still in custody in 2020. Today, the former prison stands as a monument to the brutalities of the Khmer Rouge. It is now a museum dedicated to preserving the memory of those who passed through its gates. Several of the implements that were used to torture the prisoners are also on display along with a “skull map,” a map of Cambodia made entirely from human skulls and bones. Rooms that were once used to torture and abuse are now lined with thousands of photographs of those who were incarcerated there.","Located in the heart of the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. The museum is open to the public from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m."
16,Yeak Laom,"Krong Ban Lung, Cambodia","Arguing within this idyllic, circular volcanic lake is forbidden.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yeak-laom,"The shores of Yeak Laom Lake form an almost perfect circle. And though the lake has a small circumference, it’s just shy of 160 feet (about 48 meters) deep. Its shape and depth are due to its volcanic origin. It’s believed that 4,000 years ago, a volcanic eruption created a crater that, over time, filled with water. The lake was once surrounded by thick forest on all sides, but today only a thin layer remains, with most of the land having been farmed. The waters of Yeak Laom are crystal clear, and they stand in stark contrast with the bright green in the background—if you visit during or shortly after the rainy season. Exotic birds and butterflies are common sights, and wild pigs may also come around. Although the lake is considered sacred by the local people, swimming or playing in the water is common for both locals and tourists. Wooden docks with steps have been built to facilitate access. In 2018, bureaucratic procedures were started to register Yeak Laom and the land around it as state land to better protect the environment. Other measures to protect the lake forbid people from using detergents, gambling, or having arguments while in the lake. Five villages are located around the lake. A combination of trails and wooden planks encircles the 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometers) of the lake’s shores. Along the way is a small visitor center with information about the lake and handicrafts for sale.","Yeak Laom is located roughly three miles (five kilometers) from the Ratanakiri provincial capital Banlung, which is ideal for a bike ride. This site can also be reached easily by taxis or motorbikes. Ratanakiri was heavily bombed during the Second Indochina War, and unexploded ordnance is occasionally found in the region. Going off the (literal) beaten path may not be your better option here."

The name Phimeanakas actually translates to “Celestial Palace.” Construction started at the end of the 10th-century during the reign of Rajendravarma II and was completed by Suryavarma I. It went on to become the state temple of Suryavarman I and the focal point of his capital. The structure was also used by King Jayavarman VII as his private temple and was designed in laterite, a type of clay. Atop the pyramid was a tower that rose from a platform. At the center of the platform now sit the ruins of a small cruciform sanctuary. Along the edge of the top platform are covered galleries. These were the first vaulted galleries to be constructed in Angkor. At the corners of each of the tiers are guardian elephant statues. At the base, the structure measures 82 feet (35 meters) long and 91 feet (28 meters) wide. A very steep stairway leads to the top. All four sides are guarded by lion statues. Around 200 years after its construction, the temple was swallowed up by the city temple of Angkor Thom. It now sits atmospherically hidden among the trees that subsequently swallowed the city.",
19,Cambodia Landmine Museum,"Kampong Thom, Cambodia",This collection of reclaimed landmines acts as both an exhibition of their deadly history and as a shelter for children affected by them.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cambodian-landmine-museum,"Landmines leftover in war-torn countries such as Cambodia cause innumerable injuries and deaths each year, often with little to no government support for clean-up or support of the victims. However, one Cambodian man’s demining efforts have grown into an educational and inspiring center that not only tells the history of the deadly leftovers but also works to care for those most affected by their violence: children. As a former member of the Khmer Rouge, Cambodian-born Aki Ra, was no stranger to landmines, having placed thousands of them himself. However when the Khmer regime fell Ra used his knowledge to help heal the country by working with the UN as a demining specialist. After working with the UN force for only a year Ra returned to his small village community and began disarming mines in his home area using little more than a stick and a multi-tool. Soon word spread of not only his quest, but of the collection of decommissioned ordinance he was amassing. Ra began traveling from village to village either picking up landmines he himself had laid or answering the pleas of communities that had found or detonated their own. While some of the mines were sold for scrap to fund his humanitarian efforts, he personally kept a number of them. As interest in Ra’s collection grew among foreign visitors, the idea for the Cambodian Landmine Museum was born. At first, the museum was simply a tour of his personal collection, but as it grew, in size and popularity the museum was finally established in 1997. Unfortunately, the Cambodian government almost immediately ordered it shut down, so Ra simply moved it to a national park and created a brand new NGO (non-governmental organization) under which the museum could operate. Today the museum has grown to include displays of Ra’s collected landmines as well as exhibits on the wars that left them including sinister-looking mannequins. In addition to the museum displays, Ra began taking in children injured or orphaned by the landmines he was collecting among the villages, giving them a shelter and a future. This side of the museum has even been expanded to include children who simply have emotional or familial problems. Currently there are dozens of children being housed, fed, and educated by the center, which is an impressive feat for a museum that began with clean-up duty.","Approximately 25 km north of Siem Reap (30 minutes by tuk tuk), and 7km south of the Banteay Srey Temple complex in Angkor National Park"
20,Tonle Srepok,"Lumphat, Cambodia",The river depicted in the antiwar film 'Apocalypse Now' was likely based on this Mekong tributary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tonle-srepok,"Tonle Srepok is a major tributary of the Mekong River that runs between the Vietnamese province of Đắk Lắk, and the Ratanakiri and Stung Treng provinces in Cambodia. Before the development of modern roads, the river was crucially important to Lao, Khmer, and Vietnamese people for trading purposes, and as a supply line during the U.S.-Vietnam War. Tonle Srepok (also called the Srepok or Serepok River) was along a branch of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and was used to supply North Vietnamese forces fighting in South Vietnam with weapons, ammunition, and food. When the U.S. Army discovered this, the whole area was heavily bombed, leaving behind a huge amount of unexploded ordnance that even today maims those unfortunate enough to step on or hit one. Rumors of U.S. Special Forces infiltrating Ratanakiri province abound—as to the veracity of these rumors, opinions vary. As for Apocalypse Now, in a nutshell, Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 film portrays Captain Willard’s journey along a river going from Vietnam to Cambodia on a mission to find and assassinate renegade Colonel Kurtz. It’s unlikely the scenes were actually shot on the Srepok River, as Coppola was forced to film the movie in the Philippines due to security reasons in Cambodia. However, it’s often said that the river in the film was meant to depict the Tonle Srepok, which may well be true. Among all the sizeable rivers running from Vietnam to Cambodia through heavily forested areas, Tonlé Srepok is the most likely to fit the bill. On a side note, in one of the last scenes of the movie, a water buffalo is sacrificed in a ritual. Coppola maintains that he simply encountered that version of the ritual among the Filipino people he was working with, but surprisingly, a similar ritual is also performed among the Kachok living in Ratanakiri along Tonle Srepok. It’s probably a coincidence, but interesting nonetheless.","If you want to see TonleSrepok before it merges with other rivers, the best place is Lumphat. Alternatively, Road no. 76 runs south from Lumphat, across the Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary, and along Tonle Srepok, and for the first couple of kilometers, this road is about 2 km from the river. Further south, the road diverges to a distance of about 15 km, and having a guide vastly increases the chance of finding the river, and more importantly, finding the way back to the road. Due to the presence of unexploded ordnance, you should not stray off well-trodden paths."

Called the “Queen’s Palace,” the mansion was never completed and Sihanouk never stayed there. The mansion itself is largely gutted and enjoyable to explore and there is a nice view of the sea.

Often less busy than its more famous counterparts, the temple has an interesting history and hidden statue. It has a wonderful approach along its long, raised processional path passing between the remains of its reflection pools. Built in the 11th century as the state temple for Udayadityavarman II, Baphuon was originally dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. But in the late 15th century, the three-tiered temple was converted to a Buddhist site. As a result of this conversion, hidden on the west-facing section of the third enclosure wall is a giant reclining Buddha.  The brickwork forming the reclining Buddha image is nine meters (30 feet) tall and 70 meters (230 feet) long. The statue was built into the west side of the temple’s second level, which probably required the demolition of an eight-meter (26-foot) tower to supply stones for the statue. Walking around the base of the temple is uncanny, as what initially appears to be oddly-placed blocks in the wall start to take on the shape of the Buddha’s face. Almost as soon as you see it, the image starts to disappear again as the profile changes once you are directly opposite. The temple was constructed on land filled with sand. Due to its immense size, the site was incredibly unstable throughout its history. It is thought that large portions had already collapsed by the time the Buddha was added. By the 20th century, much of the temple had collapsed. A large-scale restoration project saw the temple dismantled so that its core could be strengthened before its reconstruction. This process was interrupted when the Cambodian Civil War broke out in 1970. Archaeologists were forced to leave the 300,000 blocks carefully numbered and organized over 10 hectares of land surrounding the temple site. Unfortunately, these plans were lost during the Khmer Rouge conflict. It was not until April 2011, after 51 years of work, that the restored temple was unveiled and the giant Buddha’s face once again stared serenely out of the complex once again.",Follow the Buddha's serene gaze out towards the jungle and you will spot a trail through the trees.

23,Al-Serkal Mosque,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",The largest mosque in Cambodia was built to unite the country's Muslim community but soon sparked division and controversy instead.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alserkal-mosque,"Al-Serkal Mosque is the principal mosque in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. Not only is it one of the newest mosques in the majority Buddhist country, it is also the largest. The impressive structure has been widely celebrated by Cambodia’s minority Muslim population, while at the same time creating rifts in the very community it was built to unite. Al-Serkal Mosque was inaugurated in March 2015 in the Boeng Kak neighborhood of Phnom Penh. Officially opened by Prime Minister Hun Sen, the inaugural ceremony was attended by more than 1,000 people. Among them was Eisa Bin Nasser Bin Abdullatif Alserkal, the Emirati businessman who funded the construction at a cost of $2.9 million. The walls inside the two-story Ottoman-style mosque are lined with rose and turquoise tiles, the ceramics commissioned from Algerian artisans. Its ceilings are decorated with mosaics, and a chandelier hangs from the central dome. To keep the faithful cool, the whole thing is air-conditioned. For Cambodia’s 350,000 or so Muslims (about 2 percent of the population), especially those in the capital, the construction of such a fine mosque was a grand achievement. The majority of Cambodia’s Muslim population is ethnic Cham. About 70,000 Cham Muslims died under the Khmer Rouge, and throughout the 1980s they were allowed limited religious freedom. It wasn’t long after the inauguration of the Al-Serkal Mosque, however, that rifts began to form in the Muslim community for which the mosque was built. In 2016, a planned road-building project was announced which would see a new road run right through the land on which the mosque sits. Many members of the local Cham Muslim community were opposed to the construction, as the road, if built, would destroy the tranquility of the mosque, ruining the peace and calm of prayer. Some of the Cham leadership, however, supported its construction, arguing that the road would ease traffic congestion and flooding, as well as bring new opportunities and greater prosperity to the area. Protests ensued, politicians got involved, accusations began to fly, and the whole issue caused quite a stir. The road project seems to have stalled for now, and could well be scrapped—or the proposed route changed – to appease angered locals. As for the mosque, it remains a much-loved hub for the Muslim community of Phnom Penh and of Cambodia as a whole.","Al-Serkal Mosque is located at 1 St. 86, not far from the city center of Phnom Penh. There's a large parking area if you drive yourself, or you can get there by taxi/tuk-tuk. You'll find a few halal stalls and restaurants in the area around the mosque. The busiest time at the mosque is during Friday prayers."
24,Kampong Chhnang Airport,"Rolea Baear, Cambodia",The abandoned airport is a strangely intact remnant of Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kampong-chhnang-airport,"Though abandoned, the exacting standards to which this airport’s runways and concrete roadways must have been held to are evidenced by the uncracked, weedless surfaces, even all these years later. The strangely intact airport exists as a somber reminder of the atrocities committed under Pol Pot’s rule. The military airport was the product of forced labor under the horrific governance of the Khmer Rouge, followers of the communist regime that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. Construction on this military airbase began in 1977, but it was never completed—the project was abandoned in 1979 when Vietnamese forces invaded and occupied Cambodia. Though never used for any actual aviation, the land holds several abandoned roadways leading to shells of old buildings, water tanks, and the vast airstrips themselves. Adjacent to the runway is a small control tower-type building. Thousands of workers died while building the airport. They were forced to work in inhumane conditions under the reign of the radical regime. Many of the laborers were members of the military who had been sent to work at the site as a punishment. Their work was overseen by engineers from China, as the Chinese government had a keen interest in helping build the airport.","While the roads leading to decaying buildings are easily accessible, there is a guard posted at the runway. They may be unconcerned by your presence, or you may not be allowed to pass. Alternately, some visitors have been required to pay a ""fee."" Going with someone that speaks Khmer is the least stressful way to access the site. Additionally, it appears locals might be using the control tower and additional buildings for their own purposes, so it is best to maintain a respectful distance ."
25,Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia","Bombed and burned, this monument represents the often controversial ties between Vietnam and Cambodia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cambodia-vietnam-friendship-monument,"The Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument stands in a normally peaceful park near the center of Phnom Penh. But that peace has been shattered on a number of occasions, by political activists who see the monument more as a memorial to the Vietnamese occupation. On December 25, 1978, Vietnam invaded the state of Democratic Kampuchea in present-day Cambodia. Its ultimately successful goal was the removal of the Khmer Rouge government from power, but the invasion also led to a 10-year occupation of the country. In 1979, the occupying Vietnamese built a large concrete monument in Botum Park, not far from the Royal Palace in the heart of Phnom Penh. Built in the distinctly communist socialist-realist style, it features two soldiers standing side-by-side, one Vietnamese and one Cambodian, with a Cambodian woman holding a baby as she stands under their protective gaze. Behind them rises the concrete tower, its top decorated with gold. On a typical day in Botum Park, this monument is the backdrop for family gatherings, friendly games of soccer, enthusiastic aerobics sessions, and occasional concerts. But in the last 20 or so years, the monument has also attracted the wrath of activists and protesters. They see the statue as a gross oversimplification of the former alliance between Vietnam and Cambodia, and a representation of the overly-close ties between Cambodian political leaders and Hanoi. The first major attack on the monument came in 1998, when opposition protesters attacked the statue with hammers before climbing it, dousing it with petrol and setting it alight. It was repaired two months later. Then, on July 29, 2007, a 10-kilogram bomb detonated at the base of the monument. The park was evacuated and two more devices were defused. Despite the blast, no one was injured and the monument suffered little damage. In 2015, a newly formed Cambodian think tank controversially argued for the removal of the monument and others like it. These statues were problematic, they argued, as they didn’t represent an accurate depiction of the civil war period, and were nothing more than “occupation memorials that continue to divide Cambodia.” The open letter from the think tank stated that more inclusive memorials should be erected in place of the existing monuments. These would ideally go far beyond the oversimplified Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument and its like, recognizing the full extent of the decades-long war while addressing the “geopolitical power struggles, instigated by the US, the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Britain and France” that also played a role. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the debate gained little traction and the old monuments still stand. So for now, at least, the Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument remains a focal point of Botum Park, where locals practice their afternoon exercises and friendly games of sepak takraw.","The gold-topped Cambodia–Vietnam Friendship Monument is easy to spot when you arrive in Botum Park. It's a good place for people watching throughout the day, although the best atmosphere is often after 5 p.m. when people come to hang out, exercise, and play sports."

APOPO was founded in 1997 by Bart Weetjens, a Belgian product designer who was searching for a more affordable way to help clear landmines. As an owner of pet rats, he knew that they were intelligent, social creatures with a keen sense of smell, and reasoned that they could be trained to detect buried landmines, small arms, and unexploded ordnance. The group’s HeroRATs, as they call them, are specially trained to sniff out mines (and tuberculosis). They can smell as little as one trillionth of a gram of TNT a meter deep in the ground. This incredible nonprofit has drastically increased both safety and productivity in the finding of unexploded ordnance. An area the size of a tennis field would take a human about four days to search, while the same area can be covered in 30 minutes by one rat.

Sadly, their peculiarities and rareness have put them in danger, and they are increasingly under threat in the wild. Although protected under Cambodian law, the rare scaly anteater is endangered in the wild where it is poached for meat and for its scales. These nocturnal forest dwellers are mild mannered and slow, making them an unfortunately easy target. Of the eight species of pangolin, two of them are considered endangered, including the Sunda, or Malay, Pangolin native to Southeast Asia. Their natural predators are tigers and other wild cats, but humans are the greatest danger to their long term survival. Pangolin meat is valued in parts of Asia as an exotic dish, fetching high prices in the black market. Its scales are ground up and used as an aphrodisiac. While no one knows the exact extent of the black market trade, in 2013 a Chinese ship containing 10,000 kilograms of pangolin meat ran aground in a protected coral reef in the Philippines, giving some sense of the vast scale of the market. The sanctuary at Phnom Tamao Zoological Park opened in 2012 to protect and provide sanitary for animals no longer able to get by in the wild, often found injured by hunter’s traps.

Today, the FCC has retained the atmosphere of its earlier days, although the clientele has shifted from war reporters to expats and visiting tourists. After the signing of the Paris Peace Agreements of October 1991, foreign journalists started to pour into Phnom Penh as Cambodia began its move towards peace and stability. Decades of turmoil, of civil war and Cold War intrigues, had torn the country apart, and the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge were yet to be put on trial. Lacking a place to call their own, and bored of drinking in rundown bars in the capital, a small group of journalists came up with the idea of establishing their own club for expatriate reporters and photographers in Phnom Penh. So was born the Foreign Correspondents Club, located in a three-story colonial-style building with exceptional views over the Tonle Sap River. The doors opened in June 1993. During the launch party, co-founder and Agence France-Presse correspondent Leo Dobbs stood up on one of the club’s wooden art deco-like chairs and made a succinct but important announcement: the FCC, he told the gathered revelers, “is a place where we can offer friendship between Cambodians and the rest of the world.” Over the following years, the FCC played a vital role for journalists in Cambodia. Not only as a bar and restaurant, it also became a leading cultural and intellectual center in Phnom Penh. It held panel discussions on human rights, press conferences, photo exhibitions, and featured a range of guest speakers and panelists from various walks of life, including politicians, authors, dancers, journalists, royal biographers, and Buddhist monks. Today, the FCC remains an iconic landmark in Phnom Penh, although the link between the club and the foreign correspondents it was created for has diminished. It’s still just as popular, but you’re more likely to find regular locals, expats, and tourists sipping gin and tonic at the bar rather than war photographers from Reuters. That said, the FCC does retain much of its old atmosphere, and the sense of history and adventure is palpable as you sit beneath the ceiling fans, looking out across the river. You never know when a journalist or a high-level diplomat might pop in. In 2016, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited the FCC before a series of meetings with Cambodian leaders.","The FCC is now a hotel, restaurant, and bar, all open to the public (accredited foreign correspondents still receive a discount). The menu includes various cocktails and plenty of dining options, many of which blend Cambodian and Western influences.

Despite its otherworldly appearance, the lush red grasses of this Chinese marsh have all too Earthly, if still rare, origin.

This graceful animal is also known as a symbol of luck, longevity and fidelity. Governmentally protected, tourists can walk among the rare reeds via specially installed wooden walkways that extend out over the delicate ecosystem.

32,Avatar Hallelujah Mountain,"Zhangjiajie, China",This vertical pinnacle in China was the inspiration for the floating mountains in the movie “Avatar.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/avatar-hallelujah-mountain,"It wasn’t until 1982 that China created its first national park: Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. They couldn’t have chosen a better site—Zhangjiajie is famous for its 3,000 vertical pillars, each standing hundreds of feet tall and covered in dense green foliage. These pillars were formed by erosion and draw in upwards of 30 million tourists every year. One of these pillars was named the “Southern Sky Column,” and it stretches 3,544 feet into the air, the length of 78 school buses. In a strange turn of art imitating life imitating art, in 2010 the name was changed to “Avatar Hallelujah Mountain” after the highest-grossing film of all time, Avatar, used photographs of the pinnacle as inspiration for the floating Hallelujah Mountains of Pandora. This was part of a successful attempt to bring more tourists into the national park, using phrases like “Pandora is far but Zhangjiajie is near” and “discover the real world of Pandora.” This, of course, was not all good news for the Chinese government. The state-run “China Film Group” was afraid that Avatar would inspire people to make connections between the plight of Pandora’s fictional “Na’vi” people, who were being displaced from their land for the purpose of economic expansion, and the plight of the millions of real Chinese civilians being evicted from their homes to serve the interests of urban developers. Hence, in a wildly controversial move, just 14 days after being released in China, Avatar was prematurely taken off of 1,628 2D screens. Two weeks too late. By that point Avatar had already become China’s highest-grossing film of all time, and “Avatar Hallelujah Mountain” continues to be the name of the pinnacle, despite the government’s censorship efforts of the film. The connection to Avatar has surged the popularity of Zhangjiajie. To cater to the more adventurous tourists in the area, a new attraction was built in the national park in 2015: the longest glass bridge in the world.",

In the early 1990s, when the small bay became increasingly unable to meet the growing fish industry’s needs, residents began migrating to the mainland in search of other employment and a better life, a pattern that was common in many small Chinese villages. Slowly, nearly every house was abandoned, and only a handful of residents now remain. Over the past two decades, the forces of green took over, plastering nearly every surface of the settlement with dense overgrown foliage. Adding to the otherworldliness, a peek inside the deserted houses reveals decaying household items and pieces of furniture frozen exactly as they were placed years ago before the inhabitants left. Now, some villagers who used to live in Houtouwan have found another form of income in tourism, showing an ever-increasing stream of visitors the lush landscape, and selling them water, the only item on offer on the island. The scenery is green as far as the eye can see, making this a wondrous sight, and a photographer’s paradise.",

Separated into an inner and outer court, the Forbidden City forms a rectangle several thousand feet long and wide, with a moat surrounding all four sides.  The huge estate contains five major gates and numerous halls, large and small, each with grandiose names such as the “Gate of Divine Might” and the “Hall of Literary Glory.” Construction began in 1402 and lasted for 16 years, employing over a million workers.  It served as the seat of the Ming Dynasty from 1420 until 1644, at which point it housed the heads of the Qing Dynasty until 1912. After the Emperor Puyi abdicated in 1912, the Forbidden City underwent several periods of turmoil, including the evacuation (some would say theft) of numerous artifacts to Taiwan in 1948 by a fleeing Chian Kai-shek of the Guomindang.  It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, and today the entire complex is part of the Palace Museum, whose collection includes over ten thousand ancient fans, among other artifacts and priceless works of Chinese art.  Besides the pieces contained inside, visitors can admire the high imperial architecture, as well as a mingling of religious influences including Taoism, Manchu shamanism, and Tibetan Buddhism. Easily one of the most visited locations in China, The Forbidden City is a one-of-kind monument to one of the most culturally rich periods in Asia’s history.",

Usually shrouded in blinding sunlight or dense fog, visitors climb 999 steps to reach the peak, where they end their trip 4,100 feet up, in a realm where legend believes the gods meet the mortal world. 420 feet high and 180 feet wide, the cave slit of the “Gateway to Heaven” is visible from any distance below the cave. The exhaustive hike up the hill follows an old path of carved stone stairs, dotted with small wooden huts. The entire path is guided by the portal at the peak, but the views on the way up make it obvious why generations of people in Hunan believed that Tianmen Shan was the realm of the gods.",

Filled with awe-inspiring creatures known only to China it has been dubbed “Fairy Land on Earth.” Over millennia of geological change, mineral deposits built up and naturally created the travertine pools of Huanglong. Formed out of limestone, the hot springs rose to varied levels, making the light blue water cascade over waterfalls into other series of pools and even hollowing out caves along the valley. With rugged, snow-capped peaks on both sides, the slicing river of hot springs looks almost like a dragon, earning the title of “Yellow Dragon.” In many ways, the backdrop of this UNESCO site is as dramatic as the pools. Untouched forests gently slope toward the water, and Golden Snub-Nosed Monkeys and Giant Pandas have made the fantasy world their home. The most scenic 2.2 miles begin at the Benbo temple and gradually wind their way to the Xishen Cave Waterfalls where the main site ends.

Vivid reds, oranges, and yellows stripe along the mountains in technicolor harmony with rocks allegedly shaped like animals and mythical creatures. This geological park also offers several hiking areas and scenic overlooks to fully enjoy the color. That being said, visitors don’t need to struggle to see the rainbow rocks. Where did the rainbow come from? The answer is not as magical as one might hope: different layers of sandstone dating back millions of years. With erosion, wind, and weather, the colorful layers were formed. But what matters isn’t why there are rainbow mountains, but that somewhere out in the wild, a place like this actually exists.

The internet community has debated its reality, and its sweeping palette of farmland has dropped the jaws of many pragmatists, convinced the landscape has been photoshopped. But it hasn’t. Luoxiagou, a small village in the Dongchuan Red Land, is actually that colorful, and that breathtaking, and truly exists in southern China. The area earned the name “Red Land” due to its striking colors. The base color of the earth in Luoxiagou is tinted with oxidized iron. Nearly saturated with the mineral, the dirt has taken on a dark brown and reddish hue. Yet the soil is only the beginning of the fantastic countryside. Some 26,00 feet above sea level, an ocean of farmland and white flowers grow from farmland splotched with patches of oxidized red dirt. Without much infrastructure or government organization, the region is largely comprised of unaffiliated farmers who plant individual crops on the terraced slopes of the province. Although the lack of organization has left the area underdeveloped, it has also caused the stark differences in color and crop in the swimming farmland of Luoxiagou, and has made the land a stunning natural portrait.",

Located under the iconic Oriental Pearl Tower, the tunnel was built to be one of the Bund’s major tourist attractions, and still manages to draw large numbers of travelers despite costing more than ten times as much as the metro. Although riders do get a rather mind-blowing (if dated) experience. After hopping into a small, futuristic rail car, riders are leisurely carried through a tunnel which is covered in pulsing, strobing lights that attempt to simulate flight through some acid-soaked version of space. The bombardment of flashing lights and colors is accompanied by a rather ominous soundtrack punctuated by an occasional intonation of English words such as “…shining star…” and “…hell…” It is unclear whether the ride is trying to evoke wonder or terror, but both reactions seem appropriate. Despite its name, the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel offers no Shanghai sights other than its own sensory bombardment. The entire ride lasts just under five minutes, but the mind-blowing light show could have much more lasting effects.","Price is 50 RMB one way, 70 for a round trip"

There, after ascending to the top of the Great Wall via gondola, chairlift, or foot, you can return to the base by zooming down a steep, zig-zagging slide, with views of the Great Wall along the way. The ride, which runs adjacent to the wall, lasts about five minutes depending on how much you apply the brakes with the joystick attached to your cart.

Over the millennia seismic activity and water and wind erosion have carved the present-day limestone formations. The giant stalagmite-like pillars create huge arrays of labyrinths that are easy to become lost in. Shilin is divided into many smaller stone forests and features caves, waterfalls, ponds, a lake with an island, and even an underground river. Two of the smaller individual stone forests, Naigu Stone Forest and Suogeyi Village, are a part of the South China Karst, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. One of Shilin’s most famous attractions is the Ashima Stone, which legend says was formed after the beautiful Sani girl, Ashima, ran into the forest and was turned to stone after being forbidden to marry the man she loved. Every year on June 24 the local Sani people hold the time-honored Torch Festival at Shilin, which features many “traditional performances such as wrestling, bull fighting, pole-climbing, dragon-playing, lion-dancing, and the A-xi Moon Dance.”",

Black mirrored floors shimmer beneath arched shelves that stretch to the ceiling, creating the illusion of a never-ending tunnel of books. A zig-zagging gap prevents the top of the shelves from touching. When reflected on the floor below, the lighting bolt shape, which represents a river, acts as a pathway to entice visitors to drift deeper within the building. People who pass through the tunnel can pause to pluck books from the shelves. Those who carry on trekking through the trippy optical illusion will find additional architectural gems at the end. The tunnel leads to a children’s reading room. Here, a series of LED lights turns the ceiling into night sky freckled with stars that twinkle above bright, whimsical shelves. There’s also an adult reading room full of curvy architecture and, of course, more books to browse.

Calcite formations are still visible on some of the walls, and waterfalls with quaint names sprinkle down from on high.

Allegedly, its landscape even inspired the scenery of James Cameron’s Avatar. But it’s not rock formations or trees that tourists have been flocking for lately–it’s a bridge. A 1,400-foot-long, 900-foot-high bridge made out of glass. This bridge, opened in the summer of 2016, comes as part of a trend in glass suspension structures. There’s “Brave Men’s Bridge”, located in the same natural preserve as the Zhangjiajie bridge, as well as a swath of other Chinese glass bridges in both urban and natural settings. All of these have been constructed within a decade of each other, each trumping the last in superlatives. The Zhangjiajie glass bridge currently holds the record as both the longest and the highest in the world. The appeal of these attractions is both the ability to see the natural landscape below one’s feet and the element of fear inherent in walking on such a massive structure made of delicate material. As if that wasn’t enough to terrify, one of China’s other glass walkways cracked under the feet of visitors just two weeks after its opening. Though authorities assured the public the crack in the glass was merely superficial and no one was in any danger, it’s understandable why people were scared. When the Zhangjiajie bridge was unveiled, a number of publicity events were staged to prove the bridge’s sturdiness, including driving a car across it and whacking the inches-thick glass panes with sledgehammers. The bridge stood the test, but to ensure safety only 600-800 people are allowed to partake in its glass wonder at any given time.",

The futuristically modern museum is packed with wax watermelons, displaying the various varieties from around the world, surrounded by abundant neon lighting. The displays cover just about every aspect of watermelons from their history, to growing methods, to China’s “watermelon culture.” There are ancient Chinese poems on display that make reference to melons, and all sorts of informational signs and plaques. Even the building itself is emblazoned with a giant impressionistic watermelon over the front doors. And if you find the permanent fake melons a bit disingenuous,  there is also an outdoor exhibition area where a number of actual watermelon varieties are growing.

Mount Hua actually consists of five separate peaks, each with a temple on it thanks to the religious significance that has been ascribed to the mountain for centuries. However, the most remote peak to the south is home to a temple that has incorporated a tea ceremony to answer the demands of the increased number of visitors who are drawn to the site by the pull of danger. To reach the temple, you must begin at a series of steps known as the “Heavenly Stairs,” a long trail of stone steps carved right into the mountain that is so steep, one slip could cause hikers to tumble down them uncontrollably. Or, you can take a rickety gondola that ferries hikers high above a mountain valley to the base of the northern peak. For the ascent of the southern peak, the trail almost completely disappears as hikers must sidle along the sheer mountainside across a thin ledge made of what looks like scrap wood, stapled and lashed together like an afterthought. Even the planks fall away at some point leaving nothing but a chain and some pegs to stand on, hundreds of feet off the ground. Once past this section, another set of worn stairs leads to the temple, although their sharp grade makes the previous steps seem like child’s play. Thanks to the increasing number of visitors to the site in recent years, the Chinese government has taken steps to make the route safer, by shoring up the ledge planks and cementing in more guide chains. However despite the increased safety precautions a number of hikers each year continue to plummet to their deaths from the dizzying trail. But no matter how many people continue to perish on the often snow-covered path, the promise of serenity and a warm cup of hard-earned tea keep people coming back in larger numbers each year.",

It attracts tourists from all over and even many visitors from within China as it is the place to learn about Chinese ghost culture and the afterlife. Visitors to the area find that they are moved by the ancient craftsmen, the unique styles of architecture, and the nagging lesson that good is rewarded with good, and evil with evil. The city has been around for nearly 2,000 years, filling it with a spooky sense of the past. Its origin story begins back in the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), when two officials decided to run away to the area and live out their lives, where they eventually, the story goes, became immortal. Yin and Wang, the names of the officials, were combined during a later dynasty to mean “King of the Underworld.” Most of the popular landmarks in the City of Ghosts have names that reference the afterlife: “Last Glance at Home Tower,” “Nothing-to-be-Done Bridge,” “Ghost Torturing Pass.” Covering the sites are statues and other artistic depictions of ghosts and devils — terrifying works that represent what happens to those who haven’t lived good lives after theirs is taken from them. Less popular, but no less fascinating is the theme park/haunted house made to represent the terrors within the afterlife, complete with neon paint and vendors hawking Scream masks alongside an alleyway. The giant face seen in the hill is called “The Ghost King,” and it holds a Guinness World Records title as the biggest sculpture carved on a rock.

First organized in 1963, the Festival was often interrupted over the years due to the Cultural Revolution. It picked up again, this time as an annual event, in 1985. The official starting date is January 5th, lasting until February 15th, though weather permitting, the exhibitions often open a week earlier and run until March. Each year has a different ‘theme,’ past themes including the Beijing Olympics, Chinese tourist sites, ‘Prosperous China and High-Flying Longjiang’, and ‘Friendship between China and Russia.’ The Great Wall (doubling as an ice slide), pyramids, sphinxes, terra cotta warriors, a Disney castle, towering pagodas, enormous Buddhas, and gardens are only a handful of the creative sculptures and carvings to have been a part of the Harbin Festival. It is a competitive event, with teams coming from all over the world-the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Africa, France etc. During the nights of the month-long festival, lights from inside and outside of the sculptures brilliantly illuminate a variety of architectural styles, fanciful castles, mythological and historical figures, ice lanterns and slides. Fireworks light up the sky on various evenings while the dazzling multicolored ice sculptures light up the entire ground.

Boat tours give onlookers a chance to see the Buddha from a manageable distance, but many people choose to take a closer look. A narrow stairway is bolted to the cliff next to the statue, and from there visitors can appreciate the massive scale of the Leshan Buddha as they descend.

Every year, thousands of tourists flock to climb the stone stairs at Badaling, just outside of Beijing, with the more adventurous ones going for hikes along the ”wild” wall sections like Chenjiapu or Qinglongqiao. The views from those hikes are beautiful indeed. But as you stand atop a 600-year-old wall fortress, contemplating the serpentine white lines that stretch for miles along mountain ridges, the question inevitably pops up: Does the Great Wall of China have a starting point? If so, where? The answer lies in the small town of Shanhaiguan in Hebei province. Old Dragon’s Head is considered to be the start of the Great Wall, built during the Ming Dynasty, and it does resemble a dragon resting its weary head by the Bohai Sea. It served as a military fort, and a strategic defense from both land and sea attacks. Going down towards the sea, there are well-preserved remnants of the original wall, which was built using a mixture of glutinous rice syrup, earth, sand and lime.","Direct high-speed train from Beijing to Shanhaiguan takes about 2-3 hours.

54,Booming Dunes of Badain Jaran Desert,"Alxa, China",The tallest stationary dunes on Earth also happen to sing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/booming-dunes-badain-desert,"Badain Jaran Desert is home to the tallest stationary dunes on Earth. Reaching over 1,600 feet tall, they are roughly the same height as the world’s tallest buildings. This area also shares a mysterious property with some three dozen other deserts around the world. Known as singing sands, whistling sands, or booming dunes, the dunes of the Badain Jaran Desert make a surprising amount of noise. Despite singing sands and booming dunes being a feature shared by some 35 deserts and beaches around the world, the mechanism that makes the sound is still not fully understood. Singing sands are believed to be generated when the desert wind pulls the top layer of sand off the layer below. It is thought that the noise is generated by an electrostatic charge this action creates. On a small scale, such as a beach, this phenomenon creates a high-pitched sound, but on a much larger scale, it can emit a low-pitched rumble or booming sound, and at up to 105 decibels, it can be quite loud. A booming sand dune manifests itself by initiating an avalanche from the leeward face of a large dune. The resulting low-frequency booming noise or music is loud and resembles a low-flying propeller airplane. The sound is surprisingly monotone with one dominant audible frequency. It is sustained and may continue for up to a minute after initiation, even after all visible motion has ceased. Moving a hand through the dry sand of a booming dune shears the upper layer and generates another acoustic phenomenon, the burping emission - pulse-like, short bursts of sound. Booming dunes are silent in the wintertime when moisture from precipitation is retained in the dune. The burping property depends on sand grain characteristics and can be generated all year around. In the summer time when the larger dunes produce their music, the smaller dunes in the dune field remain silent. This indicates that structural properties of the dune are critical for the generation of the singing sand. Also, booming can only be generated at slopes at the angle of repose (30 degrees) on the leeward face of dune; the same sand on the shallower windward side cannot generate the music.",

Perhaps a dystopian world where humans are forced to tunnel into mountains and stay high above the ground to avoid predators below, boxing themselves into an ant-hill like village best explains the wonder. Built over 1,500 years ago, the Maijishan Grottoes are a series of 194 caves carved into the nearly sheer face of a sandstone mountain. High above the frosted lands of Gansu, Maijishan’s face looks like a sponge. Black holes punctuate the rock wall and highlight the massive Buddhist statues carved into the rock. Situated in the far North of China’s modern territory, the caves evolved throughout time, morphing with influence from new cultures and peoples. They continued to change over 12 dynasties, keeping a Buddhist thread throughout its evolution. Although this common theme exists, and the caves feature over 7,000 Buddhist statues, there is significant variation between the statues. Many of the statues, especially those inside the caves are exquisite, and ornately decorated. These more elaborate statues were generally not created with indigenous stone, meaning the rock for these huge ornate statues was hauled up the mountain sides from somewhere else.

56,Yangshuo and Moon Hill,"Guilin, China",Natural arch offers panoramic views of Yangshuo's karst hills.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yangshuo,"Unlike most mountains, the karst hills of Yangshuo poke up randomly as the Li River meanders around their bases. Covered in lush, green vegetation, the natural formations create a dramatic landscape best viewed from Yangshuo’s natural arch, known as Moon Hill. Having drawn visitors with its unique formation for many years, Moon Hill was first climbed by Todd Skinner in the 1990s. Skinner was famous for his free climbing ability, and helped popularize the area with backpackers and hikers visiting China. Although there are climbing routes on Moon Hill, most visitors take the easier path to the summit, or the trail that goes through the arch. Besides Moon Hill, Yangshuo is popular with visitors looking to take cave tours or bike through the magnificent landscape created almost entirely out of karst formations.",Biking to Moon Hill from Yangshuo county is very popular when you on the western street; you can cycle along the head towards the main road from your hotel. This path will lead you down to a large weir where you can cross the river. From here a small path but will take you through Fen Lou Village to the Jin Bao River. Cross the river and take the concrete road turning right when it meets the main road and bike 5 min to Moon Hill. This takes again about 40 minutes and is a very scenic taking you through two villages.
57,Ming Dynasty Tombs,"Beijing, China",Ming Dynasty necropolis raided during the Cultural Revolution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ming-dynasty-tombs,"China’s political situation over the last 70 years could easily be described as manic. Mao Zedong proclaimed his country the People’s Republic of China in 1949, and quickly began a long and troubled relationship with China’s history, that seemed to sway with his moods. Unfortunately for many historical sites like the Dingling tomb, moving out of Mao’s favor meant sanctioned disaster. Built in the 15th century, the Ming Dynasty Necropolis is one of the largest in the world and was chosen specifically at the feet of the Tianshou Mountain for its feng shui. The necropolis holds all of the Ming Emperors until the end of the dynasty in 1644, but many supposed the real gems of the area were hidden beneath the extravagant tombs. In 1956, a group of archeologists proposed a scholarly excavation of the Dingling tomb in preparation for uncovering the secrets of the largest Ming Tomb, the Changling. Given a brief window to explore and uncover the tomb’s treasures and history, the team hurriedly excavated and formed a museum on the site, which held Ming crowns, jewelry and the skeletons of the Wanli Emperor and his wife. The museum and site, although hardly maintained, honored the Ming Dynasty. Only a decade later, the Cultural Revolution was in full swing, and a new fate arrived at the tomb. A group of Red Guards, with full sanction from the state, visited the tombs and began a horrible raid on the Dingling tomb. They destroyed priceless Ming artifacts and pulled out the skeletons of the Wanli Emperor and Empress. Denouncing them as bourgeoisie, the guards proceeded to light the bones on fire in front of a crowd in the necropolis. Today, the government has adopted a new policy because of the excavation debacle and will only excavate a historical site for restoration.","Be aware to do your own research on these places in China as so many GPS coordinated mentioned from the Editors are wrong.

58,Guoliang Tunnel,"Guoliang, China",A tunnel dug through the side of a mountain by hand provides convenient yet death-defying access to a small village in China.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guoliang-tunnel,"The village of Guoliang had a problem. High in the Taihang Mountains of the Henan Province, the only access to civilization were some steep, narrow stairs embedded in the mountainside called the “Sky Ladder”, a treacherous, slippery climb even for the most nimble and sure-footed of the villagers or their rare company callers. For several years, the 350 inhabitants of this isolated location beseeched the government for a roadway to connect them to the outside world, but their pleas fell on deaf ears. Undeterred, they decided that if the officials refused to help them, they would do it themselves. Selling their animals and other necessities for supplies, the people of Guoliang sent down 13 of their strongest workers. The team of men, not an engineer among them, set about carving a roadway inch by inch, using nothing but hand tools, patience, and determination. In 1977, 5 years after beginning their colossal undertaking, the villagers had managed to dig out 0.75 mi. of tunnel, 16 ft. tall and 13 ft. wide. While quite the amazing feat, a do-it-yourself mountain tunnel dug by hand is obviously not the pillar of safety, in fact in many spots of the tunnel, roughly carved pillars are the only thing keeping you from plunging to your death. Several villagers died during construction, and the road itself is only wide enough for the very slow, careful passing of oncoming cars. This is made terrifying by the fact that the road was built on the path of least resistance. The tunnel twists, turns and dips in unpredictable places, enough to leave any driver white-knuckled in terror at what could be coming at them around the slippery blind spot of a bend. Originally intentioned to provide the Guoliang residents with some convenience, the tunnel has become quite the tourist attraction, giving the village a little too much unwanted attention, but some very welcome revenue. There are now hotels and bridges that have been built for hikers and travelers, but access isn’t always granted, so make sure to check the internet for updates on the current visiting status.","The Village of Guoliang is about 120 kilometers or 75 miles north of the city of Zhengzhou in the Wanxianshan Scenic Area. If you want to go there by train, the nearest train station is at Xinxiang at (新乡) that is about 50 miles southeast of the Wanxianshan Scenic Area. From there, you can take buses to the town of Huixian 辉县. Get off at the Huxian Bus Station, and then take another bus to the Wanxianshan Scenic Area. This leg costs about 6 RMB or 1 USD and takes 30 minutes. From there, there are buses that cost 11 RMB that go the the scenic area. This leg takes about two hours though it is only about 40 miles away because the buses make many stops. The bus lets you off at the scenic area at a place where you can hire another ride or hike the 4 kilometers to Guoliangcun or 2.5 kilometers to another village called Nanping."
59,Yungang Grottoes,"Datong, China","Massive series of 45 caves and over 51,000 sculptures carved from cliffsides in China.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yungang-grottoes,"Buddhism came to China along the Silk Road from India in the early 400s. In the Shanxi region of central China, the monk Tan Yao and other Buddhists began carving sculpture-filled caves around the capital city of Pingcheng (now Datong). Between 465 AD and 525, 45 caves, 252 shrines, and 51,000 sculptures were built. The carvings span over one kilometer along the side of the mountain. The walls of the caves are lined with sculptures of Buddha in different positions, though most feature the Sakyamuni, a young Buddha, in a seated position. The sculptures range in size from barely two centimeters to over 17 meters high. Though the carvings are exposed to the elements, they have been preserved by many efforts. The Liao Dynasty from 1049-1060 attempted to correct some erosion. Additionally, after a fire in 1621, the Qing Dynasty rebuilt extensive parts of the sculptures. Lastly, the People’s Republic of China list the grottoes as a key cultural site to be protected by the government. They have stopped illegal construction around the caves and saved many grottoes near collapse. In 2001, the grottoes were made an UNESCO Site of World Heritage.",
60,Tianjin Binhai Library,"Tianjin, China",China’s breathtaking futuristic library is lined floor to ceiling with fake books.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tianjin-binhai-library,"When the Binhai Library opened in the Chinese coastal city of Tianjin in October of 2017, it attracted a flood of visitors and a flurry of social media photos straight away. And no wonder, considering it is absolutely stunning. At first glance, the bright white atrium appears to be covered with row upon swirling row of colorful books stacked on a continuous wave of curving, terraced shelves. That is not altogether true, however. While the library’s modern design is unquestionably beautiful, there is a slight catch: The books lining this literary repository are not actually real. The majority of the “books” in the room are in fact printed images of book spines papered onto the back of the shelving to give the appearance of rows of tomes. If you take a closer look at the stunning photos of the space, it is easy to tell the real books apart from the flat replicas. The building, designed by the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, is an impressive 36,000 square feet and five stories high, with the capacity to fit over a million books in its collection. As of yet, it only stores about 200,000 volumes, housed in the library’s more traditional reading rooms. In fact, the curved continuum of shelves in the main room are actually meant to be used as seating and steps for visitors, giving the feeling you are lost in an undulating sea of words. They surround a huge, gleaming white spherical auditorium that stands at the center of the room. When seen from the park outside the library, the unique space resembles a giant eye, and has already been dubbed “The Eye of Binhai.” Given the masterful, though controversial, optical illusion at play, it seems an appropriate nickname.","The library is part of an ambitious urban cultural center developed by the city of Tianjin. Nearby is the Tianjin Grand Theatre, Art Gallery, Natural History Museum, Science and Technology Museum and other venues."

It has been successfully completed and opened to the public in November 2018 , it is also be one of the most eco-friendly places to stay in China. Built into an abandoned quarry about 20 miles from Shanghai, the hotel includes two underwater floors and a green rooftop that blends into the surrounding countryside. The unique design takes advantage of the location and natural elements such as the rocky cliffs, waterfalls, and surrounding hills. A glass waterfall atrium pours over the façade, where all 14 floors of above the water level rooms have balconies and views of the quarry. The underground floors include under water rooms and a restaurant that face a 33-foot-long aquarium, plus a leisure complex, swimming pool, and water sports. The hotel’s roof is above ground level and is partly covered with grass and trees to fit into the surrounding topography and preserve the local environment. Adjacent to the hotel is a theme park with a glass walkway and observation platform overhanging the quarry cliffs. The luxury resort hotel is not only a dazzling design concept: It was built to prevent further ecological damage to the environment around it and features an extensive sustainability program. The hotel is in fact an example of ‘Passive ‘sustainability, using the micro climate of the quarry and the thermal inertia if the rocky cliffs cooling in the summer and heating in the winter. An engineering marvel, the Shimao Wonderland Intercontinental was designed by British Architect Martin Jochman, initially with the same British firm that designed the stunning Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai  and  later with his own studio JADE+QA. It took 12 years to build partially because novel solutions were needed to transport materials down into the quarry. The chief engineer called it a “fight with gravity” that took more than 5,000 architects, engineers, designers, and workers to build.","The hotel is now open to the public and is extremely popular with visitors. The resort will have 337 guest rooms, a conference centre that can accommodate 1,000, and a series of restaurants and banquet facilities."
62,World Joyland Theme Park,"Changzhou Shi, China",This incredible Chinese theme park may be the largest bootleg in history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-joyland-theme-park,"Chinese knock-offs of popular products and intellectual properties are a common enough occurrence, but World Joyland Theme Park’s appropriation of popular video game imagery takes bootlegging to a whole new level. The park, which was opened in 2011, is a sprawling video game themed attraction in one of China’s busiest cities. The park is split into two distinct sections: half of the park is a fantasy pastiche reminiscent of the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft, and the other half is a science-fiction world, shockingly similar to the strategy game, Starcraft. The fantasy half of the park, known as the “Terrain of Magic,” is full of larger-than-life statues of fantastic characters that are cribbed straight out of the popular game, but with an altered color scheme or other small alteration. Warriors, satyrs, elves, and demons all stand boldly in the face of copyright law. Even the architecture of the castles and orcish huts seem to have been rendered straight from the game world. Most of the rides are genre-themed versions of popular amusement park staples such as the log flume and roller coasters of all stripes. Over in the “Universe of Starship,” visitors can walk among the eerily identical halls of the futuristic buildings which are designed exactly the same as the digital fortresses of Starcraft. The park’s largest ride, a huge, blue roller coaster named the “Sky Scrapper,” is contained within the “Universe” and provides a reasonably futuristic look to the skyline. Similarities to any Blizzard Entertainment (owners of both Starcraft and Warcraft) properties aside, World Joyland is a truly incredible sight with its limitless statues and sincere love for the fantasy worlds it creates. The park also has a fairly laudable mission: to bridge the real lives and the digital lives of its visitors.",
63,798 Art District,"Beijing, China",This probably wasn't what Mao had in mind.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/798-art-district,"When people think about trendy art neighborhoods, Soho is more likely to come to mind than Beijing, but Chinese Contemporary Art could be the next big thing. Works from Chinese artists Ai WeiWei and Wenda Gu are flying off the shelves, and Christie’s and Sotheby’s can’t get enough. Art prices are growing even faster than China’s explosive economy, and the 798 is at the center of this boom. The 798 thrives on irony. Tiny shops sell kitschy Maoist junk, or T-shirts displaying “Obamao.” The greatest irony of all, though, are the buildings itself. The entire complex is built in a Cultural Revolution-era warehouse district, with the Moaist slogans still emblazoned in big red letters in some of the gallery spaces, urging the proletariat to work hard for Mother China. The factories give the area a gritty feel, and the district was actually almost closed by the government in 2003. Mao was a great patron of the arts, but he probably didn’t have this in mind. The actual district is a mixture of galleries, museums, shops, and cafes. It’s large enough that it would be hard to see everything in an afternoon, but it is great for perusing and exploring.

You crossed the slender wooden structure that locals called “Brave Men’s bridge” at your peril. And then the park manager decided to take things up a notch. In 2014, engineers underwent the unenviable task of replacing Brave Men’s wooden slats with glass, allowing visitors to stare directly onto the 590-foot drop. Underneath your now trembling legs are thick panels, 25 times stronger than normal glass. Staring down into the abyss is possibly the scariest part of the crossing, but perhaps not the most impressive. At almost 300 meters (980 feet) across, this was the longest glass suspension bridge in the world for a brief time. It connects two peaks in the rocky terrain of the national park in Hunan Province, the region believed to have inspired the film Avatar. It didn’t hold its title of “world’s longest” for very long. In 2016 a 1,400 foot glass bridge was constructed in the nearby Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon, looming twice as high as Brave Men’s bridge. These Chinese suspension bridges and other shiny attractions such as the Ledge at the Willis Tower in Chicago and the glass skywalk in the Grand Canyon show how glass adds a novel dimension to the world’s wonders.",
65,Shanghai's 1933 Slaughterhouse,"Shanghai, China","Rivers of cattle blood gone, a strange Escheresque building remains, the last of its kind.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/1933-slaughterhouse,"Once one of the largest slaughterhouses in the East, this poured concrete building is a study in a strange Escher-esque beauty. Built in 1933 in pre-Communist Shanghai, the four-story building was designed by British architects and built by Chinese developers with British concrete. Today the building is an eerie Gotham-Deco achievement in concrete, glass, and steel, and the last remaining of its design in the world. Since its retirement as an abattoir the building has served many purposes, from medicine factory and cold storage to “lifestyle center” where Ferrari owners meet. But the building’s unique design emerges from its original purpose: slaughtering cattle. The walls are 50 centimeters thick, and hollow to help control air temperature. Designed for efficiency, the hulking spiderweb of intertwining staircases, ramps, bridges and corridors was all part of guiding the flow both of thousands of workers to their stations, and of millions of cattle to their deaths. Rough floor surfaces prevented cattle from slipping, even on blood-slick floors. The lovely lattice windows on the outside were built to create maximum air circulation. The entire building was built around a central atrium that let in natural light. Cattle were herded through “air bridges” of varying width which controlled the animals’ flow, and the building’s sharp angles allowed small spaces for people to stand in, in case the cattle began to panic. However, despite the utilitarian purpose of the building, much thought was put into its style and decoration. The building is filled with decorative elements, such as beautifully designed Art Deco motifs in many of the windows and “flowering” columns. There is even a religious element to the design. All the windows were built facing west, the direction of the Buddhist holy land. This was thought to help aid the cattle’s process of reincarnation. On a more practical note, it is also the wind direction in Shanghai and helped to counter the smell of slaughter. Ultimately it is the interlocking staircases and twenty-six “air bridges” of varying width that connect the outer areas with the circular core that give the building its mind-bending M.C. Escher quality. If you’re interested in urban exploration, decay, architecture, or are looking for a stunning photo backdrop, 1933 Slaughterhouse is a must-see.","The location is very popular with Shanghai millennials.

Huang, the path leads right into a rock face and out on to Buxian Bridge which spans the chasm between two giant rock faces. While the bridge was built in 1987, it very deliberately looks as though it was built much earlier. The concrete bridge is only a few feet across, but the elaborate design work used on the hand rails give the short span the feel of some ancient Chinese relic built by an ancient dynasty of some sort. The rift often fills with impenetrable clouds of fog that are common to the region (and which actually give the surrounding Xihai Grand Canyon its name, Xihai meaning “West Sea” referring to the foggy oceans of clouds surrounding the peaks). The bridge has earned the nickname the “Fairy Walking Bridge” thanks to the fantastical, otherworldly vibe that the pass has. In fact the entire hiking area is referred to as the “Magic Scenic Area” thanks to the stunning paths alont the cliff sides and other natural features such as a peak known as the “Cloud-Dispelling Pavilion” which tends to punch up through the cloud layer.

On its own, the East Taihang Glasswalk—a 3,800 foot tall glass-bottomed walkway in the towering mountains of eastern China—would be absolutely terrifying. But apparently, for the operators of the glass bridge, these heights are not scary enough: to truly petrify its guests, the bridge’s operators have used an optical illusion to make it appear as if the glass beneath your feet is cracking into pieces. As visitors to the East Taihang Mountains walk across a glass bridge thousands of feet high in the sky, a series of splintering cracks will suddenly begin to appear like a spider web on the floor. There is little that will make your heart pound more than staring down at the mountain valley hundreds of stories beneath your feet, and then discovering that the invisible layer of glass that has sustained your life so far appears to have been shattered. Fortunately for guests to the glasswalk, the bridge has never actually broken. The splintering of the glass is merely a prank, albeit one of the most provocative, high-tech, and absolutely terrifying ones in the world. The effect is accomplished with infrared sensors which track the movement of people walking across the bridge, triggering a dual visual and audio effect to give the impression that the glass walkway is fracturing into pieces. Upon looking at videos taken of the bridge, it’s clear that the breaking glass effect is just an illusion, as the “cracks” disappear after just a few seconds. In the moment, however, the East Taihang bridge may easily provoke the greatest panic attack of your life.",
69,Longyou Caves,"Quzhou , China","Discovered after draining a local pond, these ancient man-made caves are still a complete mystery.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/longyou-caves,"For as long as anyone could remember the ponds of Longyou County were thought of as “bottomless,” but when one local set out to see how deep they really were he discovered the first in a series of massive hand-carved caves, the origin of which is almost a complete mystery. In 1992, in the Chinese village of Longyou, a uniquely curious local named Wu Anai pooled his money with his neighbors to buy a water pump and began siphoning out the pond in his village. The pond was one of many in the area that were used for washing, fishing, and other chores, and which were always said to be endlessly deep. Not satisfied with that fantastical depth, Anai completely drained one pond and found that it wasn’t really a pond at all, but the flooded entrance to an ancient, man-made cave. Soon other ponds in the area were also drained and they too were found to be strangely massive, hand-carved caves (24 in all). The huge caverns sink as deep as almost 100 feet and then sprawl out at the bottom. While none of the caves are connected many of them share thin walls that it is remarkable the primitive builders did not puncture. The walls of the caves are also covered in carved lines and symbols, the meaning of which has yet to be deciphered. And that’s hardly the only mystery. While the caverns have been dated back to around 200 BCE, there is no historical record of their construction, nor is there any evidence of the tools used to make them, or even their purpose. In addition no one is quite sure where the excavated rock went. The caves seem too big to have been the work of a small group villagers and it is thought that it would have taken over a thousand workers to build them in their day. While the origins of the caves are still unknown, they are now open to visitors willing to make the trek to the remote village. Hopefully someone can come back with some answers.",

From above the lake looks like a painter’s palette, with dabbles of magenta, green, and aquamarine across the landscape. Down on the surface, a yearly ritual has taken place for millennia. Workers slowly and painstakingly shovel piles of salt that are left behind as the water evaporates. These hunks of white crystal have helped grant Yuncheng a place of cultural and political esteem, and the chemical reactions catalyze an otherworldly landscape that enchants locals and phone-wielding tourists alike. Known as “China’s Dead Sea” for its salinity, the vast lake has long been the focal point of Yuncheng’s culture and economy. Chinese historians estimate that locals have consciously harvested salt from the lake for 6,000 years, and ancient human remains found in the area suggest that people may have realized the water’s salty benefit even further back. By the sixth century, Yuncheng lake was responsible for a quarter of China’s overall salt production. Local lore reports wars fought over possession of the lake, and nearby temples are dedicated to salt gods. The lake is connected to the signature tang in Shanxi’s food, which is replete with salty soy sauce. Today, most travelers come to the lake not to worship the salt gods, but to marvel at the landscape’s surreal charm. As opposed to the Dead Sea, which is filled with high concentrations of chloride that make it hostile to most forms of life, Yuncheng Lake is filled with sulfate, which supports a lush ecosystem. In the summer, algal blooms turn the water technicolor thanks to Dunaliella salina, an algae species that changes color when it reacts with salt. In winter, when the temperature dips below 23 degrees Fahrenheit, the salt forms crystals of mirabilite, also known as Glouber’s Salt, transforming the landscape into twinkling winter fantasy. Yuncheng salt was traditionally harvested for culinary use, through a five-step process that the Shanxi Province has officially recognized as a piece of the region’s intangible heritage. Since the 1980s, however, producers have abandoned this process and pivoted toward industrial harvesting. Locals hope that the influx of visitors interested in marveling at the lake can also help inspire the preservation of local salt harvesting traditions, and of the rich ecosystem that has given rise to an extraordinary natural beauty.",There are several buses that run from downtown Yuncheng to the lake. Other salt lakes in China have suffered extreme pollution due to tourist attention. Help keep Yuncheng from the same fate by carrying your trash out with you.
72,Fanjingshan (Mount Fanjing),"Tongren, China",Two ancient Buddhist temples crown this dramatic rocky pinnacle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fanjingshan,"On its own, Fanjingshan (Mount Fanjing) is a jaw-dropping pinnacle stretching hundreds of feet above the valley floor. But if you look closely, you’ll see the mountain is not merely a natural wonder—it’s also steeped in Buddhist history, and features a pair of ancient Chinese temples atop its peak. Located in the eastern Guizhou province of China, Fanjingshan is the highest peak of the Wuling Mountains, stretching 8,430 feet above sea level. Draped in dense forests filled with fir trees and Guizhou golden monkeys, it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2018. Like Avatar Hallelujah Mountain, Fanjingshan is much taller than it is wide, a vertical pinnacle that resembles a pencil standing on a desk. To reach the top, visitors have to walk up more than 8,000 steps or  take a cable car ride up from the road below. The two temples atop the mountain were each constructed on separate peaks, and guests must cross a small bridge to traverse the crevice between them. There are few more dramatic ways to reach a historic Buddhist temple than by crossing a mountain bridge in the clouds. Many Buddhists believe Fanjingshan to be the bodhimaṇḍa (place of enlightenment) of Maitreya, the “future Buddha.” According to Buddhist tradition, Maitreya will return to earth in the future to help others reach enlightenment. It’s unknown exactly when Fanjingshan was first constructed. Buddhism first came to the region in 639 during the Tang Dynasty, and the temples were likely constructed sometime after that. The temples were partially destroyed in the late 1500s during the Bozhou Rebellion, when members of the Miao ethnic group rose up against the Ming Dynasty and looted various sacred sites, but they have since been restored. After centuries of history, Fanjingshan stands today as one of the most dramatically-placed temples in China, a monument to Buddhism that will leave you breathless—especially if you make the 8,000 step ascent there.","Fanjingshan can be reached from the Chinese city of Tongren via a train or bus ride, or, for the less frugal, a two hour taxi ride."

The park also contains a shrunken Manhattan, where the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers still dominate the New York skyline.  Unfortunately, the park is not well maintained and time is taking its toll on many of the monuments. In China, red tape and government restrictions make international travel difficult at best; but television and the internet are introducing a rapidly growing population to the allure of global culture.

You get your ghostly tongue sawed off in the afterlife by a finely muscled red boar demon, that’s what. Beijing’s Dongyue Temple is like the DMV of Daoist hells, an Asian Dante’s Inferno, a strip mall of underworld bureaucracy where justice is, at long last, served. Enclaves around the edges of the temple hold statues representing the 76 departments of the supernatural kingdom, including, you’ll be pleased to note, “The Department of Controlling Theft and Robbery,” the “Department of Distribution of Medication, the “Department of Paying Back Evil with Evil,” and the ever-popular “Unjust Death Department.” Appeals for posthumous vengeance or absolution can be made via a donation box at the mouth of each enclave, so if you’ve got a lot of beefs to rectify, bring a stack of small change. Construction started on the building in 1319, with the last round of post-Cultural Revolution renovations in 2002.

The historic observatory was originally built in 1442 during the Ming Dynasty, but was actually the evolution of an older, smaller observatory established in 1227. The eight original instruments for star-gazing were installed during the Ming Dynasty’s stewardship, but were stolen and returned a number of times over the years, both by invading countries and by changing political regimes. However the ancient steel instruments have always made their way back to the observatory. The ancient instruments include large versions of standard cartography tools such as an ornate sextant, and more exotic instruments such as the azimuth theodolite and the armillary sphere, both of which were used to measure stellar distances as best as they could given the technology. Much of the science behind the tools was based on a mix of Western and Eastern teachings, but all of the ancient instruments feature extensive Asian flourishes in the metalwork such as dragons, lions, and floral swirls. All of the tools at the Beijing Ancient Observatory are located outdoors on the top of an ancient building that was once known as the “Platform of Star-Watching.” The building itself is now part of the Beijing Planetarium and houses a museum dedicated to Chinese astronomy and any visitors to the site can not only see the stars, but through time itself.",

As the water runs over these flat platforms, it forms dozens of miniature whitewater waterfalls, cascading down the mountain valley. Like the Pamukkale Water Terraces in Turkey, the river flows down the flat circular terraces like giant steps on a staircase or cakes stacked upon one another. Local legends of the Nakhi people claim the water in Blue Moon Valley gets its blue pigmentation from the raft that the gods took to the valley. In actuality, the river, which originates from the melting snow of the Himalayas above, gets its turquoise tint from copper ions in the water. While the terraces in Blue Moon Valley are mostly natural, the Chinese government has done several artificial interventions to make them look even more spectacular. It’s surely worked; the terraces, combined with the flowers, gorges, and meadows that surround them, make Blue Moon Valley one of the most scenic spots in all of China.",

Of the over 200,000 piece collection, only around 5,600 pieces are on permanent display, with the rest being stored out of sight of visitors. These viewable pieces are displayed in a six-story building which is modern in design, but ancient in architectural origin.  An overhanging roof imitates the imperial Chinese architectural style, a decorative Ming Dynasty-era arch is embedded into the entrance hall, and stones used in the floor construction were even quarried in the town of Fangshan, an ancient supplier of building material.  The first five floors are composed of a rectangular and oval hall, each showcasing different works of archeology and art.  The sixth floor contains only the oval gallery, which is raised above the museum’s wide, flat roof. The Beijing Capital Museum celebrates the long arc of Chinese and East Asian history, with an emphasis on the region’s rich, artful culture.

The park features dozens of full scale dinosaur models as well as bones, both real and fake. There are also lots of photo opportunities with dinosaurs smashing down walls and hatching from eggs. However, Dinosaur Fairyland is never crowded, probably due to its remote location, about 20km outside the town of Erlian in Inner Mongolia, China. However, this means you will have the park all to yourself, except for the occasional men in military uniform that use the park as a thoroughfare to the bus station. From the top of a nearby hill, you can see the words Dinosaurs Fairyland written in giant letters, in the same style as the iconic Hollywood sign, spelled out across the ground in both English and Mandarin.

At least as comforting as two dinosaurs engaged in a French kiss can ever really be to a weary traveler on the Trans-Mongolian Express. Guarding the small town of Erlian, also known as Erenhot, are two massive apatosauruses, with necks craned and tongues lashing against each other. According to most estimates, they are the largest dinosaurs in the world, and their romantic activities add to their strangeness. Although they are the most prominent creatures in the Chinese Jurassic Park, the highways, parks and sidewalks are dotted with statues of prehistoric lizards. The wild Inner-Mongolian statuary stem from a series of fossil discoveries through much of the last 50 years discovered near the area. Just a few kilometers out of town, one salt lake in particular housed hundreds of bones itself. Since that time, the Chinese have worked to cultivate tourism around the town, and have placed the hopes of every resident of the barren town on the allure of a Mongolian dinosaur fantasy-land.

The now-popular cave is named after the copious amounts of reeds that grow at the entrance to the site which are often collected to makes flutes and other small wind instruments; however it was not this harvest that led to the discovery of the cave. It was actually discovered in modern times by a group of refugees who took refuge in the cave while fleeing Japanese forces during World War II. However later explorers of the cave discovered ink writings on the stone that dated back to 792 CE, during the time of the Tang dynasty, proving that pilgrimages to the cave are nothing new. The interior of the cave is a veritable show gallery of gorgeous geological formations. Created by millennia of water erosion on the soft limestone, the cave features stalactites, stalagmites, and tall columns of stone reaching from floor to ceiling. The walls also consist of rippling, eroded patterns which have dripped into the rock over centuries. Today the Reed Flute Cave is dramatically lit by countless, multi-colored lights hidden in the cracks and crevices of the space. The effect is almost surreal as the lights turn the otherwise dark space into a strange mix of bright neon colors and rough natural erratics.

This centuries-old tradition stems from trying to avoid fear. Many believed it was easier to climb to the peak if the ground was hardly visible in the darkness of night. Although Huashan takes no climbing expertise to ascend, it is considered the most dangerous hike in the world. To reach the North Peak, stone steps have been carved from the mountain at an impossibly steep incline. Although technically a set of steep stairs, the way up the peak is more akin to a ladder, requiring a slow and deliberate climb. On both sides of the treacherous steps are chains, which are the only safety precaution available to climbers.but the road is wide,your safety can be ensured. While the climb to the North Peak is only meant for the boldest visitors, the most dangerous hike available on Huashan is a horizontal climb from the North to the South Peak. The trek actually follows a narrow wooden outcropping next to the cliff face, barely wide enough to accommodate two feet in hiking boots. Once again, only a chain stands between the climber and a mile-high drop off. Over the years, the trek between peaks has claimed the lives of many visitors, causing Chinese authorities to work to improve safety on the peaks. Despite the dangers, people have been climbing to the North Peak for over 2000 years, and Huashan is regarded as one of the most sacred Taoist mountains in China. It is believed that spirits and a god live on the mountain and on many parts of the mountain, there are small Taoist shrines and temples frequented by pilgrims and hermits. The dangers of hiking Huashan are very real, and visitors should take precaution when climbing.

It certainly looks the part. And at 15 to 25 feet deep, the lake is suspiciously deep considering its isolated location in the middle of a sun-scorched desert. This was only exacerbated by the fact that, once the local government noticed the lake was losing its total surface area, steps were taken to ensure the water supply didn’t dry up. But the move wasn’t about ecology so much as tourism, since Crescent Lake is a popular tourist destination in all seasons.

Built during the Eastern Han Dynasty which lasted from around 25 to 200 CE, the regal city of Shi Cheng, which loosely translates to “Lion City,” was named after the Wu Shi Mountain which rose behind it and which itself translates to “Five Lion Mountain.” Unfortunately in 1959, the valley in which the ancient city of Shi Cheng was located was flooded in order to create the man-made Qiandao Lake, which in turn would power a hydroelectric plant. While this hid the city from view under, at some points over a hundred feet of water, it also had the unintended net positive of preserving the ancient architecture from the ravages of the far more damaging wind and sun. To this day there are almost 300 arches still standing beneath the waves in addition to a great number of intact buildings.

The glass wind tunnel in the center of the amphitheater is powered by massive air flow engines, which allows the Shaolin monks to hover in the air in perfect levitation. The stage’s perforated surface quiets the engine room’s roar, enabling the monks to float atop the wind tunnel in absolute tranquility. The Shaolin Flying Monks Theatre sits atop Shaolin Monastery’s Cypress Hill. The futuristic, 230-seat Colosseum was designed by the bold Latvian architectural firm Mailitis Architects and symbolizes “mountain and tree,” portrayed by the theater’s protruding facade and its mushroom-like glass levitation chamber, respectively.

The Western Han Dynasty Terracotta Warriors Museum features hundreds of these statues and displays them in various stages of discovery and restoration. You’ll walk past glass-enclosed pits still in the process of being excavated, as well as displays of fully restored pieces. Similar to in Xi’an, in addition to the soldier statues, excavations have revealed terracotta horses, miniature armor, and assorted infantry gear.

Originating mostly from the Tang Dynasty dating back nearly to 500 CE, the creation of the grottoes was started thanks to an emperor’s expansion of his empire. Wanting to create a new monumental work for the ages a large temple was carved directly out of the limestone cliff face featuring a group of large Buddha figures. Slowly, the temple began expanding with artisans building not further into the rock face, but rather creating small new niches adjacent to the central temple. Over the next 500 years, over a thousand new spaces were dug out of the rock, each acting as its own little temple. Nearly 100,000 statues were created in the ever-expanding series of little caves. Generals, wealthy nobles, and other powerful figures from the time would commission new niches regularly. Unfortunately, many of the grottoes were looted and vandalized in the ensuing centuries, however, thousands of niches still exist on either side of the river. The central grotto still features a number of tall Buddha statues and is now a fenced-off attraction and a protected UNESCO site.

Known as Yelang Valley, the massive collection of art spans over two million square feet and includes castles, lakes, and freestanding towers adorned with facial features. Local masons helped with the construction, though since they had little artistic experience, Peilun instructed them to treat building the structures as if they were making pigpens. Peilun began building Yelang Valley after visiting the Crazy Horse Memorial on a trip to the United States. He quit his job as a professor and purchased a then-isolated plot of land. The artist chose to build the mystical-looking sculpture park out of stone, as it was abundantly available and would therefore be environmentally friendly and cheap. Yelang Valley is his way of honoring and remembering the Yelang tribes that inhabited the area nearly 2,000 years ago before disappearing and leaving few artifacts in their wake.

But it’s an undeniably impressive feat of engineering and, at 1,070 feet tall, it holds the record for the world’s tallest outdoor lift. The Zhangjiajie National Forest Park in the Hunan Province of China is famous for the spectacular sandstone pillars that rise up from the forest floor, the tallest reaching heights of more than 3,000 feet. Think of the floating Hallelujah Mountains in Avatar, and you’ll have a fairly good mental image. Among these pillars rises another lofty structure, albeit one of steel and glass: the Bailong Elevator (meaning the Hundred Dragons Elevator), officially recognized as the tallest outdoor lift in the world. Construction began in 1999 and, after an investment of about $20 million, the Bailong Elevator opened to the public in 2002. The elevator was built into a carefully selected quartz sandstone cliff face, into which tunnels and shafts were dug to accommodate the three glass-faced double-deck elevators. The lift has a total height of 1,070 feet (326 meters), of which the lower 505 feet are embedded inside the mountain wall, with the upper 565 feet consisting of exposed steel derrick. The three elevators run in parallel, offering dizzying views of the sandstone pillars and surrounding mountains and forest. Following a speed upgrade in 2015, the cars now make the ascent in just one minute and 32 seconds. And, incidentally, it takes 68 minutes and 26 seconds to free-climb the upper exposed section of the elevator, but only if you’re crazy and French. Each elevator has a carrying capacity of 4,900 kilograms, with 50 passengers traveling in each car. All of which means that the Bailong Elevator is not only the world’s tallest outdoor elevator, but also the world’s tallest double-deck sightseeing elevator and the world’s fastest passenger traffic elevator with the biggest carrying capacity. Though indeed impressive, the elevator has stirred up a few controversies. It was shut for 10 months during 2002 and 2003 to address safety concerns, which in an earthquake-prone area were especially pressing (the lift cars are all now fitted with earthquake detectors to allow a quick evacuation in case of a quake). Even more controversial was the idea of building a massive steel elevator in a UNESCO World Heritage Site and protected national park. Apart from all the construction concerns, environmentalists also argued that it would draw even more tourists to an already popular site, putting further pressure on the park and its infrastructure. The elevator’s supporters have countered this claim with a fairly reasonable argument of their own: the elevator has greatly reduced the damage to mountain trails, as tourists can now bypass them altogether by taking the lift. Furthermore, they argue, visitors can now come to the park as a day trip thanks to the greatly reduced travel time. Previously, tourists had to drive for more than three hours along what was at times a dangerous mountain road to access different parts of the park. Now, they just have to queue up for a one-and-a-half minute elevator ride. With tourists no longer needing to stay overnight, many hotels and guesthouses have been removed, further reducing the environmental impact of tourism in the park.","The Bailong Elevator is located in the Zhangjiajie National Forest Park in Zhangjiajie in the Hunan Province of China. The park is one of several inside the Wulingyuan Scenic Area. Buses from the main bus station in Zhangjiajie City take 45 to 60 minutes to reach Wulingyuan; there are also shuttle buses from the airport. Once inside the park there are four bus routes, two of which stop at the elevator. Elevator tickets cost CNY 72 (about $10.50 US) each way."
97,Shanghai French Concession,"Shanghai, China","An out-of-place slice of France, smack in the middle of Shanghai.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shanghai-french-concession,"While this Shanghai neighborhood no longer has any official French ownership, the area is still ruled by a laid-back attitude and European architecture. Located in the northeastern portion of the modern day Xuhui District of Shanghai, the former Shanghai French Concession was a region under French control from 1849 until its return to the hands of the Chinese government in 1946. Although the Old French Concession is now one of the most vibrant shopping districts in Shanghai (including the massive Xujiahui complex), the wrought iron fences, tree-lined boulevards, hidden cafés, and vibrant architecture have allowed the region to maintain a distinctly European flair that harkens back to its days as a French-controlled enclave. Visitors are encouraged to explore the many winding streets on foot to take in the unique combination of Chinese and European culture. To witness some traditional Chinese tai chi or Chinese opera, head over to the sprawling Fuxing Park. Or if ancient temples are more your thing, a visit to the Longhua Temple might be in order. Indeed, with the original construction dating to 247 CE, Longhua is one of the oldest temples in Shanghai. Conversely, the area was also the hub for Catholicism during much of its French ownership and some of the gothic churches remain in the area. Not surprisingly, the former Shanghai French Concession also offers its share of historical attractions. The region served as home to some of the most militantly anti-imperialist Chinese, a fact that may seem somewhat counterintuitive, at least initially. However, it is important to note that the foreign rule of the concession made the region more attractive to radical thinkers than areas under Chinese law. Indeed, the Communist Party had its first national meeting here, while the region also served as home to many prominent political figures.","The Metro Line 1 runs along Huahai and Hengshan Roads, with stops at S. Huangpi Road, S. Shaanxi Road, Hengshan Road, and Xujiahui. The Metro Line 10 runs west from Laoximen with stops at Xintiandi, S. Shaanxi Road, Shanghai Library, and Jiatong Unviersity. The Metro Line 9 services the southern end of the French Concession, stopping at Dapuqiao, Zhaojiabang Road, and Xujiahui."
98,Giant Head of Mao Zedong,"Changsha, China",The world's largest statue of Mao Zedong looks out over the city where he discovered Communism.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mao-mt-rushmore,"Mao Zedong took an active interest in radical politics from an early age. Many of his first forays into Communist thinking began in the south-central Chinese city of Changsha, where he is now honored with a massive granite version of his head. Unlike most representations of China’s Great Leader, the 105-foot-tall sculpture built on Changsha’s river-bound Orange Island remembers the controversial figure as a man in the full blush of youth. With stone hair looking as though it is playing in the wind, and the smooth features of a dashing rogue, the bust, built in 2007, is based on Mao’s look circa 1925. This differs from the usual portrayal of an elder statesman, or “helmsman” of the country. The statue stands out not just for its size, but also its bold presentation. This being the case, the piece was not without its critics. Given the estimated cost of 300 million US dollars, many people found the tribute wasteful. However, Changsha’s pride in Mao’s history with the city was so great as to overcome any objections. No matter how one feels about the great leader, or Communism in general, Changsha’s towering piece of hero worship is an impressive sight and an indelible reminder of the man’s continuing influence in Chinese culture.",
99,Mogao Caves,"Jiuquan, China",Hundreds of caves filled with thousands of centuries-old statues and murals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mogao-caves,"Tucked away in a disused section of the Silk Road on the edge of the Gobi Desert, this place managed to stay under the radar for centuries. Along a one-mile long trail of cliffs beside the Dachuan River are the Mogao Caves, a complex of human-made caves and cells that preserve Buddhist statues and paintings spanning a whole millennium, from the fourth to the 14th centuries. A total of 492 of these caves have survived the test of time. The caves house more than 2,000 statues and more than 480,000 square feet of murals, all created by monks. A keen eye will notice a fusion of different artistic influences, with hints of Roman, Indian, Persian, Turkic, Mongolian, and Tibetan traditions behind the more prominent Han Chinese style. Each and every cave has its own artistic merits, but taken as a whole, they showcase the evolution of Buddhist art in the region. Many murals go beyond the religious theme and incorporate more mundane scenes, with valuable information about the political, economic, and cultural context of the time. Among the worldlier depictions are a camel pulling a cart and farmers at work. Although the murals are in the caves, they were not painted on naked rock. The surface was covered with mud, straw, and reeds, which were commonly used for construction, and an additional layer of lime. The statues, on the other hand, are made of wood, straw, reeds and plaster. These are all easily perishable materials, and they likely survived due to the caves’ remoteness. Part of this complex of caves and cells is also a library (Cave 17) that in addition to Chinese texts, also houses Tibetan, Turkic, and Hebrew documents. Unfortunately, most of the 50,000 documents found in the library were readily sold to foreign (mostly Western) hands. The most valuable of these was the Diamond Sutra, one of the oldest printed books in existence (now at the British Library in London).",The Mugao Caves are a fast taxi ride from the center of Dunhuang.
100,Heicheng Ruins,"Alxa, China",Sited in an Inner Mongolian desert are the remnants of an important trade stop along the Silk Road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/heicheng-ruins,"Some 20 arid miles away from the town of Dalaihubu, the Heicheng Ruins are what’s left of a fortified city positioned along the former Silk Road. Heicheng (also referred to as Khara-Khoto) was an important stop along the Gansu Corridor, a vital trade route that ran from northern China to Central Asia. The city’s walls date back to the year 1032, and constituted the largest fortress along the ancient trade route that connected the Eastern and Western worlds. Heicheng, which was built during the Tangut Empire (1038 to 1227), was a relatively small area that spanned just over 5,000 feet from east to west and some 4,000  feet from north to south. The city was contained by five 40-foot adobe pagodas and almost 33-foot walls, which can still be seen today. Heicheng was captured by Genghis Khan in 1226, after which the city continued to thrive and expanded three-fold in size under Mongol rule. Records indicate that Heicheng expanded even further during the Yuan Dynasty, which lasted from 1271 until 1368. It was during this time that the Italian explorer Marco Polo visited the city and wrote of its culture and remoteness in The Travels of Marco Polo. Shortly after the Yuan Dynasty ended, the city was surrendered to the successive Ming Dynasty and subsequently abandoned. Today, the Heicheng Ruins are a treasured relic of deep regional history. Archaeological digs conducted in the early 20th century unearthed a number of artifacts from what was the city center, including Jioazi, regarded by historians as the first paper form of currency, over 2,000 Tangut manuscripts, and wood engravings. A major excavation carried out by the Russian explorer Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov yielded a collection of 3,500 objects from the site. A selection of Chinese and Tibetan Buddhist paintings on silk, batik fabrics, and a small painting on mud are housed in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, while the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow obtained the preserved books, manuscripts, and dictionaries.","Visitors can reach the Heicheng Ruins by way of a shuttle bus that also stops at the entrance to the nearby dead forest of Guai Shu Lin. The ruins are located about 9 miles east by southeast from this site. The city is about a 15 minute walk through desert terrain from where the bus stops, so it’s recommended that visitors take measures to protect themselves from the direct sun, heat, and sand. Wooden pathways through the desert guide visitors in and out of the city for greater ease."
101,The Fushan Tunnels,"Qingdao, China",Forgotten German bunkers in China create a sharp cultural contrast.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-fushan-tunnels-qingdao-china,"The Fushan Tunnels are a series of military installations and defensive positions, blasted deep beneath the surface of China’s Mount Fu (Chinese: ‘FuShan’). FuShan looks down on the port city of Qingdao, once settled as an Asian outpost by German colonists. The Germans arrived here in 1898, bringing with them a wealth of culture which is still apparent today. St. Michael’s Cathedral in the Bavarian Quarter – along with a series of colonial mansions – stands out in sharp contrast against the surrounding Chinese architecture. Then there’s the Tsingtao Brewery, which uses German-inherited techniques to brew what is arguably the finest beer in China. These colonists also left behind a series of subterranean fortifications, most of which look out over the East China Sea; presumably to warn of attack from the British fleet stationed at Hong Kong. At least three different tunnel networks were built, varying in size, complexity and facilities. Some sections consist of bare rock passages leading into look-out points or gun turrets; other portions of the labyrinth are fitted with reinforced bulkhead doors, electric light and rudimentary air-conditioning. The Germans abandoned Qingdao in 1914 (following the Siege of Tsingtao), being called home to mounting tensions in Europe. The city, along with its tunnels, fell under Japanese Imperial rule until 1922. Each successive occupation of Qingdao left its mark on the Fushan Tunnels, with extensions, additional entrances and increasingly modernised amenities being added at each change of hands. During WWII the tunnels were supposedly used as an artillery depot and special-forces training ground; a role which was to be resumed later, during the period of Mao’s Cultural Revolution between 1966 and ‘76. Since then the tunnels have been abandoned. As many as a dozen different entrances lie scattered around the peak of FuShan, many now hidden beneath rocks and undergrowth. A similar network – not far from the centre of Qingdao – has been memorialised as the ‘Mount Qingdao Fort Museum’. The Fushan Tunnels, however, remain largely unknown.

It also contains a magnificent artistic treasure. A nearly 2,000-foot-long thangka (a religious Buddhist painting) wraps around the interior walls of its second floor. The painting is one of the longest thangkas in the world. More than 400 Tibetan artists spent almost 30 years finishing the masterpiece. Thangkas (also spelled tangkhas) are usually kept rolled up, but this one is stretched for all to see. The colorful blend of religious figures and events creates a visually stunning tapestry of Buddhist knowledge. It’s divided into a continuous and contiguous set of scenes blending one into the other. The thangka shows the entire Tibetan history, the history of Tibetan Buddhism, and famous Buddhist monks, temples, and events. It also depicts the creation of the world, astronomy, technology, science, medicine, architecture, linguistics, and poetry. You’ll also find scenes showing the creation of humankind, with organisms crawling out of the oceans and evolving into human beings. Another segment portrays a contemporary lama that travelled to the United States, which includes images of an airplane and the American flag. The absence of the current Dalai Lama is also notable.",

These structures are unique to China and are characterized by their deep red hues, steep cliffs, and distinctive shapes. Mount Danxia of China’s Guangdong Province is home to some of the bigger (ahem) Danxia Landform attractions. Of particular interest is a natural pillar known as Yangyuanshi, or Male Stone, for reasons that are immediately obvious (see photos). Not far from Yangyuanshi is its female counterpart, Yinyuanshi, effectively reenforcing the conviction that Mother Nature has a sense of humor, and possibly a rather juvenile one at that.",

In 1977, the Chinese government flooded the valley to create the Panjiakou Reservoir. Prior to the flooding, the village was evacuated and the buildings all destroyed but The Wall and a tower still remain. The villagers were moved up the mountainsides and are now fish farmers. One family, whose ancestral home lay at the bottom of the dam, now runs a floating restaurant and a small hotel at the spot where the Wall plunges into the lake. It is a technical dive, not suitable for beginners. The water depth changes throughout and the dive is at the edge of “recreational” diving: 30 meters deep plus or minus. The wall lies under five meters of silt and is cloaked in absolute blackness and cold. However, divers are rewarded with a tower of multiple rooms to swim through and to experience this iconic structure in a very different way.","From Xichengyu Village, you need to take a boat to the dive site.

105,Shanghai Marriage Market,"Shanghai, China","A son-and-daughter meat market, hawked by mom and dad.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shanghai-marriage-market,"Residents of China’s largest city face a conundrum in finding love and marriage. An increase in the busy schedules of young adults, a discrepancy between male and female populations created by China’s one-child policy, and the social pressure to marry before one is thirty puts a tricky timestamp on young Shanghainese. Many of them just don’t have time to deal with it. But their parents do. Started in 1996, Shanghai’s so-called Marriage Market allows parents to advertise their lovelorn children in low-tech, ink-and-paper dating profiles. Posting their children’s educational statistics, work history, age and other demographics, parents try to match their children with partners worthy of them. Of course, parents are picky in choosing mates for their children, who are certainly imbued with supernatural greatness. As a result, parents often post too-demanding achievements, including exorbitant earnings, and exceptional good looks. Needless to say, not everybody finds dates. The Marriage Market hearkens back to a more traditional time when parents arranged their children’s marriages. At the Market, like in traditional Chinese dating cultures, parents often meet each other before the dating couple does. In quickly modernizing China, traditions are often discarded. Nothing is more indicative of this trend than the younger generation’s views about marriage. Children are often uncomfortable with their parents meddling in their love affairs, but they usually don’t need to worry about their parents’ success. Although the market has become hugely popular–drawing more than 1000 people each weekend day– most parents have to return, month after month, year after year. These parents’ concerns aren’t without merit, however. In a society where singleness after thirty is hugely stigmatized, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that more than 24 million Chinese men will be single in 2020. Perhaps the Marriage Market gives moms and pops some agency in saving their sons–and in a few cases, daughters– from this fate.",

Currently home to up to 30 Buddhist monks and nuns in residence, Rongbuk was established in 1909 by Ngawang Tenzin Norbu in its present location. Long known for having meditation huts and caves used by a community of hermetic Buddhist monks and nuns, the monastery is noteworthy for its sprawling grounds containing a main hall with statues of the Buddhist deities Sakyamuni and Padmasambhava, intricate murals, and a prominent chorten containing a reliquary. The first half of the 20th century found Rongbuk booming on religious as well as mountaineering fronts. Once rumored to house 500 devout followers, the monastery gradually expanded to include seven chapels. A modest guesthouse was also added adjacent to the monk and nuns’ quarters for those making briefer spiritual pilgrimages. This addition laid the groundwork for accommodating the ever-increasing number of adventurers drawn to Rongbuk by the tantalizing mountain peaks in its backyard, which continues to this day. Lodging specifications at the monastery’s guesthouse won’t surprise anyone considering it’s being run by reclusive monks at one of the most remote locations in the world. Shared outdoor latrines, tiny rooms, limited heating, and minimal electricity are realities, though most seeking a stay at Rongbuk are doing so for its vantage into the natural and metaphysical, not the tangible.",Accessible by road via a two- to three-hour drive from the Friendship Highway by way of either Shelkar or Old Tingri.

108,The Fox Tower at Dongbianmen,"Beijing, China",This historic Chinese tower was said to have been haunted by fox spirits but is now haunted by a grisly murder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-fox-tower-at-dongbianmen-beijing-china,"The Fox Tower in Beijing, China has been said to be haunted from pretty much the moment it was founded in 1564. Initially the tower was said to be inhabited by deadly fox spirits, but by the 20th century the historic fortification was haunted by the very real specter of a grim murder. Built by meanie isolationist emperor Jiajing, a man so cruel his own concubines tried to strangle him en masse, Dongbianmen’s probably seen more than one murder. It’s one of the few fortifications that survived the dismantling of the old city walls that began after the dynasties bit the dust in 1911. In the dead of winter in 1937, the badly mutilated body of 19-year-old Pamela Werner was found at the base of the Fox Tower at Dongbianmen. The pretty British national, daughter of sinologist ETC Werner, had been raped and dismembered. Detectives took a good stab at solving her murder before Japanese forces rolled into Beijing, but investigators met with a slew of eyebrow-raising bureaucratic hurdles, no arrests were made, and the smaller tragedy was forgotten in the larger atrocities of war. Nearly 80 years later, historian Paul French dropped his 2011 book, Midnight in Peking, which retraces Pamela’s steps in the days and minutes leading up to her death, a path morbid tourists and creeps can follow via the official Midnight in Peking audio walking tour. Dongbianmen is just one of several morbid stops on the audio walk. Pamela’s house - now a print shop - still stands nearby, the alleyway where she ate her last meal is a 10-minute jaunt away, and the old brothel district she took pains to avoid after dark is now a residential street. These days, the Fox Tower is the site of Red Gate Gallery, a contemporary Chinese art space which includes a historical section with vintage photos of Dongbianmen’s semi-recent past.","Dongbianmen is located just inside Beijing's Second Ring Road, and is its own address. The large landmark is located on a low hill and is visible from nearby. Best to give a taxi driver the Chinese name and be dropped off at the gate: 东便门"
109,Unit 731 Museum,"Harbin, China","An impactful museum ensures notorious war crimes disguised as ""medical experimentation"" won't soon be forgotten.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/unit-731-museum,"Unit 731 was a covert biological and chemical warfare research and development wing of the Imperial Japanese Army that undertook lethal human experimentation during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) and World War II. Commanded by General Shiro Ishii, an officer in the Kwantung Army, the exact number of men, women, and children who died within its walls remain unknown, but conservative estimates place it around the several thousand mark. In the decades since, what has come to be understood is that every single one of Unit 731’s prisoners of war – the vast majority of whom were Chinese – died while being held at this camp in Pingfang, just outside the city of Harbin. Almost all these deaths were in horrific fashion. Prisoners were alternately infected or bombarded with the plague, anthrax, and other highly infectious diseases. They were then vivisected without anesthetic so that military scientists could explore the efficacy of their new weapons of biological warfare, all of which seen to have been explicitly designed to be in violation of the Geneva Convention. Unit 731’s ugliness was long-lasting and global in scope. Many of the scientists involved in Unit 731 went on to prominent careers in post-war politics, academia, business, and medicine, while documents show the United States Army helped keep the matter of this human experimentation quiet in exchange for being let in on the “data” Japan’s scientists collected. Today, a museum inside the remnants of Unit 731 exists to memorialize the loss of life and humanity that took place within its walls. Visitors to the museum follow a strategic path that winds among bungalows, the guards’ building, and sheds once used for breeding rats as they follow the development of Japan’s chemical warfare program from the beginning to its most heart-wrenching conclusions. The tour’s major stops consist of a major crime exhibition hall and a handful of sites scattered among various buildings across the former military encampment. Room Nine’s medical instruments display is downright chilling due to the array of test tubes, needles, saws, and coat rack vivisection hooks used to hang “human viscera.” Along the edge of a weed-strewn field out back, a smokestack remains from a large incinerator once used to burn the deceased. The most moving aspect of the museum is within the crime exhibition hall, where the walls are lined with hundreds of moving photos and firsthand testimonies of those brave guards who first broke their long-held silence. Many of these same individuals broke rank years after the war in order to provide crucial information that brought to light the atrocities committed by Unit 731. This very human portrayal of a time and place creates an experience that stirs the depths of its viewer’s soul and returns it to the surface, right where it belongs.","Located about an hour from the centre of Harbin, take bus no 338 or 343 (fare costs ¥2.50) from the western part of the train station, at Kunlun Hotel to Xinjiang Dajie, where it is a ten minute walk from the stop. Taxi from central Harbin to the museum costs around ¥100. Take metro line 1 to Xinjiang Street (southernmost stop). Take exit 2, turn back on yourself and then turn left. The museum is a five-minute walk."
