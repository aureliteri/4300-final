0,Mangyongdae Funfair,"Pyongyang, North Korea",This abandoned-looking amusement park is frighteningly open for business.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mangyongdae-funfair,"The Mangyongdae Funfair is an amusement park in Mangyongdae-guyok. And though crowds are sparse, it refuses to close its doors. Most of the rides in this rickety operation seem to be falling apart at the seams, though the roller coaster, merry-go-round, and train ride are functional. Local farmers regularly test the rides. Allegedly, when foreign journalists visit the park, they are commonly kept on a bus until local residents can be rounded up to make the place look at least a little bit livelier. It’s also said that these foreign visitors are allowed to go on the rides first, for publicity purposes. While the local-tested rides are bundles of fun, it’s not all rusty carousels and roller coasters. You can also enjoy some good, old-fashioned amusement park fun at the shooting gallery, where everyone gets the chance to enjoy taking aim at some imperialist aggressors. Kim Jong-un inspected the park in 2011, and needless to say, Supreme Commander was not pleased. He ordered the park to be cleaned up and brought to the standards of the Songun era, with the “Military First” ideology that officials serve the people. No word on any improvements being made just yet.",
1,Ryugyong Hotel,"Pyongyang, North Korea","North Korea's massive ""hotel of doom.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ryugyong-hotel,"This 300-meter-high skyscraper would be an imposing presence in any city’s skyline. In Pyongyang, North Korea it dwarfs every other structure in sight, dominating not only the skyline but the city itself. It is North Korea’s largest building, and yet it remains for the moment, unfinished. In 1986, a South Korean Group completed the construction of the 226-meter-tall Westin Stamford Hotel in Singapore, at the time the most ambitious construction project ever undertaken by a Korean company. The communist leadership of the North wanted to prove that its own engineers were capable of constructing a building on an even more grandiose scale. Baekdu Mountain Architects & Engineers started construction on the tower in 1987. Its name translates to “capital of willows” and it was a historic moniker of Pyongyang. The building consists of three triangular sections, each 100 meters long. The sections converge at the summit, giving an overall pyramidal outline to the structure. It is a gigantic building containing roughly 360,000 square meters, roughly 67 football fields, of floor space. At the apex of the hotel is a 40-meter-tall, eight-floor conical structure, which was supposed to house seven revolving restaurants. The hotel’s original plans called for 3,000 rooms, as well as plenty of space for additional commercial venues. According to the original plan, the hotel was supposed to open in 1989, however, construction problems forced the government to postpone its opening several times. In the early 1990s, multiple problems hit the project. Poor quality materials, electricity shortages, and a widespread famine in the country all became serious obstacles to the completion of the building. Expected foreign investments never materialized. Finally, in 1992, construction was halted. Japanese sources estimate that over the course of its construction, the project swallowed over two percent of North Korea’s GDP, or roughly 750 million US dollars. The hotel’s empty shell was left standing empty for 16 years. Due to the financial burden the project placed on the already starving nation, and the drab and menacing look of the naked concrete structure, foreign media dubbed the hotel the “World’s Worst Building” and the “Hotel of Doom.” Nevertheless, work resumed in 2008, and a slick glass facade was installed and finished by 2011. The new official date for the opening of the Hotel was set for 2012, on the 100th anniversary of the birth of the Great Leader Kim Il Sung. Plans ground to a halt for a second time in March 2013, when the company that expressed interest in running the hotel pulled out; likely in response to North Korea’s nuclear tests. As of 2016, the building remains closed.",
2,North Korea's International Friendship Exhibition Hall,"North Pyongan Province, North Korea",A bizarre collection of gifts to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il from the despots of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/north-koreas-international-friendship-exhibition-hall,"If you are an iron-fisted despot or terrorist organization, what do you get another tyrannical dictator as a gift? It would seem, judging from North Korea’s “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” that going with a dead animal is always a safe bet. Located in the UN recognized biosphere reserve of Mount Myohyang, North Korea’s “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” is an exercise in contradictions. First off, for North Korea, one of the most isolated countries in the world, having an “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” itself is a bit of a contradiction. In essence, it amounts to an enormous collection of gifts given to Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il by various other communist, terrorist, and despotic regimes. Among the over 100,000 items gifted to the Kims are: Green railway cars from Mao and Stalin, a bronze tank from the USSR headquarters in East Germany, a gold cigarette case from Yugoslavia’s Tito,a 25-watt boombox from the People’s Republic of China Communist Party which seems kind of cheap, considering, a gem-encrusted silver sword and reproduction of a Moslem mosque from Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat, and an antique gramophone from China’s first premier Zhou Enlai. This isn’t to say the US has never given anything. Yet another of the contradictions of the “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” is that gifts have indeed been given by the democratic western world, albeit only a few, and are proudly displayed. The circumstances of the gifts from the US are unknown and probably date to Kim Il Sung’s era, but include a book, vase, and mirror, three pewter and silver pieces, and two homemade art objects. One can’t help but wonder who made these “art objects” and what they could possibly be. Among the other gifts from the west is a basketball signed by Micheal Jordan, and given (for what reason it is unclear) by Madeleine Albright. One of the more bizarre gifts are perfect copies of the black limousine cruisers seen in “The Untouchables” from Soviet leaders Georgy Malenkov and Nikolai Bulganina. Obviously less concerned with impressing North Korea, Gorbachev sent only a Glass vase with the Communist star on it. Mongolia sent silver chopsticks, while the Chairman of the Journalist Association of Kuwait sent a pen set. From various Industrialists trying to woo Kim Jong Il: a robot drink server, wooden mace, astronaut’s suit, Sony Walkman, Casio keyboard, Yamaha organ, football signed by Pele, and an old Apple computer – which seems like someone might have just been getting rid of their trash – and once again with a somewhat unimpressive display, a tiny rubber ashtray from the Hwabei Tire Factory in China. But by far the most popular theme for gifts given by one dictator to another is taxidermy. Fidel Castro gave a crocodile-skin briefcase, and Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator who was overthrown and killed by his own people, gave a bear head mounted on a red satin pillow. Lebanon gave Water buffalo-horn handles and the president of Tanzania gave an ivory lion. The National Black United Front gave Kim a small butterfly collection, at some point Canada gave North Korea a polar bear skin, and someone gave a tiger claw positioned as to be tearing through an American map. Of course, the most creative and unusual of the gifts belongs not to a dictator or even a head of state, but naturally, a revolutionary. The Sandinistas of Nicaragua donated an upright grinning alligator, holding out a wooden tray of cocktail glasses. It comes with a matching ashtray. While to an outsider the museum represents a bizarre collection, with a remarkable amount of kitsch, ashtrays, and uninteresting consumer goods, it is not outsiders that are the intended audience. North Koreans have almost no contact with the outside world, and this is one place in which they are allowed to see many of the goods from around the world. The aim is to convince them that their leaders are universally admired and lavished with gifts. One of the hall’s guards is quoted as having noted the basketball signed by Micheal Jordan and saying “When the general plays with that ball, it proves that he controls the whole world in his hands.” For that North Korean Guard, Kim Jong Un, like his father and grandfather, really does hold the whole world in his hands.",
3,Mansu Hill Grand Monument,"Pyongyang, North Korea",A giant bronze monument to Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il is one of the most sacred sites in North Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mansu-hill-grand-monument,"On Mansu Hill in North Korea’s capital city, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stand a staggering 20 meters of bronze. This memorial monument allows the Great Leaders—who are immortal in the eyes of the people—to be remembered forever. It is one of the most sacred places in the DPRK. As such, visitors are expected to show the correct visiting etiquette—purchasing flowers to lay at the giant statues’ feet, marching in solemn line, hand by your sides and bowing. Photographs of just part of the monument are forbidden and considered insulting; photos must be framed to include the entire monument. Kim Il-sung—the one with his arm outstretched away from the 70-meter-wide mosaic of Mount Paektu— was the original monument, unveiled in 1972 to celebrate the leader’s 60th birthday. (Reportedly the statue was originally covered in gold leaf, but was changed to the less expensive bronze at the insistence of China.)  After his death, the leader’s son, Kim Jong-il joined him in bronze. On either side of the two Great Leaders, there are enormous stones with KWP flags and 228 bronze figures all standing at 5 meters high. This sculpture is symbolic of the socialist revolution and the struggle against North Korea’s imperialist enemies, the Japanese. The American enemies are not forgotten either; they have a slogan dedicated to them: “Let us drive out US imperialism and reunify the country.”",
4,Taedonggang Brewing Company,"Pyongyang, North Korea",An English brewery transported to North Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taedonggang-brewing-company,"The team first arrived in the rural English town of Trowbridge in the summer of 2000. There were two brewers, two engineers, and eight government officials. They were all from North Korea, and they had come to take the brewery. Their leader, Kim Jong Il (nicknamed “Kim Jong Ale” by the residents of Trowbridge), had recently decided that North Korea needed a better state-run brewery. But instead of building a brewery from scratch, the North Korean leader decided to go shopping for one. For £1.5 million, North Korea bought the 175-year-old Ushers of Trowbridge Brewery. A team of Russians came in to entirely dismantle the brick-walled factory, then the North Koreans shipped all four million pounds of it back to Pyongyang. The crew left nothing, taking every vat, keg, pipe, nut, bolt, tile, and toilet seat in the brewery. They wanted to take the brewmaster himself, but had to settle for just his knowledge. Korean translators spent weeks with him poring over beer-making schematics. A mere 18 months later, in 2002, the Russian team had reassembled the factory on a cabbage field in East Pyongyang. Since named the Taedonggang Brewing Company, the brewery produced seven styles of beer, named pragmatically from light pilsner “Beer Number One” (“Taedonggang 1”) to dark, chocolatey dunkel “Beer Number Seven.” (They have since added at least one more.) Taedonggang is considered some of the best beer available on the Korean Peninsula, and even within Asia. Despite the improved state-run brewing game, most North Koreans still prefer cheaper, harder stuff such as the local liquor, soju. Rural North Koreans must use food rations to buy beer, which makes it a luxury item few can afford. In the country’s capital, men receive beer vouchers (usually 1–2 liters a month) that can be redeemed in a Pyongyang bar. But for the most part, beer is still an urban, middle-class affair, more akin to a nice glass of wine than a party beverage. Although North Korea and the Taedonggang Brewing Company would like the world to focus on their surprisingly good beer, the brewery still remains the property of a mysterious and harsh dictatorship. In 2016, Pyongyang held its first-ever beer festival, which attracted 45,000 visitors. In 2017, however, the festival was canceled by the government without explanation.","For foreigners, your best bet is checking for tour operators that visit the brewery. Otherwise, Taedonggang's beers can sometimes be found—depending on the state of sanctions and international relations—in grocery stores in countries such as China."
5,The USS Pueblo,"Pyongyang, North Korea","Captured in 1968, the Cold War spy ship is the only U.S. Navy vessel being held by a foreign government.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-uss-pueblo-pyongyang-north-korea,"The U.S.S. Pueblo is an American intelligence-gathering ship captured by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on January 23, 1968. The “Pueblo Crisis” was a major incident in the Cold War but remained little-known, as it was overshadowed a week later by the Tet Offensive attacks of the Vietnam War. At the time of the capture, North Korea stated that the ship had strayed into their territorial waters, but the United States maintained that the vessel was in international waters. The Pueblo was initially approached by a submarine chaser and its nationality challenged. The Pueblo responded by raising the U.S. flag. The DPRK vessel then ordered the crew to stand down or be fired upon. The Pueblo attempted to move away but was attacked by the sub chaser, three torpedo boats, and two MiG-21 fighter aircraft. The Pueblo was taken into port at Wonsan and the crew moved to POW camps; upon their release, some of the crew stated that they had been starved and regularly tortured while in North Korean custody. This treatment had worsened when the North Koreans realized that their prisoners were secretly giving them the finger in staged propaganda photos. Commander Lloyd M. Bucher, Commanding Officer of the Pueblo, was tortured and put through a mock firing squad ordeal in an effort to make him confess. Eventually the North Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented. On December 23, 1968—exactly 11 months after being taken prisoner—the crew was taken by buses to the DMZ border with South Korea and ordered to walk south across the “Bridge of No Return.” The Pueblo officially remains a commissioned vessel of the United States Navy and is currently moored along the Taedong River in Pyongyang. It is the only ship of the U.S. Navy currently being held “captive” and is now used as a war museum. Tours are officially conducted by military guides who refer to Americans as “U.S. Imperialist Aggressors,” and a propaganda video is shown prior to commencement of the tour in case any doubt remains.",As with most sites of interest in North Korea this has to be organised officially. Photos are allowed from on board the vessel (including of the guides and .50 cal guns) but not of the exterior from the dock.
6,Ideals of the North Korean Workers' Party Monument,"Pyongyang, North Korea",A symbol of the Workers' Party of North Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-the-people,"A hammer (for workers), sickle (farmers) and paintbrush (academics) form North Korea’s Monument to the People. In true DPRK fashion, the symbolism does not stop there. Because it was erected for the 50th anniversary of the Workers’ Party, the monument is precisely 50 meters (165 feet) tall. Not only that, the number of bricks around its belt symbolise the date of Kim Jung II’s birth. It reads “Long live the Workers’ Party of Korea, the organizer and guide of all victories of the Korean people.” Inside the monument there are three large bronze pictures that represent the roots of the party, the unity of the people and the party’s vision.",Do not walk ahead of your guards - although hidden from sight there are military personnel stationed here and they are not shy about coming out to shout at you if you get a little ahead of yourself!
7,Juche Tower,"Pyongyang, North Korea",A highly symbolic tower in honor of Supreme Leader Kim Il-sung's personal philosophy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/juche-tower,"The massive Juche Tower was a birthday present from North Korea to its original Great Leader. “Juche” was the ideology Comrade Kim Il-sung structured his empire around, which roughly translates to “self-reliance.” In loosest terms, it drew upon Marxist-Leninist principles and asserted that every Korean should harness their own destiny in order to make the nation great. There’s much more to Juche; it has been credited with creating the cult of personality surrounding North Korean leaders. It would later become known by another name: “Kimilsung-ism.” The Juche Tower was built in 1982 on the banks of the Taedong River in celebration of Kim Il-sung’s 70th birthday. As everything in North Korea is symbolic, the Juche Tower makes no exception. It’s comprised of 25,550 blocks—one for every day of Il-sung’s life. Some have even said that he was the architect of the grand monument to his own philosophy, but this is unlikely. The monolithic structure is reminiscent of the United States’ Washington Monument, and in fact, Juche Tower is considered to be in direct competition with the famed Washington, D.C. monument, as it is exactly one meter taller than the American obelisk. This makes it one of the highest monuments in the world, second only to Houston’s San Jacinto Monument. The tower is a popular tourist destination, where visitors can ride to the top in an elevator to view Pyongyang from above. For the heights-avoidant, there are videos displayed at the base of the tower explaining the monument’s significance to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to the philosophy of Juche, and to Eternal Leader Kim Il-sung.",

There are exhibits devoted to conquests such as the USS Pueblo captured in 1968—its shattered glass and large bullet holes are on display, and visitors can board the ship and listen to dramatic accounts of how it was taken (omitting accounts about the torture the crew endured for months d). Within the building there is a 360-degree diorama of the Battle of Daejon, and you can find accounts of how America caused the two halves of Korea to become parted, and hopes for a successful reunion.

This is a very sacred site in North Korea. Visitors are required to wear formal attire and no open footwear is permitted. Hair must be brushed and one is expected to look at their very most presentable. As the complex is huge, it takes quite a while to get to the leaders’ tombs. Entrance is via a sort of giant structure that blasts air like a hairdryer, for unknown purposes. The bodies are heavily guarded and all visitors (with absolutely no exception) are required to walk in lines of three with hands by their sides and are required to bow numerous times at all sides of both leaders. Exit from the mausoleum is via a large museum dedicated to lives of the two dictators.

11,Chollima Statue,"Pyongyang, North Korea",This North Korean pegasus statue was built as a symbol of the speed and perseverance of North Korean workers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chollima-statue,"Rising above Mansu Hill in North Korea is a soaring pegasus with a pair of citizens riding the majestic beast into the metaphorical future. This is the image of Chollima, one of the most important symbols in North Korea. Located in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the towering statue is a monument to Korean workers, the symbol of which crowns the monument. The symbol itself is of Chinese origin, a magical horse that is so fast, no man can mount it, being an Eastern allegory to the pegasus. The name even translates to “thousand-mile horse.” The symbol was introduced to North Korea by in 1956 by Kim Il-Sung, who used it as the mascot for his Chollima Workers Movement. The country was in need of rapid reconstruction following the Korean War, and Il Sung used the slogan, “Let us dash forward in the spirit of Chollima!” to invoke the mythical creature’s speed and perseverance over seemingly impossible goals. The campaign seemed to work too, leading to years of rapid reconstruction. Unfortunately, people are not magical tireless horses, and by the 1960s the movement had petered out for the most part. However, the Chomilla remains a popular icon in the country, even lending its name to the national football team. There are small versions of the statue to be found all over the country, but the main Chollma Statue in Pyongyang was built in 1961 and stands over 150 feet tall. Despite the legend, it does not move at all.",
12,Arch of Triumph,"Pyongyang, North Korea",Pyongyang’s Arch of Triumph is the second tallest triumphal arch in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arch-of-triumph,"The Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang, North Korea was modeled on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but was built to be just a little bit taller than its French counterpart. The Arch of Triumph was officially opened on April 15, 1982 to mark the 70th birthday of Kim Il-sung, the first leader of North Korea. It was President Kim Il-sung who, according to North Korean history, led the Korean resistance to Japan from 1925 to 1945 (although he was only 13 in 1925). The arch was built on the site of Kim’s triumphant return to Pyongyang in 1945, marking the end of the Japanese occupation of the city. The Arch of Triumph is a vast structure, its imposing nature only enhanced by the relative isolation in which it sits, alone on an expansive square surrounded by roads that see little traffic. At 197 feet (60 m) high and 164 feet (50 m) wide, it’s the second tallest triumphal arch in the world after the Monumento a la Revolución in Mexico City. It’s also 33 feet taller than the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, upon which it was undoubtedly modeled. The arch is steeped in symbolism, with references to the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the Korean nation and, of course, Kim Il-sung. The structure is apparently made from 25,500 blocks of white granite, each one representing a day in the life of President Kim Il-sung up to his 70th birthday. On either side of the arch are the dates 1925 and 1945, referring to the period during which Kim spent in resistance to the Japanese. Also inscribed on the arch are the words of the revolutionary hymn “Song of General Kim Il-sung,” and 70 azalea reliefs representing each year of Kim’s life. Bronze statues on the arch pay homage to the three pillars of the Workers’ Party of Korea, showing workers, farmers and the intelligentsia, and the soldiers who fought for the Korean Revolutionary Army. Also represented is Mount Paektu, a sacred mountain that played a part in the fight against Japanese occupation (Kim Il-sung organized his resistance in the dense forests surrounding the mountain). Inside the Arch of Triumph, meanwhile, are a series of viewing platforms and rooms connected by elevators and stairs. From the top, visitors have impressive views across the surrounding neighborhood, Kim Il-sung Stadium and Moranbong Park.","The Arch of Triumph is located at the intersection of Moranbong Street, Chilsungmun Street and Kaesonmun Street in the Moranbong Distict of Pyongyang. The Kaeson Metro Station is located nearby. Some tourist buses coming from the airport into Pyongyang stop at the arch to let visitors have a quick walk around. Alternatively, you can arrange a tour to the arch once in Pyongyang. The Arch of Triumph is open every day. Entrance to the rooms and viewing points inside the arch costs about $5 US. Check your nation’s travel advisory for any warnings before traveling to North Korea."
13,Mohenjo-Daro,"Moenjodaro, Pakistan",This lost city belongs to one of the earliest civilizations in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mohenjodaro,"Contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley Civilization was, as the name suggests, centered around the Indus River basin. However, little was known about this ancient culture until the 1920s, when a couple of long-buried cities were first excavated by modern archaeologists. One of these rediscovered sites was Mohenjo-Daro. The name Mohenjo-Daro, meaning “Mound of the Dead Men,” is a modern one, as the original city was anything but. Spreading over an area of 300 hectares (about 750 acres) with a peak population of about 40,000, Mohenjo-Daro was one of the largest and most advanced cities in the world during its time. Laid out in a rectilinear grid and built out of baked bricks, the city featured a complex water management system, complete with a sophisticated drainage and covered sewer system, and baths in nearly every house. The original name of the city is forgotten, although one scholar speculates it may have been Kukkutarma, or “The City of the Cockerel” (a.k.a., Rooster City). The uniform size of the manufactured bricks used to build Mohenjo-Daro, the discovery of standardized weights and measures used to facilitate trade, the considerable degree of civil engineering and urban planning evident in the city’s development, and the fact these characteristics are shared with other Indus-Sarasvati Valley sites (most notably Harappa, the first site to be excavated) suggest a highly organized civilization with bureaucratic coordination of things like construction and commerce. Given that, it is perhaps puzzling to note that Mohenjo-Daro does not seem to feature any palaces, temples, monuments, or anything else indicative of a seat of governing power. The city’s largest structures are things like public baths (including one that had an underground furnace to heat the pools), assembly halls, a marketplace, ancient apartment buildings, and the aforementioned sewer system — all things that suggest an emphasis on an orderly, clean, and modest civil society. Built around 2500 BCE, Mohenjo-Daro — like the rest of the Indus Valley Civilization — went into sudden decline for unknown reasons in 1900 BCE and was subsequently abandoned possibly because of the drying up of a major Sarawati River. After its rediscovery in the 1920s, a few decades of excavations were ultimately discovered to be exposing the ancient structures to considerably weather damage, and all further archaeological work on the site was halted in 1966; today, only salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects are allowed.",
14,Attabad Lake,"Hunza Nagar, Pakistan",This dazzlingly turquoise mountain lake was created in the wake of a natural disaster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/attabad-lake,"On January 4, 2010, a massive landslide thundered down the sides of the remote Hunza Valley in the Gilgit Baltistan Region of Northern Pakistan. The village of Attabad was buried, killing 20 people and destroying 26 homes. The disaster, however, was far from over. The landslide had dammed the Hunza River, and the rapidly rising waters of the newly formed lake threatened villages both below and above the dam. The waters behind the newly formed natural dam soon rose to a depth of more than 300 feet, creating a lake that eventually measured 13 miles in length. As the lake grew, it displaced some 6,000 people from upstream villages and flooded a 12-mile stretch of the Karakoram Highway, leaving the region stranded. In May 2010, local authorities excavated a spillway to guide the flow over the dam. A month later, however, too much water was flowing over the landslide. Below the dam, lower Shishkat was completely submerged and Gulmit partly flooded. By August 2010, the spillway was beginning to perform well. But by that time, as many as 25,000 individuals had been affected, either as a result of the initial landslide, flooding, or due to the destruction of the highway. The government provided aid to the victims, but many remained in fear of further disaster. If the dam burst, 50,000 people living downstream could be in peril, as well as a road that served as an important trade link with China. Thankfully, the dam held. And from the disaster came an unexpected attraction that would eventually lead to a tourism boom in the area: Attabad Lake, a shimmering turquoise lake that is now one of the main attractions in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. The lake’s chilly waters are a stunning turquoise in spring and early summer, when meltwater from the surrounding mountains deposits glacial silt into the lake. In winter, the lake typically freezes over. Most visitors come to enjoy this spectacular landscape when the lake is ice-free. Various recreational activities take place on and around the lake, including boating, jet skiing, and fishing. And with the rise in tourism, an increasing number of hotels and guesthouses have sprung up around the lake, as well as a handful of campsites. Presumably, the influx of tourists has benefited many of the locals who were affected by the landslide. And now that the highway has been rebuilt with new tunnels, access is better than it was before. Still, if you take a boat out onto the calm surface of Attabad Lake, it’s strange to think that 300 meters below you sits a once-lively village. Now Attabad lake is one of the top tourist attraction points in Pakistan. However, with the level of water rising, the government of Pakistan is planning to build a dam around the lake.","Attabad Lake is about half an hour east of Karimabad, the capital of the Hunza District in the Gilgit-Baltistan province of Pakistan (Karimabad, incidentally, was named one of the five ""Best Tourist Sites"" in Pakistan by The Guardian). If you arrive independently, you can arrange trips on the lake with local guides or in Karimabad. Most boat trips tend to last at least an hour. Alternatively, you can organize five-day tours from Islamabad, which often include the Hunza Valley, Attabad Lake, and the Pakistan-China border region."
15,Chaukhandi Tombs,"Karachi, Pakistan",Reputedly haunted sandstone necropolis with exquisite stone carvings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chaukhandi-tombs,"If you’re going to bury someone above ground, the container should probably be both secure and reverent. This knowledge seems to be almost instinctive, as ornate tombs and mausoleums can be found sheltering bodies above the surface in cemeteries from New Orleans to Timbuktu. The most famous of these tombs are clearly the great pyramids of Egypt, but other examples of respectful celebration through decoration are found the world over. The Chaukhandi Tombs near Karachi, Pakistan are a unique example of such burials. Buried south to north – unusual for the area and time period – these tombs are constructed out of huge sandstone slabs, which are delicately stacked into a finessed pyramid shape. The slabs were then clearly painstakingly carved with intricate patterns, drawings and relatable scenes. Built between the 15th and 18th centuries, the Chaukhandi Tombs now form a remarkably well-preserved necropolis that often attracts curious visitors and archeologists alike, but the area is not without foreboding legends. Beyond the elaborate decoration of the tombs, another feature the tombs seem to share with similar necropoli around the world is the conviction locals tend to have that the area is haunted. The tombs at Chaukhandi are renowned for being one of the most haunted sites in the region, and visitors are particularly warned against entering the graveyard at night. Avoiding the tombs at night isn’t bad advice, haunting or otherwise, because the details and drawings on these fascinating artifices are clearly best experienced in the broad light of day. A fact for which many visitors are likely very thankful.",

Seeing that all the horses were doing so and taking note, a soldier himself tried one and found that the rocks were quite salty. The Khewra salt deposits had been discovered. Today, some 2330 years later, the Khewra salt mines are the second largest in the world — behind the Sifto Canada, Inc., salt mine in Goderich, Ontario — turning out 325,000 tons of salt per year, and an estimated 220 million tons over its lifetime. This is barely even a dent in the massive salt stores here, which are said to be 6.687 billion tons. Officially, salt mining wasn’t recorded until the 1200s under the Janjua-Raja’ tribe, but salt has probably been mined and traded here since Alexander’s time. Covering an area of 110 sq. km, 228 meters or 748 feet deep (with 11 separate stories), the massive mine has over 40 kilometers of tunnels running some 730 meters, or nearly half a mile into the mountain under which the salt deposits are found. To keep the huge space from collapsing in on itself, only fifty percent of the salt found is mined; the other half serves as support columns to hold up the mine. With such a massive area, a large workforce, and the ease of carving and building with salt bricks, some interesting sights have been built within the salt mine. Among the earliest structure built within the mine is the small Badshahi Mosque, complete with a small salt minaret. Built more recently, specifically to attract tourists, are small salt versions of the Great Wall of China, the Mall road of Murree, Lahore’s Shimla hill, and the Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. Both the mosque and the miniatures are built from salt bricks, which vary in color from red to pink to white, and which are now lighted electrically and radiate a beautiful warm glow. At times, the many colors and bricks of light give the mine a sort of disco-Yellow-Brick-Road look. Other sights — and there are many — include a 75-meter-tall “assembly hall” chamber with stairs spiraling up the walls, a 25-foot-long Salt Bridge called the Pul-saraat (an allusion to the Islamic “Pul-e-Saraat,” a bridge you must cross on Judgment Day which is described as “thinner than a strand of hair and sharper than a sword”), brine ponds, and beautiful salt-crystal formations such as stalactites. Much of this can be seen from the narrow gauge electric railway, in place since the 1930s, which once extracted salt from the mines and now brings tourists into them. The Khewra salt mine even has its own fully functioning postal office, for use by the workers. The post office is built entirely from salt bricks and is the only post office built out of salt in the world. While a popular tourist destination today, the salt mines were the scene of brutal oppression and forced work by the British in the 1800s. Miners were locked into the mines and not allowed to leave until they fulfilled their quotas. This included pregnant women and children, and a number of children were born within the mine. Strikes were met with violence from the British, and in 1876, twelve minors were shot and killed at the entrance to the mines. Their graves can be seen at the middle gates of the mines. One can taste the output of this salt mine by going to their local grocery and looking for “Himalayan Salt,” a reddish or pink rock salt. It is significantly more delicious then your average table salt, and comes with a much more interesting back story.","Motorway M2:The fastest way to reach Khewra mines is via motorway M2. The mines are located 30km east of Lilla interchange towards Pind Dadan Khan. Road signs are quite visible. Highway N5: A slower but scenic approach is also available from GT road?from Mandra.?Distances?from Mandra (0km)are:?Chakwal (63km), Choa Saidan Shah (93km) and Khewra (103km).

From around the 14th century through to the 18th century CE, the Thatta region was inhabited by local royalty who used Makli Hill as their communal burial site. Each new succession of rulers would build elaborate burial structures, often differing wildly from one another, creating a massive and varied cornucopia of historic graves unlike anything else on the planet. Kings, queens, scholars, holy men, and other figures of import are buried on the hilltop in their ornate stone tombs. Around 120,000 people are thought to be buried on the hill. Hindu, Islamic, Asian, and other styles can be picked out among the collection of tombs, which have been split into four distinct periods of creation corresponding to the ruling society of the time. Some of the tombs have tall columns, while others are decorated with sweeping arches. All together, the hill is like some sort of archaeological dreamscape. The site, while in need of a great deal of preservation, is able to be visited by tourists and necropolis fans. The latter especially will not be disappointed.",
18,Lahore Fort Elephant Path,"Lahore, Pakistan",These stairs were built to accommodate royals mounted on elephants.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lahore-fort-elephant-path,"Because it would be a shame to leave one’s elephant parked outside the citadel, the magnificent Lahore Fort in Pakistan features an entranceway crafted for an entire pachyderm parade. As the Mughal Empire expanded across the Indian subcontinent in the 16th century, Lahore became an increasingly important stronghold. Its strategic location was key in tying the expanded Mughal territories to the fortified cities of Kabul, Multan, and Kashmir. The city’s fortress was built under the reign of Emperor Akbar between 1566-1605 and housed several Mughal (and later Sikh) rulers over the following centuries. The two sections of the fort are divided by usage - an administrative portion and a residential portion. The elephant stairs (or Hathi Paer) are part of the private entrance to the royal quarters, and effectively allowed royalty to ascend all the way to the doorway before dismounting. In order to accommodate the lumbering creatures, the stairs were designed with wide treads, but minimal height (a balking elephant can really dampen the mood of a procession). Although it’s been centuries since a herd of jewel and silk-laden elephants travelled several abreast along this sloping corridor, it was once certainly the most magnificent driveway in the world.",
19,Tomb of Ali Mardan Khan,"Lahore, Pakistan","This grand Pakistani mausoleum can only be accessed via an almost 1,000 foot long alleyway.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-ali-mardan-khan,"The grand Tomb of Ali Mardan Khan has stood for centuries as a lovely funerary monument for the Mughal-era governor. While it was once surrounded by a lush garden, it now sites largely forgotten surrounded by industrial rail yards. Adding to the sense of melancholy, the side is only accessible via a macabre passageway lined by barbwire cutting across rail yards. Originally built around the 1650s, the tomb holds the remains of Ali Mardan Khan, a former governor in the region. Before being buried in his lovely, octagonal tomb, Khan governed the areas of Kashmir, Lahore and Kabul in the mid-1600s. The large brick tomb had actually been prepared for Khan’s mother, but when he died in 1657, and was buried adjacent to her inside, the tomb came to bear his name. At the time of its construction, it likely stood in the middle of a richly attended paradise garden, like many similar tombs. In its original form, the tomb was likely covered in colorful decoration, but time has taken its toll on the tomb, and the exterior is now a uniform brick color that belies its construction. Nonetheless, the iconic dome on top of the structure. and it’s decorative columns still stand. Even inside, the actual tomb, which lays below ground level, is often surrounded by offerings left by visitors. Local rumor has it that Khan was considered a holy man, and many refer to the tomb as his shrine. Today, the garden is long gone, and the site of the historic tomb is surrounded on all sides by railway yards. In order to keep people out of the yards, but still allow access to the tomb, an almost 1000 foot long passageway was created out of unbroken brick walls that enclose a narrow alleyway path. While it seems like a drab entrance to such a grand tomb, it manages to make actually arriving at the site all the more impressive.",This monument is located behind the fruit market at Shalimar Road near Gulabi Chowki in Mughalpura Lahore
20,Fairy Meadows,"Diamer District, Pakistan",A place as enchanting as the journey to reach it is harrowing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fairy-meadows,"Nestled in the Raikhot valley high in the Himalayas, it’s not hard to guess why this lush green mountain pasture at the foot of a majestic snowy peak was named Fairy Meadows. Known as “Joot” among locals, the place was given the name Märchenwiese (literally “Fairy Tale Meadows”) by German mountaineers who were no doubt astounded when they first glimpsed this idyllic landscape. At 3,300 meters (10,826 feet) above sea level, the wide grassy meadow surrounded by dense alpine forest is fed by waters from a glacier formed by the Nanga Parbat, the ninth-highest mountain in the world (and second-highest in Pakistan, after K2) that towers over Fairy Meadows from the south. A magical setting indeed — made all the more wondrous by the dangerous road one must take to get here. There is only one road to Fairy Meadows, and it isn’t your average tricky mountain road; in 2013, the World Health Organization ranked it as the second deadliest road on the planet. The windy narrow gravel mountain road is open to locals only (thanks to the high number of fatalities the way has claimed), who ferry visitors from Raikhot bridge to the village of Tato, one six-person Jeep-load at a time. If you make it through the ride without ending up a smoldering heap at the bottom of the ravine that stands in as the “shoulder” of the road, you still have a three- to four-hour hike from Tato before you can take in the hidden splendor of Fairy Meadows. But once you’re there, you’ll never want to leave! (Because you’ll be terrified to go back the way you came.) Visitors to Fairy Meadows can find accommodation in small on-site cabins or designated camp sites (the Pakistani government declared the location a National Park in 1995). The site serves as a launching point for mountain climbers summiting the northern face of the Nanga Parbat.",

In a world of commercial space flight and supersonic jet flight, it can be easy to forget just how hard it can be to traverse certain parts of this planet. But those living in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Northern Pakistan were cut off from the rest of Pakistan until 1978 due to the mountainous terrain and lack of roads. You could take a small airplane, but that was reserved for only the richest citizens. For everyone else, the only way to travel was by walking across mountain passes to Rawalpindi. In 1978, the Karakoram Highway was completed and the region was connected, but inter-region travel remains as difficult as it was 100 years ago. Regular aspects of travel through this region include the rickety cable and plank bridges that cross Northern Pakistan’s mountain streams and rivers. Among these is the Hussaini Hanging Bridge, crossing Borit Lake in the Upper Hunza. This rope bridge is both long and poorly maintained. Many planks are missing, and strong winds shake the bridge as you cross it.  As of now, there is only one suspension bridge connecting the Hussaini Village with Zarabad (located across the Hunza River) Despite its dangerous looks, however, the Hussaini is is a relatively safe bridge and has become one of the most sought-after tourist attractions, with hikers testing their nerves as they carefully work their way across.",Ticket price for visiting the place is 200 pakistan rupees There is a small Juice Outlet that serves the fresh cherries juice and it is a must try.

With capacity for 100,000 worshippers on its grounds, it dwarfed the Taj Mahal, a structure that could fit inside the massive courtyard. Although the mosque seems like a tremendous religious structure, its history has almost seen more use as a military base. For the first 70 years after its construction in 1673, the mosque was known simply for its great size, and was visible from almost 10 miles away. The crown jewel of Lahore, the Badshahi Mosque was a symbol of power in the Mughal Empire. Cursed by its size and location, when the region was cast into civil war and overtaken by Sikhs, the mosque began a new history of exploitation for military purposes. At the turn of the century, Sikhs were in control of Lahore, and began using the mosque as a stable for horses and other military units. 50 years later during the Sikh Civil War, guns were mounted on the 170 foot high minarets to bombard a group that had taken refuge in the nearby Lahore Fort. Throughout British rule, the mosque continued to be used for military storage, and was in a bad state of preservation. After 1947, when Pakistan became an independent Muslim state, the mosque was returned to its original purpose, and extensive repairs were undertaken. Repairs have happened continuously through 2008, and the Badshahi Mosque is now almost restored to its original 17th century condition.",

They weren’t historical landmarks for exploration – they were private property, and sometimes residences, populated by soldiers with a job to do. In the desert of Cholistan, the soldiers are long gone, but one of the most remarkable forts of the medieval world still exists as private property, owned by the royal Abassi family who also keep a necropolis for their family on the property. Derawar Fort is more than 1 kilometer in circumference and 30 meters high, featuring 40 stunning bastions rising out of the vast expanse of empty desert. Its ramparts are wide and smooth, creating an imposing structure unlikely to be breached by advancing forces and, more useful for modern times, an unique appearance more compelling than typical straight-walled castles. It’s very difficult to reach Derawar Fort in its remote location, and typically one needs to hire a special guide to take them on the full-day journey to the site of the fort. That said, pretty much anyone can go look at it, but to go inside, one needs special permisssion from the Amir of Bahawalpur, so visitors need to plan ahead to get the full experience.",One day's journey from Bahawalpur.
25,Kalasha Valleys,"Chitral District, Pakistan",Unique pagan culture in three extremely remote mountain valleys.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kalasha-valleys-pagan,"In the devoutly Muslim lands of Pakistan, the presence of the pagans in the Kalasha Valleys is quite an anomaly. The three valleys of the Kalash people—Bumburet, Rumbur, and Birir—form a cultural island where ancient traditions and pagan beliefs have managed to sustain themselves throughout time, in a land locally known as Kafiristan, the “Land of the Non-Believers”. The origins of the Kalash people remain mysterious, but it’s generally believed that the Kalash are descendants of Alexander the Great’s army, which seized the region in the third century BC; however, genetic research could not pinpoint their beginnings. The culture of the Kalash people is highly complex, comprised of a belief-system with a multitude of gods and is characterized by rigorous rules regarding taboos, religious ceremonies and animal sacrifices. One of the most unique features of the Kalash people is their relationship with periods. Women retreat into a wooden hut called a Bashali and they can not be touched by others during this time. Since the three valleys are extremely remote, they have more or less successfully resisted Islamization, unlike the Kalash in neighboring Afghanistan, who were forced to convert to Islam in 1893. Pakistan’s government often uses the colorfully dressed Kalash people to demonstrate the diversity of the country. However, today the Kalash people face enormous pressure from surrounding Islamic communities who are pushing toward Islamization of the valleys, one of the valleys already having a Muslim majority. That, coupled with the fact that the valleys are in a region where the Pakistani government has de-facto no control, makes the future of the ancient culture of the Kalashas unknown.",

Brought to the attention of the outside world by way of tales from Indian and Greco-Roman literature, Taxila presents an explorable walk through the rise of human civilization in Southeast Asia, from Neolithic tombs all the way through to the footsteps of the Buddha himself. Located at the junction of ancient trade routes bestowing prosperity to the area, Taxila is a giant in terms of both size and scope of its archeological holdings. Three distinct masonry techniques divide the site into three separate “cities” hailing from three distinct time periods. In addition to its famed Buddhist stupas, some of which predate the tradition of physical representations of the Buddha, Taxila is considered by many to have the world’s first university, Takṣaśilā. Moreover, the ruins at Sarai Kala were home to Early Harappan remains dating back to as early as 2900 BCE. Though far less well-known than many other historic sites, few places on Earth have such a concentration of our historical record; so it was with little surprise that UNESCO Designated Taxila a World Heritage Site in 1980.  With this influx of preservation and curatorial-mindedness, a museum was created to provide an efficient guide to the three millennia of human civilization underfoot, making the city’s vast wonders accessible to all.",
27,Shangri-La Lake,Pakistan,The place that allegedly inspired James Hilton's depiction of Shangri-La.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shangri-la-lake,"Shangri-La is a fictional place described by author James Hilton in the 1933 novel “Lost Horizon.” It is described as a harmonious, peaceful, and isolated place, which was inspired by the mythical Buddhist kingdom of Shambhala. Given the description of Shangri-La (a Tibetan word for “Heaven on Earth,”) one might not immediately think of troubled Pakistan as the proposed location of earthly paradise. It is undisputed that Hilton visited the Northern valleys of Pakistan a couple of years before publishing his book. Nevertheless, the exact location remains unknown, and one can only speculate which place in the Greater Himalayan Region was the main inspiration for his depiction. In an attempt to fuel tourism to Pakistan, the Skardu Valley was promoted as the “true” locale that served as the inspirational source for Hilton. In 1983, the Shangri-La Resort (no relation to the chain of luxury hotels of the same name) was opened at the Lower Kachura Lake, which was then given the moniker Shangri-La Lake. As a result of the continued volatile political situation in Pakistan, the anticipated influx of tourists never came. Thus, today, the resort sits rather forlorn in the undoubtedly beautiful valley. The resort comprises of two buildings of mock-Chinese architecture, as well as an airplane, which once served as a restaurant (but is only sporadically open today). The airplane is a reference to Hilton’s depiction of a plane that crash-landed at Shangri-La – makes the unusual sight of Far East Asian architecture in Pakistan even stranger. Unsurprisingly, the Skardu Valley is not the only place in the greater region which claims to be the “real” Shangri-La. Most of these places are located in the People’s Republic of China. In 2001, Zhongdian County in Yunnan, was even officially renamed Shangri-La County. Additionally, historians regularly claim that certain places in Nepal, Bhutan and India might have been the true inspirational source for Hilton.","Lower Kachura Lake, Skardu Valley, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan"

Each day Ali cakes his face with a thick layer of makeup and bright red lipstick and crawls into the box beneath Mumtaz’s cage, popping his head through a hole in the top to make it look as though his head is attached to a lounging fox carcass. A shawl is placed around Ali’s head to hide the connection and then the visitors begin filtering in. The creature that Ali plays is known as a kitsune, which is said to be able to see the future. Children and adults alike come to the zoo to ask Mumtaz Begum about everything from exam results to visa approvals. Ali gamely provides advise and peppers the interaction with references to his mysterious origin and his diet of juice and cakes.

29,Hiran Minar,"Ranikay, Pakistan",A tower built by an emperor for an antelope.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hiran-minar,"Jahangir was a Mughal emperor who, like all good Mughal emperors, loved to hunt antelope. He also loved his cherished pet Mansraj (meaning “Light of the Mind”) who was an antelope. Something was bound to go wrong. And wrong something did indeed go, when Jahangir was hunting with friends on his game preserve near Sheikhupura when he espied an antelope that proved to be a tempting quarry. The whys and wherefores — errant shot? mistaken identity? logistical difficulties of cervine pet ownership? — have been lost to the mists of time, but what is certain is that poor Mansraj was cut down that day in 1606. Stricken by the loss, Jahangir paid tribute to the memory of his pet by constructing the 100-foot-tall Hiran Minar (meaning “Deer Tower”). The top of the tower includes a place to inter Mansraj’s remains, while the perimeter of the tower features holes that were most likely used to mount the heads of animal trophies taken by the emperor. An odd way to honor an animal friend killed in a hunting mishap? Sure, but grief does strange things to a man. In 1634, Jahangir’s successor Shah Jahan visited his father’s favorite hunting preserve and decided to add to the complex by constructing a large water tank and octagonal pavilion to the east of the memorial tower (for context, this was two years after Shah Jahan started building the Taj Mahal – guy liked to build). The rectangular water tank measures 750 feet by 895 feet and features a sophisticated series of channels and catchment basins to maintain the water level. Brick ramps in the middle of each side of the tank provide access to the water for animals living in the preserve. The octagonal pavilion, which served as a royal retreat, sits in the middle of the tank and is accessible via an arched stone bridge that leads directly from the pavilion to the tower. Despite being upstaged by these newer structures, the original tower still provides the name for the site as a whole, and Hiran Minar remains a testament to a heartwarming — if slightly eccentric — interspecial friendship.","The monument is located off Sheikhupura Hafizabad Road, a few kilometers from Sheikhupura city"

Some monasteries and temples escaped the brunt of the attack, thanks to their relatively inaccessible locations. One of these was the Takht-i-Bahi monastery, an important Buddhist site even today. Takht, in Persian means throne, and bahi means spring, and this throne of springs is situated in the higher reaches of the Mardan province in Pakistan. Though it sustained some damage, it is among the most well preserved early Buddhist sites in the region. It was built as a small stone monastery in the 1st century, and one of the earliest inscriptions found refers to Gondophares, the Indo-Parthian king of the time. Under the patronage of the rulers of different dynasties who followed, more structures were added to the original premises. Over the next 800 years, it developed into a large Buddhist complex, one of the most influential in the region, and it was supported by the nearby fortified town of Sahr-i-Bahlol. The town’s residents regularly carried offerings and food for the monks who lived at Takht-i-Bahi. Despite surviving the invasions that wreaked havoc around it, the monastery saw a slow decline in the 7th century, when influence of Buddhism was on the wane, and donations to the monastery were dwindling. The monastery was abandoned by the monks, and it was only rediscovered in the second half of the 19th century. Excavations were carried out from 1907 and hundreds of statues and sculptures were unearthed. The complex today comprises of the main court of stupas, cells where the monks meditated, meeting halls, and covered passages.

The impenetrable wall snaking up and down along several hills is one of the most recognized travel images recorded - Ranikot Fort is Pakistan’s answer to its much better known Chinese counterpart. At first glance, the similarities of both walls are striking, and it seems that the only difference between the walls are the hills in Pakistan bare no vegetation, unlike the green hills the Great Wall of China is known for. But the Great Wall of Sindh is not a protection barrier like the Great Wall of China. Rather, the walls form the outer defense system of the fort of Ranikot. Within the outer walls there are three inner forts named Miri Kot, Sher Garh and Mohan Kot – and together they constitute what is generally regarded as the largest fort anywhere in the world. The dimensions of the fort are truly impressive – its outer walls measuring more than 35 kilometers in length, and in total the huge fort occupies an area of more than 65 square kilometers, larger than some modern micro states. The fort seems to be contradictory in itself, since this colossus of it was build in the middle of nowhere, and being far away from any significant settlement, it didn’t seem to have a purpose in protecting anything at all. Since little research has taken place at the fort, the current state of knowledge is rather disappointing. Nobody knows who built the fort, or for what purpose it was built. Even the age of the fort remains dubious: while some consider the fort to have been built in the early 20th century, some argue that it might date back to the 9th century. Ranikot Fort is not only neglected by scientists. Until recently the Pakistani government has made no move in promoting Ranikot Fort as a tourist attraction.

This route along the Indus River was part of the Silk Road for thousands of years. It was used by merchant caravans, military expeditions, and explorers who all left their marks on these rocks. Over thousands of years, religions, ideas, knowledge, and cultural exchanges spread along this “highway,” and based on the rock carvings, this area must have been a popular place to stop and rest.

There are hundreds, if not thousands of these petroglyphs in this area, and the earliest ones date back to 600 BC, making some of them nearly 2,700 years old. You would think that this would be an enormous tourist attraction and that the area would be locally and internationally protected, but there is no formal protection. Some of the rocks have recent graffiti painted on them, but this did not seem like a malicious effort to destroy priceless relics, as locally, the artwork is thought of as slightly older graffiti and nothing special.

Construction began on the mosque in 1976, after the late King Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz put up $120 million of his Saudi fortune to have it built in Islamabad. Although it is the 4th largest mosque on earth and covers a whopping 54,000 square feet, the mosque’s design is truly the most intriguing. When first conceived, the mosque was met with great animosity from the traditional community. Without a typical dome, the mosque instead is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by four gigantic minarets. Stabbing 260 feet into the air, the minarets were designed in a perfect one-to-one ratio with the base, to create an invisible cube that alludes to the Kabaa. All totaled, the mosque and its courtyard can hold nearly 300,000 worshippers. Situated against the majestic Margalla Hills and dominating the landscape of Pakistan’s capital, the Faisal Mosque is a sight that cannot be missed on a visit to Pakistan.",
35,Baltit Fort,"Karimabad, Pakistan",Tibetan-influenced mountain fortress in Northern Pakistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baltit-fort,"In more simple times, an awesome house was really the only thing needed for both the defense and definition of one’s empire. That may seem like a quaint notion today, but the grand and enduring structures that resulted are anything but. In the Hunza Valley of northern Pakistan, perched high upon a hilltop overlooking the villages of the valley, Baltit Fort is the perfect example of this melding of defense and definition, and its notably Tibetan architecture makes it as curious as it is stunning. Still standing tall and imposing after more than 700 years, this 14th-century fortress is a reminder of the lay of the land in northern Pakistan, both literally and figuratively, centuries ago. In the literal sense, Baltit Fort provides a sweeping vista of the valley below, exemplifying its strategic importance for both defense and empire management. More figuratively, the fortress is a relic of the feudal Hunza state, one of several rival states in northern Pakistan at the time of its construction. Its imposing beauty was a largely symbolic message to surrounding states that the Hunza were an advanced, powerful and intelligent people. Its curious architectural roots demonstrate this symbolism to this day. As years wore on, the original structure of the fortress became more ornate as successive rulers added to and changed its appearance. In the 15th century, the Mir of Hunza at the time married a princess from Baltistan, a state closely related to Tibet, which essentially resulted in a merging of the two states culture. Architecture was no exception, and many Tibetan-style buildings appeared in Hunza valley, with a newly renovated Baltit Fort being the most prominent and enduring example. As the Hunza state advanced, moved and to some extent fell by the wayside along the march of time, the fortress fell into disrepair, teetering on the brink of ruin by the mid-20th century. At that point, the Royal Geographical Society of London and the UNESCO World Heritage foundation took notice, working with modern-day Hunza leaders to restore and preserve the fortress, turning it into a museum and cultural destination. This ensures that, for now, the beautiful and curious Baltit Fort won’t be lost to history.",

The architectural icon is both simple and striking, and it’s no wonder it’s become a symbol of the city. The mausoleum holds the remains of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. Called Quaid-e-Azam (“Great Leader”), Jinnah was the country’s 1st Governor-General. From 1913 up until Pakistan was founded in 1947, Jinnah was the leader of the All-India Muslim League within the then-British India. After World War I, Jinnah and the Muslim League increasingly advocated for a separate Muslim State. And after World War II, the Muslim League won the vote to finally establish a new country. Sadly, Jinnah died of tuberculosis a short year after the country he fought so hard to create became independent. The mausoleum his remains now lie within was designed in the 1960s. The stoic white marble structure commands attention even from afar. Lines of bubbling fountains lead toward the building, which is a pleasingly simple and striking architectural beauty. The mausoleum also holds the tombs of his sister Fatima Jinnah, the Māder-e Millat (“Mother of the Nation”) and Liaquat Ali Khan, Pakistan’s first Prime Minister.",
38,Darra Adam Khel,"Dara Adamkhel, Pakistan",A city entirely devoted to illegal gun production.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/darra-adam-khel,"The city of Darra Adam Khel is situated in Khyber Regency, south of the city of Peshawar and close to both the infamous Khyber Pass and the Afghan border. It’s generally regarded as the largest illegal gun market in the world. Seventy-five percent of the population are involved in the gun business, and gun shops seem to be the sole market keeping the city alive. Individual craftsmen produce replicas of nearly every gun on the market, from Nazi WWII pistols to modern anti-aircraft guns. Most of the shops are identical at street level and have a “shooting range“ on the roof of the building. The arms business of Darra Adam Khel came into being in 1897, and is mostly run by the local Afridi tribe. The skills used to produce these high-quality replicas are being handed from father to son, keeping the family business strong for generations. Locals take extreme pride in their gun crafting traditions. Guns from Darra Adam Khel are not only of importance to local Pakistanis, but they have also played a crucial role in the Afghans’ struggle against Soviet occupying forces. Today, a good part of the guns and ammunition used by the Taliban (in both Afghanistan and Pakistan) originate from Darra Adam Khel. Unsurprisingly, a city in which numerous rival clans and Taliban restock on ammunition and guns so close to the Afghan battlefields is not one visited by tourists. Located in a territory that the Pakistani government has no control over and where large parts of the population have strong anti-foreign sentiments, Darra Adam Khel can be rightfully regarded as one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Therefore, it’s anything but a tourist destination, despite its newfound popularity stemming from the release of the 2007 film “Son of a Lion” showcasing it. Local authorities in Peshawar actively discourage tourists from visiting. Some foreigners have managed to visit Darra Adam Khel in recently, but they have always been taken there by locals with connections in the region. The town isn’t quite as lawless as it once was, but it’s still not a good idea to try to visit on your own.","Darra Adam Khel, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan There is a checkpoint at the entrance of the Kohat Subdivision that will turn back foreigners if they attempt to enter."

Today it has some 900 members focused on promoting democratic ideals, who gather at the clubhouse watering hole in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan for debate, discussion, and drinks. The KPC headquarters includes a press conference room, library, bar, and chess room, among other facilities. Up the stairs and through a spartan room is a space that is worth vying for an invitation to. The inside of a makeshift wood panel partition is festooned with whimsical doodles by Feica, celebrated political commentator and cartoonist for Dawn, the country’s largest selling English language daily. The fabric may be fraying on the well worn sofas in the library but this is a tight-knight community pulsating with ideas and intense discussion. Overheard snippets of conversation among the old journalist “comrades” include “it was there on the lawn that I was arrested during Zia’s rule,” “a leftist state would care for all equally but I see it as a mother that will pay more attention to the child that is downtrodden,” and “if our government were secular, religion would not be able to create divisions.” The Karachi Press Club has organized countless protests against the government and rallies demanding civil and human rights over the decades, making it a sometimes controversial group to belong to. There have been attacks on the journalists themselves, the building has been vandalized, and their website has been hacked. Throughout it all though, the members hold dear the club, and what it represents.","This is the most egalitarian of members clubs, and all you have to do to get yourself an invitation to its inner sanctum is engage in earnest conversation at one of their many events, and convince the members you can spar with its most accomplished deipnosophists."

Gill then financed and oversaw the construction of a 140-foot-tall cross that towers above the entrance to Karachi’s only operational Christian cemetery. When it was finished, the behemoth monument was touted as the largest cross in Asia. Facing security concerns, Parvez did not tell even the workers the true nature of the project. They built a long squared column first, and added the outward arms of the cross toward the end of the project. When the true intent was discovered midway through construction, 20 workers quit the job. But not all of the workers stopped, making the final result a blend of Christian and Muslim efforts. Gill claims the cross is bulletproof and can withstand any damage religiously intolerant vandals may subject it to. As it’s made of steel, iron, and cement, it does seem likely the cross will be able to continue standing tall and won’t come down easy. The Gora Qabristan Cemetery (which roughly translated to “white man’s graveyard”), dates to the British colonial era. The cemetery itself is often vandalized and covered in garbage and is even home to an informal settlement situated on top of several dozens graves.",

Visitors to Liaquat Bagh, located on one of the main arteries in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, may find themselves unaware that they walk in the footprints of gruesome history. On October 16, 1951, Pakistan’s first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, was shot dead by an Afghan assailant during a public meeting of his political party here. The park was later renamed Liaquat Bagh (or Liaquat Park) in his memory. Decades later in 2007, the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, was murdered moments after addressing a political rally in the park on December 2007. She died from injuries sustained after the shooting and subsequent blast outside the venue that left 20 others dead. Both cases remain unsolved to this day and have fueled numerous conspiracy theories. In 2016, the park also hosted the funeral of convicted murderer Mumtaz Qadri, who shot governor Punjab Salman Taseer in 2011 over allegations of blasphemy. The funeral drew in thousands of religious fundamentalists who thronged the park to pay their last respects to an assassin. But a visit there today and you would never know anything happened, as no visible markers or memorials indicate its dark history. Liaquat Bagh remains a popular spot for the residents of Rawalpindi, serving as little more than an inviting park in a concrete jungle short on green space.","To avoid traffic, the park can be accessed by the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metro Bus service, which includes a stop adjacent to Liaquat Bagh."

The Hinatuan Enchanted River in Mindanao, Philippines, is a flawless saltwater river that flows into the Pacific Ocean. It is around 80-feet deep, and just barely long enough to be considered a river, yet the flow attracts visitors from around the world who want to experience the beautiful waters that locals have long thought to be miraculous. Its moniker “Enchanted River” came from a poem by Modesto Farolan. In fact, no one is sure exactly where the saltwater emanates from, although the prevailing theory involves an underground cave system that spits the river out, free of any dirt or silt which would usually cloud such a stream. Whatever the explanation, the clean waters are a natural wonder unlike any other. Local legends tell all sorts of stories about the river. One of which states that fairies added some mesmerizing colors of sapphire and jade to the river. Another legend states that the river is home to a mysterious fish that is impossible to catch. In 2017, the local government prohibited swimming in the main pool for preservation and maintenance. At the same time, they designated a swimming area some  33 feet (10 meters) away from the pool. Travelers should keep in mind that the infrastructure by the river is close to zero, thus, there are no facilities to buy medicine or food.","From the Butuan City Domestic Airport, you can take a van that goes straight to the town of Hinatuan.

They awarded a photo of the Asik-Asik waterfalls in the mountainous Alamada region, and in doing so, announced the existence of this natural wonder to the world. The picture went viral on social media, and Filipinos were stunned by this discovery. The beautiful falls had been unknown to the public for a remarkably long time; the residents of the nearby village of Sitio Dulao had only come across the site two years earlier, after a series of floods and forest fires destroyed a significant chunk of the forest that was hiding it. The newfound oasis was christened Asik-Asik, meaning “sprinkle-sprinkle” in the local Hiligaynon language, after the sprinkle of falling water on nearby rocks. Lush vegetation covers the entirety of the ravine, and adds mystery as to where the water is coming from. The most likely sources are thought to be springs deep within the mountain or an underground river. Getting to the falls is not as daunting as it used to be, after the government, sensing a wonderful tourism opportunity, developed the roads and site around it. But there are still descending and ascending treks on stairs that wind around the mountain side.

The elderly carve their own coffins out of hollowed logs. If they are too weak or ill, their families prepare their coffins instead. The dead are placed inside their coffins (sometimes breaking their bones in the process of fitting them in), and the coffins are brought to a cave for burial. Instead of being placed into the ground, the coffins are hung either inside the caves or on the face of the cliffs, near the hanging coffins of their ancestors. The Sagada people have been practicing such burials for over 2,000 years, and some of the coffins are well over a century old. Eventually the coffins deteriorate and fall from their precarious positions. The reason the coffins were hung was due to the belief that the higher the dead were placed, the greater chance of their spirits reaching a higher nature in the afterlife. Many of the locations of the coffins are difficult to reach (and obviously should be left alone out of respect), but can be appreciated from afar.","Do not touch or walk under the coffins. Bring binoculars or a telephoto camera to view these remarkable coffins from a respectful distance. From Manila, by bus or private car, travel north to Mountain Province. For commuters: you can find buses in Cubao headed directly to Sagada. The alternative is to hop on a bus headed to either Banaue or Baguio and then transfer to respective public rides bound to Sagada. During summer, it will take you about 12-13 hours to reach Sagada. During the rainy season, not only is travel time longer, but the roads also become very dangerous, and sometimes closed due to landslides."

With 33 recorded eruptions, the Taal Volcano is the second most active volcano in the Philippines and a part of the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire,” a large swath of the Pacific known for its earthquakes and active volcanoes. Despite the active seismic activity, this place is rather popular with tourists. Once at the Taal Lake shore, travelers take a boat to reach the volcano island, where they either hike up the hill or ride a horse. But the Taal Volcano is more than that. The region has some strange geological features that attract visitors from around the world. The way the features are arranged is something like nesting dolls. On the Filipino island of Luzon is Lake Taal. Within that lake is a volcano, Taal Volcano. At the top of the volcano, a thousand feet above sea level, is a basin, known as a caldera, carved out of the mountain hundreds of thousands of years ago. The caldera itself is filled with water, creating a crater lake, the largest crater lake in the world. At the center of the crater lake is a tiny island, Vulcan Point, which is one of Taal Volcano’s cones. The title of “the largest third-order island” is a short form of the logic that it’s an island within a lake, within another island, within a lake, on an island, within an archipelago, within the Pacific. On January 12, 2020, the Taal Volcano erupted, resulting in the deaths of 39 people. The eruption has caused the crater lake to dry up and disappear.

Occasionally referred to as Luluyuan Lake by locals, its crystal blue waters hidden between majestic rocky formations aren’t big on actual barracudas and other wildlife. Instead, divers can experience a thermocline and halocline unlike anywhere else. Starting out on the surface of the lake, divers, swimmers, and scuba enthusiasts can expect temperatures around 82 degrees Fahrenheit. But as you descend into the depths of the lake, around 45 to 50 feet down, the temperature drastically changes to just over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (to put that in perspective, most people keep their hot tubs at 104 degrees, so it’s best to forego a wetsuit here). This strange increase in temperature is due to the fact that the lake contains both salt and freshwater. Divers can even see the thin, distinct boundary that separates the two bodies of water. The lake is also characterized by an impressive display of limestone formations that rise up on all sides and extend beneath the surface. Divers have described a sense of “weightlessness” while exploring the hot/cool depths, and the sensorial experience (which is largely devoid of flora and fauna) has also been likened to what it must feel like to walk on the moon. But the lake holds yet another surprise: just when the salt watery heat becomes a tad unbearable, the temperature changes back to cool again near the bottom. Another unique feature of the lake is the sand at the very bottom, which has been described as “jelly-like,” “silky,” “airy,” and “silty.” It’s apparently good for play, too. And although the barracudas aren’t really around anymore, if you’re lucky, you may still catch a glimpse of one.",This lake is best experienced via scuba diving to get the full experience of the thermocline.

The Tarsier Sanctuary is a large forest dedicated to the protection of tarsiers, small nocturnal primates with big, round eyes that feed primarily on insects. They usually cling to low branches or the trunks of slim trees. Prior to the development of the sanctuaries, many tarsiers were kept as pets by private individuals in environments not conducive to their lifestyle and survival. Tarsiers are delicate, emotionally sensitive creatures that get stressed easily (and they have been known to commit suicide via banging their heads against tree trunks), so visitors have to lower their voices and keep the noise level to a minimum. Visitors are allowed to take pictures (without the flash), but touching the tarsiers is an absolute taboo. The sanctuary is officially run by the Philippine Tarsier Foundation, an organization devoted to making sure that the dwindling and delicate population survives and thrives. The park also has a store where tourists can buy t-shirts, key chains, and hats to promote the protection and preservation of the tarsiers and their habitats. Unfortunately the situation in the Philippines is obscure when it comes to organizations claiming to be tarsiers’ conservation units.

There are approximately 1,268 individual hills, their heights ranging from 100 to 160 feet, though the highest is almost 400 feet high. The hills, which are almost all symmetrical, consist of grass-covered limestone and turn brown during the dry season. Despite the abundance of hills, it is unclear how they were formed. There are multiple geological explanations ranging from oceanic volcano activity to limestone weathering. A recent theory is that an ancient volcano self-destructed and chunks of it were dispersed over the region. Numerous legends and tales also exist to explain the Chocolate Hills. One is about a giant buffalo who came and wreaked havoc in the region, eating and destroying all the crops. As an act of vengeance, locals left out spoiled crops.

During the 1980s, when the resort was new, it was called “The Golf Capital of the World,” and “Asia’s Paradise Resort”, but today it looks more like a nightmare resort. When it was at full working capacity, the massive facility had more than 300 hundred rooms spread out in little clusters that essentially formed their own village areas. The jewel of Puerto Azul, however, was the challenging and picturesque golf course, which had been designed by a legend in the sport, Gary Player. For a time it was surrounded by an air of exclusivity and opulence that was nearly unrivaled. Unfortunately, the changing tastes and trends of the rich and vacationing began to change as other resorts and golfing options opened up in the area, drawing away the customer base and making Puerto Azul seem more and more dated. The resort also ran into legal troubles, and eventually portions of the organization had to be shuttered. Although both the property’s owners and local government continually talked about revitalizing the sprawling property, nothing ever materialized. While everyone dithered, nature and time took their toll on the abandoned portions of the resort. Today Puerto Azul continues to operate, but large portions of it are abandoned and off limits to visitors. Rumors of an effort to bring the resort back to life still surface, but the many of the buildings have been irrevocably retaken by the tropical surrounds.

Despite this towering scene, what lies at the bottom of the falls leaves visitors in even greater awe. Tinago’s basin features a stunning blue-green pool of water. The colorful sheen of the water is more than enough to inspire legends of supernatural guardians that protect this aquamarine refuge. In spite of its mystic undertones, Tinago has been developed by locals to carry adventurers toward the falls. By way of a small ferry ride on one of two makeshift bamboo rafts, you can experience one of the area’s main attractions: when directly underneath the plunging falls, you can feel the therapeutic beating of the water on your skin. More than a hundred feet deep, the basin is not only a site for those who want a peaceful sanctuary, but also those who crave adventure. Thrill-seekers and adrenaline junkies are often found climbing and jumping off of the high rock walls surrounding the basin.","Tinago is under the care of the Philippine Tourism Authority. As a result, a small fee of about 50₱ (around $1) is required. Be prepared to climb up and down the ravine's more than 500 individual stairs. Bring some water to drink, you'll need it."
56,Corregidor Island,"Cavite City, Philippines",The ruins on a deserted tropical island in the Philippines bear the scars of WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/corregidor-island,"Located at the entrance to Manila Bay, “Isla ng Corregidor” was identified by the Spaniards as a strategic defense location when they arrived in the 16th century. They named it “Island of the Corrector,” since this was the place where all ships entering Manila would stop for inspection. Since then the fortress island has been the site of many battles, from the Spanish-American War to the period of American colonialism. The oldest landmark on the island is the lighthouse dated 1853, but much of this lush tropical island is dominated by ruins that reflect the intense fighting that took place in World War II. In addition to defense and battery buildings, there are shops, a movie theater, and a swimming pool, all from the soldiers stationed here many years ago. During the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, Corregidor was the temporary headquarters of the Philippine Government. American and Philippine troops fought desperately to defend the island using tunnels dug into the rock as storage for ammunition and hospitals, but without reinforcements the troops were beaten badly. Corregidor was surrendered to the Japanese by spring of 1942. In 1945 the tide of war turned against the Japanese. Enduring months of aerial and naval bombardment in the tunnels on the island, they surrendered to American and Philippine forces in February that year. Even on a bright, sunny day the place is heavy with memories of what happened here. The buildings and fortifications have been left untouched, which would give the impression that the fighting ended just yesterday if it weren’t for the greenery that has grown over in the decades since their abandonment. Tour guides on the island report they are still finding detritus from the battles of WWII. They occasionally come across objects in the jungle undergrowth dating back to even earlier, when Philippines and American families were stationed on the island at the turn of the 20th century. The expansive tunnels below ground are no doubt the eeriest part of the island. These dark corridors are allegedly haunted by Japanese soldiers who took their own lives before defeat, but whether or not you believe that legend, the tunnels are disturbing for the sheer amount of violence that occurred there. The island is now a designated national monument and war memorial. The ruins have been maintained in memory of the American, Philippine, and Japanese soldiers who fought and died here.","As it is a designated national monument access to Corregidor is by guided tour only. Tours can be arranged through Sun Cruises which depart from the pier located next to harbor square adjacent to Manila Yacht club. Departures for Corregidor island are twice daily during the week and three times on weekends. The guides are knowledgeable and very friendly, many are ex–servicemen. There is also a small hotel on the island so it is also possible to stay overnight and take advantage of the after dark tours of the island."

Worcester described mysteries and wonders of the Philippine Islands from his travels, including the tantalizing reference, “If accounts are to be believed, of a lake opening to the sea by a subterranean river.” This extraordinary river does indeed exist, snaking over five miles underground through limestone caves, linking lake to ocean in the Palawan province of the Philippines. One of the world’s longest underground waterways, the Cabayugan River passes though 15 miles of caves, studded with stalactites and stalagmites, the water rising and falling with the tides of the South China Sea at its end. The caves have been a National Park since 1971, made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999, and was named one of the “New Seven Wonders of Nature” in 2012.","The easiest for groups of people (e.g., families, friends) is to book the visit to the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River through a travel agency, whether in town or in Manila. However, it is also possible to do it yourself. There are public transport going to Sabang and back (though often it's full when going back to Puerto Princesa.

With their exact locations kept unpublicized by the government due to a a series of thefts in the 1900s, the mummies can be found only after a five hour car ride up the mountains to the villages of Kabayan, then another five hour hike up a dizzying escalation of stone steps. There the mummies stay in Timbac caves, still curled in their original coffins. Scientists believe these mummies were first created sometime by the Ibaloi tribe between 1200 and 1500 CE. Mummification began shortly before a person died, where they would ingest a very salty drink. After death, the body was washed and set over a fire in a seated position, thus drying the fluids. Tobacco smoke was blown into the mouth to dry the inside of the body and internal organs. Finally, herbs were rubbed on the body. It’s estimated that the entire process could take weeks, sometimes months, to finish. They were then buried in the caves. The practice died out in the 1500s when Spain colonized the Philippines. Today, the mummies are left in their natural caves with relatively little security and have been designated as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world. Officials know of between 50 and 80 other mummies, but they will not give their locations for fear of vandalism. Locals still pay respects to these exposed mummies with offerings such as gin and chicken dishes, ensuring the dead are well fed and are having a good time in the afterlife. A small museum in Kabayan also displays a few mummies.",
59,Old Diplomat Hotel,"Baguio, Philippines",This eerie abandoned building with a dark history is said to be one of the most haunted places in the Philippines.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haunted-diplomat-hotel,"Though it was originally built as a retreat house for friars of the Dominican Order, much of this dilapidated building’s history has been anything but peaceful. The Dominican Hill Retreat House was built in 1913 atop a hill in the famed Philippine City of Pines. With the outbreak of World War II, it became a camp for refugees escaping the Japanese army, but was eventually invaded. The Japanese secret police, the Kempeitai, committed terrible acts of brutality, massacring, raping, and torturing many of the inhabitants, and even decapitating nuns and priests. In the 1970s, the wartorn building was converted to the sophisticated and beautiful Diplomat Hotel, but the hotel was shut down by the ’80s, and left abandoned. The deserted, deteriorating building became infamous for being one of the most haunted ruins in the country. Various folklore and ghost stories surround its gray and washed-out red walls. Many people saw headless apparitions at night, and reported hearing screams, cries, banging on doors, and other strange and desperate noises. Some believe the building is haunted by the restless spirits of its grim history. The supposedly haunted ruin attracted an influx of visitors, and the old hotel is now under rehabilitation by the national government as a Heritage and Nature Park. The hotel has two floors and an accessible roof deck with a panoramic view of the city, and its west wing has been cleaned and remodeled as an event space. It’s now a place to experience both beauty and eeriness in Baguio City’s cold climate.",It is advisable to take a cab to get to the infamous ruin. Cabs are easily accessible and abundant in Baguio city. There is a small cafeteria outside of the main building for anyone who gets hungry. The site is open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The province of Pampanga is often seen as the culinary heart of the Philippines, because it is where many modern Filipino favorites originate, including the ubiquitous sisig, a sizzling plate of grilled pork face. For Atching Lillian, however, the food of Pampanga is about more than just grilled pork faces, although she does that very well, too. For Lillian, what’s important is the story, what’s important is the heritage behind Kapampangan cuisine, because tradition can add as much flavor to a dish as the spices. That’s because Lillian is more than just a chef; she’s a historian, too, and she prides herself on collecting age-old Kapampangan recipes and preparing food in as traditional a manner as possible. Most of the time, she doesn’t even use scales, because she says that her ancestors would simply throw in the ingredients, and guess the measurements. Little has changed in over a century inside her ancestral home, which also doubles as her kitchen and restaurant, and strewn around the dining hall are cooking implements that have been used by generations of chefs in Pampanga. Lillian’s signature creations are San Nicolas cookies, a religious treat dedicated to Saint Nicholas, which can trace its origins back to the arrival of Catholicism in the Spanish colonial era. Many of the wooden molds that Lillian uses to shape her famed San Nicolas cookies are well over 100 years old, and she demonstrates to her guests in the dining area just how, exactly, she makes and bakes the cookies, using a 300-year-old recipe she unearthed from archival research. Guests can even try preparing these historic cookies themselves, while they await the rest of Lillian’s reborn dishes to be served. She calls these her “Heirloom Recipes,” and everything on the menu at Lillian’s kitchen has the full force of Kapampangan history behind it. She cooks a traditional take on adobo, which, according to the recipes she’s discovered, is white, not black, because there shouldn’t be any soy sauce in the mix. She cures tough Carabao meat into a sticky, sweet-and-sour take on the cured bacon classic tocino, and she prepares Mexican-inspired tamales, which were brought to Pampanga during Spanish rule. Dining at Lillian’s home-restaurant is about more than just eating breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Lillian’s reconstructed Heirloom Recipes are all about the history, and you’ll be taken on a culinary journey stretching back hundreds of years as you gorge on Pampanga’s most traditional eats.","You'll need a reservation to enjoy the historic culinary delights of Atching Lillian's Heirloom Recipes, and for a baking demonstration of the San Nicolas cookies or any other classic dishes, you'll need to be in a party of 10 or more.  For reservations, contact Lillian through Facebook or call 09157730788. In the Kapampangan language, the restaurant is called Kusinang Matua ng Atching Lillian, or the ""Old Kitchen of Atching Lillian."""
61,Japanese Tunnels of Baguio,"Baguio, Philippines",Some locals believe the fabled lost gold of General Yamashida is hiding somewhere beneath the city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/japanese-tunnels-of-baguio,"Every summer, throngs of tourists flock to the high altitudes and commonwealth-era landmarks of Baguio, a city built over the bones of a former R&R facility for American soldiers. But running underneath many of these frequented sites are a series of tunnels built during World War II by invading Japanese forces. While most of this underground network has already been mapped out, some locals believe that somewhere beneath the former mining city lies one last treasure trove waiting for discovery: the fabled lost gold of Japanese General Yamashita. When the Philippines became an American territory in 1898, American troops and bureaucrats stationed in and around Manila were eager for ways to escape the tropical heat. Baguio’s cool mountain air and moderate temperatures made it “the summer capital” of the Philippines. The heavy American presence made the city a target when the Japanese invaded the Philippines in 1941 during WWII. During the Japanese occupation, their army built a series of tunnels under Baguio to store military supplies. Today the mouth of one of those tunnels can be found in the Baguio Botanical Garden, a dark cavern beneath a cascade of ferns and foliage. The tunnels are pitch black and dank, forming an underground loop beneath the road above. For years, rumors circulated that Baguio’s tunnels hid Yamashita’s storied stolen treasure. Rumors like these have cropped up at sites across the Philippines, borne of the vast amount of wealth looted by the Japanese. In 1945, the city played host to the formal surrender of the Japanese Imperial Forces, marking the end of WWII. And it is perhaps this historical significance that has fueled the imagination of so many visitors searching for truth behind the myth. There is perhaps a “fiction masquerading as truth” moment in the novel Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson.  The book concludes with an expedition into the mountains of the Philippines to hunt for a massive stash of gold.","The above coordinates and address are for the Baguio Botanical Garden, where you can enter and explore one of the tunnels."
62,Ursula Island,"Puerto Princesa, Philippines",This tiny island protects a number of rare bird species by only allowing visitors to set foot on the beach.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ursula-island,"A bird sanctuary with pristine white sand and not a beach resort in sight, Ursula Island is a small island located offshore from the municipality of Bataraza, in the Philippines that invites you to its shores, but forbids you from going any further. Although the Philippines is known for more famous white sand beaches such as Boracay, El Nido, and Pagudpud, there are some white sand beaches like Ursula Island which had been left free from resorts in order to protect the rare birds (mainly varieties of pigeons) which live within the tiny thatch of marshy woods in the center of the island. In fact, visitors are only allowed to visit the area after securing permits from the Provincial Environment & Natural Resources Office (PENRO) of Palawan, and even then it is forbidden to leave the beach and enter the fiercely-protected wooded area. Although this may be for the best as there are reportedly a number of snakes within. This is not to say that there is nothing to do on the island. Various activities such as shell collecting, sand castle building, playing volleyball, as well as birdwatching can be done there. Also, the island is small enough for nature walks around the entire coastline. Sadly, despite efforts to forbid resort-driven overdevelopment that has plagued other white sand beaches in the Philippines, some trash from the mainland has begun washing up on some parts of the island, posing a health risk to birds and visitors alike. Hopefully, any visitors to the island will cart out any debris they find, thus keeping the birds’ home safe.","Ride a ship to Puerto Princesa. Upon arriving at Puerto Princesa, secure necessary permissions from the Provincial Environment Office. After securing permit, search for the bus terminal that goes to the town of Bataraza (""Rio Tuba""). Upon arrival at Rio Tuba proper, ask for a tricycle man to take you to the Coral Bay port. From there, hire a boat that will take you to Ursula Island."
63,Mabua Pebble Beach,"Surigao City, Philippines",A unique beach made of a myriad of multi-sized pebbles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mabua-pebble-beach,"Mabua Pebble Beach, located 30 minutes from the city center of Surigao, is unique among many of the Filipino beaches due to its multitude of smooth white pebbles that make up its shoreline. While most beaches are formed through the movement of sediment influenced by the wind, waves and currents, Mabua Pebble Beach’s unique composition was most likely formed by very strong forward swashing waves that forced the pebble material to be driven onshore, and weaker return swashing waves that caused the material to be deposited. The countless number of smooth pebbles that make up Mabua Pebble Beach, each varying in different sizes and shapes (although the majority tend to be oval) also serve another, albeit different, purpose. Walking barefoot on the smooth stones, according to reflexologists, has a strong impact on the body, as the feet have reflex points that are connected to our internal organs, making this beach both stunning and therapeutic.","Mabua Pebble Beach can be reached via a 30-minute drive from the city center. Get off at the Mt. Bagarabon Mountain Resort and make your way past their Hajahay Suites towards the pebble shore. There are the carved steps off the side of a small hill, climb the steps and on the other side of the hill is the pebble beach. If you don't prefer to walk, you may rent a banca (small fishing boat) to take you to the pebble beach."

Over a thousand people were killed in the disaster, including hundreds who sought refuge in the stone church during the eruption, but were tragically engulfed by the fast-flowing volcanic matter. The belfry and parts of the facade are all that remained of the 16th-century Cagsawa church after the eruption, but the facade collapsed over time, leaving only the old bell tower standing today. It is now joined by a wooden cross that was placed where the church altar used to be. Today, the Cagsawa ruins are one of the most popular tourist attractions in Albay province, as they are set against the magnificent backdrop of their very maker, the Mayon Volcano. Equal parts historic and scenic, the site, now named Cagsawa Ruins Park, was even declared a national cultural treasure.","Cagsawa Ruins Park is located just outside the city of Daraga in Albay Province. As a popular attraction, the site has plenty of food, souvenirs, and activities, such as ATVs rides that take visitors closer to the volcano.

Although he was forced to include metal stops in the organ to retain its sound, every other piece was built entirely out of bamboo, creating a unique instrument. Cera was a Spanish priest, stationed in the Philippines, and began building the organ out of practical concerns. Bamboo was everywhere near Manilla, and classic organ materials were hard to come by. The result of his work and the environment, was an organ built in the Spanish style but with an Asian twist. Immediately after its construction, the church and organ were assailed by mother nature. Earthquakes and flooding struck regularly and Father Cera was forced to begin restoration on the organ shortly after he finished building it. After his death, the organ went into a serious period of decline, even becoming unplayable during the early 21st century and after World War II. Finally, in 1972 a move to restore the organ back to its original luster was undertaken by European contractors. Today, not only is the organ playable, but it is the centerpiece of a concert called the Bamboo Organ Festival. With its strange construction, the Bamboo Organ has become a legend for organists around the world, who travel across the world to stroke the bamboo keys.",Accessible by taxi from Manila

Yet one stretch of beach remains untouched, because just 20 feet beyond the pristine waters, behind a curtain of foliage, lie nearly 100 concrete graves. A thick brush of grass and thorny weeds carpet the cemetery floor, making it nearly impossible to move through without climbing upon the tight grid of six-foot-long concrete blocks. The cemetery holds  the deceased loved ones of the residents of Maricaban, the municipality of Tingloy, and its surrounding areas. When the cemetery was first founded, it was set about 1,600 feet (500 meters) from the shore, far away from the waves, but due to rising tides, the dearly departed now have beachfront real estate. Locals even tell of how a storm flooded the cemetery not too long ago, dragging some remains out with the tide. Today, no evidence of these remains exists among the crystal clear waters of Maricaban.

67,Manila North Cemetery,"Manila, Philippines","A cemetery home to 10,000 living residents.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/manila-north-cemetery,"The vast Manila North Cemetery stretches across 100 acres in the packed city of Manila. But this cemetery isn’t a scene of peaceful serenity, so much as bursting with life, the smells of cooking, and children running underfoot. That’s because the cemetery has been home to an ever increasing population of living residents for over 70 years. Currently home to a population of more than 10,000 Filipinos, in between the headstones and crypts one finds food carts, kids playing dice atop a 150 year old grave, and businesses run from inside a family mausoleum. Originally home to poor caretakers, who began living there year round, the population grew as poor people who could no longer afford their rent moved into their family crypts, often sharing space with the deceased remains of parents and grandparents. The cemetery has been home to poor Filipinos for long enough that there are 60-year-olds who were born, and have lived their entire lives, in the cemetery. The cemetery is a thriving hidden city, where the residents form a sort of symbiotic relationship with the dead. To make money, children carry coffins (also said to bring them good luck) for 50 cents, and collect scrap metal, while their parents work to clean the crypts of the wealthier areas, work security, or dig graves. They often run local businesses from within their mausoleums/crypts. Nonetheless, the cemetery is no easy place to live, lacking hot water, electricity, and any kind of functional sewage system. Recently, there have been complaints from both residents and visitors that a bad element has moved in, such as thieves and drug addicts who are robbing the graves. In 2007 the Mayor threatened to evict the entire neighborhood. One group that does regularly get evicted is the dead. If you aren’t wealthy enough to have your own space you are buried at the edge of the cemetery and dug up after five years and your bones are stacked in charnel houses. This also happens to anyone who can’t afford their familiy’s mausoleum rent. However in doing so it also makes room for new comers, be they living, dead, or a mix.",

The Tangbo River, which the falls are connected to, is rich in calcium. This gives the rock, and water, at Aguinid Falls a slightly green hue, and makes the water a bit warmer than at other falls. Which is good because a proper trip to Aguinid Falls means getting wet. To see the falls in its entirety, visitors will have to do some climbing and wading through the falls’ five levels, six if you count level zero. Plan accordingly and wear something to swim in and bring zip lock bags/waterproof cases for cameras, phones, etc. With its alien beauty, Aguinid stands out among the many waterfalls that attract visitors to the south of Cebu. Though it does not have the intimidating height like the more popular (and crowded) Kawasan Falls an hour away, its humble and hidden nature give it special charm. There’s an entrance fee of Php10 (less than $1) which goes towards maintaining the area. There are also guides available at the entrance. Important to note, the guides at Aguinid serve voluntarily, and are not paid a set fee, so tipping is the nice thing to do.

After the Spanish-American War, America needed to beef up their defenses around many of their newly acquired territories such as Manila Bay. To this end, it was decided that instead of stationing precious naval forces in the harbor, a permanent defense platform would be established on the tiny rock known as El Fraile Island. The island was leveled out and built back up almost from scratch with reinforced concrete, and cast in the basic shape of a massive battleship. To complete the look, two enormous gun batteries were installed on the island. There was even a wooden barracks built on the new island, but this was removed to give the swiveling guns a fuller range of motion. The faux-ship was highly defensible and struck an imposing silhouette to enemies. Unfortunately the base was taken by Japanese forces during World War II and was held until 1945 when American troops moved to retake Manila. After securing the troops outside the fort, the Americans simply poured oil and gasoline into the base and set it alight, obliterating the remaining enemy troops and starting a fire which burned inside the base for days. After retaking Manila, the war torn Fort Drum was simply abandoned, leaving the burnt out base and its towering guns to slowly rust away like an immovable ghost ship.",

Its tale traces a long story of occupation, struggle, and survival—much like the tale of the country’s rise and wane under Imperial Spain. The coastal Ilocos Region of northwestern Philippines was home to the native Ilocano ethnic group and served as a trading port for the nearby Malaysian and Indonesian tribal peoples. Being over a thousand kilometers from the Visayan Islands, the first point of entry for the Spaniards in 1521, this northern region was a rather peculiar place for Spain to establish a stronghold. Yet after 333 years of Spanish rule over the archipelago, the cultural and religious traditions of Spain are still practiced in the region and many other parts of the Philippines today. Along with these intangible transformations are the indestructible structures that have withstood the test of time. Structures like the famed Sinking Bell Tower, the tallest historic building in Laoag City, the capital of Northern Ilocos. One of the first oddities a visitor may notice is the tower’s distance from the city’s main cathedral, St. William’s. Bell towers are commonly built “attached” to cathedrals or a few meters away, but for reasons unknown, St. William’s bell tower was built about 80 meters from its doors. The bell tower was presumably built after the 1707 earthquake. It has withstood several minor earthquakes since completion, thus earning membership to the “Earthquake Baroque” style label by architecture scholars, along with several churches across the Philippines and Guatemala. It was locally constructed by Ilocano artisans who used bricks joined by molasses and leaves from a local plant named sablot. With a foundation of 295 feet and a height of nearly 150 feet, it was a solid structure that towered over Ilocanos for centuries. Maybe not for too much longer. It is believed that the tower is sinking at a rate of an inch every year. There aren’t any conclusive scientific explanations for this, but one accepted theory is that the tower being built on sandy land and its heavy and massive structure is causing it to slowly bury itself into the ground. Stories from the past tell of people mounted on horses being able to pass through the tower’s gates. However, if you visit the bell tower today, you would realize you would have to almost crawl through its gates to enter the bell tower. (Unfortunately, the city council strictly prohibits unauthorized entry into its prized piece of history.) Today, the bell tower is also sinking in a figurative way. The booming city of Laoag continues to undergo tremendous structural changes. The cathedral itself was recently repainted beige and yellow (much to the locals’ dismay), but the old, gray sinking bell tower still stands, tarnished only by the passing of time.",You can get to the Sinking Bell Tower easily from anywhere in the city by hailing a tricycle.

Filipinos make the journey to Banahaw’s slopes in an effort to restore their vitality and spiritual health. Belief in its powers draws pilgrims from all over the country year-round, culminating in huge gatherings and en masse rituals during Holy Week (Easter). Myths and stories of visions and miracles have sprung forth from Banahaw for many years, ever since a local man proclaimed to have heard “holy voices” that led him to numerous natural springs. It’s said that those who bathe in the water from the springs will have good fortune and, in some cases, the ability to see their future. The many caves that run deep into the rock are said to also hold their own kind of spiritual power. According to the lore, the Cave of Judgement is a spot to head to if you’ve lost count of your sins and need a guilt-inducing reminder of just how badly you’ve behaved in the past. It’s said that entering the cave will strike a scar for every sin you’ve committed, but if you manage to leave its murky depths unscathed, then you’re doing well and your sins are few. The Rizalista cult has long resided at the foot of Banahaw. They’re a peaceful group who hold folk Catholic beliefs regarding the national hero, Jose Rizal, who they revere as God. The Rizalista temples found in the villages around the mountain are colorful monuments to their beliefs and a physical reminder of the mountain’s spiritual power.

74,Lion's Head,"Baguio, Philippines","Just off the road outside Baguio, a gigantic lion's head carved into a mountain greets those driving by.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lions-head,"Kennon Road serves as an important artery to Baguio City, sometimes called the summer capital of the Philippines with an elevation of 1,500 meters (4,921 feet). This mountainous region is punctuated by large boulders and when the road was first built, passersby observed a particular limestone that resembled the shape of a lion’s head. In the late 1960s, a local club decided to make that resemblance more literal. Members of the Lions Club of Baguio wanted the rock to become a landmark. They prepared the limestone, and sculptor Anselmo B. Day-ag carved into it a more realistic depiction of a lion’s head with a large mane and open mouth. Unveiled in 1972, the Lion’s Head measures 40 feet (12 meters) in height. It is painted in shades of gold, black, and brown—though at various points over the years it has been painted in other colors. Today Lion’s Head is a popular stop for those passing by the highway to Baguio or heading back to the lowland regions.","Located in Camp 6 near the Baguio–Tuba boundary,"
75,Gardens by the Bay,Singapore,Singapore's landscaping project is home to 18 incredible Supertrees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gardens-by-the-bay,"Along Singapore’s Marina Bay, a landscaping project known as Gardens by the Bay hopes to beautify the marina and help transform the dense city-state into a “city in the garden.” But with futuristic design features that border on otherworldly, this garden is unlike any you’ve seen before. Due to their sheer height and fantastical appearance, Gardens by the Bay’s defining feature is almost certainly its collection of 18 “Supertrees.” With heights ranging from 80 to 160 feet and light displays that come alive at night, the Supertrees complement the nearby high-rises and add distinctive flair to the Singapore skyline. As you may have guessed, these trees are not trees in the traditional sense, but rather a series of man-made frames which house both greens and green technology. Roughly 200 species of orchids, ferns, and other tropical climbers scale the Supertrees’ trunks, forming a lush, colorful skin. In some regards the Supertrees imitate the functions of regular trees: absorbing and redistributing heat, collecting and filtering rainwater, and providing shade with their expansive canopies. Eleven of the trees are outfitted with either solar panels, which power the Supertree Grove’s lighting displays, or ventilation systems used to capture exhaust from the park’s greenhouses. Visitors can get an up-close look at these mechanical marvels from a 72-foot-high walkway known as the OCBC Skyway. The Supertrees, though probably the park’s most visually commanding features, are by no means the only impressive attraction at Gardens by the Bay; the garden complex is also home to two enormous greenhouses, as well as several outdoor gardens and lakes. The Flower Dome supports thousands of varieties of cool-dry climate plants and flowers, while the nearby Cloud Forest fosters plants that prefer wet conditions found on mountains and tropical highlands. Both of these greenhouses use sustainable technologies to minimize the their environmental impact. In addition to incorporating elements of the natural world into Singapore’s city life, Singapore’s government hopes the project will attract ecotourists from around the world.","While there is an entrance fee for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, the outdoor gardens including the Supertree Grove are free. Don’t miss the spectacular light and sound show that takes place at the Supertree Grove at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. every night. The gardens are open 5:00 a.m.-2:00 a.m. daily, but are not illuminated in the early morning. The Supertree lights are turned off at midnight."
76,Singapore's Rooftop Pool,Singapore,The largest pool at its elevation sits on top of one of the most expensive resorts in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/singapore-rooftop-pool,"The Singapore skyline boasts the largest swimming pool of any other skyline in the world. The massive pool sits on the 57th floor, above the three 55-story high hotel towers of the Marina Bay Sands Resort, an integrated resort property whose construction project was the most expensive of its kind. The design, conceptualized by the resort’s architect Moshe Safdie, was inspired by a deck of playing cards, appropriate, as one of the hotel’s main attractions is its large casino. The pool’s vanishing edge gives the appearance of an abrupt cut-off at 650 feet in the air; however, just below the top edge is another trough-like basin which catches the water and returns it to the main pool. Measuring 478 feet long, almost three Olympic swimming pools in length, the SkyPark pool is the world’s largest infinity-edge pool at that height. There is also a restaurant, bar, spa, and botanical garden with 250 species of trees and 650 plants, and an observation deck which costs 23 SGD (or around 18 USD) to enjoy.",Please note you cannot swim or relax at the poolside unless you are a hotel guest.

77,Haw Par Villa,Singapore,A Buddhist theme park brings you a Buddhist version of Hell.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haw-par-villa,"Mentioning Haw Par Villa to Chinese Singaporeans may raise an eyebrow or two, and will likely lead to a conversation about how they were forced to go there as children in order to learn about good morals, the consequences of their actions, and to see the horrors they may face in the afterlife, should they stray. Casually referred to as a “Buddhist amusement park”, Haw Par Villa is actually a very graphic and educational journey through the hodgepodge of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism that constitute the traditional fabric of Chinese life, legend, spirituality and morality – along with a smattering of references to Singaporean history and their relationship to the world around them – spelled out in greater than life-size plaster dioramas. The villa was created in 1937 as “Tiger Balm Gardens” by Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, the makers of the medicinal ointment known as Tiger Balm, as a way to give back to the community and to pass on the beliefs and values of Chinese culture to the uninitiated. After many years of additions – many were dubious and short lived – and changes (some statues were moved to the Chinese Garden in western Singapore), the sprawling grounds still feature hundreds of huge dioramas (some of which are large enough to walk into), and over a thousand wonderfully rendered statues. As you walk through the park you will come across a beautiful koi and turtle pond that is a great spot to take a break, feed the fish and relax amongst the bridges, pagodas and, incongruously, the Statue of Liberty. You can easily spend an entire afternoon losing yourself in this plaster maze of mythology posing with the Monkey King and Sumo wrestlers, or the very, very bloody battle between rabbits and rats, but be mindful to save some time for the highlight of your trip: Buddhist Hell. Loosely based on Buddhist notions of Hell, the Ten Courts of Hell Cave uniquely illustrates the cultural synthesis of Buddhist and other mythologies that is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. viewable in all of its surrealistic beauty and spooky lighting. You will be treated to a very graphic, up close and personal account of what you have to look forward to as a result of your transgressions in this life. Not to give any of it away, but who knew being reincarnated was so involved, or so brutal? A walk back to feed the turtles may be in order after this, or maybe a visit to the gift shop. Tiger Balm soothes all aches…","Taxi: A quick ride from downtown, but it's also a straight shot from HarbourFront MRT (NE1), which makes it an easy side trip if you plan on visiting VivoCity or Sentosa. Train: A MRT stop on the Circle Line named Haw Par Villa (CC25) takes you to the front gate. Bus: Take SBS Transit bus 200 from Buona Vista MRT Station (EW21), SBS Transit bus 10, 30, SMRT Bus 188 from HarbourFront Centre, SBS Transit bus 143 from Orchard Road, SBS Transit bus 51 from Chinatown, or SBS Transit bus 175 from Clementi MRT Stn/Temporary Bus Interchange.

78,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum,Singapore,This $62 million dollar temple was erected to house one little dental fragment of religious history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buddha-tooth-relic-temple-museum,"Completed in 2007, this $62 million complex is a popular tourist attraction in Singapore’s vibrant Chinatown. That may seem like quite an investment to honor a fragment of bone, but the tooth purportedly belongs to one of the most famous religious figures in history—the Buddha. The temple claims that the tooth is a relic recovered in 1980 from a collapsed stupa in Myanmar, but little additional information has been provided. Experts have called into question the authenticity of the tooth, saying that it is most likely “the tooth of a cow or water buffalo, but definitely not a human.” The tooth is located on the fourth story of the temple in the Sacred Light Chamber. It is only available for viewing during certain hours, so be sure to check the website before you go. Photography is strictly forbidden inside the relic chamber. Even if you miss the tooth, the temple itself is very impressive, featuring multiple floors of buddha statues, nagas (the popular Southeast Asian dragon-snakes that guard sacred relics), and impressive ceremonial venues in which to pray and meditate. There are a handful of other temples that claim to have tooth relics, including the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka.",
79,Hawker Chan Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle,Singapore,This Singaporean food-court stall was home to the world's cheapest Michelin-starred meal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hawker-chan-soya-sauce-chicken-rice-and-noodle,"To eat a Michelin-starred meal in Singapore, one of the most expensive places in the world, you’ll usually need a reservation and a week’s pay. For Chan Hon Meng’s soya sauce chicken rice, you’ll need $3. Do expect to stand in line for an hour or two, though. The Malaysian-born chef dropped out of school at 15 to help his parents on their pig, duck, and vegetable farm. He decided he wanted to work in the kitchen in his 20s, and began training in Hong Kong. The techniques and recipes he learned there became the cornerstone of the food-court stall he opened with his wife, Irene, in Singapore in 2009. Every day, he makes his secret Cantonese-style, soya sauce–based marinade from scratch (without divulging all of its ingredients, he concedes to adding Chinese angelica roots, cloves, coriander, and star anise). He marinates 180 chickens overnight before braising and hanging them in his stall-front before service opens. The accompanying rice is fried in chicken fat and boiled in chicken stock. While he sells char siew noodles, pork rib, and hor fun noodles, the chicken is his stall’s major draw. When Michelin representatives phoned Meng in 2016, inviting him to the Michelin Guide Singapore Gala Dinner, he thought they were kidding. The representative insisted that the awards were selected based on food rather than venue. With that, Meng’s stall became the home of the world’s most affordable Michelin-starred meal. In the year after earning his star, he opened a full restaurant in the mall next to the food court, as well as several others, as far away as Thailand and Taiwan, with plans slated for Melbourne, as well. While he has aspirations to sell his chicken around the world, he refuses to compromise on its accessibility and flavor, hoping each plate of chicken tastes exactly as it does in the original humble food court stall that won him culinary acclaim.",
80,Henderson Waves,Singapore,The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore looks like a series of undulating waves rising between two public parks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/henderson-waves,"The city-state of Singapore is the greenest city in Asia according to the Green City Index. The green cover of the so-called Garden City is almost at 50 percent, and the lush environments are supported by a focus on renewable energy and future sustainability. Part of this interconnected system is the Southern Ridges, a 6.2-mile (10-kilometer) trail in the south of the city. And this is where you’ll find the Henderson Waves, the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. The idea for the Southern Ridges was conceived in 2002. Its aim was to connect a series of parks located along the southern ridge of Singapore, with one trail running between the Mount Faber, Telok Blangah Hill, and Kent Ridge parks and the Labrador Nature Reserve. To achieve this, local authorities commissioned a number of architecturally striking pedestrian bridges and walkways to connect the different green spaces, at a cost of S$25.5 million (US $18.5 million). The Henderson Waves, completed in 2008, is the most impressive of all the bridges along the trail. It connects Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park, stretching for 899 feet (274 meters) and reaching a height of 118 feet (36 meters) above Henderson Road. The bridge’s most notable feature is its organic wave-like design. The walkway itself is formed by slats of yellow Balau wood, sourced from certified sustainable timber farms in East Malaysia, and around this flow the “waves.” The waves are formed by seven undulating curved steel ribs that at various stages rise over or beneath the walkway. In some sections, the wave flows high over the bridge forming alcoves that provide sheltered seating areas for passing pedestrians. The bridge was designed to integrate with the green areas around it. At the same time, it was made with multifunctionality in mind. Not only does it connect two green spaces, it also provides a recreational experience in its own right. It’s a popular destination for joggers and walkers, as well as couples and families who come to sit in the shaded alcoves. People come to enjoy the panoramic views of the city, harbor, and Southern Islands, while bird watchers walk the bridge to spot the various birds that can be seen in the surrounding canopy. And at night a different experience awaits. Every day between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. the bridge is illuminated with LED lights, creating a wave of light that flows through the Singapore night.","Henderson Waves is located in the south of Singapore. It crosses over Henderson Road and connects Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park. You can get there by taking the bus (number 145) to the stop on Henderson Road right beneath the bridge. From here you’ll find a staircase going up to the bridge. Alternatively, you can get the bridge from Mount Faber. From the cable car station on Faber Peak, it’s a 15 to 20 minute walk to Henderson Waves."
81,Changi Airport Slides,Singapore,The busy transport hub is home to the tallest airport slide in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/changi-airport-slides,"“Fun” is a rarely used adjective when it comes to air travel, but Changi Airport has long endeavored to change that. With above-and-beyond amenities such as a rooftop swimming pool and an indoor jungle space known as the Jewel, it’s no surprise that the transport hub was voted the best of its kind in Skytrax’s 2019 World Airport Awards—a title that Changi has held on to for seven consecutive years. Among Changi Airport’s most functional wonders are two giant slides that send travelers to their gates with as much speed as amusement. Unveiled in Terminal 3 in 2010, the original slide towers over 39 feet high across four stories as the tallest slide in Singapore and a record-holder among airports. With dims yet to be confirmed, the newer of the two slides is located in Terminal 4, and empties out near a five-story netted play area known as the “Red Chandelier.” But it’s not all fun and games—terms and conditions apply. In order to access either slide, travelers have to have spent a minimum of $10 at a shop or restaurant in Changi Airport that day, and passengers can redeem up to 10 joyrides within 24 hours. For those who skew toward the traditional, stairs and escalators are still a classic means of reaching each gate.","The slides are open to travelers between 12 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. The $10 that passengers are required to have spent in the airport excludes medical clinics, Crowne Plaza Hotel fees, currency exchange fees, and a Jewel cash card. In order to gain access to the Changi Airport slides, participants must be between four and six and a half feet tall."

The menagerie is surprisingly colorful and diverse with varieties such as the long-necked snake-headed turtles, the otherworldy mata-mata, and the regal golden soft-shell turtle. The hard-shelled reptiles are spread out in pools, ponds, and tanks where visitors can view the living specimens. There are vegetables for purchase to feed the creatures, but anyone wishing to get up close and personal with the turtles is advised that they may mistake your fingers for carrots. In addition to the zoo collection, the museum has thousands of terrapin-shaped ceramics, dishes, furniture pieces, and knick-knacks of all sorts.

83,Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,Singapore,This rare wildlife haven in Singapore feels like you're in the tropical rainforest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sungei-buloh-wetland-reserve,"Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a fresh spark of natural greenery and rich biodiversity, something which is largely uncommon in Singapore. The unique rustic charm is especially beautiful around the mangrove areas. In many ways, it almost feels like you’re entering the tropical rainforest of Malaysia or Indonesia. But in fact you are here in the far northwestern area of Singapore in a unique wildlife haven. Sungei Buloh, Singapore’s first ASEAN Heritage Park, has its trails pass through coastal areas, forest trails, mid-canopy walks and migratory bird trails. The entire route covers the distance of 3,700 meters. The reserve is an important stopover point for over 150 species of exotic migratory birds from as far as Alaska, Siberia, Northern China and Australia, making this an important ecological site forming the East Asian Australasian Shorebird Site Network. Other than migratory birds, many distinctive fauna can be found along the wetland. One of the most frequent animal sightings is the infamous Malayan water monitor lizard, which is huge enough that some people confuse them with the Komodo dragon. For expert guidance, learn and explore with experienced guides by joining the free guided walks that are conducted at the reserve every weekend.","- The best way to get to Sungei Buloh is by boarding Kranji Express from Kranji MRT Station, which operates 8.30-17.45 everyday.
- Migratory birds are best spotted during September-March period. Make sure you bring a binocular so that you can observe these unique birds from a respectful distance.
- Singapore's well-conditioned and hygienic indoor environment may make you forget that it's still in Southeast Asia after all. Humid, hot environment is to be expected in Sungei Buloh, so wear breathable clothes and bring insects repellent."
84,World's First Salmon ATM,Singapore,"Frozen in Norway, vended in Singapore.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-first-salmon-atm,"In January of 2019, a new ATM was unveiled in Singapore’s Wisteria shopping mall. Instead of cash, however, this machine dispenses 200-gram fillets of frozen salmon from the fjords of Norway. Today, dozens of salmon ATMs dot the island city-state. Manish Kumar, founder and CEO of Norwegian Salmon Pte Ltd, has a stated goal of making his beloved salmon available to all and affordable for everyone. By cutting out the cost of storefronts, staff, and distributors, he’s able to sell his fillets for S$5.90 ($4.25). And by holding them under -4 degrees F in each vending machine, the fish stays fresh for up to two years. Thanks to promising first quarter sales, though, it’s unlikely any fillets will stick around that long. The company decided on Singapore because of the country’s vending-machine culture (Singaporean machines vend everything from ice cream to luxury cars) and affection for Norwegian salmon. With locations in shopping malls, commercial areas, housing condominiums, and suburban areas, Norwegian salmon is now available to salmon-loving Singaporeans in 61 locations, 24/7. In an interview with RiceMedia, Kumar noted, with apparent satisfaction, “There have been many cases where customers buy salmon after midnight.”","The ATMs do not take cash, and the fish is dispensed frozen. The original ATM is located on the first floor of the Wisteria Mall."
85,House of Tan Teng Niah,Singapore,"This house is one of the most colorful in the country, and is the last remaining example of a historic villa.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-tan-teng-niah,"This vividly colorful house was constructed in 1900 by a local businessman named Tan Teng Niah. At the time, the neighborhood was an industrial zone (Tan’s candy and rubber factories were located nearby) and many of Singapore’s ethnic-Chinese businessmen lived in similar villas. Amid Singapore’s rapid economic growth and social change during the 20th century, the neighborhood evolved into what is now known as Little India. Most of the old merchant houses were razed to make way for modern commercial buildings and sleek skyscrapers. However, the Tan Teng Niah house survived, and during the 1980s, it underwent a full restoration to what people see today. Believed to be the last such house in existence, it’s now preserved under landmark status from the National Heritage Board. Although the house’s historical background is interesting, the key to its popularity among locals and visitors is its current appearance. The exterior is painted in a rainbow riot of vivid colors, with every element—each individual slat, molding, panel, and pilaster—in a different hue than its neighbor. An array of sky blue, avocado green, traffic-cone orange, highlighter yellow, and nail-polish pink shades adorns the house. Further embellishments beyond the psychedelic color-palette include gilded Chinese calligraphy, intricate floral lunettes, and a bamboo-tiled roof. The house is now used as a commercial space, and recent tenants have included a pharmacy and a business training school. Quite the ordinary activities, within one of the most extraordinary buildings in Singapore.","The house of Tan Teng Niah is located at 37 Kerbau Road, a block away from Little India MRT Station."
86,Katong Antique House,Singapore,This jam-packed Singapore antique museum preserves the fading remnants of a uniquely mixed culture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/katong-antique-house,"Decorated with intricately painted green tiles and painted a cheery yellow, the Katong Antique House is a treasure trove of Peranakan antiques. The two-storied shop house is located in Katong area in the east of Singapore, where many old Peranakan families live. Run by Mr. Peter Wee, a fourth generation Peranakan, the Katong Antique House is more than a museum for Baba-Nyonya artifacts and a shop selling Peranakan goods, it is a tableau of the Peranakan presence in Singapore. The Peranakans refer to the descendants of Chinese who immigrated to the Malayan Peninsula and the Indonesia Archipelago between the 13th and 15th century. These immigrants adopted some Malay customs and traditions while retaining some of their own; some say they retained the original Chinese traditions much better than the Chinese who remained in China as they were unaffected by the eradication of culture during the Cultural Revolution. They eventually went on to develop their own culture and language based on that of their adopted countries. When Singapore was colonized in 1819, some Peranakans moved to the tiny island state and befriended the English colonialists, thus beginning their history in Singapore which Mr. Peter Wee has spent his life striving to preserve. Adorning the walls of the old shophouse inherited from Wee’s maternal grandfather are Peranakan prints and portraits. Peranakan crockery, costumes, and furniture fill the space. The influences and origins of the Peranakan culture are evident in these antiques. The baju panjangs (long dress) and batik sarongs are reminiscent of the native Malay dresses. The intricate kasot manek, handmade shoes with beaded designs, have beautiful motifs of fish, flowers, phoenixes and dragons, similar to the motifs found in Chinese designs. These motifs are found all over the furniture in the store, in the legs of tables and sides of cupboards, each associated with something the Chinese value like prosperity, fertility, longevity and wealth. Wee has dedicated most of his life salvaging these treasures from the bins of Peranakan families whose young do not know of their family histories. His small museum-store preserves the remnants of Peranakan heritage abandoned by the unsentimental nature of the modern local. If you are ever in Singapore, this place is a must for those wishing to examine an integral part of Singapore history before it fades into history.",
87,Keppel Hill Reservoir,Singapore,A former reservoir that was only recently discovered after more than 60 years of disuse.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/keppel-hill-reservoir,"Situated on a small hill that leads up to Mt Faber, the abandoned Keppel Hill Reservoir serves as a hidden sanctuary for thrill-seekers and urban explorers. Although its origins are unknown, it dates back more than a century, yet was absent from official maps for decades until it came to the attention of the National Heritage Board and local media in 2014. Roughly one-third the size of an Olympic swimming pool, the enclosed body of water once served the needs of nearby residents, although its use shifted from hydration to swimming and leisure. The remnants of a diving board are still visible, and maps from the era of Japanese Occupation label the area as a swimming pool. Just as the reservoir may have brought bouts of laughter and enjoyment, it was also the site of some tragedy: Newspaper reports from the mid-1900s note several deaths due to drowning. Emerging out of the jungle, the reservoir feels like a secret, if not a fairy tale. Nonetheless, it fell into disuse, possibly because its paltry size made it an ineffective water source. Today it is overrun by vegetation and overhanging branches that can exude a menacing aura. Still, the Keppel Hill Reservoir is evidence that much remains to be discovered even in the dense urban jungle that is Singapore, and that such landscapes still exist in the liminal space between public consciousness and history.","From Harbourfront MRT station, a 15-minute walk will take you to Wishart Rd. Turn right and walk up Keppel Hill. At the fork, take a left and follow the stone path all the way into the foliage where you will be greeted by the sight of the Keppel Hill Reservoir. Turning right at the fork would lead you to 11 Keppel Hill, which was formerly known as Keppel House. While the site is in a public park, local authorities advise caution when exploring, as the reservoir has not been prepared for visitors and has potential to support wildlife. As of 2019, the organization My Heritage offers a tour that includes a visit to the reservoir."
88,Bukit Brown Cemetery,Singapore,One of the largest Chinese cemeteries outside of China spent years overgrown and forgotten.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bukit-brown-cemetery,"While exact numbers are not available, an estimated 100,000 people lie buried within the 0.86 square kilometers (212 acres) that comprise Bukit Brown Cemetery. However, final resting places are not so final in this crowded city-state, and now this unique cemetery set aside for Singapore’s Chinese residents faces disruption to meet the relentless demands of development. Originally owned by private Chinese clans for burials, the site became an official municipal cemetery in 1922. However, the new plots sat dormant for months despite the pressing need for burial grounds, as the Europeans that laid out the cemetery did not take into account the feng shui requirements of Chinese burial plots and thus had to re-plot much of the land. As several million Chinese migrants either passed through or settled in Singapore, Bukit Brown Cemetery is a significant feature of the city’s cultural history. Many famous Singaporeans (of all classes and statuses) are buried there, drawing from very diverse origins including Hokkien, Hainanese, Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew. The tombs range from the tiny to the impressively grand. Beautiful, unique Peranakan tiles adorn many of the graves, attracting attention and study from ceramic experts from around the world. Laying largely dormant since 1973, Bukit Brown Cemetery has become overgrown and forgotten. Now that construction of an eight-lane highway promises to necessitate the exhumation and relocation of thousands of bodies, efforts are underway to plot and record all of the cemetery’s residents. This is, however, a difficult task, as documentation is very limited, and new tombs are still being discovered. In addition, Bukit Brown Cemetery is also known for its lush greenery which serves as a home for a wide array of animals such the Changeable Hawk Eagle, the Large Flying Fox and other threatened species. The Friends of Bukit Brown (aka the “Brownies”) are working hard to raise awareness about this precious cultural heritage site.","Bukit Brown MRT Station is easy to get to. Wear pants if you want to explore; the bulk of the place is untended, overgrown grounds. Wear sunscreen and bug spray and bring lots of water. Watch out for stray dogs."
89,CHIJMES,Singapore,A historical convent known for taking in bad luck babies left on its doorstep is now an upscale shopping center.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chijmes,"The bustling civics district of Singapore contains a plethora of historical and religious sites that have been converted into museums and galleries for tourism and heritage purposes. The one site that stands out most is the CHIJMES (pronounced as “chimes”) said to be Singapore’s version of London’s Covent Gardens. Designed by George Coleman, CHIJMES (Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus Middle Education School) is a huge complex of buildings of great architectural diversity, ranging from Anglo French Gothic to Neoclassical. All over the complex are intricately designed metal staircases, handmade stained glass windows and tall grand spires. Although CHIJMES has features of such grandeur, its beginnings were more humble than what its exterior would suggest. CHIJMES started out as a convent school set up in 1854 by French nuns of the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, a religious institute of Religious Sisters founded by the French Minim friar, Father Nicholas Barré. At the request of Father Beurel the priest of the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, the institute sent a group of nuns to set up a school for girls in Penang and Singapore. The Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus had a mission to help the disadvantaged in this South East Asian island. It served as a school, pioneering education for girls in a time when many locals were poor and education for girls was not considered important. It also served as an orphanage as many poor families could not afford to keep all their children. One of the most famed features of the former convent is the modest Gate of Hope. While the small grey door may seem less grand than expected, it was a symbol of hope for many of the babies who were left there. Due to poverty, many families left usually female babies there for the nuns of the convent to care for. Female babies born in the Year of the Tiger were also often abandoned there as well by Chinese families who believed that female Tiger babies brought bad luck. These orphans were given a free education and home within the walls of this convent. Another famed feature would be the first building of the complex, Caldwell House which originally served as the residence of a Senior Magistrate’s Clerk before being bought by the sisters to serve as their headquarters. The other buildings were added around it in later years to become what was colloquially known as the Town Convent. However part of the original nuns’ quarters was demolished to make way for SMRT(Singapore Mass Rapid Transit) offices. Even though the nuns eventually moved out of the school in 1984, they did not stop helping the disadvantaged and educating the girls of Singapore. Before their final year in the Town Convent, the nuns had set up various convents for primary and secondary education all over Singapore, each bearing the name of the Holy Infant Jesus, from CHIJ St Nicholas to CHIJ Kellock in the years before. Today it serves as a high end retail complex of shops, bars and restaurants and hence revamped as CHIJMES, a play on words using the original name of the convent CHIJ. Its beautiful Gothic chapel is often used as an entertainment venue for parties and weddings. CHIJMES won a Merit Award in the UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2002. While 160-year-old CHIJMES has not been a place of learning and sanctuary in years, this place still holds great value in the hearts of many convent girls and is an integral part of Singapore’s history.",

The hut contains an altar with eerie feminine items like nail polish, brushes and lipstick, offerings to the German girl represented by the doll encased in a box at the center of the altar. The shrine was made to store the remains of a German girl who lived and died before WWI. Her parents had owned a plantation on the island. Before the war broke out, the British came upon the island and rounded up the plantation owner and his family. The daughter, believed to be about 18 years old, escaped the British but not death as she fell off a cliff into a quarry. Her body was found the next day by the Boyanese who had worked for her father. Out of respect, they buried her. Years later, locals took her remains and her silver crucifix and stored it in an urn they placed in the shrine. Over time, the girl in the shrine somehow became a Taoist deity in the eyes of the people, stranger still since the girl had likely been Roman Catholic when she was alive. The shrine became known to gamblers all over the region, attracting those from the mainland and Malaysia who still make offerings of nail polish and dolls for blessings of luck and health from the German girl. In 1974, quarry company Aik Hwa gifted the shrine with a Jiangsu urn to store the girl’s remains, but tragically the urn was later stolen by vandals, along with the remains of the German girl and her silver crucifix. Although many know that her remains are likely no longer on the island, the German girl’s worshippers and devotees still believe that her soul and powers are still active on the island whose history she had become a part of.","Near Ketam Quarry on the West side of the island. Follow the Ketam bike trail and the signs will lead you to the shrine. It is no longer in a small yellow hut, but is now in a more permanent concrete building. You are required to remove your shoes before entering."
91,St. Joseph's Church,Singapore,The first Catholic church in Singapore is a Neo-Gothic colossus with a rich architectural history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-joseph-s-church,"Surrounded by crowded shopping centers and glassy corporate buildings is a small sanctuary of calm in the busy Central Business District of Singapore called St Joseph’s Church. Declared a national monument in 2005, this little white church accented with sky blue was the first Catholic Church in Singapore. Like many old churches, St Joseph’s is built in the shape of the Latin cross. Built to accommodate 1,500 worshippers, the architect of the church was D. McLeod Craik. The Neo-Gothic architectural style is evident in decorative architectural elements of the windows and roof. All over the church are marble statues and altars. There are also Portuguese azulejos (decorative tiles) on the walls of the church portraying the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima. The main altar for St Joseph and another dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes were crafted by the Milanese firm Fratelli Barttarelli. The altars of Our Lady of Fatima and St Anthony were crafted by the Italian firm Bertelli. The original statue of Fatima was donated by prominent Portuguese parishioner Dr Caetano Xavier Furtado whose descendants still attend the church. It was an exact replica of the pilgrim statue from Rome that visited Singapore in 1950 and made by Portuguese sculptor Avelino Moreira Vinhas. This statue was eventually replaced. Splashes of colour in the church come in the form of the handmade Italian stained glass windows depicting various saints, each costing $1200 and coming from the donations of various families and communities such as the community of Goa or the Shepherdson family. One particular window of Saint Catherine was donated by the architect of the building D. M. Craik in memory of his daughter Katherine who died at sea. Outside the church is the grotto dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima. Established in 1853, the church was named after St Joseph by its first priest Francisco da Silva Pinto e Maia who arrived 30 June 1825. The priest had previously been conducting mass at the Beach Road residence of his friend, Dr Jose d’Almeida from 1825 to1833 and a small chapel from 1833 to 1853. Using the land acquired from Samuel George Bonham, Assistant to the Resident of Singapore, Fr Maia had the church built. He named it after St Joseph because prior to his arrival in Singapore, he had been a professor at St Joseph’s Seminary in Macao prior to coming to Singapore and the land and houses bought in Singapore had been paid for with funds from China’s Portuguese Mission in China, whose procuration house was St Joseph’s College in Macau. However, Fr Maia fell ill and passed away in 1850, before the project was completed. His remains are placed beneath the main altar. His successor, Vincente de Santa Catarina took over and the church was blessed and opened in 1853. In 1906, the church was demolished and rebuilt. The current building was completed in 1912 by Swan & MacLaren with D. M. Craik. In 1981, the control of the church was passed from the Portuguese Mission to the ordinary jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Singapore, ceasing to be a parish church and becoming a church of devotion. Today, while the last Portuguese priest ended his term in 1999, the church still observes a number of Portuguese traditions. It still attracts Catholics from all around the island for its famed annual Good Friday procession. Yet the numbers of regular parishioners are dwindling as the old Catholic families move farther and farther away from the church which is situated in the Central Business District, leaving the church quieter and quieter as the years go by.",

93,Kampong Lorong Buangkok,Singapore,Singapore's last surviving traditional village is hidden among giant skyscrapers and modern infrastructure.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kampong-lorong-buangkok,"Singapore is the world’s most urban nation, with 100 percent of its population living in urban areas, according to UNESCO. But hidden beneath its towering skyscrapers and modern infrastructure is one low-lying hidden gem: the main island’s last surviving traditional village. Built in 1956 before Singapore’s economic boom, Kampong Lorong Buangkok’s 28 dwellings are home to families who live differently from nearly everyone else in the city-state. Located in Singapore’s northern suburbs, the kampong (village) contrasts sharply with the concrete high rises that house the majority of locals. The village, which is the size of two soccer fields, offers a window into what Singapore looked like before it became a global trade giant. Visit, and you’ll find colorful one-story houses, a canal, a small mosque, and winding dirt paths weaving through the town. The houses are made with zinc and wood roofs. Kampong Lorong Buangkok was settled by a mixture of Malaysians and Chinese. The residents enjoy a slower pace of life and strong sense of community. Although the village is somewhat isolated from urban Singapore, it still has electricity, running water, garbage collection, and a postal service. The village was established by Chinese medicine seller Sng Teow Koon as a plot of four to six homes. For rent, the residents pay upwards of $30 per month to his children. However, the land the village sits on is worth approximately $33 million, so some residents fear that the kampong may soon be paved over for a new development.","The village is accessible by buses 70 and 103, near the Church of St Vincent de Paul. Please be a conscientious visitor, as people still live here."
94,Bronze Bathers,Singapore,"The most playful of the life-sized statues that make up Singapore's ""People of the River.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bronze-bathers-singapore-quay,"Early life on the Singapore River was an innocent time, and while that time is now lost in the towering buildings and busy lifestyles of the modern-day city, the “People of the River” series of statues that line the water are a reminder of those carefree days. While there is a whole series of life-sized people doing everyday things, none evoke that feeling of uncomplicated living as the “Bronze Bathers.” The now bustling city was once a modest river settlement, and playing with Singapore’s open museum concept, local artists created the “People of the River” to create a window into the city’s history. Located in the Boat Quay, which back in the 1860s handled three-quarters of the shipping service, the bathers seem to elicit joy in all who see them. Five gleaming, life-sized chestnut-colored boys, naked as can be, are in different stages of leaping into the water. One throws his arms up as he falls through the air, another pushes his friend who is either to scared to jump or blocking the route. One boy sits on the ledge, contemplating his jump, and the fifth has just noticed the fun, and is climbing the fence to get in on the action. This piece, as well as the rest of the river people, can be found along the water of the Singapore River in the Boat Quay, positioned behind the Maybank Building and the Fullerton Hotel. A camera is suggested; it’s hard to resist silly or inappropriate photos when surrounded by nude life-sized statues.",Take the MRT to Raffles Place Station (EW14/NS26) and walk towards Fullerton Hotel and Maybank Building. The sculptures can be found behind these buildings along the Singapore River.
95,Merlion,Singapore,"This statue once earned the distinction as one of the ""Three Major Disappointments of the World.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/merlion,"The water-spewing Merlion is the official mascot of Singapore. However, along with the Little Mermaid of Copenhagen and the Manneken Pis statue of Brussels, it’s also known as one of the “Three Major Disappointments of the World.” The massive statue earned this moniker following its installment in 1972. Not long after, the statue’s pumping system jammed and stopped spouting water for nearly three decades. The front view of the fountain was also obscured from tourists by a bridge. The pump was fixed in 2002 and a new pedestrian bridge was later constructed for observation. Since these additions, the statue’s popularity has gradually returned. Despite its symbolic status, the Merlion is not based on local mythology. It was designed in 1964 by Alec Fraser-Brunner, a member of the Souvenir Committee and curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium. The symbol was originally the logo for the tourism board. It represents the island city-state of Singapore, inspired by the country’s history and name, which means “lion city.” In 2009, the Merlion was struck by lightning, but no one was hurt and the statue was restored in a month. Today, the structure has spawned numerous imitations across Asia. Although its water pump still jams from time to time, visitors won’t be disappointed by this magnificent structure.",
96,Japanese Cemetery Park,Singapore,"From prostitutes to soldiers to business men, the dead in this graveyard are a microcosm of Singapore's history with Japan.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/japanese-cemetery-park,"Untouched and enclosed, the Japanese Cemetery Park lies quietly in the residential area of Chuan Hoe Avenue. It receives little publicity in order to avoid angering the older generations of Singaporeans who survived the atrocities committed by the Japanese during World War II. Owned by the Japanese Association, it is the only cemetery that has never been in danger of demolition, exhumation or desecration by the Singapore government. Established in 1891, merchants, prostitutes and soldiers alike are buried in this park. The seven-acre piece of land on which it sits was formerly a rubber plantation owned by three brothel owners. The request of building a Japanese cemetery was approved by the British colonial government on 26 June 1891, and its management was handed to the Japanese-run Mutual Self-Help Society. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the majority of the Japanese population in Singapore was prostitutes, or karayuki-san, from the rural prefectures of Japan, hence half the graves in the cemetery are of Japanese prostitutes who died in Singapore or on the way back to Japan. Post-WWI, more Japanese merchants and businessmen started trade with Singapore. The more elaborate gravestones belong to them. Some notable Japanese people who were buried or memorialised there include Ueyama Kantaro, son of the inventor of the mosquito coil, and Futabatei Shimei, pioneer of realism in Japanese literature. During the Japanese Occupation in WWII, the Japanese took control of the cemetery. Military casualties were buried in the cemetery. After the Japanese surrender in 1946, the soldiers who committed suicide or were executed for war crimes were cremated there. When the British returned to govern Singapore, all Japanese were deported and none were allowed to return until the 1951 peace treaty. In 1952, the Japanese Consul-General to Singapore Ken Ninomiya requested a search for the remains of their war dead. As the remains were all buried together, identification was not possible. The Japanese government decided to fund the restoration of the cemetery instead. The cemetery features a stone garden and a prayer temple. There are also gravestones and memorials made by the prisoners of war for deceased generals and soldiers. Another highlight of the cemetery is the memorial stone of Terengganu-born Tani Yutaka, otherwise known as Harimau or the Tiger of Malaya. He was a secret agent for the Japanese military and has been depicted in Japanese novels and films. Since 1969, the cemetery has been owned by the Japanese Association. While the last burial in the Japanese Cemetery Park took place in 1973, but the park still has a caretaker by the name of Lim Geok Qi who took on the job after his father. Qi lives with his family on the cemetery land, maintaining the graves and serving as a guide for visitors looking into the rich and complicated history of Japan-Singapore relations.","Take buses 43, 70, 70M or 116 from Serangoon MRT Station and alight at Blk 133 (B63201).

Built in 1921, Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, or Bright Hill Temple, is a Buddhist temple complex founded by Venerable Zhuan Dao. Originally, the complex housed only two shrine halls. But after Venerable Hong Choon took over as abbot in 1947, the monastery expanded rapidly. Today, it sits on more than 800,000 square feet of land, roughly the size of 14 football fields. The complex also has many amenities, such as multiple prayer halls, bell and drum towers, a crematorium, and two columbaria. In 2006, the Buddhist College of Singapore opened on the compound, offering bachelor’s and master’s programs in Buddhism to English and Mandarin speakers. Between the Dharma Hall and the Pagoda of 10,000 Buddhas, visitors will find an enormous statue of the bodhisattva Guan Yin. One of Asia’s largest indoor Buddha statues—made from bronze, measuring 45 feet in height, and weighing many tons—sits in the nearby Hall of No Form. The grounds are large, with gardens and a Dragon Pond that are decorated during celebrations. You can also find a Bodhi tree next to the Hall of Amrita Precepts, the same species of tree under which Shakyamuni Buddha achieved enlightenment. Though it is often bursting with people during Buddhist celebrations such as Vesak Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival. Laypeople regularly visit the monastery to seek refuge from the large crowds and hectic pace of Singapore. On Sundays, and on the 1st, 15th, and 27th days of the lunar month, free vegetarian food is served in the dining hall.","Parking is limited, so public transit is recommended during holidays and events.

Its name derives from its striking resemblance to Guilin in China. Little Guilin was once a quarry, supplying much of Singapore’s granite needs until it was abandoned in the 1980s. Rainwater collected in the depression over time, turning the quarry into a lake. In 1984, the Housing and Development Board developed Little Guilin into a park, which it still is today. Little Guilin is known to urban explorers and those living around the region, but it’s relatively unknown to most other Singaporeans.","Little Guilin is easily accessible by public transportation and is within walking distance from Bukit Gombak MRT Station (NS3).

Land where chewing gum is illegal and the only landfill is a tourist attraction. If you thought they’d have an unusual animal or two, you’d be correct. But rather than tuck them away in some difficult to reach forest or underwater cavern, Singapore displays its fantastic fauna right out in the open. One of the most intriguing? Quantula striata, the blinking snail. While Singapore isn’t the only place this terrestrial mollusk struts its stuff, it’s the perfect place to find one. This unassuming snail has a bland spiral shell, which in the daytime might not even catch your eye. But at night the snails blink, and the faster they move the faster they flicker on and off. They slow the blink a bit while eating, and when they’re asleep, it’s lights out. The flashes, which aren’t quite as bright as those of a firefly, are produced by the exotic-sounding “organ of Haneda” which is found in the “head” of the critter. Even its eggs glow. The snails are common after it rains, and prefer to hang out near human activity, especially lawns, fresh excavations, and garbage dumps. They’ll enjoy your garden if you give them the chance to dine on your lettuce and carrots. They also have a taste for rat food, should you wish to keep one as a pet.",The snails prefer disturbed areas and lawns.

Founded around 1827 by Naraina Pillai and constructed in Dravidian style (a distinctive architecture used in South India by Tamils), the temple is now designated as a National Monument. It’s also dedicated to Sri Mariamman, a folk goddess. The most outstanding feature of the Sri Mariamman Temple is the towering five-floored gopuram handing above the main entrance. Each floor is slightly smaller than the one below it, making the structure look higher than it actually appears. The gopuram is decorated with sculptures of Hindu mythology, including various deities, exotic beasts, and cultural figures. It’s believed that all of them were crafted by skilled artisans that were brought in from the Nagapattinam and Cuddalore districts in southern India. Another distinctive feature of the temple is the statue of Aravan, a deity that is always worshipped in the form of his severed head.

105,Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng,Singapore,"The confluence of modernist and traditional architecture in this religious complex reflects the history of both the living and the dead being uprooted, displaced, and rehoused.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kwong-wai-siew-peck-san-theng,"The modern Peck San Theng (known in Mandarin as Bishan Ting, or “Pavilions on the Jade Hill”) was constructed in the 1980s. It was built on the former grounds of a Chinese cemetery of the same name, which was established around 1870 and existed until 1979. The original Peck San Theng was one of the largest cemeteries in Singapore, covering 324 acres of land with an attached village, Kampong San Theng, home to some 2,000 residents. Life at the cemetery was colorful, dense with the pageantry of Cantonese death rituals. The pavilions alluded to in its name refer to the 12 pavilions erected to provide shelter for visitors. However, Peck San Theng also gained a reputation for lawlessness and gang activities. During the Japanese Occupation, the village functioned as a state within a state, largely left alone by the Japanese soldiers who were reportedly wary of the cemetery’s ghostly occurrences. The cemetery could not, however, escape the inevitability of Singapore’s urban redevelopment schemes. Land-scarce Singapore needed the sprawling acreage of Peck San Theng, and in 1978 the Housing Development Board reclaimed the land, exhuming 100,000 graves in four years to construct the modern estate of Bishan. The Cantonese and Hakka clan associations retained just eight of its original 324 hectares on which they rebuilt two temples and a community hall, essential components of life in Kampong San Theng. A museum was opened on the grounds in 2016 to tell the story of Peck San Theng. The most significant building in the modern Peck San Theng has to be the columbarium. It was designed by the renowned architect Tay Kheng Soon, who had recently designed the iconic modernist living space the Golden Mile Complex. Just as the living were rehoused from villages to high-rise public housing, the dead were exhumed, cremated, and interred in columbariums. Peck San Theng was one of the first. A starkly modernist columbarium was envisioned to reflect the novelty of this cremation to Chinese death rituals. Tay conceived of the columbarium as a hemi-hexagonal structure that resembled a traditional Chinese tomb. A series of cascading levels evoked the hills that gave the place its name. The Peck San Theng columbarium not only reflects the Chinese folk belief in continuity between one’s life and afterlife, but also codes in its design the cultural shifts in living practices that an entire population, including the dead, had undergone.","The columbarium is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and until 4 p.m. on weekends and public holidays. The heritage gallery is open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m, daily, and until 1 p.m. on public holidays."

With five permanent exhibits and a variety of traveling and themed temporary galleries, the Museum boasts files of every Republic of Singapore stamp issued, all available for the perusal of visitors. Their mission is to help promote the use of philately (the collection and study of stamps) for educational purposes, as stamp design is often a great historical indicator of how the public, government, and culture as a whole related to internal and external events of the given time period. The Museum was opened on August 19, 1995, housed in a building that was once part of the Anglo Chinese school dating back to 1906. Designed by Tomlinson and Lermit Architects, the building was commissioned by the Trustees of the Anglo Chinese School as an addition to the 1897 Oldam Hall. It was then used as a Methodist Book Room from 1970 until its restoration as the Singapore Philatelic Museum in 1995. The Museum is currently a fully owned subsidiary of the National Heritage Board. Not just for stamp buffs, the Museum offers a view into the traditions and cultures of a multi-ethnic Singapore as captured on stamps throughout the decades, as well as demonstrates the process of stamp production through guest-interactive activities and exhibits. The main collection is the Straits Settlements Collection, displaying stamps and other postal archival material as early as 1854.

The sculpture makes use of the mother and child motif, common in Singaporean art and is associated with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA). The sculpture explores humanistic themes of emotional attraction and kinship. In particular, Ng emphasized his view that maternal care and nurturing were essential to the growth of individuals and society, symbolized by the safely cradled child. Ng’s artistic abilities were spotted by pioneering art educator Georgette Chen at NAFA, who thought that Ng’s affinity for creating sculptures was a talent Singapore was desperately missing. In 1962, Chen directed Ng to study in The Potteries in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Ng continued to study and work in the British Isles until 1966. Steeped in the concepts of the British Arts and Crafts movement, Ng’s idiosyncratic, biomorphic sculptures began to sprout across the newly-independent Singapore. The other “Mother and Child” sculpture, cast in 1996, now stands in front of the National Gallery of Singapore. The older sculpture has stood on the same site since its casting and has come to define the older stretch of Orchard Road.","The sculpture is situated outside Orchard Parade Hotel, near the intersection of Tanglin Road, Orchard Road, and Orange Grove Road."

109,‘From Chettiars to Financiers’,Singapore,"A unique, time-transcending work of art depicting the progress of trade in Singapore.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/from-chettiars-to-financiers,"The embankments of the Singapore River are known for their numerous monuments and public sculptures, most notably that of the boys leaping into the water. However, the piece titled “From Chettiars to Financiers” is largely overlooked, but provides a unique insight into Singapore’s progress in commerce. Created by Taiwanese artist Chern Lian Shan in 2002, the sculpture represents the financial institutions in the area. While the chettiar—a moneylending merchant from South India—attends to his business at a low desk placed on a woven mat, the pigtailed Chinese clerk is doing math using a suanpan abacus. Intriguingly, beside them stands a businesswoman in a distinctly modern suit. The sculpture, transcending time, tells the story of how trade in Singapore has changed over the years.",
110,Umbrella Trees,Singapore,Colorful umbrella-covered trees in Singapore's Little India look straight out of Dr. Seuss.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/umbrella-trees-of-little-india,"The city-state of Singapore is located in a tropical rainforest climate, getting 92 inches of rain every year. But in Singapore’s Little India, on the aptly named Hindoo Road, locals and tourists alike can get protection from the frequent downpours by sitting beneath one of the neighborhood’s unique Umbrella Trees. Little India’s forest of Umbrella Trees—where the trees’ leaves are replaced by vibrant umbrellas—appears to have sprung straight out of the mind of Dr. Seuss. Part of an art installation created by local artist Marthalia Budiman, the Umbrella Trees have transformed a small public park space into an oasis of color, beauty, and protection from the elements. There are five Umbrella Trees in the grassy space, colored with a palette of red, orange, yellow, blue, and purple umbrellas. Each tree rises up from a large green cushion that visitors can sit on to escape the rain and beating sun in comfort. Update February 2018: This installation has been removed. There are now a dozen or so colorfully painted elephants, rather than umbrella trees.",
111,The Clinic,Singapore,"""Would you like your sangria in an IV bag, or straight-up?""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-clinic-singapore,"Medical themed bar and eatery in the heart of Singapore’s Clarke Quay district takes pharmacopoeia to new levels, all in “tribute” to contemporary artist Damien Hirst. With wheelchairs as the standard seating, hospital beds for a more reclined dining experience, drinks served in test tubes, all the patrons lit in a bright glow shining from a operating lights, and the servers in medical whites, the restaurant stays true to its Hospital theme. Designed by the Dutch firm “Concrete Architects,” while at times the restaurant feels like an exciting and interesting idea, for the most part the IV cocktail drips, pill shaped food and the Damien Hirst art hanging everywhere feels a bit more like a theme party, than high dining.",
112,Changi Junk Store,Singapore,A so-called Singapore junk store that is closer to a historical restoration center.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/changi-junk-store,"Contrary to what its name suggests, very little in the Changi Junk Store could be considered junk. The unassuming little store on Joo Chiat Road is piled high with antiques salvaged from everywhere, stuffed so full that patrons have to enter in single file and exit the same way. However, with antiques ranging from Victorian-era four-poster beds to dolls made of Ming dynasty coins, the asthma inducing narrow trail through the shop is definitely worth it. Run by collector and dealer Pak Haji Basman, this decades-old shop contains high-value antiques of different styles, time periods, and cultures including local antiques like coins from the colonial times and Peranakan rice baskets. There are also relics of the region like the kris (knives) of Indonesian princes and Qing dynasty porcelain, as well as curiosities from distant lands like European typewriters and WWI bayonets. A former boxer, Mr Basman also provides restoration services for furniture, which he often does singlehandedly, with a specialty in Asian, Peranakan, and blackwood pieces. He has been collecting antiques for the past 40 years and most of the shop’s inventory is stored in a warehouse in Kallang. Sadly the warehouse is rarely opened to the public.

114,Sungei Road Thieves Market,Singapore,"A licentious look into Singapore's past, full of disorderly bric-a-brac and disreputable characters.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sungei-road-thieves-market,"Nestled in between construction sites, half-built apartment buildings, and high rises are two tiny streets and one fenced in, decrepit, abandoned lot. This is what remains of the Sungei Road Thieves Market, a patchwork of a flea market with vibrant characters and a colourful history. If you find yourself in Little India or in Kampong Glam, a stop by the Thieves Market is obligatory, especially if you want to see the remnants of a past that has been obscured by skyscrapers, Louis Vuitton, and Mercedes Benz. The tiny intersecting streets are lined with “vendors,” their mats spread on the ground, shaded by tattered umbrellas and tarps. Their wares; indefinable. You’ll find everything from thirty year old unopened bottles of coke, to bundles of wires, broken electronics, ten year old cell phones, CD’s, a plethora of watches, rusty nails, fake coins, and, if you’re in the market, a collection of lonely, solitary shoes. Since the 1930s, Sungei Road gained its notoriety as an unregulated market for fenced goods and disreputable characters. A history of opium dens, poverty, and sales of stolen, smuggled and illegal goods have not garnered much favour from the Singaporean government. As such, the state has slowly been hemming it in, with property sales and gentrification of the area pushing the market into two small streets. On 10 July 2017, the market saw its final day, being closed for good to make room for redevelopment.",
115,Keramat Kusu,Singapore,Three Malay graves are at the center of an annual pilgrimage that reflects syncretic practices.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kusu-keramat,"Located on Kusu (Turtle) Island, not far from mainland Singapore, the keramats (venerated shrines) of Syed Abdul Rahman, Nenek Ghalib, and Puteri Fatimah stand as an emblem of syncretic cultural and religious practices in the region. Together with the broadly Taoist Tua Pek Kong temple, the keramats are the focus of the annual pilgrimage season, held on the 9th lunar month of the Chinese calendar. The keramats are also referred to as Datuk Kong, a portmanteau Sino-Malay honorific for a respected person. A set of myths provide some clues as to the origins of this pilgrimage practice. Though they vary, a common theme of the myths is a co-operative bond formed between Chinese and Malay communities. The most well-known myth involves a Chinese and Malay fisherman establishing a place of worship after being saved from drowning by a turtle. There is evidence that pilgrimages to the island began before the founding of the British colony of Singapore in 1819. First used by the British to bury those who died in quarantine on nearby St. John’s Island, joint Sino-Malay indignation pushed the colonial administration to respect the religious significance of the island. The precise identity of Syed Abdul Rahman is unclear, though tradition states that he was a holy man who made his way to the island with his mother and sister, whose graves were collectively venerated after their deaths. Some accounts ascribed the identity of the shipwrecked Malay man to Rahman. The present structure was constructed in 1921 by the Peranakan Chinese Hoe Beng Whatt, after Ghalib reportedly visited him in his dreams. Chinese patronage shaped the nature of the veneration of the keramats. A Chinese joss paper burner, an altar to the God of Fortune, Chinese temple embroidery, and a wish-making tree associated with childbearing reflects broader diasporic Chinese religious practices that were added to the site. During the pilgrimage season, the Keramat is manned by a small team of Malay caretakers. After donating a small amount, the caretakers would recite a short text in a mixture of Malay and Hokkien, calling upon the enshrined to grant the devotee wealth, good fortune, and fertility. The Kusu pilgrimage continues to attract many worshippers, some from as far as Vietnam and Thailand. Worship at the keramat transcends religious boundaries. It remains a living heritage site that resists monolithic categories of religion, culture, and identity.",Ferries to Kusu Island are available from Marina South Pier.
116,Yongma Land Abandoned Theme Park,"Seoul, South Korea",Plenty of old carney magic still haunts this photogenic amusement park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yongma-land-abandoned-themepark,"There is a small abandoned theme park in Seoul, South Korea, with a quieted carousel, bleached-out images of ’80s pop icons, and “dodgem” cars that have long-since quit dodging. But unlike most amusement parks that have gone idle, this one invites the public to share in its slow crumble. Yongma Land was built in 1980, and had a fairly solid run as a small family-oriented amusement park. By 2011 tastes had moved on, and with attendance dwindling it closed down. Despite stories of a haunting or two, the root of its demise was likely just a matter of profit, when the construction of several, much larger and better located, theme parks lured the thrill-seekers away. Now in the hands of an enterprising local businessman, the old Yongma Land is open again, but this time to revel in the poignant charm of its decay. For a small charge of 10,000 won per adult (about $9, a bit more for professionals) and 5,000 won per child, visitors are free to roam the old rides, no fence-jumping needed. And for 30,000 won, the owner will turn on the lights of the ghostly merry-go-round for you after 8:00 pm. The fading colors and jumbled figures have proven attractive for musicians and other artists too, inspiring several K-pop videos (most notably Crayon Pop’s “Bar Bar Bar” video) and other photo shoots. With piles of dodgem (or bumper) cars, a rusting octopus ride, a Viking ship, and a displaced clown-motif roller coaster, there is still plenty of carney magic to inspire even amateur photographers.","Mangu Station is the closest train station to Yongma Land. From there, you can take a bus most of the way or walk. Head for the gate and pass through the first one to a second gate, where there is a ticket booth. If the owner is in the office he’ll take your entry fee. And if not, there is a phone number you can call. Just mention 'Yongma Land'. Although none of the rides work anymore, the owner does keep the toilet facilities maintained, and you can purchase some vending machine items (and balloons for photos) on-site. But be careful—the site is run down and things are rickety. And if the weather is a bit drizzly, chances are you might have the place all to yourself."
117,Trick Eye Museum,"Seoul, South Korea",South Korea's love of the silly photograph is on full display at this goofy collection of trompe l'oeil paintings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trick-eye-museum,"Trompe l’oeil is a classical artistic technique wherein the artist attempts to create a two-dimensional image that appears to exist in three-dimensions. The Trick Eye Museum in Seoul celebrates this art form with a collection of interactive optical illusions ranging from the unbearably silly to the classically whimsical. While the high-minded tradition of trompe l’oeil is certainly on display in the museum it is all in service to providing opportunities for goofy photo opportunities. Containing hundreds of oversized paintings for visitors to jump into, the museum allows guests to orient themselves in perspective with the images so that it can seem as though they are being crushed by a hydra, hanging off of a cliff, or taking part in Botticelli’s Birth of Venus. Some of the images are whole rooms that seem to have been turned on their head or their side allowing the subject to look like they are climbing the walls or standing on the ceiling. The giant paintings of sushi pieces reaching out from the frame and images of angel wings just waiting to be stepped into might come off as garish if they weren’t mixed together with works that ape a classical renaissance style, some replica of actual artworks that guests can make themselves a part of. The Trick Eye Museum continues to add optical illusions to its collection which now covers almost every wall in the space. In addition, the museum has also opened an “Ice Museum” next door that while retaining the Trick Eye name has nothing to do with tromp l’oeil images and is solely focused on ice sculptures and plastic displays of frozen water. The connection seems a bit strained, but both sites provide ample photo opportunities.",

That’s not because it’s located on a cliff. Instead, Seoul’s Cafe Yeonnam-Dong 223-14, named after its street number and affectionately known as the “Drawing Cafe,” may dizzy you with the uncanny feeling that you just entered a cartoon. Done up in white, with pencil-like black pigment outlining everything from the chairs and tables to the flattened “shirts” on the laundry line outside, the small cafe gives visitors the distinct impression of being pressed into a comic strip. The pastel pastries and frothed milk topping the “flat” cups add a pop of color to this stark, pencil-and-paper landscape. The cafe’s owner and sole proprietor, J.S. Lee, was inspired by pop culture—specifically, a Korean cartoon and Instagram. The show in question is W, a web cartoon fantasy about a man caught between real life and, you guessed it, a web cartoon. While that show lasted only 16 episodes, Lee’s cafe, though still young, seems to have staying power. That’s partly due to his other online muse: The cafe was designed to be as Instagrammable as possible. Locals and travelers alike line up to visit the small space, located in Seoul’s Yeonnam-dong neighborhood, to snap a pic or 10 and to dine on deceptively 2-D coffees, pastries, and rich smoothies adorned in chocolate coins. Visitors are warned to take care, however, lest they walk through the cartoon door and find themselves stuck starring in their own multidimensional web series.","The cafe is open daily from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., though visitors should be warned: The line to enter is often quite lengthy with crowds clamoring for their photo op."
119,Imsil Cheese Theme Park,"Imsil-gun, South Korea",A 32-acre fun park dedicated to all things cheese.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/imsil-cheese-theme-park,"Up until a few decades ago, many people in Korea had never heard of cheese, let alone tasted it or made it. Now a 32-acre cheese-themed fun park in the small county of Imsil is an expression of the country’s love affair with the food. The introduction of cheese to the Korean diet is traced back to 1958, when a Belgian priest came to Imsil in the Jeollabuk-do region as a missionary, where he raised goats and started to make his own cheese. The governor of Imsil asked him to teach the skill to the whole community. And so Imsil became the mecca of cheese in Korea. The Imsil Cheese Theme Park, opened in 2004, is a cheese heaven where you can learn about, make, and eat the delightful dairy, ride down the slide past the goats to the Cheese Playland, and stroll the walkways checking out the cheese-wheel buildings and various cartoon statues that dot the park. The park has a few “cheese experience” centers where you can make cheese, a milk processing factory, a local specialty shop, two restaurants, and a science lab that researches different methods for making the best cheese.","The Cheese Theme Park is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., closed on major holidays."

The delicate collection is divided into indoor and outdoor sections, each with their own variety of delicate glasswork. The exterior garden features such amazingly naturalistic installations as a glass waterfall, glass flowerbeds, and lake made of mirrors with fish constructed out of used soju (a popular Korean alcohol) bottles. The indoor sights include a towering green glass beanstalk in the center of the exhibition hall, a room full of mirrors where visitors can get lost in their infinite reflections, and even a glass bookshelf with glass books. The bright crystalline colors of the over 200 pieces at the castle are mainly not to be touched lest the entire site comes crashing down from an errant poke, but there are a number interactive bits such as the glass drums which attendees can bang on if they dare. For an extra fee, visitors can even experience making their own glass creations. The Jeju Glass Castle Theme Park bills itself as an attraction for the whole family. Just make sure nobody trips.",

The media likes to repeat legends of mysterious deaths, mad doctors that were as crazy as the patients in the asylum, and other “fakelore” to hype the creepy factor of the place, but the hospital was closed in the 1990s and abandoned for more mundane reasons than their tall tales would have you believe. Gonjiam was forced to close mainly due to economic downturns, unsanitary conditions, and problems with the sewage disposal system, not due to insane doctors or murderous patients. As the sewage problem grew, the owner left the country and did not leave documentation behind about the land or the buildings on it. Eventually, the hospital just closed its doors and it has been abandoned ever since, unless you count the numerous tourists, camera crews, and ghost hunters who come to stroll through the area, looking for evidence of paranormal activity or the proverbial skeletons in the closets of the asylum. The hospital is technically closed to the public and locals do not encourage tourists or give directions to the asylum willingly but roughly a thousand people break in and roam the grounds of Gonjiam Psychiatric hospital every year. The buildings stand complete with rusted out machines, hospital remnants, trash, and filthy mattresses, adding to its creepy and haunted reputation. In 2018, they released a horror film called “Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum” about the Gonjiam Psychiatric Hospital. Update: This was demolished in May 2018.",
122,Third Tunnel of Aggression,"Paju, South Korea",Secret North Korean passage discovered below the world's most dangerous border.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/third-tunnel-of-aggression,"For the most part, every inch of the world can be explored. If you can fly, drive or walk to it, it’s fair game. The Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea represents one of the few stretches of land that is off limits, or at least the surface of it is. There are tunnels, it turns out, underground that can be visited. Called the Third Tunnel of Aggression, it was built by North Korea in the 1970s and discovered in 1978 by South Korea. It was the third tunnel found by the South—a total of four have been discovered—and it is rumored there may be more than a dozen more undiscovered North Korean passages. At the time of its discovery, the United Nations estimated the North could move 30,000 men per hour through the tunnel to the Southern side. After initially denying its existence, the North claimed that the Third Tunnel was a coal mine, going as far as to rub black coal dust on the walls. That tactic obviously failed and the South took control of the tunnel, blocking off the actual demarcation line with concrete barriers. Nowadays, the passage snakes beneath the divided nations for over a mile and, at its outset, looks like a space-age tunnel from a science fiction movie. Although the tunnel is available for visitors on tours and even begins with a gift shop, deeper down the two-by-two-meter tunnel are stark reminders of the danger the tunnel represents. As you walk along the path, the light dims and visitors are left only with moist, craggy walls and the faint flickering lights installed along the way. You can walk a full 265 meters until hitting the divider installed to protect the South from attacks by the North.","Pictures are not allowed inside of the tunnel, making a journey down the burrow a haunting and visceral experience. Pre-approved tours can be arranged online, and most tours of the DMZ from Panmunjom include the Third Tunnel of Aggression. You'll be shown a South Korean-produced video detailing that nation's version of events surrounding the tunnel's discovery before you'll be allowed to enter the tunnel."

But you’d be well advised to trek down to Coffee Hanyakbang in the Euljiro area of Seoul. Never mind that it’s not visible from the street. The cafe’s interior sports a blend of Chinese and Korean designs, and a variety of Chinese antiques imported by the owners are on display. But the overall feeling inside is rustic, with a menu made from an old plank of wood and a gaping hole in the concrete ceiling revealing the pipes above the establishment. Hanyakbang has become well-known among coffee connoisseurs, serving delicious single-origin, hand-drip coffee at decent prices. The beans are roasted by hand in the back corner of the café and are ground on site, producing a fresh aroma that washes over you like a wave as you enter. The baristas, all dressed neatly in white, treat their work like a science, homing in on every pour to bring you the optimal cup. It’s the definition of a hidden gem in a city full of them, a quiet delight just far enough away from the hustle and bustle.","Take the subway to Euljiro 3-ga Station, and leave through Exit 1.

The exhibition halls that house the gift shop and gallery of the park are modeled after traditional Korean architecture, but very little else is of a “traditional” nature in this park. Bulkkeuni (a phallus wearing yellow mittens) and Saekkeuni (a vagina modeling a floppy hat and bow), the park’s mascots, welcome visitors through the front gates. The restrooms adhere to the sexual theme as well: two breasts for handles on the men’s door, and an erect penis as a doorknob for the women’s door. The outdoor theme park features 140 sculptures representing humans in various sexual positions. After the Korean War, the island became a popular honeymoon destination for Korean couples, due to the island’s warm climate. Many of the couples had wed because of arranged marriages, and the island also became known for being a center of sex education. Visitors are required to be at least 18 years old, and a separate play area is available for minors while adults visit.

To enter its lower hall, you must first step through the mouth of a dragon. The dragon’s body twists roughly 330 feet through trees and bushes. Why a giant dragon? The reptilian beasts represent good fortune, spiritual clarity, and in Buddhism, they are the protectors of the Buddha and the temples. This temple—aptly nicknamed the “Dragon Temple”—built a giant dragon to ensure ultimate fortune, clarity, and protection. In addition to offering protection, the coiled monster acts like a long, winding hallway. It’s filled with religious statues and artwork that tell the story of the Buddha, so your journey through the bowels of the beast is actually an educational experience. While making your way through the dragon’s body, you’ll pass a meditation area, Buddhist artwork, and dozens of little golden Buddha statues. A door within the dragon leads to the lower level of the temple. Apart from the colorful dragon, the main temple is stunning: the backdrop of the mountains, the peaceful quiet, and the two dragon heads that guard the temple make it a beautiful, unique temple experience. Surprisingly, this temple isn’t very popular with tourists, so it’s a great place to peacefully explore.","From Pohang Bus Terminal, take bus #510 for 34 stops, about 50 minutes, and get off at the Chilpo 1-ri stop.

In 1969, a man named Lee Chang-ho took shelter from a squall in the lee of Oedo, a tiny heap of rocks sticking out of the green waters of Hallyeohaesang National Park off the southeast coast of South Korea. Lee saw potential in the rocky little spot, and in that same year, moved he and his wife, Choi Ho Suk, to the island. At first they tried to harvest tangerines and raise pigs, but neither crop took to the land, so they began thinking about simply transforming the whole island into a botanical garden. After getting approval in 1976, Lee and his wife started growing what would eventually become a stunning botanical garden coating the entire surface of the island. After almost 30 years of growth and development, the little island now sports, trees, flowers, shrubs, and even cactus, and rare species of agave cascading down the island’s gentle slopes. The carefully manicured paths and precisely sculpted topiaries add a fantasy element to the setting, making it all seem a bit unreal. All of this, grown under the couples’ loving care. The island has been completely transformed into a little slice of paradise, its flower-covered hillsides and perfumed air are popular with Korean vacationers and tourists from around the world—those fortunate enough to learn about the island from locals at least. The Oedo Botanica is accessible by ferry from the nearby port of Gujora, and continues to be hailed for its picturesque statuary, hiking paths, scenic vistas of nearby Geoje Island, and thousands upon thousands of species of lush plant varieties. Not a bad place to take port in a storm.","Oedo lies adjacent to the larger and much more populous island of Geoje, and is only accessible by ferry. From Geoje's main cities of Okpo or Gohyeon, take a bus bound for the smaller town of Jangseungpo on Geoje's east coast. From there it's an easy walk to the Oedo ferry terminal at the port of Gujora, and a 20-minute voyage to Oedo's dock."

It was the first time kimchi, a spicy fermented cabbage dish, was experienced by such a wide variety of people. This marked the start of kimchi’s global journey. Now the dish, which is a traditional staple of both North and South Korea, can be seen on menus around the world. During the 1988 Olympics, visitors who tasted the dish and wanted to know more visited the Kimchi Museum, which opened in 1986 and had been moved to the Korea World Trade Center Complex for the event. This institution was later revamped and opened its doors as the Museum Kimchikan in 2015. Now, the museum showcases the 1,500-year-history of kimchi, the production of which is traditionally a community affair. Every fall, families gather to blend the chopped vegetables with spices and stock up for the winter ahead. The process is known as kimjang and this collaborative tradition was recognized in 2013 by UNESCO as a piece of intangible cultural heritage. The most well-known version consists of Napa cabbage, scallions, and chili and garlic powders. A wide variety of vegetables and seafood is used in the nearly 180 regional forms of the dish. At the Museum Kimchikan, visitors can view the production technique, which uses lactobacillus bacteria, under a microscope. They can also watch documentaries about the history of kimjang, and how the country’s most prominent families made kimchi. Most importantly, visitors are invited to sample the different varieties.","To participate in demonstrations and cooking classes, you must make a reservation at least four days prior.

The collection ranges from hanging arrangements to three-meter-tall trunks of wood, sculpted by Korean artists to showcase anything from joy, spirituality, to sexuality. The small Folk Museum attached showcases phallic-related art throughout the ages, as well as the history of the small fishing community. Haeshindang Park is tragic in origin. A young couple, madly in love and soon to be wed, was split by tragedy when the high tide overtook the woman in view of her fiancé on the shore. The next day, the number of fish caught dwindled. The following day, they dried up. The townspeople were said to be cursed and wondered what to do, that is, until a local fisherman relieved himself in the sea. The fish returned and men of the town took note. Thus, statues were constructed and placed in view of the shore.","From Samcheok: Take bus 24 to Sinnam (pronounced :Shinnom ).

130,Seodaemun Prison,"Seoul, South Korea",A chilling monument to Korean patriots who resisted the Japanese occupation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seodaemun-prison,"An anachronistic brick wall stands out amongst a rare park in one of Seoul’s quieter neighborhoods. Behind the nondescript wall, a guard tower looms, and below it, a grim gate. This gate marks the entrance to Seodaemun Prison, a relic from a forgotten era in Korea’s past steeped in subjugation and humiliation. Seodaemun Prison was opened in 1908 by occupying Japanese forces in an attempt to impose order on the newly acquired territory. Prior, the country had a virtually non-existent penal system, and the introduction of Seodaemun Prison was a precursor to full out occupation. Seodaemun became a bastion for the Korean independence movement from its opening in 1908 until the liberation of the country in 1945. As the Japanese arrested more patriots, the prison’s notoriety increased and it eventually became a symbol of perseverance. Many patriots died in custody, were tortured to death, or were executed within the prison’s walls. The macabre execution hall still stands, housing the prison’s gallows (with a tunnel nearby to dispose of corpses). Throughout the preserved prison-turned-museum, you can see chillingly recreated torture chambers, jail cells, isolation cells, and more. The women’s section has been preserved, basement cells in which no privacy was afforded. Some of the torture chambers have frighteningly realistic mannequins and effigies to famous Korean patriots who died within the prison. Designated as a historic site in 1988 and renovated in 1995, Seodaemun is an interesting place to visit for those who want a tactile experience of the Japanese occupation and the horrors entailed. It stands out amongst Seoul’s other historic sites as a monument to those who helped shape the modern Korean nation.",
131,Japanese Ruins of Busan,"Busan, South Korea",The 400-year-old remains of the samurai invasion of Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/japanese-castle-ruins-of-busan,"In the late 16th century, Japanese Samurai lords, daimyos, built several castle-like fortresses in Busan during an ambitious plan to conquer Joseon Korea and Ming China. The Koreans, with the later help of the Ming emperor, used guerrilla tactics and flame-throwing armored turtle ships to expel the Japanese from the peninsula. The fortresses, however, remained. Several of the 400-year-old castle ruins can be still be seen around the southeast of Korea. They are mostly ivy and root-tangled walls and grassy baileys, situated in peaceful green parks. These ruins were once the site of some of bloody battles between the Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese forces. The Japanese invasion of Korea, or Imjin War, began in the spring of 1592 when samurai warriors and several thousand soldiers landed on Korean shores and laid siege to the city of Busan. Samurai scaled the walls of the Busanjin garrison under the cover of arquebus fire and overran the Korean defenses. After the Korean defeat, the Japanese, led by daimyo Toyotomi Hideyoshi, erected a network of Japanese-style fortresses in Korea to prepare for an assault on China. But Japan would not make it all the way to Beijing. Korean national hero admiral Yi Sun Sin harassed and weakened the Japanese resupply line with turtle ships, armored battleships with dragon-head bows that could shoot fire and cannon balls. On land, the Korean righteous army fought guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. The Ming emperor Wanli sent an army to stop the invaders as they reached and conquered Pyongyang, the modern-day capital of North Korea. The Japanese finally retreated back to Japan in 1598. History would repeat itself in 1910 when Japan invaded Korea and later Chinese Manchuria, unleashing events that would split the Korean peninsula in two and affect the whole world today.","The above coordinates are for Jaseongdae park in Busanjin, site of a Japanese castle (built in 1593 and rebuilt in 1974) and the ruins of a wall fortress.

Founder Bae Myeonghui began his owl-art-object collection at age 15. Gradually, with help from his friends and family, Bae’s collection grew to include over 2,000 owl-related objects from 70 different countries, including Japan, Poland, Ziimbabwe, and Egypt. Most of the owls are hand-crafted – there are owl paintings, pots, clocks, toys, screens, dishes… name an object that could have an owl on it, and Bae’s got it. All of these can be seen crowded in glass cases running along the walls of a single room. The Owl Museum was originally a private home, but was eventually converted by Bae and his wife into the museum as it appears today. Some visitors to the museum may be lucky enough to receive a guided tour from Bae himself. On this tour, Bae will point out some of the most notable of the museum’s owl pieces, informing visitors of their origins and how he came to acquire them.

This small village in the eastern reaches of Jeollanam-do, near Suncheon bay, is considered the best preserved example of a Korean fortress town. According to records kept during the Joseon dynasty there were over 330 of these fortress towns around the Korean peninsula. During the Japanese occupation, many of them were destroyed or dismantled. However, Naganeupseong, along with its inhabitants, remains nearly untouched, the town becoming a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2011. The site of the village has actually been inhabited since the beginning of the first millennia, the area was selected as a fortress village in the early 10th century by the Goryeo Dynasty but began to truly flourish in the late 1300s under the Joseons. 231 of the houses in Naganeupseong are still in their original condition, with thatched roofs, mortar free stone work, no plumbing, and living spaces that would be considered a little cramped by today’s Western standards. Among the people going about their ancient versions of daily lives are a smattering tourists brave enough to make the drive or take the municipal bus. Around the town are numerous and haphazard dioramas of historical Korean life in the town; including hands on traditional games of skill and papier-mâché-like models of corporal punishment and administrative proceedings. The odd dichotomy of buying a cold bottle of water from a gift shop and then peering into someone’s living “room” is a little unsettling. Other sites in the village include a large lotus pond, fortress walls and some well preserved original houses with no one living in them that allow visitors to step inside. Beyond simply wandering around as a voyeur the village does offer many activities to participate in at special times throughout the day and year. Traditional art, weaving, dyeing and music experiences are all available. There are also regular performances of traditional music and dancing. There is even a lesson in traditional Korean tea ceremony etiquette or riding in a dalguji.

134,108 Heaven Stairway,"Seoul, South Korea",A remnant of Korea's colonial past lies forgotten in a hip neighborhood in Seoul.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/108-heaven-stairway,"The 108 Heaven Stairway in Haebangchon, Seoul, is the last physical trace of Japanese colonialism in the area beneath the towering Namsan. The stairway was constructed in 1943 by Japanese authorities to pave a way to the Gyeongseong Hoguk Shrine, a Shinto shrine built to house “Japan’s war dead.” During Japanese occupation, Koreans who lived in the area were forced make the journey up the stairs to attend daily Shinto prayers. Even schoolchildren in Haebangchon were made to attend these daily rituals, in an effort to inject elements of Japanese culture into the Korean youth. Upon the expulsion of the Japanese in 1945, the shrine was torn down at the hands of the local Korean community, but the stairway was left untouched. Today, the stairs are tucked away in the neighborhood of Haebangchon, an area that until recently was considered to be derelict. Over the last few years, however, Korean millennials have begun transforming the area into a collection of hipster cafes, bars, and galleries, intermingled with crumbling residential blocks. As shoemakers are replaced by La Marzoccos, the 108 Stairway persists, hinting at the influence of Japan in moulding a complex Korean identity, at once divorced and eternally entangled with its colonial past. The 108 Stairway is a fascinating piece of colonial history that most Seoulites today walk up without realizing the significance of what lies beneath their feet. The greenery around the stairs is overgrown, the location nondescript, and the legacy known to few. It takes a little searching to find it, but it’s worth the adventure to find this important piece of Korean history that is at risk of being completely forgotten.","To get there take the train to Noksapyeong Station and head out Exit 6.

The second edition of the work, which still exists today was commissioned between 1236 and 1251, again in an effort to curb an invasion of hostile forces. Once completed, this second collection of Buddhist doctrine, law, and philosophy covered 81,258 wooden print blocks, containing 52,382,960 flawless characters. The mind-boggling work was moved to a temple known as Haeinsa in 1398 and has been housed across four separate buildings ever since, weathering centuries of time. Today the ancient birch wood tablets have all been treated to prevent any further decay and are still located in the same temple housing they have been for centuries. The building was specifically designed to keep optimum ventilation, temperature, and humidity levels, and even after hundreds of years, it’s done better than modern technology. In 1970, the blocks developed mildew after being moved to a newly built storage facility, and were promptly returned here for their long-term preservation. The collection is not only listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site but is also the 32nd National Treasure of Korea.","Start from Dongdaegu or Daegu train station, and make your way to Seongdangmot subway station (line 1 towards Daegok, exit 3) and head to the Seobu City Bus Terminal.

136,Jinkwansa Temple,"Jingwan-gil, South Korea",An all-female order shares an ancient culinary art with visitors at their mountaintop monastery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/korean-temple-cuisine,"Jinkwansa, a 12th-century Buddhist temple, sits atop a mountain in Seoul’s Bukhansan National Park. Women with shaved heads and gray robes run the entire operation. These nuns are renowned for their cuisine, which epitomizes the ancient art of Korean temple fare. It’s vegan and free of MSG, garlic, onion, and leeks. Buddhist teaching advises eschewing these ingredients, as they are believed to incite lust, among other things. Food prepared at the temple, on the other hand, is meant to further meditation. And though many monasteries follow the same principles, high-profile visitors from around the world visit Jinkwansa specifically in search of culinary wisdom. Though monastic cuisine has a deserved association with asceticism, Korean temple cuisine is far from bland. Nuns ferment, spice, dry, marinate, and pickle ingredients to create all sorts of pungent, spicy, and tangy dishes. They also ferment up to 30 different soybean pastes at a time, some of which have been aging beneath the sun for 50 years. Visitors have mentioned tasting more than 25 dishes in one meal, sampling fermented radishes, chestnut stew, crispy greens, marinated tofu, mushroom fritters, and sweet sticky rice squares sprinkled with fruit and nuts. The lattermost treat serves as the nuns’ energy-replenishing staple on head-shaving day. The female order has maintained its status as the preeminent location for temple cuisine for centuries. In Korean Buddhism, monastic mealtime is a practice referred to as Baru Gongyang, or “offering.” Diners eat in silence from a wooden bowl, using wooden chopsticks. Historically, Jinkwansa hosted suryukje, an annual ritual in which the dead are led to heaven through chanting and food ceremonies, and lauded monks stayed on-site. Thus, the nuns honed their cooking skills and reputation feeding large groups. Today, anyone can reserve a stay at Jinkwansa, take cooking classes, and tour the property. And despite the establishment’s increased popularity, nuns continue to cook with vegetables grown on temple grounds.",
137,Hwaam Cave,"Jeongseon, South Korea",Asia's largest limestone cave is home to a world of plastic goblins and gold mining history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hwaam-cave,"Located in the isolated county of Jeongseon, hours outside of Seoul, Hyaam Cave is a one of a kind mining museum and caving experience that isn’t afraid to install a bunch of cartoonish goblins to keep things interesting. Formerly known as the Cheon Po gold mine, Hwaan Cave is the largest limestone cave in Asia, and was once the fifth most productive gold mine in Korea. The mines and connected cave system are now open to the public as a mining museum and tourist attraction. Visitors enter at the top of the mine via a monorail trip (or rather laborious hike), and then descend down through the caves, passing through a number of distinctly presented sections of history and spectacle. During the first section of the tour, guests get a sober tour through the history of the mine’s techniques. Mining mannequins are staged in working positions and there are pneumatic drills that have been set up to let people “get a piece of cave.” This section also has actual gold veins that were left in the rock walls which can be viewed through magnifying glasses. Continuing down a seemingly endless, dizzying stairway that is lit with bright colored lights, things get surreal fairly quickly as one enters the “Golden Fantasy.” This section of the mine has been set up with a number of tableaus where cartoony goblin figures toil away and the history and importance of gold is told by the whimsical creatures. After leaving the fantasy creatures behind, guests are ushered into a land of pure gold (paint that is). displays and educational videos show golden bounties that look like something out of a fairy tale. Gold bars, coins, and other artifacts are presented in a spectacle of opulence. Before leaving the underworld phantasmagoria, the final attraction is the massive final cave which features some of the most spectacular stalactites and stalagmites in the country. The cave is presented as a natural cathedral with statues of the Virgin Mary, Buddha, and other religious iconography. Considering how out of the way Hyaam Cave is, it is no wonder that they feel the need to embellish their already interesting mining history with bright lights, animated characters, religion, and anything else that might draw visitors across the great distance.",

Opened in 1962, the Samcheok Mine was a huge operation employing around 3,000 people from the nearby area. As the demand for coal waned, thus did the fortunes of the huge plant, and it closed its doors in 2001. While many mines the world over have been left to rot after being shut down, becoming playgrounds for urban explorers and graffiti artists, there were grander plans for the once-thriving mine. In an effort to bring tourist dollars to the area as compensation for the income lost now that the plant was no longer in operation, the Samtan Art Mine was born. Each of the buildings, whether industrial or office, was refurbished and turned into a dynamic new space for modern art. The old shafts were cleaned up and lit to accentuate their natural beauty, and many of the coal-stained workers’ areas were converted into memorials to those who lost their lives both figuratively and literally while working on the site. Today the site is a vibrant locus of contemporary art that has not forgotten its industrial past.","Just type the phone number into your GPS or follow the directions of one of those maps you pick up at the tourist office or hotel counter,"

Vendors shovel shellfish into buyers’ bags. Gleaming fish swim in aquariums. At the Noryangjin seafood market in Seoul, the fish is as fresh as it gets. The lower floors of this massive market, which supplies around 50 percent of Seoul’s seafood, is dominated by every imaginable fruit of the sea, from giant crabs to salmon steaks to the suggestively shaped penis fish. On the upper floors, rows of restaurants cook shoppers’ purchases to their specifications or prepare a classic dish of hwe or hoe, raw uncured seafood cut fresh and enjoyed with sauces and salads. Open 24-7, the market particularly comes alive late at night when, from around 1:00 a.m. until dawn, the space buzzes with seafood auctions. On weekend evenings, meanwhile, the building bustles with locals doing their shopping and socializing over bitter soju and fresh, salty hoe. No matter what the time, wandering through Noryangjin can take hours. There are two buildings at the site: an older, open-air structure, which housed the original market, and a shiny, recently-updated building, complete with escalators, a whopping eight floors of stalls, and hundreds of vendors calling out to visitors to sample their wares. The move was controversial; some vendors refused to shift from the old building to the mall-like new structure, and you can see protest graffiti on the older warehouse. Most vendors, however, have made the move. The new building now includes some favorite spots, such as a knife shop in Section D, offering sharp tools for aspiring sashimi chefs, and a fermented seafood market, featuring salty, pungent cured fish. Noryangjin offers another, slightly more controversial delicacy: sannakji. This octopus is even fresher than other kinds of hoe, as it’s not only raw—it’s moving. To prepare the dish, chefs chop the tentacles of a live octopus, and while the resulting morsels are technically dead, nerve reactions in the tentacles keeps them squirming even as they’re eaten. There’s been some debate on the ethics of this dish, but it is undoubtedly a popular local specialty, and if you’re going to try it, Noryangjin is the best place to do so. Experienced sannakji eaters offer one tip: The tentacles’ suckers have been known to stick on the way down, so chew thoroughly.","Visitors can easily access the market from Noryangjin Station, but be aware: There are actually two different, unconnected Noryangjin stations from two different metro lines, so be sure to specify which one if you're meeting friends. Inside, the dizzying array of vendors and restaurant options may overwhelm you, but chances are the stall you buy seafood from will have its own connection to a restaurant. Follow where the vendor leads you and fishy goodness is yours."
140,Vantablack Hyundai Pavilion,"Pyeongchang, South Korea",The darkest building on Earth was built for the snow-white scenery of the 2018 Winter Olympics.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vantablack-hyundai-pavilion,"The Hyundai Pavilion stands like a “schism in space,” designed for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea. Covered in Vantablack, a material that absorbs 99.965% of light, it was like a black hole in the whiteness of the winter scenery. The curved walls of the Hyundai Pavilion stand 33 feet high and 115 feet long. But they look completely flat despite the curvature, thanks to a covering of Vantablack VBx 2, a spray-paint version of the original Vantablack created by Surrey NanoSystems in the U.K. Made using vertically aligned nanotube arrays (hence the acronym “Vanta”), Vantablack is one of the darkest artificial substances in the world. Ben Jensen, the co-founder of Surrey NanoSystems, explained the basics to CNN: “Carbon nanotubes are like very, very long blades of grass. Now you imagine if you were a human walking around in grass 1,000 feet tall how little light would get down to you. It’s like that but on a very tiny scale.” Vantablack was originally developed for satellite-borne blackbody calibration systems, but its unique properties have attracted widespread interest from various fields, including the arts. In February 2018, Asif Khan and his London-based architecture firm unveiled the Vantablack-coated Hyundai Pavilion in Pyeongchang. Studded with thousands of pinprick points of light, the otherwise blackest-of-black exterior is like a vision into the depths of outer space. The stars are on rods, all set at different depths, creating a three dimensional vision of space in which the “universe” seems to move as you walk past. Inside, meanwhile, the pavilion is completely different. The interior is a stark, bright white throughout, with a water installation with drops of water running through channels carved into the floor. The droplets represent the hydrogen that formed at the beginning of the universe, the same as contained within the stars represented in the building’s exterior. On a more prosaic and commercial level, the whole thing is a reference to Hyundai’s latest venture into the world of fuel cell-powered vehicles. Update: Though the pavilion was relocated to the Songwon Art Center, it is no longer there. However, the current exhibit there is fascinating even if it is trying to get you to know more about Hyundai and their solar cell. The area around Songwon is also worthy of a visit with various art galleries.",

This ethos of constant creation and collaboration exists throughout every aspect of the colony down to the street lights which are dim and sparse, reasoning, “How else can you enjoy the stars?” Among the many buildings in the community there are over 50 galleries, museums, cafes and restaurants supporting over 500 artists including sculptors, actors, painters, writers, and photographers. As would be expected from a town built by and for artists, each structure is built in a unique and striking architectural style, from the building meant to look like chocolate to the environmentally forward structure with tree branches growing right through the walls. Heyri Valley was envisioned and established by Korean book publisher Kim Eun-ho in 2001, bringing an almost utopian vision of an artist’s community to vibrant, thriving life.

Straddling the line is Buddhist hermit Yi Gap Yong. Yong created 120 stone pagodas below the Horse Ear Mountains in South Korea. And he did so without any tools, mortar or help from his friends. Yong came to the area to meditate in 1885 when he was only 25 years old. When he first arrived, it was a tranquil landscape, but was not yet a temple, and he was not yet an ordained monk. Lack of formal training did little to slow down his work, and over the next 30 years he built the pagodas while living alone as a hermit. Created out of circles of larger rocks, the pagodas eventually come to a point, giving them their conical peak. All made solely of local rocks from streams and rivers, some of the largest pagodas tower 30 feet above the rest of the temple complex. Yong died in 1957 nearly 100 years old. Today, over 80 of the pagodas remain and have been preserved for tourists.

Focused around the island of Jeju but with an influence that has spread to some of the smaller surrounding islands, the trend that has seen women in the regions take the place of the men as providers is believed to have begun as a way of getting around taxes. At one point, males would be highly taxed even on their meager fishing hauls, but in a loophole that speaks volume to women’s place in society at the time, females were not taxed at all. This being the case families began having women do the fishing, hauling in catches of shellfish, octopus, seaweed, and abalone. As the trend continued, islands such as Jeju saw their family units flip power structures almost completely as they free dove for sea life in the icy East China Sea. The tradition has survived for hundreds of years, but now the Haenyeo are in danger of disappearing as more and more of their daughters are choosing life in bigger mainland cities. Today the major population of the so-called Jeju Mermaids are elderly women over the age of 50 who still go out and dive as deep as 60 feet (without a breathing apparatus) to collect their family’s main source of income. There is a Haenyeo museum in Jeju-si, and a number of statues and art pieces on the island devoted to the mermaid matriarchs, so with luck, even as their numbers dwindle, the memory of their powerful contributions will not.","The cove of which the mermaids call home-base, is right next to the Volcanic crater of Seongsan Ilchulbong.

146,Jindo-Modo Landbridge,"Jindo, South Korea",Landbridge created by the South Korean version of Moses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jindo-modo-landbridge,"The story of Moses parting the Red Sea in order to save the Israelites from the Egyptians is well-known. South Koreans have a similar story. Their version is that the island of Jindo was attacked by vicious tigers. Everyone escaped, except for an unfortunate elderly woman. It is said that she prayed to the sea deity, asking the deity to open the waters and allow her to pass to the neighboring island of Modo. Her wish was granted. Today, locals and tourists on Jindo Island and Modo Island can relive the elderly woman’s crossing of the Yellow Sea. Twice a year, once in May and once in mid-June, extremely low tides open a natural causeway connecting Jindo and Modo. The causeway is almost two miles long and over 120 feet wide. On each of these days, visitors and tourists from each island traditionally walk to the middle of the causeway to meet one another and celebrate. Jindo’s “Moses Miracle” gained popularity in 1975 when a French journalist was traveling through South Korea and happened to experience the parting firsthand.",
147,War Memorial of Korea,"Seoul, South Korea","Home to more than 13,000 pieces of war memorabilia and military equipment.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/war-memorial-of-korea,"For a site which memorializes those who died during wars throughout the 20th century, the War Memorial of Korea is a surprisingly user-friendly and lighthearted environment. Exploring the decommissioned tanks and missiles ones find a strange mix of entertainment and history. The Memorial is comprised of six exhibition halls along with an outdoor gallery of war machines too massive to fit inside. All told, the site exhibits over 13,000 pieces of war memorabilia and military equipment. Opened in 1994, the building and grounds were strategically placed on the former army headquarters of Korea in the “Dragon Hill” district of Seoul. Indoors, the memorial focuses on the Korean War and Vietnam War. However, the site is not only set on remembrance. Much of the memorial is set up to get visitors to see, touch, and feel what it was like to be on the front lines in the Korean war. Visitors have a particularly special opportunity in the memorial’s Combat Experience Room. Surrounded by stimuli, visitors are thrown onto the battlefield in the Korean War, as audiovisual effects, vibration and even the smell of gunpowder overpower the senses and virtually recreate the war. Besides the interactivity inside the memorial, the grounds, littered with old tanks that you can walk directly up to, has a strong air of national sentiment. Patriotic Korean music plays, and despite the weapons petting zoo feel, the massive warplanes, tanks and heavy artillery have a clear message for visitors and nationals alike: don’t mess with the ROK.","War Memorial of Korea is located in Yongsan-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, South Korea."

While most ships in the Sea of Japan hover atop the sea, the Sun Cruise Resort and Yacht stands dozens of feet higher, perched on a rocky cliff. Believed to be the world’s first hotel designed as a cruise ship, the Sun Cruise Resort and Yacht is over 500 feet long and nearly 150 feet tall. Complete with 211 rooms, six restaurants, a sculpture garden, and a volleyball court, the giant misplaced boat sits peculiarly atop a tall cliff to give the impression that it’s run aground. The resort is known throughout the region for its eye-catching appeal, and it takes full advantage by playing the sounds of bird calls and oceanic waves to mimic the actual experience of sailing on a cruise liner without the consequential seasickness. The boat hotel also features a rotating bar to give guests a panoramic view of Jeongdongjin’s famed sunrises. In May of 2017, a second Sun Cruise Resort and Yacht will land ashore. Although some would say that the boat hotel idea is going a bit overboard, it seems to be successfully taking the helm in bringing the sea to the shore.",
149,Hyangwonjeong Pavilion,"Seoul, South Korea",A unique structure located on the grounds of one of five grand palaces that were built by the Joseon dynasty.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hyangwonjeong-pavilion,"Hyangwonjeong is a small, hexagonal, two-story pavilion found in the grounds of Gyeongbokgung. The pavilion was built on the orders of King Gojong around 1873 and it is thought to have acted as a place of leisure and relaxation for the Joseon Dynasty kings and their family members. Following excavation work carried out in 2019, it was found that Hyangwonjeong had the traditional Korean system of heated floors called ondol. Pavilions of this period were often equipped with ondol heating systems, but what makes Hyangwonjeong unique is how the smoke travelled along the sides of the first floor, instead of going through the middle. The pavilion was constructed on an artificial island in the center of a lake called Hyangwonji. The lake is home to many large, beautifully colored carp and in season lots of lotus flowers. A bridge, Chwihyanggyo, connects the island and the pavilion to the rest of the palace grounds. Hyangwonjeong can be translated as “pavilion of far-reaching fragrance,” while Chwihyanggyo translates as “bridge intoxicated with fragrance.” Chwihyanggyo was originally located on the north side of the island, and was the longest bridge constructed purely of wood during the Joseon dynasty. Unfortunately, the bridge was destroyed during the Korean War. The bridge was reconstructed in its present form on the south side of the island in 1953, but was relocated to its original location on the north side during reconstruction work completed in 2019.",
150,Metro Farm,"Seoul, South Korea",Some of the freshest vegetables in Seoul are grown in a subway station.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/metro-farm-subway-seoul,"A subway station in a skyscraper-studded metropolis might seem like an unlikely place to grow leafy greens, but that’s exactly what South Korean tech startup Farm8 has been doing since September 2019. Situated in Sangdo Station on Line 7 of the Seoul Metro, the company’s Metro Farm is a sleek, glass-encased plant nursery housing rows upon rows of hydroponic growing trays. Under the glow of LED lights and the attention of an automated tech network, 30 varieties of organic edible plants, including microgreens, flowers, and sprouts, thrive. According to Farm8, the subterranean vertical farm is 40 times as efficient as its more traditional counterpart. Even though the agricultural experiment occupies a modest 394 square meters of space, it produces around 30 kilograms of fresh vegetables daily. Most of those go directly into the salad bowls and smoothies of the 1,000-odd customers who frequent Farm8’s adjacent café. “We want to change the perception of farming,” Lee Hwang-myung, senior manager of the project, told Rest of the World. “We want to encourage people to see agriculture as something not of the past but as part of the future.” Interest in urban farming has been on the rise for some time in Asia, where innovators in some of the most densely populated cities in the world are seeking ways to reduce carbon emissions and ensure food security for their inhabitants. Since 2015, more than 60 urban farms have cropped up everywhere from former helicopter pads to the rooftops of shopping malls in Hong Kong. In Bangkok, the rooftop of Thammasat University is home to a sprawling 22,000-square-meter green oasis. In Seoul, the Metro Farm has already proven such a hit that Farm8 has installed four others in subway stations around the city. The serene, underground landscapes serve as both a viable food source and as promotion for the startup, which offers various tiers of its vertical farms to corporations and private individuals looking to make their space—and the world—a little greener.","Prices in Seoul can be steep, but the organic salads and vegetable juices at Metro Farm's café are kept intentionally affordable. More than 7 million people pass through Seoul's subway system each day, so try to avoid rush hour if possible when stopping by the farm."

A dream that one day, on the color dotted hills of Jeongseon, music and architecture would melt together in brotherhood. It was a dream which Korean architect Moon Hoon turned into a reality at Rock It Suda. Before Rock it Suda became an architectural icon, it was simply the name of an amateur rock band from Seoul. A band whose bass player asked Hoon to come up with a design for some weekend homes. Homes in which urban dwellers could liberate themselves from the fuzz of the city. Homes in which weekends would turn into rivers, flowing through time and design with a stunning landscape and the band’s music as the natural soundtrack. Moon took to work creating a surreal cluster of pensions (the Korean term for weekend house) and the Rock It Suda estates were born. Each of the six dreamlike units is based on a simple inspiration, respectively “Spain,”,”Barbie,” “Stealth,” “Ferrari,” “Cave,” and “Tradition. The interior of each space is designed like something out of an ultra-modern dream with every angle a bit off and strange, angular protrusions on every surface. However, despite the mad setting, the location offers all the modern conveniences like jacuzzis and of course, a stage for live music. After Rock It Suda was completed, the band that shared the space’s name would come up to the space and spend each weekend jamming for the guests. however, as time went on, the band’s appearances dwindled and now the space is simply a shock of colorful futurism in the midst of the Korean mountains.",
153,Cheomseongdae,"Gyeongju, South Korea",Numerical symbolism abound at East Asia's oldest observatory.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cheomseongdae,"Numbers are important at Cheomseongdae, the oldest astronomical observatory in East Asia. Though the observatory’s age (it dates back to the 7th century Silla Kingdom of modern-day South Korea) can serve to obscure the original purposes of its design, some have claimed there is numerical significance imbued within every brick. Cheomseongdae, which roughly translates to “star-gazing tower,” is a cylindrical structure composed of 362 granite blocks, which some claim represents the 362 days of the lunar year. In total, there are 27 circular layers of stones, a number believed to reference the 27th ruler of the Silla Kingdom, Queen Seondeok, during whose reign the observatory was built. This numbers game continues further, as a window is placed strategically with 12 layers of stones above and 12 layers below, symbolizing the months of the year or the signs of the Zodiac. And if that weren’t enough symbolism for one small building, the four-sided base is also thought to represent the seasons. But regardless of the hidden numerical messages, the observatory is interesting in its own right. As one of the oldest scientific sites in the world, Cheomseongdae provides a window into how astronomy was conducted many hundreds of years ago. In those times, the line between astronomy and astrology was considerably blurred, and “astronomers” often reported their findings to the king’s court so that various decisions of governance could be made based on celestial activities. Despite its use for astrological predictions, Cheomseongdae was also the site of more traditional astronomical research. From the top of the tower, state-appointed astronomers made continuous observations 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, developing the ability to predict eclipses and chart the trajectories of comets. In fact, Cheomseongdae’s importance, in both the histories of Korea and astronomy, earned it the distinction of national treasure in 1962 and its image can even be found on Korean coins.",

Suguksa Temple sits in an assuming neighborhood in northwestern Seoul where tourists are few and far between. When the light catches the golden temple just right, it’s a glorious sight. The temple was built in 1459 after Crown Prince Uigyeong died at the age of 20. His father, King Sejo, had the temple, originally named Jeonginsa, built in the prince’s honor. In 1712, the temple was designated as the guardian temple for the tombs of King Sukjong and Queen Inhyeon buried at nearby Seooreung Royal Tomb grounds. Around that time, the temple’s name was changed to Suguksa, or “the temple that protects the country.”After a fire at the temple, it was left to ruin for some time until 1900 when it was rebuilt. At that time, King Sunjong became ill and King Gojong, his father, asked Monk Wol Cho to pray for him. King Sunjong became well again and because the monk’s prayers seemed to be quite effective, the king was impressed and wanted to give him riches. The monk declined the offer and instead asked for a gold-covered Buddhist sanctuary that ordinary citizens could visit. Today, the Buddhist temple shines with a special golden paper that has been applied to the front, while the other three sides have been painted gold.","Note that this is an active temple so be respectful when you visit, keep quiet, and remember that this is a holy site.

155,Kosik the talking elephant,"Yongin-si, South Korea",Seoul amusement park boasts a Korean-speaking pachyderm.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kosik-talking-elephant,"In 2006, keepers at Seoul’s Everland amusement park/zoo complex were surprised to hear a voice coming from inside the elephant enclosure. Kosik, a 16-year-old elephant, had learned to talk (in Korean of course) by putting its trunk in its mouth and mimicking the words it heard from its caretakers: “yes,” “no,” “lie down,” “sit down,” and four other phrases. Perhaps surprisingly, Kosik is not the first talking elephant on record. In the 1970s, a pachyderm called Batyr kept in Kazhakstan’s Karaganda Zoo also learned to speak (in Russian), supposedly stringing together phrases like “Batyr is good” as well as verbs like “drink” and “give.” He also appeared on Soviet television, once swearing on a live broadcast. Though it has been shown that elephants do indeed have a sense of self awareness and are intelligent problem solvers and tool users, the question of whether the elephants are capable of expressive speech (as opposed to straight mimicry) has yet to be fully resolved. In the meantime, visitors flock to Kosik’s enclosure, hoping to catch a few words.","From exit 1 of Yangjae Stn. (Subway Line 3) get bus 1500.

156,Bridge of No Return,"Paju, South Korea",The site of many tense prisoner exchanges across the Military Demarcation Line between North and South Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bridge-of-no-return,"Between 1953 and 1976, the Bridge of No Return was the scene of tense prisoner exchanges and highly charged incidents between North Korea and South Korea. The bridge crosses the Military Demarcation Line, separating the two sides of the DMZ, the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Starting at the end of the Korean War in 1953, prisoner exchanges were made across this bridge. Its name comes from the ultimatum given to prisoners of war before they crossed: They could stay in the country where they were formerly held captive or they could return to their homeland, but once they stepped over the line, there was no going back. The first major prison exchange, known as Operation Little Switch, took place in April 1953. The United Nations Command (UNC) exchanged 6,030 North Korean prisoners for 605 UNC prisoners, most of whom were sick or wounded. The fraught exchange was a success, and soon led to the start of Operation Big Switch. From August to December that year, 70,183 North Koreans and 5,640 Chinese POWs were exchanged for 12,773 UNC POWs from various nations, including 7,862 South Koreans, 3,597 Americans, and 945 British. Much to the bewilderment of the UN, 23 Americans and one Briton declined repatriation. The next major incident came in 1968 following the capture of the USS Pueblo by DPRK naval forces in international waters off North Korea. The captain and crew were held for 11 months. They were finally released and allowed to walk across the bridge, but only while a forced confession from the captain was blasted out over loudspeakers. It was the last prisoner exchange across the Bridge of No Return. Tensions again peaked, this time with fatal consequences, in August 1976. Two United States Army officers went out to trim a poplar tree in the Joint Security Area, which was obscuring the view between checkpoints near the bridge. When the U.S. soldiers went out to trim it, they were set upon and killed by axe-wielding North Korean soldiers, in what is now known as the Korean axe murder incident. The North Koreans built a new bridge following this incident, and the Bridge of No Return was never used again, at least not for prisoner exchanges. But it did still hit the headlines occasionally. In 1993, President Bill Clinton walked part of the way over the bridge, to within 10 feet of the demarcation line. He was naturally heavily guarded by a Secret Service escort, and carefully watched by AK-47-carrying North Korean soldiers on the other side. More recently, in August, 2016, the United Nations Command accused the North Korean army of planting land mines near the northern end of the landmark bridge. It was the first time North Korea had been seen planting mines near the bridge since the armistice of 1953. Now unused and barred by bollards at either end, the bridge nevertheless remains a potent symbol of the fraught history between the two countries, and between the United States and the North Korean regime. The bridge is located inside the Joint Security Area of the DMZ, and can be visited—but not crossed—by adventuresome tourists.","Visitors hoping to visit the Joint Security Area must sign up for an organized, approved tour of the DMZ that includes the JSA. Note that not all DMZ tours include the JSA, and that tour itineraries are often subject to last-minute changes based on security conditions."

158,Sewoon Sangga (Sewoon Plaza),"Seoul, South Korea",Its humdrum facade only adds to its electrifying appeal: a rooftop with panoramic views of a shapeshifting metropolis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sewoon-sangga-sewoon-plaza,"Once a symbol of Korean modernization, Sewoon Sangga, a.k.a. Sewoon Plaza, was named to mean a place that “gathers the energy of the world.” No wonder, then, that the megastructure—originally comprised of eight bulky buildings stretching for more than half a mile—bizarrely resembles a concrete power strip plugged into the heart of Seoul. Rewind to early 1945, toward the end of World War II and final year of Japanese colonial rule of Korea, and your curiosity about Sewoon Sangga’s stretched-out structure is quelled. The Imperial Japanese government hastily cleared a more than 160-f00t-wide, nearly half-mile-long strip of inhabited land to prevent the spread of fires in the event of potential United States firebombing raids on Seoul. Then, with the Korean War, the evacuated lot turned into a shantytown for refugees and homeless people. But not for long. During the period of rapid postwar development in the late ‘60s, people in Seoul were awestruck—with wonder or dread of being displaced—by a novel plan to construct “a city within a city” on the deprived land. In fact, Sewoon Sangga was the first mixed-use residential and commercial complex in the country. Designed by Korea’s foremost architect Kim Swoo-Geun, it included a luxury apartment, a one-stop shopping mall, a school, and even a library for its residents. Soon enough, however, its novelty faded. Over time, the brutalist megastructure transformed into a magnet for seekers of porn and pirated media, an arcade outlet, and mainly an all-out electronics market during the ‘80s. There’s even a famous joke that Sewoon Sangga has everything you need to build a tank or nuclear submarine! Fast forward to today, and the megastructure, once on the brink of complete demolition (only one of the buildings was destroyed in 2009), is shifting its form yet again. This time, it’s being dubbed as “Makercity Sewoon” in light of a recent urban renewal project to revitalize the historic complex and to deliberately prevent gentrification—the first project of its kind in Seoul. Sewoon Sangga is now becoming a hub where you can find veteran artisans coexist and collaborate with young makers and entrepreneurs. Its floors are lined with an eclectic range of storefronts that include old-school printing shops, VR and robotics labs, classic eateries, hip cafes, and community spaces that seemingly promote maker culture. Not to be missed from its regeneration is Sewoon Sangga’s newly renovated public rooftop. The 25,058-square-foot space has lounging areas perfect for slowing down, a blooming urban garden, and, best of all, dramatic views of downtown Seoul you won’t find anywhere else. Depending on where you stand, you can see Jongmyo Shrine, Bugaksan Mountain, the industrial Euljiro neighborhood (sadly on the verge of being demolished), Namsan Seoul Tower, Gwangjang Market (arguably the best food market in Seoul), Cheonggyecheon, and more. Its rooftop is also a place that makes you ponder about the city’s ever-changing skyline, and whether Sewoon Sangga will keep transforming until it lives up to its utopian namesake.","Sewoon’s rooftop is open to the public from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. There’s an elevator in front of the entrance facing Jongmyo Shrine. Also, be sure to stop by the tiny, but worthwhile Sewoon Electronics Museum on the third floor (descriptions are in Korean)."

The temple survived the Seven Year War largely unfazed, and was used as a refuge during the early Joseon Dynasty. Its resilience and ancient history has left it abundant with treasures, including manuscripts made with liquid gold and silver, bronze-tipped pagodas, of which only three remain in the world, and Chinese junipers planted by independence leader and scholar Kim Ku. Centuries-worth of ornate gates, paintings of dragons and saints, golden statues, watchful Bodhisattvas and a myriad of Buddhas are scattered about the carefully manicured grounds.

The islets are largely uninhabitable as they are mostly rocky with a total land area of just 0.18 square kilometers. But when Japan claimed the islands, the ensuing upsurge of anger resulted in a mother and son slicing off their own fingers and a man setting himself on fire. The islands may have been first conquered by Korea as long ago as the 6th century, but Japan claims that this was a different island, or even a non-existent one. Korea formally claimed the rocks in 1900, with Japan doing the same five years later. The rocks have been known by various names over the years, further clouding the issue of sovereignty. The English name comes from Le Liancourt, a French whaling ship that nearly crashed on the island in 1849. Though the tiny islands may seem irrelevant, the ownership is crucial to claiming the maritime boundary and the fishing and resource rights that accompany it. There are currently only two permanent residents on the island, Korean nationals Kim Seong Do, an octopus farmer, and wife Kim Shin Yeol. They are assisted by various support staff including 37 policemen and three lighthouse keepers. But Sung-do died in 2018, and now Shin-yeol is the only one left. The island was off-limits to tourists for many years, but now over 100,000 tourists visit the island every year. There was even a wedding on the islands in 2005. On February 22, 2005, Japan’s Shimane prefecture announced a “Takeshima Day” to celebrate 100 years of the annexation of the islands. Such action caused fury in Korea, where the memory of the brutal Japanese occupation still lingers. As well as the aforementioned self-mutilation and immolation, Koreans protested their anger by decapitating pheasants outside the Japanese Embassy. The issue is not one likely to be resolved soon, but South Korea can count on support from an unlikely source. In a rare and unexpected move, rival North Korea has supported South Korea’s claim to the islands.","The nearest land is Korean island Ulleung-do at a distance of 87 km.

As mayor of Suwon in the 1990s and early 2000s, he led an effort to clean and beautify the city’s public toilets. He later founded the World Toilet Association, dedicated to doing the same for the world. Appropriately, he became known as “Mr. Toilet” by reputation. In 2007, in honor of the founding of the WTA, he demolished his home and had a new one made, designed by Go Gi-wong to look like a giant toilet. It was Sim’s dream house. He even named it Haewoojae, which translates to “a house to satisfy anxiety,” which is how restrooms are referred to in Korean temples. After he died, the house was donated to the city and turned into a toilet museum. The house itself is the largest toilet sculpture in Korea, and has two floors of exhibitions about how important toilets are to the health of a society. Toilet-themed art is exhibited inside the museum and around on the grounds, much of which, including a giant golden pile of poop, make for great photo ops.

From this stretch of golden-white sand, they enter the sea to catch waves in one of the country’s best under-the-radar surfing spots. After Japan ceded control of Korea toward the end of World War II, the country was sliced in half, with Soviet Russia taking control of the North and the United States occupying the south. This invisible line, drawn along the 38th parallel north, divided the formerly united country into two hostile pieces. It remained the barrier between North and South Korea until it was replaced by the Military Demarcation Line after the end of the Korean War. Though no longer part of the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the 38th parallel north still circles through an extremely politically charged part of the world. Yet surprisingly, it also runs across a sliver of beachy paradise, which is home to a military base, rest stop, and a small but thriving surf community. In-the-know Seoul residents make the three-hour journey on the weekends to take advantage of the clean break at the 38th Parallel Beach. They’re often joined by expats and other foreign surfers who were lured to the spot by whispers of superb waves. Though the military members marching nearby and barbed wire fences poking above the sand are stark reminders of the area’s lasting tensions, the surfers don’t let it kill their beachy vibes. They descend upon the remote beach throughout the year, sometimes wading through thick snow to catch waves in one of the most unique surfing experiences in the world.","To get to the 38th Parallel Beach from Seoul, take a bus from the Dong-Seoul bus terminal to Hajodae.

Those who travel to Hampyeong for the Expo itself get to witness the whole town transform, as the whole area is adorned with butterfly lights, decorations, and fluttering wing motifs alongside the real deal.",
164,Dorasan Station,"Paju, South Korea","South Korea's largely symbolic, barely used gateway to the North.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dorasan-station,"If you’ve ever felt both deeply sad and profoundly hopeful at the same time, then you have some sense of what it feels like to stand inside Dorasan Station, South Korea’s largely symbolic transportation hub just 650 meters from the southern boundary of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The sleek, modern train station was completed in 2002, and for a short time, freight trains did travel back and forth between the Kaesong Industrial Complex, on the North Korean side of the border, and Dorasan. This was during the peak of then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung’s Sunshine Policy, which sought more cordial relations with the North. But it didn’t take long for tensions between the two nations to flare up once again, effectively shutting down the station and rendering it little more than a curiosity for tourists. The station connects to a much larger customs and immigration operation, including several warehouses and inspection bays. Today these buildings sit empty and unused. Inside the terminal, signs point non-existent Pyongyang-bound passengers to board trains that never come. An aspirational route map for a proposed Trans-Asian Railway system looms large across one wall. A souvenir shop in the corner, selling DMZ-themed coffee mugs and locally sourced chocolates, is one of the few hubs of any activity. In the South, the hope is that one day soon, the two Koreas might begin to trade with each other again. Should that day ever come, Dorasan sits ready and waiting.","Since Dorasan Station is located inside the Civilian Control Zone (CCZ), it is highly recommended that you see it as part of an organized tour of the DMZ and surrounding area. Korail also offers a handful of DMZ-Train departures from Yongsan, but they too recommend joining an organized tour. Book any DMZ tour well in advance, and make sure to bring your passport."
165,Jjajang Myeon Museum,"Incheon, South Korea",This tiny museum immortalizes the birthplace of an iconic Chinese-Korean noodle dish.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jjajang-myeon-museum,"A staple of Chinese-Korean cuisine and the dish of choice for sad South Korean singles, jjajang myeon is so beloved, it’s inspired an entire museum. Lovers of the noodles turned one of the first restaurants to serve it into an altar to the dish, complete with displays about its history and temptingly lifelike sculptures of the star carbs themselves. Home to South Korea’s only official Chinatown, the seaport town of Incheon is also the birthplace of one of the country’s most beloved foods: jjajang myeon, or noodles in black bean sauce. Created by an enterprising Chinese immigrant and loosely based on a Shandong Province noodle and ground pork dish, jjajang myeon is now synonymous with Chinese-Korean delivery. It’s also the dish over which black-clad South Korean singles meet and drown their sorrows every April 14, the country’s “Black Day” for the unhappily unpartnered. The museum features displays on the dish’s origin, a collection of its most popular packaged forms, and an eerily lifelike sculpture of a table of happy diners enjoying a noodley feast. While a small museum—tourists report taking only an hour to see the whole thing—it’s certain to leave you with an appetite. After touring the museum (which doesn’t actually serve the noodles), you can head over to one of the neighborhood’s many jjajang myeon joints for a sample of the real thing.","The museum is open 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Admission costs 1,000 won for adults and 500 won for children."
166,Wongaksa Pagoda,"Seoul, South Korea",This pagoda was once the central feature of a Buddhist temple that no longer exists.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wongaksa-pagoda,"Wongaksa Pagoda is a 12-meter (40-foot) pagoda located in Seoul, South Korea. The 10-story marble building is hidden away in Tapgol Park, in the center of the busy city. The pagoda was constructed in 1467 as a part of Wongaksa Temple, which King Sejo had established two years earlier on the site of an older temple.  An inscription on the upper part of the pagoda states it was built in the 13th year of the king’s reign. The temple was closed and turned into a kisaeng house, then the site was turned into government offices. The pagoda and a memorial stele commemorating the foundation of Wongaksa were the sole surviving structures.  Even, they had a close call in the 16th century during the Imjin War. The top portion of the pagoda was pulled down and lay on the ground—it would not be replaced until 1947. In 1897, the financial advisor to King Gojong, was authorized to turn the area into Seoul’s first public park, now known as Tapgol Patk. In 1962, the pagoda was designated a National Treasure of Korea.  This title acknowledged an object’s value as either a tangible treasure, artifact, site, or building which is recognized by the government as having exceptional artistic, cultural and historical value to the country.  This explains why the pagoda is hidden in a somewhat ugly glass case that almost makes it look like a construction site. The pedestal supporting the pagoda is three-tiered. The first three stories follow the shape of the base and the next seven stories are squares. The pagoda is richly engraved, with images of dragons, lions, phoenixes, lotus blossoms, and religious icons including Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and the Four Heavenly Kings. The pagoda was carved to look as if it was made from wood despite being constructed from marble. The use of marble is in itself unusual, as most Korean pagodas are made of granite. Despite its lofty-sounding title, the pagoda seems to be generally uncrowded, even though it is in a free public park.",
167,Wolji Pond,"Gyeongju, South Korea",This human-made pond is part of a Korean palace complex first built in the 7th century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wolji-pond,"Wolji is an artificial pond that was originally located near the Silla palace called Banwolseong. The pond was part of the complex, constructed on the orders of King Munmu in 674. The pond measures 200 meters from east to west and 180 meters from north to south. When viewed from above, it has an unusual shape that some say represents the outline of the country at the time of construction, acting as a kind of watery map of Korea. The pond contains three small islands and the surrounding area has a manufactured landscape of 12 small hills to the northeast. This pond was referred to as Anapji during the Goryeo and Joseon eras. In the 1980s, a pottery shard was found with the word wolji carved on it, which translates to “pond that reflects the moon.” It was decided that this must be the true name of the pond, and the site was renamed to Donggung and Wolji. Donggung and Wolji was a secondary palace used by the crown prince of the Silla Kingdom. Rare animals were brought in to the area to create an exotic garden fit for royalty. It also served as a banquet site for important national events. There is mention of a royal reception held by King Gyeongsun, in 931, by which time the Silla Kingdom was beginning to crumble. After the fall of Silla, the pond fell into disrepair for many centuries. In 1974, as part of the renovation project of historic sites around the city, Wolji was dredged and rebuilt. During the excavation, almost 33,000 artifacts were found in and around the pond. The abundance of discoveries include roof tiles, architectural materials, pottery, gilt bronze Buddha figures, jewelry, and small everyday items. These objects offer an insight to Buddhist art and everyday life during the Silla era. These are held in a special exhibition at the nearby Gyeongju National Museum. Research revealed that the pond had been surrounded by stone walls, and that five buildings once stood on the west and south sides. Some of these buildings are now recreated at the edge of the pond, including one that houses a diorama showing what the area would have looked like at its height. Waterway systems were also discovered. The city government tried to undertake further restoration work in 2018 but it was suspended because UNESCO opposed the project. Viewing the pond at night is a must, the pond and pavilions are lit up and it makes for a beautiful area to wander.",

While neither Thomas Edison nor the Gramophone have any historical or cultural connection to the strongly nationalistic nation that typically hosts little in the way of permanent Western exhibitions, this is advertised as the third largest collection of Edison inventions and artifacts in the world. It is also home to an impressively large collection of gramophones. Admission includes a mandatory tour only available in Korean, but comes highly recommended as the guide takes the time to demonstrate hundred-year-old music boxes and recordings. Playing a selection of the more than 150,000 recording available in this museum allows the small crowd to experience what records sounded like when portable music required gears and hand-cranks. The tour takes time to showcase a few Edison inventions, but mostly focuses on music and hardware in its original forms: organs, vinyl, and wax cylinders. The rest of the collection showcases Edison’s long, eclectic and accomplished career. The Edison Invention Hall includes a large display of stereos, toys, record players, light bulbs, radios, televisions, film cameras, projectors, stock tickers and home appliances from the beginnings of consumer culture. The Hall houses more than 850 inventions. The entire collection was brought together by an eccentric curator, Seon Seong-Mok, whose admiration for Edison led him to Photoshop several photographs that show him standing with Edison, his arms around him.","From the Gangneung Train Station, take bus no. 300 or 303 and get off at Gyeongpodorip Park. From the Gangneung Bus Terminal, take bus no. 202 or 302. Expect the trip to take between 10 and 20 minutes from either station."

An important relic of Korean culture, this village was designed in Joseon period-style architecture and is home to many folk traditions. The village is organized around the geomantic guidelines of pungsu and is designed in the shape of a lotus flower. The village was placed on the UNESCO list as a World Heritage Site in 2010. The village’s various architectural designs showcase techniques that have been lost elsewhere in South Korea due to the country’s rapid modernization. Wonjijeongsa Pavilion and the Byeongsan Confucian School are two of the village’s most notable structures. Many of the buildings are also listed as Treasures or Important Folklore Materials. The village is located in a beautiful region near a river bend. It’s the ideal location to take a stroll and admire history.",

This site is the burial ground of two kings and a queen of the Joseon Dynasty. The westernmost area of the park is occupied by Seolleung, the tomb of King Seongjong who died in 1494. On this tomb are engravings of the twelve zodiac signs and the mound is surrounded by various sculptures of civil and military servants. A small shrine is located nearby. The tomb of Queen Jeonghyeon, Seongjong’s wife, was constructed after her death in 1530 to the east of Seolleung. It is surrounded by a stone fence. The easternmost tomb, known as Jeongneung, belongs to King Jungjong who died in 1544 and was the son of Seongjong. Originally buried at another site in Goyang, north of Seoul, he was moved here to be closer to his father. This tomb is also surrounded by some sculptures and a small temple. During the Japanese Invasions of Korea in the late 16th-century, the tombs were severely damaged but were later repaired. When the site started to become engulfed by the expanding city of Seoul during the 1960s, the area was restored and is now a wonderful city park.",The site is closed on Mondays.

172,Jusanji Pond,"Cheongsong, South Korea",Trees emerge from the surface of this small man-made reservoir.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jusanji-pond,"Tucked among the trees in the forest outside of Cheongsong, South Korea, this small body of water has drawn visitors from all over the world. Jusanji Pond is an artificial pond created in 1720 in a forested area that in 1976 became the Juwangsan National Park. The pond was built to serve as a reservoir that could provide a steady supply of fresh water to the lower agricultural land. It’s fairly diminutive, by most standards. When full, Jusanji Pond measures 100 meters (328 feet) in length and 50 meters (164 feet) in width, with a maximum depth of eight meters (26 feet). The pond’s real claim to fame is the beauty with which the nearby centennial trees have encroached on its banks. Centuries of growth have resulted in a mesmerizing interplay of water and branches, and the fog that often envelops the pond when the weather is cold only adds to its charm. The mystic aura of Jusanji Pond did not escape Korean director Kim Ki-duk, who used it as a central element in the 2003 movie Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter… and Spring. The plot of the movie revolves around the life of Buddhist monk that grew up at the floating temple. Long sequences of Jusanji Pond in different seasons are used to illustrate the stages in the monk’s life. A floating temple was built for the movie, but it was eventually dismantled to retain the natural atmosphere of the place. The best time to visit Jusanji Pond is spring and fall, when the trees in bloom and the dying leaves respectively are perfectly mirrored on the placid water of the pond. However, visiting the pond in winter also has its perks, with the fog, silhouette of the trees and frozen waters bestowing on the pond a spectral ambiance. Although it is never dry, the pond reaches its lowest levels of water in the summer, the least favorable season for a visit.",
173,Korean Axe Murder Incident Memorial,"Paju, South Korea",A monument to the two U.S. officers killed by North Korean troops while trying to trim a poplar tree.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/korean-axe-murder-incident-monument,"On August 18, 1976, two U.S. Army officers entered the Korean Demilitarized Zone to trim a poplar tree that was blocking the view of United Nations observers. When they were confronted by a group of North Korean soldiers, the situation quickly escalated, with tragic results. Captain Arthur Bonifas and First Lieutenant Mark Barrett had entered the Joint Security Area in the DMZ accompanied by Captain Kim of the South Korean Army, five Korean Service Corps (KSC) personnel, and 11 other men. Due to Joint Security Area regulations, not all the men were armed, but the KSC workers were carrying axes for pruning the branches of the poplar tree. Shortly after the workers began trimming the tree, a group of 15 North Korean soldiers appeared. In command of the group was Senior Lieutenant Pak Chul, a man the UNC soldiers referred to as Lt. Bulldog due to the numerous confrontations they’d had with him in the past. The North Koreans watched the men work for about 15 minutes, but then Pak decided to get involved. He aggressively told the UNC to stop pruning the tree, claiming, somewhat spuriously, that Kim Il Sung, the first Supreme Leader of North Korea, had planted the poplar himself, and personally supervised its growth. Captain Bonifas ignored Pak, turning his back on him and telling his detail to carry on. Pak sent a runner back over the nearby Bridge of No Return, which spanned the Military Demarcation Line between North and South Korea. Within minutes, a guard truck rumbled over the bridge, carrying about 20 more North Korean soldiers, all carrying crowbars and clubs. Pak once again ordered Bonifas to stop the pruning, and Bonifas once again turned his back on the bullish North Korean. According to a report by the U.S. Army War College written the year after the incident, Pak then proceeded to carefully take off his wristwatch, which he folded in a handkerchief and placed in his pocket. He then gave a simple order, in Korean: “Kill the bastards.” Pak’s men picked up the axes that had been dropped by the tree-trimmers, and attacked the two U.S. soldiers. Bonifas was beaten to death by at least five North Koreans. Barrett ran into a tree-filled depression, but was cornered and then hacked to death by a succession of axe-wielding North Koreans. The attack, which was over in minutes, was captured on video and in photographs taken by UNC guards from their observation posts. The Korean axe murder incident led to Operation Paul Bunyan, which took place three days later. The operation, named after a giant lumberjack in American folklore, was a carefully considered show of force by the U.S. and South Korea, one calculated not to escalate into outright war. The target of the operation: the poplar tree. On August 21, Task Force Vierra rolled into the Joint Security Area. The convoy of 23 American and South Korean vehicles stopped by the tree and felled it within 42 minutes. They were watched by at least 150 North Korean soldiers, who didn’t react. The stump of the poor poplar tree was deliberately left standing as a reminder to the North Koreans. Then, in 1987, it was uprooted and replaced by a stone monument with a brass plate dedicated to the two soldiers who lost their lives.","Most DMZ tours these days do not include this memorial, due to its sensitive location inside the JSA. If seeing it up close is a priority for you, you'll want to contact a tour company that offers customized tours, and keep on top of potential JSA closures and security statuses."

Built on a precipice with a mountain at its back and the sun and sea at its front, this temple is one of the few seaside temples in Korea. As you enter the temple grounds, you’ll walk past a dozen or so vendors dishing up delectable street foods (meats, breads, and hotteok in season and ice cream year-round), selling Buddhist bric-a-brac and, of course, a few cafes. Towering statues of the Korean Zodiac face stunning cherry trees. Huge steles and statues of Buddhist importance, such as the dharma wheel, dot the path down to the Traffic Safety Prayer Pagoda. Whether you circumambulate the pagoda or pass it by, the main gate will be immediately to your left. The winding stairs that lead down to the temple are lined with one of the area’s largest collections of stone lanterns. You can make a stop at any of a number of specific Buddha statues that promise good grades, more sons and a variety of other benefits with a belly rub and donation. (Just read the translations carefully so you don’t mistakenly donate for the wrong blessing.) At the bottom of 108 stairs, you can veer left to look over the ocean, buy a drink or snack, and get a great view of the temple, or you can continue straight to walk over the stone bridge to the temple itself.

Ancient stone stairs lead to the temple’s entrance, where one of Korea’s most famed national treasures was found—a hexagonal sarira reliquary said to contain the Buddha Shaykamuni’s ashes. Stroll around the grounds to find the shrine to Monk Ado, where you can light incense or leave an offering, and explore the Geuknak-jeon (Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 466), which was built in the mid-1600s and houses a gilded 129-centimeter (50 inch) Buddha statue made from juniper wood. The stunning five-story pagoda, just opposite Geuknak-jeon, is one of the oldest and most unique in the country.

According to legend, a young man’s father was deathly ill and he couldn’t afford the medicine that could save him. The young man worked as a servant for a rich man for one month in order to raise the money.  Even though he did a good job, the rich man refused to pay his salary. The young man was distraught that he could not save his father. As he sat lamenting the situation, a monk spoke with him and reminded him that his father had been ill without care for a month. The young man rushed home only to learn that his father had already passed away. The young man was determined to give his father a proper burial, but while carrying the coffin he slipped and dropped it into the ocean. The grieving son felt so bad about failing his father that he sat still in one place without eating or drinking until he turned to stone. These rocks later rose from the ocean to represent him and his father. Gatbawi is a natural sandstone-and-tafoni formation, and is considered one of the “8 famous spots of Mokpo”. Today, visitors can climb on hiking trails behind the rocks, but the only way to get a good look at them is from the ocean side, either from the Bohaenggyo foot bridge that circles the formation or by tour boat.","Take Bus 15 from the train station and get off at Gatbawi. Head toward the ocean, which is visible from the bus stop. Take the bridge to see the rocks from the ocean side."
