0,Kaplica Czaszek: The Chapel of Skulls,"Kudowa-Zdrój, Poland","The walls and ceiling of this Polish church are decorated with thousands of skulls, with another 21,000 skeletons just below.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaplica-czazek-chapel-skulls,"In 1776, while America was declaring its independence from England, and bodies were piling up in the American revolutionary war, a priest and grave digger in the small Polish town of Czermna, (a kilometer to the north of Kudowa Zdroj) were also busy piling up bodies, but for a very different purpose. Within the modest looking St. Batholomew’s Church (also called the Kaplica Czaszek) are the skulls and bones of over 3,000 people, decorating the ceiling and walls, and arranged in various patterns — mostly in a repeating crossed bones Jolly Roger-style — with another 21,000 skeletons stuffed in the church crypt below. Collected by Czech priest Vaclav Tomasek and J. Langer, the local grave digger, it took the pair some 18 years, from 1776 to 1794, to collect, clean and arrange the as many as 24,000 human skeletons that pack the church. While the majority of the skeletons are stacked in a 16-foot deep crypt beneath the church, the rest are beautifully displayed in what Tomasek saw as a “sanctuary of silence.” The two had plenty to choose from in terms of raw materials. The Thirty Years War, the Seven Years War, and numerous other skirmishes between Catholic, Hussite and Protestants, Poles, Czech and Germans that bordered the area, left mass graves aplenty, not to mention the cholera epidemics that routinely killed hundreds. Tomasek apparently found the mass graves by watching where local dogs went to dig for bones. As the two uncovered and cleaned the thousands of skeletons, the priest and grave digger set aside skulls of interest for display in the church. Today the skulls are still displayed, and include a Tartar warrior’s skull, the Czermna mayor and his wife, skulls with bullet holes, a skull Swiss-cheesed by syphilis, and even the skull of a giant. Besides these special skulls are those of the priest and the grave digger themselves, presiding proudly over the Chapel of Skulls they created and now call their final resting place. A trapdoor to the crypt below can be opened to reveal the other 21,000 skeletons stacked just below. There is a recording in the church that explains the history of the chapel, but so far it is only available in Polish, Czech, and German. Unfortunately no photos are now allowed inside the Chapel.

1,Crooked Forest,"Gryfino, Poland",Countless stories attempt to explain Poland's mysterious J-shaped trees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gryfino-forest,"Blending science fiction and ecological abnormality, a group of 400 trees in Poland’s Krzywy Las or “the Crooked Forest,” are mysteriously and identically bent. Hovering just inches above the ground, the trees dramatically take a sharp turn toward the sky, rounding into little J shapes as they make their ascent. There is no definitive answer for these pines’ bizarre shape, and the stories about them run the gamut from the practical to the bizarre. The most grounded explanation among those seeking answers is that the trees may have simply been buried beneath a terrible snowstorm in their infancy. Others still believe the gravitational pull in that area has morphed their trunks. The most intriguing explanation suggests that local foresters manipulated the trees after planting them in 1925-1928. Apparently, the foresters hoped to make furniture from the bent shapes and intervened when the trees were only 10 years old. Refusing to let the trees grow upwards, the foresters severely stunted their growth. Likely abandoning their efforts after the start of WWII in 1939, the foresters left a lasting ecological mark 80 years later. Every tree in the Crooked Forest has the same haunting bend, but despite bent beginnings, they have all grown to be tall and seemingly unhampered by their C-shape curves. Trees are resilient, and so they continued to thrive, relying on the one branch they had left to take over complete function and grow upwards. Whatever damage occurred to one tree must have happened to them all because they remain uniform in deformity.  The easiest way to get to the Crooked Forest is by taking a taxi or bus line 1 from Gryfino.",forests trees natural wonders ecosystems plants nature
2,Rynek Underground,"Krakow, Poland",Beneath Kraków Old Town's main square lies a hologram-filled medieval market vampire graveyard wonderland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rynek-underground,"Standing on the cobblestones of Kraków’s historic market square, it would be easy to miss the 4,000-square-meter archaeological site/high-tech multimedia extravaganza a mere four meters below your feet, known as Rynek Underground. The subterranean excavation of the square began in 2005, after the discovery of various artifacts around Kraków’s famous Cloth Hall led to speculation about what else might be found below street level. What was discovered was a treasure trove of items and structural remnants that paint a vivid picture of everyday commercial life in Kraków over the past 700 years, and even beyond. The unique, fully-underground excavation uncovered not only the remnants of merchant stalls and various quotidian objects — such as weights, coins, clothing, and jewelry — but also preserved stretches of medieval thoroughfares, remnants of a settlement that was destroyed by raiding Tatars in 1241, centuries-old aqueducts, and a cemetery showcasing some of the peculiar burial practices of the 11th century. Rynek Underground, opened in 2010, is the museum that was built to showcase this treasure trove of Kraków history, and mixes the artifacts and restored archaeological sites with lasers, smoke machines, holograms, and 600 three-dimensional models of everyday objects manipulated via 37 touchscreens. Visitors to Rynek Underground are first greeted by holographic 14th-century Krakovians projected onto a curtain of smoke, which is parted to reveal an immersive environment representing daily life in medieval Kraków Included in the historical cornucopia are displays depicting burial practices from 1,000 years ago, including the method for burying a suspected vampire. Long-established in Polish folklore, vampires were believed to only become creatures of the night after death. Likely candidates for future vampirism could be identified via their red hair or rows of extra teeth. In order to prevent the undead from rising, “vampires” were buried in a fetal position, with hands tied and heads cut off and placed beneath their feet. This would, it was believed, slow them down quite a bit upon reanimation — and you can see it in practice at Rynek Underground. Given the popularity of the museum and the fact that occupancy is limited to 300 at a time, visitors are advised to buy tickets in advance for a particular entry time. If you have kids, don’t miss the kids’ room, which includes a rousing automated puppet show. If you like lead, don’t miss the 693-kilogram “lead loaf,” which was a highly valuable metal before people figured out that it’s pretty poisonous.",vampires underground hidden graveyards medieval archaeology cemeteries museums and collections museums
3,Wieliczka Salt Mine,"Wieliczka, Poland",An underground city of salt.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wieliczka-salt-mine,"The Wieliczka Salt Mine in Poland is the epitome of technological human progress. The beginnings of the current mine are believed to have been primitively excavated after the discovery of a rock salt deposit in ancient times. In the middle ages, salt became recognized as one of the most important staples in the food and preservation industry, leading to the advancement of salt mining technology and further excavation. During the Renaissance, the mine was one of the largest business ventures in Europe. It was around this time that royal tourists started to flock to the mine, lured there in part by the developing Renaissance taste for humanism and culture. By the late 18th century, Austria gained control of the mine and brought new forms of organization, as well as further technological advancement - many of which are responsible for the longevity of the mine. The birth of general tourism in the mine occurred during Austrian rule. In the early 1990s, the production of salt in the mine ceased, and after the mine flooded, the importance of preservation was reestablished. Despite the mine’s remarkable history, it is the miner artwork (and later artwork by others) that brings over a million tourists to the Wieliczka Salt Mine each year. The miners slowly turned the mine from a dark cave into a majestic royal location. By the 19th century, giant salt-crystal chandeliers lighted the underground complex. Striking salt-carved monuments and reliefs decorated chambers available to tourists, resulting in Europe-wide fame. In the early 1900s, the Kinga Chapel was formed, a chamber filled with large biblical reliefs. Nowadays, tourists from all over the world are guided through the bizarre labyrinthine tunnels of the mine, astonished by the beautifully detailed sculptures, chapels, and even a restaurant as they relive over a thousand years of salty history. In recent years, the mine has been touted for its health benefits. The atmosphere inside is said to be excellent for those suffering from a number of types of respiratory illnesses, and guests can now stay at a special health center/resort there. The Wieliczka Salt Mine is one of the world’s oldest salt mines still in operation.  In 1978, the mine was inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List.",wonders of salt long now locations places to stay outsider architecture eccentric homes subterranean sites homes sacred spaces
4,The Bones of the Wawel Dragon,"Krakow, Poland",Real bones which are said to have belonged to a Polish dragon.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-bones-of-the-wawel-dragon-krakow-poland,"Poland’s Wawel Cathedral holds the remains of a number of Polish royals as well as some of the country’s most famous religious art, but the real attraction at the massive religious compound is the hanging bundle of bones which are rumored to have belonged to a local dragon. Hanging next to the cathedral’s entrance are the “real” bones of the Smok Wawelski—the Wawel dragon. They are chained together in a random jumble, hanging high above the main doors. Before the city was founded, the dragon was said to live in a cave under one of Wawel’s rolling hills. He was of the classic maiden-devouring ilk and the local people even had to put out a fresh young woman each month to quell his appetite. According to legend, he was finally killed by a local hero (or a local apprentice depending on the version), who fed Smok a lamb laced with sulfur. This made the beast so thirsty that he drank water from the river until he exploded. As delightful as it would be if the remains were truly mythological, the bones are actually thought to be fossilized whale bones or mammoth bones. Regardless of their true origin, they have been there for centuries and are credited with magical powers.",dragons churches monuments sacred spaces animals
5,Wawel Dragon's Den,"Krakow, Poland","This Polish cave has housed a dragon, a brothel, and an enduring legend.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wawel-dragons-den,"There are differing legends about how the city of Krakow got its name. Fortunately, every version involves a dragon. According to the stories, a ferocious dragon once lived in the cave that is now part of the Wawel Castle complex. The lizard terrorized the city below for many months, requiring weekly offerings of cattle. Should the townspeople fail to provide the requisite number of animals, the dragon would scorch and devour an equal number of human beings. Here’s where the stories diverge. One says that a cobbler named Krak came up with the idea of stuffing a dead sheep full of sulphur and leaving it out for the dragon as a handy snack. Once eaten, the sulphur ignited in the creature’s belly, forcing it to gulp down gallons of water from the River Vistula until eventually, it exploded. Krak then married a princess, became king, built a castle atop the cave, and named the city in his honor. In another version, the dragon appeared during the reign of King Krakus (sometimes called Gracchus). The beleaguered king asked his two sons, Lech and Krakus II, to rid the city of the fiery scourge. Lech and Krakus came up with the same solution as cobbler Krak, but following the dragon’s explosion, began to quarrel about which of them deserved credit for the dragonslaying. Lech killed Krakus, and told the townspeople that his brother had been killed in battle. When the secret was eventually revealed, Lech was exiled from the country and the city was renamed for the innocent Krakus. The cave itself where the dragon is said to have lived is made up of a series of limestone rooms, that in medieval times served as a tavern and brothel. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction. A fearsome bronze sculpture by artist Bronislaw Chromy was installed at the entrance to the dragon’s den in 1972. Although the sculpture has seven heads, only one breathes fire (thanks to an ingeniously-placed natural gas nozzle).",brothels dragons legends caves ecosystems
6,Auschwitz Concentration Camp,"Oswiecim, Poland",The former Nazi concentration camp stands as a museum to remember this dark chapter in European history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/auschwitz-concentration-camp,"Auschwitz is best known for its horrific story. Many people lost their lives in the concentration camp during World War II. Today it is a museum to remember that dark chapter in European history. The museum is split in two parts. The first is the brick buildings that housed staff, the sick, and various medical experiments. Today you can visit most of the buildings, listen to stories of single people, see their photographs, and the belongings that were stolen from them. A strong stomach is recommended for parts of the museum as it will bring tears to the eyes of even the strongest people. You can go inside solitary cells, one of the smaller gas chamber and crematoriums. The second part of the camp is the one best known from movies. Most barracks have been torn down just after the war but the chimneys remains standing, reminding the visitor how many people were forced to live here until they died from exhaustion or gas. A couple of barracks can still be visited. The crematoriums, where every day 600 people were killed, have been destroyed and can only be observed from a platform. There is also a smallish lake that holds the ashes of countless men, women, and children. Several memorials and signs tell the story of the disturbing place.  There are two parts to the museum, as this was actually two camps. There are car parks available, free shuttles, or you can walk (3km). Admission is free, but it's well worth it to invest in a guided tour. Even though admission is free, there are limited number of tickets available daily and are all pretty much taken by the tour agencies leaving you no choice but to go on a guided tour. Be sure to check ahead if you want to go by yourself and double check what language the tour will be in in case there happens to be free tickets.",holocaust
7,The Neon Museum,"Warsaw, Poland",A program of Communist glamour in post-Stalin Poland is preserved in this colorful museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-neon-museum-warsaw-poland,"After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the Eastern Bloc went through the so-called Khrushchev Thaw that saw a relaxation of social and cultural repression. In Poland, one consequence of this shift was an era of “neonization,” an official policy to bring some of the glitz of Western nightscapes to the streets of Polish cities. The Neon Museum seeks to preserve and display the signs produced under this odd, charming state program. The museum’s collection consists of hundreds of neon signs that were put up throughout Poland from the 1950s to the 1970s. Commissioned and installed by Reklame, the official state advertising agency, the signs were frequently designed to promote cultural and nightlife venues as well as a (theoretically) burgeoning consumer culture. However, since there were no brand names or privately owned shops or businesses, the signs often simply stated what could (again, theoretically) be found at a location (e.g., “Jewelry,” “Sewing Machines,” “Dancing,” “Theater,” etc.) in graceful loops of electric color. The signs were designed by some of Poland’s most prominent artists and graphic designers, and frequently featured totally unique, hand-written fonts. There were many non-typographical, purely decorative signs as well, designed to beautify drab facades and animate the night sky. These neon signs became a defining characteristic of Polish city streets and served as landmarks for the people below. As these signs started to disappear in the post-Cold War era, photographer Ilona Karwinska set out to document this unique industrial art form that left an indelible mark on a particular period of Polish urban life. The resulting exhibition, “Polish Neon,” laid the groundwork for The Neon Museum, which Karwinska opened with her partner David Hill in 2012. It is the largest collection of neon signs in Europe.  Photographers, be aware: only mobile phones are allowed to take pictures inside. No DSLR's or other types of cameras.",neon public works communism museums and collections museums
8,Ruins at Westerplatte,"Gdańsk, Poland",The site of the first battle of World War II.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-at-westerplatte,"On a tiny, cold and wet peninsula, outside the Free City of Danzig, the first shots of World War Two were fired. The first battle of the most devastating conflict in human history began when, on September 1, 1939, at 4:48 am, the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein let loose a barrage of artillery onto the Polish naval depot, Westerplatte. Despite the fact that Westerplatte was tiny and poorly guarded, it was a surprise to few that this would become the site of the first battle of a war long in the making. Within the Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk, today), Nazi support was at an all-time high among the largely German local population, which Hitler’s government had been trying to annex into the Third Reich for years. Westerplatte was the location of the only Polish military presence in the area. For nearly a decade, the Polish military had been warning its allies that a German attack was imminent, but provisions stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles limited the strength of the Westerplatte compound to just 88 soldiers. Against the treaty and in preparation of the ensuing violence, the Polish naval garrison began reinforcing their meager existing fortifications with machine guns, mortars, and antitank weaponry while the number of soldiers stationed there was nearly tripled. It was all for naught, as the Germans won the battle, but against all odds, the outnumbered and outgunned Polish soldiers were able to keep a force more than ten times their number at bay for seven days. In the end, of the 3,400 Germans who took part in the battle, 300 died. Only around 15 of the 210 Polish forces perished. German General, Friedrich-Georg Eberhardt, was so impressed with the valor and heroism of the Polish forces that, following the battle, he allowed Polish Major Henryk Sucharski to carry his saber into captivity and saluted the fallen Polish forces. The heroism of the loss became a rallying cry for Polish underground resistance throughout the war and the battle has been compared by Polish historians to Thermopylae and Verdun. Today, an outdoor museum with a walkable exhibition leads you through the history of the peninsula, as well as the prelude, duration, and aftermath of the battle. Memorials at the site to the fallen Polish soldiers are continuously decorated with flowers and candles. Ruined buildings from the battle have been stabilized and can be walked through. In 1966, the Soviet Government gifted a massive monument to the site called “A Monument to the Defenders of the Coast.” A large sign stands next to the monument reads “Nigdy Więcej Wojny”: War Never Again. There are three primary ways to arrive at the battleground and memorial. By car is the most efficient and parking is free. (It should cost around 25zł by taxi from the city center.) City bus 106 runs everyday, year round and leaves from Gdańsk’s central station. The last option is by ferry on the Żegluga Gdańska boat. The outdoor exhibition is free, open 24/7, and takes between 2-3 hours to explore. Reading material is in Polish, English, and German.",war history world war ii military
9,Książ Castle,"Walbrzych, Poland",A fairytale Gothic castle steeped in Nazi treasure conspiracy theories.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ksiaz-castle,"Shrouded in secrets within the Owl Mountains of southwestern Poland, there sits a magnificent castle where many Nazi conspiracy theories find their roots. Ksiaz Castle is an impressive fortress rising up on a cliff embankment and surrounded by lush forests and immaculate gardens. With a history that dates to the 12th century, the imposing complex has had a wide variety of important owners and architectural acknowledgments that are worth a visit in their own right. Today, however, it is what lies under the castle that draws people’s attention. Ksiaz was confiscated by the Nazis during World War II, and tens of thousands of Nazi prisoners, mainly Jews from Hungary and Poland, were forced to build a massive subterranean complex with 12-meter high ceilings beneath the Gothic and Baroque ramparts that rose above. Most of the network of underground structures lie unfinished directly beneath the castle and in the surrounding area, all part of the mysterious Project Riese (German for “giant”). One of the largest Nazi construction projects during the war, Project Riese continues to baffle historians and scholars due to it’s top-secret status and the few documents that remain detailing it’s purpose. One thing is for certain: Upon completion of Project Riese the castle was to become Adolf Hitler’s personal headquarters. It never did though. The project was never finished and Ksiaz was eventually captured by the Red Army which stole, destroyed, and secreted much of the information relevant to the project. To this day, little but word of mouth rumors and stories can be gleaned from locals who tell of secret atomic weapons or hidden Nazi trains that are laden with valuable art and treasure, said to be booby trapped with extensive weaponry and lying within the soil around the complex. Every year, treasure seekers from around the globe can be found hunting the hills around the castle with metal detectors and dowsing rods, hoping to be the one to find a cache of Nazi gold or any sort of hint to the secrets the castle’s underground complexes may hold. From Wroclaw, the castle is easy to get to by public services. Take a train from Wroclaw to Walbrzych-Miasto station which will take around an hour and thirty minutes and cost 14.60 zloty, and then jump on the number 8 or 12 bus. Alternatively you can drive the 70km from Wroclaw. Taxis from Walbrzych-Miasto are usually around 20-30 zloty.",hitler conspiracy theories treasure gold nazis castles medieval world war ii military
10,The Wolf's Lair,"Ketrzyn, Poland",This Nazi ruin was the site where Hitler was almost blown up by a suitcase bomb.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-wolf-s-lair-ketrzyn-poland,"Hidden deep in a Polish forest, the remains of the Nazi stronghold known as The Wolf’s Lair (Wolfsschanze) are slowly being reclaimed by nature, but the room where Operation Valkyrie nearly blew up Hitler with a suitcase bomb can still be found. Built in 1941, miles removed from the nearest village, The Wolf’s Lair was Germany’s secret headquarters on the Eastern Front. The heavily fortified concrete bunker buildings were protected behind multiple layers of security and the location of the site was a well-kept secret, ensuring that the Nazi leaders could strategize in relative safety. In fact Hitler would spend the better part of the war’s final years at the site. Of course they were largely wary of outside attempts at assasination and therefore felt invulnerable to assasination attempts which might come from within. Thus when a German colonel, looking to put an end to Hitler’s mad rule, concocted a plan to assassinate the Führer, he chose The Wolf’s Lair as the place to do it. Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg was able to sneak a suitcase bomb with a timer device into a meeting room where he knew Hitler would be. Even after the meeting Stauffenberg had planned to set off the bomb in was moved to a different space and a different time, he was still able to detonate the bomb with Hitler in the room while the fascist leader was studying a map of the Eastern Front. Miraculously, and unfortunately Hitler survived the blast with minor injuries due to a member of staff who moved the suitcase slightly further under the table where it had been placed (and who himself lost a leg in the explosion). However The Wolf’s Lair had been compromised. Given the blast and the swiftly approaching Soviet forces, the Nazis abandoned the base by the next year and destroyed most of it with explosives. Despite the destructive tactics of the Nazis, large portions of the heavily fortified base remained intact and have simply sat amongst their Polish forest surrounds for decades. The ruins are now covered in moss and lichen.  You must pay for parking and entrance. Fencing surrounds the site and you will be requested to follow the way of visit.

If it’s in the small Polish village of Zalipie, there are probably some flowers painted on it. Known lovingly as “The Painted Village,” nearly every bare surface in the village, be it stone or wood has been decorated with intricate floral patterns in a tradition that dates back almost a hundred years. While there is little concrete evidence to support the story, the belief is that the habit of painting flowers on the walls began in the days when soot and smoke issued from everyone’s tiny wood-burning stoves. As the black marks from the soot appeared on the interior and exterior walls of the homes in Zalipie, the women would simply cover them with painted flowers. In the beginning they would even make their own brushes out of cow hair and make paint out of cooking fat and dye. By the time of the turn of the century, the old world stoves were replaced with chimneys and cleaner modern ventilation, eliminating the practical need for the tradition, but instead of dying out, the practice just became more elaborate. By this time, the decorative tradition was a part of the Zalipie identity and with the advent of better paints and more varied colors, the rustic floral patterns expanded to intricately weaving vine illustrations accented by vibrant flowers in every color of the rainbow. The paintings also began to spread from the walls of personal homes out onto nearly every blank surface, like graffiti from a street crew of grandmas. The secluded is as vibrant and quaint as ever, although one house which was particularly painted upon has been turned into a museum about the village.",villages eccentric homes homes art

The walls of the unsupervised Northern Barracks building, which is open 24 hours a day, are covered in images and text and installed art. There are plenty of different styles on display in the old tsar’s barracks, including stencils, tagging, and installations. The project is run by the Outdoor Art Foundation, and the works and structure are protected by the Capital Conservator of Monuments. Artworks created by those invited to the project are mixed with text and images added spontaneously by “uninvited” graffiti artists and vandals. The art within the walls of the fort is constantly changing and decaying, just as street art in the wild. Each artist is encouraged to create spontaneously and individually, without any of the restrictions commonly placed on gallery works. The abandoned building, built in the 1880s, isn’t easy to find, making it a favorite among both locals and adventurous travelers. And the art makes for a kind of low-budget revitalization project, helping to preserve and draw visitors to the old fort.",graffiti forts art

When he passed, Chopin’s eldest sister, Ludwika Jędrzejewicz, complied with his request, taking the heart before his body could be buried and secreting it back to Poland in a jar of booze (most likely cognac). Jędrzejewicz hid the hearty package under her cloak, avoiding officers and agents that might ask too many questions about the body part she was carrying. She was able to smuggle it to the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw, where it was buried beneath a small monument. Given Chopin’s popularity in his native Poland, the monument to his heart quickly became a rallying point for proud nationalists. During World War II, the Nazis, knowing the power the composer’s legacy held over the people, stole the heart (as well as outlawing playing his music). However, after the war, they gave it back. The heart was reinterred in the church and remains there to this day, undisturbed until recently. In 2014 a secret Ocean’s 11-like group of church officials, scientists, and medical experts dug up the heart under cover of night. As evocative as the situation sounds, the group was actually just checking the container preserving the heart. They feared it might have cracked, which would have allowed the heart to dry out and decay. Knowing how beloved Chopin still is among the Polish people they simply wanted to avoid causing a public outcry at the exhumation. Though Chopin’s heart is no longer beating, luckily it is still in great condition.",hearts burial places music monuments

The traffic of all ships traveling to and from the port of Gdańsk can be seen and monitored from here, which is why this unique circular fort was a key defensive point for Poland for centuries, starting in the early 14th century. The earliest records of a watchtower in this area date back to 1308, but it wasn’t until over a century later the first permanent fortification building was erected. In 1482, a round tower was built and functioned as a watchtower and lighthouse. Throughout history, the fortress was expanded and remodeled again and again, and a number of additional buildings were arranged around this central tower. In the 16th century, a circular battery consisting of a set of bastions and casemates were added to the structure, to better position the firearms. The foundation of the fort rests on wooden underground bunkers hidden beneath the water, where a collection of historic weapons is now housed. Over the years the importance of this fortress waned, and it was badly damaged by the Soviet Army during the Second World War. Luckily in 1974, the Museum of Gdansk obtained this area and realized the historical importance of the site. The restoration works are still ongoing, but many of the original structures have been restored and can be visited today. Update as of July 2021: The fortress (including the exterior) is currently closed to visitors due to renovation work, which is expected to last until 2024. Bus service to the fortress has also been suspended.  The fortress is easily accessed by car or bus from the city. You can see the exterior free of charge but tickets are needed to climb the tower or tour the casemates. Open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the spring and summer months.

15,Warsaw Gasworks Museum,"Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw's fantastically preserved gasworks...almost.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/warsaw-gasworks-museum,"Beautifully preserved, the Warsaw Gasworks (also known as the “Wola Gas Company”) is one of the most pristine examples of historical industrial architecture from the late 19th and early 20th century. It’s almost a shame, because it would make a fabulous decaying urban adventure to explore. As luck would have it, this place has a little in column A and a little in column B. The majority of the grounds have been beautifully restored, and in what used to be the compressor and pump building resides a huge, diverse museum that includes an in-depth history of Poland’s evolution with gas production. It houses documents and archives of photos, but most impressively, a healthy collection of the machinery used both industrially and in private homes throughout the decades. Gas lamps from every era, some of which still adorn Warsaw’s streets, and assorted home appliances are dwarfed by the massive machinery that once made up the guts of the city’s gas supply. The neoclassical style buildings were built in 1888, but were destroyed during in 1939 during WWII, then immobilized. After the war they were rebuilt, and reopened their doors June 25, 1945. They once again closed in the early 70s, as natural gas became the city’s singular method. It’s been a museum since 1977. While the beautiful buildings and fine museum halls are clean and shiny, there are still parts of the old–delightfully decrepit buildings that have yet to be beautified. Old, enormous gas tanks, and behind the museum–the colosseum. The colosseum is a massive, spherical building that understandably attracts urban explorers and photographers like moths to a flame. Broken windows, crumbling brick, and untamed vegetation abound. Poking around is forbidden, (yes, they do have video cameras) but brave explorers do manage to get over the fence now and then.

16,Liban Quarry,"Krakow, Poland",The unsettling remnants of a torn down movie set lies nearby the ruined location of the actual Płaszów Labor Camp.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/liban-quary,"Although the dilapidated replica of the Nazi’s Płaszów Labor Camp was built for Steven Spielberg’s film Schindler’s List in 1992, the site is eerily realistic and has its own history of Nazi atrocities. The Płaszów set was created using the original blueprints of the camp and erected in a quarry just a few hundred feet from the historic location of the labor camp. Furthermore, inmates of Płaszów camp worked in the limestone quarry and were murdered on the site the replica now stands on. A road made of Jewish tombstones running through the center of the quarry is composed of prop headstones, but the inmates of the real Płaszów Labor Camp would have had to tread to and from work in the quarry over a similar road made of their ancestors’ graves. The site is all but forgotten today, overgrown with vegetation and crumbling, and most Holocaust tourism remains directed on Auschwitz and the Jewish Ghetto. However, anyone up for a short walk from the center of town can experience an abandoned labor camp rusting away in a filthy limestone quarry.  The quarry is southwest of the Kopiec Krakusa, one of many monumental mounds, and Podgurski Nowy cemetery. It is about a 25-minute walk from Krakow's Jewish district. There is a fence surrounding the upper parts of the quarry so that no one falls in, but follow the southeastern wall of the cemetery and there is a walkway down to the site. Keep in mind that you are entering the quarry at your own risk! If you want to access the towers, be careful of the rusty plates and corners! Also test before you step, especially the ladders.

17,Collegium Maius,"Krakow, Poland",Poland's oldest surviving university building holds a wealth of historic science instruments including some used by Copernicus.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/collegium-maius,"Located in part of what is now Jagiellonian University, the Collegium Maius (“Great College” in Latin) has been a hub of scientific research and discovery for hundreds of years, counting among its many famed students Nicholas Copernicus himself, whose instruments are still on display. The college building’s current incarnation was created in the 15th century as part of what was at the time the Krakow Academy. The building was designed around a central courtyard which was eventually fitted with a well. The courtyard level is ringed with arches that led to the various teaching and lecture areas while the second floor was reserved for the professors’ quarters. Inside the building was decorated in an ornate baroque style with intricate woodwork and filigree all around. Subjects covered were heavily focused on science and the secrets of astronomy and the facility was kitted out with all the finest instruments of the day. Among the luminary minds that studied at the college, none stands as tall as Nicholas Copernicus, the man that dared put the sun as the center of the universe as opposed to the Earth. In the early 20th century the space was turned into a museum displaying the college’s historic architecture and, even more intriguing, their impressive collection of 16th century scientific equipment. Throughout the sumptuously outfitted rooms are a number of cases filled with astrolabes, telescopes, globes, clocks, weights, and more, much of which was used by Copernicus himself. Touring the site is about as close as one might hope to get to doing homework with Copernicus himself.",colleges astronomy science architecture
18,Kościuszko Mound,"Krakow, Poland",This man-made mound monument was built out of soil from all across the Polish empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kosciuszko-mound,"The city of Kraków, Poland, is home to four man-made hills or mounds that honor some of the country’s greatest leaders. One of the more recent mounds, the Kościuszko Mound, was specifically created to mimic its more ancient inspirations, but cuts a no less impressive image on the Kraków skyline. Completed in 1823, the Kościuszko Mound is a well-manicured corkscrew of a hill, surrounded by a brick fortification at its base. The mound was created to honor Polish nationalist Tadeusz Kościuszko who was renowned and beloved for his battles against foreign powers in Poland. When Kościuszko died, his body was placed in the royal crypts, but the people demanded a more public monument. Thus in the tradition of the Mound of Krakus and others in the area, they began to build a memorial hill. Funding was provided by Polish residents from all over the country and other outlying Polish settlements, and people came from all over, bringing dirt from their towns and villages to add to the mound. Unlike the older mounds that had been built centuries earlier, which were simply rounded hill forms, this new mound was created with a distinct path winding up to the peak where a commemorative boulder had been placed. Decades after its completion, a brick fort was built around the base while the elevated peak was used as a strategic military position. Over the years, the iconic hill has been damaged by weather and erosion but each time it has been repaired by local citizens and government who see the mound as a powerful symbol of Polish independence.",mounds memento mori memorials monuments architectural oddities architecture
19,St. Mary's Basilica,"Krakow, Poland",St. Mary's features one of the most spectacularly decorated cathedral interiors in all of Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-marys-basilica,"The towering edifice of St. Mary’s Cathedral, at over 260 feet tall, dominates the landscape of Rynek Glowny, the vast open space of Old Town Square in Krakow. Originally built in the early 13th Century, St. Mary’s was rebuilt in brick Gothic style in the 14th century and completed in 1347 during the reign of Casimir III the Great. As impressive as the exterior is, it’s when you step inside that St. Mary’s reveals its greatest glories. Take a couple of minutes for your eyes to adjust to the darker interior and then let them feast on the most splendid, ornately decorated cathedral interior you’ve ever witnessed. Virtually every square inch is painted, carved, frescoed, tiled, draped or otherwise covered in the most fabulous and colorful decorations imaginable. Words truly cannot do it justice. The most famous piece is the main altar, carved from wood by a man named Veit Stoss. The altarpiece is done in a triptych, or three-panel design and is, in fact, the largest Gothic altarpiece in the world at 40 feet wide by 34 feet tall when fully open and extended. It’s covered in richly detailed figures carved from oak and linden wood depicting various Biblical characters and events, most prominently the Assumption of the Madonna, which makes sense for a church named for that event. Side panels depict other scenes from Mary’s life, mostly with Jesus, including the Nativity, Crucifixion, and Resurrection.  One more notable thing about St. Mary's that you don't want to miss is the ""hejnal mariacki."" Every hour on the hour, a trumpeter plays a tune called the hejnal mariacki, a plaintive melody which stops abruptly midstream in commemoration of the bugler who was killed by Mongols as he warned the city of their attack. Standing in the square below and hearing this tune rollout is a special treat that will send chills down your spine. No matter where you are in the square or what you are doing or how noisy it is, the sound of that lone trumpeter playing from the church tower is a sound you won't forget.",poland europe churches sacred spaces

Built in 2007, this tourist trap/political statement is like a mystery house with an anti-communist bend. The upside down house is essentially a fully furnished home like any other, but took much longer than normal to build as workers kept becoming disoriented, forcing them to stop work. It wasn’t even built simply upside down, but on a tilt as well, essentially eliminating the comfort of a reliable, flat surface. Visitors have to climb into the house though one of the attic windows, but once inside, they are able to take a stroll through the house on the ceiling. The interior is decked out in furnishings from the 1970s, when Poland was under Communist rule. There is even an old television that blares vintage propaganda. It’s touches like this where the strange attraction’s true message, designed by the project’s patron Daniel Czapiewski, becomes clear: life in Communist Poland turned the world upside down. Whether you’re interested in the political message or you just want to make yourself dizzy walking through an upside down house, this place has got you covered.

21,Keret House,"Warsaw, Poland","The world’s narrowest house makes for an awkward, four-foot-wide living space.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/keret-house,"Central Warsaw is truly crammed for space, and many downtown developers are turning horizontal space into vertical space by building tall skyscrapers. But in no other setting in the world is a building’s height to width ratio as insanely preposterous as that of Warsaw’s Keret House. Welcome to the skinniest house in the world. Designed by Polish architect Jakub Szczęsny, the Keret House in Warsaw is wedged inside a four-foot crevice, nicknamed a “cushion of air,” between two buildings. The Keret House stretches over 30 feet tall but is simultaneously only 28 inches wide at its narrowest point—thinner than a stovetop—and just four feet wide at its widest. With just 46 square feet of floor space and a world record for narrowness under its name, the Keret House manages to fit a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a two-beverage refrigerator in the span of three floors. The first floor features nothing but a staircase to the second. However, when the staircase is retracted it makes for a pleasant (yet claustrophobic) living room. To get from the second floor to the third, you must climb a white ladder. Since the Keret House is so minuscule, it has no room for traditional electrical and sewage appliances. Szczęsny’s makeshift solution to the electrical dilemma involved obtaining electricity from the two buildings it’s sandwiched in between. To dispose of sewage, the Keret House avoids city standards and instead uses an innovative customized design. Built in 2012, Szczęsny’s narrow masterpiece is legally classified as an “art installation” because it doesn’t meet Polish housing codes, but, in practice, it serves as a residence nonetheless. Constructed as a memorial to his family killed in the Holocaust, the Keret House is named after Etgar Keret, the Israeli filmmaker and author who was spontaneously asked by Szczęsny to be the house’s first tenant. After Keret agreed to the deal and lived there for a number of weeks, the Keret House became open to traveling writers for the night’s stay. As of today, the Keret House is open to all visitors to Warsaw, so long as it’s not undergoing maintenance.",world record houses homes architectural oddities architecture
22,Błędne Skały,"kłodzki, Poland",Naturally formed rock city in Poland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bledne-skaly,"Although they are called the Errant Rocks in English, Błędne Skały looks almost intentional. As perfectly chiseled paths lead visitors on hikes, their imaginations can run wild among the natural forms of the rocks nestled near the Table Mountains of Poland. Set on the border between Poland and the Czech Republic, Błędne Skały has been an important passage for years in Central Europe. During the 17th century, the deep caverns and 35-foot high boulders allowed smugglers to sneak from the Czech Kingdom into the lands that are now modern-day Poland. Evidence of this illicit behavior can still be seen on the smooth sandstone rocks of the area, where a list of dates memorialize the apprehension of smugglers. As fewer criminals passed through the area, Błędne Skały took on a life of its own in the minds of those who visited for recreation. Each rock became an entity to itself, taking on its own personality in the 54-acre preserve. Today, many of these individual weathered formations are known by names such as “Labyrinth,” “Tunnel” and “Hen’s Foot,” and beg visitors to climb and hike near their smoothed surfaces.",subterranean geological oddities geology
23,Warsaw Uprising Monument,"Warsaw, Poland",A tribute to the Polish insurgents who fought in the failed attempt to end their city's Nazi occupation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/warsaw-uprising-monument,"In August of 1944, an uprising broke out in Warsaw, Poland, which had been occupied by Nazi forces for five years. It was meant to be both an act of Polish sovereignty and a way to oppose the German occupiers. Though it was one of Warsaw’s most devastating events, its significance was buried for many years. The Polish Resistance Movement fought an uphill battle against the German forces occupying the city. Around 16,000 resistance fighters and somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 civilians perished. People and information were smuggled into the sewers in an attempt to reach freedom. The uprising was planned to coincide with the Allied forces approaching Poland. However, the Soviet troops that were meant to arrive never did, leaving the Poles to fight alone. The people faced food and water shortages, as they had planned on receiving relief from the Soviets who failed to show. After 63 days of fighting, the German forces finally put an end to it all. They then expelled the population from the city and wrecked and looted its vacant buildings, all while the nearby Red Army did nothing. It’s estimated that 90 percent of the city was destroyed. When World War II ended, Stalin used the failed uprising as Soviet propaganda, twisting the facts to reflect the Polish Home Army’s shortcomings. Stalin had purposely directed his forces not to intervene since he knew allowing the exiled, pro-west Polish government to return would thwart his plants of pursuing a soviet agenda in the country. After communism fell, the Warsaw Uprising was finally given proper recognition. Today, a memorial honors those who fought against Nazi occupation and the threat of a Soviet takeover. The 33-foot-tall bronze sculpture was unveiled in 1989. It depicts a group of fighters in active combat while running beneath the ruins of a falling building. A smaller structure shows insurgents entering a manhole, which pays tribute to the way the Poles made use of the city’s sewer system.

24,Czar PRL: Life Under Communism Museum,"Warsaw, Poland",This hidden collection of everyday objects illustrates life within communist Poland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/czar-pr-llife-under-communism-museum,"This tiny museum, which is better described as a large collection, is spread throughout the top floor of an old office building in the city center. Though the space is small, this characterful exhibition crams a lot in. The museum was founded by Rafał and Marta Patla, who also run tours of Warsaw in vintage “Nysa 522” vans to give an immersive historical backdrop. The space follows the layout of a typical home and is roughly divided into different rooms. In each room, you can admire the kitsch design of many everyday products. Everything from household appliances down to soap and cereal packets has been lovingly displayed, making it look as if the homeowner just stepped out and will return at any moment. Vintage records play in the living room. In the canteen, you can try your hand at children’s board games. You can even purchase a soda in an original 1960s glass bottle and settle down to plan the rest of your trip with some antique guide books to Poland. The whole museum feels like a time capsule of communist Poland. It’s meant to let younger generations get a sense of the lives their elders lived within the People’s Republic of Poland. A lot of the material was donated by members of the public, and the collection continues to grow as more donations arrive.  The museum is open daily. Monday through Friday its hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and its weekend hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Standard admission is 8 zł. All the signs and information are presented in Polish and English. Guided tours require reservations and cost extra. It's a roughly 15-minute walk from the Varshava Vskhodnya train station.

25,Warsaw Poster Museum,"Warsaw, Poland",A national collection of Communist-era musical posters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/warsaw-poster-museum,"During the 1950s and 1960s, communist Poland was a grey and gloomy place. So it makes sense that the Polish people were naturally drawn to the vibrant colors and thematic artistic works (in addition to low cost) of movie, play, and musical posters hung up outside of the government approved cinemas and theaters. The popularity of the medium sparked the annual Warsaw Poster Art Competition, the world famous Biennale, in 1966, and led to the opening of the Poster Museum two years later upon the donation of 13,000 items from the National Museum in Warsaw. At its opening the Poster Museum became the first museum in the world dedicated to the art and presentation of this art medium. The museum is still growing, with over 61,000 posters in its collection; 36,000 representing the history of poster art in Poland, and 500 preserved pieces from World War II. The small space is constantly rotating through its massive collection by way of temporary exhibits with interactive displays and multimedia presentations and is bound to be a different tract from the normal national art museum and quite the contrast to the stuffy Royal Palace just 50 meters away. Several different buses can take one to this place. Get off at the Wilanów Palace stop.

26,The Warsaw Basilisk,"Warsaw, Poland",A menacing statue of this mythical creature can be seen at the legendary site of the monster's lair.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/warsaw-basilisk,"The basilisk is a famous monster from ancient mythology, found in Roman legends, medieval stories, and more recently, in the second Harry Potter book. In Warsaw, there is also a legend about this monstrous creature and its lair. It is said that long ago, the basilisk lived in the basement of a ruined castle in what is now the Old Town Market Square, sleeping during the day and wandering the city at night. Under cover of darkness, the creature killed all that came across its gaze by turning them to stone. It demolished buildings and stole livestock and riches, killing many people and amassing a great fortune for itself over the years. The Warsavians had accepted their fate and lived with this creature among them—that is until a tailor named Jan Ślązak came to town. Though Ślązak only meant to stay in Warsaw for a short time until passing on to the next town, this plan was spoiled when he was arrested and wrongfully accused of murder and sentenced to death. This would have been the end of the tailor were it not for a blacksmith who recently lost his child to the basilisk. The smith suggested that the city ask Ślązak to kill the beast and spare his life if he succeeded. The city council agreed, assuming that the tailor would fail and be dead by morning. Ślązak prepared for the fight by buying a large mirror and sneaking into the basement around dusk, when the basilisk was still sleeping. He then positioned the mirror in front of the beast and made a noise to wake it up. This caused it to jump up, ready to attack the intruder, but when it looked at its own reflection the beast immediately turned to stone, and Ślązak became a hero. These days, there are still traces of the mythical basilisk all around the city, most of them in the form of murals. But one particularly notable depiction can be found outside a restaurant at the legendary site of the creature’s basement lair. The restaurant is named after the basilisk, marked by an imposing statue of the beast resting on the sign outside the door. The basilisk’s eyes are lightbulbs that glow red, giving a very scary glow befitting its menacing past.  The basilisk is located outside Bazyliszek Restaurant in Warsaw's Old Town Market Square (Rynek Starego Miasta Warszawa) and is freely accessible to view at any time. The restaurant itself serves traditional Polish food and is worth a try.

Built in the 1400s by clockmaker Hans Duringer, the elaborate clock is made almost entirely of wood. The clock tracks everything from the time of day, the position of the moon and sun in relation to the signs of the zodiac, and even a calendar of the saints. The work features three distinct tiers with a rotating parade of apostles, death, and the three kings that appear daily at noon at the top. Beneath that feature, there is the intricate zodiac face, which in turn sits on top of the saints calendar. Each of the parts works with one another like, well… clockwork. Standing over 45 feet tall, the huge decoration may be the tallest wooden clock in the world. According to legend, Duringer was deliberately blinded by the authorities after completing the Gdansk Astronomical Clock so that he was unable to produce a clock of equal beauty anywhere else. However, Hans Duringer went on to complete another astronomical clock in a neighboring town, so the legend may not be as accurate as his clocks were.",astronomical clocks clocks churches sacred spaces
28,Nowa Huta,"Krakow, Poland",This sprawling concrete suburb of Kraków was designed by the Soviet Union as the model proletarian city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nowa-huta,"As Soviet occupying forces rolled into Poland toward the end of World War II, they found a country devastated by the ferocious fighting on the Eastern Front. Rebuilding was in order and Moscow, in notably Communist fashion, saw the opportunity not only to remake Poland’s cities, but also to dramatically reshape Polish society while they were at it. To achieve this, the Soviets set to work planning and building Nowa Huta, which was to be an ideal city representing a vision of a glorious Communist future. The project was approved in 1947, and construction of the urban experiment in social engineering began in 1949. One of only two fully-planned Socialist Realist cities ever built (the other being Magnitogorsk, Russia), Nowa Huta was built near Kraków to create a bustling working class enclave that would overshadow the older bourgeois city with its rich history, cultural institutions, and distaste for communism. Built for a population of 100,000, every detail of Nowa Huta was carefully planned and laid out. Wide avenues were designed to halt the spread of building fires; trees lining those avenues were planted to absorb the impact of a nuclear blast. The entire city itself is a “hidden fortress”, with architectural details and aspects of the street grid making the city easy to defend in case of invasion. The whole thing was laid out in a sunburst pattern radiating from a monumental central square (Plac Centralny) and built in a stirring architectural style that combined the Renaissance elegance native to Poland with the grand, overwhelming scale typical of Soviet projects. More important that any of that, though, was Nowa Huta’s intended status as a proletarian paradise. To that end, the city was built with massive steel mill at one end (indeed, the name itself means “New Steel Mill”). The Lenin Steelworks contained the largest blast furnace in Europe and employed 40,000 people at its height, with the capacity to produce 7 million tons of steel annually. It was an odd location for such a facility, given weak local demand for steel as well as the lack of nearby coal and iron ore (which had to come from Silesia and the USSR, respectively), but in this case — as in many others during the Cold War — the symbolism was more important than the logistics. Ironically, Nowa Huta later turned into an anti-communist hub and was key in the Solidarity Movement of the 1980s. Also of note is the Lord’s Ark church, which locals fought for 28 years for permission to build and which also became a powerful symbol of Polish resistance to Communist rule. Nevertheless, Nowa Huta remains to this day one of the best examples of Socialist Realist architecture and city planning.

29,Rapa Pyramid,"Rapa, Poland",A peculiar family mausoleum built by a German nobleman captivated by the occult.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rapa-pyramid,"When you close your eyes and imagine mummies lying within pyramids, ancient Egypt is likely the first thing that comes to mind. But after visiting this strange and obscure pyramid outside the northeastern Polish village of Rapa, you might find good reason to replace that well-worn image with a new, far less familiar one. The Rapa Pyramid was built by Friedrich Heinrich Fahrenheit (also spelled Fahrenheid), an important official and nobleman for Imperial Eastern Prussia who was also an avid art collector and world traveler. Swept up in the contemporary fascination with ancient Egypt, he became obsessed with mummification and pharaonic beliefs of the afterlife. Whether Friedrich actually tried his hand at ancient magic is unclear, but he was certainly intrigued enough to hire Bertel Thorvaldsen (a famous Danish sculptor of the time) to erect a massive family tomb in the shape of a miniature Egyptian pyramid just 5km away from his estate. Completed in 1811, the structure has a perfect square base with sides of 10.4m, a height of 15.9m, and an internal wall angle of 51°52’, which is identical to the Egyptian pyramids at Giza. It wasn’t long before the vault was occupied. Just three years after its completion, Friedrich’s three-year-old daughter, Ninette, passed away and was laid to rest in the mausoleum. Over time, more family members were interred in the unusual crypt, until finally Friedrich himself was entombed in 1849. During the final stages of World War II, the Fahrenheit family fled before advancing Soviet forces. The Red Army blasted open the walls of the mausoleum and opened the graves, cutting off the heads of the mummified corpses, smashing the coffins, and leaving the site to the mercy of elements. Paradoxically, this abandonment probably saved the monument from destruction during the Communist era, and deepened the structure’s magical intrigue. Still in perfect condition when they were desecrated (despite the prevailing swampiness of the area), the decapitated mummies refused to decompose. People came far and wide to visit and photograph the bodies. Mystics attribute the phenomenon to powerful energy fields, created by the intersection at the site of three ley lines and amplified by the tomb’s structure. This dynamic is similarly credited with keeping mosquitos and other bugs out of the marshy area. Over time, the locals rebuilt the monument, but left the headless bodies on display for visitors to see. In 2008, after designating the site as a historic landmark, the Polish government put the Fahrenheit mummies back into closed coffins and sealed the entrance for good. Today, visitors peering through barred windows no longer see headless mummies and Eastern Front destruction, but rather four flower-covered coffins sitting neatly inside.  Getting to this area is not easy and requires your own vehicle. The easiest approach is from the 650. Turn off towards Rapa (signposted). Straight ahead through the woods you'll reach a sign for the pyramid some 8 kilometers from the main road. You can't park right at the approach path to the mausoleum but you get to a car park 200 yards past it – where you get ushered in and charged a small fee - cash only.",occult mausoleums pyramids magic mummies tombs catacombs and crypts

Today, it’s been turned into an underground museum. In 1876, Alfred Nobel & Company changed its name to Dynamitaktiengesellschaft (DAG). Alfred Nobel & Co was founded just eleven years prior by its namesake and successfully developed the stable explosive, dynamite, launching Nobel and his company to eternal fame. Fast forward more than half a century to World War II and the German company’s primary products had switched to explosives and ammunition for the Nazi military. In occupied Poland in 1939, with the aid of Nazi government grants, DAG began construction on a new facility outside of Bydgoszcz with the primary purpose of increasing production and aiding the war effort. Over the next 6 years more than 1,000 buildings, 400km (250 miles) of underground passageways, and 40km of underground railroads were built over a 23 square acre site. Some 30,000 to 40,000 workers, many from local concentration camps and Poles from surrounding villages, were forced to build the massive compound and its dangerous merchandise. The spread layout and underground character of the factory had two purposes: to provide camouflage from spy planes and to provide protection and safeguard other buildings in case of an in-line explosion. Many of the underground tunnels and buildings still remain, and have recently been turned into an eerie, walkable museum. The expansive character of the museum happens along a 2km route and follows dimly lit underground tunnels through various ammunition production facilities where visitors learn about Alfred Nobel, his company, the events leading up to the war and life for Polish residents during German occupation. It continues with exhibits on the forced laborers, weapons used during the war, and a history of major conflicts. One of the final rooms finishes on a somber note as it touches on the future of modern war and the world annihilating weapons that could destroy us all. The museum is not difficult to get to by car or public transportation by bus. Line 68, runs several times a day. It is a 30 minute ride from the first stop, Leśne, then a 10 minute walk down a dirt road. By taxi from the main station, it should cost 35-45zł with normal rates and takes around 20-25 minutes. A bike path also reaches the entrance from the main town. It has varying open days and times dependent upon the season. A self guided tour takes approximately 1-2 hours, though most of the signage is in Polish. Guided tours are also available but must be booked in advance. Typically, there are four a day.

Viewers sat around a large cylinder looking through eyepieces, while stereoscopic slides scrolled past and music played in the background.

It served as a reminder of better times, and of other places where things were different. It was also a meeting place for dissidents and revolutionaries, where jazz music could be heard and pictures of western life could be peeked at. In the words of a Polish Poet Tadeusz Chudy: Today the fotoplastikon is still open, run by the grandson of the original owner, and still a popular meeting place in Warsaw.

34,Carmo Convent Ruins,"Lisbon, Portugal",Legacy of the earthquake that nearly wiped Lisbon off the face of the Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/carmo-convent-ruins,"“Come, ye philosophers, who cry, ‘All’s well,’ and contemplate this ruin of a world.” -Voltaire, 1756 One of the deadliest earthquakes in history struck Lisbon on All-Saint’s Day, November 1, 1755. The city was all but destroyed, and the ancient Carmo convent and church lay in ruins, its library of 5000 books destroyed. Today the ruined arches stand in the middle of the rebuilt city as a reminder of the worst day in Lisbon’s history. The magnitude 9 earthquake struck at about 9:30 am on the Saturday morning, tearing wide gashes in the earth. Because it was All Saints Day, the churches were full and homes were lit with candles. The tremor was followed by a series of devastating tsunamis and five days of raging fires which devoured the buildings left standing. It was one of the deadliest quakes in history, leaving an unknown total number dead (usually named as about 60,000 people though estimates range from 10,000 - 100,000), and 85% of the city in total ruins. The tragedy rocked Europe. Lisbon was a major city and seaport, home to the famous navigators of the great Age of Discovery, and among the oldest continually settled cities on Earth. The earthquake and fires destroyed more than just homes, it took out the royal palace, destroyed the opera house, cathedral, and library. It incinerated most of the maps and journals of the great explorers, and countless works of art. Survivors lived in tent cities in the outskirts of town, traumatized and too terrified to return to the city center, given over to looters and the dead. King Joseph I and his family survived to flee the city as well. The king’s resulting fear of confined spaces stayed with him for the rest of his life, and the royal court remained in an elaborate version of a tent city until his death. The earthquake inspired a frenzy of philosophical and religious soul searching, and some famous battles of wits. Voltaire, horrified by the tragedy and annoyed by religious accusations that Lisbon had been leveled in an act of divine retribution for the lewd lifestyles of its citizens, wrote his “Poem on the Disaster in Lisbon” in 1756. The poem reads, in part: “What crime, what sin, had those young hearts conceived That lie, bleeding and torn, on mother’s breast? Did fallen Lisbon deeper drink of vice Than London, Paris, or sunlit Madrid?” His vitriol was directed particularly towards the (long-dead) philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who subscribed to a theory that God, being all powerful and all knowing, had created the best of all possible worlds and everything that happens in it - earthquakes included - are a part of his master plan. In 1759 Voltaire added to his arguments with his satirical book “Candide” or “Optimism.” The story follows an eternally optimistic young protagonist up against all of the worst the world has to offer including bearing witness to the horrors of the earthquake - inspiring Candide to ask, “If this is the best of all possible worlds, what are the others like?” In Lisbon, life eventually went on. Most of the city was rebuilt, the rubble cleared, and new buildings started. The new Pombaline architecture was named for the practical Prime Minister, the Marquis of Pombal, who immediately turned his energies to rebuilding the city with the famous statement of his plan of action: “Bury the dead and feed the living.” The distinctively modern buildings in the Baixa Pombalina area are considered to be some of the first seismically sound constructions in the world. The Carmo convent which had stood in the center of Lisbon since 1389 was intentionally left roofless as a reminder of the disaster. The property now houses the Museu Arqueológico do Carmo, or Carmo Archaeological Museum, a small archaeological museum dedicated to Portuguese history.  The Carmo Convent is only one minute away from Santa Justa Elevator.",earthquakes disaster areas disasters memento mori collections ruins
35,The Village of Monsanto,"Idanha-a-Nova, Portugal","Houses are tucked between, on, and underneath giant boulders.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/village-of-monsanto-boulders,"In 1938, the village of Monsanto was dubbed the most “Portuguese town in Portugal.” Yet at first glance, Monsanto certainly does not seem representative of the entire country. For one thing, most Portuguese houses are not sandwiched between gigantic boulders. Defined by its landscape, Monsanto hangs off a mountaintop overlooking the Portuguese countryside, with views for miles.The mountaintop has actually been extremely important strategic position since prehistoric times. It’s crowned by the remains of a Templar castle, which was partially destroyed by an explosion, in the 19th century. The village has hardly changed in hundreds of years, and enjoys distinction in Portugal as a living museum. Due to this standing, Monsanto cannot be changed and has retained its classic village charm. Its tiny streets wind at a steep grade past red-roofed cottages tucked against mossy boulders. Some of the boulders are actually fitted with doors, leading to structures carved right into the rocky landscape. While the mountainous town seems a bit unorthodox, it is actually a unique twist on classic Portuguese architecture. Walking along the cobbled streets it soon becomes evident that Monsanto is a microcosm of Portugal. The architecture even incorporates the Portuguese Manueline style on a number of buildings and a church. While it certainly represents the classic Portuguese village style, visitors will no doubt be more impressed with the cottages built in boulder chic than medieval Romanesque or Manueline.

36,Portugal's Chapel of Bones,"Évora, Portugal","A 16th century chapel decorated with bones, skulls, and entire bodies hanging from the wall.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/portugals-chapel-bones,"The Chapel of Bones in Évora, Portugal, is part of the larger Royal Church of St. Francis, and was constructed by Franciscan monks in the late 16th century. The Chapel’s story is a familiar one. By the 16th century, there were as many as 43 cemeteries in and around Évora that were taking up valuable land. Not wanting to condemn the souls of the people buried there, the monks decided to build the Chapel and relocate the bones. However, rather than interring the bones behind closed doors, the monks, who were concerned about society’s values at the time, thought it best to put them on display. They thought this would provide Évora, a town noted for its wealth in the early 1600s, with a helpful place to meditate on the transience of material things in the undeniable presence of death. This is made clear by the thought-provoking message above the chapel door: “Nós ossos que aqui estamos, pelos vossos esperamos,” or: “We bones, are here, waiting for yours.” The design of the Chapel of Bones in Evora is based on the ossuary of San Bernadino alla Ossa in Milan, Italy. The immediate view as you enter the Chapel gives you some idea of its scale and the sheer number of bodies that are interred here — some 5,000 corpses. Among them, in a small white coffin by the altar, are the bones of the three Franciscan monks who founded the church in the 13th century. Also included are two desiccated corpses hanging by chains from the wall next to a cross. One is that of a child. The purpose of the Chapel is made clear by a poem (translated below by Rev. Carlos A. Martins), written by Father Antonio da Ascencao, that hangs from one pillars: “Where are you going in such a hurry traveler? Pause… do not advance your travel; You have no greater concern Than this one: that on which you focus your sight. Recall how many have passed from this world, Reflect on your similar end, There is good reason to reflect If only all did the same. Ponder, you so influenced by fate, Among all the many concerns of the world, So little do you reflect on death; If by chance you glance at this place, Stop… for the sake of your journey, The more you pause, the further on your journey you will be.” Just in case all that death should cause you to despair, at the end of the Chapel, above the altar, you can read the Latin phrases: “I die in the light” and “The day that I die is better than the day that I was born.”",ossuaries catacombs bones memento mori catacombs and crypts death

But for 285 years, the Livraria Bertrand, as it is known today, has served Lisbon’s bibliophiles and been a space for intellectual and cultural conversations. Opened in 1732, it holds the Guinness record as the world’s oldest bookstore still in operation. The bookstore was opened by Peter Faure as a small shop in the central Rua Direito do Loreto. It was a favorite haunt of Portuguese writers and intellectuals across different generations. Alexandre Herculano, the 19th-century historian who is widely credited with ushering in Romanticism in Portugal, historian-turned-minister Oliveira Martins, and the prolific novelist Aquilino Ribeiro, are among the Portuguese thinkers who sought out like-minded people at the bookstore. Ribeiro, a Nobel Prize nominee, even had some of his books published by the printing press that was later started by the shop, and the current store has a dedicated “corner of Aquilino.” In 2010, the Livraria Bertrand became part of the Porto Editora group, with branches all over the country.

38,Pena National Palace,"Sintra, Portugal",This unreal Portuguese palace looks as though it's made from a pile of different castles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pena-national-palace,"Perched high atop a lush hill in São Pedro de Penaferrim, Portugal, the Pena National Palace is a popular national landmark that looks as though it was created by mashing up towers, facades, and architectural flourishes from a bunch of different castles. Built in the 19th century by King Ferdinand II, the palace was meant to be a summer home for the Portuguese royals. Ferdinand’s opulent tastes were imposed on the builders and designers, creating a schizophrenic manse that, at least from the outside, seemed to indulge any and all of the king’s passing tastes. One portion would resemble a medieval European castle complete with ornate parapets, then the portion directly next to it would be modeled after an Islamic tower dome. Each section of the facade was also presented in a different color; a long purple wing is flanked by a red clock tower, and a yellow minaret and so on. It is said that Ferdinand wanted the palace to look like an opera. It is now seen as one of the grandest examples of Romantic architecture. The interior of the palace was no less opulent or eclectic. Many of the rooms were designed to reflect a certain cultural influence ranging from Middle Eastern styles to the European Baroque. When the royal family fled Portugal during the Revolution of 1910, the palace and its grounds were abandoned and fell into disrepair. However the site was restored later in the 20th century, and is now classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The palace can now be visited by any peasant willing to make the trek, and it is well worth it since visitors essentially get to experience a whole world of architecture in one stop.   Unfortunately, visitors are not allowed to take pictures of the interior.",eccentric homes castles homes architectural oddities architecture

40,Capela de Ossos Bone Chapel,"Faro, Portugal",This small chapel is built of human bones and decorated with a golden skeleton.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/capela-de-ossos-bone-chapel,"With its big windows and light-filled sanctuary, the ossuary in Faro may be one of the cheeriest buildings made of human bones you’ll encounter. The inscription over the door reads: “Stop here and think of the fate that will befall you – 1816,” a helpful reminder put in place by the Carmelite monks who built the chapel that year on the grounds of the larger church dating to 1719. It is not merely decorated with bones — the walls are constructed from femurs with mortar. Skulls and other bones are placed on the interior at regular intervals, including grinning down from the barrel-vaulted ceiling, giving the place a pleasing, yet spooky, symmetry. The highlight of the ossuary is a complete skeleton covered in gold that hangs at the front of the chapel. The practice of moving bones from cemetery plots into ossuaries after a period of time in the ground (usually seven to ten years) was common throughout Catholic Europe until recently. The bones in this ossuary are the remains of 1,245 monks whose bones were displaced when the ossuary was built. There are several other bone chapels in Portugal, the most famous being in Evora.  Go to the rear of the Igreja do Carmo church to find the Capela dos Ossos. Make sure to avoid siesta time (between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon) as it closes. As of a visit in March of 2018 there is no golden skeleton in sight, but the chapel still quite a thing to behold. Entrance ticket is two euros.",ossuaries catacombs and crypts

In this way, Lisbon keeps its secrets safe. One of the hidden gems it holds is a candle shop that has been open since 1789. Given its age, it’s no wonder Caza das Vellas Loreto is among the oldest operating candle shops in the world. The store’s been selling its waxy goods since July 14, 1789—coincidentally, the same day the French Revolution ignited. Caza das Vellas Loreto has remained in the same family for seven generations. You can feel the history in the quiet simplicity of the old wood-paneled display cases and the clock above the door that leads back into the storerooms. Visiting the store makes you wonder what life looked like in Lisbon not long after the devastating earthquake of 1755 destroyed most of the city. It’s easy to imagine this little shop helped light the way forward.  If you go, don't be surprised if you have to wait in line for a bit.

Surviving the 120-day sea voyage to Portugal, the rhino was a diplomatic gift from India. Arriving in 1515, the Indian rhinoceros was off-loaded near the construction site of the Tower of Belem in Lisbon. For a few months it was kept shackled and on display at king Manuel I’s Ribeira Palace, where it was used for less-than-sophisticated hijinks: The Portuguese attempted to make the rhino fight an elephant (the elephant wasn’t up for it, and walked off). Before long, Manuel grew tired of the rhino and decided to have it shipped off to Pope Leo X, whom he was buttering up for political favors. The year before, Manuel had sent Leo a hugely popular gift of a rare white elephant, which the pope kept as a pet and named Hanno. (Hanno died two years later of constipation—or rather of hair-brained “cures” for elephant constipation.) Tragically, the rhino never made it to Rome, drowning instead in a shipwreck off the coast of Northern Italy. Strangely, the short-lived rhino inspired a famous woodcut by the artist Albrecht Dürer, who never saw the animal in person. He based his illustration on secondhand descriptions and a sketch by an unknown artist. The resulting woodcut shows a magnificent beast in riveted armor. Real rhinos being in somewhat short order at the time, this fanciful interpretation of reality became known as “Dürer’s Rhinoceros” and went on to inspire dozens of paintings and sculptures across Europe. Meanwhile, the beautiful Tower of Belem was being built as the third in a series of fortifications designed to protect the natural port of Lisbon. Constructed between 1514 and 1520 of local lioz limestone, the tower is an example of the distinctive Portuguese “Manueline” style, named for King Manuel I. The style incorporates motifs inspired by the great Age of Discovery and the recent return of Vasco de Gama from explorations to the Far East. Design elements from Morocco, Venice, and India mingle with nautical symbols like rope. The entrance to the tower is marked with carvings of armillary spheres representing Manuel’s support of exploration. The turrets are decorated with carvings of exotic beasts. At the base of one of the turrets, stone carvers immortalized the rhinoceros they saw in 1515, now well worn, but notably lacking the armor of Dürer’s interpretation. The 100-foot tall tower survived the disastrous earthquake of 1755, and has been restored many times. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

43,Igreja de São Francisco,"Porto, Portugal",The stunning interior of this Gothic church is covered in ornate gold details.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/igreja-de-sao-francisco,"The Igreja de São Francisco (Church of Saint Francis) in Porto, Portugal boasts fabulous Baroque features. It was founded by the Franciscan friars as part of their convent, one of the oldest in Portugal, and dates back to the 13th century. Its interior is decorated with intricate carved panels, all covered with a layer of gold leaf. It’s a breathtaking work of art that took several decades to complete. The magnificent building hasn’t always rocked these extravagant gold accessories. It received its precious metal makeover in the 1700s between centuries of turbulence. During the Napoleonic invasions of the early 19th century, the friars fled and the convent was occupied by the invading troops. They plundered the church, taking with them some panels, and to add even further insult, used the church as a stable. Decades later, during the Portuguese Civil War, the city of Porto suffered a severe siege. The convent, occupied by the garrison that defended the city, was bombarded and suffered a serious fire. But the church was saved. It was used as warehouse near the seaport until the beginning of the 20th century. Today, the church houses a museum and still contains its prized features, including its sculpture of Jesus’ family tree. Known as the “Gold Church,” it has been completely restored. The exuberance of its decor is so great that it has been impressing visitors and foreigners for centuries (though people should take a break from admiring the dazzling decorations to check out the catacombs). The church is located in the historic center of Porto and several buses stop in front of the door in Infante Dom Henrique Square. It's also possible to go by tram since the end of Line 1 finishes straight ahead. The walking tour, however, is the most recommended. The church is close to other touristic sights, five minutes from Ribeira and 15 minutes from Aliados Avenue and Porto-São Bento Railway Station.

Though it looks like a natural sinkhole lined with cascading waterfalls, Covão dos Conchos is, in fact, a wonder of engineering. This lake in the Serra da Estrela mountains was artificially created in 1955 during the construction of the nearby hydroelectric dam. Instead of building a pipeline to channel water between Lagoa Serra da Estrela and Lagoa Comprida, the engineers working on the project decided to drill a tunnel through the mountain to connect the two lakes. The spillway is designed to provide nearby communities with fresh water, but the fact that no other constructions are present nearby makes the funnel seem more like a part of the lake than a part of an infrastructure project. What’s more, there are plants growing around the edges of the concrete and granite drain pipe, making the giant hole look even more natural. This sci-fi-looking spillway was a little-known secret in Portugal until photos of the hole went viral in 2016.  Covão dos Conchos is located in the Serra da Estrela natural park and is far from any big city. The hike leading to the spillway starts at Lake Comprida and is around 6 miles (10 km) long. A detailed description of the hike can be found here.

45,Santa Justa Lift,"Lisbon, Portugal","This Industrial Age architectural and engineering gem helps visitors and residents alike traverse Lisbon, “The City of Seven Hills.”",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santa-justa-lift,"Hills: they’re great to look at and to look from, but climbing them can be a drag. For a city like Lisbon — which has, according to its well-worn nickname, no fewer than seven hills comprising its setting — this has long been a consideration when designing intracity transportation systems. The Santa Justa Lift is a gorgeous fin de siècle solution to this problem that is still in use to this day. In the heart of Lisbon, the lower Baixa Pombalina district is separated from the higher Bairro Alto by a sudden elevation change of 45 meters (147 feet). As early as the 1870s, a lift system was proposed to facilitate the climb. First consisting of an animal-powered inclined rail lift, work began in 1900 to replace that with a vertical elevator. Inaugurated by King Carlos in 1901 and fully operational in 1902, the Santa Justa Lift has been shuttling people up and down ever since. The elegant Neo-Gothic iron tower was designed by Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, an engineer from Porto who was a student of Gustave Eiffel. Originally powered by a steam engine, the elevator motor was converted to cleaner electric operation in 1907. Lisbon still has some older funiculars (i.e., inclined tramways) still in operation, but Santa Justa is the only remaining vertical urban lift. Today, the Santa Justa Lift operates almost 16 hours a day, seven days a week, with one of its two steampunky wood-and-brass cars departing every few minutes. A platform above the upper terminus can be reached by a spiral staircase, where one can find a cafe offering commanding views of Rossio Square, the Baixa, and some of the cool stuff (like a castle!) on Lisbon’s other six hills.  The queue for the elevator can be insanely long, but the platform can easily be reached by walking around and up the hill at the back (this also takes you past the Carmo convent ruins). The lift can then be taken down with hardly any queue.",elevators engineering

It is unclear if the staircases are original, but they have been constructed to complement the style of the interiors. Outside is the massive eagle which was the symbol of the old Imperial.

In 1967, construction began on a dam that would flood areas of the River Homem, and provide massive hydroelectricity to the region. Amid some protest, the Portuguese Electricity Company paid off residents to leave their homes, as the dam would completely submerge the small village of 300 people. In 1971, the last resident left the town, and its barren structures awaited the deluge that would bury it beneath the river. In 1972, the town was submerged, plunging over 2000 years of history in the village into water. According to oral accounts, the town was founded by Romans in the 1st century C.E., and was prosperous throughout its history. Today, the barren walls, windows and doors rise mysteriously when the dam water levels fall. A museum dedicated to the lost city was built in nearby São João do Campo, and other commemoration efforts have taken place since the town was flooded 40 years ago. Recently, boats with transparent bottoms have also taken tourists near the village so the remains of the city can be seen and the history not lost forever. It is possible to find locals to take you on the lake in a boat, but no one goes near the end with the ruins. Since water levels fluctuate, it can be very dangerous for boats. Unless you dive on your own or arrive during a drought, you will probably not see the ruins. The area has beautiful hiking and walking paths.",underwater week ghost towns ruins
48,Estufa Fria,"Lisbon, Portugal",This once-forgotten oasis in the middle of Lisbon was first created over a century ago quite by accident.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/estufa-fria-cold-greenhouse,"At the start of the 20th century, what is now a lush botanical garden home to over 300 plant species and dotted with beautiful lakes and waterfalls was, instead, a barren place. Lisbon was much smaller then, and the site was far from what is now the center of the city. It was a bleak zone, home to an abandoned basalt quarry. When the quarry was forced to shut down (because a waterway was found at the site that made it difficult to extract the rock), the empty cavern was used by a local gardener to shelter his collection of plant species from all over the world. His intention was to transplant them on Avenida da Liberdade, which was at the time the new and main artery of the city. But the onset of the First World War disrupted these plans, and the former quarry site was abandoned once again. Then something wonderful and unexpected happened. The fact was, the old quarry was an ideal environment for these plants to flourish, and the site grew into a magnificent garden in a short time. That changed the mind of the authorities of the Lisbon Council, and the Estufa Fría, meaning “Cold Greenhouse” was finally inaugurated in 1933. Since then, the space has been refurbished several times. In the 1940s a lake and a large assembly hall were added and in 1975 the Estufa Quente (Hot Greenhouse) and Estufa Doce (Sweet Greenhouse) were added to exhibit tropical plants and cactus and succulent plants, respectively. The Cold Greenhouse is so-named because it does not use heat-generating mechanisms to control the temperature of the room, but rather a natural system. A fixed wooden framework protects the greenhouse from the cold temperatures of winter and sifts the light to shade the space from excessive heat in summer. It provides a suitable temperature to cultivate plant species from regions as diverse as China, Australia, Peru, Mexico, Brazil, Antilles, and Korea. Among the most interesting specimens are the arborescent ferns from Tasmania (Dicksonia antarctica), the azaleas (Rhododendron spp.) and the camellias (Camellia japonica). An added attraction is a walkway along the original bedrock, which offers a view of the old quarry.  The Estufa Fría is located within Eduardo VII Park in the city center of Lisbon. The nearest metro stations are the Marqués de Pombal and Parque stations.

49,Jerónimos Monastery,"Lisbon, Portugal",Elaborately carved to showcase the glorious wealth that the age of exploration brought to the Portuguese empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jeronimos-monastery,"Though it’s one of the most important buildings in Portugal today, the Jerónimos Monastery had much more humble beginnings. In the 14th century, the small Lisbon chapel, Santa Maria de Belém, was presided over by monks of the military-religious Order of Christ. Originally built by Prince Henry the Navigator, the duty of the monks there was to assist Portuguese sailors and ships leaving port for long journeys. Seamen and crew would spend their last night in Portugal within the church, often praying for safe travel and confessing their sins to the monks there in case they did not return to land. Of the most famous was the great Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama, who was the first European to reach the Far East by sea and who credited the night of prayer in the church with his success. Upon the triumphant return of de Gama and the new found riches, King Manuel I began construction of a new monastery on the location, one to showcase the glorious wealth that the age of exploration brought to the Portuguese empire. The monastery and church were built over the next 100 years with taxes from imported goods from Africa and the far east. Unsurprisingly, several architects and numerous sculptors worked on the building, together achieving a level of cohesive realization in creating one of the most majestic examples of Late Gothic Manueline style of architecture. The King donated the construction to the monks of the Hieronymite order, who were tasked with praying for the soul of the King and his family— likely no small task when considering the atrocities of Portuguese explorers and traders among plundered lands all in the name and with approval of their King. Regardless, for the next several hundred years the monks continued in their duties until the order was dissolved and the monastery abandoned in 1833. For a time it was a children’s school, but it gradually fell from its grandeur into disrepair thanks to earthquakes and neglect. It has seen several restoration projects and cleanings since the mid-1800s, where it once again became the pride of the capital city. In 2007, the Treaty of Lisbon was signed at Jerónimos. Today, the monastery is a UNESCO world heritage site. Inside are the tombs of the royal family, Vasco de Gama, and Luís de Camões among other notable Portuguese notables from the age of its construction. There are several ways to use public transportation to get to the site: Buses 714, 727, 729 and 751 stop at Belém. Tram 15 has a stop right outside the monastery. Additionally, Lisbon-Oeiras suburban train service from Cais do Sodré stops at Belém. Metered parking is available in the area around the neighborhood.Admission to the church is free; it's a church! You will see great long lines waiting to pay for admission: to the cloister. Of course you want to see both. Here's the secret: to the far-ish left of the main entrance is the National Museum of Archaeology. Go in there, and pay for admission to both the museum and the cloister. Visit the Gold Treasure room in the museum. You will be astounded! Then, from the far end of the museum, show your ticket and be at the head of the line for admission to the cloister. After that, exit the cloister and you will be at the free entrance to the church. The three are worth a day. After the museum and monastery, walk to the left along the Praca Imperio and Rua Belem to the cafe Pasteis de Belem. (Marked on Google maps.) Go inside to a table and have a plate of custard tarts; spinkle them with cinnamon and powdered sugar; with a coffee. Then have a nap before supper!",monks churches sacred spaces architecture
50,Castelo dos Mouros (Castle of the Moors),"Sintra, Portugal",An ancient and majestic fortress that played an integral role in Portugal's road to independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castelo-dos-mouros-castle-of-the-moors,"In 1147, the Moorish forces in southwestern Iberia surrendered a key piece of defensive real estate to the Christian forces led by Afonso Henriques: Castelo dos Mouros, or Castle of the Moors. Long considered siege-proof and undefeatable, the peaceful conquest of the defensive outpost by Henriques was one of the main turning points in the European’s efforts to remove the ruling North African Moors from the continent, and set Portugal on the road to its own independent history throughout the next near millennia. Built some 300 years prior, the Castle of the Moors stood on one of the highest points in the area, safeguarding the important trade town of Sintra, and the largely agricultural region around it, from attack. After its capture by Portuguese forces, the fort remained a seat of power in the region for several hundred years before being partially abandoned and reinhabited by the local Jewish population. They were eventually forced out of the structure and it was completely abandoned by the early 16th century where it gradually fell into disrepair and decay through fire, earthquake, and general neglect. In 1840, King Ferdinand II began repairs on the ancient fortress, as to add to the expanding palatial gardens of nearby Pena Palace. Walls and towers were restored and the surrounding hills were planted with trees, vines, and shrubs while paths and gardens were additionally incorporated into the renaissance styled romantic landscape that the King envisioned. Further restoration work continued into the mid-20th century and archeological digs began excavating ruins from the time of the mountain’s original owners, from 5,000 BC to today. Today, the fortress is once again majestic in its stately splendor, impossible to miss from every angle in the magical and venerable town of Sintra. It is open nearly every day of the year for a small fee to visitors willing to explore the stabilized ruins and take in the jaw-dropping (and stomach-dropping) views of the region below. Cobblestone paths through enchanting mountain mist lined with moss covered boulders guide the way as plaques and guide posts inform tourists of the excavation work, original purposes of the remaining buildings, and insight into life within the castle walls. Getting to the castle is easiest by the Sintra tourist bus 434, which begins running at 9:15am. A round trip ticket is €5.00. Personal drivers will also drive visitors up the mountain for a similar price.Walking to the fortress is a steep, but well-worth-it climb from Sintra through lush mossy forest and gardens that surround the structure. Entrance to the castle is open between 9:30-20:00 (summer season) or 10:00–18:00 (winter season). The last admission is 1 hour before the closing time and a typical visit lasts between 1 to 1.5 hours. The fee is €8.00/€6.50/€6.50 (Adult/Child/Senior).",fortresses castles religion sacred spaces history
51,Boca do Inferno,"Cascais, Portugal",A unique seaside cave where Aleister Crowley faked his own death.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boca-do-inferno,"Boca do Inferno (in English: “Mouth of Hell”) is a scenic cliff formation located west of Cascais, Portugal. It gets its name from the rough ocean waves which crash against the cliff face, forcing their way into a cave system, and spraying angrily from an opening above. The cave has been a tourist attraction for centuries. One of the first “actuality films”, A Sea Cave Near Lisbon (1896), was shot from inside the cave to showcase the majestic waves pouring in. Boca do Inferno is better known as the place where Aleister Crowley, the famed astrologer, magician, and occultist faked his death in 1930. With the help of poet Fernando Pessoa, he was able to give the appearance of a suicide (perhaps inspired by the death of the Greek philosopher Empedocles, who threw himself into a volcano). Pessoa handed Crowley’s suicide note to newspapers, helpfully explaining the Thelemic symbols and translating mangled Portuguese to police and media alike. Crowley reappeared three weeks later at the opening of an exhibition of his works in a Berlin gallery, suggesting this whole affair was more publicity stunt than anything else. The content of the note also indicates it was intended to annoy his lover and magical partner. Today, there is a small white plaque mounted on the rock commemorating the event. It tells the story of the pseudocide and provides the text of Crowley’s suicide note: “Não Posso Viver Sem Ti. A outra ‘Boca De Infierno’ apanhar-me-á não será tão quente como a tua” which translates roughly to “Can’t live without you. The other mouth of hell that will catch me won’t be as hot as yours.” That might be touching if any of it were genuine.",aleister crowley magic geological oddities caves natural wonders ecosystems water geology nature

Scattered in huge and unlikely scenes amongst the trees, bushes and live peacocks are oversized snakes, lizards, toads, bees, shellfish, mushrooms, cats – all made of china. While much of the artwork is obscure, one piece is well-known – the gold medal that Bordallo Pinheiro won in the Paris International Exhibition of 1889. Directly across the Campo Grande from the City Museum is the Rafael Bordallo Pinhiero Museum dedicated to the artist himself. The fountain with the crabs is no longer decorated with anything.

53,Convent of the Capuchos,"Colares, Portugal",The verdant mossy ruins of a Franciscan monastery lie in the remote Sintra hills awaiting exploration.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/convent-of-the-capuchos,"In the forested mountains surrounding Sintra a simple and isolated convent originally built to be close to nature grows continually closer. Now overgrown with vibrantly lush vegetation, this abandoned 16th-century monastery is serene and isolated, both enchantingly haunting and reminiscent of fantasy stories. Inspiring to the imagination, this magical ruin is today just as much an escape from the busy and opulent resort town of Sintra as it was when it was built in 1560. The monastery was founded by a group of reclusive Franciscan friars who lived an extremely simple and rudimentary lifestyle in this remote corner of the Sintra hills. The monks took their vow of austerity to the extreme here, living in rock-hewn structures designed to blend completely with the idyllic natural landscape. They slept on stone beds in tiny cell-like quarters cut out of giant granite boulders. As a sole comfort, the monks lined the walls and roofs with cork—found in abundance in the surrounding woods—for protection against the cold and wet. This is why the complex, while officially named the Convent of the Friars Minor Capuchin, is commonly known as the Convent of the Capuchos, or “Cork Convent.” The humble monastery remained active until the 1830s when the religious orders were abolished in Portugal and the complex was abandoned. Today it blends more than ever with nature, but has been restored and is open daily to explorers who make their way into the wilderness of the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park.  Getting there can be a little challenging, which does help filter out the crowds. The monastery is just over 7 km from Sintra-Vila, and about 5 km from the Parque da Pena split. The road is both remote and winding, if you don't mind the walk. Follow the step-by-step directions on the website, signage, or GPS coordinates. Busses to the convent are very rare, if ever. Taxis also work, but can charge up to 30 or 40 euro for one way. Adult tickets are 7 euro. Audio guides are available for another 3 euro and well worth it.",monks landscapes monasteries national parks religion abandoned nature sacred spaces ruins history
54,Benagil Caves,"Lagoa, Portugal",Perhaps the most spectacular grotto along the Algarve coastline.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/benagil-caves,"Opt for the morning tour to see the grottoes at their best, with the perfect incidence of light. Out of the dozens of grottoes that populate Portugal’s southern coastline, there’s one that stands out, the Benagil Caves. Just like any other sea cave in the Algarve region, this one was shaped by the pounding Atlantic waves. Yet, unlike other grottoes, the Benagil cave bathes in light thanks to a natural skylight. Erosion has not only hit the cave at the base of the cliff, but erosion has also taken place at the top where rainfall has caused the softer segments of limestone to erode and collapse. This beautifully shaped skylight, often referred to as “the eye”, allows the sunlight to flood inside. Even though “the eye” has been fenced, visitors can still catch a glimpse of the inside of the cave from atop the cliff. There’s a second feature that sets the Benagil cave apart from other grottoes in the area and that’s the wide, sandy beach found inside. What makes this beach so intriguing, is the fact that you can only reach it from the water. Visitors will find many tour operators offering such excursions at the nearby beaches. The easiest way to visit the Benagil cave is by boat. In high season, visitors will see dozens of boat tours entering and exiting this wonderful grotto on a daily basis. Because of the heavy traffic, passengers are only allowed to pass through the cave and take in its beauty from the boat. The only visitors allowed to actually access the beach are kayakers and stand-up-paddle-boarders. Note that these tours are not organized during the winter season. Swimming is not recommended because of high boat traffic and strong waves. Falling rocks from crumbling cliffs pose yet another risk for swimmers. The best incidence of light occurs in the morning. That’s also the best time of day to visit in order to avoid rush hour inside the cave. This popular grotto has transformed the quiet fishing village of Benagil into a tourist hotspot. The natural surroundings of the region are not designed to handle the streams of tourists, so expect narrow roads and limited parking.",natural history caves natural wonders ecosystems nature
55,Capela do Senhor da Pedra,"Arcozelo, Portugal",Picturesque intersection of witchcraft and ancient Christianity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/capela-do-senhora-da-pedra,"Originally, the stunning marble- and granite-strewn beaches of Miramar were the site of ancient pagan worship. Specifically, the giant boulder jutting into the sea was where rituals were once performed and where the Capela do Senhor da Pedra (Chapel of the Lord of Stone) sits to this day. As part of the mass campaign to Christianize Europe during the 17th century, the hexagonal structure was constructed to ‘reclaim’ the land from the ‘heretic,’ naturalist pagans who sought enlightenment at the very same site. Visitors can scale the set of stairs leading from the sands to the altar, or take the more penitent route by scrambling up the steep boulder sides. The doors to the sanctuary are framed by two azulejo mosaics boasting of the site’s architectural import, as well as noting that Pagans had worshiped here before the chapel became ‘certainly the oldest place of worship in the region.’ Inside, three ornate altars decorated in gold leaf were erected, depicting Christ hanging from the cross. Today, the crucifix is back-lit by a (questionably-chosen) green bulb. To the chapel’s rear, a horseshoe shaped indent appears in the rock. Explanations of its origin are odd and vague, ranging from belonging to the Virgin Mary’s donkey, to having roots in D. Sebastian’s horse who was navigated poorly on a foggy day, etc. Perhaps most interestingly, starting on Trinity Sunday, an annual three-day festival commemorating the site’s Pagan past takes place in Miramar. The festivities culminate on the following Tuesday with a procession led by fully cloaked women (“witches whose identities remain unknown” according to one local) from the city center to the chapel. The chapel is worth visiting as much for its unique situation and gorgeous vistas, as its embodiment of a culture clash whose traces remain traceable to this day.  By train, travel south from Porto/Vila Nova da Gaia. Exit at the Miramar station and walk towards the sea, where it will be easily visible.",lost tribes islands
56,Preserved Head of Diogo Alves,"Lisbon, Portugal",An early Portuguese serial killer's head is alarmingly well preserved in a jar at the University of Lisbon.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/preserved-head-of-diogo-alves,"The first thing you’ll notice upon entering the anatomical theatre at the University of Lisbon’s Faculty of Medicine is the lone pickled head, up on a shelf next to a diaphonized hand. It’s yellow, peaceful-looking, and somewhat akin to a potato. The various physicians and anatomy technicians in the preceding hallway all address it with a mix of familiarity and indifference. It’s just there, really. Just the head of Diogo Alves, whose claims to fame include being both Portugal’s first serial killer and the last man to be hanged. At least one half of each claim is true. Diogo Alves was born in Galicia in 1810 and traveled to Lisbon early in his life, where he soon took to a life of crime. He would stand on a 200-foot-tall aqueduct awaiting farmers who were commuting back from the city at night, divest them of their gains by whatever means possible, and unceremoniously push them to their deaths. Alves repeated this sequence 70 times in the three years he was active in the Aqueduto, but eventually moved on to robbing homes and murdering their occupants. Eventually he was apprehended, tried, and executed. But why is Alves’ head in a jar? Timing, most likely. Alves was executed in 1841, as phrenology was just beginning to rear its ugly head in Portugal. We recognize phrenology as a pseudoscience today, but back then its premises were simple and its conclusions downright revolutionary: the brain housed all aspects of an individual’s personality in physically distinct areas, and the shape of the skull reflected this internal organization. Personality traits, criminal propensity included, could be felt, palpated and measured right on the individual’s skull. It is no surprise, then, that a notoriously wicked corpse would draw the attention of Portugal’s budding band of phrenologists—who requested Alves’ head be severed and preserved for posterity, so the source of his criminal urges could be studied in depth. There is little evidence that such a study of Alves’ personality ever took place in the University, though similar ones did. The skull of Francisco Mattos Lobo, a contemporary of his who butchered a family of four and defenestrated their dog, was examined by phrenologists in April 1842 and rests just two doors down the hallway, in a glass case of patinaed skulls, that, it seems, do not get nearly as many visits as Alves himself. This part of the university is only open to students and is not typically accessible by the public.",phrenology medical experiments preserved specimens strange science medical museums universities crime and punishment memento mori
57,Chapel of Nossa Senhora das Vitórias,"São Miguel, Portugal","This fairy-tale, neo-Gothic church in the Azores is a world of magical realism.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapel-of-nossa-senhora-das-vitorias,"At the edge of the tropical tree line of Lagoa das Furnas there is a charming lake in the middle of São Miguel Island. Emerging from this fairytale landscape is the slim tower of a neo-Gothic church that dates to 1882. What began as a testament to the ailing wife of a wealthy Azorean gardener and amateur botanist, ended up as one of the most evocative churches in the whole archipelago. Capella de Nossa Senhora das Vitórias, Chapel of Our Lady of Victories, was intended to honor Maria Guilhermina Taveira de Brum da Silveira, the wife of a local landowner named José Do Conto. She had fallen tragically and terminally ill, and her husband took it upon himself to create this magical lakeside chapel. Calling on his renowned design and landscaping talents, despite the structural elements the whole endeavor feels more like the soft-focus of magical realism than hard-edge gothic. Do Conto didn’t actually finish the work himself, but compelled it to be done before he passed away in 1898. Living to see its completion, his wish to be buried next to his wife was fulfilled, and both are there in the Chapel. There are 18 windows, mostly filled with bright stained glass that shine down colorful gospel depictions on the couple’s final resting place. There are no services held here, which gives it an ancient, abandoned, and even timeless feeling as the natural elements take over. It stands like an old tree, firmly rooted and infused into the forest. Between the Chapel, the gardens, the lake, and the surrounding mountains, it stands out as one of the most endearing and rustic places in the Azores. From the center of the town of Furnas, it's about a four mile drive heading south down EN1-1A. Turn right onto the dirt road with the lake signs, just after the lake on your right. The Chapel is about a quarter mile down, across from Lagoa das Furnas. There are views of the Chapel on just about any walk around the lake, but to get a closer look (and maybe a peek inside) you can pay a few euros for admission into the nearby José do Canto Forest Garden. You can get directly to the Chapel and its gardens, and also to waterfalls, art installations, and other abandoned structures scattered around the winding paths of the Chapel’s backyard.",botanical gardens lakes gardens islands churches water plants sacred spaces

Husky rock formations frame each pool—one for kids, one for adults—making them look like little oases at the ocean’s edge. In fact, the pools are lined, like any other, with plain old drab concrete. While clearly visible, the concrete fades into its rocky surroundings like some desert mineral, emphasizing the fluid relationship between nature and artifice. The swimmers, too, become part of the setting. Visitors enter the complex on a walkway that obscures the passing traffic and even mutes the ocean’s waves. Then, after leaving the changing rooms, they look toward the pools that seem almost to tip into the vast Atlantic, like they’re walking the world’s most peaceful plank. Completed in 1966, the tidal pools brought major attention to a young Álvaro Siza Vieira, who is now one of Portugal’s most celebrated architects. Siza Vieira won architecture’s highest prize, the Pritzker, in 1992, and Portugal designated his tidal pools a National Monument in 2006.  Swimming is limited to summer months (June to September, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.), but the site is open year-round for architectural observance.",swimming pools beaches oceans rocks water monuments geology architectural oddities architecture

Instead, just sit back and bask in the glory of having discovered an incredible spot to wander and enjoy the sunset. Unlike at many of Portugal’s other beaches, you won’t find many other tourists crowding this wonderfully secluded spot. Accessing this beach is no small feat, but once you’re down on the sand, gazing at the beach’s spectacular view of the ocean, it will be totally worth it. Determined travelers must hike (read: climb) down a steep hill face of dirt, grass, and loose rocks to reach the golden sand paradise. But once there, unique limestone rock formations and sea stacks waiting to be explored tower above the picturesque stretch of earth. The rocks look inviting to climbers, but just make sure not to be fooled by the wide availability of hand and footholds in the cliff faces—they have more rock pieces ready to fall away under your feet than it first seems. (Don’t fret, adrenaline junkies, you can climb away, just be careful.) Swimming and wading in the water are possible even in the colder months, but beware, the waves and currents can be quite strong, so do take caution.  Because of its perfect western exposure, Praia da Ursa is an ideal sunset viewpoint. If you view the sunset from down on the beach, make sure to bring a flashlight to make climbing back up the cliff easier as it starts to get darker. The sunset is just as beautiful if viewed from the top of the cliff as well, so you can also check it out as you climb back up after spending some time frolicking in the wonderland below.",beaches hidden nature

It is known as a convent, but it was built in 1160 as a headquarters for the Knights Templar, the formidable Catholic military that answered to the Pope. When sovereigns feared the Pope had too much power, they annihilated the Knights Templar. In France, many were burned at the stake. In Portugal however, King Denis I took pity, and instead renamed the knights the Order of Christ. This new order would answer to the King, but was later demilitarized and converted to an entirely religious order. The subsequent heads of the Order added on to the castle in the centuries to follow. Additions included cloisters, connecting corridors, an aqueduct, and an expanded chapel, not to mention decadent ironworks, paintings, and tapestries. All of these were built in the various prevailing styles of the day, from Romanesque to Gothic to Renaissance. The greatest architectural draw is the Manueline chapel, an ornate architectural style found only in Portugal. Today, the Convento de Cristo is preserved as a museum. It has been a World Heritage site since 1983.

61,Bom Jesus do Monte,"Braga, Portugal",A stunning 18th-century site where pilgrims ascend by a series of punishing stairs only to return via funicular.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bom-jesus-do-monte,"The religious site at Bom Jesus do Monte’s roots date all the way back to the 14th century, when the tradition of making pilgrimage (especially to anywhere on high) blossomed as a way for devotees to demonstrate their faith, often in extremely physical manners. Built in a complex assemblage of architectural styles, it follows that nearly a century passed before the majority of Bom Jesus was completed. Each feature of the site contains its own symbology, independent of the others, making the entire site packed with visually arresting, bizarre details. The staircases themselves are Baroque in style, with granite steps and a white façade. Take for instance, the perpetually-flowing fountains found on the staircases’ landings. It would be easy to miss that each is dedicated to one of the five senses (touch, smell, taste, sight, sound), the effect of which can be incredibly disconcerting on an individual level when removed from the collective whole. Or, to cite another example, each zig-zagging staircase pivot becomes an octagonal oratory, inside of which is a life-size diorama from the day leading up to the crucifixion of Christ. To Catholics, this is simply known as the “Stations of the Cross” but to the uninitiated, the gruesome realism in which these scenes are rendered lends the aesthetic beauty of Bom Jesus a wholly unnerving and startling quality. After climbing all 577 steps – on foot or knee, the latter of which continues to be preferred by traditionalists – the Stations of the Cross culminate inside the sanctuary church perched atop the mountain. Designed by local architect André Soares and built by Carlos Amarante, the church was meant as an impressive replacement for a series of modest chapels shown by records to have occupied the mountain from the 14th century onward. Inside, Jesus has arrived at his destiny upon the cross, flanked by Mary, and Pontius Pilate’s soldiers. Looking up to the rafters offers a less bleak view, including an elegantly painted central dome surrounded by leaded glass. Meanwhile the Sanctuary’s surrounding grounds afford visitors the opportunity to roam manicured gardens while absorbing breathtaking views of the nearby city of Braga. Everything about climbing Bom Jesus feels like an adventure mixed with a gothic rune hunt, but the option to descend by way of funicular may be the most purely delightful element of the visit. The car itself was built in 1882 and continues to this day to be powered entirely by water, making it completely energy neutral. For a mere €1, the funicular transports passengers up and/or down the nearly 1,000 foot slope in just three minutes. At the time of one reporter’s visit, the mature, jovial funicular operator was tasked with both operating the tram and photographing tourists atop a stuffed horse outside the Sanctuary, using a hooded camera and wooden tripod system that appeared to be as old as the funicular itself.

A hidden three-foot-wide house separates the two structures. The house is so thin, it’s easy to mistake it for a wall. Igreja dos Carmelitas Descalços was built in the 17th century for Carmelite nuns, and Igreja do Carmo was built in the 18th century for Carmelite monks. Both churches are extravagant sights to behold, making it easy to completely miss the small, humble house standing between them. There are a number of local stories about why these churches are side by side. The most common tale says it’s because the archbishops couldn’t get along, so one built a church next door to the other in the ultimate architectural spite move. But in reality, the churches don’t actually touch each other, thanks to the house wedged between them. Local guides give two different reasons for the skinny house’s existence. Some chalk it up to an old law stipulating that two churches couldn’t share a wall. Others say the strange home was erected to keep the nuns and monks from getting too cozy with one another. What’s most amazing is that people actually lived within the unbelievably narrow abode. It was even inhabited up until the 1980s.

The Portuguese cottage seemed too unlikely to be real and doubters immediately sprang upon the home as a photoshop hoax. Those doubting the authenticity certainly had their evidence. Most of the photos of the house were taken only from two angles, and the had clearly been edited significantly. People set up in camps of opposing internet communities, each stating their cases and hoping to sway cyberspace toward their conclusion. After intense debate, a conclusion bolstered by a Portuguese television channel special and an article in the Daily Mall tipped the scale. Despite some artistic liberties on the part of the photographer, the house in the Fafe countryside was in fact real. The house has even been featured in a Portuguese film called “Moon.” Sandwiched improbably between two boulders in the midst of majestic Portuguese countryside, the Stone House is a wonder. The construction was inspired by the Flintstones. The interior is simple and sparse and makes a strong architectural statement. It is also worthwhile to be reminded that in an age where anything can be fabricated, the world is a big place and holds wonders beyond photoshop. The property is now surrounded by a 1.5m wire and barned wire fence on all sides. The front slip also is covered with bracken.  The small swimming pool building is an area to investigate. From Fafe take the N311 to Moreira de Rei and just before the exit to Varzea Cova go right up the hill on a stone road to Lameirinha. The road is very steep and care must be taken.

The giant industrial center that now houses the eclectic Electricity Museum was once a fully functional coal-burning power plant. The plant was originally built across multiple decades in the early 20th century, finally reaching completion in the 1950s. During its life, the power complex provided juice for all of Lisbon, as well as being a rather lovely example of industrial architecture in and of itself. Eventually the power plant became obsolete, but its lovely looks remained. It wasn’t until 1990 that the space was converted into a museum space. The whole complex then got a make-over in the early 2000s. The old boilers were polished up, the creaky machinery was refurbished, and the variety of exhibitions on display was expanded. Today, the gleaming old machines still remain on display, and are joined by several fascinating interactive exhibits on electricity including a Jacob’s Ladder, and a rotating art exhibit. The contemporary art on display changes regularly, ensuring that while the old power plant continues to age, it never gets old. History tends to thrive in museums, but here the history of electricity thrives BECAUSE it’s a museum.",museums and collections art museums
68,Mina de São Domingos (Sao Domingos Mines),Portugal,An abandoned mine now resembles a post-apocalyptic landscape of derelict buildings and blood-red pools of water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mina-de-sao-domingos-sao-domingos-mine,"With its derelict abandoned buildings, blood-red rivulets of water, and barren fields, a visit to the post-apocalyptic landscape of the abandoned São Domingo mine is a haunting experience. Located in the Alentejo region of Portugal, the now-deserted mine was first used by the Phoenicians and the Romans. It was rediscovered in the 19th century and leased to the British mining operation that, keen to capitalize on the growing demand for copper, constructed an entire village near the mines, including houses, offices, sports facilities, a theater, a church, an electricity station, and a telephone exchange. During its peak, it was one of the largest mining operations in Europe, employing thousands of workers. Most of the workers were Portuguese while managers were brought in from England and lived in a separate section of the village. Until World War I, copper was the main product, but it was replaced by sulphur when the use of sulphuric acid became more widespread. The workers had to survive in hazardous conditions, and often developed health problems as a result of their constant exposure to the mine’s chemicals. By the 1960s, the mine’s resources were exhausted and it was no longer viable to run. It shut down in ‘66—the facilities were abandoned, leaving nothing but a ghost village with extremely polluted water and soil. The pools of water are red from the iron and acidic from the chemical buildup over the years. Today the haunting landscape itself draws visitors, and the former managers’ houses have been converted into a hotel, while an old miner’s hut houses a small museum with some artifacts. The location can be accessed freely at any time. There are ruins close to the village. The more impressive parts of the mine can be found more remotely and can be reached by a hike. Please consider that it can be really hot during the summer, so you'd better take enough water with you.",abandoned mines mines ghost towns abandoned history

Below the church’s three interior chapels, catacombs hold tombs for members of the Franciscan order as they await judgment day. Discreetly tucked in a corner of the crypt, in front of a hellish door to nowhere lies a glass, grated window in the floor allowing visitors to view the piles of human bones below their feet. Such contrasts between earthy abundance and eternal austerity abound, including creaking floorboards numbering the dead’s tombs beneath one’s feet juxtaposed with an estimated 400kg of gold covering the ornate wood carvings and statues just one level above.

70,Violet Volcanic Tea,"Furnas, Portugal","When Azorean green tea meets volcanic hot springs water, a luminous brew is born.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/volcanic-tea-furnas-azores,"The island of São Miguel in the Portuguese Azores boasts lush, rolling tea plantations in orderly emerald lines, with pink camellias yawning beside rock walls and blush-purple hydrangeas blooming along craggy volcanic pools. In the small town of Furnas on the eastern side of the island, simmering springs thicken the air with steam. When this spring water combines with one of the island’s signature teas, the brew—originally golden-green—turns an inky indigo. The Azores are an autonomous chain of Portuguese islands located in the mid-Atlantic between the Portuguese mainland and Morocco. As such, São Miguel’s subtropical climate makes it home to some of Europe’s only tea plantations, Chá Gorreana and Tea Porto Formoso. While green and black teas are plentiful across the island, São Miguel also offers its own unique variety: purple volcanic tea. At Chalet de tia Mercês, a tea shop in Furnas, brewers use tapped volcanic spring water to brew this singular violet tea. Its color is the product of a chemical reaction between the antioxidants in the tea and unoxidized iron in the spring water. The flavor of the luminous purple brew is earthy, with clay-like notes. The volcanos are employed in making more than just tea, as well. Visitors to Furnas can also taste cozido das Furnas, a Portuguese chicken, pork, and vegetable stew cooked in the natural volcanic heat. After enjoying their tea and stew, visitors can themselves steep in one of the island’s many swimmable springs.  The Azores’ unique tea plantations reveal part of the history of Europe’s love for the beverage. While the drink was already popular in Europe, Azoreans first imported tea for cultivation from India and Japan in the 1860s, following a blight that wiped out São Miguel’s orange crop. Unsure how to grow tea, Azorean farmers enlisted the help of Lau-a-Teng, a Chinese tea expert, and a number of other Chinese tea farmers, to help develop the industry. The Portuguese word for tea, chá, itself contains hints of this complex history: The Portuguese initially traded for tea via Macau, where locals used the Chinese word cha (茶) to describe the precious brew.",beverages hot springs tea colorful consumables volcanoes water geology

But if you take a second to follow the signs for the public toilet, you’ll descend only a short way down the stairs before seeing a tiny tunnel whose curved archway is covered on both sides in a cartoon comic strip depiction of the history of Lisbon by muralist Nuno Saraiva. If you’re lucky, you’ll even encounter a tour guide with a small group of visitors and can eavesdrop on what they’re being told about this piece. But if you can’t catch a tour, know that the mural starts with the Phoenicians founding the city they called Ulissipo, continues through the Portuguese Inquisition, depicts the devastating Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755, and ends nicely with the Carnation Revolution in 1974. Much has changed in Lisbon since the revolution, a coup on April 25, 1974, that overthrew a dictator to restore democracy in Portugal, and this may be why the artist has chosen to end the illustration with that event.

Built in the 1980s as a speculative draw to tourists who had not yet caught on to the Azores as a vacation spot, the hotel is a massive, multi-floor behemoth designed with sharp, terraced roofs reminiscent of a pagoda. Overlooking a picturesque lake, the grand hotel featured a cavernous indoor courtyard and winding spiral staircases leading to the 88 rooms. Every type of amenity was provided as well, from two restaurants, a bar, a bank, a hairdresser, and even a black-lit nightclub. Everything a traveler on holiday might want or need was provided right at the top of the mountain. That is of course, should anyone want to make the trek in the first place. Unfortunately, it seems that not many people did. After opening in 1989, the hotel only operated for a little more than a year before shutting its doors. According to reports, for about a decade the empty halls were patrolled by guards and dogs, but with no one interested in paying them any longer, it seems that they simply disappeared sometime in the mid-2000s. Now urban explorers who are willing to make the trek to the mountaintop resort can explore its desiccated ballrooms and crumbling halls seemingly at their leisure. Update: In 2017, the real estate group Level Constellation purchased the property with the intent to rehabilitate the property. It is slated to reopen in 2021.

The transportation hub located in the heart of Porto does more than shuttle people back and forth. The French Beaux-Arts structure holds within 20,000 magnificent azulejo tin-glazed ceramic tiles depicting Portugal’s past - its royalty, its wars, and its transportation history. The blue and white tiles were placed over a period of 11 years (1905–1916) by artist Jorge Colaço. Built in 1900, the beautiful station was named after a Benedictine monastery that once occupied its space back in the 16th century. Destroyed by fire in 1783, the house of worship was rebuilt but by the 19th century was torn down to make way for the expanding railway system. Built by architect José Marques da Silva, the very first stone was laid by King Carlos I himself. Five years after the station was built, the intricate tile work began. Included in the landscapes and ethnographic displays are the Battle of Valdevez (1140) and the Conquest of Ceuta (1415) along with several other important events and places that created the vibrant city that this unusual and beautiful station resides in.

74,Mafra Palace Library,"Mafra, Portugal","At night, bats patrol this magnificent 18th-century space in search of book-eating pests.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mafra-palace-library-bats,"The wooden Rococo bookshelves of the grand Mafra Palace Library hold some 36,000 leather-bound volumes dating from the 14th to the 19th centuries. Book-eating pests would pose a great threat to these old tomes were it not for the inch-long bats who patrol the library at night. Upon its completion in 1755, the magnificent Palace of Mafra immediately staked its claim as one of the national treasures of Portuguese architecture. And within the palace sits an equally impressive library, which ranks among the finest in Europe. The 280-foot long Rococo-style library is a fitting home for the thousands of valuable old volumes that line the wooden bookshelves. These books are fragile things, however, and bookworms, moths, and other insects can wreak havoc on their delicate pages. Most libraries control such pests with ethylene oxide, methyl bromide, or gamma radiation, but the Mafra Palace Library has a very special force of airborne defenders: bats. During the day, a colony of bats sleeps behind the bookcases or out in the palace garden. At night, after the library has closed, these small bats swoop between the stacks, hunting down the very pests that would otherwise chomp through the pages of the library’s precious collection. This nocturnal feasting has been going on for centuries, perhaps as far back as the creation of the library itself. The winged protectors, however, do come with one disadvantage: the copious covering of droppings they expend upon the floors, shelves, and furniture each and every night. To combat this, library workers cover the furniture before they leave, and spend their mornings carefully cleaning the marble floors to erase all evidence of the previous night’s excreta. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Mafra Palace Library bats.  The Mafra Palace Library is open to researchers, historians, and scholars “whose object of study justifies the access to this collection,” as stated by the palace website. A previous appointment is recommended. Because the bats only hunt at night, you’re unlikely to see them during visiting hours.

Supposedly, the devil himself conjured up the structure. He was, after all, a rather nifty builder (at least according to medieval legends). According to local lore, a criminal was in dire need of a way to cross the river while fleeing the nearby village. He summoned the devil, who kindly said he’d help the man—for the small price of his soul, of course. The man agreed, and the devil created a temporary bridge that vanished before those pursuing the convict could cross as well. Supposedly, the bandit felt so remorseful he later sought out a priest to repent. A virtuous priest took pity on the man and used his Rosary and a bit of holy water to expel the devil and turn the bridge into a permanent structure. Modern visitors to the Misarela Bridge won’t have to worry about it vanishing beneath their feet. The sturdy stones allow anyone to walk (or flee, if they must) across the river. In fact, in the early 19th century, French troops did use the bridge to flee from British forces during the Peninsular War. While you’re there, be sure to take in the views of the surrounding nature. Trees and plants fill the space, their verdant cover creeping down the hillside until it meets the water and rocks.

But locals continued adding the gnarled weights to honor the small tuna fishing community that once flourished in the area. The anchors were used to weigh down the nets for catching tuna. They’re lined up in rows and exist without any real pomp or officiality. Fishing in the area was a dangerous and difficult profession, but the unpredictable waters where the Atlantic meets the Mediterranean were bustling with bluefin tuna. The technique for catching them was unique to the area, and was probably invented by the ancient Romans who colonized the area. Algarve thrived on tuna fishing for centuries, but local fisherman had to give up their occupation in the 1960s when the numbers of fish declined. Their anchors were just left on the beach to rust—until someone came up with the artistic idea.  Access to the island and Barril Beach from the village of Santa Luzia is across a bridge and then a 1.2km footpath. Alternatively there is a miniature railway along 1km of the route (formerly used by the fishing community to transport goods and freshly caught fish) which operates a mini-train during peak times.",ship graveyards fishing shipwrecks archaeology cemeteries
77,Church of Santa Engrácia,"Lisbon, Portugal","Portugal's National Pantheon has a history of curses, collapses and financial problems.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-of-santa-engracia,"The Church of Santa Engrácia has existed in various forms since the 16th Century. Structural collapses and financial woes have seen it change form and lie dormant over the centuries, but not even a curse could stop it from rising once again to become the hallowed National Pantheon in which the most honored Portuguese are laid to rest. Around 1568, Maria of Portugal, the only daughter of King Manuel I of Portugal and one of the wealthiest women in Europe, sponsored the construction of a church dedicated to Saint Engrácia. It soon became the religious center for a powerful religious sect known as the Brotherhood of the Slaves of the Holy Sacrament. In 1630, the church experienced is first major incident. In January of that year, the church’s interior was desecrated. Some of its images, statues, a tabernacle and other religious objects were destroyed. The Brotherhood placed the blame on Simon Solis, a member of the Nova Christian faction. Despite having a solid alibi – he had been with a woman (some say a nun) all that night–Solis was taken by the Brotherhood and sentenced to death. His hands were cut off, he was dragged through the streets of Lisbon, and then burned to death on a pyre. A year later, another man pleaded guilty to the crime, and Solis’s name was cleared but Solis hadn’t died without a fight. In his last days, he cursed the Church of Santa Engrácia, saying how the restoration work would never be completed and the building would be doomed to a state of eternal limbo. His curse almost worked. The Holy Slaves had decided not only to restore the church but also to rebuild and expand it. These reconstruction efforts were hindered by a succession of problems, both financial and political, troubling Portugal at the time. The rebuilding project was put on hold due to a lack of funds and, in 1681, the inadequately supported church structure collapsed, almost completely destroying the building. Construction soon began afresh, this time under the watchful eye of João Antunes, the royal architect and one of the most important baroque architects in Portugal’s history. It was Antunes who was responsible for the current church’s unusual but undeniably beautiful design. It was built in the form of a Greek cross (a cross with arms of equal length) with square towers in each corner, undulating walls, and an interior designed with an eye for geometric symmetry. Before the church was completed, however, Antunes died. In 1712, it sat with an unfinished dome and no lead architect. Fearing past collapses, and perhaps the curse of Solis, doubts were raised about the structure’s ability to support itself. With no one willing to take a financial risk in backing the stalled project, the church remained in an unfinished, precarious state for almost 200 years. Local residents doubted that it would ever be finished, leading to the Portuguese phrase, still in use, of “Obras de Santa Engrácia” (“Works of Santa Engrácia”) a synonym for endless construction projects. Finally, in 1916, a project began to convert the church into a National Pantheon. It still took 50 years to complete, but it was eventually finished, despite the best efforts of the wronged Simon Solis. Today, the National Pantheon holds the remains of many of Portugal’s most respected modern figures, including past presidents, celebrated writers and Eusébio, Portugal’s greatest sporting hero and one of the best soccer players of all time.  The Church of Santa Engrácia is located in the Alfama neighborhood, not far from the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora. It is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. You can get to the church by bus (buses 12, 28, 34, 35, 704, 745, 759, 781, 782 all go there), tram (line 28), or via the underground (blue line, Santa Apolónia Station).",

Its main attraction is the circular lagoon on the islet, which is broken up by a tiny channel that connects it with the ocean. The result is a clear and calm pool that is perfect for swimming and diving. The islet and this natural pool are accessible only during the summer and their stunning geography has made them a popular destination. Erosion through continuous exposure to wind and water have created different rock formations around the islet, including a fascinating column-like structure. Over the years, the islet has helped whalers spot their targets and has also served as a military fort. In 1983, the unique location was declared a nature reserve to protect the endemic vegetation around the crater, as well as the crustaceans and birds who have made the islet their home.",craters swimming pools pools volcanoes natural wonders geology nature

The site consists of several classic megalithic structures, primarily cromlechs, and menhir stones. Arranged in patterns of two concentric rings – an eastern circle and a larger oval in the west – the 95 almond-shaped stones seen today represent a gradual process of accumulation and redistribution over time. The smaller ring to the east is the oldest section of the site, constructed during the early Neolithic period circa 6000 BCE, while the western oval ring is thought to have been built during the Almendres era 5000 BCE. During a third period around 3000 BCE, many of the stones seem to have been repositioned to better align with the moon, sun and stars. As is common with such ancient sites, the purpose of Almendres Cromlech remains unknown. With the stones’ final repositioning to be in-line with celestial bodies, geometric patterns already found at Almendres Cromlech were strengthened further, making the intentionality of the stones’ presence and arrangement undoubtable, even if the deeper rationale and rituals contained therein remain a mystery.

But this is Corvin Castle, which looks like something straight out of a fairytale, largely because restorers thought that it should. Built in the mid-15th century, the castle was the work of military leader John Hunyadi, who constructed the tall structure over the remains of a keep built by Charles I. Corvin Castle is split into three large areas: The Knight’s Hall, the Diet Hall, and the circular stairways. Each of these three parts is surrounded by both circular and rectangular towers that were used for both defense and as a prison. The elaborate architecture was designed in a rich gothic style that accentuates the already impressive structure. The castle was kept in regal condition during Hunyadi’s lifetime, but after he died, the castle fell into swift decline. It was not until the 17th century that there was more interest in restoring this medieval castle. As the restoration work began, the workers redesigned the castle to reflect what they considered a gothic castle should look like, which explains much of its currently fanciful look. A number of legends are associated with the castle. Though this is likely untrue, tourists are told that Vlad the Impaler spent some seven years in the dungeons of Corvin Castle, a stay which resulted in his eventual madness.  The Castle is open daily, from 10:30 AM to 8:30 PM on Mondays, and from 9:00 AM and 8:30 PM from Tuesday to Sunday.

Salt extraction on the site’s surface started in antiquity, but the work expanded underground during the Roman occupation of Dacia. The salt was extracted manually using pickaxes, hammers, chisels, and steel wedges, by free people who were paid in florins, ale, and loaves of bread. The mine was closed in 1932, but it was used again during World War II as a bomb shelter. After the war, the mine served several purposes, one of which was a warehouse for storing cheese.

84,Bran Castle,"Bran, Romania","The possible imprisonment of Vlad the Impaler here earned the medieval castle its nickname, ""Dracula's Castle.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bran-castle,"In the center of Romania is a medieval castle believed to have once held  Vlad Tepes Dracula, commonly known as “Vlad the Impaler” as a prisoner. The infamous Romanian ruler was immortalized as the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel, “Dracula,”.  The novel is believed to be inspired by the Romanian folklore lady serial killer Countess Elizabeth Bathory. Thanks to this loose link to the famous vampire, Bran Castle is popularly known in the region and beyond as “Dracula’s Castle.” Bran Castle was built between 1377 and 1388 atop a strategic site overlooking a heavily trafficked mountain pass between Transylvania and Wallachia, the land over which Vlad the Impaler ruled in the 15th century. Also known as Vlad III Dracula, the ruler is widely believed to be the inspiration for Count Dracula due to his historic bloodlust. He liked to torture people and would impale his enemies on the battlefield to deter his other enemies. During invasions, he was also known to use the scorched-earth policy, a military strategy that consists of destroying any possible resource that the enemy could use by poisoning water supplies and burning crops. Although the famous Wallachian ruler might have passed several times near Bran, there is no historical document attesting that he ever visited it. His visits to Transylvania were usually related to the boyars of Brașov. After his first reign, when he was sent into exile, he wanted to settle in Brașov, but John Hunyadi forbade them to provide him with shelter. The castle is owned by the descendants of Queen Marie, to whom it was given 1920 as a token of appreciation for her efforts to unify Romania. After her death, Bran Castle was inherited by her daughter, Princess Ileana, who ran it as a hospital during World War II. In 1948 the castle was seized by the Communist regime, but it was returned to Dominic von Habsburg, Princess Ileana’s son, in 2006. Currently, Bran is open as a museum, largely devoted to Queen Marie of Romania. The castle is also a popular location for Halloween events, like the 2016 competition to win the chance to stay in the castle Halloween night, retracing the steps of Jonathan Harker from the opening pages of Bram Stoker’s novel. Bram Stoker never visited central Europe, and there are other castles with more solid claims on Dracula’s legend, but underground passages and ancient weapons and armor, and not to mention all the creepy sounds the medieval building makes, make the Bran Castle an experience worthy of the vampire’s name.",dracula vampires fortresses castles mountains legends
85,Peleș Castle,"Sinaia, Romania","This elaborately decorated, fairytale-like Romanian royal palace is one of the most striking castles in Europe.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peles-castle,"When King Carol I of Romania visited the small village of Sinaia in the foothills of the Bucegi mountains in the 1860s, he was captivated by its scenic location and commissioned the construction of a palace there. The resulting castle is easily one of the most stunning in all of Europe. The construction took 10 years, but by the end of it, the Romanian royals had a summer palace equipped with everything from a movie theater to a concert hall. The ornate 160-room palace was built in a Neo-Renaissance style and each room had its own identity and theme. After its inauguration in 1883, the king and his family began spending their summers in the fairytale castle, which also served as the venue for important meetings during the early months of World War I. The first couple to live there, King Carol I and his wife Queen Elizabeth of Romania were known to be very different in temperament and interests. The king was an accomplished soldier who greatly expanded and improved the Romanian military, and the queen was more artistic, with a great fondness for music, art, and literature, and even published poetry under the pen name Carmen Sylva. Peleș, too, was a reflection of these two different personalities. On one hand, there was an extensive 4,000-piece collection of weaponry from Europe and Asia on display in the Weapons Room. On the other, there was a beautifully appointed movie theater, whose walls and ceilings were decorated with frescoes by Austrian artists Gustav Klimt and Franz von Matsch. The first movie projection in Romania is reported to have taken place in this room. Other art forms were far from neglected. The Music Room contained intricate pieces of teak furniture gifted by the Indian Maharajah of Kapurtala and was used as a salon by Queen Elizabeth. King Carol’s successor, King Ferdinand built a smaller version of this grand palace right next door to it and named it Pelișor. When Romania fell under Communist rule, Peleș, along with other royal properties, were seized, and the castle was closed between 1975 and 1990. Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu had his eye on it as potential protocol residence but this plan was thwarted by the caretakers of the castle who told him that fungus was growing inside and this would be detrimental for its residents. After the revolution of 1989, it was reopened to the public as a museum.  You can take the train from Brașov or Bucharest to the stop in Sinaia. The castle is within walking distance, though taking a taxi may be preferable. Tickets have two price points: one for touring the first floor only, and one for touring both floors. There is also an additional fee for taking photographs inside the castle. During its winter schedule, between September 14th and May 14th, the castle is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. During the summer schedule, the castle is closed only on Mondays. Peleș Castle is included in the Romania: Castles, Ruins, and Medieval Villages trip.",palaces castles art history architecture
86,Snagov Monastery,"Snagov Island, Romania",This solitary monastery may hold the remains of Vlad the Impaler (but probably not).,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snagov-monastery,"On a tiny island in a lake just outside of Bucharest stands Snagov Monastery which local tradition states is the burial place of Vlad the Impaler, the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Originally founded in the 14th century and later excavated in 1933, the monastery is a seemingly simple place of worship taking advantage of the calm its water-locked isolation brings. However, the story goes that after his notoriously cruel lifetime, Vlad Tepes III was buried in the church as per his request prior to his death. A number of archeologists and historians have worked to verify whether this tale is fact or simple apocrypha and none have been able to prove that the dictator was ever laid to rest on the island. After having dug up some of the site’s burial stones all that was found were a mix of horse and human bones, but nothing that confirms the possible Dracula’s interment. Most historians now believe that the Prince of Wallachia was buried in a monastery in the Comana area, but this has not stopped the locals from spreading the spurious myth. A footbridge has been built to the island and visitors are encouraged to stop by the Snagov Monastery and view the supposed grave.  However, the caretakers now charge anyone who wants to take pictures. The Romanian government even began plans to capitalize on the church’s unverifiable history by building an amusement park in Snagov called “Dracula Park” although development was mercifully canceled in 2006.",catacombs and crypts graveyards islands cemeteries churches sacred spaces
87,The Merry Cemetery,"Săpânța, Romania",A small town Romanian cemetery filled with darkly humorous gravestones.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/merry-cemetery,"When someone dies, their memory generally enters a kind of idealized state in the minds of those who loved them. Their flaws are forgiven and forgotten, and the way in which they passed (especially if it was unpleasant) often goes unspoken. Only the sweet stories about the person are retold. On their tombstone generalized niceties are written, often reduced to as little as “Rest in Peace.” Not so in the town of Săpânţa, Romania, where at the Cimitirul Vesel or “Merry Cemetery,” over 800 wooden crosses bear the life stories, dirty details, and final moments of the bodies they mark. Displayed in bright, cheery pictures and annotated with limericks are the stories of almost everyone who has died of the town of Săpânţa. Illustrated crosses depict soldiers being beheaded and a townsperson being hit by a truck. The epigraphs reveal a surprising level of truth. “Underneath this heavy cross. Lies my mother in law poor… Try not to wake her up. For if she comes back home. She’ll bite my head off.” Stan Ioan Pătraş was born in Săpânţa in 1908, and at the age of 14 he had already begun carving crosses for the local cemetery. By 1935, Pătraş had begun carving clever or ironic poems—done in a rough local dialect—about the deceased, as well as painting the crosses with the deceased’s image, often including the way in which the individual died in the image. Stan Ioan Pătraş soon developed a careful symbolism in his work. Green represented life, yellow represented fertility, red for passion, black for death. The colors were always set against a deep blue, known as Săpânţa blue, which Pătraş believed represented hope, freedom, and the sky. Other symbolism—white doves for the soul, a blackbird to represent a tragic or suspicious death—worked their way onto the crosses, as did Pătraş’s dark sense of humor. Săpânţa is a small town with few secrets, and often the dirty details of the deceased made it onto the crosses. One reads “Ioan Toaderu loved horses. One more thing he loved very much. To sit at a table in a bar. Next to someone else’s wife.” The deceased town drunk has a grave showing a black skeleton dragging him down while he swigs from a bottle, noted in his epitaph as “real poison.” Pătraş singlehandedly carved, wrote poems for, and painted well over 800 of these folk art masterpieces over a period of 40 years. It wasn’t until near the end of his life, in the early 1970s, that the merry cemetery, as the town has dubbed it, was discovered by the outside world when a French journalist publicized it. Stan Ioan Pătraş died in 1977, having carved his own cross and left his house and work to his most talented apprentice, Dumitru Pop. Pop has since spent the last three decades continuing the work, carving the cemetery’s crosses, and has turned Stan’s house into the merry cemetery’s workshop-museum. He picks an oak for the grave slabs and fells the tree by himself. One famous epitaph reads: Underneath this heavy cross  / Lies my mother-in-law poor  / Had she lived three days more  / I would be here and she would read / You that are passing by / Try not to wake her up  / For if she comes back home  / She’ll bite my head off / But I will act in the way  / That she will not return  / Stay here my dear  Mother-in-law. Despite the occasionally dark comedy, or merely dark, tones of the crosses, Pop says no one has ever complained about the work. “It’s the real life of a person. If he likes to drink, you say that; if he likes to work, you say that… There’s no hiding in a small town… The families actually want the true life of the person to be represented on the cross.” Pop has one complaint about the work, that it can get repetitive. “Their lives were the same, but they want their epitaphs to be different.” Also, not all the carvings can be exhibited due to political reasons. A Romanian book called “The Crosses of Sapanta” lists all the epitaphs in the cemetery along with descriptions and insights into the meaning of the messages.  Drive in the direction of Siget. Once in Sapanta, in the middle of the town, you have to turn right. There is a signpost to tell you exactly where.",memento mori catacombs and crypts graves gravestones outsider art cemeteries
88,Poenari Castle,"Wallachia, Romania","The legendary cliffside castle of three-time Voivode of Wallachia, Vlad the Impaler.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/poenari-castle-vlad-the-impaler,"Even without its bloody historic ties, Poenari Castle, also known as Poenari Fortress, would be a majestic, exciting place to explore on its own merit. Architecture buffs would marvel at the 13th century mortar work, lovers of fantastic scenery would find the cliffside view mind-blowing. Poenari Castle doesn’t need a sordid story to be spectacular, but it happens to have that as well. The story is a legendary one and to many, a confusing mixture of truth, history, legend, and fiction due to the convolution between the novel “Dracula” and the factual history of Vlad III Dracula “The Impaler”, whose name inspired the book. Bram Stoker modeled some of his main character on the more basic facts about Dracula’s actual life, but his knowledge of Romanian history and the true story of Vlad the Impaler remains suspect. The true Dracula, (Turk-impaling Prince of Wallachia as opposed to the sultry blood sucker) fell in love with Poenari Castle in the 15th century, and realizing its potential as a major stronghold with an amazing vantage point, consolidated and fixed up the crumbling fortress, making it one of his main places of residence. It’s said that his first wife, whose name is debated among historians, flung herself from the towers of Poenari during a siege by Vlad’s muslim brother, Radu Bey. Before flinging herself into the Arges River below, she exclaimed she would rather rot and be eaten by the fish than to be a captive of the Turks. In the end the walls of Poenari would not keep Dracul the Dragon safe, but it was not the fortress that failed him. Vlad’s brother Radu cel Frumos was given the daunting task of leading the Ottoman Empire to victory, which positioned him directly at odds with his infamously brutal older brother. While Vlad could not be defeated in battle, his habit of alienating allies and undermining their authority became his downfall. After running out of money for his mercenaries, he went to his supposed friends for help, and they quickly betrayed him, and had him arrested for high treason. While he managed to untangle himself and went on to declare a third reign, it was an uphill battle that eventually killed him, and he never returned to his castle on the hill. Poenari Castle is located on the right side of the Transfăgărăşan road in Argeş County, on a cliff near the Făgăraş Mountains. In 1888, a landslide brought a portion of the fortress crashing down the cliff, but otherwise the structure has been mildly maintained and can still be visited today, but there is quite a climb to reach the ruins – over 1,000 steps. Update as of June 2022: Currently closed for renovations.  There are tour buses that go directly to the castle from Bucarest. If you'd like to go on your own, the closest town is Arefu, the closest modern town is Curtea de Arges. From Curtea de Arges, you can catch a minibus to Arefu, and let the driver know you are headed for Poenari Castle. They will get you as close as possible, but there is no town too nearby the castle, so it's a walk. There are signs, and a small but bustling tourist area with an inn, gift shop and the like to help lead the way.",dracula eccentric homes castles homes ruins architectural oddities architecture

It was turned into a general store and later abandoned and left to decay as Communism collapsed. The grandson of the banker, who originally bought the building back in 1903 requested that it would be returned to his family, as legal heirs. It took 24 years of battles in court, untangling bureaucratic loops, and finding the proper documents in archives, but he finally took possession of the decaying building in 2007. He then began its remarkable transformation to the Cărturești Carusel (“Carousel of Light”) bookstore that stands today. The extensive renovation went above and beyond, creating a stunning shop considered to be one of the most beautiful bookstores in Romania, and even the world. Seventy-five people put in a combined 20,000 hours of work over the course of five years, rebuilding and customizing every bit of detail. The store’s three floors spread across more than 10,000 square feet that hold as many books.

It’s a magical, romantic place to discover. Glittering light filters through the trees, streaking the air and dappling the earth, giving the railway a mesmerizing photographic charm. Despite its recently acquired official European recognition, the tunnel remains relatively unknown among the public. The “Tunnel of Love” (Romania’s version of the famously beautiful Ukrainian tunnel) feels like an open secret shared among soon-to-be-married couples and photographers with a keen sense for scoping out special spots. The railway is a secondary non-electrified railway that was inaugurated between 1908 and 1909. After it was abandoned, nature began reclaiming the space. Trees and shrubs began stretching skyward, eventually forming a tunnel above the old metal tracks. Reaching the tunnel is part of the allure. Excitement builds as you reach the small commune of Obreja, which you’ll quickly pass through only to leave the quaint houses and old church behind to drive into the sprawling countryside. Only when you spot the dirt path along the side of the road will you know you’re on the right path to discovering the tunnel, which has been hiding in plain sight all along.  As you leave western Romanian city of Caransebes, go east along the country road No. 68 (DN68). You need to be on look out for a crossroad with an old railway, which is quietly touching the outskirts of the village only to dissolve itself into the forest nearby which seems to follow, almost unseen, the house lines on the horizon.

Commanding a dramatic location right on the waterfront of the Black Sea overlooking the ancient port at Constanța, the Casino was a triumph of the Art Nouveau movement, and quickly became the symbol of the city. Worsening circumstances in Romania over the 20th century saw it gradually fall into disrepair, briefly used as a hospital during World War II and eventually repurposed by the communist regime as a restaurant. Maintaining the elaborate structure quickly became prohibitively expensive, and the building was closed in 1990. Despite occasional efforts at restoration, it’s remained abandoned ever since. While it’s nominally owned by the municipality and technically closed to the public, Romanian authorities have never shown much interest in enforcing the closure. There are a lot of legends and secrets about how the casino was built. One such legend claims that Constanța Casino was built by a navigator whose daughter died young, at 17 years old. Her father, the story goes, decided to built the Casino for young people to share moments that his daughter couldn’t. If you look from the top, the casino supposed to look like a hearse and the windows like graves. Update as of September 2020: The casino is currently under construction and cannot be visited.

In reality, it’s the recent creation of a Romanian businessman. Decebal (Decebalus the Brave One) was the last king of Dacia. He was also one of the mightiest rulers of this ancient kingdom. After reuniting fragmented Dacian tribes, he fought three wars against two Roman emperors before finally succumbing to the power of Rome in 106. The national identity of modern Romania is still firmly rooted in its ancient Dacian heritage. This monumental stone portrait of Decebal is the brainchild of Iosif Constantin Dragan, a businessman and historian. It’s situated on the Romanian side of Danube, right opposite the Tabula Traiana, a memorial to the Roman conquest of Dacia. At 40 meters, it is is the tallest rock sculpture in Europe and took 10 years (from 1994 to 2004) for a team of 12 sculptors to complete. Inscription on the statue is, somewhat ironically, written in Latin—the language introduced to Romania by Decebal’s enemies.

From a certain angle, its outline resembles that of Egypt’s Great Sphinx of Giza. The odd formation is one of the “Seven Wonders of Romania.” Over millions of years, the elements carved the nearly 40-foot-tall rock until it resembled something akin to a woman’s face. But the figure’s human-like appearance isn’t the main attraction that draws people to it. The Mountain Sphinx (also known as the Sphinx of Bușteni) is a hotbed of folklore and conspiracy theories. Some say it’s a strong energetic force field, one of the Earth’s supposed chakras. Others say an ancient civilization carved it to represent some sort of supreme god. And, as with most mysterious places, there are people who claim aliens are somehow involved. Still others say it sits atop a cave guarded by an impenetrable force field, which may possibly hold anything from a library to an abandoned uranium mine to crystals containing all of humankind’s knowledge. People have even gone so far as to claim that the CIA and Romanian secret forces have attempted to penetrate whatever treasures the rock allegedly guards. Whether you decide to believe any of the legends or not, the Sphinx will still be there waiting, perched atop the mountain as it has been for millennia. And as for the supposed energy field, you’ll just have to feel it for yourself!  There are several hiking trails (of varying difficulty) to get here, leaving from the towns of Bușteni and Sinaia.

While the original builders of the Sinca Veche monastery cave are unknown, the site has been dated to around 7,000 years old. Regardless of who originally built out the space, it has been home to a number of different religious tenants, as evidenced by the strange melange of disparate religious symbols that have been carved into the walls of the temple. You can find a Star of David here, a Chinese yin-yang symbol there, but strangely no Christian crosses, despite the fact that there is other evidence of Christian habitation. The monastery is composed of nine different rooms, two of which act as separate chapels. Light enters the cave from a series of low windows and tall, chimney-like skylights. It has been speculated that these shafts were also there to symbolically let holy energy into the space. There is also speculation that there is a hidden tunnel that connects to a nearby fortress.

But one spot, just outside Sebeș, is interrupted by a jagged red anomaly. The city is guarded by the steep walls of the Râpa Roșie (Red Ravine), a geological reserve on the most southwesterly part of the Secaşelor Plateau. Over the last 60 million years, water has carved deep into the gravel, sandstone, and quartz of the plateau’s sublayer, creating unusual natural spiked towers and pyramid shapes in the red clay. The result is often compared to the Grand Canyon, though it’s not quite as massive; the ravine’s tallest peaks are about 300 feet. It is also ever-evolving: Heavy rains cause noticeable changes to the folds in the uniquely steep slopes. The Red Ravine remains relatively unknown, even to those who have lived nearby for years. There are however local tales of World War I soldiers passing through the ravine in order to get to Alba Iulia, where, at the end of the war, representatives declared the union of Transylvania and Romania. In 1950, the area, which is home to many rare and endemic plants and some of the largest caves in the world, was declared a natural monument.

Today, not much remains of this princely palace and its grounds other than ruins. But amidst the broken masonry and old stone arches, like a sentinel, the bust of Romania’s most notorious ruler, Vlad III Dracula, keeps watch over the medieval court. Almost 500 years before Irish novelist Bram Stoker immortalized his name, Vlad III Dracula ruled Wallachia, a province of now modern-day Romania. A bulwark against Ottoman Turkish aggression, Vlad, like his father and namesake, was sworn into the Order of the Dragon, an alliance of Christian rulers who fought against the Ottoman invaders. Known for his brutality on and off the battlefield, Vlad earned the name Tepes or “The Impaler” from the Turks for his preferred method of executing his enemies. Recognizing the city’s strategic location along the Dimbovita River near Wallachia’s southern border, Vlad III Dracula set up his summer residence in what was then known as “the Citadel of Bucharest,” and the city soon became the economic nucleus of Wallachia. Bucharest became the preferred residence of subsequent rulers and eventually the capital of Romania. The princely palace and court, too, gained prominence as the commercial and religious hub of the city. In 1559, Mircea Ciobanul, then ruler and descendant of Vlad III Dracula, built the palace as well as the nearby Annunciation Church of Saint Anthony. Over the centuries, the palace and the site have undergone additional construction, damage by the Ottomans, and renovation throughout its history. The site is now operated by Muzuel Municipiului Bucuresti and is currently closed for restoration.

Since no written documentation of its founding survives, its exact age is disputed. Theories about the structure’s origins abound, including that it was built on the site of a pagan temple, or served as a mausoleum for a Roman general. The Late Romanesque construction is curiously piecemeal, giving the impression that it was built in several stages, also incorporating stone from the nearby ruins of Roman Sarmizegetusa (Ulpia Traiana).

The preserved arm of the ancient magician, which rests in Zlătari Church, is believed by many to have the power to lift curses and spells when touched. According to the legend, Cyprian, before becoming a Christian, travelled around to places like Greece, Egypt, and India, and became a powerful sorcerer. When he finally settled in Antioch in Pisidia, near the modern-day Turkish town of Yalvaç, his reputation brought people to him asking for favors. One of these people was a fellow pagan who desired the hand of a Christian woman named Justina, who had taken private vows of chastity. The pagan asked Cyprian to cast a spell on Justina and induce her to fall in love with him. Cyprian summoned demons to corrupt her, but her prayers were too strong, and she made the sign of the cross, which thwarted their efforts. Cyprian was distraught by his failure, and, seeking forgiveness, made the sign of the cross as well, freeing himself from Satan’s hold and converting to Christianity. He burned his magic books and became a deacon, a priest, and a bishop. He was, alongside Justina, tortured and beheaded in 304 AD, during the Diocletian persecution. Their bodies were eventually entombed, so the story goes, in Constantine’s basilica. Evidence of their historical existence is very scarce, so in 1969 their feast day was removed from the calendar of Roman Rite celebrations, and in 2001 their names were removed from the official list of saints recognized by the Roman Catholic Church. Some Catholics continue to honor them, along with members of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches, including those who believe that St. Cyprian’s arm rests in Zlătari Church and is their best defense against magic worked against them. The church itself, a Romanian historic monument known as “a church of miracles” due to the alleged powers of St. Cyprian’s arm, got its name from the Roma goldsmiths, or “zlătari,” who lived in the neighborhood and built the original wooden church in the 17th century. It was rebuilt in 1850, after nearly being destroyed by earthquakes earlier in the 1800s, and is known for the beautiful frescoes by Gheorghe Tattarescu that decorate the walls and the door. The domes of the Zlătari Church were damaged by an earthquake in 1940 and repaired in the 70s. Development of the area in the 20th century has been the biggest contributor to changes in the appearance of the church, which used to include an inn and a bell tower, and was surrounded by a garden.

There’s something bizarre and comical about large mud bubbles forming and popping, the earth’s natural gas erupting up through salty, underground water and mud. The gray, thick clay-like mud dries, creating conical volcano shapes, and spew out surprisingly colorful mud bubbles that display an array of earth tone browns and ochres. Mud Volcanoes are very rare in Europe, making the Berca location a curious tourist spot and a must-see for photographers looking for unusual scenery. The lack of vegetation adds to the surreal landscape, but is unsurprising. What could possibly live in this unfriendly, salt-saturated environment? There are a few formidable little flora called halophyte plants, which won’t be thwarted by a little mud and salt. Nitraria schoberi and Obione verrucifera are two salt-tolerant shrubs that thrive in this otherwise inhospitable soil, thriving in salinity as only 2% of the plant world can. Sheltering these hardy plants is one of the main reasons the mud volcanoes was declared a natural reserve, and is now legally protected. The locals refer to these mud volcanoes as “The Gates of Hell,” not to be confused with Turkmenistan’s fiery, horrific Gates of Hell. They also brag of two separate locations quite simply dubbed Little Mud Volcanoes and The Big Mud Volcanoes. The area is difficult to get to, so private transport is suggested.

Up until the shockingly recent year of 1978, Geamana village was thriving with a markedly comfortable and happy populace living in a lush valley. Unfortunately it was this same year that rich reserves of copper were found in the nearby area, the mining of which created huge amounts of toxic waste that had to be disposed of. Seeing the Geamana valley as the perfect bowl in which to pour his newly cooked toxic soup, communist dictator and Romanian supervillain Nicolae Ceausescu ordered the village to be abandoned and flooded the entire valley. Once flooded with water, Ceausescu began dumping unfathomable amounts of sterile toxic elements into the new lake turning the waters into a multi-colored sludge, and erasing almost all memory of Geamana from the land save for a few rooftops and a lonely steeple breaching the morass. A majority of the citizens migrated to other villages nearby, but a few stubborn locals simply moved to the edges of the flood area where they continue to live today with no public infrastructure such as schools or doctors.

101,Zoological Museum,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",The Natural History Museum that time forgot.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zoological-museum,"The Zoological Museum, housed within the Babes-Bolyai University, can be rather difficult to locate. Rickety metal spiral staircases, long halls, unmarked doors: it can all be rather confusing. But the persistent will be rewarded when they locate the heavy doors labeled MUZEUL ZOOLOGIC. They may or may not be open. Try knocking. Once inside, this empty, dusty museum appears as if it has been untouched for a half century. Scruffy, ratty taxidermy fills glass cases, hangs from the ceiling, and peers down from an off-limits second floor. The first room is full of beautiful wood and glass display cases, each one laden with jars holding specimens of fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and other species. The display cases are double sided, so that the old specimens can be viewed every from every angle. In other rooms, large taxidermy tigers, bears, and giraffes stand by the walls, unprotected by display cases. Birds hang upside down, much too many for the bowing branches on which they are mounted. In the very back of the museum, at the time of this writing, two-headed calves were bring stored, visibly, in a roped-off area.

102,Romanian Kitsch Museum,"Bucharest, Romania","A celebration of all things tacky, garish, and bizarrely creative in the Romanian capital.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-romanian-kitsch-museum-bucharest-romania,"From sequined champagne glasses to neon crucifixes, more than 200 exhibits adorn the walls and shelves of the Romanian Kitsch Museum, a collection of poor taste, “failed art,” and overall cheesiness. The kitsch museum opened in May, 2017. It was the brainchild of Cristian Lica, a seasoned Romanian world traveler who decided that his collection of kitsch, assembled over the past 20 years, would make a perfect museum in Bucharest. The entire collection is divided into eight sections. There’s the Dracula section, naturally, which pays homage to one of the country’s most famous characters (by way of Transylvania, a historical region in what is now central Romania). There’s also religious kitsch and communist kitsch; interior design kitsch, gypsy kitsch and modern kitsch. If you’re feeling creative in a cheesy kind of way, then you’ll enjoy the Make Your Own Kitsch section, where you can craft the most tacky things that come to mind. And if you own something you believe deserves a place in the kitsch hall of fame, you can submit it for consideration in the museum’s Kitsch Art Gallery, which fills the second floor. Some of the exhibits flirt with controversy, especially in the communist, gypsy, and religious categories. A mannequin of a pregnant gypsy woman standing next to a baby plays with the stereotypical portrayal of a poor Romani woman. Orthodox clerics standing next to luxury cars poke fun at religious hypocrisy. But none of it is deliberately meant to offend. For the curator, these totems of tastelessness simply exist: they are what they are. Other artifacts encountered on this kitsch trip through Romania’s culture and history include neon Christian crosses, digitally flickering fireplaces, cushions in the shape of one-euro coins, painted clown statues, and a statue of David wearing a super bling and totally tacky gold dollar-sign medallion. And if you really want to crank up the crassness, you can even arrange to be picked up and taken to the museum in a limousine. Life doesn’t get much more kitsch than that. Update as of October 2022: The museum is closed indefinitely.  The museum is open daily from midday to 10 p.m.",kitsch collections museums and collections museums

On top of the peculiar architecture that comes with that unique history, the town also features a big landmark in the form of the one of the smallest streets in Europe, and the world. Strada Sforii—which translates roughly as “Rope Street”—was built in the 15th century to afford fire fighting brigades passage between the major thoroughfares at either end. Given its close proximity to Brașov’s main square, Piața Sfatului, and the historically significant Gothic Lutheran church Biserica Neagră (“Black Church”) found therein, Strada Sforii has gone from an urban planning hack to a popular tourist attraction. Measuring 80 meters (260 feet) long and varying in width from 111-135 centimeters (44-53 inches), Strada Sforii is the third-narrowest street in Europe, after Spreuerhofstraße in Reutlingen, Germany (recognized by Guinness as the narrowest street in the world) and Parliament Street in Exeter, England.

104,Palace of the Parliament,"Bucharest, Romania",This communist behemoth is the heaviest building in the world and a legacy of a brutal regime.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palace-of-the-parliament,"Communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu ruled Romania from 1965 until his sudden and violent death in December 1989. His oppressive regime left deep scars in all aspects of life, including urban planning and architecture. The pinnacle of communist architecture in Romania is the People’s Palace (now The Palace of Parliament), built to reflect the prosperity and grandeur of the multilateral society. The name is cruelly ironic, as people faced food shortages, blackouts, and gas cuts as two billion dollars were being poured into a massive project dedicated to its ruling class. Work on the palace began in 1984, and it has yet to be finished. There are parts where workers are still putting up wall and ceiling tiles and decorations, while other parts are already undergoing refurbishments. At its height, the site swarmed with 20,000 workers, 5,000 soldiers and 700 architects, working around the clock. Fitting for a totalitarian regime, the building holds an impressive list of world records. It’s currently the heaviest building on the planet, with 1.5 billion pounds of steel and bronze, 35 million cubic feet of marble, 7.7 million cubic feet of glass and crystal, and 32 million cubic feet of wood. It has 1,100 rooms and 2,800 chandeliers (the largest one weighs 11,000 pounds). One of the meeting halls has a podium at one end, with Ceaușescu’s armchair on it. The People’s Palace rises nine stories above the ground and also has nine levels underground. There are nuclear bunkers for thousands of people in the basement, two parking lots for trucks and buses, and, allegedly, secret tunnels leading to other government buildings in the area. To make room for such a large project, an entire neighborhood and parts of three others were razed to the ground overnight. People received notice in the morning to pack up and leave, and by noon the bulldozers arrived and started demolishing everything in sight. A total of 40,000 people were displaced and 9,000 houses were demolished. Several monuments and churches were also destroyed, including a monastery dating back to 1564.  The palace is open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.",communist architecture communism palaces

It is nestled near Tusnad in the Natural Reserve of Mohos, Harghita County. Palynology studies have concluded that this lake, Lake Saint Anne as it is known outside of Romania, was created somewhere between 9,800 and 8,800 years ago. Then, it was just an area of peat bog with a shallow lake in the center. Today, the lake measures more than 220,000 square meters even though the maximum depth is just 6.4 meters, with sediment thickness adding another four meters. The size that Lake Saint Anne has grown to is remarkable, especially when you consider that it is supplied exclusively by rainwater and precipitation in the area. Because of this, though, the degree of mineralization of the water is very low; the water held inside of this crater lake is almost as pure as distilled water one can buy in a store. Also, no animal that can survive in the oxygen-filled waters of Lake Saint Anne has ever been transported in or found its way inside of the crater lake, leaving it entirely devoid of life. Today, visitors to Lake Saint Anne know if they are going to have a clear day for hiking and picnicking based on two cracks that formed in the mountains long ago. Because the mountain is still experiencing some post-volcanic activity, it is sensitive to any change in air pressure. When the pressure decreases, gases such as sulfur and carbon dioxide rise to the surface. If visitors they smell rotten eggs, it’s clear that a storm is forming overhead.

For the last sixty years, the house has been a museum of pharmacy, holding within some of the most fascinating artifacts from a time when the lines between medicine and alchemy were still quite blurred. This enthralling museum has one of the oldest, most unusual and intriguing collections of (al)chemical artifacts and tools in Transylvania, if not the whole of Eastern Europe, comprised of roughly 3,000 pieces. Known as the Hintz House, due to the legendary family of apothecaries who took over the pharmacy in 1863 and ran it until the communist take-over of 1949, the museum has a large collection of preserved specimens of substances — both organic and mineral — which apothecaries would use to treat illnesses hundreds of years ago. The purposes of these substances (such as the famous “mummy dust” for example) are explained in little notes, and the tour guide is very knowledgeable in addition. The museum also preserves the apothecary’s secret crucible room, a small underground space where most poultices and healing recipes were concocted by the head apothecary and his apprentice with utmost secrecy. Not only does the museum provide a glimpse into the veiled world of medieval and renaissance era apothecaries, it also showcases tomes and ledgers that give the visitor a clearer picture of what everyday society was like during that time. Update May 2019: It is closed and under construction.  The museum is in the center of Cluj-Napoca, right as King Ferdinand Street begins, on the corner. It's right across the intersection from the Hotel Melody Central, an easy-to-recognize landmark due to the large neon sign adorning its facade.

107,Sibiu's Houses with Eyes,"Sibiu, Romania",Something's watching you.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sibius-houses-with-eyes,"While walking around Sibiu, Romania, you’ll start to notice something a bit odd. You may even get the sense that someone—or something—is watching you. While you gaze at the city’s architecture, you’ll start to realize the houses are staring back. Many of the houses on the south and east sides of the city look as though they have eyes peering from their roofs. These cartoonish features give the impression that the buildings (much like Sibiu’s notorious party crowd) never sleep. Though the eyes may look like some sort of sinister Big Brother surveillance program, they’re actually just oddly shaped windows. Houses use them as a ventilation system for their attics, which were used to store products needing a dry environment. Most of the “eyes” were built between the 15th and 19th centuries. Despite their practical purposes, some like to claim these peepers were built to instill fear in people, letting them know they were always being watched and to behave accordingly. When dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu was in power, this architectural detail felt extra disturbing to the citizens. It wasn’t enough that phones were being tapped, people were being questioned, and families were blacklisted. It’s as if the houses were watching their every move, too. And now, though Ceauşescu is long gone, the eyes are still there, as they have been for centuries. Unblinking, unmoving, and always observing.

Called Peștera Urșilor in Romanian, the Cave is located in the Apuseni Mountains, in the borderlands of Chişcău Village. The cave system was first discovered in 1975 when exploratory mining blasting revealed the caverns. They were then explored by a group of scientists known as Speodava who found a massive amount of bones that once belonged to ancient, extinct cave bears that hadn’t walked the Earth for over 27,000 years. By 1980, the Bears’ Cave was opened to the public, quickly becoming the most popular attraction in the area. The cave offers four galleries to explore including the Scientific Gallery and the Candles Gallery. The Bones Gallery may be the most impressive and iconic of the four however, as this cavern contains a walk way that circle the full skeleton of a cave bear that is still embedded in the stone floor. In addition to the bear remains, the cave itself is a wonderland of impressive geologic forms. That alone would usually be enough to make for a must-see cave, but along with the skeletons this one has it all. One might say that this cave is more bear bones than bare bones.

Though its name, Biserica Neagră (the Black Church) may seem dark and foreboding, the building is nothing to fear. Step inside, and you’ll find a magnificent trove of cultural treasures nested within the enormous space. Construction on the impressive Gothic church began in the 14th century. It survived the Protestant Reformation largely unscathed, but sadly wasn’t as lucky during the Great Turkish War of the 1680s. During this conflict, a nasty fire set the building ablaze. Flames licked the walls and devoured a large chunk of the interior. It took roughly a century for workers to repair and restore the grand structure. The scorched, soot-covered walls earned the church its name. Now nearly good as new, the church houses a 4,000-pipe organ from the 19th century, which still fills the air with a reverberating chorus of musical delights during weekly concerts. Its walls also hold a massive collection of Anatolian rugs that were collected between the 15th and 17th centuries. The outside of the church is just as intriguing as the interior. Its six-ton bell is the largest in all of Romania. Strangely, the statues adorning the church’s exterior were made with friable grit, which slowly deteriorates over time. One particularly odd, though well-preserved, statue has been given a life of its own, thanks to local lore. According to some, it honors a young boy who annoyed the cathedral’s builders. Legend says he was pushed off the roof then had his corpse stuffed and encased within one of the walls.",fires christianity medieval religion churches sacred spaces history architecture

The Brașov sign is easily spotted. Located at the top of mount Tâmpa, it can be viewed from all over the old town, and can be reached by a cable car which leaves from Casa Pădurarului at the base of the mountain. From here it is a short five-minute walk along a rough path to get right behind the giant letters. The Râșnov sign by contrast is harder to reach as it is located right in front of the old citadel yet it is similarly visible from all over the city. Even excluding the multitude of vampire movies that are usually associated with Transylvania, the area has been home to number of big-budget American film shoots. For instance, the 2003 epic Cold Mountain was shot in surrounding fields and farmland in the Carpathian Mountains. The similarly named towns may not have much of a film industry unto themselves, but Hollywood’s rampant use of the Transylvanian scenery easily justifies the towns’ devotional signage homages.",signs film locations film

Shortly after, many Romanians began throwing out items that were used in the household during the Communist era. It was out with the old, in with the new. Twenty-five years later, starting with a vinyl collection of old Romanian LPs and aided by word of mouth, a museum began to take shape. Located close to the Timișoara city center, the Museum of the Communist Consumer is a collection of items that Romanians could buy during the “golden age” (as it was called by communist propaganda) that showcases a way of life that was present in every household of Communist Romania. The unique museum is set up like a typical apartment, where visitors can explore armoires, drawers and shelves to discover all sorts of items that were in use in Communist Romania, ranging from old TV and radio sets to kitchen amenities, bicycles and toys, school supplies and many more. For some visitors, the memorabilia serves as a way to learn about a way of living that no longer exists. Others will remember and recognize items that used to be in their own homes. The museum is in an old house located close to the Nicolae Balcescu Square, reachable by tram (6 , 7 , 8 or 10) or by bus (E8). The street's former name is Zoe (changed recently to Laszlo Szekely).The entrance is done through the upstairs bar called Scârţ Loc Lejer, where you can relax and have a taste of Romanian beer, sweets and hospitality.Donations are still accepted, so the museum is constantly changing and has much evolved since it's opening, in early 2015.

Built in 1895 by King Carol I, it had eight wings, 308 cells, a massive defense wall, and seven guard towers. Five wings had cells with windows, and three wings had cells with no natural light whatsoever—these were reserved for those sentenced to more severe punishments. In the 1930s and ‘40s, fascists and communists were jailed within the complex alongside petty criminals. A legend says that while in prison, communists used to write articles on toilet paper, swing them on a wire from one cell to the other, and smuggle them out for a weekly leaflet that would then be distributed among factory and railroad workers. Among the future communist leaders serving sentences within the prison were Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Nicolae Ceaușescu. Both would eventually rule Romania: Gheorghiu-Dej from 1948 through 1965 and Ceaușescu 1965 through 1989. After World War II, Gheorghiu-Dej transformed the prison into a museum for propaganda reasons, using it to show the entire nation where the bourgeois regime used to lock up those who fought for the rights of proletarians. A miniature of the compound was placed in the first hall at the entrance, statues of Dej and later of Ceaușescu were on exhibition, and the cell of the latter could be seen preserved as it had appeared 30 years before. Buses full of children, teenagers, workers, and soldiers arrived here every day on a continuous pilgrimage. This prison was chosen because of the scenery and imposing structure, and Ceaușescu had only been there for petty crime in his youth, awaiting his penalty before he was sent away. After communism fell in 1989, the museum was abandoned and left to decay. Most of the roof has collapsed, there are no windows, and in some parts, water leaks have begun to chip away at floors and walls. The miniature of the compound and the statues have been smashed beyond recognition, probably as payback after 45 years of poverty and terror. Plans to sell the old prison to a real estate developer or a hotel operator have failed, and the fate of the building is now uncertain.  The building is not officially open for tours and it is dangerous to visit without proper protective equipment, so you must stick to admiring it from the outside.",prisons abandoned ruins museums

Salt mining here dates back to Dacian times, a practice later exploited by the Romans. In the 1500s, the salt mine came under the control of Transylvanian Hungarians known as Szeklers (though they may have been Avars), who mined the salt three times a year, tax-free. In the 1960s, the mine started to be used for therapeutic purposes, and today thousands of people come to undergo “speleotherapy” or salt therapy. Speleotherapy and the breathing in of salty air have been shown in clinical trials to have positive results, at least for children with bronchiolitis. Because the speleotherapy of the mine is such a big draw, and people stay in the mine for days or weeks at a time, numerous amenities have been set up here, such as a swimming pool, hot tubs, billiard tables, libraries, cafes, a restaurant, a wine gallery, salt spas, and an underground garden area for kids. The mines even have several salt museums, with salt sculptures exhibited.

The pharmacy was known as La Ursul Negru (The Black Bear), and likely looked nothing like the beautifully reconstructed pharmacy on display today. The wooden counters and shelves are not from Romania, but an 18th century Viennese Apoteka (Pharmacy). Still, the museum provides an intricate example of what an 18th-century Eastern European pharmacy would have looked like. The rows of ceramic and wooden jars, and walls of carefully labeled drawers for herbs may not be entirely Romanian, but a back room dedicated to Homeopathy is. The room is in honor of Samuel Hahnemann, the father of homeopathy. Hahnemann is believed to have come up with many of the early ideas that lead to homeopathy in Sibiu, Romania, and some of his original plans and instruments are on display. A middle room displays a gorgeous chemist’s laboratory, with brass scales, glass retorts and jars, and iron presses ranging from the 15-19th century. The museum’s collection comes from old chemist shops, medical institutions, and individuals. They had a lot to choose from, as Sibiu once had more chemists than any other town in Transylvania.

It was founded in the 12th century by Saxon settlers brought in by the King of Hungary, Geza II. Set on top a hill, the settlement was surrounded by a defense wall that was gradually upgraded with 14 towers. Each of these towers was built, manned, and maintained by the city’s 14 guilds, which included groups like the Blacksmiths, Butchers, Weavers, Rope Makers, Leather Tanners, and Tailors guilds, in exchange for commercial privileges. The towers were all designed to act as their own individual fortresses. Amazingly, nine of the towers are still in place. The most impressive, the Clock Tower, was built in the 14th century and still guards the main entrance into the city. Two wooden drummers emerge every 15 minutes to tell the time and each hour the large bell rings. Today, the stalwart structure serves as a history museum. Its viewing balcony offers an impressive vista of the entire city. While in Sighișoara, be sure to do more than just gaze at its mighty towers. The city holds old buildings, like the house where Vlad Țepeș (aka “The Impaler”) was born in 1431, two Gothic churches, and the residence of a blacksmith that survived the devastating fire of 1676 thanks to the water well inside the house. On the other side of the hill, just outside the city walls, you can explore the old cemetery, which houses stunning tombstones of important people from the history of Sighișoara.

Around the year 1100, atop a hill in the village, Szekely inhabitants built a small chapel. As the Saxons started to take over the area in the latter half of the century, they used the chapel as the foundation for their own Romanesque church, adding a wooden seat gallery. That church was torn down by Tartars in the mid-13th century, and since the danger of invasion by Tartars and Ottomans did not go away after the church was rebuilt, it was gradually expanded and fortified to help keep those invaders out. This was common with smaller villages in the region, which did not have other means of protection. The first outer walls were 23 feet high, allowing people to move safely around the church grounds during wartime. Towers and bastions were added in the 14th century, and a second layer of walls a few hundred years later. During times of peace in later centuries, rooms and corridors built as fortifications were used for storage or as classrooms. Today there is a museum with artifacts from throughout the town’s history. Notable features in the church include the much-loved painting The Blessing of the Children by J. Paukratz, added above the altar in the 19th century, and the scalloped capital atop one of the pillars near the altar, the only one of its kind in Transylvania.

A century, however, is an eternity in the world of technology, so today the museum is less a carnival of scientific wonders and more a science history museum, as well as a fascinating look at the bleeding edge of technology in the first half of the 20th century. Dimitrie Leonida was a Romanian engineer who founded the country’s first electrical and mechanical engineering school in 1908, and relied on help from the school’s staff and faculty to open the Technical Museum one year later. The museum covers a wide range of topics related to engineering and the physical sciences, including 1960s nuclear power plant technology, gamma spectrometers, horse-powered oil extraction techniques, magnetic and electrical fields, chemistry, mining, telecommunications, and hydraulics. Reflecting some of the main engineering efforts of the 20th century, the museum features lots of different motorized carriages, motorbikes, and all kinds of crazy cars, from beefy antique German race cars to wacky Eastern Bloc vehicles to fabulous concept cars that never saw mass production. The Technical Museum was built in the last remaining pavilion of the 1906 Great Romanian Exhibition, which sought to highlight all that the country had to offer the world. Whether intentionally or not, the museum has partially carried on that mandate, exhibiting the work of some of Romania’s outstanding engineers.

118,Arcul de Triumf,"Bucharest, Romania",Romania's triumphal arch looks out over Bucharest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arcul-de-triumf,"A triumphal arch in the northern part of Bucharest, Romania, the Arcul de Triumf has had several iterations along Kiseleff Road since it was first hurriedly constructed out of wood in 1878 when Romania gained its independence. That first arch was erected just so that the troops could march under it on their way into the city. And then the Arcul de Triumf was rebuilt in the same site in 1922 after World War I. That second temporary structure managed to stand for about 13 years before being knocked down to make way for the current arch, which is built from a much longer-lasting material: Deva granite. Inaugurated in September 1936, the current Arcul de Triumf stands 27 meters (85 feet) high and has a rectangular base that measures 25 x 11.5 meters. Built using plans drawn up by the architect Petre Antonescu, the Arcul de Triumf was decorated by famous Romanian sculptors, including Ion Jalea and Dimitrie Paciurea. Today, the arch stands as a monument to independence and is visited by many tourists every day. Each year, military parades are held underneath the Arcul de Triumf on December 1, which marks Romania’s National Day. An internal staircase was built so that visitors could climb to the top of the arch and look out over the city. It also hosts a small museum that includes photos of the previous iterations. Bucharest is deceptively big, a great way to see the city and hear about the history that surrounds the likes of Arcul de Triumf is to take a bike tour.

119,One Wood Monastery,"Frâncești, Romania",A Romanian church built from one single oak.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/manastirea-dintr-un-lemn-francesti-valcea-county-romania,"The One Wood Monastery seems tiny. It seems absolutely miniature, and fairly unimpressive until you realize it was constructed out of the wood from just one oak tree. In the early 16th century, a monk made an interesting discovery inside a hollowed oak while walking in the Romanian countryside. To his amazement, an icon of the Virgin Mary was carved into the interior. The icon spoke to the monk, telling him to raise a church using only the wood from the icon-emblazoned oak tree. This legend has obviously stirred controversy and claims of historical inaccuracy. Another version of the story has a shepherd finding the icon and acting accordingly. Even the icon itself has been victim to strict scrutiny as to its age and origin, with some claiming that it was a creation of Constantinople era Christian artists or 4th century Greek craftsman. Others are still more inclined to believe the religious legend of the monk. Despite the holy origins of the church, it is in fact a recreation of the older building originally constructed. In the 17th century, a fire ravaged the church completely destroying the original oak building and sparing the icon. The legend persisted after the fire, and a monastery was built up around the area. Today, 50 nuns have dedicated their lives to the holy site. The icon is now housed in a stone church on the premises and is considered the most valuable of the monastery’s collections, which also include other icons and old books. 23 km away from Ramnicu Valcea, Romania",architectural oddities architecture

A car left in neutral begins to crawl uphill. A water bottle lying on the ground rolls forward. Though it may seem like some sort of spooky gravity defying magic, it’s actually a trick of the eye. It’s a gravity hill, a spot where the surrounding land makes a downward incline look like an uphill path. The simple explaination doesn’t stop folk tales though. Legend has it that a tragic event happened in Maramureș decades ago, where a bus filled with children crashed, leaving behind no survivors. The tale claims that ever since, the unsettled spirits of the children cause mischief and push cars up the hill.

By the time she was 16 she was studying at La Sorbonne in Paris. The wunderkind spoke seven languages and excelled at singing, painting, and playing the piano. She was the only child of Romanian intellectual Bogdan-Petriceicu Hasdeu. The dedicated student was working on her doctoral thesis when, just a month before she was to turn 19, she was struck by a fatal attack of tuberculosis. After her passing, her devastated father built an altar for Iulia in the family vault at the Bellu Cemetery in Bucharest. In his time of misery, he turned to spiritualism for succor. He spent years perfecting his shrine to his daughter, but it wasn’t enough. In 1894, he began building a folly house nearby in Câmpina. He designed the purely ornamental folly in the shape of a castle with Iulia’s spirit guiding him. She’d allegedly contact him in short bursts to advise him to pay special attention to, what she considered magic numbers, three and seven. The castle features three towers, three underground rooms, and each staircase is made up of seven steps. The massive entrance is flanked by stone thrones and sphinxes. Above the door is the Eye of the Providence marked with the date July 2, which apparently symbolizes his wife and daughter. After the castle was completed in 1896, Hasdeu moved his spiritualist rituals to the rooms he’d furnished for such endeavors. Many believed his memorial to Iulia was simply a front for Satanic practices. Some have claimed to have seen Iulia’s ghost roaming the property in a white dressing gown, clutching daisies. The castle has been included in Romania’s Listing of Historical Monuments since 1955, and in 1994 it was converted to a museum. Many of Iulia’s personal belongings, some original seance transcripts, pictures taken during the seances, and other items related to the family’s history are on display.

122,Cârța Monastery,"Cârța, Romania",Climbing to the top of the cathedral's bell tower offers sweeping views of these medieval ruins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/carta-monastery,"These haunting medieval ruins tower over the landscape. Though the Gothic church is a shell of its former grandeur, the architecture of this old monastery is still a sight to behold. While wandering around, it’s easy to imagine how it looked back when it was a hub for Cistercian monks. The Cistercian Order was founded in 1098 by a monk in Burgundy, a region of what’s now France. The “white monks” and their teachings spread throughout Europe. The Cistercian Order reached this region of Southern Transylvania (now part of Romania) in the 12th century. Construction on this monastery began around 1205. At first, the buildings were primarily made of wood, with one stone chapel built around 1210 or 1215. A large stone wall that stretched up to 12 feet tall wrapped around the complex. It, and some of the other stone buildings, were built in the Romanesque style during the 1230s. The Mongolian invasion in 1241 caused construction to halt abruptly, and it remained stopped until 1261. By the time construction renewed, there was a stonemasons’ shop in town and a new architect was brought in to build the massive Gothic-style church. In 1474, Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary and Croatia, disbanded the monastery and transferred its control and possessions to the Lutheran Church in Sibiu for political reasons. The complex was later abandoned in the 17th century. Though the main hall of the church had collapsed, the local German community began reusing the complex in the 18th century and installed a large pipe organ in the still-standing chapel. The grounds where the main nave stood now serve as a cemetery, and there is a small memorial for the local soldiers who died in World War I. The bell tower, built in 1495, still stands. You can climb to the top of the old structure. The stairway is narrow and dark and the steps are worn, but the view is worth the trek. The vantage point lets you grasp the sheer size of the entire monastery.  The Monastery can be visited Monday through Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for a fee of 5RON ($1.25).

123,Sighișoara Saxon Cemetery,"Sighișoara, Romania",This hauntingly beautiful cemetery outside a medieval citadel is full of winding paths and ivy-covered graves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sighisoara-saxon-cemetery,"This German cemetery looks like a fairytale graveyard. It’s old, but not crumbling, and orderly, with beautiful sculptures and winding paths. The Saxon Cemetery in Sighișoara occupies the entire west slope of the hill where the medieval citadel stands. Construction of the church on the hill started in 1345 and in 1350, the first defensive wall was built around the town. Initially, the dead were buried around the church, but as the need for space grew, the plot just outside the upper gate of the fortification was turned into a cemetery that exists to this day. As invasions ceased and the defense towers became obsolete, the Ropemakers’ Tower that guards the exit toward the cemetery was decommissioned and given to a poor family to be used as their residence. In exchange, the members of that family had to ring the bell at 7:00 a.m., noon, and 7:00 p.m. and maintain the alleys. When the Reformation came, the city’s German population plus some of the Hungarians switched to Lutheranism. The cemetery tells impressive stories of the strong belief, work ethic, and family values of the Protestants. Some of the oldest surviving Protestant tombstones are from the early 1700s and bear not only the names, but also the occupations of those buried there. You’ll spot the final resting places of stone masons, builders, weavers, tailors, blacksmiths, and more. The Saxons took great pride in their achievements and it is not uncommon to find titles “Chief of the Guild” or “Master Carpenter” added next to their occupations. Other gravestones were used to stabilize the slopes and are now unreadable, worn by rain and wind and covered in ivy and moss. The Church on the Hill holds the beautifully decorated tombstones of the most important people from the 1600s and 1700s, like mayors, friars, and wealthy guild masters. One of the most impressive monuments belongs to a wealthy industrialist born in 1860. His tombstone reveals the fact that four of his children died before reaching the age of five, probably because of an epidemic. Not much could be done about it, as there were no means to combat it at the time. If you continue to explore downhill and exit the secondary gate, you’ll find yourself on a beautiful, narrow path with trees and shrubs all around. On the left side there is the Catholic cemetery, followed further down by the Orthodox one. There, between the shrubs, lies the monument to the soldiers who fought and died in World War I, a small group of identical crosses and a tall eagle.  The cemetery can be visited for free and is open from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily.",graveyards burial places cemeteries

When the Romans conquered Dacia in 106, they destroyed its capital, Sarmizegetusa Regia, and established a new city some 40 kilometers (25 miles) away to serve as the capital of their new province. But in the 20th century, the remains of the older city were discovered in what is now Romania. Before Dacia became a province of the Roman Empire, Sarmizegetusa Regia—located in what is now Romania—served as the center of the kingdom’s religion, military and politics. The city was built on top of a 1,200-meter (4,000 foot) tall mountain hidden deep in the Carpathians, and was a core of strategic defense. Even to this day, accessing the ruins is relatively difficult. Serving as the Dacian capital for well over a century, Sarmizegetusa Regia reached its zenith during the reign of the legendary King Decebal, but Rome’s relentless assaults put an end to its prosperity. The city’s fortress, which was constructed for defense against enemies including the Roman Empire, is composed of six citadels. The walls were destroyed by the Romans after the wars and the abandoned city was left to waste. Excavations in the 20th century unearthed the fortress, sanctuaries, and remains of civilian housings along with scores of archaeological artifacts, including an enigmatic sundial known as the Andesite Sun. Many of the artifacts discovered at the site are now housed at the Deva History Museum in Deva. In 1999, the ruins were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Located among the dense forests of the beautiful Șureanu Mountains, the isolated site of Sarmizegetusa Regia is a lovely place to visit and a must-see for enthusiasts of ancient history.",empire roman temples ancient ruins

Most of the trophies are from the late 19th and early 20th century. Entire foxes hang upside down by their feet, while mounted vulture heads stare out over rows of chamois horns. The walls of the museum are entirely covered with animals. In the second room, a huge bear is mounted, batting at the air with an enormous paw. Just to his left, the mounted head of a hunting hound is snarled with equal fierceness; the dog was killed by the bear, the bear by the dog’s owner. Both were mounted, one as trophy, the other as homage. The large game room features “impressive trophies of large, Carpathian game (stag, bear, wild boar, chamois) most of them awarded at national and international contests of the period between World Wars, reflecting the exceptional value of the Romanian game.” The museum is named after a well-known personality of Sibiu in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries: Colonel August von Spiess, the Keeper of the Royal Hunting under the King Ferdinand I of Romania. Not just named for him, the museum also has a whole room dedicated to von Speiss; the memorial room is full of photographs from African safaris and Speiss’ own arms and trophies.

Built in 1966 to create hydroelectricity, it was the fifth largest dam in Europe at the time. It required 42 kilometers of tunnels, over a million hard rocks extracted from underground and nearly a million cubic meters of concrete to build, plus the loss of about 80 builders’ lives. The vast dam is itself worth a visit, and those who do will also catch a glimpse of a statue of Prometheus watching over the dam from atop Pleșa Mountain, holding a flash of lightning in his hand to symbolize electricity. The ancient Titan—who in Greek mythology stole fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to humans—looks like a modern-day superhero backdropped by the Frunţii Mountains and Ghiţu mountains that surround Lake Vidraru. There’s something hiding in these hills, too. The Vidraru dam was designed with an ingenious safety measure. To avoid nearby cities being flooded from a crack in the dam (from a bomb or otherwise), dynamite was placed strategically in the surrounding mountains. In the event that the dam breaks, the dynamite would be detonated and form a substitute dam out of the rock blasted out of the mountains.

It’s most commonly referred to as the “Potato on a Stick” or “Potato on a Skewer” monument, though some others compare the giant blob being pierced to an olive or a brain. The unusual structure was commissioned in 2004 by the Bucharest City Hall and was inaugurated on August 1, 2005. It’s part of a broader monument that honors the victims of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, in which communism was overthrown. Revolution Square features four parts of the monument. A small, paved area allows visitors to mourn and contemplate. There’s also the Wall of Remembrance, which holds a brass plate containing the names of all the victims of the violent events that occured in December 1989 that led to the arrest and execution of communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife. The Path to Triumph, an alley leading to the main pyramid, is paved with slices of oak trunks meant to symbolize strength and durability. But it’s the monument’s centerpiece that garners the most attention. The white, marble obelisk has three sides and is surrounded by several statues representing the shadows of the people who wanted freedom and democracy. The rounded, nest-like structure the pyramid skewers is meant to represent the martyrs’ sacrifices. In 2012, someone threw some red paint at the base of the “potato.” The vandalism left a red smudge that dripped down the facade, which somehow completes the symbolism of the monument. It was never erased by the authorities. The monument was heavily criticized for being a mix of incompatible artistic elements and for being too kitschy. It also cost nearly $2 million.  The memorial is located within Revolution Square. The area is open 24/7, so you can stop by whenever, though it's best to go during daylight hours. Please keep in mind that the square is meant to be a place of remembrance, so do act respectfully. The Universitate metro station is an eight-minute walk away.

Initially, the church was Catholic. The building has belonged to the Reformed Church since the 17th century, and is still used by the organization for cultural activities. About 200 graves are scattered around the church. Archaeological excavations have also revealed coins featuring an image of King László scattered around the grounds. Other excavations discovered young children buried inside the church. They were likely interred within the church’s walls because they were believed to be pure. At the end of the Second Crusade, members of the Knights Templar stopped by this church and left their marks. Etched onto a bell are several crosses, as well as two papal keys. Their visit also spawned an intriguing legend: according to local lore, a ray of sun will pass through the two round windows and illuminate a place where the knights hid a treasure. The church walls were built with bricks from Germisara, an old Roman fort near Geoagiu. Some stones from the river were also used as building materials.  You can walk by the church at any time.

After being constructed in 1316 as a Catholic church, it was converted to Lutheranism in 1545, just 28 years after Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses. Again riding the wave of popular reformist movements, the church converted again to Calvinism in 1558 as that movement began to pick up steam. Then right when it seemed like St. Michael’s Church had switched denominations too many times to keep track of, it converted again to Unitarianism in 1566 after that denomination was founded. In 1716, however, Catholicism made a comeback with the counter-reformation, reverting the church to the denomination it began with. Its history of indecision aside, St. Michael’s Church is built in a beautiful Gothic style with pillars and an organ inside. At 262 feet tall it is the second highest church in Romania, after the Black Church in Braşov. Although in the medieval era the church was adorned with colorful frescoes, the Protestants, preferring bare walls, erased them, meaning the current ones are replicas. At this point the cathedral has been Roman Catholic for more than 300 years, but who knows what might be next. Update May 2019: The church is under renovation and appears to be closed to the public.

The school of icon and mural painting that was established at this monastery in the 18th century was famous throughout the entire Balkan region. Because the Horezu Monstery was such an important center for the diffusion of cultural ideas and knowledge throughout the area, it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. “The catholicon of the monastery was built in 1690-92 and the interior decoration was completed two years later, the work of the Greek artist Constantinos, who founded the celebrated school of Horezu,” according to UNESCO’s official description of the site. “It is laid out according to the precepts of the Athonite Order around the catholicon, which is enclosed by a wall and surrounded by a series of skites.

Situated about 10 kilometers from Bucharest, Romania, Mogoșoaia Palace bears the name of Mogoș, the Romanian boyar, or member of the highest rank of the feudal Moscovian, Bulgarian, and Moldavian aristocracies, second only to ruling princes, between the 10th century and the 17th century, who owned the land. After Mogoș, the palace exchanged hands several times. After it was given to Princess Marthe Bibesco by her husband, Prince George Bibesco, it became a central meeting place for international high society and politicians. Prince George, Princess Bibesco’s husband, died on the site in 1941 and was buried on the grounds. His remains are kept under the small white church built near the palace in 1688. Elizabeth Bibesco, wife of Prince Antoine Bibesco, is also buried in the family vault as the Mogoșoaia Palace grounds.

135,Castle of Magyarózd,"Ozd, Romania","Home of the first female Hungarian poet, where her secret writing lay hidden for over a century.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-of-magyarozd,"This small castle in Magyarózd, Transylvania, dating from the Renaissance era and still standing, kept a secret for over a century. The countess who lived there between 1681 and 1704 wrote poems that no one knew about during her lifetime. When found, they proved to be of true literary value. Known as the first Hungarian female poet, Kata Szidónia Petrőczy moved to the castle in Magyarózd (or “Ozd” in Romanian; Magyarózd is the Hungarian name) after marrying a handsome but fickle general. She still loved him when he grew chilled towards her, and instead of confronting him, heartbroken, she spent her days writing poetry, seeking an explanation for her husband’s infidelities. Though she was writing and translating pious prose of the Hungarian Baroque era for public use, Petrőczy kept her poems for herself, hidden in the castle where she lived raising her five daughters. A general in the Kurutz army, fighting for independence from the Habsburg empire, her husband, Lőrincz Pekry, was often off at battle, when not chasing other women. During one of these battles, in 1709, the Austrian troops followed him to his castle. He suspected them coming and moved his family out of harm’s way, but finding it empty, the enemy set the castle on fire. Most of the castle burned down, but not all. In later years, the husband of one of his daughters, Ádám Radák, rebuilt the castle, finishing it in 1732. (Today it is also known as the Radák Pekry Castle.) It still stands on a hill in a tiny village in the Transylvanian countryside, accessible only through a dirt road, where people still drive horse-drawn carriages beside cars. During the Communist era, the state used the castle as a kindergarten, school, a cultural center, and temporary housing for teachers, but let it fall into disrepair. Today the Bonus Pastor Foundation owns the historic castle, and after a partial renovation, it is being used as a drug addiction rehabilitation center.  Getting to the castle is a bit tricky, and there is no guarantee that your GPS will work. The closest town is Ludus, in Mures county, 11 miles (18 km) away. Head to the town’s main train station and cross the railroad, taking Strada Garii. Follow it until it meets Strada Pictor Nicolae Grigorescu. Make a left unto this street. Stay on it for 10 miles (16 km), then at the fork go left towards Atintis, Bichis, and Ozd (you’ll see a sign for at least one of these villages). Continue for about 4 miles (7 km), and at the next fork, turn left again. Yes, now you will be on a narrow road, and you will feel you are in the middle of nowhere. Enjoy the scenery. For the last few miles, the road will turn to dirt. Keep going, and you will see the castle on your right.",writing writers love poetry women castles history
136,Văcărești Natural Park,"Bucharest, Romania","After sitting unused for decades, this abandoned communist infrastructure became a wildlife utopia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vacaresti-natural-park,"In the wetlands on the edge of Bucharest stands a large nature reserve surrounded by a thick concrete perimeter wall. Văcărești Natural Park stands on land that was once of the city’s neighborhoods. During the period of communist rule in Romania, the land was claimed for government use—part of President Nicolae Ceaușescu’s ambitious plan to build hydrological infrastructure that would eventually connect Bucharest to the river Danube. A reservoir was planned for Văcărești, which would be filled with water from the Argeș River. As such, a concrete dam was built to surround the lake. The few modest houses located in this area were bought by the state and demolished. The plans for development were abandoned during the Romanian Revolution in 1989. The area was slowly overtaken by nature. In 2013, scientists from the Romanian Academy surveyed the wildlife in the abandoned reservoir, and found a diverse ecosystem filled with hundreds of species of plants and animals. They began working to establish the land as a park and protected nature reserve. Văcărești Natural Park is the first urban natural park in Romania, only five kilometers away from the city center. It’s also the largest green space in Bucharest, covering 183 hectares. The park has a huge variety of birds, with at least 138 species, some rare species of plants, and mammals like foxes, weasels, and even otters.  There are multiple ways to enter. No fee!

137,Flooded Village of Bezidu Nou,"Bezidu Nou, Romania","This Romanian village may have been drowned, but it is long from forgotten.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flooded-village-of-bezidu-nou,"The spire of Bezidu Nou/Bözödújfalu’s Catholic church, long visible above the waters of Bezid reservoir, became a symbol of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu’s attempts to “systematize” rural Transylvania, in part by destroying historically Hungarian and German villages. Bezidu Nou, which had been a center of the Székely Sabbatarians, a Transylvanian religious group that converted to Judaism in the 19th Century, was inhabited predominantly by Hungarian speakers of diverse faiths. The construction of the reservoir began in 1988, although the dam had already been started in 1975, with a long interruption from 1977 to 1984. Authorities began clearing the village in 1985, and by 1994, despite Ceaușescu’s fall from power, most of the village was under water, with only 12 houses and approximately 40 residents remaining. A memorial erected in 1995 bears the names of former residents, along with plaques in Hungarian and Romanian reading: “On the floor of the lake rests Bezidu Nou. Its 180 former residents, now scattered in the world, mourn it still today. Obsequious servants of the dictatorship demolished it and flooded it, thereby destroying a historically and religiously unique community, in which families of different nationalities and faiths lived with one another, full of understanding and good peace over the centuries. Now the prayers of Roman Catholics, Unitarians, Greek Catholics, and Sabbatarians have gone silent forever. Let this place be a symbol of religious tolerance.” The iconic Catholic church which had long pierced the surface of the water gradually decayed, until its steeple finally collapsed on June 29, 2014.

138,Trajan and Wolf Statue,"Bucharest, Romania",One of the most controversial statues in Romania is an emperor with no clothes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trajan-and-wolf-statue,"The Roman emperor Trajan, who ruled between the years 98 and 117, has many accomplishments to his name. He expanded the boundaries of the empire to include the territories of Dacia, Armenia, and Mesopotamia, built public baths, rebuilt the road system, and improved the Roman port of Ostia.  Since 2012, he is also the subject of one of the most controversial statues in Romania. The respected Roman emperor stands totally and awkwardly naked on the steps of the country’s National History Museum, behind a wolf that appears to be floating just above his hands. The statue is meant to represent the birth of modern Romania, with Trajan’s conquest of Dacia (which Romania was a part of) and its subsequent inclusion in the Roman empire. The union of Dacia and Rome paved the way for Romania as it stands today. In the statue, designed by prominent Romanian artist Vasile Gorduz, Dacia is symbolized by the wolf in the ruler’s hands. But the bizarre design still raises quite a few questions, such as the wolf’s awkward floating position, and the sartorial choice to dress the emperor in his birthday suit, while the animal is wearing a scarf. These and other mysteries may never be fully solved as Gorduz died in 2008, before the statue was unveiled by Bucharest’s mayor in 2012. The statue is more hated than loved by locals, but it makes for a great photo-op, especially for people traveling with animals, who parody the structure by holding their own pets up in the same position. Update March 2018: The wolf broke its tail and was taken down in the summer of 2017 and as of October 2019 it has yet to be reconstructed.

139,Dargavs Village,"Dargavs, Russia",This ancient village and its adjoining cemetery have a beautiful history of death and remembrance.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dargavs-village-city-of-the-dead,"Reaching this mystifying destination requires a three-hour drive, taking you down a dangerous and hidden road befitting a journey to the City of the Dead. The village of Dargavs, or the City of the Dead, has an ancient cemetery where people that lived in the valley buried their loved ones along with their clothes and belongings. The valley stretches for 17 kilometers, and the cemetery contains almost 100 ancient stone crypts. Ossetians say that the cemetery helps them understand how people lived 400 years ago. Archeologists, also, are very interested in exploring the site more completely, as there have been interesting items found that have attracted some scientific attention. It is a very mysterious place with a lot of myths and legends. It was once believed that if anyone tried to get to the city they would never emerge alive. Local legends have it that in the 18th century a plague swept through Ossetia. The clans built quarantine houses for sick family members, who were provided with food but not the freedom to move about until death claimed their lives. People who did not have any remaining family members to bury them would just wait in the massive cemetery until their death. It was a very slow and painful way to go, and in the City of Death they stay. It attracts tourists from nearby as well as all over the world, although due to the difficulty in finding or traveling to the location there are not a lot of tourists at any given time. The local superstitions probably have little to do with the lack of popularity, although they do still linger. Locals bemoan the young generation’s attraction to bright cities, contending that the young are missing out on a lot. Russia has a lot of truly unique places to offer but these historic sites do not attract much attention. If, however, one spends some time in North Ossetia, they say it’s possible to feel the ancient vibes around the city and its surrounding area. Once you get to the city you will find what at first appear to be lots of little white houses but are actually stone crypts, the oldest dating back to the 16th century. In front of every crypt there is a well that was used to tell if a person made it to heaven. Visitors drop a coin into the well, and if the coin happened to hit a stone at the bottom of the well, it was said to be a good sign.  Interesting fact is that this region is a historical region of another people called Ingushetians which live today in a reduced area called ""Republic of Ingushetia"" only few miles from there. They lost more than a half of their territory since Russia came to this region in favor of Ossetians and Kazaks. Most of names of this region can be translated only from Ingush language which is often hidden by Ossetian policy of assimilation.  Each crypt belongs to one family or clan.",catacombs relics and reliquaries memento mori catacombs and crypts death
140,Bunker-42,"Moscow, Russia",Dr. Strangelove-esque tours reveal the inside a bunker once reserved for Stalin himself.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunker-42,"There’s an amazing tunnel system snaking beneath the streets of Moscow, leading to a secret cold war fortress once code named “Bunker-42.” Designed and built after the first series of nuclear tests by the Soviet Union, these tests revealed that the optimum depth for the bunker’s silo must be no higher than 165 feet beneath ground in order to survive nuclear fallout intact. The task for the builders was enormous: construct a gigantic structure beneath the city streets without damaging Moscow’s existing infrastructure of streets and communication pathways. To do so would alert the public and innumerable unknown spies to the existence of the bunker, thereby rendering the entire (read: top-secret) thing useless. Strategically located inside a hill in the Tagansky district due to its proximity to the Kremlin, allowing quick access to the bunker for Stalin and the premier tier of government officials within the USSR, Bunker-42 wasn’t completed until 1956 and was thankfully never put into use in its full capacity. Rather, it spent the subsequent three decades as an airstrike command base, communicating with aircraft transporting strategic bombers carrying nuclear weapons until the political climate began to shift in 1986. Today, the space exists as a historical monument that is equal parts museum to what life was like on the Soviet side of the Iron Curtain during the Cold War era and tour of the previously top-secret bunker itself, bringing visitors below ground to a time when the world lived on the constant brink of nuclear annihilation. A variety of tour packages are available at all hours of the day, catering to a range of ages, some of which focus more on the historical aspects of the space, while other take a nearly comic angle on the tangible threat of nuclear annihilation for all humankind.  The bunker is only accessible through a scheduled tour.

141,Izmailovo Kremlin,"Moscow, Russia","Moscow's other, lesser known kremlin is a fairytale-like cultural complex modeled after Old Russia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/izmailovo-kremlin,"As the symbol of the Russian state, the Kremlin in Moscow’s Red Square is famed and celebrated. But there is a second, less known Kremlin in the northeast part of the city. Located near the Serebryano-Vinogradny Pond, the Kremlin in the city’s Izmailovo District is an unexpected, fairytale-like cultural wonderland. Kremlin is the Russian word for citadel or fortress, and they are found in many Russian cities. But the Izmailovo Kremlin, a wooden complex completed in 2007, was not built for protection as its name suggests. It was established as a cultural center and marketplace loosely modeled after traditional Russian architecture and fairytale depictions of Old Russia. Wander about and you will spot the Romanov emblem of a crowned griffin decorating everything from buildings to fences, as well as a pink statue of Lenin which has caused some mild outrage. The colorful and bustling complex is home to several single-subject museums. One is dedicated to Russian folk art, another to bread, and yet another to vodka. It includes a wooden replica of the summer palace of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, where visitors can experience a traditional Russian meal. It is also home to the Church of St. Nicholas, named after the patron saint of crafts and trade, which at 151 feet in height is the tallest wooden church in the country. Next to the Kremlin is the Izmailovo District’s landmark open-air market, which dates back to the 17th century, when it was an avant-garde market selling original paintings, crafts, and wares. The market is now connected to the Izmailovo Kremlin by a wooden bridge. Taking the appearance of a town, with roofed stalls lining a maze of walkways, it is divided into two tiers: the Vernissage for souvenirs and traditional handicrafts, and the flea market for all else. The bazaar is attended by merchants from regions all over Russia and is a favored shopping destination for locals and tourists alike, brimming with items ranging from books, baskets, retro toys and furniture to Soviet memorabilia, fur hats, nesting dolls, and traditional artwork. Entering the Izmailovo Kremlin is like stepping back in time. Most popular during the summer and on weekends, the complex and its labyrinthine market space are equally charming during quiet, uncrowded hours. Access to the Izmailovo Kremlin and Market is easy, with Partizanskaya metro station a 10-minute walk away. Alternatively, you can use the Izmailovo station of Moscow Central Circle (MCC). The Kremlin is busy during the day and much quieter in the evening. The inner court is very well lit after dark, unlike the outside.",folklore palaces bread markets churches sacred spaces art museums architecture

The surreal swirls are caused by layers of the mineral carnallite, which can be yellow and white or even red and blue. They paint rivers of color across the walls of this abandoned salt mine, dating back millions of years to when a salty sea dried up, leaving behind the mineral deposits. The long, winding tunnels of the salt mine, whose labyrinthine passageways stretch for miles, are now mostly abandoned and only accessible with a government permit. The first photos of the Yekaterinburg mine came to light thanks to the young Russian explorer-photographer Mikhail Mishainik, who even spent whole nights down in the dance clubby dungeons. Without a flashlight, the tunnels - some of which stretch for four miles - are pitch black, and the air is filled with tiny particles of salt, giving one’s throat a permanent sense of being parched. While it’s not open to the public, perhaps you can finagle a special permit, grab a few flashlights, go down a few hundred feet, and check it out for yourself. One imagines that bringing your own psychedelics is not necessary, nor encouraged.

143,Lenin's Mausoleum,"Moscow, Russia",This building holds the embalmed remains of the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lenins-mausoleum,"Lenin’s mausoleum in Red Square offers up one of Moscow’s most macabre attractions and perhaps the most famous “modern mummy” in the world. Frozen in time, Vladimir Ilych Lenin’s embalmed body lays within a red granite and black labradorite step-pyramid. Here visitors may gaze upon it in the dark, cool of the tomb. When Vladimir Ilych Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution, died on January 21, 1924, he did not believe he was going to an afterlife. He assumed that death was the ultimate end for him. How wrong he was. In his will, Vladimir Ilych Lenin requested he be laid to rest in the ground. Instead, he was embalmed and interred in a temporary wooden cube designed by architect Alexei Shchusev. His body was on display before his funeral and, while the government said they planned to bury him, the Russian people wouldn’t have it. The Russian government allegedly received over 10,000 telegrams from the grieving public asking for the body of great leader to be preserved in some way for the generations to come. In response to the public outcry, the permanent mausoleum was commissioned in 1929 to preserve Lenin’s remains for a longer period of time. The current mausoleum was unveiled in 1930, again designed by Shchusev. Lenin’s body remained here until it was evacuated to Tymen, Siberia (along with his embalmers, who worked to keep it “fresh”), since Moscow was under the threat of Nazi invasion. In March of 1945, a Soviet operation codenamed “Object No. 1” moved Lenin’s body back from Siberia to the Moscow mausoleum. To continue the preservation of Lenin’s body, a team of special embalmers (originally Ilya Zbarsky and his son Boris Zbarsky) is dedicated to Lenin’s corpse. Unfortunately, Lenin’s 85-year-old body still has a distinctive “wax-fruit” look to it, despite being warmly lighted to make him appear more lifelike. The sarcophagus is kept at a constant temperature of 16 degrees Celsius (61° Fahrenheit) and humidity of 80 - 90 percent. Weekly, a mild bleach is used to fight discoloring fungus and mold on Lenin’s skin, and every eighteen months the corpse undergoes a chemical bath of glycerol and potassium for thirty days while the mausoleum is closed. During this time, Lenin’s clothes are washed and carefully ironed. And every three years, Lenin receives a new suit. Sadly, due to the recent economic crisis, the charity that funds Lenin’s upkeep has fallen on hard times and can’t afford to buy Lenin a new silk suit. But then, Lenin would probably cherish the knowledge of capitalism’s global meltdown more than a new suit, anyway. Lenin can be viewed for five minutes at a time in small groups under the watchful eye of guards in every corner of the room. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Communist Mummies.

If you are in Moscow, however, that couldn’t be further from the case. The Russian city’s metro stations are architectural stunners, perhaps even the most beautiful in the world. The stations are so exquisite, they look like luxurious great halls rather than entrances into an underground transportation network. Every single station is different. Colorful mosaics and stained-glass windows adorn the walls of some, while glowing chandeliers dangle from the ceilings of others. Each one is like its own mini gallery, waiting to entice the more than 2.4 billion passengers who use the subway system each year. The stations’ glamorous architecture has a deeper purpose than just aesthetic pleasure. It serves as a sort of propaganda for the socialist system. Socialist symbols like the sickle and hammer pepper the designs within some of the stations. Statues and images of socialist figures abound. Originally, the metro stations also served as showcases of socialist realist art. The above address and coordinates are for the Komsomolskaya station, but the beautiful metro stations are found all over Moscow. Some of the other most impressive are Kiyevskaya, Novoslobodskaya and Taganskaya stations. A metro ticket costs just $1 for a trip of any length. So if you don't leave the stations you can spend a whole day train hopping and being wowed by the amazing stations. Trains go every two to three minutes.

The 13 “evil” sculptures depict alcoholism, exploitation of child labor, indifference, drug addiction, prostitution, sadism, ignorance, pseudoscience, war, poverty, theft, capitol punishment, and advocating violence. Each work is incredibly detailed, showing figures closing in on the little golden boy and girl. Besides the children, the centerpiece of the work is the statue depicting indifference to these vices, and showing a man with closed eyes, plugged ears and folded arms. When the work was first constructed, there was some concern that the outstretched hands of the grotesque evils would frighten children.

Although only 50 to 55 of the games are playable, each of the machines paints a picture of life and entertainment behind the Iron Curtain. The museum has plans to expand as more machines are discovered and restored in the basement. Many of the machines have been sitting idle since the 1980s, when they were built in secret. Even though all of the machines are in Russian, the gist of the games is pretty apparent; in Tankodrome, for example, players shoot enemies with a tank.

Laika lived a bit of a rags to riches story as she began life as a homeless mongrel wandering the streets of Moscow before she was selected by the Russian space program to become the first animal to orbit the planet. Laika was chosen less for her intelligence than for her literal puppy dog eyes that the rocket scientists in Russia knew people the world over could identify with. They were not wrong, and Laika quickly gained international attention. Unfortunately this meteoric rise (pun intended) was only headed towards tragedy. The adorable little dog was trained up and fitted with a space suit before being launched into space on November 3, 1957. The craft carrying Laika, Sputnik 2, made over 2,000 revolutions of the Earth before disintegrating on reentry. According to the Russian government, Laika had perished in space either due to oxygen deprivation or a planned  euthanization. It was not until 2002 that they revealed Laika had in actuality died within hours of launch from overheating. Nonetheless, she had become a hero. Strangely, the famous mongrel did not receive her own monument in the Russian capital until 2008. The (surprisingly small) monument that now stands near a military research station is shaped like an abstract rocket that morphs into a hand, cradling Laika towards the stars.

Established by philanthropist Ildar Khanov in 1992, the site is not actually a chapel in the traditional sense but is instead a center meant to stand as a symbol of religious unity. Khanov was an active proponent of rehabilitation services and, having overseen a few in his lifetime, built the center with the help of patients he met through his work. The exterior of the Temple looks almost like something out of a Disneyland Small World display, with a Greek Orthodox dome here and a Russian minaret there. There are influences culled from Jewish synagogues and Islamic mosques, and a number of spires and bells. All said the Temple incorporates architectural influences from 16 separate religions in a bright cacophony of devotion. Khanov and his assistants lived at the site, working continually on the construction until Khanov’s death in 2013. Today the Temple is still not freely open to the public but Khanov’s associates still live on site and continue his work on the center.  You can reach the temple from Kazan by bus number 2 (leaves from railway station). Part of the building has been recently damaged by fire, but some rooms of the complex are open to visit.

150,Rasputin Museum at Yusupov Palace,"Saint Petersburg, Russia",Palace where the nearly un-killable Rasputin was murdered.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rasputin-museum-at-yusupov-palace,"“I stood watching him drink, expecting any moment to see him collapse. But he continued slowly to sip his wine like a connoisseur. His face did not change, only from time to time he put his hand to his throat as though he had some difficulty in swallowing. He rose and took a few steps. When I asked him what was the matter, he answered: ‘Why, nothing, just a tickling in my throat. The Madeira’s good,’ he remarked; ‘give me some more.’” - Prince Felix Yusupov, recalling the night he murdered Rasputin. In December 1916 at this palatial home in St. Petersburg, the young Prince Yusupov, heir to the greatest fortune in Russia and married to a cousin of the Romanov imperial family, spent a frustrating and probably terrifying night trying desperately to kill the nearly un-killable Grigory Rasputin. Rasputin was a Siberian religious mystic who had become attached to the family of Tsar Nicholas II as a healer to the tsar’s hemophiliac young son and heir, Alexei. Rasputin’s particularly close relationship with the Tsarina Alexandra, coupled with his eccentric appearance and reputation for lewd and lascivious behavior in public, fueled scandalous rumors. As World War I dragged on, the country and government teetered on the brink of collapse. To make matters worse, it appeared that the tsar – already in trouble for botched and brutal responses to internal turmoil, and general incompetency on the battlefield – was taking advice from Rasputin. By the end of 1916 a group of nobles led by Prince Yusupov decided to take matters into their own hands. Yusupov, along with conspirators Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and politician Vladimir Purishkevich, invited Rasputin to Moika Palace on the pretense of meeting his lovely young wife Irena, who was conveniently out of town. Once at the palace, Rasputin was left in a room laid out with a spread of cyanide-laced baked treats, tea, and wine. The conspirators were relieved to see Rasputin down several glasses of the poisoned wine. They became increasingly concerned, however, when the poison seemed to have no effect on the man. Legend has it that, in the end, it took poison, three bullets, a stabbing, a terrible beating, and a final drop into the icy Malaya Nevka River to kill Rasputin. However, his autopsy showed that his death was ultimately caused from the shootings. Yusupov and his conspirators never faced charges for the murder that so many knew they had committed, but just three months later the February Revolution forced the abdication of Nicholas II, and Yusupov fled the country. He later published several (sometimes conflicting) memoirs detailing the attempted murder and death of Rasputin, including a book titled “Lost Splendor.” Rasputin’s surviving daughter Maria unsuccessfully attempted to sue Yusupov and Pavlovich for damages related to the murder, but her claim, filed in Paris, was dismissed. Over the years the Moika Palace has served as an educational center, and is now a cultural museum; it is notable for having survived the Revolution and Soviet years relatively intact. In the basement room where the Mad Monk was murdered, wax figures recreate his final moments. A visit to the room is included in the afternoon tours. The rest of the building is a showpiece in itself, including a rococo theater and many elegantly appointed rooms. Rasputin’s body, fetched from the river, was originally buried on the ground of Alexander Palace, but was removed and cremated in the February 1917 uprising. Legend holds that when the flames touched his corpse, Rasputin sat upright on the pyre.  NOTE: If you show up at the palace and just buy a ticket, you will NOT get a ticket to the Rasputin exhibit. You will get a ticket to the palace interiors, which are lovely, and totally worth visiting. But if it's Rasputin you're after, and you don't speak Russian: go INSIDE (not the ticket booth outside) and just keep repeating 'Rasputin' like a simpleton until someone takes you money, hands you a ticket, and points you down the right hallway. There is a guided tour to the ""Rasputin rooms"" available on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday at 5pm from the lady who distributes audio guides inside the museum. It is 350 rubles as of Sept 2017. Metro: Sennaya Ploshchad.",murder memento mori eccentric homes homes collections architectural oddities museums and collections museums architecture

Contained therein are two large churches—the 22-dome Church of the Transfiguration and the nine-dome Church of the Intercession—and an octagonal bell-tower built exclusively from wood in an architectural style once common throughout northern Russia and parts of Scandinavia. At over 120 feet tall, the Church of the Transfiguration stands out most impressively, and boasts a nave filled with iconography of saints from the orthodox faith. Used in exclusively in the summer when far-flung groups of the devout would gather at Kizhi’s pogost, the relatively simpler Church of the Intercession accommodated the smaller group of disciples whose numbers would dwindle in wintertime. Experts have dated the construction of the buildings themselves to 1713-1714, though the names of the workers remain unknown. A local legend tells of Kizhi’s main builder having used a single axe for the duration, only to cast it into Onega’s waters upon finishing and proclaim, “There was not and will be not another one to match it.” While typical of medieval and post-medieval orthodox settlements of the period, coming across such buildings today is anything but. Set against a landscape of big skies reflected in tranquil lake waters, or winters whose snows leave the belled domes as the lone sign of life for miles, Kizhi comes across as otherworldly. In 1990, the Kizhi pogost was included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites and in 1993 listed as a Russian Cultural Heritage site, where visitors are permitted to explore the structures in an open-air museum dedicated to the unique history, architecture, and ethnography of the region.",churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture

The Church of Andrew the Apostle is a Russian Orthodox Church designed by Russian architect Andrei Rotinov, and was modeled on the famous Church of the Ascension at Kolomenskoye, a former royal estate in Moscow. Although there are no regularly scheduled ceremonies or masses at the beautiful, idyllic little chapel, it is available by appointment for baptisms and weddings. The island is currently reachable by a bridge. There are numerous references to the church being in the Guinness Book of World Records for being “the world’s only church built on a tiny island,” but these claims have proven difficult to confirm.

153,Golosov Ravine,"Moscow, Russia",Legends of time travel and magical woodland creatures bolster the natural charm of this verdant sanctuary in the midst of Moscow.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golosov-ravine,"Feeding into the Moscow River, Golosov Ravine cleaves Kolomenskoye Park in two. Once a royal estate and now a public wilderness covering an area 15% larger than Central Park, Kolomenskoye Park is an inviting place for a stroll. The ravine at its heart, however — and the tales surrounding it — add an air of mystical intrigue to an otherwise pedestrian excursion. The earliest tale of mystery regarding Golosov Ravine dates back to 1621, when a Tatar cavalry detachment turned up at the walls of the Tsar’s palace. They were lost and disoriented, claiming to be part of the army of a Crimean khan that had attacked Moscow in 1571. Sensing defeat and wanting to avoid capture, they retreated into Golosov Ravine where they were quickly enveloped in a thick green mist. Spending what seemed like only a few minutes finding their way through the fog, they emerged to find that 50 years had passed. They reportedly carried outdated equipment, and an inquiry formed by the Tsar found that the men “probably told the truth.” Time travel: confirmed. This wasn’t the only reported incident of time-warping mist descending on Golosov Ravine. In the 19th century, two local fellows had a big night out at a neighboring village and decided to take a shortcut through the ravine on their way home. They finally turned up again 20 years later, telling a tale of finding themselves trapped in a dense fog at the bottom of a ravine, where they met large, hairy, manlike creatures who managed to put them back on the right path via hand signals. However, they were shocked to find that two decades had passed, and that their wives and children did not recognize them. The incident was reported to the police who conducted an investigation, during which one of the men dissolved into the fog and never returned — or rather hasn’t…yet. Time travel: double confirmed. Large hairy man-creatures figure prominently into the legends of Golosov Ravine and most likely represent the leshy, a sort of bigfoot from Slavic mythology who is more man than ape and more woodland spirit than mortal creature. In 1926, a policeman reported seeing a “hairy wild man” over two meters tall in Golosov Ravine. The resulting investigation into the cop’s claims led to the remarkable claim in an official Moscow newspaper that a band of Young Pioneers (think Soviet Boy Scouts) had captured a leshy. An etymological case has been made that Golosov Ravine was once the site of a shrine to Veles, the Slavic trickster god of earth, waters, woods, magic, and the underworld. While this theory has not been confirmed, it suggests some context for the trickery-laden sylvan legends associated with the place. Golosov Ravine is the site of several springs considered sacred in Russian Orthodox, neopagan, and new age traditions, and contains a neopagan sacred stone shrine consisting of two five-ton rocks called Diviy (radiating “female energy”) and Gus (radiating “male energy”). Today, visitors to Golosov Ravine can not only go for a wander but also venerate these rocks, meditate and anoint themselves in spring water — comfortable in the knowledge that there have been no recent reports of mist-induced time travel or giant hairy man-creatures.",russia ghost stories mythology legends parks
154,The Amber Room,"Pushkin, Russia","An 18th century wonder of the world, lost in WWII, re-created at the Catherine Palace.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amber-room-catherine-palace,"One of history’s great lost treasures, the spectacular Baroque Amber Room once dazzled visitors to the czar’s Winter House in St. Petersburg, where more than six tons of amber were arranged against mirrors and gold leaf into an enormous, golden gallery. For most of history, the area formerly known as Prussia was the world’s most significant producer of amber, and it is still associated with the area today. The golden-colored fossilized tree sap can actually be found in locations all around the world, but has been famed and traded in Eastern Europe since at least Roman times. Designed between 1701-1711, the original Amber Room was first installed in Berlin, then given as a gift to Peter the Great, moved to Russia and expanded until it covered an estimated 180 square feet. In 1755 it was again moved, this time to the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, near St. Petersburg. During WWII, desperate officials at the Catherine Palace hid the national treasure behind wallpaper, in an attempt to stave off the art-crazed looters of the incoming Nazi army. It was, however, all for naught and the Nazis promptly made off with crates full of amber, and brought it back to Germany where it was triumphantly exhibited at Königsberg Castle. That is, it was triumphantly exhibited until they too felt the other shoe drop, and this time officials ripped out the magnificent panels and hid them away…somewhere. Since the end of WWII, historians, art lovers, and treasure hunters alike have sought the lost Amber Room, looking in silver mines and shallow waters, investigating stories of shipwrecks in the Baltic Sea and secret caves in the German countryside. It has never been found. Most experts today agree that the room is most likely gone forever, lost in the fires that consumed Königsberg Castle after the fall of Nazi Germany. The site where the Königsberg Castle once stood is now covered by a massive and strange building known as the “House of Soviets”, built in 1960, but incomplete and empty to this day. The space under the property has never been thoroughly investigated, so some mystery remains. In the meantime, reconstruction efforts began in 1979 at the Catherine Palace, but it was not until 2003 that the new version was revealed. Based on old depictions and photographs, the new Amber Room is believed to hone more closely to the original installation as it would have been seen in Berlin.",geological oddities collections geology architectural oddities architecture
155,The Irkutsk Babr,"Irkutsk, Russia",Thanks to a spelling mistake this bizarre beaver-tiger hybrid became the symbol of a Siberian town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-irkutsk-babr-irkutsk-russia,"A strange creature lurks within one of Siberia’s biggest cities. The bizarre beast looks like the ludicrous lovechild of a fierce feline and an oversized rodent. It could both pounce on its prey with classic cat-like prowess or thwack it on the head with its flat tail. The symbol of Irkutsk, Russia, is a mythological monster known as the babr. When the city first created its coat of arms in the 1600s, it used “babr,” an old local word, to describe a Siberian tiger. Sadly, as the years went on, tigers became extirpated and the chosen word fell out of fashion. In the late 19th century, when officials in Saint Petersburg were tasked with redrawing the city’s coat of arms, they were baffled by the strange, foreign-looking word. Thinking someone had accidentally misspelled bobr (beaver), they took it upon themselves to concoct an entirely new creature. After years of confusion and contention, the tiger gained a broad, flat tail and strangely webbed paws. It wears a confused look on its face as if it, too, is befuddled by its unconventional anatomy. But true to tradition, it still clutches a sable in its mouth, which represents the region’s role in the medieval Siberian sable fur trade. The symbol was outlawed during the Soviet era, but it has been restored in modern times, to the delight of locals. Now, there are many depictions of the babr throughout Irkutsk. One of the best is the massive statue in the historical 130th Quarter of the city.",tigers mistakes fantasy monsters cities statues animals

Everything from the encephalitis-swollen skulls to the specimen tumors was documented meticulously by the Tsar, who ordered the creation of this first state museum in 1714. Tourists might be motivated by morbid interest, but the collection was never intended to be a freak show. As part of Peter’s broader push to modernize Russia, the collection was started in an attempt to reduce superstition. It was hoped that cataloging malformed infants and debilitating diseases as quirks of nature would quell superstitious beliefs that blamed misfortune on demons and monsters. Peter issued an edict that the bodies of deformed infants should be relinquished to the collection. In 1716, Peter the Great visited the Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch, and purchase his entire collection. which included more than 2,000 preparations on embryology and human anatomy, more than 1,000 specimens of small mammals, reptiles, and insects, 259 preserved birds, and a other samples of butterflies, sea animals, shells, and dried plants. The same year, he also acquired the collection of Albert Seba, which included plant and animal specimens from South America as well as artwork from Japan, China, and across South America.",medical museums natural history museums and collections

Fittingly, the locals have taken to calling the building the “House with Animals,” as its terracotta bas-relief is crammed with a collection of curious creatures. Against the backdrop of soft blue-green paint, the white figures look as though they belong in a gallery rather than on the streets of Moscow, and they’re sure to stop any passerby. The team of artists behind the facade based the beings in their imaginative herd on a relief housed within a medieval cathedral in Vladimir. However, rather than strictly mimicking the older artwork, they added a 20th-century Art Nouveau twist and made the animals look larger and more grotesque. When the house was built in the early 1900s, it was intended accommodate parishioners from the church that helped fund its construction. After World War II the building was expanded, and two more floors were added. Unfortunately, the additions destroyed part of its bas-relief. Now the building houses various companies and offices. The terracotta creatures that did survive are listed as objects of cultural heritage. The closest metro station is Chistye Prudy.",art nouveau monsters animals art architecture

But the part of Fort Zverev that feels truly nightmarish lies in the basement area, where in the 1970s, a fire erupted. However this wasn’t just any fire. In this basement they stored a Russian alternative to napalm, and when it caught fire it reached temperatures of over 2000С, so hot in fact, that it literally melted the brick above it. In doing so it created a sort of artificial cave of red brick stalactites dripping down from above. Today the fort, and its cave of dripping brick stalactites are still there, slowly falling back into the Russian countryside.  The Northern Forts are all near Kronstadt. Go to the subway station ""Chernaja Rechka"" (Black River) and take a minibus to Kronstadt and go forward. The way to Kronsdatd is through the dike.

159,Oymyakon,"Oymyakonsky District, Russia",The villagers of the coldest inhabited place on Earth adjust to unique challenges presented by day-to-day living.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oymyakon-arctic-circle,"Deep in Siberia, the village of Oymyakon holds the distinction of being the coldest permanently inhabited place on Earth. Located just a few hundred miles from the Arctic Circle and reaching record lows of –96.16 degrees Fahrenheit (–71.2 degrees Celsius), one is forced to ponder not only why, but also how the villagers of this remotest of remote locations survive. With a day that varies from three hours in the winter to 21 hours in the summer and permanently frozen ground due to the extreme subarctic climate, the roughly 500 residents of Oymyakon are mostly unable to grow crops, therefore their diet basically consists of reindeer and horse meat. While spoiled kids to the south get out of school for snow days, the children of Oymyakon are stuck in class unless the temperature falls below –52 degrees Celsius (–61.6 degrees Fahrenheit). If you were to go outside naked on an average day, it would take approximately one minute for you to freeze to death. Besides the obvious issues of remoteness, the cold itself forces this village to be a simple place with few conveniences. Cars are hard to start with frozen axle grease and fuel tanks, unused pipes can freeze within five hours, and batteries lose life at an alarming speed. Pen ink freezes, anything less than fur fails at keeping the chill off, and electronics are all but useless. Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges facing these rugged people existing within “Stalin’s Death Ring” is the burial of their dead. With the ground in a state of permafrost, it takes several days to dig a grave, a strenuous task of lighting a bonfire for a few hours, then pushing the coals aside to dig a few inches, then starting another fire, and so on and so forth, until the hole is big enough to hold a coffin. While its appeal may be mostly due to the novelty of being in such a bizarre climate—there is very little to do in Oymyakon—it has a relatively successful tourism market. Area-specific activities such as reindeer hunts, ice fishing and the juxtaposition of enjoying the hot springs when the temperatures are in the minus-fifties are available to those who would like to experience this opposite of a tropical vacation spot. Most tourists visit on adventure tours which also take in nearby sights such as the Lena Pillars, gulag prisons, or the village of Tomtor, which hosts an annual Pole of Cold festival featuring Yakut and Evenk culture and cuisine.  Oymyakon has no hotels or restaurants, overnight visitors must arrange homestays with local residents.",holidays with a twist 2022 snow martian landscapes cultures and civilizations festivals intriguing environs ecosystems

Dozens of trees in the Dancing Forest of Russia have trunks that are contorted into rings, spirals, and other loops and squiggles, and the reason for this mysterious malformation is not known. The trees were planted in the early 1960s to stabilize the dune sand, but the unstable sand is one explanation people posit for the trees seeming so unstable themselves. Locals call the crooked wood the Drunken Forest. Studies have been done to try to determine the exact cause, though results are inconclusive. The leading scientific theory is that pine shoot moth caterpillars damaged the pine shoot’s apical buds at an early age causing them to start out growing at an odd angle, from their lateral buds. Since plants naturally grow toward the sun, they eventually corrected themselves and started growing up again, but with their new deformities intact. Some blame strong winds, others manipulation by humans. The supernatural-inclined have suggested that the forest is in a place where positive and negative energies clash and that these forces have manipulated the shapes of the trees. Some say that the trees willfully follow the movements of the dune sands. One local legend says the dancing trees twist and bend because centuries ago, on that very spot, trees were made to dance in order to prove the power of the Christian God. Superstition fuels many of the theories, and has also made the Dancing Forest a popular source of hope: Climbing through one of the rings has been said to add a year to a person’s life or earn that person a granted wish.",fantasy dancing forests trees natural wonders ecosystems plants nature

From the earliest roots of the drink to the evolution of its production and consumption, the museum displays, bottles, stoppers, ephemera, and other displays to explain the importance of vodka to the Russian identity. There are rows and rows of empty bottles in all manner of shapes from human figures to machine guns and an extensive collection of traditional short vodka glasses most often used to drink vodka straight as opposed to using it as a mixer (which in itself is a concept probably better not discussed in the museum). The whimsical collection of stoppers on display are also of note, shaped like heads, animals, and mythical creatures. Informational displays explain vodka’s creation and history using wax figures to tell of its Russian origin and later the Russian government’s long standing hand in national vodka production including regulating who could produce the drink and developing a national standard of quality for the drink. Guests who take a tour of the Russian Vodka Museum need not fear that their exploration of vodka’s history be a dry experience as each tour is completed with a vodka tasting where guests can sample some real Russian vodka.

163,Star City,"Shchyolkovo, Russia",Secret Soviet city once home to Russian cosmonauts and space training facilities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/star-city,"Russia’s Star City is so named not because it is home to movie stars or pop stars, but to cosmonauts, the heroes of the Soviet and Russian space programs. Today Star City is a sort of space explorer’s utopia, where cosmonauts of the past and present have lived with their families since Yuri Gagarin became the first human to visit space in 1961. Formerly a secret Air Force facility, Star City was highly guarded even by Soviet standards. Not listed on any Soviet-era maps, the closed urban-type settlement is hidden in the woods some twenty miles northeast of Moscow. As the Soviet space program developed, the need for a cosmonaut training center became evident and so Star City was born. And with the arrival of prospective cosmonauts and their families, the military facility became a legitimate city, at least by rural standards. A post office, movie theater, railway station, and a couple of schools are all within the confines of Star City. The site even captured the imagination of sophisticated city-dwellers with rumors of its impressive selection of shops. In the 1990s, however, the curtain of secrecy over Star City was lifted and the site was opened to the public. For the first time, visitors could catch a glimpse of the tank where cosmonauts practice their space walks under water, or the gigantic centrifuge where the soon-to-be spacemen are swung around at dizzying speeds, experiencing forces eight times the force of gravity in the process. Today, a handful of companies offer special tours of the facility and visitors can even jump into a mock-up space suit, hop in the centrifuge, or board a “zero-gravity” flight that simulates weightlessness through a parabolic trajectory. But for those who prefer to keep their feet on the ground, Star City also offers more down-to-earth activities. In fact, the cosmonaut simulation experience does not even require you to leave your seat at the planetarium, where you can learn to navigate using thousands of stars as your reference. Meanwhile, the museum of space travel and exploration has an impressive collection of vintage spacesuits, capsules charred from reentering the atmosphere, and a replica of Gagarin’s office, which holds a book that is routinely signed by every crew before launch. And if you’re fortunate enough to visit on the Fourth of July, you might experience Star City’s celebration at the homes built for NASA personnel in the 1990s. Just look for the American-style tract houses among the sea of Khrushchev-era concrete buildings. Star City (Zvyozdny Gorodok) is located near Shchyolkovo, about an hour's drive northeast of Moscow.

164,Lubyanka,"Moscow, Russia",Former headquarters of the KGB.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lubyanka,"Lubyanka was the heart of darkness of the old USSR, the fabled headquarters of the KGB and home of an infamous jail where spies, political dissidents, and various enemies of the State were imprisoned, interrogated, and tortured. An old joke called Lubyanka the tallest building in Moscow, since Siberia could be seen from its basement. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn described the horrors of the Lubyanka, where he was imprisoned, in his epic book The Gulag Archipelago. Simeon Vilensky, a woman who spent time in the Lubyanka, described the horrible silence of the prison at night. The guards were not allowed to speak and communicated in the darkness by clicking their tongues, a noise that was punctuated only by the occasional wail or a prisoner. The Lubyanka building, a massive yellow brick structure in the neo-baroque style, looks slightly less menacing than the organization it once housed. It was originally built in 1897 for the All-Russia Insurance Company, but after the October Revolution the building was re-purposed and became the headquarters of the Cheka, the first secret police organization of new socialist state. Until the fall of the USSR in 1991, the adjacent square featured a monument to ‘Iron’ Felix Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the organization. The Soviet secret police organization has changed names several times but never left the building. The same office on the third floor was used by all the chiefs of the service, from Lavrenty Beria to Yuri Andropov. The building was extended and enlarged in two intervals, first in the period between 1940-1947, by the addition of one story, and again in 1983. Today it is home to the headquarters of The FSB, or The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, Border Control, and the KGB Museum.

The clock begins its show with some eerie chime music to which the owl turns its head. Then the peacock gracefully turns its neck and lifts its tail slowly before quickly turning around to display its fan of golden feathers. The spectacle concludes with the crowing of a rooster below. The cycle is meant to represent the end of night and the rise of the sun, suggesting the continuity of life.

Excavation of the pit began in 1955, and today it is 1,722 feet (525 meters) deep, and 3,900 feet (1.25 kilometers) across. Stalin ordered the construction of the mine to satisfy the Soviet Union’s need for industrial-grade diamonds following the war. The harsh, frozen Siberian landscape made working on the mine a difficult proposition at best. Jet engines were turned on the unyielding permafrost in order to melt it; when that failed, explosives were used. During its peak years of operation, the Mir mine, also called Mirny mine, produced over 10 million carats of diamonds annually, a good percentage of which were gem-quality. Although open pit mining has ceased here, mining work is continuing by underground methods. The massive 20-foot (6 meters) tall rock-hauling trucks that service the Mirny mine travel along a road that spirals down from the lip of the hole to its basin.

169,Tunguska Event Epicenter,"Evenkiysky District, Russia",Site of the largest impact event to occur over land in Earth's recorded history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tunguska-event-epicenter,"On June 30, 1908, at 7:17 in the morning, a catastrophic event wreaked havoc on the Podkamennaya Tunguska River basin. Eyewitness accounts from Siberian villagers described a bright blue light that streaked across the sky, followed by a violent flash and a barrage of noise much like the sound of artillery fire. Tremors shook the ground, while a powerful shockwave shattered windows and knocked people off their feet. Effects of the blast were felt thousands of miles away. Fluctuations in atmospheric transparency were recorded across North America, and throughout Europe and Asia, the night sky was so bright that a newspaper could be read in its light for weeks afterward. Immediately following the so-called “Tunguska Event,” there were few scientific attempts to explain the mysterious occurrence. In fact, more than ten years passed before the first scientific expedition, led by the Russian mineralogist Leonid Kulik, attempted to visit the event’s epicenter. When Kulik and his team finally arrived in 1927, what they discovered shocked them. At that time, it was assumed that the Tunguska Event was actually a meteorite impact. However, at ground zero there was no crater to be found. Instead, trees at the epicenter stood vertically, scorched and stripped of their bark. Farther out, trees were toppled over on their sides and pointing away from the center. In fact, the explosion leveled 80 million trees over 830 square miles of forest. But what could cause such a violent event without leaving so much as a dent in the ground? This question has perplexed scientists for over a century, and the Tunguska Event debate remains a heated one. Today, the most favored explanation involves the mid-air explosion of a large meteoroid or comet. At about 28,000 feet above the Earth’s surface, many scientists believe, a chunk of rock or ice measuring tens of meters across broke apart from the heat and pressure of the atmosphere. Traveling at a speed of over 33,000 mph, this explosion would have created a shock wave about 1000 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Directly below the blast, the trees were stripped but remained standing because the shockwave would have been traveling vertically downward. Further out, however, the shockwave would have been traveling in a more horizontal direction, explaining the vast area of flattened forest. This scenario would also account for the lack of a crater. It is thought that the “impacting” body would have been torn apart into small enough pieces that no large chunks reached the surface. Furthermore, those in favor of the comet hypothesis believe the brightened night sky was a result of noctilucent clouds: high-altitude clouds made of highly reflective ice that would have formed from the water vapor injected into the atmosphere by the exploding comet. Though the scientific explanation might sound quite complicated, even wilder Tunguska theories have proliferated over the years. Among the more far-fetched culprits of the blast are a tiny black hole passing through the Earth, a UFO crash, and even Nikola Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower.

Your trip will start in Moscow city where you will take a 6-hour flight to the Siberian city of Yakutsk. This trip will cost you an average of $800 since there are no other airlines competing for this route. Upon arrival in Yakutsk, you will learn that you can only get to Lena’s Pillars by boat. Supposedly this is only a half a day’s trip upriver; in fact the trip with takes 3 days with a local guide and costs $500. Lena’s Pillars are a natural rock formation which was made a World Heritage site in 2006. Numerous fossils and ancient organisms can be found at these pillars, and the area is important for its fossil record of the explosion of life in the lower Cambrian. It has also been the site of many mega-fauna fossils such as mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius Blum), bison (Bison priscus Boj), woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis Blum), Lena horse (Equus lenensis Russ), and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L). Evidence of ancient human life can be seen from the rock paintings and manuscripts from the area. Although Lena’s Pillars are an amazing sight to behold, be aware of the long (and expensive) trip ahead of you, as well as the lack of basic comforts and amenities due to the remoteness and isolation of the of the area.",martian landscapes geological oddities natural wonders ecosystems geology nature

Rising on a 350-foot high plume of smoke and condensation, the Monument to the Conquerors of Space commemorates Yuri Gagarin’s 1961 orbit of earth and the Soviet Union’s preeminence in outer space. Three years before Gagarin ever began orbit, plans for the monument were already in progress. As evidence of the importance of showmanship in the space race, the Soviet Union planned to erect an obelisk commemorating their space dominance just months after Sputnik launched. After sifting through hundreds of proposals, they chose the massive obelisk, and construction on the titanium pillar was completed in 1964. Blasting into the sky and capped with a rocket, the monument towers over stone reliefs of scientists and cosmonauts working to improve the Soviet space program.

Baikal seals are among the few seals to live exclusively in freshwater. The only other species of freshwater seals are the couple hundred Saimaa Ringed Seals found in Lake Saimaa in Finland and the few thousand Ladoga Ringed Seals in Lake Ladoga in northwestern Russia. The Baikal Seals are named after Lake Baikal, which is the only place in the world where these special little seals are found. Lake Baikal in Siberia is itself a record-holding site. It is the world’s oldest lake, dating from 25 to 30 million years ago, and the world’s largest lake, 395 miles wide and more than 5,000 feet deep. The seals are relatively small, only about four feet long and weighing around 150 pounds each. They survive on the small fish that reside in the lake. Every winter, the lake freezes over. In order to breath during these months of frost and darkness, the seals dig breathing holes with their sharp claws and sometimes with their teeth. Pregnant females will spend most of the winter on the ice. Though some poaching has reduced the seal population, local governments now restrict hunting and the population is around a comfortable 80,000 animals. Because this is their only habitat, though, the seals would be easily threatened if the ecosystem was disrupted. Zoologists have hypothesized that the seals came to the lake when it was still connected to the Arctic Ocean.",lakes natural wonders water nature animals
173,Muromtzevo Castle,"Sudogda, Russia","Abandoned castle was once a grand example of Russian privilege, built exclusively to win a frivolous bet between noblemen.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/muromtzevo-castle,"The legend of this odd castle begins in the 19th century, when a Russian nobleman traveling through France made aquaintance with a French lord. The two began to squabble over the superiority of each country, and after tiring of the lord extolling the ornate architecture of France, the Russian declared that he could erect a castle of equal magnificence in his own country. The Frenchman scoffed, and replied if he could build a castle as grandiose as the ones in France, he would come to Russia himself to see it. Vladimir Khrapovitsky, challenged by this wager, returned home, promptly purchasing a piece of land outside of Vladimir, and contracting P. S. Boitzov, arguably the best architect in Russia at the time. Built roughly in the style of a medieval German castle with a hint of French chateau, the structure was an architectural anomaly in the Russian landscape. Eventually, stables, a pavilion, a pond, and many other amenities were added, and it’s said that the Frenchman did indeed keep up his end of the bargain and come to visit. When the Russian Revolution came to pass, Khrapovitsky was forced to flee his lavish creation, and is said to have died in squalor. His exquisite estate was used as a college for a time and then a hospital while the Great Patriotic War was raging, but eventually it fell into disrepair, with no plans for restoration currently being pursued. The castle is still standing and begging to be explored. Nature has invaded the grounds, and the floors are not entirely sturdy, so investigate with caution. The best way to get there is to take a bus from the Vladimir bus station to the town of Sudoga. This should take half an hour to an hour or so. From the Sudogda station you can take a bus to Muromtsevo or ask a local to take you to the castle (zamok) – it’ll only cost a couple bucks and 5-10 minutes to get to the castle. The Castle has recently been fenced off and now has a 24hr guard watch. You can only get on Castle grounds with tour guide. And the interior is completely sealed off.

The next thing you’ll notice is another immortalized icon of Russian culture: an eerily life-like wax figure of Aleksandr Pushkin. It was here that he took his last drink—a fresh-squeezed lemonade, it’s said—before setting out to a fatal duel in 1837. Of course, it was over a woman. Today, his wax likeness sits by the window in front of his final drink, ruminating the next line he would never write. Pushkin wouldn’t have been the lone icon who patronized the spot in the 1800s. Before the Literary Cafe was known as such, it was a confectionery shop that drew figures of such cultural magnitude as Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and Feodor Chaliapin. Its location in the heart of St. Petersburg made it the place to see and be seen. Today, the two-story restaurant celebrates its role in the arts scene of old by maintaining an air of imperial aristocracy, from the crystal chandeliers to the white-gloved servers to the high-end Russian-French cuisine. Diners can choose from the “Poet’s Menu,” a collection of Pushkin’s allegedly favorite orders, including schi (a stuffed cabbage soup), pozharsky (breaded chicken breast with cranberry sauce), and a dessert of stuffed prunes with vanilla-stewed apples and vanilla ice cream.

The quaint dachas (Russian country cottages) that dot the tree-lined streets make this neighborhood look more like a rural village than an urban settlement. Though its name translates to “falcon,” the village has been dubbed “artist’s village” because its streets are named for prominent painters. It was founded in 1923 as an example of the “city-garden” architectural concept, which aimed to combine the best features of living in the city and in the countryside. The Soviet architects responsible for Moscow’s urban planning intended to fill the city’s suburbs with such villages. The planners purposely laid diagonal streets to quiet the winds and lessen the chill they brought to the frigid winter air (indeed, when you walk along the streets of the village in cold weather, it is usually a bit warmer there than outside of the area). At the time Sokol was built, the array of cottages sat on the outskirts of the city, far from its center. But as Moscow expanded throughout the 20th century, towering apartment blocks encroached upon its territory until the city eventually swallowed the little village. Considering the village’s good location today, the land and the houses have become increasingly expensive. Some of the owners sold their houses for hefty amounts to millionaires who demolished the old dachas and built modern villas in their places. However, many owners have maintained the historic appearance of the houses, and quite a lot of them still look more or less the same as they did in the beginning of the 20th century.

Cast in 1735 at the request of Empress Anna Ioanovna, a niece of Peter the Great, the great bell has suffered a long series of misfortunes. The difficulty in casting such a large bell was blamed for the death of the father of the Motorin family team of Russian craftsmen, who made the bell, after a fire destroyed the derrick that was to lift the bell from its cast. A second fire ravaged the area surrounding the bell in 1737, and the heat from it caused a portion of the bell to shatter. Today, the eleven-ton broken piece lies beside the bell’s pedestal. The bronze bell is estimated to weigh between 200 and 216 tons and stands 20.1 feet high with a diameter of 21.6 feet. It is sometimes referred to as the Royal Bell or Tsar Kolokol III (“Tsar Bell”). Two prior attempts to cast such a tremendous bell failed, and the bronze from those castings was used in the creation of the present bell. For a portion of its history, the bell served as a small chapel with people entering and exiting the large opening created when it shattered. Though the bell has never been rung, a legend exists that states that the bell will be miraculously repaired and ring out a call for prayer on Judgment Day. The bell rests on a pedestal at the foot of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in Moscow.",architectural oddities architecture

The site is most notable for its striking decorations; oversized, grotesque sculptures of deep-sea creatures which dominate the complex. The camp was built by the Young Pioneer Organisation, a children’s program founded by Lenin for the purposes of education and the propagation of Marxist ideology. During the height of the movement there were as many as 40,000 such camps spread across the USSR, catering to millions of young minds. Camps were often specialised to deliver a blend of fun, games and career-specific training; there were sports camps, technical camps, geological and naturalist camps. Few such sites now remain, most of them having been torn down following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. While it’s hard to find information about this particular camp, the aquatic theme of the decor would seem to suggest a link to marine biology and naturalism. In addition to a giant octopus, seahorses, squid and a two-storey flounder, other sculptures depict Soviet symbols and otherworldly, fantastical creatures. One of the more bizarre installations features a child caught in the grip of some kind of deep-sea terror. In the overgrown central courtyard, meanwhile, amidst flocks of grazing sheep there stands a memorial bust of Lenin himself. The location of this camp makes it rather difficult to find, tucked away on an unmarked road which cuts through the heart of a dense forest.

179,Soviet Dacha,"Moscow, Russia",This frozen-in-time summer home outside Moscow provides a look at Russian life in the 1950s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soviet-dacha,"In the 17th century, Russian Tsars began rewarding loyal landholders with small estates called “dachas” in the country. (The word translates from old Russian to “something given.”) Most dachas were nationalized after the Russian Revolution in the early 1900s, and since then, upper and middle class Soviets have used them for summer homes. In the 1980s, just before the Soviet Union dissolved, there was a boom in the popularity of dachas. At that point, somewhere around one in three families owned a dacha where they’d spend weekends and escape the heat of the summer. Now it’s estimated that half of all Russian families living in big cities own a second home. In southern Moscow, one of these ubiquitous summer homes has been turned into a public museum frozen in time. The home is filled with artifacts from the Soviet era. Visitors are served Russian tea in the glasses in old metal holders. They can help make dumplings and borscht, and try vegetables, fruits, and herbs from the garden, an essential part of many dachas. A tour, guided by the homeowner, Nadia, is designed around the children’s books, records, furniture, dishes, clothes, and technology of the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s. Considering the state-guided universality of Soviet life, and Nadia’s knowledge of the history of Russia and USSR, the home provides a very broad experience of Soviet life, and many consider the preserved home in the Moscow countryside a hidden gem.",summer tea communism soviet history houses homes history

Thanks to the geopolitical aftermath of World War II, this small Russian territory is in the curious position of not touching any other part of Russia. For centuries, the region was part of the German state of East Prussia. It was annexed by the USSR after World War II, which proceeded to push out all the Germans who still lived there and rename the territory Kaliningrad after the Soviet leader Mikhail Kalinin. Stalin argued to keep the territory as it would be Russia’s only non-frozen port, provide access to the Baltic Sea, and serve as a foothold in Europe. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, Kaliningrad was left wedged between the independent nations of Poland  and  Lithuania. Those countries joined the European Union, Russia did not, and Kaliningrad, still under the control of Russia, became the geographic anomaly it remains today. The territory’s population currently hovers around 1 million. Old medieval castles and ruins of forts are sprinkled throughout the area leftover from the East Prussia days, as well as sandy beaches on the Baltic. However visitors have become scarce as Kaliningrad’s economy struggles and the area is increasingly tied to the Russian mafia. The region is well-connected to European Russia and Belarus, with numerous flights and trains. The local airport is an international one, with flights to/from a few major destinations like Prague, Barcelona, Warsaw, Berlin, Riga, as well as Tashkent, Djerba and a few charters in summer. Another option is to fly into a neighboring country and take a bus, train or ferry to the region. You can also drive to Kaliningrad Oblast, as roads have greatly improved. However, the lines at the borders can sometimes take up to 4 hours depending on the time of day.

More people might be surprised by the fact that Kadykchan has only been unpopulated for two years. Built in the 1930s by Gulag prisoners, the town of Kadykchan was constructed in the modern Far Eastern Federal District around the coal mines in the region. After the Gulag prisoners were released in 1960, many stayed in the Russian Far East to continue living in the cities and working in the mines. Considering that the Far Eastern Federal District boasts only 2.5 people per square mile and permafrost cuts the growing season to three months, Kadykchan did not exactly grow into a vibrant metropolis. However, the population slowly grew and hit a peak in 1986 at 10,000 people, fairly respectable by Siberian standards. Unfortunately, the town was hit hard by the fall of the Soviet Union, and subsequent devaluation of coal. Throughout the 1990s, a steady stream of Kadykchan residents left for larger cities. In 1996, an accident in the mine killed 6 people and was the final straw. Throughout the post-Soviet era, the population of Kadykchan dropped from over 10,000 people, to under 300 in 2007. Since many of the residents left very quickly, Kadykchan is now eerily filled with relics of its past. Posters still hang on walls, books are flung about on coffee tables and broken-down cars still haunt old garages. A bust of Lenin is also still visible in the town, although fairly decrepit at this point. It seems only a matter of hard winters before the father of the Soviet party crumbles with the rest of Kadykchan.",prisons ghost towns
182,Kola Superdeep Borehole,"Murmansk, Russia","The deepest hole drilled in the name of science, where evidence of Precambrian life was found.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kola-superdeep-borehole,"It has been said that the human race knows more about certain distant galaxies than it does about the ground that lies beneath its very feet. In fact, while it took the famous Voyager 1 satellite 26 years to exit our Solar System (relaying measurements to Earth from 16.5 billion km away), it took about the same amount of time for humanity to penetrate a mere 12 km into the Earth’s surface. While the U.S. and U.S.S.R. vied for space exploration supremacy during the Space Race, a different, less-publicized race took place between the two nations’ greatest drillers. In the late 1950s and early 1960s Americans and Soviets began planning separate efforts to drill as deep as possible into the Earth’s crust, the rocky shell that comprises the outer 30-50 km of the 6730 km distance to our planet’s core. The American “Project Mohole,” stationed off the Pacific coast of Mexico, was cut short in 1966 due to lack of funding but set an important precedent for future off-shore drilling programs. The Soviets, thanks to the planning of the Interdepartmental Scientific Council for the Study of the Earth’s Interior and Superdeep Drilling, had greater success. From 1970 to 1994 their drill on the Kola Peninsula chipped slowly away to create a Earth-shattering record at the time: the deepest hole in the world. In actuality, the Kola Superdeep Borehole consists of several holes branching from one central hole. The deepest hole is called “SG-3,” and though just nine inches in diameter, it extends down a staggering 7.5 miles. That’s roughly a third of the way through the Baltic continental crust. To meet scientific objectives and provide a nearly continuous look at the crust’s profile, the Soviets even developed instruments to take direct physical measurements at the bottom of the borehole. The drilling apparatus thus allowed for greater measurement integrity, since rock samples would deform under their incredible internal pressure when brought to the surface. Needless to say, the project produced enormous amounts of geological data, most of which elucidated how little we know about our planet. The study of the Earth is often largely limited to surface observations and seismic studies, but the Kola borehole allowed a direct look at the structure of the crust and put geologists’ theories to the test. One of the most surprising findings was the absence of the transition from granite to basalt, which scientists had long expected to exist between three and six kilometers below the surface. Known to geologists as the “Conrad discontinuity,” this transition in rock type was reasoned to exist due to the results of seismic-reflection surveys. Though the discontinuity has been detected beneath all of the continents, the drill at Kola never encountered the proposed layer of basalt. Instead, the granitic rock was found to extend beyond the twelve kilometer point. This led to scientists’ realization that the seismic-reflection results were due to a metamorphic change in the rock (i.e. from intense heat and pressure), and not a change in rock type as they had previously anticipated. But the most intriguing discovery made by the Kola borehole researchers is undoubtedly the detection of biological activity in rocks more than two billion years old. The clearest evidence of life came in the form of microscopic fossils encased in organic compounds that remained surprisingly intact despite the extreme pressures and temperatures of the surrounding rock. While data produced by the Kola drilling project continues to be analyzed, the drilling itself was forced to stop in the early 1990s when unexpectedly high temperatures were encountered. While the temperature gradient conformed to predictions down to a depth of about 10,000 feet, temperatures after this point increased at a higher rate until they reached 180 °C (or 356 °F) at the bottom of the hole. This was a drastic difference from the expected 100 °C (212 °F). Also unexpected was a decrease in rock density after the first 14,800 feet. Beyond this point the rock had greater porosity and permeability which, paired with the high temperatures, caused the rock to behave more like a plastic than a solid and made drilling near impossible. A repository of the many core samples can be found in the nickel-mining town of Zapolyarny, about ten kilometers south of the hole. For its ambitious mission and its contributions to geology and biology, the Kola Superdeep Borehole remains one of the most important relics of Soviet-era science.  The Kola Superdeep Borehole is located 10 kilometers north of the town of Zapolyarny, in the Pechengsky District of Murmansk Oblast, Russia. The Kola Core Repository is in the town of Zapolyarny.

Under the guise of designing a model for economizing space and materials, architect Konstantin Melnikov was given special permission build an experimental house to be used as a model for future homes. Though no other houses came from it, his family was able to live in the distinctive structure. The building itself is truly avant-garde, especially when you take the era into consideration. It consists of two intersecting circles that create a harmonic unity. The interior needed fewer walls, which meant saving on materials. The building’s honeycomb structure made it so that bricks were needed only for making borders around the hexagonal windows, which provide enough light for the massive rooms inside. The structure also includes two big halls which served as studios for Melnikov’s work. In 1937, the All Union Congress of Soviet Architects revoked Melnikov’s right to practice architecture, and in later years local authorities attempted many times to gain control of the building. Owning private property was an anomaly, and such a big building could easily house multiple families, but every time the question was raised, Melnikov wrote a letter of petition to local authorities, reminding them he was the designer of Lenin’s sarcophagus. No one was willing to act against a person with such a credit, and Melnikov’s family was allowed to keep the place all for themselves. The house, which has been kept in its original state throughout its history, was turned into a museum and is listed as a cultural heritage site. The house can be seen from outside all the time.

Featuring elegantly designed stations with marble columns and exquisitely detailed ceilings and light fixtures, Moscow’s magnificent new metro (so the story went) was but a taste of the glorious future the Soviet system would deliver. That didn’t end up working out too well. But the progressive crumbling and ultimate collapse of the USSR didn’t take any of the shine off of the capital’s underground transit system. Expanded in multiple stages after its inauguration, today the Moscow Metro is the fifth-longest metro system in the world and carries more passengers than any other system outside of Asia. Moreover, the opulent design of the stations–which grew in subsequent stages to include chandeliers, painted rotundas, and fine works of art–makes the system an attraction independent of its role as a means of transportation. You can even visit a museum covering the history of this remarkable specimen of urban planning and socialist realist aesthetic–if you know where to look. From southern end of the lobby of the Sportivnaya Metro station, there is a stairway to the third floor (“through a room where police are checking documents, past those that are detained”) which houses a free museum dedicated to the history of the Moscow Metro. Inside are photographic exhibits showing the construction of various stations and railways; celebrations from the opening of the system; uses of the stations during wartime for sleeping, meeting, and taking shelter; and other aspects of the system’s history. Beyond the photographs, the museum exhibits actual equipment from the Metro system, including different kinds of tracks and cabling, turnstiles, tokens, uniforms, a miniature model escalator, and even a section of a train car.

188,Kostroma Moose Farm,"Bolshoye Andreykovo, Russia",The USSR’s Conquest of Nature lead to the domestication of many moose—no squirrel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kostroma-moose-farm,"In the early 1930s, the Soviet Union set it sights on taking over the world—on moose-back. Moose, being large, strong and agile, seemed to be perfect for the Communist cavalry. However, with the onset of the Soviet-Finnish war in 1939 followed closely by World War II, training operations came to a halt. After these failed attempts at world domination, the post-World War II Soviet Union embarked upon even loftier goals: the conquest of nature. These efforts included, among other things, the training and domestication of moose for transportation. In addition to possibly being handy pack and passenger animals, it was soon noted that after being fattened up on a steady diet of the unusable scrap leftover from their booming timber industry, moose could nourish the starving populace, and the first moose farm was born. Pechora Farm, established some time between 1943 and 1949, was tasked with breeding and training moose for milk, meat and draught purposes. Despite initial apprehension,(can you imagine trying to milk a moose?), it turned out these gentle giants were just as easily milked as cows. However, raising them for meat proved prohibitively expensive and moose, being clever creatures, wouldn’t be led easily to slaughter. In addition, despite years of brutal and bloody experimentation, it was also soon discovered that it’s difficult to make a moose do what a moose does not wish to do and efforts to train and control them were abandoned. In 1963 Kostroma Farm opened starting with just two calves and has been home to over 800 moose. Initially under the umbrella of various scientific and agricultural agencies, the farm is now independent and its official name is Sumarokovo Moose Farm, State Budget Scientific Research Institution of the Kostroma Region. Today the farm’s primary functions are the production of moose milk which is sold to the nearby Ivan Susanin Sanatorium for use in the treatment of ulcers and radiation lesions, the harvesting of moose antler velvet for pharmaceutical purposes, and as a tourist attraction.

189,State Darwin Museum,"Moscow, Russia",The world's first museum dedicated to the work of game-changing naturalist Charles Darwin.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/state-darwin-museum,"It’s fitting that the largest natural history museum would be dedicated to one of history’s most prominent and celebrated naturalists. Charles Darwin was an English naturalist. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and proposed the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. The State Darwin Museum (SDM) was built in Moscow in 1907, under pressure and persuasion from A.F. Kots, a young Russian scientist who was very fond of Darwin. It is said to have been the first museum of natural history in the world. There are more than 5,000 items occupying the three floors of the museum. One of the more impressive sections has a plethora of dinosaur models, presented with a fabulous dinosaur soundtrack. SDM presents a complete scientific picture of the evolution of the living world, and a large display showing the variety of wildlife on earth, with animals from all climatic zones from the North Pole to the South. One of the largest collections of the museum is the birds collection, which consists of many exotic species, including hummingbirds and birds of paradise.",darwin cultures and civilizations natural history natural wonders plants nature museums and collections animals
190,Aquarelle Train on The Moscow Metro,"Moscow, Russia",Museum design and public transportation meet in this unique Russian train car.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aquarelle-train-on-the-moscow-metro,"From dogs that ride the train cars independent of owners to metro stops that look like period mansions, the Moscow Metro system is one of the most astonishing public transit systems in the world. Among its many wonders are the themed cars of the Red Line including the museum-quality Aquarelle Train. The Aquarelle Train (or Watercolor Train in English) is often stumbled upon by accident, as it runs its standard route just like any other subway car, despite looking like anything but an ordinary passenger train. Located on the Sokolnicheskaya (Red) Line, this train is immediately distinguishable from the other cars by the watercolor painting replica that wraps the exterior. The vibrant floral pattern that speeds into each station makes the train look like a painting brought to life, and that is just the beginning of the artistic experience offered by the transit module. Unlike the functional but drab insides of most train cars, the inside of the Aquarelle Train has been designed to look like a lush museum. Facing each row of seats are reproductions of known paintings held in fancy frames that would otherwise seem out of place in the underground. The actual walls of the cars have been painted in deep blues and reds bringing the artful serenity of an actual museum collection to the screeching hustle and bustle of the subway. The Aquarelle Train has been running its route since June 1st, 2007, Moscow’s “Year of the Child.” The stated goal of the Aquarelle Train being to remind adults riding the train of the child-like sense of discovery that art can bring. In addition to the watercolor train there are three other themed trains running on the Red Line including a Reading Train, Poetry Train, and Retro Train, designed to look like the very first train car that ever operated on the Moscow Metro. With so much to see on the line, the destination hardly matters. The Aquarelle Train can be found running on the Arbatsko-Porkovskaya Line.

191,Nabokov's Butterflies,"Saint Petersburg, Russia","Specimens collected by the author of ""Lolita"" and self-taught lepidopterist are exhibited in his childhood home.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nabokov-s-butterflies,"While renowned for authoring literary masterpieces like Lolita and Pale Fire, Vladimir Nabokov was also an active collector of butterflies and has gained much posthumous respect for his scientific research. At least 570 mentions of butterflies have been counted in his work and over 20 species of butterfly have been named after his fictional characters. The Russian author’s passion for lepidoptery, the study of butterflies, is preserved in his collection of pinned shimmery-winged insects in the Nabokov Museum in St. Petersburg. After catching his first butterfly at the age of six, Nabokov’s curiosity became an obsession. When he was eight, he brought a butterfly to his father who had been imprisoned for political activities. After his family escaped in 1917 to Crimea from the Bolshevik Revolution, he studied butterflies to ward off homesickness. When he fled the Nazis to the United States in 1940, he took the job of Curator of Lepidoptera at Harvard University’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, where he spent his time sorting and mounting butterflies for up to 14 hours a day and collected butterflies around the country. In 1945, he developed a theory on butterfly evolution based on his examination of the Polyommatus blues that had them journeying in five waves from Asia over the Bering Strait south into Chile before going north to the New World. Although his theories were dismissed by contemporary lepidopterists, in 2011 the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London announced that after using gene-sequencing technology it had been confirmed that Nabokov was completely right in his theory. Following the commercial success of Lolita, he moved back to Europe in 1958 to Switzerland, partly for the butterflies that fluttered over its alpine meadows. While he worked on two butterfly books, Butterflies of Europe and Butterflies in Art, he never finished either. After a bad fall on an alpine slope during a butterfly-catching expedition, he died in Lausanne on July 2, 1977. Although an avid collector throughout his life, his only collections that still exist are those he assembled while in the United States and in Switzerland. The remains have dispersed to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the museums of Harvard and Cornell, the Zoological Museum in Lausanne, and the Nabokov Museum in St. Petersburg on Bolshaya Morskaya Street, established in the house where he was born in 1899. The house has undergone significant change since his family left in 1917, yet it still possesses much of its old world aesthetic in its dining room, drawing room, and library. Nabokov fans can appreciate it as “the only house in the world,” which, like the fleeting beauty of butterflies, made regular appearances in his prose.",bug week butterflies insects natural history collections
192,Gulag Museum,"Perm, Russia",Former prison camp dedicated to the victims of political repression.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gulag-museum,"For over forty years, Gulag Perm-36 was used to house some of the Soviet Union’s most vocal opponents. The camp first opened its doors in 1946. The inmates, known as ‘zeks’ were forced to cut down trees and ship them down river to help rebuild towns and villages destroyed during World War II. At its height, the camp could accommodate a thousand prisoners, who toiled in appalling conditions for up to sixteen hours every day. Any dissent was crushed and prisoners were often beaten, placed in solitary confinement, or strip searched in the freezing cold. The unremitting brutality of the camp took its toll and many people perished there, where they were often buried in a grave marked only by a numbered post in the ground. In 1972, the camp was converted into the main place of imprisonment for political prisoners. Perhaps the most famous inmate was Ukrainian poet and dissident Vasyl Stus, who was nominated for the 1986 Nobel Prize for Literature. He died while on a hunger strike on September 4, 1985, having spent nearly half of his life imprisoned in various gulags around the country. It was not until December 1987 that the gulag finally closed its doors. All other camps were destroyed, but a coalition of former inmates, human rights activists, and Russian historians were able to save it. In 1996, the Memorial Center for the History of Political Repressions was opened. Featuring many exhibits on the prisoners’ daily lives, it serves as a permanent reminder of the cruelty and violence of the Soviet era. The museum is about 10 kilometers from the town Chusovoy, which is 100 km east of Perm.",prisons crime and punishment memento mori

Bolshoi Zayatsky Island, in particular, looks straight out of a fantasy novel, due to the mysterious labyrinths of ancient origin dotted across its grounds. The island is less than one square mile in total, but is covered in dozens of labyrinths. They have been dated as far back as 30,000 B.C. but have remained surprisingly intact. Some are made of stone heaps, while others have been built into the landscape in the form of earthen mounds. Archaeologists have been unable to pin down the exact purpose of the labyrinths, but the consensus appears to be that they were for mystical use. Suggestions for their purpose include a portal to the underworld, a trap for evil spirits, or the altar of a ritual ceremony. It’s clear that Bolshoi Zayatsky Island was once a place for magic, though we may never know exactly what kind.",ancient technology labyrinths mazes magic ancient islands

The Russian author penned “The Double” and “The Brothers Karamazov” in the home before dying at 59 years old in 1881. The F. M. Dostoyevsky Literary Memorial Museum opened on what would’ve been the author’s 150th birthday. That it took so long is a testament to the Soviet desire to repress his radical politics and religious nationalism. His apartment was recreated based on accounts of his contemporaries and the memoirs of his wife Anna. His descendants donated books to the massive literary collection that recalls his life and work. The museum is comprised of the writer’s memorial apartment, the literary exhibit, and the White Theater. Its collections have grown exponentially throughout the decades. The library has over 24,000 volumes and manuscripts. The museum is often included in cultural tours (and Dostoevsky-specific ones) in Saint Petersburg.

The Soviet Lifestyle Museum explores the USSR’s musical, educational, and yes, propagandistic days of yore. Kitsch isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when people talk about the old USSR, but at the Soviet Lifestyle Museum, it’s king. Held in a former communal apartment that would have been home to 20 some people, the little museum is now home to a collection that has items from time periods ranging from the 1930s to the 1990s, focusing on a few distinct aspects of Soviet life. One portion of the exhibit focuses on the high school experience, and claims to be one of the most comprehensive collections on the subject in existence. There is also a gallery that displays a collection of Soviet-era artwork, and a selection of propaganda books. However maybe the strangest aspect of the museum is the section dedicated to the influence of rock-and-roll in the Soviet Union. With a collection of around 60 guitars signed by artists ranging from Sting to Scorpions, it shines a light on the influence of Western music in the culture of the time. There is also a rack of clothes that guests are welcome to try on and take pictures in. Because if you are going to travel back to the Soviet 80s, it’s pics or it didn’t happen.

Tens, if not hundreds of millions of them lose their lives every year in the U.S. alone, in the name of science.

The Monument to the Laboratory Mouse can be found in a courtyard at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics in Akademgorodok, Russia, a research facility associated with Novosibirsk State University that seeks to better understand the nature of DNA. The mighty mouse is of the anthropomorphic variety, with glasses, dressed in a lab coat, and studiously knitting a DNA double helix. The wise-looking rodent symbolizes the gradual progress of DNA research through the years, to a large extent thanks to the sacrifice of countless numbers of his own species. There are a number of characteristics that have made the mouse the most commonly used mammal for testing and research, one of which is that they are in the same super-order of mammals as humans. This provides for similar genetics despite the very visible differences—although those differences are a lot less visible with our little friend here.

Fortunately for those who want to see the entire northern nation from Vladivostok to Kaliningrad in just a few hours, there’s the Grand Maket Rossiya, or Grand Model of Russia, in St. Petersburg. Built over the course of five years by more than 400 modelers, artists, and computer scientists using extensive wooden frames and 11 tons of plaster, the scale model represents nearly the entirety of Russia. Every major feature of the country is represented, though not always precisely, for space reasons, from the Ural Mountains to a frog on the side of a river, the Kremlin to a woman feeding her chickens as they peck at the ground. The model even experiences changes in weather and season, and a day lasts 15 minutes (13 minutes of daylight, 2 minutes of night). Some 500,000 LED lights are used to create this effect. Miniature fires are fought and miniature prisoners try to escape prison. Tiny rifles go off and tiny movies play on tiny screens. Somewhere on the model, there’s even a tiny UFO. Over an area of 800 square meters, trains run on 2,500 meters of rails, and there are turntables to turn them around when they reach the end of the line. Cars and trucks not only drive on the road, but sometimes change speeds to pass each other or stop at a light. All of this is controlled remotely, and some of it can be manipulated by visitors by way of buttons on the side of the model. The Grand Maket Rossiya was created by St. Petersburg businessman Sergey Morozov, and is housed in a two-story Stalin-era building, where it officially opened in June of 2012. The model is so big, visitors are offered binoculars to rent to see all of the details. The only model in the world that is bigger is Hamburg’s Miniatur Wunderland.

The year was 1918. After almost a year of confinement, Emperor Nicholas, his wife, and their children were gathered at an engineer’s home in Yekaterinburg, Russia, to meet their fate. The Bolsheviks who held them had received orders to kill the royal family and destroy the bodies with acid so that they would not become objects of veneration. When Nicholas and his family arrived, the Empress complained that there were no chairs. Chairs were brought in, the family was seated, and they were then informed that they were sentenced to death. “What? What?” shouted a stunned Nicholas before he was killed in a hail of bullets to the chest. His daughters survived the first round of bullets, protected by the dozens of gems and diamonds sewn into their underclothes. The executioners, horrified that rumors that the tsars were supernatural might be true, quickly disproved that myth by stabbing the girls with their bayonets and shooting them at point-blank range in their heads. The home which stood on the site was demolished in 1977, but the basement of the structure remained. Visitors still came to the barren location, despite the removal of the home, to remember the fallen family. Finally, in 2000, approval was given to erect a church on the spot of the murders. Construction was completed in 2003, with the basement from the original home becoming a part of the present structure. Special Tsar’s Days are held each year during July in Yekaterinburg, accompanied by pageants held in remembrance of the Romanov Dynasty.

Among the glass cases full of skulls and bits of wax anatomy, there are movable glass models of a man and woman complete with a variety of internal organs for the viewing as well as some reportedly grim displays regarding the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Many of the displays regard “bad habits” and their consequences, but then oddly, the museum presents visitors with one of Pavlov’s original dogs, stuffed and displayed in a glass case trussed up by each leg just as in Pavlov’s original experiments.

Lubenko began the project in 1984, when he decided to jazz up his workspace. He, alongside the students, continued adding new artwork after he opened a school. Their imaginative fairytale figures cover the walls and benches. Plump figures glint and glitter like abstract, shaped disco balls. Large sculptures, both animal and human, dot the grounds. There’s even a small jungle gym covered entirely in brilliant mosaics. The planters, too, boast their own shiny glass scenes.

In a passing glance, it seems more like a princess’ legendary palace, but the minarets with crescent moons signal something very different. Qolşärif Mosque was first constructed in the 16th century in the Muslim-dominated Khanate of Kazan. The people were decidedly different from ethnic Russians, and spoke the Tatar language and practiced Islam. Qolşärif was a massive place of worship in the town and was famed to be the largest mosque in Europe. Built early in the 16th century, the Mosque was a symbol of Tatar strength in the era. Unfortunately, Ivan the Terrible was gaining power throughout Russia, and eventually came to claim a toll from Kazan. In 1552, he stormed the city and destroyed the monumental mosque. After its fall, Kazan was swept into the larger Russian state, although the Tatar architecture was not all lost in the coming change. Some claim that Qolşärif’s soaring minarets influenced St. Basil’s Cathedral, where construction began only three years after the fall of Kazan. In 1996, a project began in Kazan to rebuild the Qolşärif Mosque as true to form as possible. Funded partly by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the final project was finished in 2005 and is a splendid wonder. With soaring teal-topped minarets and whitewashed arches, the new mosque connects the old Kazan Khanate with modern Russian and Islamic architecture, and serves to keep the memory of the 16th century mosque alive.",sacred spaces

One of his most audacious schemes involved conquering the natural world itself. He called it his “Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature.” The lynchpin of this endeavor was a doomed railway cutting through the heart of the Arctic, built by prisoners of the Soviet Gulag system. Stalin conceived of an 806-mile-long rail line to run between the Siberian cities Igarka and Salekhard. Between the years 1947 to 1953, political prisoners were tasked with turning two separate projects into one massive bad idea. Working from the banks on the River Ob prisoners constructing the 501 Railroad’s struggled to unite their project with that of a separate team of prisoners who were actively dying as they laid ties and rails on their 503 Railroad. On either side of the tracks, wooden barracks (also built by the very prisoners they once housed) can still be seen crumbling into the low brush of the tundra. As the years wore on, progress was made with ever increased sluggishness. Supervisors also started to realize that demand waiting on the other side for the completed railroad verged on nonexistent. When word reached the camps of Stalin’s death in 1953, all work on the tyrant’s insane pet project was put to an end, leaving the railway a simple straight line through the sparsely populated Arctic. To this day, the purpose of Stalin’s project remains dubious. Outwardly, the purpose was said to be one of transporting nickel between the two cities’ Arctic deep-water ports. Yet more likely, it seems the true idea behind Stalin’s railroad lay in creating pointless work for a large population of politically threatening individuals in order to decimate their numbers, all disguised as “serving the nation.” At no time in history did this massive stretch of rail connect to the rest of the Russian railway system, nor did it transport a single rail car — teeming with nickel or otherwise. No accurate record of prisoners’ death or injury was kept, meaning there is no way of knowing this impotent railway’s human cost. Over time, its official name, the Salekhard-Igarka Railway, has been eclipsed by the more succinct moniker “Death Road.”",prisons soviet history railroads trains infrastructure abandoned

The enormous artwork is the centerpiece of a wider memorial complex that commemorates the Battle of Stalingrad, one of the bloodiest battles in the history of warfare. Construction began on the massive monument in May 1959, and it was finally completed in October 1967. At the time, it was the tallest statue in the world. It has since lost that record, but remains the tallest statue in Europe and the tallest statue of a woman in the world. And this isn’t a woman you want to mess with, as she wields the world’s largest sword. Apart from the various records, “The Motherland Calls” is notable for being a beautifully dramatic sculpture. The sculpture depicts a woman stepping forward in an elegant but forceful manner, her left arm outstretched before her and her right raised high and wielding a mighty sword. It is a symbol of strength and determination, a call from the Motherland to never surrender and to maintain the attack until all enemies are defeated. From a technical point of view, it was a truly ambitious project. The posture alone was a hugely complicated issue, apart from the simple size of the thing. Pre-stressed concrete and wire ropes were used to achieve the dramatic stance and to help balance the statue with its outstretched arms. The exterior walls were made from concrete about 12 inches thick, and the interior was made from a series of separate chambers. In total, the statue is 279 feet tall from the tip of the sword to the top of the plinth. The female figure stands at an impressive 170 feet tall. The sword, meanwhile, is 108 feet long and made entirely of stainless steel. “The Motherland Calls” has had to cope with a couple of serious problems over the last half century. Not long after the statue was completed, it became apparent that the huge sword was potentially a massive problem. The weapon, which was originally trimmed with titanium sheets, was swaying in the wind, putting enormous stress on the statue’s arm and creating some highly disconcerting noises. The problem was resolved in 1972, when the blade was replaced by a new steel version without the titanium and with holes near the upper end to reduce the wind impact. More recently, a new problem emerged. The 8,000-ton statue isn’t actually connected to its foundations, but rather relies on its own weight to keep it in place and standing upright. In 2009, it was discovered that rising water levels were causing the foundations of the memorial to subside. At the time, an unnamed official told the BBC that the statue was already listing by around eight inches, and that it would probably collapse if the tilt increased much more. So far, however, thanks to some restoration work and perhaps a lot of luck, the world’s tallest woman, and the world’s largest sword, are still standing proudly above Volgograd.  ""The Motherland Calls"" is located on Mamayev Kurgan hill along Lenina Avenue in Volgograd, Russia. There are 200 steps leading up from the foot of the memorial complex to the base of the statue, representing the 200 days of the Battle of Stalingrad.",world's tallest war memorial women monuments statues
208,Whale Bone Alley,Russia,Siberian whale bones stand as cairns marking location of an ancient butcher yard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/whale-bone-alley,"Jutting out of the northern tip of Siberia’s remote Yttygran Island, giant whale ribs and vertebrae mark the area known as Whale Bone Alley, where once the great sea beasts were slaughtered and their meat stored by the local tribes. Consisting of hundreds of whale bones, mainly jawbones, ribs, and vertebrae, Whale Bone Alley is thought to have been created around 600 years ago by a cooperative group of native tribes. Many of the bones were placed in long rows along the shore giving the site its evocative name. In addition to the massive bones that were planted into the ground, a number of pits used for storing meat were found with fossilized whale bits still in them. The overall effect is of a haunting titan’s boneyard. Researchers and archaeologists believe that the site was established as a place of mutual worship and ritual for the united tribes. There seems to be the remains of a sacred site near the bottom of the “alley,” and the meat pits were believed to store food for the gathered tribesmen. However, this high-minded history of the site may simply be a case of seeing smoke without fire. The locals in the area, many of whom are descended from the civilizations which created the site believe that Whale Bone Alley was nothing more than a gathering place where hunters could come together and butcher their catch as a group. Whichever reading of the area’s history is correct, one thing is currently true of the site: tourists love it. The stunning bone formations have been luring more and more tourists from all over the world each year.",whales bones animals

Under dark grey winter skies, one might wonder where its nickname, “Golden Brains,” came from—perhaps the students admitted were exceptionally bright? But when the sun emerges, the reasoning becomes abundantly clear. Reflecting in the sunlight, the wiry brown twists and geometric turns atop the building shimmer gloriously, loosely resembling the mechanical workings of the mind. Construction of the 20-story academic tower began in the early 1970s, though it was first conceived in the 1960s. It consists of two closely spaced towers and lower buildings containing office space. The style is generally referred to as late Soviet modernism, and the unique tops are a beautiful example of contemporary design. However according to local legend, a former staff member at the building once said that people started experiencing unexplained headaches after its construction. This was followed by more extreme conspiracy theories that the bright metal rooftops were a state instrument for “zombifying” the residents of the capital city, transmitting signals to control the minds of the people.  There's a restaurant inside the ""brains"" on the 22nd floor. But expect to do it for the view. The food is rather pricey. The terrace is open all year long (catering only in summer; blankets are available). You can see some major landmarks like the Luzhniki stadium, Moscow University and the skyscrapers of Moscow City. The nearby Andreevsky monastery's bells can be heard from the terrace every hour. The low-rise part of the complex houses a 1,500 capacity concert hall, a winter garden and a courtyard.",conspiracy theories soviet architecture design architectural oddities art architecture

The family traces its lineage to second half of the 13th century. During these first centuries family changed the name several times. During the time of Ivan the Terrible, when their power begun to rise they were still known as Zakharin-Yuriev. The basis of operations for the powerful clan was this unassuming building in the so called Zaryadye in Moscow, very near but comfortably outside of Kremlin walls, and close to the merchants of Kitai Gorod district. Eventually in 1917, after over 300 years of rule, the Romanovs were lined up and killed by their own guards during the Russian revolution. In a bizarre scene, the younger Romanov girls were not killed by the shots as their corsets were stuffed with jewels which stopped the bullets, the guards attempted to stab them and thier bayonets glanced off the jewels. At this point the guards began to fear that the old legend of the Romanovs having supernatural powers and that controlled the throne by divine right was true. The guards finally shot the remaining Romonov girls in the head, and ended the Romanov rule of Russia.

Samara, renamed Kuybyshev in the honor of a Bolshevik leader in 1935, was designated as the USSR’s second capital city, in case Moscow fell to the German Army. The bunker was built in nine months by a team of 800 engineers and 2,900 workers who worked secretly around the clock. General opinion is that the construction crew was made up of convicts who were killed after completion of the bunker, though no proof has yet to be found. It is still a mystery how the workers and construction equipment went unseen by the locals. Presently located under the Academy of Culture and Skill, the bunker is 37 meters deep, which is the equivalent to a 12-story building. Compared to other bunkers of the time, this was the deepest. Hitler’s Berlin bunker was only 16 meters deep. The self-contained air recycling system and power station were still in working order upon discovery. The bunker could withstand a direct hit from an aerial bomb. It could be airtight and those inside could live for up to 5 days. The ground floor contains 2 rooms, the main chamber which could hold 115 people, and Stalin’s personal chamber. The upper levels held rooms for the guards, technical support staff and storage. Stalin never needed to stay at the bunker. It remained a secret to Samara citizens until 1991, when it was found, and later turned into a museum.",bunkers subterranean sites

Visitors that stumble across this unique corner of Saint Petersburg can listen to these strange sounds and even play some of the instruments—the ones that aren’t too loud. Among the musical creations on display is the “utyugon,” one of the first analog synthesizers in Russia. Created by experimentalist musicians in 1983, the instrument is a table with nailed guitar strings that have irons hung on them and knives stuck in the countertop. There were also guitar pickups on the top that sent signals to speakers. There’s the “smargachka,” a metallic washboard with many bells and whistles attached, and the sperophone, an electroacoustic instrument influenced by Tibetan bowls. Another instrument, created by a saxophonist, is the “contrabas” clarinet of sewer pipes. The mechanics of the instrument is a system of holes with wooden bungs. An ordinary mouthpiece of bass clarinet is used for playing that creates a low vibrating sound. The “chalice/grigson” is a set of metallic goblets and bowls with springs and strings attached. The sounds it creates are limited only by the player’s imagination. The museum also has an interactive map of Saint Petersburg, where you can scroll around and just listen to the unique soundscapes of different places around the city.

215,Lake Labynkyr,"Sakha Republic, Russia",This remote lake in Siberia supposedly contains a fearsome sea monster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-labynkyr,"Anything can happen in a fantasy monster match-up, but it’s probably safe to say that whatever lives under this deep, frigid Siberian lake could make mincemeat out of Nessie. Rumors around the Devil of Labynkyr have swirled since the 19th century, as an explanation for mysterious disappearances of people and livestock in the region. These whispers kicked into high gear following the testimony of Soviet scientist Victor Tverdokhlebova, who was certain he saw something on his 1953 expedition through Siberia. The creature he described was a watery behemoth, gray, with a large mouth and wide-set eyes. In 2012, sonar scans by Lyudmila Emeliyanova picked up a moving mass of around seven meters long, decidedly not a fish, decidedly not a log, but also decidedly hidden from view. The leading theory — at least among those convinced that there could be a massive creature in the lake — was that the monster was some kind of prehistoric marine reptile, like an ichthyosaur or plesiosaur. The other theory? Big fish, maybe a pike. In an attempt to get to the bottom of all of this, a group of scientists literally did go to the bottom (of the lake). Labynkyr is a deep one, around 53 meters on average. A 2013 joint expedition by the Russian Geographic Society and the Diving Sport Federation of Russia set a new ice diving record at 59.6 meters, taking samples along the way. Reporting on the expedition, the Voice of Russia indicated that the team also discovered a large jawbone and skeleton nestled in the lakebed, but no physical or photographic evidence of such a discovery has been shared. Whether it be a jumbo fish, a weird amphibian, a leftover dinosaur, or a collective delusion, hopefully, the truth will be revealed one day.",underwater week monsters lakes water
216,The Batagaika Crater,"Verkhoyanskiy ulus, Russia","The giant Siberian crater known locally as the ""doorway to the underworld"" is expanding every year.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-batagaika-crater-verkhoyanskiy-ulus-russia,"The largest crater in Siberia, known as “the doorway to the underworld” or a “mega slump” depending on who you ask, is getting larger and deeper each year—a trend that brings with it both foreboding and promise. The Batagaika crater first started to form as a result of deforestation in the area in the 1960s. Without the cooling effects of the trees, permafrost in the soil started to melt during warmer months, causing the soil to collapse and slump. As it melted, it released methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which increased the warming the area was experiencing, and caused deeper permafrost to melt and more soil to slump. The slumping of the soil resulted in a phenomenon called “drunken trees,” an inability of trees to grow straight. Thus, as the area got warmer, the ground was also less protected from the warming, resulting in more melting, and so on. For this reason, the crater continues to grow and has expanded by between 30 and 100 feet every year for the past 10 years, depending on how warm a given year was. It is currently 0.6 miles long and about 280 feet deep. The local Yakutian people, who gave it the nickname “the doorway to the underworld,” avoid the crater, but scientists are eager to study it. Scientists have nicknamed it the far less threatening “mega slump,” which is an enormous void that forms when permafrost rapidly thaws. The Batagaika crater is one of many mega slumps to appear recently in this area of Siberia; it is also the largest. It therefore offers many clues about the history and future of the area and of climate change. Scientists believe the sediment layers in the crater could reveal up to 200,000 years of Earth history. Two bands indicating epochs of dense forests have been found in the sides of the crater, one indicating a time when the area was open tundra. The carcasses of a mammoth, a musk ox, and a 4,400-year-old horse have also been uncovered by the melting of the permafrost. Evidence of the last time such craters opened up in the area—about 10,000 years ago at the end of Earth’s last ice age—and of what happened afterward give scientists an idea of what to expect and how to respond during this period of warming climate and melting permafrost.",craters climate change subterranean subterranean sites science
217,Borodino Panorama,"Moscow, Russia",A 360 degree battlefield experience.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/borodino-panorama,"The almost unimaginable carnage of the clash between the French and Russian forces at the Battle of Borodino is brought to life in a 360-degree masterpiece of panoramic art in Moscow, Russia. Nearly 380 feet of canvas painted by painted by Russian artist Franz Roubaud depict the fighting of 1812 in dramatic detail, attempting to bring alive the battle that raged between more than 250,000 troops and ended with an estimated 70,000 casualties. Sound effects of battle sounds add to the mood of the scene. Roubaud was born in Russia, but studied art in Munich. He went on to create a number of enormous panoramas of battle scenes including the Siege of Sevastopol and Russo-Persian War, and this depiction of the Battle or Borodino, which opened in Russia on August 29, 1912, in honor of the centennial of the fight. Panoramas were enormously popular throughout Europe and the United States in the 19th century, with epic battles being amongst the most popular subjects. Near the museum at a mass-grave memorial, visitors can pay their respects to 300 Russian soldiers who lost their lives in that battle. Although few full-scale panoramas of the hundreds that once lured crowds around the world still exist, there are a few notable survivors: In Wroclaw, Poland, the enormous 120-year-old Raclawice Panorama lets you step into the middle of the 1794 Battle of Racławice. In Istanbul, Turkey, the Panorma 1453 Museum recreates the epic fall of Constantinople. A more modern example in Damascas, Syria, the October War Panorama is dedicated to scenes from the 1973 October War between Israel, Egypt, and Syria.

218,Peter the Great Statue,"Moscow, Russia",One of the world's tallest statues is also one of its most hated.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peter-the-great-statue,"In this gigantic statue, Peter the Great stands proudly atop a tower of ships, clutching a golden scroll in his hand. He looks like a poised, triumphant ruler ready to conquer the seas. But unfortunately, this statue can’t even conquer the public’s approval. Moscow locals aren’t a fan of the behemoth work of art. Nor, it seems, is anyone else for that matter. The statue has been frequently voted among the ugliest buildings and statues in the world. At 322 feet tall—it’s the eighth tallest statue in the world—the tribute to the great Russian leader is viewed as more of an enormous riverside eyesore than a fitting tribute to a legendary emperor. In fact, the not-so-great statue may not have even been made to honor Peter the Great at all. According to one prominent rumor, it was actually created as a tribute to Christopher Columbus to mark the 500th anniversary of his first voyage. According to this version of its origin story, sculptor Zurab Tsereteli couldn’t find an American buyer for the work, so his friend and former mayor of Moscow commissioned the piece. It was reworked to represent the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy Peter the Great founded and was finally erected in 1997. The people of Moscow aren’t thrilled they wound up with the statue—after all, Peter the Great disliked the city so much he moved Russia’s capital to Saint Petersburg. It’s been proposed to relocate the monumental effigy to the emperor’s favored city, but so far Saint Petersburg has kindly declined that offer.  The monument stands facing southwest, with its back to the Bolotny island (Balchug). You can see it from either bank of the river, with Muzeon Park (part of Gorky Park) on the right and Prechistenskaya embankment on the left. It can be easily combined with other sights like Christ the Savior's Cathedral or Tretyakov Gallery. Highly recommend a river boat cruise on Moskva River.

Entirely encircled by Italy, this little country historically protected itself from invasion, siege and attack by retreating inside these walls, which include an old prison with some 19th century “outsider art.” Some of the castle structures at Guaita date as far back as the 10th and 11th centuries, but the prison isn’t quite that old. The tower is open to visitors, and here you can see recently discovered prisoner graffiti that had been hidden under layers and layers of whitewash for the past 200 or more years. The work ranges from scribbles to soldiers, with some geometric patterns and fair maidens popping up too. And there are some far more expressive – and sometimes bizarre – figures that may have been inspired by the less-than-homey conditions. Of all the images, one man in particular gets a good deal of wall space, but it’s a mystery who the man is. He’s bearded with curly hair and small mustache, always in profile, and looks alternately like Abe Lincoln or Bradley Cooper in American Hustle. Whether he was a prisoner or a guard, or just someone famous in the day, that one face got a lot of attention. The prison was closed in 1970, and it has a long and dark history going back to the late middle ages. The graffiti, on the other hand, looks positively modern when compared to those old medieval walls. San Marino is what they call a ""microstate"", a small republic surrounded by Italy.

Lacking a doctrine, it’s more a traditional culture rather than a strict religion for most Japanese people. Reportedly there are over 88,000 Shinto shrines in Japan, so spotting one in the country is rather easy, as most neighborhoods have a jinja (“shrine”) of their own. There are also several Shinto shrines across the globe, particularly in former Japanese colonies such as Taiwan, Palau, and Saipan, as well as in Brazil and Hawaii, where many Japanese people migrated to during the early 20th- century. Europe has a few shrines, although only one of them has been officially sanctioned by Japan’s Association of Shrines. In the heart of San Marino, a tiny republic enclosed by Italy, a Shinto shrine was established in 2014 to commemorate the 20,000 lives lost in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Funded by the San Marino-Japan Friendship Society, it was constructed in the Shinmei-zukuri style partially using the wood of the Ise Grand Shrine. Its main subject of worship is Amaterasu, the sun goddess and a major deity in the Shinto pantheon. The shrine’s inauguration was attended by 150 people, including several Japanese officials such as the president of the Association of Shrines, the chief priest of Iwashimizu Hachimangū Shrine, and the mother of the prime minister.

The third tower, known as Montale, is the smallest and most recent of the three fortifications. It was constructed during the 14th-century after some earlier structures were renovated. In 1320, it was connected to the other two towers by a wall. The fort was initially used as a watchtower during the wars against the Malatesta family that ruled the surrounding area. A bell inside the tower was used to indicate to the population that a threat was imminent. The tower was also used as a prison with the only entrance being a few feet from the ground, making it impossible to access this area of the interior from ground level. After the destruction of the Malatestian fort of Fiorentino in 1479, the Montale was abandoned. It was subsequently restored in 1743, 1817, and 1935. Currently, the interior of the tower cannot be accessed by the public, but the view that can be enjoyed from the peak is worth the trek to the base of the tower.  The base of the tower is a short rocky scramble from the path. The top path between the towers has some vertiginous drops. The lower path is slightly easier.
