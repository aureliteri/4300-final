0,The Corner House,"Riga, Latvia",A former Latvian headquarters of the brutal KGB secret police is now open as a grim reminder of their atrocities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-corner-house-riga-latvia,"The lovely Art Nouveau building in center of the Latvian capital of Riga is actually a former KGB headquarters known as The Corner House, where political prisoners would be taken and subject to torture and worse. The city of Riga came under Soviet control in 1940, and the brutal new leaders brought with them the dreaded KGB secret police. Setting up shop in the Corner House, a secretive headquarters in the middle of the city, the KGB began summoning people to uncertain fates within the depths of the building. “Undesirable Elements” could be picked up for crimes as small as having “anti-Soviet conversations” or “instigating panic.” Many of the people captured by the KGB were executed in a killing area in the basement of the Corner House. Still others were crammed into cells with dozens of other prisoners, and made to sweat and go mad with thirst as the basement was kept at around 85 degrees. When the Nazis drove the Soviets out of Riga during World War II, they opened the doors of the secretive house to garner trust from the population by showing them the horrors the Soviets had created. After the war, the Germans left the country and the Soviets came right back, continuing the secret police practices as they had before. Latvia finally regained its independence in 1991, and the Corner House was simply closed off so that the country could move on. In 2012 some of the space was reopened as a museum and visitors can now see first hand, the secretive headquarters of the brutal KGB. Most of the official documents are still kept hidden away, but just being able to see the location itself is a haunting reminder of a dark period in the city’s history.",secret police kgb secret world war ii military museums and collections museums
1,Riga Central Market,"Riga, Latvia","3,000 market stands in five former Zeppelin hangars.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zeppelin-hangers-turned-markets,"At the turn of the 20th century, Zeppelins were seen as the transportation of the future. During that time, five giant hangars were created to house the German-made airships in the center of Riga, Latvia. When Zeppelins fell out of use, a move to convert the hangars was proposed, and the hangars were turned into Europe’s largest market bazaar. Built in stunning Neoclassical and Art Deco style, the market spans an area of 778,000 square feet and houses 3,000 trade stands. Farmers and craftsman set up hundreds of tables there hawking their wares, only slowed by the Nazi and Soviet occupations that came during the next 60 years. During the Nazi occupation, the market was almost completely shut down to house troops and supplies for the army. However, the market was re-invigorated under the Soviets, who took credit for the Riga Central Market, claiming it was a stunning example of a successful market in the Soviet Union.",architectural oddities architecture
2,Art Nouveau in Riga,"Riga, Latvia",Flamboyant architecture from the turn of 20th century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/art-nouveau-riga,"Art Nouveau or Jugendstil (as it was known in German influenced countries) was a style in decorative arts which marked the turn of 20th century. It originated in France but quickly spread throughout Europe often merging with local artistic tendencies. It left a trail of iconic examples of design, from Paris metro stations and works of Victor Horta in Brussels to Helsinki main railway station and secessionist buildings in Budapest. Latvian capital boasts one the most extensive assortment of pure Art Nouveau buildings in Europe. There are over 800 Art Nouveau buildings scattered all over Riga’s historic center. The most striking examples can be found along Elizabetes Iela and Alberta. These include buildings by Mikhail Eisenstein the father of the famous director Sergei Eisenstein.

3,The Three Brothers,"Riga, Latvia",The oldest housing complex in Riga is a mini timeline of architectural trends.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-three-brothers-riga-latvia,"According to local lore, the bond that binds these adjacent buildings, dubbed the “three brothers,” goes deeper than just their names and location. Supposedly, they were all built by descendants of the same family. Whether or not that is true, the “brothers” stand next to one another as a striking timeline of architectural trends. The first brother, which was built in the late 15th century, is among the oldest dwellings in all of Riga. The building features impressive Gothic and Dutch influences, all crowned by an intricate set of crow-stepped gables. It was originally used as one large room; a bustling little hub for manufacturing, trade, and everyday life. The middle brother is a pleasant shade of mellow yellow, though its pale color doesn’t mean it’s a structure to be overlooked. This building, arguably the architecturally grandest and most eye-catching one, was built in the mid-17th century. It, too, features Dutch influences thanks to the city’s trade relationship with the Netherlands. The house boasts intricate details including an engraving above the door that reads, “Soli Deo gloria!” (“Glory to God alone!” in Latin). The youngest brother came along shortly after the middle one. It was built in the later half of the 17th century and is the thinnest of the trio. Its green facade is allegedly meant to be a mask to protect the property from evil spirits. Amazingly, pedestrians are invited to step inside the historic dwelling, as it happens to house the Latvian Museum of Architecture. The museum gives visitors an inside look (literally) at the gorgeous house, as well as a peek at the blueprints and drafts of other architectural marvels throughout the city.",houses homes architectural oddities museums architecture
4,Bridge to Nowhere,"Irlavas pagasts, Latvia",A railway bridge leading nowhere stands lonely in the middle of a meadow.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bridge-to-nowhere-latvia,"In the middle of the Latvian countryside is an unusual structure bound to pique the curiosity of anyone who happens upon it. The “Tilts uz nekurieni,” or “Bridge to Nowhere,” is a narrow-gauge railway bridge leading nowhere at all, surrounded on both ends by nothing but a lush green meadow. The concrete span across the Abava River, just 180 feet long (55 meters), was built in 1940, intended to be part of the new Tukums-Kuldiga rail line that was under construction. It was one of a number of ambitious projects planned by the newly independent and quickly developing republic of Latvia. Then World War II broke out. With the nation at war, the railway line was never finished. The high costs of civil engineering and construction are a major consideration in building any railroad. As these activities require specialized equipment and personnel, it is not uncommon to have these portions of a project completed ahead of the general track laying. The abandoned bridge still stands intact, a strange sight in the Irlavas village, near Sāti. To many locals, the lonely Bridge to Nowhere also represents a wartime memorial of sorts. It commemorates the failed effort made by the Germans to continue the bridge during the Nazi occupation of Latvia in the early 1940s. The unique structure may serve no practical purpose, but it belongs to Latvia alone.",nazis railroads trains infrastructure bridges world war ii abandoned military
5,Black Cat of Riga,"Riga, Latvia",A black cat protests the City Guild in Riga's Old Town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/black-cat-on-roof,"Getting into the Great Guild in Latvia in the 14th century, was an incredibly huge honor. Similarly, getting snubbed from the Great Guild was a gigantic insult. One Riga local was so offended that he attached a black cat on top of his building so it would cast its evil glare upon the Guild for as long as the building would stand. With an arched back, the Black Cat of Riga seems ready to strike and clearly states the man’s displeasure at not getting admitted to the Guild. Obviously, the members of the guild hated the sculpture, and a fight between the man and the guild raged for months to come. Although an agreement was reached and the statue turned around, the Black Cat still sits on its perch in Old Town Riga.  Riga's Old Town, Meistaru street 10/12",cats statues animals
6,Liepaja Northern Forts,"Liepāja, Latvia",These crumbling Latvian forts make for some haunting seaside ruins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/liepaja-northern-forts,"Crumbling away on the edge of the Latvian coast, a row of abandoned concrete bunkers have formed a lovely line of ruins that harken back to a fort built by Tzarist Russia. When they were created, the ruins encircled the entire city of Liepaja. The Northern Forts were part of Liepaja’s central fortress and they were built between the 19th and 20th century to provide shelter to the naval base. A line of outer fortifications surrounded the whole city. However, in 1908, after less than ten years of construction, the whole fortress was considered a strategic misstep and it was abandoned. There were attempts to blow up parts of it, but destroying such robust fortifications is no easy feat, and the remains still stand today. Surprisingly, the efforts to destroy the forts had the effect of creating haunting seaside ruins. Each little stone bunker holds its own secrets. Achieving what man’s powerful explosives could not, the sea has started to take its toll and part of the Northern Forts complex has collapsed to the waterline. This has made it a popular place for youngsters to climb in and around these broken bunkers. The bunkers run along the coast and can be accessed via Krasta street, Koknese street or Jatnieku street.",bunkers military history military ruins
7,Cinevilla,"Slampe, Latvia",Spend the night in 1920s Latvia in this historic recreation and movie set.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cinevilla,"Built in 2004 as the set for “Defenders of Latvia,” Cinevilla is a strange mix of historic recreation and Hollywood-esque fantasy world. Spanning over 370 acres in total, the complex has all the features of early 20th century Latvia, including a small town, a city resembling Riga and typical Latvian farmland. Down to every last detail, the ghost town movie set spared no expense. Three bridges cross a man-made river, which also features a steamship replica, harkening back to turn-of-the century Riga. When movies are not being filmed on the cobbled streets of Cinevilla, visitors are invited to wander the town and even spend the night. During the summer, Cinevilla can accommodate 46 visitors in 12 cabins overnight for the full 1900s Riga experience. Along with a tour of the set area, tourists can patronize the on-site Latvian pub and even watch bread be made at the local bakery.

8,Ligatne Secret Soviet Bunker,"Ligatne, Latvia",A top secret Cold War bunker hidden beneath a Latvian spa facility is now open for tours.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ligatne-secret-soviet-bunker,"Deep beneath Latvia’s “Ligatne” rehabilitation centre, a sort of spa centre, is a well-equipped facility that was built to protect the Soviet political elite in case of a less-relaxing nuclear attack. Planning for the hidden stronghold actually began in the late 1960s, but the Soviet facility was not completed until 1982. A sanatorium was built as though nothing was unusual about it, but unbeknownst even to the workers at the rehabilitation center, the site held a number of secrets. Buried 30 feet beneath the building above, the bunker was a powerful, autonomous, self-sustaining structure filled with state-of-the-art-of-the-day equipment and supplies. The 213,000 square foot hideout could support 250 people for up to three months in the case of a nuclear attack, and was protected beneath layers of dirt, cement, and metal plate. The plan was for the Soviet leadership in Latvia to retreat to the bunker should anyone drop the bomb. The bunker wasn’t the only secret on the grounds either. A shallow reflecting pool in front of the spa building was actually a hidden helipad, and another was camouflaged as a basketball court. The Soviets called the secret redoubt, Pansionat, The Pention House. Since it was a military defense structure, the bunker reverted to the Latvian Ministry of Defense after the Soviet regime ended. When Latvia joined NATO, the secret defense did not measure up to NATO s standards and the site was taken out of military control. Thanks to this abandonment by the military, the bunker was left in its original condition, with all of the old equipment and decoration that it originally had. The former secret facility was opened to the public in 2003, and can now enter the strange Stalinist halls that look like they have not only been protected from radiation, but time as well. The bunker is up in the forested area of Skalupes.",bunkers secret cold war hidden military
9,Castle of Light,"Riga, Latvia",Latvia's symbolic mountain-shaped national library is home to millions of cultural tomes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-of-light,"In Latvian literature and folklore, a “castle of light” is a metaphor for lost wisdom that can be reclaimed after the people overcome the symbolic darkness of war, invasion, and occupation. It comes from an old legend in which a mystical castle symbolizing culture and knowledge sinks in a lake but will one day be rebuilt. It’s thus a fitting name for the striking modern structure that now houses the cultural archives of the former Soviet-occupied nation. The Castle of Light, as the National Library of Latvia (Latvijas Nacionālā bilbiotēka) is locally known, was opened in 2014 on the banks of the Daugava River. The building, designed by Latvian-American architect Gunnar Birkerts, is shaped like a large mountain with a glass flame atop the structure. The glass flame makes up the 11th and 12th floors and offers a magnificent panorama of Old Town Riga on the river. The library includes an open space in the center of the building that allows visitors to look up at floors of books, manuscripts, sheet music, and other cultural treasures. The space claims to house more than 1,000 places to read, and shelf space for more than six million items. There is also an auditorium, gift shop, and excellent cafe. A permanent exhibition takes a look at both the history of books in Latvia and how these works have shaped and influenced the Latvian culture. The major collections focus on items in Latvian or about the country and its people, including children’s literature, science, technology, music, and cartography.  Information on visiting is available on the library website, but as of July 2018 visitors can explore portions of the library daily, although levels 11 and 12 are only open on Saturdays. Stop at the welcome desk to register for the visit. Tours are also available and can be set up through the library for a small per person fee.",archive culture maps libraries books music collections architecture
10,Pokaini Forest,"Naudītes Pagasts, Latvia",Mysterious heaps of stones dot these otherworldly woods.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pokaini-forest,"Strange clusters of stones freckle this Latvian forest. People have been drawn into these woods for ages, lured by the mysterious rocks and their alleged powers. But unusual rock heaps remain unexplained. One proposed reason for their existence is that the stones may have been gathered centuries ago to build a castle that never materialized. This, however, would be hard to prove, as there are no records of such activities in the area. A more mundane explanation is that people gathered them while clearing the fields for farming. But this still wouldn’t explain why they plunked them in various piles so deep in the forest. People have attributed special powers to the stones. Some consider the forest to be a healing center or an old pagan sanctuary, and it’s now frequented by psychics and channelers to boost their energetic charges. Some visitors claim the stones have an uplifting and energizing effect. People will sometimes bring offerings to enhance the stones’ powers. Others treat this place with caution and consider it to be a haunted area, or even a gateway to a parallel world. There are rumors that some people have died or otherwise suffered soon after visiting the forest. It’s said that taking the stones from the woods and bringing them home is dangerous.  You need your own transportation to visit the place. The area is large with different footpaths in many locations. You can get a map from the visitor's center, drive to the forest, make stops on the parking areas and hike along the footpaths from there. If you plan to visit all the locations and footpaths, plan to be there for around four or five hours.",rock formations forests intriguing environs legends geological oddities ecosystems geology
11,The Venta Rapid,"Kuldīga, Latvia",The widest waterfall in Europe is a natural wonder and one of the only places where fish are caught in the air.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-venta-rapid-kuldiga-latvia,"The Venta Rapid is the widest waterfall in Europe, spanning a width of 650-820 feet (200-250 meters) depending on the season. However, if you’re picturing something along the lines of Niagara Falls or Iguazu Falls you will be very surprised. The height of this Latvian waterfall is only about 6 feet (less than 2 meters). Thanks to its relatively squat height, the Venta Rapid (Ventas rumba in Latvian) is much less well-known than Europe’s famous drops. But it is no less a natural wonder. Visitors can enjoy walking along the width of the waterfall and even bathing in it. In spring and autumn, when spawning fish migrate upstream, you can watch from the banks as flying fish try to jump over the rapid. Around 300 years ago, the Duke of Courland invented a technique to catch up to 100 salmon a day using baskets placed all along the waterfall. The neighbouring town, Kuldiga, grew in size as fishermen were drawn to the site. Today, Kuldiga is a beautiful town worth wandering around to admire its views of the waterfall and its quaint buildings. And it’s able to boast that it’s the only place in Europe where fish are caught right in the air. An impressive brick bridge, built in 1874, runs parallel to the waterfall and is an excellent place to admire the site. You may get more than you bargained for if you go in summer though: the Race of the Naked is an annual tradition that takes place on midsummer nights.",fishing waterfalls fish natural wonders water nature

In the summer, when the grass grows tallest, they’re difficult to spot. The Mazirbe boat cemetery is located in a forest near the seaside of Mazirbe, Dundaga County. Years ago, many of these boat cemeteries were built across the coast of the Baltic Sea. But nowadays, this graveyard is the only one of its kind in the area. The boats have been here since the 1960s and ’70s, when the discarded vessels were abandoned in the woods. Sadly, their time here appears to be running short, as the wooded graveyard is expected to be lost in about 10 years as nature continues reclaiming the site. Visiting the boat cemetery makes for an interesting walk along the seaside, complete with a touch of history. On a trail, you’ll spot wooden poles with barbed wire. These are markers of a time when the area was closed and civilian movement was restricted.  You can visit the boats free of charge.",boats cemeteries abandoned

In its day the sweeping complex was well guarded and isolated from rest of the city, creating a kind of city inside a city: Occupying 2 square miles, the fortress includes 10 streets and some 80 buildings. Daugavpils is located near the border of Lithuania, Belarus and Russia, and the majority of the city’s population speaks Russian. The mighty fortress was originally a Russian military outpost. Plans for the fortress were first laid out in 1772 by Russian Tsar Alexander I, and construction started in 1810 in anticipation of Napoleon’s attack on the Russian Empire.  Two years later the fortress successfully repelled Napoleon’s army. Although the official count states that more than 1,000 people could live inside the premises, most of the complex is now abandoned and looks like a ghost town. The complex is closed off, but you can find your way and sneak in to many of the abandoned houses, barracks and old hospital. You can also observe and walk on the old bastions, moats and ramparts, and a former Soviet military academy on the premises. Today all these places are perfect for urban exploring. The status of the whole complex might change in the nearby future as some of the buildings have already been restored and given a new function (Mark Rothko Art Center is now located in one of the buildings). Still, according to locals the city government has no particular plan of what to do with this piece of history and most of the buildings are still awaiting their fate.",fortresses forts abandoned
16,House of the Blackheads,"Riga, Latvia",The reconstruction of this prominent building fulfilled a long-written command.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-the-blackheads,"For centuries, the House of the Black Heads has stood at the heart of old town Riga, dominating the Riga Town Hall Square. However, this impressive building has humbler beginnings. Constructed in 1334, the building was originally known as the New House and its appearance was of a common medieval building. The structure underwent several reconstructions over the centuries resulting in the magnificent example of architecture that stands today. The design, in particular the opulent Dutch Renaissance façade, features various architectural styles and artistic trends covering various periods. The House of Black Heads was designed as a venue for meetings and banquets hosted by the Brotherhood of Blackheads; a guild of unmarried merchants, shipowners, and foreigners residing in Riga. The house was known for its wild parties and the Brotherhood is credited with displaying the first public Christmas tree in 1510. A stone marker outside the building marks the location. This building was one of the town’s many structures damaged or destroyed during World Wat II bombardments. The only surviving section was a medieval cellar discovered during the building’s reconstruction in the mid-1990s. The House of the Blackheads was fully restored in 1999. The House of the Blackheads now plays host to a museum and has a grand ballroom used for cultural events. Items on display include those that once belonged to the Brotherhood of Blackheads. The presidential residence for the president of Latvia was temporarily located in the building from 2012 to 2016. The re-building of House of the Blackheads fulfilled a saying once written on the building’s entrance: “Should I ever crumble to dust, rebuild my walls you must”.

Today, guards still walk Karosta’s halls and courageous people occupy its cells—even though the prison has been obsolete for decades. Prisoners have been replaced by tourists looking for an authentic jail experience in the form of a “boutique hotel.” On a visit to Karosta, visitors can take a quick guided tour, or opt for the full Karosta experience, which includes prisoner garb, interrogation, harassment and, finally, being locked into a cold cell for a night literally in prison. Before embarking on the full prison experience, tourists are made aware that disobedience in the prison could result in insult or even physical punishment by means of exercise or cleaning. They are then required to sign an agreement. Be warned: Not all of the guards are completely fluent in English, and American visitors are often surprised by the amount of abuse they receive. Other than its living inhabitants, Karosta Prison is said to house the spirits of many who died within its walls.

You can walk its considerable length all the way to the end, where there’s a surreal view of the surrounding harbor as the mainland shrinks from sight. The North Pier is part of Karosta, a ruined fortress in Liepaja leftover from Tsarist and Soviet Russia. It’s a huge system of countless bunkers, cannons, and other defenses, that once housed some 20,000 people. The giant breakwater pier was constructed to protect the area from storm waves, fortified with concrete tripods. The military town was created in 1890 by Tsar Alexander III to defend against the neighboring German Empire. But in an instance of extremely unfortunate timing, the fort was destroyed after a friendly treaty was signed between Russia and Germany right before World War I pitted the countries against each other yet again. Today, Karosta is a collection of highly interesting remnants of the Soviet era. The remains of the fort have been eroded and worn down even more by the sea, resulting in an eerie landscape of many empty, dark bunkers and underground passages you can enter and explore. Several years ago, it was still possible to drive to the end of the pier, but today you can only explore on foot. For the first few hundreds of feet you can see many fishermen trying their luck. The last stretch becomes harder to traverse, as the pier becomes more and more eroded. But once you have made it to the end you will be rewarded with incredible views of the ruins of Karosta.",storms bunkers forts soviet history war history abandoned military ruins
19,Ventspils International Radio Astronomy Center,"Irbene, Latvia",This impressively complicated radioastronomy research center was once a tool of Soviet spies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ventspils-international-radio-astronomy-center,"On the Latvian coast of the Baltic Sea, the Soviet Army had an incredible secret weapon in a top secret location—The RT-32, also known as the Irbene Radar. The top secret location of the RT-32 was referred to as The Starlet, a covert base “hiding” the massive radio telescope that weighed in as the eighth largest in existence. Along with its daintier counterpart the RT-16, this massive parabolic centimetre-wave range antenna was built by the Ukraine Navy and installed by the Soviet military for your typical spy stuff—listening in on NATO countries and intercepting radio signals.It’s name referring to its giant, 32-meter antenna, the 600-ton RT-32 somehow escaped notice until 1993, when the Soviet Army withdrew when Lativia won its independence. Wasting no time, the Latvian Academy of Sciences moved in to commandeer the monolithic telescope in the name of science. Unfortunately, the Soviets didn’t leave The Starlet or its technological treasures untouched. Before their departure they made sure to destroy as much equipment as possible, and dumping acid onto any working motors and smashing anything within reach. Luckily, no order was given to completely destroy the antenna dishes, and the Latvian Academy was able to restore the radio telescopes and put them to a more beneficial and likely more exciting use. Now, instead of eavesdropping on dignitaries arguing in boardrooms, the mighty telescope peers into the vast expanse of outer space, assisting astronomers in observing the mighty day star, poking around space debris, and keeping an eye out for intelligent life. No longer a fancy military spy gadget, the RT-32 can be visited by civilians and explored on guided tours, although they are currently suspended until 2015 due to renovations. The Starlet, once a super-secret spy hideout, is now the prestigious Ventspils International Radio Astronomy Center with panoramic views and underground passageways to explore. Regardless of the temporary hold on guided tours, one can still enter the grounds and drive around the site, still an urban exploration favorite. Existing somewhere between ruin and restoration, the high-tech astronomy center is juxtaposed against the remaining abandoned Soviet apartment buildings and military posts, an excellent photo opportunity and the last chance to view the extraordinary telescope with the surrounding remnants of its espionage days.  daylight hours are best.",radio telescopes retro-tech soviet history space exploration military history military
20,First-Ever Public Christmas Tree Marker,"Riga, Latvia",A stone marker and sculpture in the city of Riga stake a claim for the very first community Christmas tree.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/first-ever-public-christmas-tree-marker,"When something happened over 500 years ago, it can be tricky to parse out fact from legend. Take the first ever Christmas tree. The custom of a decorated tree at Yuletide dates back centuries, to at least the 15th or 16th century. That much is fact, the very first one? The Christmas tree that started it all? That might be more a matter of legend. A likely candidate was in the medieval city of Riga, the capital of Latvia. Riga’s City Center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, including the Town Hall Square. Flanking the south side of the Square is the House of the Brotherhood of the Blackheads, and it’s here where the Christmas tree story takes shape. Near the northwest corner of the ornate building is a slightly domed stone marker embedded in the cobblestones, staking its claim—in eight languages—as the spot of the first public Christmas tree. The Brotherhood of the Blackheads was a guild of professional merchants and traders that banded together in the 14th century, and remained active in Latvia and Estonia right up through the middle of the 20th century. They were known for their twice-yearly holiday celebrations, including the Christmas to New Years season. It’s said that the Brotherhood put a fir tree in the square, festooned it with paper flowers, sang and danced and cheered the season, then lit the whole thing on fire. (Needless to say, it is also said that more than a few glasses were raised by the Brothers during the celebration.). The Brotherhood has documentation showing that this all happened for the first time in 1510, and it just might be the very first documented Christmas tree. The chapter in Tallin, 175 miles to the north in Estonia, makes the same claim for the same Christmas. Given the chummy relationship between the two chapters, it’s not inconceivable that they lit up their trees simultaneously. A Christmas tree still goes up in Riga’s Town Hall Square, in the same spot, in front of the same Brotherhood, but with a whole lot more lights and decorations. And that much is fact.  The marker is imbedded in the cobblestones of Riga's Town Hall Square, between the NE corner of the Museum of the Occupation and the NW corner of the House of the Black Heads. At Christmas time there is a decorated tree at the spot. The rest of the year a metal tree sculpture covers the spot.",holidays with a twist 2022 christmas holidays legends history
21,Jauniela (New Street),"Riga, Latvia",This charming Latvian lane doubled as Baker Street on the Soviet Union’s version of Sherlock Holmes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jauniela,"Any Londoner suddenly picked up and dropped down into the Old Town of Latvia’s capital would realize pretty quickly that they were not at home. But for viewers across the Soviet Union, Jauniela (literally New Street), a narrow cobbled street in the heart of Riga’s Old Town, was Baker Street, home of the world’s most famous fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. The Baltic states, and Riga in particular, were popular filming destinations for Soviet directors. This was largely due to their architectural heritage, which was quite different from Russia and most of the other Soviet republics, as a history of domination not only by Russia, but also by Germans, Swedes, and Poles had left these countries with a wealth of Gothic and Baroque architecture that meant they were often reminiscent of countries farther west. For Soviet directors who wanted to represent Western European cities in their work but for whom actually filming there would have been difficult to impossible, the Baltic capitals were obvious fall-backs. But it is the television series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson that is most indelibly associated with Riga. In its opening scenes, Holmes is seen marching home, accompanied by Watson, along a decidedly un-Victorian-looking Jauniela. Still thought of in Russia as one of the best TV series ever made, a total of 11 episodes were filmed between 1979 and 1986. It’s a testament to a long history of Russian obsession with the great detective, extending from the huge popularity of translations of Arthur Conan Doyle’s original stories at the turn of the century (as well as spin-offs by local writers that had Holmes solving cases in various Russian towns and cities) to the more recent mania for Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC series Sherlock. Regarded as perhaps the most faithful of all cinematic adaptations of Conan Doyle’s stories, it’s even won fans in Holmes’s home country: Vasily Livanov, the Russian actor who played Sherlock in the Soviet version, was awarded an MBE by the Queen in 2006. And Riga has recently started to make the most of its unlikely association with the famous literary character. Since 2011, the city has celebrated Sherlock Holmes’ birthday on January 8th, with enthusiasts attending in period costume, and more than a few pipes and deerstalkers present. Nearby, on Mazā Monētu iela, the Sherlock Art Hotel offers 17 rooms, all named after and themed on individual Holmes mysteries.  Jauniela is right in the middle of Riga Old Town and be reached by foot within a few minutes from all of the main sights. Riga also stood in for Stockholm in the crime film Unfinished Supper, for 19th-century France in The Prisoner of Château D’If (a Soviet adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo) and a fantasy land in a 1967 version of The Snow Queen.",movie sets soviet history film locations film
22,Riga Aviation Museum,"Skulte, Latvia",A vast and unlikely aviation museum kept alive for over 50 years due to one man's tenacity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/riga-aviation-museum,"Thanks to Victor Talpa, interested parties from all over the world are free to wander amidst the ghosts of aviation’s past while being buzzed by shiny, lumbering jets cruising into Riga International airport. Young aviation engineer Victor Talpa established the Riga Aviation Museum in 1956. In its early days, Talpa’s employment and subsequent partnership with the Latvian Civil Aviation Administration aided the development of resources and programming culminating in one of the most unique aircraft collections in Europe. On the grounds of the fledgling museum, Talpa established the Young Pilots’ Club where teen boys interested in aviation theory and mechanics could take lessons and complete basic physical training in preparation for being able to operate the aircraft of their dreams. Eventually Talpa pled his case that the Young Pilots should have their own plane, rather than a loaner aircraft supplied by the Latvian government. This first airplane–a Mig-21US–became the founding piece of the museum’s collection, with over forty military helicopters and planes of all stripes accumulating over the years. After the dissolution of the USSR, the museum was taken over by the Riga Airport Administration, which continued to provide the museum with the physical space necessary to all those classic planes and helicopters. By 1997 the Riga Aviation Museum had been fully privatized, its grounds opened up to the general public. Everything is stored outdoors and may not be in tip-top condition, but most impressive is that Victor Talpa has managed to preserve one of the most treasured collections of its kind for more than half a century despite all odds.",aviation soviet history museums and collections

A museum in Riga showcases more than 300 varieties of headdresses, the result of one man’s extensive travels. Russian anthropologist and linguist Doctor Kirill Babaev began collecting traditional headwear from different countries in 2002. The very first piece he bought was a woven Thai hat bejeweled with coins, shells, and silver. Many of his purchases were hand-made and often procured from the hat-wearer themselves. The museum came into being in 2014, when his extensive assortment began to take up so much space it needed a separate home. Now, in a quiet Riga apartment, showcased across five halls and divided according to region, is one of the largest collections of headwear in the world. Jeweled crowns, African helmet masks, bonnets made from human hair, and headdresses produced specially for occasions like weddings are but some of the pieces on display. Each represents a distinct culture of hat wearing, some of which are slowly dying out. The stories behind each exhibit are explained with signs which also feature a picture of the headdress being worn in its place of origin. Many of the pieces can be tried on, and the museum also organizes hat-making lectures and classes in Latvian, Russian, and English. Need to ring #12 at the front door to be buzzed in.

The monkey depicted in the sculpture is known as “Sam” and is a tribute to the animals who died during spaceflight survival tests. The former Soviet Union used a variety of animals for space missions during 195os and 1960s. During this period, it’s believed 42 animal cosmonauts were rocketed into the stratosphere. Practically all died during these tests either from fear and stress, or asphyxiation. Initially, “Sam” was exhibited in Kronvalda park in Riga during a sculpture festival in 2016. Latvians were so fond of the sculpture that after the festival concluded, it was moved to a residential area where it can be viewed today.",space exploration statues animals history
25,Stone Head of Salaspils,"Riga, Latvia",This enigmatic artifact remained buried in a churchyard for years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-head-of-salaspils,"Not much is known about the history of this strange stone. A farmer found it while plowing a field one day in 1851. He brought the stone, along with some others, to a stone mason. After realizing the rock was carved to resemble a human head, the stonemason sent it to the museum at the Riga Cathedral. Though museum records prove the stone was once in its possession, the enigmatic artifact later went missing for a period. It was eventually unearthed during churchyard excavations in 2000. Today, it’s displayed alongside other archaeological artifacts in church’s outside yard. The stone’s origins are as unclear as its unusual past. It’s believed an iron tool was used to carve human facial features into the 36-inch-tall (93 centimeters) boulder. It’s also believed the rock is a religious idol, similar to other stone figures associated with past Baltic cultures, such as the Old Prussian Hags of Northern Pomerania. Given its likely pagan association, some claim the rock was intentionally buried within the churchyard because of the church’s intolerance for such idols.  The head is on a display in the inside yard of Dome Church, along with some archeological and historic objects.",artifacts objects of intrigue rocks archaeology geology
26,Saint Nicholas Naval Cathedral,"Liepāja, Latvia","This ornate church has survived Nazi and Soviet occupation, including a short stint as a Soviet-era gymnasium and cinema.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saint-nicholas-naval-cathedral,"Just north of Liepāja in Latvia, the Saint Nicholas Naval Cathedral, an ornate Russian Orthodox church, stands in stark contrast to its drab surroundings in the former closed military district of Karosta. The cathedral served the Russian imperial navy crewmen who were stationed here at the Karosta port. Following the traditional design of 17th century Russian churches, Tsar Nicholas II himself was present for both the laying of the cornerstone, and also the final consecration ceremony two years later in 1903. The cathedral was decorated inside with an extraordinary array of mosaics, icons, wood carvings, paintings, and frescoes created by a team of mostly Russian artists including V. Frolov, P. Abosimov, F. Railyan and M. Vasilyev. Unfortunately, when the Germans invaded Latvia during World War I, the cathedral lost many of its original fittings. What couldn’t be sent back to Russia in time was stolen by the invading army. Following the war, Latvia regained its independence and the Saint Nicholas Naval Cathedral was re-consecrated as Latvian Lutheran, to be used by the newly posted sailors of the Latvian navy. When Latvia came under Soviet occupation, from 1944 onward, this port district became a “closed town.” High fences were built around Karosta, its port now serving as a maximum-security naval base for the Soviet Baltic Fleet. Not even locals from the city of Liepāja were able to enter the district, while those posted inside Karosta were likewise unable to leave. Under Soviet rule, the Karosta base was developed with new residential units that took the form of largely concrete housing blocks, for crewmen and their families, as well as various new cultural venues for the entertainment of the base’s residents. The St Nicholas Naval Cathedral, its religious functions redundant under the Soviets’ imposed state atheism, was adapted for use as a cinema and sports hall. The spacious dome above the main interior space was even closed off, as the acoustics made it difficult to follow the dialogue of movies being screened inside the former cathedral. The cathedral retained this mundane status right through until the fall of the Soviet Union. When Latvia regained independence in 1991, however, the building was restored and became a working cathedral of the Latvian Orthodox Church. The Soviet-era blocks of Karosta slipped into gradual decline after the Russian navy left the region in 1994, and today, the district can sometimes feel like a rather sad satellite of Liepāja, showing signs of both economic and physical decline. These surroundings make the Saint Nicholas Naval Cathedral all the more striking, its glittering golden domes rising in defiance above the blocks of its former persecutors.  The Saint Nicholas Naval Cathedral is free to visit, and open from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. every day of the week.",cathedral soviet history military history churches military sacred spaces
27,Virtaka Cliff,"Krimulda Parish, Latvia",This remote sandstone cliff has one of the richest collections of Livonian petroglyph marks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/virtaka-cliff,"Humans have a tendency to carve their names or initials to sandstone cliffs and cave walls, but unless this type of graffiti dates back to hundreds of years these, the markings are not considered to be something valuable and are actively discouraged. This makes discovering some cliffs filled with not graffiti, but mysterious centuries-old symbols, come as quite a surprise. The Virtaka Cliff carvings were discovered in 1986 by local cave researcher Guntis Eniņš. It’s hard to get an exact estimate of how old these pagan symbols and marks are because historical records of them are lacking. The cliffs are covered with different circles, crosses, zigzag signs, stylized human figures, and other marks. The symbols’ meanings are yet to be determined. The most common theory is that they’re old ownership or property marks. However, it is not clearly explained why such property marks were all scrawled into this remote and difficult to reach cliff. Another opinion is that the symbols were left on the cliff during a funeral ritual as a commemorative token about a person or as a protective sign for the soul. Yet another interpretation is that these symbols have a ritual or sacrificial meaning, marks left by old sorcerers or healers that still followed pagan beliefs after these areas were Christianized. It is also proposed that these marks constitute an ideographic script and the Virtaka Cliff tells a story about the mythical world view of the local people, the Livonians, who had a difficult and tragic history. Livonians once populated quite a large area in southern Estonia and northern Latvia. During the Christian crusades to Northern Europe, the Livonian king, Caupo of Turaida, willingly converted to Christianity. The Livonians fought with the still-pagan Latvians and Estonians, and during the Livonian Crusade, most of the population was killed. Now, there are fewer than 300 people of Livonian ancestry, and their language is considered extinct.  You need your own transport to visit this place. It is not possible to drive directly to the site. Be prepared for a challenging hike along the Brasla river. The place itself is correctly signposted once you reach it. Part of the cliff has been vandalized, so please be respectful to the history of this place! Anybody who is interested to see these petroglyphs but is unwilling to take a trip to the Brasla River can view a copy of the cliff in the National Library of Latvia. The symbols are all magnified by four times and represented on a wall of the Virtaka lecture room. It's located on the ground floor, and you can ask the staff to let you see it.",petroglyphs cliffs mystery art

Remains of such lake villages or fortresses have been found from couple of other lakes in Northern-Latvia and Southern-Estonia. However the remains of the Āraiši village appear to be the best preserved, and thus, as exact a replica as researchers could come up with was built on the spot using new materials. The remains of buildings from the original village that were uncovered during the 1960s and 1970s, and were studied in minute detail to discern just how the ancient constructions might have looked. The project to reconstruct the village-fortress was then initiated in 1993. To reconstruct the village, the water level of the lake was dropped about five feet, and large trunks and timbers were brought to the site to create the rustic looking dwellings. Despite having found the remains of 151 wood buildings at the site, only 14 were recreated on the Āraiši Lake Fortress site, which was then connected to the mainland by a thin bridge. The fortress is located on the larger Āraiši Museum Park which also features the nearby remains of a stone castle, and some recreated stone dwellings as well. The park is the perfect destination for time travelers on a budget who can simply stroll into the wooden island fortress and be transported back to the 9th Century.",villages fortresses archaeology
29,Salaspils Memorial Ensemble,"Salaspils, Latvia","This former Nazi labor camp is now a poignant memorial, complete with giant Soviet-style monuments.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salaspils-memorial-ensemble,"When admiring the beauty of the Salaspils Memorial and the heavy forests that surround it, it’s stirring to realize that what is now an incredibly peaceful piece of nature is burdened with such a violent past. Established in 1941, Salaspils served as an “extended police prison,” which later included a “labor correctional camp.” Latvian Security Police originally intended for the grounds to be used for a concentration camp, but the leadership of the Reich Security Main Office in Berlin did not give permission. But that distinction didn’t keep the camp from its own share of experiments, exploitation, and death. Though Salaspils was not a death camp—there were no gas chambers or gassing trucks—between 2,000 and 3,000 prisoners died there. Conditions for the survivors were grim and laborious. And the prison didn’t only house adult detainees—it’s estimated that roughly 2,000 children passed through the camp as well. The children were held in special barracks, separated from their parents, and given badges with their names. While they weren’t forced into the same labor as the adults, they suffered through their own miseries of malnourishment, outbreaks of disease, and medical experiments. Some reports show that only 200 or so children died in the camp, as many were sent to foster families throughout the region. But around the time the construction of this memorial began, a grave containing the remains of more than 600 children was found near the grounds. Today, Salaspils is a peaceful, beautiful requiem. Wrapped within walls of forests, the entire clearing is solitary and quiet but for the installation of the haunting metronome exhibit that plays a faint heartbeat heard throughout the grounds. The small indoor section of the memorial doesn’t overwhelm with informational placards and exhibits. Instead, the memorial aims to create a feeling of remembrance. The gigantic Soviet-style monuments convey the life at the camp. “The Unbreakable” monument captures the spirit of the prisoners while “The Mother” stands tall to protect her children in the face of “The Solidarity” of those in power. Perhaps most moving, is “The Humiliated,” cowering meekly behind a tree, hiding from terrors we are left to imagine.  From Riga, take the train to Dārziņi Station (not Salaspils station). From there, cross the tracks and follow the dirt trail leading into the woods. At its first split, go up the hill and soon after, a paved road can be followed to the memorial. But it is worth keeping an eye on your GPS just in case as there are shortcuts through the woods along the way. While the memorial has opening hours, they only apply to the small indoor section. So getting sun rise/set photos of the monuments outside of those hours is possible. Also note, there are no shops, employees, or bathrooms.

30,Big Christopher,"Riga, Latvia",The statue of a legendary giant who carried Christ and shouldered the world's sins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/big-christopher,"The legend of Lielais Kristaps (Big Christopher in English) is intrinsically bound to the history of the Latvian capital city of Riga. In the third century, a kind-hearted giant originally named Offero resided in a cave on the banks of the Daugara River and would carry travelers across its raging waters. One day, a small child approached him and asked for help crossing the river. The giant of course obliged, but the boy became so heavy that Offero, despite his immense size and strength, struggled to reach the opposite bank. Having eventually completed the crossing, the child introduced himself as Christ and explained that the great weight Offero had carried was the sins of the world. He then baptized the giant and named him Christopher, or “Christ-Bearer.” Upon returning to his cave, the giant discovered a hoard of gold, which he used to found the city of Riga. The original eight-foot statue of Christopher, which was carved from wood sometime around 1590, now resides in the Museum of Riga for protection. Locals still lay wreathes of flowers at the base of a replica enclosed within a glass box before journeys to earn Offero’s protection. Today’s statue dates to 1997 and was carved by artist Girts Upitis.",giant cities christianity legends religion sacred spaces statues history

Opened in 1991 by sculptor Ojars Arvids Feldbergs, the Pedvale Open Air Art Museum holds in its permanent collection, over 150 works of sculpture from artists in the surrounding area. The museum also welcomes and incorporates works by foreign artists, but the main edict of the exhibition is that the artworks incorporate or fit in with their natural surroundings. To this end, a number of the works take on a more organic form, be it with the use of natural rock or through the shape of their piece. In addition to the bucolic fields and imaginative works of art, the museum grounds are said to have their very own ghost. Called the White Princess, the specter is said to come out to see some of the artworks from time to time. her signature move is to make people feel like they should stay at the park longer, which is a pretty PR savvy thing for a ghost to do. The Pedvale Park is more popular among art hounds than ghost hunters, but that doesn’t make the sculptural flights of fancy found on the grounds any less haunting.

32,Kurmrags Lighthouse,"Liepupes pagasts, Latvia",This abandoned beacon is moving closer and closer to the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kurmrags-lighthouse,"This diminutive lighthouse on the northern coast of Latvia was built in 1923 at the behest of local fisherman. It is still standing today, although not in its initial location. Originally, the lighthouse stood in a meadow by the coastline’s steep sandstone cliff. However two especially strong storms to hit the area proved fatal to the life of this little light. A brutal storm in 1967 caused the light to go dark. Then another storm hit in 2005, washing the weathered beacon onto the beach at the edge of the sea. Erosion from the ocean has moved the lonely lighthouse closer and closer to the sea, and now the waves already reach the foot of the beacon. This movement has probably caused its signature tilt as well, from which it gets the nickname “the leaning tower of Latvia.”  It is best to visit with your own transport. Note that parking options around the lighthouse area are extremely limited due to private property signs and very narrow dirt roads. It's better is to park the car somewhere in a public parking area and take a walk by the seashore.",storms weather lighthouses beaches abandoned

It was erected in 1935, on the site where a statue of Russian ruler Peter the Great once stood. The monument was built using funds donated by the residents of Riga. It stands as a memorial to honor soldiers killed during the Latvian War of Independence (1918 – 1920). Standing 43 meters (141 feet) high, the monument’s granite base is topped with a copper figure of Liberty lifting three gilded stars. There are four levels, with 56 sculptures depicting Latvian history and culture. An inscription at the base of the monument reads, “For the Fatherland and Freedom.” Following the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition. However, the Soviet authorities were concerned that destruction of the monument would cause tension amongst the Latvian people. Therefore, the Freedom Monument remained, but its symbolism was reinterpreted. The three stars were said to now stand for the newly created Baltic Soviet Republics (Estonian SSR, Latvian SSR and Lithuanian SSR) held aloft by Mother Russia. During the Soviet occupation, any gathering near the Freedom Monument was strictly forbidden. However, independence rallies centered around the monument towards the end of the 1980s and the dissolution of the Soviet Union on May 4, 1990, resulted in Latvia regaining independence.  A two-man honour guard from the National Armed Forces stand at the base of the monument. Normally the guards change every hour between 9am and 6pm, though they are not present during bad weather.

Eisenstein, who is best-known for his silent films Strike and Battleship Potemkin and his innovations with the montage format, was born in Latvia but lived in different places during his life. He studied to be an engineer but became intrigued by Kabuki theatre, and entered the world of performance and films. It is said that Eisenstein once claimed he could script a film out of even a telephone book. The creators of the museum ran with this, and designed a hall with walls covered from end to end by pages from phone books. A small corner includes a vintage phone installed next to a list of famous phone numbers from the world of cinema. If you want to let Akira Kurosawa or Ingmar Bergman know what you really thought of their films, pick up the phone and search out the number. Or if you’re more old-fashioned and would instead like to write a letter to the directors, there’s a set of mailboxes on the grounds of the museum where you can drop in your epistles. The grounds are also marked with a 19-foot-tall table and proportionately sized chairs, seemingly unrelated to filmmaking, but offering an excellent observation point.

The barrels are located within the national park on the western beach of Cape Kolka, providing an excellent view of the sunset, and of the “seam” created by the confluence of the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga. The barrels have no electricity and the only light inside comes from a few small candles, usually set out by the park authorities in advance.

The original construction was made of wood and unfortunately was burned down. It was replaced by the current red brick tower in 1911. The tower itself is 28 meters high, which is not tall enough for forming bullets during the fall. So a well 20 meters deep was made under the tower to make the fall longer.

Designed by the court architect of Imperial Russia, Bartolomeo Rastrelli of Winter Palace fame, its baroque exterior is graced by ornate windows and striking cast-iron medallions. With 669 rooms, 674 windows, 615 doors, and 25 chimneys, the palace served as the principal residence of the rich and powerful dukes of Courland. Situated on low lying land that is prone to seasonal flooding on the banks of the Lielupe, Jelgava Palace lacks a formal garden and is not considered Rastrelli’s best work. However, it’s reputed to be the largest baroque palace in the Baltic region. Constructed on the site of a medieval Livonian fortification, the property was acquired by the Duchy of Courland after the disbandment of the crusading order. Anna Ivanovna, of the ruling Romanov dynasty in Russia, lived in the old castle during her tenure as the Regent of Courland. This lasted until her accession to the Imperial Russian throne in 1730. It was Duke Ernst Johann von Biron who commissioned the new palace in Jelgava to be built in place of the old castle. It was completed in two stages, reflecting the rise and fall in his fortunes. In the late 18th-century, the duchy was annexed by the Russian Empire and the palace in Jelgava came into the possession of its tsars. Fleeing from the terror and bloodshed unleashed during the French Revolution, the future Louis XVIII, was given sanctuary at the palace at Jelgava. Here, he set up a court in exile, following as closely as possible the courtly rituals of Versailles. It was in this palace that Marie Therese, the only surviving offspring of the hapless Louis XVI and his consort Marie Antoinette, celebrated her nuptials. Following the Declaration of Independence of Latvia in 1918, Jelgava Palace was repurposed to serve as an agricultural university, a role it still fills today.  As restoration continues on the interior of the palace, it's advisable to contact the following for current tourist information. Phone: +371 630 05617. Email: muzejs@llu.lv. Though most of the building is off-limits to visitors, the crypt where generations of Curonian dukes and their family members lie buried is open for the public.

Initially, the remains of dukes and their family members were placed in a vault under the chapel. The sarcophagi were later moved to the basement rooms under the new Jelgava Palace. The vault contains 21 metal sarcophagi and nine wooden coffins, all adorned and decorated with fine engravings and ornamental details. The oldest pewter sarcophagus belongs to Sigismund Albert, the son of Duke Gotthard. Sarcophagi from earlier periods (the end of the 16th-century and the beginning of the 17th-century) are simpler with only a few ornaments and coats of arms. The most sumptuous pewter sarcophagi belong to Duchess Elisabeth Magdalene, her husband Duke Friedrich, and Duke Wilhelm. Another group of stylistically similar sarcophagi in Baroque style belong to Duke Jacob, his wife Louise Charlotte, and their son Karl Jacob. They are richly adorned with acanthus leaf motifs, reliefs, and coats of arms of Courland-Semigallia. The last member of the Dukes dynasty who was laid to rest here was Princess Charlotte Friederica. The vault has sustained severe damage over the course of history and has been looted several times. The sarcophagi have been restored and are a permanent exhibition of the Palace Museum.

43,Ungurmuiža Manor,"Ungurmuiža, Latvia","One of the best-preserved wooden manor houses in Latvia, decorated with painted interior walls.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ungurmuiza-manor,"Initially, this estate was owned by Baron von Ungern, hence the name Ungurmuiža. Later property rights were bought by Landrat Johann Baltazar von Kampenhausen who ordered to rearrange and built the mansion house that we know today. Works were finished in 1732 when the baron’s family moved in. Ungurmuiža manor is the only surviving baroque-style wooden house in Latvia. It blends nicely with the lush countryside and oak grove around the mansion house. The building was decorated with wall paintings by Latvian artist Georg Dietrich Hinsch. Inside of the building he created his own world of art, much of which has been restored and preserved today. The manor survived a number of twists and turns over history. Old records show that it was constantly edited and rebuilt when baron’s family settled in. In 1751 it was topped with an outside clock. The building was vandalized by Russian military units in 1917. Due to lack of funds the house was not restored or inhabited after that. The von Kampenhausen family owned the estate until 1939, when it was taken over by the state. A community school was established in the building that owned the house until 1989, which actually saved the house from total collapse. It was extensively renovated to make it fit to be occupied again. Some painted walls and original stoves were removed and part of the wall paintings were covered with plaster to make the building suitable for schoolwork. Some works to save the historical outlook of the mansion started already in 1977. A foundation was established in 1992 to ensure practical and methodologically proper work in restoring the complex of buildings at the estate and to make sure that the heritage site was utilized appropriately. Major restoration of the mansion began at the initiative of the National Heritage Board of Latvia, with financial support from the Swedish National Heritage Board. The building now works as a museum and occasionally hosts other public events. It gives a unique opportunity to experience the atmosphere of 18th-century life. Visitors are also welcome to take a walk beneath old oak trees and have a cup of tea in the manor’s tea house.  Best visited with your own transport.

The original statue, representing a life-sized Barclay de Tolly in uniform, was unveiled in 1913 to mark the 100-year anniversary of  Napoleon’s defeat during the Russian Campaign of 1812. The statue was melted for military use during World War I. A replica was installed on the original granite pedestal in 2001. Tolly was born into a noble Baltic German family, who traced their ancestry to the Clan Barclay of Scotland. During the 17th-century, Peter Barclay, a merchant from Towie, Aberdeenshire emigrated to the Baltic region. It’s believed that the Livonian branch of the Barclays were his descendants. Following in his father’s footsteps, young Mikhail joined the Imperial Russian Army, steadily rising through the ranks until he was promoted to Field Marshall and Minister of War. However, despite enjoying royal patronage, he had powerful enemies in St Petersburg. Looked upon as an “outsider” by some and criticized by others for his “scorched earth” policy during the War of 1812, he was relieved of his command. He was subsequently reinstated by Tsar Alexander I and led his army in victories against Napoleon, culminating in the capture of Paris. Tolly died of ill health in 1818. A statue was dedicated to his memory in 1837, at the entrance of the famed Kazan Cathedral, St Petersburg, Russia.

46,Skrunda-1,"Lidumnieki, Latvia",This abandoned secret city is a crumbling wonderland of Soviet ruins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skrunda-1,"Sitting on the outskirts of the small settlement that shares its name, Skrunda-1 was once a secret Soviet military installation. For years, it has been abandoned to scavengers and the ravages of time, leaving behind nothing but an eerie shell of Cold War-era brutalism. But there may be hope for this ghost town yet. Skrunda-1 was first built in 1963 as part of a series of Soviet secret cities constructed for various military uses during the Cold War. It was named after the rural settlement located just five miles away, and at its peak, the base was home to some 5,000 Soviet personnel. The main goal of the site and its two large radar installations was to look for missiles coming in from Western Europe. The installation was comprised of dozens of buildings including barracks, a school, administrative centers, and even factories. When the Soviets were asked to leave Latvia in 1994, a deal was made that allowed the remaining Soviets to operate the base for four more years, which they did, finally vacating in 1998 and leaving Skrunda-1 to rot. The Latvians tore down one of the radar towers in celebration of the Soviets leaving, but the rest of the base was left to be picked apart for scrap Today, the 60-something buildings that remain are ruined shells of their former selves although bits of the original propagandistic art still cling to some of the walls; pictures of Lenin and Cyrillic motivational slogans. But before Skrunda-1 crumbles to dust, the Latvian government has recently taken steps to preserve, and possibly refurbish, what is left of the base. This would allow them to use the site for a variety of things ranging from military training exercises (which may have already begun), and tourist uses. Update September 2018: The area is currently under military control and civilian access is forbidden.  The published coordinates will take you to the heart of the buildings. The area is owned by local government and visits are organized by them. As of 2018, it is closed to visitors.",soviet architecture soviet history military history military ruins

The place is long gone, but if you pass through the dense foliage, you will happen upon a strange, etched stone and the discarded pieces of a metal cross. The nearby village too, is nearly empty, and the silence under the trees in the woods becomes all the more haunting if you know the legend behind the rock. There are several versions of the story, but one goes like this. A child (“neither boy nor girl,” but somehow hermaphroditic) died, and was buried in the village cemetery. Whether the child was killed or died of natural causes goes unstated, but one is inclined to assume the former, as its spirit remained restless. Soon after the burial, the villagers were awakened in the night by a ceaseless screaming sound coming from the graveyard. A priest, called to put an end to the haunting, ordered that a stone with a carved cross be placed on the grave. Still, the screeching did not stop. It took 13 crosses, deeply clawed into the rock, for the howling to fade away. Ghost stories, however fantastical, do come from somewhere. Although the stone has not been officially dated, the story, when considered in the historical sense, may point to a moment of religious transition. Latvia and the other Baltic states were among the last regions in Europe to be Christianized, and local mythology and pockets of Finnic paganism survived in the Latvian countryside until as late as the 17th century. The haunting of Avabmuiza may very well be considered an early Christian triumph over an unearthly kind of magic.

The memorial complex dominates the park with its towering 249 foot (76 meters tall) obelisk. It is adorned with five golden stars that symbolize the five years of WWII. On either side of the obelisk are bronze statues of Mother Motherland and a band of three soldiers. The monument can be found in the city park created in 1909 when Latvia was part of the Russian Empire. The park’s opening ceremony was attended by Tsar Nicholas II. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Latvia declared independence. However, it wasn’t until after Latvia defeated the West Russian Volunteer Army in 1919 that Latvia was recognized as a new nation. In honor of this triumph, the park was renamed Victory Park in 1923. The Victory Memorial to Soviet Army has been controversial as it is seen as a symbol of the Soviet re-occupation of Latvia during WWII. In 1997, the monument was targeted by members of a Latvian ultra-nationalist group and was unsuccessfully bombed. There are ongoing discussions about removing the monument and re-designing Victory Park.    Take tram no.1 from Kr Barona to the second stop (Slokas iela) over the Akmens Bridge.

Known as the Hill of Witches, this public trail through the woods takes visitors on a trip through the most well-known legends and stories in Lithuanian folk history. Work began in 1979 on the sculpture park, and it now features 80 different wooden carvings from local artists. Painstakingly hand-crafted, each sculpture depicts a popular character from folk and pagan traditions in the Juodkrante. The public park got its name long before the sculptures were placed along the wooded trails, and is in fact a reference to the pagan celebrations that take place on the hill during the Midsummer’s Eve Festival. Each year on June 24, people across Lithuania dance, sing, and bring in the midsummer with the older folk traditions of the country. After Christianity came to Lithuania, the celebration was renamed Saint Jonas’ Festival, but many of the practices still have pagan roots, as is echoed by the fantastic world of the Hill of Witches sculptures.

The nearby city was founded in 1236 and occupied by Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire during the 14th century. Crosses are thought to have first appeared on the site during this time as a way of expressing the desire for Lithuanian independence. Crosses continued to be placed on the site throughout the medieval period by local Catholics. During a peasant uprising against Russian control of the area in 1831, the practice of placing crosses in remembrance of missing and dead rebels began. By 1895, it is recorded that there were 150 large crosses on the site, and this number grew to 400 by 1940. During Soviet occupation of the area that lasted from 1944 to 1991, the Hill of Crosses became a symbol of defiance. Three times during the Soviet occupation, the hill and its crosses were bulldozed. Despite these attempts to end the symbolism of the site, both locals and pilgrims once again begin erecting crosses. It’s estimated that there are more than 100,000 crosses on the hill as of 2007. Thousands visit the site each year, with the most famous visit occurring in 1993 when Pope John Paul II came to dedicate the site. A stone marker bearing his words, “Thank you, Lithuanians, for this hill of crosses which testifies to the nations of Europe and to the whole world the faith of the people of this land” now lies at the foot of the hill. A hermitage has been erected nearby to assist visitors and the faithful are welcome to add their contribution.  The hill is 7.5 miles north of the city of Šiauliai, in northern Lithuania.

54,Juodasis Vaiduoklis (The Black Ghost),"Klaipėda, Lithuania",A creepy statue of a hooded ghost hauls itself up from the water in a historic Lithuanian city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-black-ghost,"Klaipėda (formerly Memel) is a historic and relatively tranquil port city on Lithuania’s Baltic coast. Since it was first mentioned in historic records in 1252, it has variously been governed by the Teutonic Knights, the Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire, and the Soviet Red Army. Thanks to its historic role as one of the foremost ice-free ports in the Eastern Baltic, Klaipėda has long been an important maritime location, with large shipyards and fishing ports. In more recent years, cruise ships have been coming to Klaipėda, their passengers coming ashore to enjoy the nearby white sand beaches and the city’s numerous theaters, museums, historic sites, and traditional breweries. Arguably the most incongruous sight in the city’s old town, at least for newly arrived tourists, is located along the peaceful waterfront. Here, a hooded, wraithlike figure, not dissimilar to the Nazgûl from The Lord of the Rings, clambers up from the water, holding aloft a lantern in its gnarled hand. The bronze sculpture, known as “Juodasis Vaiduoklis” (“The Black Ghost”) has been terrifying children since 2010. Sculpted by Svajunas Jurkus and Sergejus Plotnikovas, the figure is 7.8 feet in height, with about half below the level of the waterfront walkway and half above. Apart from the ghost’s hands, the hooded robe is empty inside, creating a strangely expressive spectral appearance despite the lack of any facial features. For many new arrivals, the main question regarding this creepy sculpture is: Why? Well, it’s all tied to a local legend that isn’t quite as terrifying as you would imagine. The legend dates back to 1595, when Hans von Heidi, one of the guards at Klaipėda Castle, was doing his nightly rounds near the harbor. From out of nowhere, a hooded figure appeared near the water’s edge. Rather than attack the startled guard, it asked him how the city’s supplies of grain and timber were holding out. Von Heidi informed the ghost that the city had sufficient supplies, but the ghost warned him it would not be enough. At that point, the apparition vanished. Back in the good old days, of course, people were inclined to believe the words of ghosts, witches, goblins, and giants. And so Hans von Heidi dutifully informed his superiors of his ghostly encounter, and the city set about increasing its supplies of timber and grain. Then followed a bleak few years of hunger and shortage, which the people of Klaipėda only survived because of the ghost’s warning. So rather than being a twisted tribute to some nefarious Nazgûl-like wraith, the sculpture of the Black Ghost pays tribute to Klaipėda’s spectral savior: a Casper of sorts, just far more frightening.  The Black Ghost sculpture is located near the ruins of Klaipėda Castle along the castle marina, just past the swing bridge and near the Old Mill Hotel. Klaipėda is located in western Lithuania along the Baltic Sea coast. At night the sculpture is illuminated internally with a green glow, making it a little more creepy than normal.",ghosts legends statues

The barrier bar has been designated a national park by both Lithuania and Russia. As a protected area within a protected area, the Dead Dunes are one of the most dramatic and botanically significant features of this unique geological formation. Ranging up to 60 meters in height, the Dead Dunes still obscure four villages and two cemeteries that were swallowed by the shifting sands between 1675 and 1854, when the dunes were travelling 0.5 to 15 meters per year. Human activity on the Curonian Spit—also known as Neringa—dates back to at least the 9th century CE, and was subsequently occupied by the Teutonic Knights, whose presence led to increased grazing and logging. The resulting deforestation created a more transient landscape of sand dunes that warped and migrated with the prevailing westerly winds. Reforestation efforts began in the 19th century, and were largely successful. The Dead Dunes provide a glimpse of an unreconstructed stretch of Neringa. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the “Dead Dunes” moniker is a striking misnomer; the area comprises the Nagliai Nature Reserve, an ecologically sensitive region home to multiple rare and fragile plants. The unique flora overall provide a muted, earth-toned appearance, making the alternate name of the “Grey Dunes” make a bit more sense.

Tsarist Russia constructed the fort as a stronghold used to defend Russia’s border in the West, and the Soviet Union used the fort as a way station to the Gulag. However, the Soviets held the fort for only one year, until the Nazis invaded Lithuania in 1941, sending Soviet troops scattering back to the border. At the turn of the century, Kaunas had a flowering Jewish community. 1/3 of the 75,000 people in the town were Jews and the town was considered a cultural and learning capitol of the Jewish world. Prior to World War II, the Lithuanian Jewish population totaled 220,000, a very significant portion of the population. Unfortunately, the Nazi occupation of Fort IX brought tragedy to the community. A ghetto was set up in Kaunas, eventually holding 40,000 Jews. During the entire course of the war, only 500 Jews escaped, many joining the army to fight the Nazis in Southern Lithuania. Immediately after its occupation, the fort was used for mass killings of Lithuanian and German Jews. In 1941, the first mass killing of German Jews took place in the forest behind the fort. The atrocities continued through the war, and between 35,000-50,000 Jews were murdered at Fort IX in Kaunas. Many were placed in unmarked graves they were forced to dig themselves. 2,000 Jews also perished in the Kaunas ghetto when the Nazis destroyed it with explosives in 1944 as they were losing ground. In 1958, a small memorial was placed in the field behind Fort IX to memorialize the horrifying loss of Jewish life in Lithuania and Kaunas. Sadly, it took another 33 years before the current monument was erected. In 1991, the remaining Jewish community of Kaunas unveiled three massive steles designed by Alfonsas Ambraziūnas. The current Jewish population of the entire country of Lithuania stands at 3,200. Accessible from Kaunas city center",disaster areas monuments statues

Being both an artist, and a devout Christian, Vilius Orvidas felt constantly harassed by the Soviet system. Yet from his repression, he created a beautiful and innovative rebellion in the form of an open-air sculpture garden on his family’s land in Lithuania. On the outskirts of the small town of Salantai, his garden has become a sort-of folk legend to locals. Although Orvidas was a self-trained sculptor, the idea for his garden came from his father, Kazimieras who had saved and collected a vast number of religious sculptures that would have otherwise been destroyed by the Soviet government. With these beginnings, Orvidas added to the works, landscaping his family’s plot into a immense world of art on the fringe of being banned. Along with classic religious sculptures made out of wood and stone, Orvidas also included massive boulders, carved tree-trunks resembling Lithuanian folktale characters and replica Soviet tanks in his garden. While his work was not done in direct opposition to Soviet rule but more out of a curious sense of art and religion, many flocked to the gardens and considered him a great rebel against the oppressive regime. He died in 1992 at the age of 40, but his garden is still maintained by his relatives. The garden is open and available to the public for visiting and wandering the majestic grounds.

In fact, the museum, which opened in 2005, is dark and housed in the catacombs of St. Michael the Archangel Church. While the museum was originally intended for the blind, it has morphed into a place where the sighted can experience an hour in a blind person’s shoes. Its exhibits indulge the aural, olfactory, and tactile senses, providing the sighted with the experience of blindness. Sculptor Robertas Antinis spearheaded the project of converting the church’s catacombs into a museum. Students from the Kaunas Institute of Technology worked on the project as part their “Catacombs of the 21st Century” project. Signs in the museum feature Braille and Lithuanian alike. Visitors experience strange textures, soundscapes, aromas, and other sensory objects. Some of the textures, sounds, and smells act as navigational cues as visitors roam through the catacombs.",medical museums catacombs and crypts subterranean sites churches sacred spaces museums
60,The Church of St. Anne,"Vilnius, Lithuania",Legend has it that Napoleon Bonaparte fell in love with this Gothic church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-of-st-ann,"Standing tall above the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, St. Anne’s Church has watched history unfold around it. The 500-year-old church remains a prime example of Gothic architecture so beautiful, it’s said Napoleon Bonaparte fell in love with the cathedral. The Church of St. Anne was built for Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania, and wife to Vytautas the Great. The church was burned down in 1419 and then rebuilt in brick on the orders of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander I Jagiellon. Consecrated back in 1500, the facade seen today is largely unchanged since its reconstruction in the 1400s. It is unclear exactly who is the genius architect behind St. Anne, although theories point to Michael Enkinger—an architect of a church of the same name in Warsaw— or Benedikt Rejt. What is clear is that St. Anne is a stunning example of Gothic architecture, using dramatic archways, a symmetrical facade, and ornate pillars. According to legend, the church is so captivating that Napoleon Bonaparte—who spotted the church during the Franco-Russian War in 1812—wished to carry the church home with him to Paris “in the palm of his hand.”  Check the official website for visiting hours and information, prior to your travels.",

The railroad has been saving pedestrians from a 466-foot uphill trek since 1931. Today, it sends weary-legged tourists zipping along the hill between the Vytautas the Great War Museum and the Basilica of the Resurrection. When it was first built, the funicular only had one active car. The other was filled with heavy stones and served as a platform to balance its mobile counterpart. The bottom end of the railway didn’t even have a shelter until a year after it opened. Thankfully, interest in the funicular boomed and it was expanded and improved a few years later. The original cars were replaced with larger models and the bottom station finally received an actual shelter so passengers no longer had to wait while exposed to the elements. Now, the funicular serves as both a mode of transportation and an entertaining dose of nostalgia. Tourists enjoy boarding the brightly colored cars and zooming to their destinations just as locals have been doing for decades.",funicular railroads trains transportation

These are the rallying cries of the Republic of Užupis, population 7,000. It is a self-declared, largely unrecognized, independent republic within the boundaries of Lithuania. Declared a micro-nation by residents on April 1st, 1997, this community of artists and free spirits may or may not be playing an extended April Fool’s Joke. If so, they sure are committed. If it’s a joke, it’s an elaborate one. A president and cabinet of ministers have been elected. An anthem has been composed and a constitution authored. Currency has been created and circulated. A flag flies (four flags, actually, one for each season) and an army has been mobilized… with 11 troops in all. Their Independence Day, called “Užupis Day” of course, takes place on April 1st; be sure to take your passport as this is the only day you’ll get it stamped. While their military couldn’t exactly be considered formidable, the same can’t be said about their constitution. The 39 articles embodying Užupis can be found on a public wall, transcribed in 23 different languages. The articles swing from community-minded (2. Everyone has the right to hot water, heating in winter, and a tiled roof); to obvious (30. Everyone has the right to have brothers, sisters, and parents); to obscure (37.

Created by sculptor Romas Vilčiauskas, the little bronze mermaid has become an emblem of the Užupis neighborhood. It has been likened to Copenhagen’s Little Mermaid and is surrounded by the local superstition that those who fail to resist the mermaid’s charms will live out their days in Užupis. Užupis, which is largely located in Vilnius’ Old Town, is a beautiful enclave of history, street art, and historic homes. So, staying in Užupis would not be the worst of fates. The mermaid sits perched in a little brick enclave. Her tail poised ever so slightly to the side, her bare chest exposed to the sun, her snake-like hair seemingly splayed out in all directions like Medusa. It is the mermaid’s facial expression that is the most intriguing. With a look that is at once sad and longing, the mermaid of Užupis almost seems to be begging for company. In 2004, the beloved mermaid sculpture was lost to the rising waters of the Vilnia River. Thankfully, the statue was found and restored to its little perch from which travelers and locals alike can see her. The mermaid is said to be a symbol of love, temptation, intuition, hope, and power that attracts travelers from all over the world.  The mermaid sculpture is found on the bank of the Vilnia River, near the intersection of Maironio g. and Užupio g.",
64,Paulava Republic (Pavlov Republic),"Merkinė, Lithuania","Once known throughout Europe, this tiny and unusually progressive 18th century micro-nation within Lithuania now lies in ruins.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paulava-republic-pavlov-republic,"Few people are aware that in the 18th century, within tiny Lithuania existed an even smaller country. A mere 6.3 square miles, it was at the time the second smallest country in the world. But what it lacked in size it made up in its progressiveness. While surrounding countries lived in the ages of serfdom, peasants here had personal freedom. The country had its own money, army, president, peasant parliament and even constitution. The brave mini-state existed for 30 years, but now it is passing into silence. Today the mysterious ruins of old buildings are the among the only remnants of the story of the Pavlov (Paulava) Republic. The story began when Polish-Lithuanian noble Paweł Ksawery Brzostowski—a parson, philanthropist, writer and enlightener—purchased Merkinė manor. In the barren lands peasants lived in the grip of poverty. Abruptly and to the surprise of other noblemen in 1769, P. K. Brzostowski issued law in his new lands. The law announced the birth of a new Republic in which serfdom was abolished, and peasants were recognized as people with free will, with their own property, land and rights. Instead of serfdom, they paid taxes as land tenants. Meanwhile in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, peasants weren’t even recognized as citizens. In the Paulava Republic, people could freely engage in trading and crafts. President Brzostowski soon established schools for the peasants. Interestingly, the country had compulsory elementary schools and agriculture school with specializations. Brzostowski also ordered to let women study as well—quite a novelty in 18th century Europe. The country had government, police, and an army which if needed could defend the country’s independence with ʻʻgun and pommel.’’ It had medical healthcare, a financial aid system and currency. Every four years, the government summoned all citizens into assembly where a population census and conversations with the people took place. The micro-nation had a capital city, Pavlov, with a city hall, churches, an inn and dozens o houses. The ruins of the capital survived until today. The country also had four villages: Brzostow, Ksawerov, Zamojscė and Pavlov. At the time, rumors about the success of this upstart country spread across the Europe. The king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Stanisław August Poniatowski, officially accepted the existence of the new country in his kingdom. But the Paulava Republic’s luck ran out when it became evident that the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth would fall and the country would be taken over by Russian empire. They restored the serfdom. During World War II, the former republic was a home for nuns. After the war the buildings were left to their own fate. In recent years, trees and bushes that masked the territory have been cut, footpaths made and a monument for the founder of Pavlov Republic, P. K. Brzostowski, was built. It’s possible to explore the ruins of this former country that was once a hundred years ahead of its time.  It is only 35 km away from Vilnius. Be aware, that the place is near the village Merkinė and must not be confused with Merkinė city in Alytus county. So it is best to get where by using GPS coordinates.",micro-nations politics ruins
65,Pan House,"Žagarė, Lithuania",What almost started out as a spite house became an eccentric's found object masterpiece.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pan-house,"An unconventional man, Edmundas Vaiciulis always preferred to do things his way. Educated to be a mechanical engineer, Vaiciulis’ refusal to conform to the dress code at work led to his career in the field lasting about one week. This only strengthened his dedication to individualism, and his voice was a loud one when it came to politics and community business in his Lithuanian town of Zagaré. His engineering skills and colorful personality naturally led him towards artwork, and he began to carve large wooden sculptures; busts and bears and old men, all out of former tree trunks. When privatization was introduced after the Soviet Union split in the early 1990s, Vaiciulis purchased half of a house, which he was set on rebuilding. Unfortunately, the neighbors who shared ownership had no interest in the lofty endeavor, and so Vaiciulis had to find a different way to make it his. His neighbors had to agree to rebuild the infrastructure, but designing the outside was something they had little jurisdiction on. Vaiciulis began to make his house as unique and unconventional as he was. Soon, the outside of the house was slowly but surely covered in found objects. Pots and pans made up the bulk of the unusual siding, but metal plates and a plethora of household objects, as well as machine parts and random metal pieces were thrown into the mix. The garden was filled with many of his wooden sculptures along with more found objects of interest, and the barn wall was adorned with several animal skulls. Called “The Pan House” Vaiciulis’ house is now the most photographed home in Zagaré, and welcomes individuals and groups to come and take a look.",spite house places to stay outsider architecture eccentric homes houses homes

It’s nestled in the depths of a fairytale-esque forest peppered with wild mushrooms, berries, and plenty of happy bees. Musteika is an ethnographic village, which, in Lithuania, is defined as rural settlement that maintains its region’s traditional culture and customs. One of the many traditions its residents preserve is its ancient beekeeping method. The villagers in Musteika raise bees that are native to the region in a more natural way than most modern beekeepers. They hollow out pine trees—which are in plentiful supply within the forest—so the bees can construct their hives as they would normally. The bees are also able to roam and take advantage of all the nearby heather and black alder groves. The tiny village even has its own beekeeping museum. It’s full of traditional beekeeping equipment and examples of the hollowed-out trees the bees call home. It’s run by beekeeper Romas Norkūkas, who has a lot of stories and fascinating beekeeping information to tell. For centuries, beekeeping has been a traditional part of Lithuanian culture. In fact, in Lithuanian mythology, the insects are referred to as “God’s holy bugs.”",honey bees villages insects museums
67,Dvina Missile Silo,Lithuania,Launch site for nuclear war against Western Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dvina-missile-silo,"During the Cold War, the Soviet Union could have hit the United Kingdom with nuclear warheads with only four minutes warning. There was little time for reaction or defense, placing the entire British island on the edge of destruction at any moment. In the midst of the placid lakes and thick forests of Žemaitija National Park, is Dvina Rocket Base. If an attack on Western Europe had taken place, missiles would have launched from this Russian compound underground in Western Lithuania, known during the days of the USSR as the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), one of 15 republics that made up the Soviet Union. It’s an absolutely must see object in Lithuania. In 1959, the Soviet Union began construction of the R-12 (Dvina) Theatre Ballistic Missile. Constructed as a medium-range warhead capable of delivering a massive nuclear bomb, the missile marked a sea change in the threat level of nuclear attack during the Cold War and was the first Soviet strategic missile using storable propellants and a completely autonomous inertial guidance system. The R-12 is best known as the missiles deployed during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the actual missiles sent to Cuba were moved from a base just a few miles from Dvina. Besides being a threat to the United States, the R-12 was the largest nuclear threat to Western Europe during the Cold War, and that threat came directly from Dvina Rocket Base. With a series of complicated tunnels and four missile silos, the base was built in secret during the early 1960s. The Soviet government went to great length to conceal the construction from the United States and Europe, only allowing transportation of materials at night. To keep the project in a small circle and avoid too much attention, soldiers took turns digging the complex in five-man teams. Construction on the 100-foot deep tunnels finally finished in 1962, and the massive compound stood in secret for almost 20 years. In 1978, United States reconnaissance teams finally discovered the compound, only to find that the missiles had been removed in 1974. Finding the compound abandoned, locals turned the once apocalyptic site into a museum and tours of the tunnels are now available.",silos retro-tech nuclear disaster areas subterranean sites

After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, various Soviet statues were taken down and dumped in different places. Local businessman requested the Lithuanian authorities to grant him the possession of the sculptures, so that he could build a privately-financed museum. This Soviet-theme park was created in the wetlands of the Dzūkija National Park. Many of its features are re-creations of Soviet Gulag prison camps: wooden paths, guard towers, and barbed-wire fences. Its establishment faced some fierce opposition, and its existence is still controversial. These statues stand as symbols of the cruelty and absurdity of the Soviet regime and show the manipulations performed with historical facts. Some ideas originally meant to be a part of the park were never allowed. However such a large concentration of monuments and sculptures of ideological content in a single out-door exposition is a rare phenomenon in the world. The park also contains playgrounds, a mini-zoo and cafes, all containing relics of the Soviet era.

70,Female Pedestrian Lights,"Vilnius, Lithuania",These traffic lights celebrate the 100 year anniversary of the women's suffrage movement in Lithuania.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vilnius-female-pedestrian-lights,"Travelers in Lithuania may now notice something unique about the pedestrian traffic lights. The country’s capital city of Vilnius has recently given some traffic signs a makeover to feature the female figure. In honor of the centenary of women’s voting rights in Lithuania, Vilnius has installed 14 female-empowering traffic lights as of November 2018. The female traffic lights appear along the main Konstitucijos Street, opposite some of the city’s largest businesses. Unlike pedestrian traffic lights that feature the male symbol, Vilnius’ signs serve as a reminder of how far women in Lithuania have advanced and have yet to go. Like many other European countries, Lithuanian women earn 14 percent less than their male colleagues and only 17 percent of local women hold executive positions. There remains an undeniable inequality between the genders, which Vilnius hopes to address head-on. “Modern society does not exist without fully empowered women, yet globally all of us are still halfway on this journey,” said Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius via Twitter. Lithuania was the first European country to grant women voting rights back in 1918, well before the United States. The use of female figures in pedestrian lights is rarely seen in countries, making this change small yet significant.

71,Palace of Concerts and Sports,"Vilnius, Lithuania",An abandoned masterpiece of Soviet Brutalist architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palace-of-concerts-and-sports,"Following the devastation wrought by World War II, the Soviet Union’s leaders issued a nation-wide directive to create new venues for entertainment and recreation. Countless new circuses and cinemas appeared throughout the USSR during the postwar decade, along with sporting facilities and the ubiquitous “Palaces of Culture.” These new cultural centers served both to distract Soviet soldiers and civilians from the horrors of the recent war, but acted also as places that might be used to instill a sense of shared pan-Soviet nationhood. In post-war Vilnius, now Lithuania but at that time the capital of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1944 through 1990), the area on the northern bank of the Neris River was chosen as a new center for sporting activity. Žalgiris Stadium was built using a force of German prisoners of war, and opened in 1948. It was followed by a swimming pool and a skating rink. The new developments caused controversy at the time. This had once been the location of Piramónt Cemetery, which, established in the late 15th century, was the oldest Jewish cemetery in Vilnius. Russian authorities had ordered the cemetery closed in 1831, and despite protests from the city’s Jewish population, the Soviets destroyed what was left in 1949 and 1950 as they laid the foundations for their new sporting facilities. While most of these post-war sporting venues have themselves since been demolished, eagle-eyed visitors can still read the district’s history from its road signs: including Sporto (“Sports”) Street; Olimpiečių (“Olympians”) Street; and Raitininkų (“Riders”) Street. A more visible memento, however, is the imposing bulk of the now-abandoned Palace of Concerts and Sports. Completed in 1971, the Vilnius Palace of Concerts and Sports (or “Sporto Rūmai,” “Sports Palace,” in Lithuanian) consisted of a large sports hall catering typically to sports such as volleyball and basketball, and with capacity for 4,400 spectators. In this post-Stalin era, Soviet architects were free from the artistic limitations of previous decades, and like many of its contemporary buildings, this sports hall was constructed in the Brutalist architectural style that had been popularized by Western nations. Years later, the Palace of Concerts and Sports would serve as a venue for anti-Soviet sentiment too. In October 1988, the palace hosted the inaugural congress of Sąjūdis, a reformation movement which played a large role in Lithuania’s efforts to achieve independence from the Soviet Union. In January 1991, this former Soviet showpiece provided the venue for a public funeral of 13 Lithuanians who were killed by Soviet soldiers during the nation’s struggle for self-determination. The Sports Palace remained in use after the collapse of the Soviet Union, though by the late 1990s, its arena had been converted to a complex of privately leased shopping and exhibition spaces. In 2004, it was closed for good after being deemed unsafe. By that time new, modern sports venues had begun to appear in Vilnius, and the cost of renovating the Soviet-era Palace of Concerts and Sports no longer seemed justified by its potential usefulness. Nevertheless, in July 2006 the building was added to a registry of architectural heritage sites, while the adjacent car park was converted into a memorial lawn, in respect of the Jewish cemetery that was destroyed to make room for it.  The Palace of Concerts and Sports is permanently closed, so don’t expect to be able to see inside—at least, no more than what you can glimpse through its large front windows. This unique work of Brutalist architecture is still well worth the visit however, and can be reached in an easy 15-minute walk from Vilnius’ Old Town area.",brutalism soviet architecture soviet history abandoned
72,The Extinct Town of Schirwindt,"Kudirkos Naumiestis, Lithuania",You would never guess that before World War II this lonely field was a bustling German city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-extinct-town-of-schirwindt-kudirkos-naumiestis-lithuania,"After the catastrophes of World War II, European cities that had been leveled by bombs began to rebuild. All but one: the German city of Schirwindt. Today you won’t find this town on any map; there won’t be any road signs leading to it. However, if you wander to the neighboring town of Kudirkos Naumiestis in Lithuania, most every inhabitant will point to a disused bridge over the Šešupė river, on the other side of which is a meadow of large bushes and trees. It’s hard to believe that less than century ago this meadow was a thriving city. Schirwindt was a border city in Prussia-Germany—the state border between Germany and Russia was at the bridge over the Šešupė. Its main business was border trade with Kudirkos Naumiestis. Germans went to Kudirkos Naumiestis to trade geese, horses, and cows for smoked meat. Lithuanians went to Schirwindt for western clothes and shoes. The two towns were also engaged in secret spirit smuggling, as the price of alcohol between the two nations differed wildly. Until the beginning of World War II about 1,500 people called Schirwindt home. The town had red brick houses and cobbled streets. Just on the outskirts of the city stood the tallest windmill in East Prussia. There were several churches and a railway station. So what happened to this city? Schirwindt’s end came in October of 1944. The first Russian Red Army missiles in Nazi Germany fell exactly on the town, as it was the furthest east Nazi outpost. (The missiles are currently displayed in one of the Saint Petersburg museums.) The city was completely destroyed, and the residents who survived the bombing fled. After the war, East Prussia was incorporated into Russia as Kaliningrad Oblast. The fields where Schirwindt once stood were cleared, renamed Kutuzovo, and used for army practices. Since then it has been abandoned and no one lives in the region. Today only a German soldiers’ cemetery and the old bridge that connected Schirwindt to Kudirkos Naumiestis remain. Kudirkos Naumiestis does its best to eulogize its lost sister city. “Schirwindt Path” leads from Kudirkos Naumiestis’s main church to the defunct bridge. In 2011 a museum dedicated to Schirwindt opened in Kudirkos Naumiestis, named “Schirwindter Stube” (“Schirwindt Room”). Grain by grain the curators collected everything that was left of the city. Here you can touch bricks from Immanuel church, read original letters sent to and from Schirwindt, and see everyday objects from the life of an extinct city. It is best to visit the museum first. The guides and owners of museum speak German, Russian and Lithuanian. Here you will also be shown there the lost city of Schirwindt stood. You must call in advance (+370 681 47265 or +370 345 57451).

So, to celebrate, they broke a world record with a pyramid made out of their disused coins. The project was the brainchild of two Lithuanian physics students, Vytautas Jakštas and Domas Jokubauskis, who wanted to create a fitting memorial to the currency they grew up with. To this end, the pair designed a pyramid created out of over a million one-cent pieces. The project began with much simpler goals, but as the collecting began, they found that they had many more coins on their hands than they had anticipated and the triangular monument was proposed. Whether the creators intended a symbolic connection between the death of their former coin (the lita) and the funereal purpose behind the iconic Egyptian pyramids is unknown. Built on a table in the Bank of Lithuania’s Money Museum, the heavy monument reaches over a meter tall and was stacked over three weeks prior to the new year. The pyramid marks the single largest coin pyramid in the world according to the creators.

74,Frank Zappa Memorial,"Vilnius, Lithuania",The Frank Zappa fan club erected this monument to their prog-rock hero to mark a new era of post-Soviet Lithuania.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/frank-zappa-memorial,"Frank Zappa never went to Lithuania and had absolutely no connection to the country. However, the youth of Lithuania had a connection to Zappa—he was the icon of their newfound freedoms. This is evidenced in the Frank Zappa memorial near Vilnius’ city center. Lithuanian photographer Saulius Paukstys briefly met Zappa after a 1992 concert in California. He, like a surprising number of young Eastern Europeans, connected with the experimental musician’s style. The way Zappa pushed boundaries in music and in life was inspiring to the culturally adrift youth of the newly “liberated” countries of the former Soviet Bloc. Statues of Marx and Lenin had been torn down, and their plinths stood empty. Zappa died of cancer in 1993. The small artist Republic of Uzupis wanted to commemorate their patron saint, but Paukstys, as president of the Frank Zappa fan club, saw it as an opportunity to assert truly democratic independence in the new era. If the government would allow them to erect a statue of the man who sang “The Illinois Enema Bandit,” it would truly be a sign of a new era. Though the fan club gathered signatures, approvals, and funds for the Zappa memorial, authorities were suspicious. Why should Vilnius have a statue of someone with no connection to the city, particularly someone with such antiestablishment messages? A member of the fan club pointed out that Zappa had vaguely Jewish features, and as the government was very big on promoting Jewish history at the time, that was reason enough. A bust of Frank Zappa was sculpted by 70-year-old Konstantinas Bogdanas, the same artist who made the statues of communist heroes that dotted the city so many years before. The bust, along with a psychedelic mural behind it, were unveiled in 1995. The Vilnius military band performed various Zappa singles at the ceremony, which ended with a fireworks display. Following the memorial, Zappa’s popularity has only increased in Lithuania. The fan club is still accepting members, and a Zappa Love Letter Club functioned as a bohemian dating service for a while. Especially when on foot, look for the mural, as the monument can be hard to spot initially.",rock and roll murals music memorials monuments statues
75,Hotel Pušynas,"Druskininkai, Lithuania",This striking structure is the Socialist-modernist centerpiece of a former Soviet spa resort.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-pusynas,"The town of Druskininkai, located in southern Lithuania not far from the borders with Belarus and Poland, was first mentioned in 1636. Its name derives from the Lithuanian word for “salt,” “druska,” owing to the rich mineral content of the local waters. By the 18th century, people were already traveling to Druskininkai to find cures for ailments such as asthma. In the early 19th century, the Lithuanian professor Ignacy Fonberger published his analysis of the healing water, which was shown to be rich in minerals such as potassium, calcium, iron, sodium, magnesium and iodine. In 1837, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia bestowed the title of “spa town” on Druskininkai. In 1862, the town was connected by rail, on the Warsaw-Saint Petersburg line. Before long, it was receiving not only convalescents, but had also become a desirable summer residence for the Polish, Lithuanian, and Russian middle classes. This spa culture flourished during the later Soviet period. The Soviet Union had a penchant for sanatoriums and health resorts. Lenin himself had been a strong advocate, and the 1922 Labor Code dictated that all Soviet workers should spend at least two weeks per year making use of the nation’s sanatoriums. Druskininkai, on the Nemunas River, was promoted as a prestigious health retreat for Soviet citizens traveling from Lithuania or Belarus. By the mid-20th century, its classical-styled tsarist-era health resorts were being complemented by the appearance of Soviet Modernist sanatoriums and spa hotels. At its peak popularity, Druskininkai received as many as 400,000 annual visitors, who traveled here from all corners of the Soviet Union. Hotel Pušynas was perhaps the most striking of Druskininkai’s Soviet-era spa hotels. This 66-room hotel was opened in 1982 under its original name Sūrutis Sanatorium. The building’s architects, R. Šilinskas and N. Kėvišas, intended for the cylindrical building to resemble a huge, concrete pine cone. Later, the hotel would change its name to “Pušynas,” meaning “Pine Forest.” When a newly-independent Lithuania began its movement towards de-Sovietization, many of the nation’s Soviet leftovers ended up being quarantined in Grūtas Park, a memorial garden just six miles from Druskininkai, which has become a repository for outdated political monuments. Druskininkai itself is changing too, with the appearance of new, contemporary health resorts, popular restaurant chains, and a growing population. As such, while Hotel Pušynas is far from being the only remaining Soviet-era retreat in Druskininkai, its extraordinary Socialist-modernist architecture nevertheless sets it apart as perhaps the most striking visual representation of Druskininkai’s 20th-century Soviet spa heyday.  Hotel Pušynas is a working spa hotel. It is located in the center of Druskininkai, close to the Neo-gothic Church of St. Mary’s Scapular. The town itself is a two-hour drive from Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, and could easily be combined with a visit to the nearby Grūtas Park.",soviet architecture resorts soviet history places to stay hotels
76,Stebuklas Miracle Tile,"Vilnius, Lithuania",While this monument tile is shrouded in mystery it also marks the end of the longest ever human chain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stebuklas-miracle-tile,"Local superstitions and history swirl around this unassuming tile named “Stebuklas” (“miracle” in Lithuanian), hidden in the vast Cathedral Square plaza. The stebuklas is most famous for its magical, wish-granting properties, but it also represents a momentous day in Lithuanian history. From August 23, 1939 until about 1991, Lithuania was considered a Republic under the Soviet Union, much to the protest of its people. Many saw the integration of Lithuania into the USSR as a farce, and called it an illegal takeover, a military occupation. Tense relations reigned between the Soviet government and Lithuania for 50 years, until the year 1989. The USSR at this point was on shaky ground politically: the Berlin Wall came down, the Soviet Satellites were restless, and Soviet citizens themselves became louder and more outspoken than ever in their unhappiness. The loudest and the clearest display of dissent, however, was perhaps the quietest and most peaceful. On August 23, 1989, approximately two million people joined hands across Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to make the Baltic Way, the longest unbroken human chain in history, spanning over 370 miles. The chain began in Tallinn, Estonia and trailed down through Riga, Latvia and finally ended in Vilnius, Lithuania, right at the stebuklas tile in Cathedral Square. The Baltic Way made a powerful statement to their Soviet government and also imparted a deeply emotional message of human rights and national sovereignty to the world at large, leading to the restoration of each country’s freedom by 1991. The stebuklas, therefore, is more than just a miracle tile: it is hallowed ground, a piece of inspirational history. If you do make it to the Cathedral Square in Vilnius, superstition would have you find the tile all on your own, without purposefully looking for it. That part may be more challenging, but once you do find the miracle tile, here’s what you do: spin around three times clockwise, jump up and clap once (not totally necessary, but certainly entertaining for those watching you), and make the biggest wish that comes from your heart. If it worked for the people in the Baltic Way of 1989, the stebuklas just might work its wonders for you too. Located in the heart of Vilnius' Old Town (Senamiestis), north of the Vilnius University, and just west of the Kalnų Parkas. Find the Cathedral Square with the restored Vilnius Cathedral and the bell tower, and you will then find the magical tile.",world's longest world's largest monuments

These seemingly common buildings were used to persecute and torture those who were regarded as a threat to the government. Now, some of these former KGB headquarters serve as museums to tell the stories of those who suffered during this era in history. You can learn about the sufferings of Lithuanian people in the Museum of Genocide Victims in Vilnius. It’s a somber, but important, reminder of the past. Technically, the big building can be divided into three parts. The lower section includes cellar compartments used to keep, torture, and execute detainees. More than 1,000 prisoners were executed in this building, and most of the bodies were buried nearby. The middle section of the building tells the stories of the resistance movement and deportations. It includes documents, photographs, and the personal belongings of people who were sent to prison camps in Siberia. The upper part is basically its own little museum inside the larger museum. Surprisingly, the KGB itself had a small museum here to display the letters of commendations and honors employees could receive for their work, which is now displayed as part of the Museum of Genocide Victims. There’s also a selection of various technical appliances that were used to spy on people.  The standard entry fee is 6€ per adult.

78,Christ's Resurrection Church,"Kaunas, Lithuania",This magnificent Art Deco church is a reflection of Lithuania’s turbulent history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-of-the-resurrection,"In 1920, the small garrison town of Kaunas unexpectedly became a capital city. Two years previously, Lithuania had taken advantage of the chaos following the Russian Revolution to declare its independence. The city of Vilnius had been the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, an enormous territory with roots reaching back to the Middle Ages, and so the new Republic of Lithuania declared its historic rights to the city—but it was also claimed by Poland, who pointed to the large number of Polish-speakers there. Vilnius (or Wilno to the Poles) changed hands a number of times in quick succession, but in 1920 a coup engineered by a Polish general put the city seemingly permanently beyond Lithuanian control. Forced to look for a back-up to host state institutions, the government chose the central Lithuanian city of Kaunas, formerly known for its compact medieval old town and vast complex of defensive forts. The only problem was that, as a local expert recently put it, the city “lacked almost everything that other European capitals had—infrastructure, accommodation, representational buildings and inhabitants.” Given an almost blank canvas and instructed to create a European capital, the architects of the time chose bold and inventive forms of Art Deco and modernism to express their ideas. The results were streamlined, symmetrical and smooth, often incorporating Lithuanian folk patterns and motifs in their facades. This was Kaunas‘s Golden Age, as the population boomed and the city spread out over and beyond the surrounding hills. Most spectacular of all is the Catholic Christ‘s Resurrection Church, a colossal, brilliantly white monolith made up of perfectly straight modernist lines that gazes over the city from Žaliakalnis Hill. The structure can hold more than 5,000 people. Begun in 1934, its Latvian architect Kārlis Reisons is said to have converted to Catholicism during the project. Kaunas was only ever referred to as “the temporary capital,” as the Lithuanian constitution continued to define Vilnius as the capital. And 19 years and 12,000 new buildings later, it lost even that status: in 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland and transferred Vilnius back to Lithuania, a prelude to occupying the country the following year. After the return of Vilnius, Kaunas never again regained the title of capital, but the city is now belatedly getting attention for its remarkable architecture – in 2015, it became the first conurbation in Eastern Europe to be awarded the title of UNESCO Design City, it was recently named the EU Capital of Culture for 2022, and a recent Guardian article listed Kaunas as one of the 10 best cities in Europe for Art Deco, describing the Christ‘s Resurrection Church as “as close to a skyscraper as a church can get.” As for the church itself, its story reflects Lithuania’s turbulent and unpredictable history in the decades since its construction. Left uncompleted upon the destruction of Lithuanian independence, it was used as a warehouse during the Nazi occupation of Lithuania, then as a radio factory under the Soviets, before work started on it again after Lithuania regained its independence–it was only finally consecrated in 2005, more than 70 years after construction first began.  The Christ’s Resurrection Church is on Žemaičių gatvė in the hilltop district of Žaliakalnis, itself largely developed during the interwar period, just outside the centre of Kaunas. It can be easily accessed by foot or public transport, but probably the most enjoyable way to reach it from the city center is by taking a short ride on the Žaliakalnis Funicular from V. Putinskio gatvė at the bottom of the hill. This is among the oldest functioning funiculars in the world, and one of two such systems in Kaunas, both constructed during its interwar boom. Kaunas’s Art Deco and Modernist heritage is scattered throughout the city, ranging from post offices to museums to residential buildings, and even a mosque (built to serve Kaunas’s Tatar community)—your best bet for tracking down particular examples is the map and guide produced by It’s Kaunastic, which can be viewed here.",art deco churches sacred spaces architecture

The pyramid marks the spot where in 1990, a young boy and his family are thought to have experienced a miracle, and today the pyramid and dome are believed to channel divine energy. The boy, named Povilas Zekas, was seven years old at the time of the miracle. While he was in church in the town of Merkine one day, he was told by a mysterious voice that he would have the gift of divine conversation from then on. The story goes that people who heard his claim were skeptical, but a miracle of light and divinity changed their minds. In 2002, Zekas, who became a biologist, built a pyramid with an aluminum frame a few feet away from the exact spot of the revelation, marked by a grassy knoll. The pyramid, protected by a glass dome added in 2009, is open for visitors to experience the extraordinary energy. The site has become a sort of New Age Mecca. Thousands of people from all faiths visit each year to meditate inside this structure. Visitors have reported that their spirits have been lifted or even having experienced a miracle of healing or personal success after their visits. The dome works as a huge echo chamber so if nothing else happens, you will experience overwhelming sound effects inside, since every sound or step is instantly amplified. You need your own transportation to visit the dome. It is open daily between 9 AM and 9 PM.",glass energy pyramids domes temples

The Lithuanian Ethnocosmology Museum, officially established in 1990, is the world’s first museum of its kind. It’s both a sky observatory and museum dedicated to highlighting humankind’s cultural relationship with the cosmos. The museum originated the word “ethnocosmology,” which explores society’s many visual, emotional, ethnic, cognitive, and spiritual connections to the celestial world. The multidisciplinary topic delves into past, current, and future links between people and the cosmos. The museum was founded to store, preserve, and disperse information about the newly invented discipline. Its creators were particularly fueled by a desire to explore Lithuania’s cultural connection with the stars, Sun, and Moon. The building itself incorporates celestial themes into its architecture and design. It takes the shape of the Cosmic World Tree, with an underground gallery as its roots and a spacious glass observatory at its top. Its insides are full of ethnocosmological information, which encompasses anything from texts, images, symbols, art, and technology relating to the heavens.

Near Trakai, the first castle was built sometime around the 13th century, and in the following decades, the town saw massive development and the construction of a second castle—known as Peninsula Castle. Lastly, a third one was constructed now known as the Island Castle. Located on a small island in Lake Galvė, just off the coast of Trakai, the Trakai Island Castle was built at the end of the 14th century, but besieged and damaged by the Teutonic Knights in 1377. After being repaired, the castle was greatly expanded, growing to occupy the entire island. During the course of the 15th century, the castle lost its strategic importance, being located firmly in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was turned firstly into a noble residence, with new frescoes and decorations, and then into a prison. Damaged during a 17th-century war, the castle was abandoned and was in ruins until the 20th century, when plans to repair the castle started to emerge. After extensive restoration work between the 1950s and 1960s, the castle returned to its 15th-century splendor. Now, tourists can enjoy its scenic location and visit the historical museum inside the castle.",castles history & culture architecture

First built around 920, the castle was originally an eight-meter-tall tower atop the tallest hill in the area, which was subsequently surrounded by farm buildings. It was not until later on in the 13th century that the tower was expanded upon, creating a more traditional castle-like structure. This final expansion of the site was carried out by the final couple of Counts of Esch, who gave the town (and its castle), their name. The village around the castle also grew steadily alongside its proud central tower. With advances in warfare, the town eventually built a wall around the entirety of Esch-sur-Sûre, adding a couple of smaller lookout towers that accented the more ancient one. However by the 1700s, the castle had fallen to the common folk of the village, many of whom moved into the ancient site. Villagers were still known to be living in the castle at least up until the late 1800’s. Today the castle continues to stand proudly above the town of Esch-sur-Sûre, even though it is in ruins. The site is now protected as a historic treasure and is illuminated in the evenings, giving the site a feeling of true fantasy magic.",fairytales towers castles ruins

In the heart of this region and pretty much exemplifying the aesthetic is a lovely wooded waterfall called the Schiessentümpel. Part of the Black Ernz river, the Schiessentümpel cascades over a large boulder, and in doing so splits the flow a trio of clear streams, before they collect once again at the bottom of the falls. The water is split due to three long grooves that have been eroded into the boulder over the ages, making it look almost like a giant hand is allowing the water to sieve through its fingers. Of course this happens at the bottom of a small ravine which has also been carved out of the rock by the ages of water flowing over its surface, leaving two sheer walls on either side of the waterfall. To make the scene even more of a J.R.R. Tolkien dream, a crudely designed rock and wood bridge has been installed over the ravine to bridge the gap. The crooked wood rails of the arch make it look like it was made by some elvish woodspeople. The waterfall and its fantastical bridge are a favorite location for locals and tourists who want to make their lives a little more unbelievable. The Schiessentümpel might be a symbol of Little Switzerland, but it could just as easily have been a favorite spot in a Little Middle-Earth, which we can only hope more cities will begin to try and identify.",jrr tolkien fantasy waterfalls natural wonders water nature
84,Bock Casemates,"Luxembourg, Luxembourg",An expansive complex of subterranean tunnels is all that remains of one of Europe's most formidable medieval fortresses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bock-casemates,"Once known as the Gibraltar of the North, the mighty fortifications of Luxembourg were first built in 963. Over the following centuries, the city was held in turn by Burgundians, Spaniards, Austrians, French, and Prussians, as each group vied for military control of Western Europe. Finally demolished in the late 19th century to prevent further conflict, the Bock Casemates are the only part of this formidable stronghold that remain largely intact. The Bock is the name for both the fortress erected by Count Siegfried in the 10th century, and the imposing rocky promontory on which it was built. Originally constructed as an impregnable position from which to protect Siegfried’s holdings, over time the Bock became strategically critical to dominating the west bank of the Rhine, projecting power across the French-German border, and controlling the Low Countries. As such, the defensive structures of the site were continually expanded and improved upon by each subsequent owner. The fortress’s casemates (i.e., fortified gun emplacements) were started by the Spanish in 1644, using the cellars of the medieval castle as their basis. Extended by the noted French fortification engineer Vauban in the 1680s and fully realized by the Austrians in the mid-18th century, the Bock Casemates were ultimately much more than cannon perches. Consisting of 23 kilometers (14 miles) of tunnels delving as deep at 40 meters (130 feet) below the fortress above, they included not only 25 artillery slots but also stables, storehouses, workshops, kitchens, bakeries, slaughterhouses, and barracks for 1200 soldiers. A well 47 meters (155 feet) deep supplied the installation with fresh water. The casemates helped the Bock resist a seven-month siege by the French Republican Army in 1794; when the Habsburg forces in the fortress eventually surrendered, the walls remained unbreached. Ultimately, the Bock proved too valuable, and its destruction (as well as the perpetual neutrality of Luxembourg) was ordered by the 1867 Treaty of London in an effort to defuse tensions between France and Germany. The demolition took 16 years to complete. However, the casemates could not be destroyed without also destroying part of the city, so 17 kilometers of the subterranean tunnels still remain. The Bock Casemates were opened to the public in 1933, and were used as a bomb shelter for 35,000 people during World War II. Visitors today can still descend from the heights of the Bock to explore the expansive honeycomb military engineering marvel below.",fortresses forts subterranean underground tunnels military history subterranean sites military
85,Beaufort Castles,"Beaufort, Luxembourg","This noble mash-up in eastern Luxembourg is part Medieval, part Renaissance, all castle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beaufort-castle,"First built in the 11th century as a small fortress on a rock, Beaufort Castle had the requisite moat and stone walls of Medieval European castles. But it didn’t stay small for long, and by the 12th century a “keep” had been added – a kind of fortified, giant family room that was inserted into some castle grounds in case things got dicey with invasions and all. You might call it a kind of knightly safe-room. Adding the keep was the first expansion of the Castle, but it kept expanding, and by the 14th century a daughter of the Beaufort family married a son of the powerful Orley family, and the Castle became property of the House of Orley. The newlyweds had to expand their humble abode a little more of course, and the Castle grew bit by bit over the next hundred years or so, when it changed hands again. The Beaufort-Orley folks had a little scandal (a “breach of trust” as it was called), and Beaufort Castle was repo’d by Maximillian of Austria (who just happened to be the Holy Roman Emperor at the time), and given to a nobleman named Johann Bayer von Boppard – a truly excellent name. Add another hundred years and another Lord, and by 1539 the Medieval Castle found itself in the hands of a Renaissance man: Bernard von Velbrück. He added some pretty fancy Renaissance flair, including a big new wing in the Château style, and windows with crosses as part of new walls that were plopped right on top of the old ones. The next owner didn’t fare so well as von Velbrück. As a supporter of the House of Orange and the Dutch revolt against Spanish rule, the Spanish thanked Gaspard de Heu by capturing him, accusing him of heresy and treason, and executing him in the local fish market. (It might be fair to say that he didn’t expect the Spanish Inquisition…) As we all know, it’s hard to keep a castle up, and over the next few hundred years it changed hands again, but fell into disrepair. It took a couple of hundred years after the last full-time residents abandoned the Castle, but eventually, by the early 20th century, a new owner found the wherewithal (and the money) to restore it to such an extent that by 1928 the grounds – including both the Medieval and Renaissance sides – were opened to the public.

But really it’s just mining scars. Located in a forested area of the Little Switzerland section of Luxembourg, the Hohllay Cave has been the site of mining since medieval times. Also known as The Hollow Cave or the Breechkaul Cave, the low-ceilinged cavern was created when the rock was used to create circular millstones. This mining lasted into the 19th century, leaving the entire cave marked in eerie, scalloped designs from the cutting. There are also pillars that were left as supports, giving the cave a somewhat cathedral feel. It also acts as a natural amphitheater and concerts are now held there as weather permits. The cave is also a popular hiking destination. There are plenty of caves with actual petroglyphs and ancient designs for archaeologists to pore over.

These holdovers from the region’s industrial past recall a time when Luxembourg was one of Europe’s principal sources of iron ore. At the time of its independence in 1867, the landlocked Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was one of the poorest nations in Europe. However, during the 20th century, a competitive steel industry is developed in the southwestern part of the country along the border of France—an area known as the “red lands.” Much of Luxembourg’s current prosperity was built on the exploitation of the region’s rich stores of iron ore. Despite its small size, Luxembourg was once the seventh-largest iron producer in the world. It was one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community, which laid the early foundations for the European Union. Around 1910, the forest surrounding the small town of Esh-sur-Alzette was cut down to build Belval’s ironworks. More than 3,000 men worked at the site, which was home to three massive blast furnaces. In 1993, a switch was made to electric furnaces, and in 1997, the country’s last active blast furnace was shut down for good. As the steel industry in Luxembourg declined, the economy diversified into production of construction materials, engineering, and chemical manufacturing. The furnaces of Belval were integrated into the main campus of the University of Luxembourg. Since 2014, the furnaces have been open to the public, who can follow the self-guided tour to learn more about their functioning and the history of the iron industry in the region. Moreover, it is possible to climb up to a 40-meter (131-foot) platform on the furnace “A”, to the level of the feedstock inlet, and discover an impressive panorama on the region.

Similar to a water elemental or fairy, the melusine is typically depicted as a mermaid, sometimes with a dragon’s tail from the waist down. In Luxembourg, legend has it that Count Siegfried, who founded the city of Luxembourg in 963, married one of the legendary creatures. After hearing the singing of a beautiful maiden, Siegfried was entranced. The maiden agreed to marry the Count as long as she was allowed to be left alone every Saturday. The morning after their wedding, a castle, known as Lucilinburhuc, magically appeared on Bock, an area in the northeastern corner of Luxembourg City’s historic district. Eventually, after the pair had seven children, curiosity got the better of Siegfried. He snuck in and took a peek at his wife while she bathed through the keyhole. Siegfried saw his wife combing her long hair in a tub of water, but when he looked down at her legs, he say they were replaced with a long serpent’s tail. In an instant, she was gone, disappearing into the depths of the Alzette river. Since then, it has been said that melusine returns every seven years in human form to seek redemption. Another version of the story says she holds a key, and that she can only leave the river if the key is taken from her. If you take a walk along the Alzette, you may find a magenta, polygonal statue of the mythic mermaid seated on the bank. Local artist Serge Ecker created the statue in 2015, utilizing 3D printing, to belatedly celebrate the country’s 1050th anniversary.

The tradition has survived to this day, though the music bands rarely get to march with hämmel these days. Instead, they are accompanied by a tune written by Michel Lentz, the poet mostly remembered for writing Luxembourg’s national anthem. In the capital of the Grand Duchy, a whimsical fountain pays tribute to this tradition, a sculpture made by local artist Wil Lofy in 1982 and aptly titled Hämmelsmarsch. It stands on the site of Roude Pëtz, a well built around 1740 to supply water to the Fortress of Luxembourg until it was demolished following the 1867 Treaty of London. The fountain consists of bronze statues of a marching band, sheep, and two children giggling under an umbrella. The facial expressions of the musicians are rather comical, giving the whole sculpture a fun, wholesome impression. But there’s one crude rumor that has been whispered among the locals since its installation. The accordionist, whose face is clearly modeled after that of the artist himself, seems to be subtly extending his middle finger. While the reason for this gesture is unknown, there are two popular theories. One is that Lofy had some enmity against the local government, and the other is that the owner of the shop directly facing the accordionist opposed the installation of the fountain, hence the artist’s furtive revenge.",folk music sheep wells folklore fountains music history

Based on the carving style, cistern shape, and the worn smoothness of the stone, the water trough appears to be a Belgian bluestone horse trough made between the 17th and 19th centuries. The stone has held up remarkably, but it has also softened from use over time. The trough is roughly 300 centimeters long and 50 centimeters wide, with 26 centimeters exposed above the ground. The water cistern depth measured 32 centimeters to the bottom, which included a large amount of sediment. There were nine centimeters of fresh water above the sediment, meaning the trough extends at least six centimeters below the ground level, due to the difference in depth of the cistern and the exposed trough. Each end of the trough gives ample flat space for setting and filling jugs or just taking a rest. When looking at the Old Watertrough of Stone with your back to the road, you can see the water entering the trough on the left, circulating through the cistern, then draining out on the right side. It creates a beautiful sound that washes away stress. The views while stilling on the trough were lovely. In summer, grass grows up around the trough, making it harder to find.  No dedicated parking is available near this site, so use caution when pulling over to park and walking along the country road where the Watertrough is situated.

Created in 1987, the Saltimbanques, or “acrobats,” sculptures were designed by local artist Bénédicte Weis, who won the first prize at a national competition with the design a year prior. The bronze statues depict a group of street performers in medieval attire, including a clown and a fire-breather, as well as a whole troupe of dancers and musicians. Traveling performers like these are believed to have been quite common in Luxembourg during the Middle Ages.

The live-action film based on the popular comic strip and animation character, a spinach-loving sailor, marked the film debut of Robin Williams in the title role. Over 20 wooden structures were built with the tree trunk logs imported from Holland and wooden shingles brought in from Canada, making the town quite the production. Eight tons of nails and 250 gallons of paint were used in constructing the set, and a 250-foot breakwater was built to protect the filming area from the high seas. The film itself was a box-office bomb. But rather than tearing the set down or leaving it abandoned, the islanders saw it for what it was: a pre-built theme park. They eventually took over the abandoned set, hired actors, and the Popeye Village was born.  Boat trips and some parts of the village are not open during off seasons or when the weather is bad.

95,Mnajdra,"Qrendi, Malta",Stone Age solar temple is aligned with the sun on each equinox and solstice.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mnajdra,"Mnajdra (“mna-ee-dra”) is a Neolithic temple complex on the southern coast of Malta, less than a kilometer from the famous Hagar Qim temple. Built around the fourth millennium BCE, Mnajdra is among the world’s most ancient religious sites. It is also the site of an astronomically aligned solar temple, positioned so that the sun’s light illuminates the structure in special ways on equinoxes and solstices. At sunrise on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, when the earth is tilted neither away nor towards the sun, brilliant rays of sunlight penetrate the door of Mnajdra’s lower temple and light up the building’s main axis. And on the summer and winter solstices, when the earth’s spin axis is tilted the farthest amount towards and away from the sun, respectively, the sun’s beams fall directly on the edges of megaliths to the right and left of the temple’s central passage. According to archaeologists, Mnajdra also served as the backdrop for ceremonial sacrifice. This notion is evidenced by the flint knives, restraining ropes, and animal remains found at the site. The presence of stone benches and tables also suggests the temple may have had a sort of medical function, serving as a center for healing and promoting fertility. Since 2009, the temples have been covered by a metal truss and fabric canopy to protect the soft stone from erosion and deterioration in the elements. These structures were built without disturbing the site, and do not obstruct sunlight during the astronomical alignment.

96,Maltese Catacomb Complexes,"Rabat, Malta","The remains of more than 1,000 people lie deep under the modern town of Rabat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maltese-catacomb-complexes,"From the 3rd to the 6th centuries, the Roman city of Melite developed a complex system of burial grounds on its outskirts under the modern town of Rabat, a village outside of Mdina, the medieval capital of Malta. Roman law prohibited burials within the city, which derives its name from the Arabic word for suburb. Known today as St. Paul’s and St. Agatha’s catacombs, the burial grounds form an important part of Malta’s early Christian history. The catacombs include tombs for more than 1,000 bodies in 2,200 square meters. The organizational and architectural complexity of the catacombs points to the ritual importance of burial grounds in early Christianity. The catacombs were planned in a centralized manner, providing private space for numerous family units, while leaving a lot of communal space for festivals and rituals. The entrance to the main complex of St. Paul’s leads to two large halls, adorned with pillars made to resemble Doric columns and painted plasters. The main hall is equipped with large circular tables and couches, carved out of rock. They were probably used during burial rituals and festivals of the dead. In some places the burial corridors were cut in three subterranean stories. The catacombs were abandoned sometime in the 7th century during the later stages of the Byzantine Empire. They were reopened during the re-Christianization of the Island after 220 years of Fatimid rule. The catacombs became a popular site for religious pilgrimages in the 12th century and a Christian shrine was recut in the 13th century. There are a number of smaller catacombs dating back to antiquity in Malta. One was rediscovered within a traffic roundabout close to the Malta International Airport in 2006. The Hal Resqun tomb was originally excavated in 1912. Soon after its discovery, the catacomb was covered up by a road surface, following the development of the Luqa Airfield.

97,St. John’s Co-Cathedral Skeleton Tombstones,"Valletta, Malta",The floor of this spectacular Baroque sanctuary is covered in memento mori.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-john-s-co-cathedral-skeleton-tombstones,"While exploring St. John’s Co-Cathedral, it’s easy to be dazzled by the gilded walls and ceilings adorned with historic frescoes and glittering gold leaf. But don’t let this ornate splendor steal all your attention. Be sure to turn your gaze downward, too, to admire its marble floor covered with images of skeletons. The story of these cadavers is inextricably linked with the history of the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. In 1530, the Knights were given permanent headquarters on Malta and the island of Gozo. In return, they had to send a single Maltese falcon to the King of Spain each year on All Saints’ Day as payment. The presence of the knights here was considered important for maritime defense, as the Mediterranean was then a region of continuous conflict. Barbary pirates in search of slaves raided towns and cities, and the Turkish Ottoman Empire continued its military expansion. Such a danger would soon become a gruesome reality, when in 1565, the Sultan of Turkey, Suleiman the Great, sent a force of 40,000 men to invade and conquer the island, which was then defended by only 700 knights and 8,000 soldiers. Heavily outnumbered, the besieged Knights lost approximately half of their men in battle and many more of the ordinary soldiers lost their lives too, though Malta did win the battle. The decadent cathedral that stands today was built between 1572 and 1577. The nearly 400 Knights who fell during the Great Siege of Malta were originally buried elsewhere, but were later reinterred within the spectacular structure. The skeleton-covered floor is comprised of their tombstones.  The Cathedral of St. John is in center of Valleta and is open Monday to Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The entrance fee costs €10 Euro.

98,Secret Passage in St. Gregory's,"Iż-Żejtun, Malta",A hidden tunnel of bones in one of Malta's oldest churches.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/secret-passage-in-st-gregorys,"In the 1960s, locals discovered a secret passageway in one of the oldest churches in Malta. Within, they found a wooden shoe sole, a small wooden cross, three coins, pieces of pottery, chainmail armour, and a large pile of human bones. St. Catherine’s Old Church sits on the outskirts of Żejtun. It’s dedicated to St. Catherine of the Wheel, but locals call it Saint Gregory’s for a traditional procession held yearly on the first Wednesday after Easter Sunday. Very little remains of the original medieval church, built before 1436. The church’s present edifice is a fusion of Gothic and Romanesque and dates back to the 16th century. Its dome is one of the oldest Maltese cupolas. Around the dome is a secret passage built in the walls of the southern transept. The passage is U-shaped and contains a large number of human bones. Local legend claims that the people were buried alive within these passages during the siege of 1614. Studies conducted between 1978 and 1980 concluded that the bones were probably exhumed and moved there from a cemetery, and that the deaths had all occurred around the same time. For about three centuries St. Gregory’s served as the parish church for all of southeast Malta. The church once doubled as a watchtower; the orientation of the southeast transept of the church is aligned with the bays of Marsaxlokk harbour, St. Thomas Bay, and Marsascala Bay. The church occupies the highest point that overlooks the harbours in the south, a once frequent landing spot for Barbary pirates. The secret tunnel was ideal for the lookouts who watched for pirates in the bays. Unwanted landings were communicated to French troops in the north via smoke signals from the roof of the church. The church is generally not opened. They only open it a handful of days a year, on special local holidays.",secrets pirates bones tunnels subterranean sites medieval churches sacred spaces

Inhabitants of the small and arid island nation Malta have been digging cisterns for water storage for eons, but in 1902, while laborers worked on one, they stumbled into one of the most remarkable and well preserved neolithic sanctuaries yet found. Buried only 10 meters beneath unpromising city streets lies an incredible network of elliptical chambers and winding corridors cut into the limestone. It is the only prehistoric burial site that is open to the public and is recognized by UNESCO. It is believed that its first chambers were cut into a small natural cave around 4000 BCE or earlier. Two even deeper levels are believed to have been finished centuries later, between 3000 and 2500 BCE. For context, the first megaliths at Stonehenge are thought to have been raised around 2500. The Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum is also unique in that certain chambers, notably the “Holy of Holies” have shed light on what the insides of prehistoric structures may have looked like. For instance the corbelled ceiling has been taken as a hint that the temples on Malta’s surface, now uncovered, could have once sported similar roofs. The Oracle Chamber has beautiful red-ochre spiral motifs, while others house bones and clay figurines, or simply water. Certain walls reveal that the complex was excavated by drilling the walls with antlers and then using stone (obsidian, flint, and chert) tools to break away the rock. No matter how it was made, the Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum makes for a fascinating underground kingdom that makes modern burial techniques look quaint. Advance reservations required.

100,The Old Prison,"Victoria, Malta","This prison on the Maltese island of Gozo is almost 500 years old, and they have the graffiti to prove it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-old-prison-victoria-malta,"The nation of Malta is an archipelago of 21 islands, the second largest being Gozo, home to the Citadel, an ancient fortified city within a city. Inside the walls you’ll find the Old Prison, where you can get a glimpse into some pretty grim prison-digs from centuries gone by. Covering the walls and floors is centuries of graffiti, etched-in proof that carving your initials and crude drawings go back long before “Kilroy was here.” Known simply as “The Old Prison,” it was an active jail beginning in the mid-16th century, originally run by the Crusades-era Knights of St. John. At the time it was used for knights who were a little rowdier than the others, and their 5x10-foot block cells gave them some time to cool their heels, and apparently let off a little artistic steam. Much of the graffiti relates to the knights and their symbols, including crosses, medallions known as the “Malta Cross,” and lots of plain old handprints, names, and dates. There are also some intricate carvings of ships, some with multiple planks on the hulls. One theory is that the planks were used as a kind of calendar system for the prisoners, as a tally of their time served. The Old prison was later controlled by the British after the Knights were kicked out of Malta, and it was in some use up until 1962 when it closed completely, eventually being meticulously restored for visitors to see. Notable prisoners included Jean Parisot de La Valette, the founder of Malta’s capital city of Valleta, who spent four months there in 1538. He was convicted of attacking a man, and he later went on to become the Grand Master of the Order of St. John. Not bad for an ex-convict. The Old Prison is in the fortified Citadel of the capital city of Victoria on the island of Gozo, the second largest of the many islands that make up the archipelago of Malta. The Prison is open every day from 9am to 5pm (last entry at 4:30) except holidays. Admission is €8 for adults, €5 for age 12-17 and seniors, €4 for age 6-11, and under age 6 are free.

They were built sometime during the fourth century AD and were rediscovered in 1891. The Ta’ Bistra catacombs are important because they could potentially reveal the burial rituals of some of Malta’s earliest Christian dwellers. They’re the largest set of catacombs that have been found outside Rabat, where the island’s more famous catacombs are located. The site is 300 feet long and consists of 57 tombs laid out in 16 chambers. It was excavated in 1933. Unfortunately, the farmhouse that was built on top of the catacombs had caused some damage to the ancient chambers. At one point, the tombs were occasionally used as an animal pen, while during World War II, the catacombs also served as an air raid shelter. The farmhouse has since been converted into a visitor center. The visitor center, and the catacombs, are wheelchair friendly.

102,Valletta Tunnels,"Valletta, Malta",A centuries-old forgotten underworld lies beneath Malta.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/valletta-tunnels,"Located between North Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, with the deepest port in the Mediterranean Sea, Malta’s capital, Valletta, has long been a strategic fortress. And while the city’s walls protected it from the outside, a network of tunnels underneath the city have also provided protection for centuries. Malta was part of the Kingdom of Sicily until 1530, when Holy Roman Emperor Charles V leased the archipelago to the Knights of the Hospital of St. John. Today, we know them as the Knights of Malta. At the time, the price per year for the country was a single falcon. The first recorded instance of the tunnels was during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. The Ottoman Empire, recognizing the Malta’s importance, attacked the island. As part of their defense, the Knights of Malta dug tunnels underneath the area that would later become the capital city’s place to store water and food. It was even said that during the siege, Ottoman troops and the Knights of Malta both dug tunnels in their battle for the fort, leading to subterranean clashes when one side would break through into the tunnels of the other. The tunnels underneath Valletta were not purely defensive. Archaeologists say that some are the remnants of a sewer system that was more advanced than many in Europe at the time. Though the Knights of Malta were dispelled from the island by Napoleon in 1798, Valletta’s tunnels continued to be integral to the geography of the city, and during World War II, they were the difference between life and death for many locals. As a British colony at the time, Malta was brutally bombed by the Axis Powers in an attempt to take the island and solidify their hold on the North African front. In the course of two years, Axis forces flew more than 3,000 bomb raids over the island, dropping thousands of explosives as they passed. The inhabitants of Valletta took shelter in the city’s secret tunnels. City residents even dug new tunnels in their homes or businesses where they hid with supplies from the constant air attacks. But Malta held, the key to Allied defense of the Mediterranean. After the war, Valletta’s tunnels became dormant, until 2009, when a series of tunnels beneath the city was discovered during an archaeological survey to build a new parking garage. Today, some of the tunnels are being restored for public access, but many more still lie quiet and undisturbed beneath the city. The map coordinates are for the Knights Hospitallers history museum, near which a tunnel entrance was discovered.",tunnels subterranean sites world war ii archaeology military history
103,Jesus Tree of Malta,"Mdina, Malta",The Jesus tree of Malta bears a striking resemblance to Christ on the cross.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jesus-tree-malta,"According to Maltese legend, a local tree was struck by lightning many years ago, and changed in appearance. Its contorted bark metamorphosed into an image of Jesus hanging from the cross. Although the Catholic Church officially recognizes miracles, it has declared that these types of apparitions are no longer worthy of “public revelation.” The issue of public vs. private revelation has been a contentious one for the Church, but was recently clarified by the current pope, Joseph Ratzinger. Ratzinger declared that public revelations (essentially big, flashy miracles), ended with the death of the last living Apostle in 100 A.D. Apparitions, even though officially recognized by the church, are now deemed to be “private revelations,” which means one doesn’t have to believe in them. Such revelations are binding on whoever has them, but not upon all Catholics. Of course, for non-believers the tree is neither public nor private revelation, but rather an example of the psychological phenomenon of pareidolia, the perception of meaningful significance in a meaningless, random stimulus. Regardless of religion, these sorts of images of Jesus, Mary, the name of Allah, or a Singaporean monkey god, continue to appear in the oddest of places, and to intrigue the faithful. The Jesus Tree of Malta is located right off the main road from Zebbug to the walled city of Mdina, the former home of the Knights Hospitalier.  Take the road from Zebbug to Mdina. After leaving Zebbug, at the base of Mdina, there's a round-about. Proceed up towards Mdina, and the tree is located approximately half way up on right-hand side.

The ruins were accidentally discovered by landscapers in 1881, and while little remains of the house itself, the beautiful floor mosaics have survived the centuries remarkably intact, one of the best examples of Hellenistic style mosaics found today. Archaeologists determined the Roman villa was built in the 1st century BC, inspired by ancient Greek architecture, and was lived in up until the 2nd century AD. The domus had a colonnaded peristyle featuring intricate Hellenistic style mosaics that are the highlight of the site today, some depicting mythological scenes and others simply decorative. The fine painting and architectural elements would place the mosaic art somewhere between the 1st and 2nd Pompeian styles. But unlike its counterpart in Pompeii and Sicily, the mosaics at Domvs Romana have survived largely intact. At the purpose-built, on-site museum, domestic artifacts and antiquities are on display giving a glimpse of daily life of a wealthy Roman family. There are also a number of well-preserved 1st century statues of the imperial Roman family. However, the site is not confined to the Roman people alone. In the 11th century, while Malta was part of the Fatimid Caliphate, a Muslim cemetery was established on the remains of the domus. At least 245 burials were discovered during the excavations, which also unearthed a number of limestone and marble tombstones with Naskh or Kufic inscriptions.

The ancient catacombs that lie beneath the church are often overshadowed by Malta’s more well-known St. Paul and St. Agada catacombs. But this little gem is worth a visit. Notably, the St. Cataldus catacombs hold one of the best examples of an agape table, a circular platform hewn out of the rock used for early Christian funerary rituals. After a body was interred, and once a year on the anniversary of the burial, relatives would gather in the catacomb for a celebratory meal to commemorate the dead. The catacombs are accessed by a steep staircase in the church. The stairway leads to a vault that opens into the Baldachin-style tombs, where an arch in the corner is decorated with pictures of doves. Dating from the late 2nd to the 3rd centuries, these small catacombs were originally a Punic burial shaft.

It holds a special place in the town, as it survived a bombing during World War II. On 9th April 1942, as 300 people sat in the church waiting for mass to begin, a bomb dropped by the German Luftwaffe pierced the dome, bumped into the wall, and rolled across the floor until it came to a stop. It failed to detonate, and so did two other bombs that had fallen outside. Bomb experts dismantled the explosive and disposed of it in the sea. The Maltese people viewed the escape as a miracle, and today a replica of the bomb can be seen in a sacristy at the back of the church. This lucky event spared the the parishioners as well as the neoclassical structure, whose dome, commonly called the Rotunda of Mosta, is inspired by Rome’s Pantheon and is one of the largest unsupported domes in the world. In the 1830s, Mosta’s residents raised the funds for the erection of a new church on the site of the existing one, which was carried out such that the newer structure came up around the old one which was later demolished. This ensured that there was always a church to pray at. Designed by Giorgio Grognet de Vassé, it is beautifully decorated in shades of blue, gold, and red. After 27 long years of construction, the church was  officially dedicated in 1871. The Rotunda of Mosta is situated in the centre of the town 7 miles from Valleta and 2.7 miles from Mdina.",miracles bombs domes world war ii religion churches military sacred spaces history architecture

Incredibly, on days when the sea is calm, these boats are able to leave the sheltered harbor through a small crack in the cliffs that separate the lagoon from the Mediterranean Sea. The local fishermen increase their profits by also transporting visitors through this natural arch to view the steep limestone cliffs that surround the inlet. The area is dotted with curious rock formations to explore, such as the Fungus Rock and the Azure Window ruins (the Azure Window has sadly recently collapsed). The Inland Sea is not very deep, and you can see many small fish swimming below the surface. It is also an ideal place to dive, because it is easy to swim through the cave out into the Mediterranean, where the depth of the water plunges to 164 feet (50 meters) near the cliffs.  The sheltered lagoon, also known as Qawra, is widely considered one of the best dive sites in Malta. It is located on the western coast of the island of Gozo, in an area called Dwejra bay.

The residential house, designed by Andrea Vassallo, is a fairly rare example of neo-Gothic architecture in Malta. The country typically favors more Baroque designs in its buildings. The unique neo-Gothic house is now well-received by the public and tourists, though some did criticize it for its different style when it was first revealed in the early 20th century. Its ornate facade, intricate rooftop, and notable arches are telltale signs of the building’s distinct Gothic Revival architectural roots. Andrea Vassallo was an eclectic Maltese architect. His work wasn’t just limited to neo-Gothic creations. He also designed buildings in the neo-Classic, Rococo Revival, Art Nouveau, and neo-Romanesque styles. The basilica of Ta’ Pinu on Gozo, the second largest island in the Maltese archipelago, is thought to be his masterpiece.

But there’s more to this restaurant than its menu. At the back, a stone staircase leads to a dark, underground maze where families hid from bombs during World War II. The tiny Mediterranean island of Malta, a crucial base for British air and sea forces, was one of the most bombed parts of Europe in the war. During a period of sustained bombardment, 6,700 tons of bombs were dropped over 154 days and nights. Many of the inhabitants, particularly those who did not work for the British military, were forced underground into air raid shelters. It is not known how many of these shelters exist across the islands of the Maltese archipelago. Many started out as wells or storage areas, and after the end of the war, many were closed off or returned to their prewar use. Some were constructed for communal use; others were owned by individual families. Still, groups of families came together and shared these spaces. Those who lived in the harbor areas, which were the most heavily bombarded, often fled inland to the houses and air raid shelters of distant family members or friends, and were called (since they were out-of-towners) refugees. The air raid shelter at Il-Barri was, like most others, dug out by hand. The walls are rough and still show the markings of the pickaxes that were used to create this underground refuge. There is a central corridor leading all the way down to the end, with small rooms on both sides, and, uniquely, an exit to ground level at each end. The individual rooms were used by the families that could afford them, while others had to find some space for themselves and their families in the corridors, having brought with them whatever they could grab once the warning sirens went off. Other rooms had a particular purpose (a schoolroom, a chapel). Each room hints at the lives lived, loves lost, childhoods missed, and prayers made in a time when hiding underground was necessary for survival.  The air raid shelter is open for visitors Tuesdays to Saturdays between 9am and 1pm, and Sundays and holidays between 10am and 11:30am.

But some of its most fascinating features can’t be seen by scanning the horizon. Just across the view of the land below, there’s a series of prehistoric tombs and cave dwellings. These troglodytic sites stretch across different levels. Some are fairly shallow, whereas others contain corridors that wind their way into even further caves and chambers. The origins of the site are shrouded in mystery. Archaeologists can’t reach a consensus on what time period they’re from. Some say the troglodytic site dates from the Bronze Age; others claim the caves are a Punico-Roman necropolis; and yet still others insist the caverns are actually the remains of catacombs from a first-century Greek cemetery. One thing that is certain, however, is that this enigmatic place was briefly used during the 20th century. Like many other underground settlements scattered throughout the country, the caves served as a hiding spot for the locals during the bombings of World War II.

111,Buġibba Temple,"San Pawl il-Baħar, Malta",The ruins of a megalithic monument sit right in the garden of a luxurious Maltese resort.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bugibba-temple,"At the Dolmen Resort Hotel in Saint Paul Bay on the island of Malta, you’ll find a resort with a megalithic temple situated in its garden, right by the swimming pool. It’s a magnificent mix of luxury relaxation and ancient archeology, and the only one of its kind. Buġibba Temple was discovered by the Maltese archaeologist Themistocles Zammit in the 1920s after he noticed the large stones in what was then a field. The temple was built with coralline limestone during the Tarxien era of Maltese prehistory, which ranged from approximately 3150 to 2500 BC. Unfortunately, agricultural activities later destroyed much of the structure. Today the old stack of stones set against a backdrop of the hotel’s colorful exterior makes for a unique, disjointed scene. The hotel was built around Buġibba Temple, likely to preserve the ancient remains. Today, guests can walk by and admire the portion of the temple’s façade that’s still standing while milling about the property. During the excavations, archaeologists also uncovered two decorated stone blocks. One served as an altar and the other featured carved images of fish on two of its sides. Both of them are displayed at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta. Dolmen Hotel is near the central bus station of Qawra in San Pawl il-Baħar.

112,Prison in Fort Saint Angelo,"Il-Birgu, Malta","This almost-forgotten underground dungeon housed several convicts over the years, including Caravaggio.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prison-in-fort-saint-angelo,"One of Malta’s most well-known landmarks, Fort Saint Angelo, was fortified in 1530, when the Order of Saint John came to the island. The original structure, which was crumbling, was rebuilt and became the residence of the head of the Catholic military order, as well as the organization’s headquarters. The massive fort has several rooms that reflect its crucial role in Maltese history, especially during the Great Siege, which took place a few decades after its construction. But beneath the fort itself lies a prison which was greatly feared and housed many high-ranking offenders within the order. It was rediscovered by the British in 1913. The guva, or oubliette, was chiseled out of stone underneath the fort and could only be accessed through a trapdoor in its ceiling. The oval-shaped prison is situated opposite the Chapel of Nativity. and was originally a water cistern. Soon, however, errant knights were locked up there to languish as punishment for various crimes. Shelves and niches were carved into the walls to hold candles or lamps. One of the most notable prisoners who served some time in the guva was the infamous artist Caravaggio, who was confined there in the early 17th century before he escaped the fort and the island. Scratched on the walls of this grim and often unnoticed oubliette are various designs and inscriptions, dating back to as early as 1532, almost immediately after the fort’s construction. A lot of the graffiti, which is written in different European languages including Latin, reflects the despair of those holed up in the underbelly of the vast fort. A later inscription by a knight who was accused of stealing silver from the church and melting it down, reads: “John James Sandilands // Imprisoned in this living grave // Where evil triumphs over good // To the satisfaction of my enemies // So much for friendship.” Sandilands was later executed for his crime. Another prominent inscription features the shield of a French knight, whose family escutcheon is a swan beneath a chevron, with a right and left star respectively and a rose. The names of Italian knights Leonardv, Brvnv, and Annibale Parucci are still seen, with the year 1573 carved underneath the inscriptions from the Bible. The guva was most likely a temporary prison, holding convicts for brief periods. Although the oubliette is not accessible, there is a monitor which shows the 360 degree interior, as well as photographs of the graffiti and its history. The fort is perched at the top of the peninsula. Ideally, you should reach the fort on foot, as the street leading to it is a two way street and often a car has to give way to the other.
Even though the oubliette cannot be accessed, there is a display room with photographs and a monitors which shows the interior.",fortresses forts prisons crime history

It is no coincidence that this house is so close to the old Inquisitor’s Palace. Dating from the 16th century, this used to be the house of the executioner and his family during the times of the Order of St John and the Inquisition. The executioner’s symbol, an eye sandwiched between two axes, can still be seen engraved on top of the windows. The axes are an obvious symbol of the profession, while the eye is possibly referencing God’s eye and the divine judgment passed from the Roman Execution.

Il-Maqluba, which means “the upside down” in Maltese, is a 165-foot-wide, 50-foot-deep sinkhole in Qrendi, a very quaint, quiet town located near the Mnajdra and Ħaġar Qim Temples. This fascinating geological feature, located on the south side of the village, was formed in 1343 from either an earthquake or a powerful storm. Legends soon sprung up about its creation, including that a good woman tried to warn the inhabitants of the hamlet that their bad ways must stop, lest God order the earth to swallow them up. The site is conserved under the Natura 2000 EU network, and is home to rare native species of fungi and plants, including the Maltese Salt Tree. While you’re there, take some time to see the town, too. Qrendi is a typical friendly, small Maltese village and is well worth some time exploring in addition to seeing the temples and other nearby sites.  Il-Maqluba is across the street from the Maqluba bus stop, toward St. Matthew's Chapel. The entrance is to the left of the church, by a white handrail and some faded placards.

These ruts (or ‘tracks’ as they are often known) are heavily weathered and some examples have been found under the sea, just off the coast, or ending abruptly at cliff edges, thus suggesting a prehistoric origin. They are totally unique and nothing like them can be found anywhere else. There are many theories on the original purpose of these man made structures. Perhaps it was an ancient irrigation system or a way of marking ceremonial routes, although the most likely explanation is that the tracks are the result of ‘sledgecarts’ being dragged over the same route for hundreds of years, creating the deep grooves that are seen today. Whatever their purpose, they are a fascinating, yet puzzling sight to behold. The best example being at ‘Clapham Junction’ on the south of the island. Thus named because the complex pattern of ruts was supposed to resemble the railway tracks at Clapham Junction railway station in London, England.",ruins

They used huge boulders to construct their homes that reached the sky. Eventually, these giants died off and their homes fell apart—abandoned and forgotten. This has long been the legend surrounding the existence of the Ġgantija megalithic temple complex. While no evidence of giants have been found, it’s believed that the complex was established during the Neolithic Period. The temple is the second oldest manmade religious structure in the world, just behind Göbekli Tepe in Turkey. It’s thought that the temple was originally the site of rituals involving animals and may have been utilized in fertility rites.

Abandoned after World War II, the chapel and the land that it sits on were eventually sold to a German entrepreneur. The buyer rarely visited the island and let the place sit empty for years. Over time, Satanists in the area decided to use the space for meetings and rituals. At the top of a solitary road that leads to Malta’s highest point, the chapel was out of the way and perfect for quiet gatherings. Aware that the owner didn’t live on the island, the Satanists desecrated the property, claiming it as their own. Symbols were carved into the floor and then filled with molten tar to create a permanent set of images. Overturned crucifixes were carved into the walls and painted in black over the altar. When the owner died, the land was sold to a Maltese contractor who worked to restore the building and convert it back into a chapel. During the restoration work, a 2,000-year-old crypt was discovered underneath the building. A researcher confirmed that the motifs carved around the crypt are Roman, which makes sense given that nearby towns are famous for their Roman catacombs.

Built in the 16th Century, the Palace has belonged to the De Piro family for over 200 years. The palace reflects the family’s long ownership; original 16th century architectural features are mixed with styles that range from Palladium to Art Nouveau to a cistern converted into a bomb shelter during the Second World War. The array of eras and styles reflects Malta’s long history under many flags and nations. Over the centuries the family has collected, along with original Maltese furniture and decorative arts, the Gothic, Florentine, and Empire styles. One room is decorated with what is traditionally believed to be panels from a ship belonging to Grand Master Lascaris from the early 17th century. Besides the many paintings of Popes, Cardinals, European nobility and family portraits, there can be found paintings by Pre-Raphaelite Giuseppe Cali, (the current marquis great-grandfather), and Art Deco artist Doris Zinkeisen as well as portraits of Sir Walter Scott and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The (guided only) tour covers a majority of the 50 rooms in the palace. Besides the trompe l’oeil paintings that adorn several walls, the Bohemian crystal, Venetian glass chandeliers and Carrara marble sculptures, there are the collections of the palace, which include silver, Christmas ornaments, religious artifacts, early medical instruments, and a collection of chess sets, (one by Lalique). The Archives and the Library are invaluable repositories of Maltese history, covering almost 300 years. New to the palace is the costume museum, with artifacts from the early 18th century. Tours can be booked online, but, when in Valletta, it is best to call ahead to see if the Marquis himself will be giving a tour.

The quiet Church of St. Paul’s Shipwreck is neither the largest nor the most ornate on the island, but its namesake harkens to one of the most dramatic tales in the early Christian church, commemorating the shipwreck of St. Paul. According to the story recorded in the Bible, Paul was being taken to Rome to be tried as a political rebel. However, the ship carrying him and some nearly 300 other people was caught in a violent storm. It ran aground near the north coast of Malta, and all aboard swam safely to land. The people of Malta welcomed the survivors, including Paul and his traveling companion and attending physician, Luke, warmly. Though the actual site of St. Paul’s shipwreck in Malta is unknown, St. Paul’s Island in St. Paul’s Bay marks the event with a statue dedicated, of course, to St. Paul.  The Church of St. Paul’s Shipwreck is one of the oldest Roman Catholic parish churches in Malta and is dedicated to St. Paul’s brief time on the island. Situated in the capital city of Valletta, the church traces its origins to the 1570s. It was designed by Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar and completed in 1582.

124,Transnistria,"Tiraspol, Moldova","A forgotten remnant of the Soviet Union, Transnistria is an unrecognized country hidden behind a heavily militarized border between Moldova and Ukraine.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/transnistria,"More correctly known as the ‘Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic’ (or ‘PMR’), Transnistria is one of a number of frozen conflict zones that emerged following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. (Others include the unrecognised states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia along the Russian-Georgian border, as well as Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway territory of Azerbaijan.) The name ‘Transnistria’ comes from ‘Trans Dniester’: a reference to the River Dniester, which forms the natural border between Moldova and its breakaway republic. This was the front line of a war waged between 1990 and 1992. Known as the ‘War of Transnistria,’ this bloody conflict arose when the region beyond the Dniester refused to join the newly formed Republic of Moldova - instead fighting for independence as the PMR. What was once a battlefield now forms a heavily fortified demilitarised zone between the two territories. Tourists can enter Transnistria either by train, or by driving across the border - although the latter approach means passing through various military checkpoints, complete with tanks and armed guards. While almost every other country in the world refuses to acknowledge the independence of Transnistria, this autonomous territory nevertheless features its own presidential government, a national flag, anthem and even a currency: the Transnistrian Ruble. Spreading from north to south, Transnistria covers a long, thin strip of land sandwiched between the River Dniester and the Ukrainian border. The population is approximately 470,000, with 140,000 of those living in the capital, Tiraspol. The Russian language is spoken almost exclusively in Transnistria. This unrecognised nation celebrates its Independence Day on September 2nd, a street party which is notorious for its all-out military displays, and often compared to similar displays in North Korea. One of the most notable things about Transnistria (and Tiraspol in particular) is the prevalence of Soviet symbology. While socialist monuments and busts of Lenin may still be commonplace in other former-USSR nations such as Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, Transnistria goes one step further, actually referring to itself as a ‘soviet state.’ Communist motifs appear everywhere from schools and universities, to the nation’s hammer-and-sickle flag. Meanwhile, Tiraspol’s parliament still meets in the city’s ‘Dom Sovetov,’ or, ‘House of the Soviets.’ Most tourism in Transnistria comes from the direction of Russia or Ukraine, with significantly fewer travelling from the West. Many of these visitors come to marvel at a non-nation often described as the “last outpost of the USSR,” although Transnistria also offers a range of more traditional attractions; including the Chitcani monastery, a well-preserved Ottoman fortress near the Moldovan border and the Bendery Military Museum: a fascinating collection of militaria located inside a disused Soviet train at Bendery.

About 260 feet below this little-known Moldovan town, over 75 miles of limestone caves are home to about 1.3 million bottles of wine. The fertile region surrounding the town of Cricova had no problem becoming a major source of wine for the USSR by the mid-1900s. They did have a problem storing all of it, however. Conveniently, the excavation of vast amounts of limestone to build the nearby capital of Chişinău left a sprawling underground network of cool, dry caves, ideal for aging and storing wine. As more limestone was mined to build the city, more space was created underground to host an imperial collection of bottled wine. After Milestii Mici, another underground Moldovan winery, Cricova is the second-largest wine cellar on the planet. Today, the above-ground winery is a jack of all trades, producing more than 150 styles, including basics such as muscat, pinot noir, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc, but also unique local varieties such as rkaţiteli and aligote. The “streets” and “avenues” that make up the underground booze-storage metropolis are named for the wines they store, helping tour guides navigate visitors through the network by mini-train. The winery is most famous for producing a sparkling variety known as kodrinskoie, utilizing methods made famous by French monk Dom Pierre Pérignon. According to Balkan Insight, a team of five women rotates as many as 35,000 bottles of the sparkling vino 45 degrees in wooden slots to encourage the movement of sediments. Though an over-the-top underground oddity, the site was made a visiting point for all official delegations to the USSR and, even after its collapse, still holds the collections of various political heavyweights. Angela Merkel, John Kerry, Joe Biden, and Petro Poroshenko all visited and were gifted private collection spaces. Vladimir Putin has an impressive assortment of wines here, and, according to Forbes, a gold-plated mini-car to take him through the tunnels. While no politician, the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, is rumored to have gotten lost in the caves for hours (guides like to joke that it was easier for him to get into space than out of the wine cellar). Perhaps most shockingly, the wine collection of Hermann Göring, one of Hitler’s henchmen, rests here, as well. After the Red Guard took Berlin, his collection of more than 2,000 bottles from regions occupied by Germany during World War II were brought here to continue aging. After each tour, visitors can sample an array of wines in one of the facility’s five extravagant tasting rooms, including “The Sea Bottom,” a nautical-themed room; the “Presidential Hall,” meant to host official delegates; and the unambiguous “Fireplace Room.” Feel free to purchase as much wine from the store as you’d like. Cricova’s not running out any time soon.  What makes the caves perfect for wine storage is a year-round temperature of about 54 degrees Fahrenheit. Dress accordingly.

The smallest public statue in all of Moldova, the Little Prince captures the whimsy and imagination of all who pass by it. In Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s timeless story, a fictional pilot crashes in the sands of the Sahara only to find himself confronted with an otherworldly fellow, the Little Prince. The seemingly simple plot weaves life-long truths into its pages, as the Little Prince encourages the pilot to look beneath the surface of what is seen and find the deeper meaning. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret,” the Little Prince confides in the pilot. “It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” It is these nuggets of truth that have helped this novel stand the test of time. In Moldova, the Little Prince statue is so tiny that it can easily be missed. The total overall height of the bronze monument is about four inches (11 centimeters), but the Prince himself is even smaller. The statue stands on a metal fence, by a lake in Valea Morilor Park, replacing one of the spheres that adorn the fenceposts. The idea is that all of the spheres of the fence represent the planets mentioned in the novel with the Little Prince standing atop his home planet of asteroid “B-612.”  Finding the statue can be a little bit tricky, but it's well worth it. At the main entrance of the Valea Morilor Park on Strada Grigore Alexandrescu, look for stairs leading to the embankment with a small metal fence.

128,'Welcome to Gagauzia' Sign,Moldova,This sign marks the entrance to a tiny proto-state within the small country of Moldova.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/welcome-to-gagauzia,"Driving across Moldova towards the city of Ciucur-Minger, you might pass a small sign reading “Gagauziya” and below that, “Komrat Dolayi.” It would be easy to miss the fact that you have just entered a separate country… the beginnings of one at least. There are currently 195 countries and 38 dependencies (areas such as Guam and the Falkland Islands) in the world. Considering the diversity of language, heritage, and history of nearly seven-and-a-half billion people, 233 states and dependencies is shockingly small number. Enter the autonomous region. Often disputed and rarely recognized by the country they wish to secede from, around the world autonomous regions fight to represent themselves as an independent entity, and more importantly, to control their destiny. Such is the case of Gagauzia, a proto-state consisting of just three towns, separated into four geographically disconnected enclaves all contained within the borders of Moldova; Gagauzia is an archipelago of national yearning. In the late 1980s and early 1990s as the USSR began to crumble and Moldova moved towards becoming an independent country, two groups of Moldovans began to wonder if perhaps it was time to declare their own independence. Nation building, it seems, can be contagious. In the more extreme of the two cases, Transnistria (also known as Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic’ or ‘PMR’) declared war on its parent country of Moldova in 1990, a conflict which lasted two years, resulted in over a thousand deaths, and ended in a 1992 ceasefire. The conflict has never been resolved and Transnistria has been locked in a state of suspended military aggression ever since. Gagauzia meanwhile took a softer approach. Gagauzia is made up almost entirely of ethnic Gagauz, a group of Turkish speaking Bulgurs of mysterious descent. Eastern Orthodox Christians, they speak mostly Russian or Gagauz and tend to share a rose tinted vision of rule under the USSR. However unlike Transnistria the existence of Gagauzia was announced not with guns but with a referendum. In 1991 Gagauzia voted unanimously to stay in the USSR, which quickly became a moot point. The next vote was for their own independence. By 1994, the Moldovan parliament had given Gagauzia a special legal status. Not a country exactly, but the right to some self-determination. Today Gagauzia is in a perilous situation. The poorest region of the poorest country in Europe, they lack many of the basic resources to advance their proto-state. In addition, while Moldova is actively trying to make its way into the European Union, Gagauzia leans heavily towards Russia, with statues of Lenin still proudly standing outside their state buildings.

129,Bendery Military Museum,"Bender, Moldova","A unique collection of Soviet military artifacts lies hidden away in a disused train, in the unrecognized Eastern European republic of Transnistria.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bendery-military-museum-transnistria,"The Military Museum at Bendery represents a rare collection of Soviet militaria, displayed within three consecutive carriages of a decommissioned Soviet steam train. The train is located next to the town’s main station, itself no longer in use - nowadays visitors are able to wander through the grand ticket hall, admiring the elaborate socialist-realist architecture of this now-defunct state facility. There is no entrance fee at the museum, which is curated by a team of middle-aged and elderly women. None of them speak English however, instead using Russian, the region’s language of choice. The fact that you can’t understand them won’t stop these babushkas from gleefully talking you through the exhibits regardless, and the team are very accommodating to photographers. Amongst the exhibits inside the museum are a range of signed and stamped documents from Moscow, many of them bearing the portraits of Lenin and Stalin; glass displays housing period uniforms, medals and military regalia; an impressive collection of rifles, bomb shells, helmets and other military equipment; as well as a primitive handle-driven computing device, bearing a Soviet star and the letters ‘CCCP.’ The museum covers the military history of Bendery, charting the town’s involvement in numerous successive engagements: from the earlier Ottoman occupation of the area, through World War I, World War II and the 1990 War of Transnistria. Speaking of the latter, it’s important to note that while the address displayed here places the museum in Moldova, it actually falls within the widely unrecognised Soviet Socialist Republic of Transnistria. Prompted by the imminent fall of the Soviet Union, this small region declared its independence from Moldova - and the bloody conflict waged from 1990-92 was later known as the War of Transnistria. At present, an uneasy ceasefire hangs between Moldova and its breakaway state. While Transnistria (and by association, the Bendery Military Museum) remains open for international tourism, you’ll still need to get past the heavily militarised border first.

130,Gypsy Hill,"Soroca, Moldova",Elaborate mansions built by Roma residents in Soroca to show their success after centuries of discrimination.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gypsy-hill,"Across the Nistru River from Ukraine sits the Moldovan town of Soroca, known as the country’s Gypsy Capital. In a country with few tourist attractions, Soroca is comparatively overflowing with them, boasting both a medieval fortress dating from the days of Ștefan cel Mare and several new “fortresses” built by members of the Roma community. The name “gypsy” is itself controversial, based on a now debunked theory that the Roma people hailed originally from Egypt. Recent evidence suggests that the group actually made their way to Europe from northern India. Because the word “gypsy” is so common, some activists advocate owning and reclaiming it; others feel the name carries too many negative connotations. (Regardless, English language speakers should definitely avoid using the word “gyp,” which is a clear racial slur.) While Roma communities have existed in Europe for a millennium or more, they have often been the target of discrimination and worse. Hundreds of thousands of Roma people were murdered during the holocaust. Today an estimated 10-12 million Roma live in Europe. The largest populations make their homes in former communist countries and nearly all are at the bottom of the economic and educational ladder. After so many centuries of struggle, it is perhaps unsurprising that those who achieve a measure of economic success want to flaunt it. So on a Sorocan hilltop, amid the broken sidewalks and barely paved roads that reflect Molodva’s status as the poorest country in Europe, Roma residents build elaborate houses, inspired by and borrowing architectural flourishes from famous buildings in wealthier countries including St Peter’s Basilica, the U.S. Capitol Building and the Bolshoi Theatre. Among the mansions is the home of true royalty, the “Gypsy King” Arthur Cherari. On Gypsy Hill (Dealul Ţiganilor in Romanian) some of the mansions are unfinished. Others lack creature comforts like indoor plumbing and electricity. Many are large enough to house dozens of people but may remain empty for long stretches of time while their owners earn money elsewhere. Regardless of what these mansions are or are not, a stroll through the neighborhood is an eye-popping experience, juxtaposing real eastern European poverty with knock-offs of wealthier worlds and ideas of what it means to have status.  The hilltop is easy to find--one can spot the gold dome from the medieval fortress by the river, the town's major tourist attraction. Be respectful about taking pictures as some are happier to show off their home than others.",roma mansions houses homes
131,Chisinau Jewish Cemetery,"Chisinau, Moldova",There is a mouldering Jewish cemetery hidden away in the capital of Moldova.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chisinau-jewish-cemetery,"In the outskirts of Moldova’s capital Chisinau, is a massive Jewish cemetery that lies in ruins. A little known fact, even for Moldovans living in Chisinau, is that a large Jewish cemetery can be found in the city. In the end of the 19th century there was a large Jewish community of about in Chisinau, accounting for nearly half of the Jewish population of Bessarabia. It was one of the most vibrant Jewish communities in the region. But that would all change. Tensions grew in the city and led to a small pogrom in 1903 that resulted in the tragic deaths of over 40 Jewish citizens. The 1930s marked the peak of Jewish life in Moldova. They had been granted citizenship in 1918 when Romania took control over Bessarabia and there were numerous Jewish schools and hospitals in the city. Unfortunately after 1941, around 147,000 Jewish Moldovans were deported to concentration camps, with a staggering 90,000 perishing. By the end of the 19th century there were around 25,000 graves at the cemetery but it all fell into despair after WWII, with many of the structures being destroyed by bombing. Today much of it is covered by thick vegetation and a number of the graves don’t seem to have been visited for decades.",graveyards cemeteries
132,Orheiul Vechi Cave Monastery,"Butuceny, Moldova",This 13th century Orthodox monastery is built right into the Moldovan cliffside.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/orheiul-vechi-cave-monastery,"The short marshrutka ride from Chişinău out to the village of Butuceni feels like traveling back in time, as drivers overtake locals in donkey carts on steep, frequently unpaved mountain roads. But the clock turns back even further in the impressive Orthodox cave monastery of Orheiul Vechi, which was dug into these rocky cliffs by local monks in the 13th century. The medieval icons below are illuminated only by candlelight and by jagged windows chiseled out of the cliff face, giving the impression that not much has changed since then. Behind the monastery, a small passage opens up onto a narrow ledge within the cliffs, providing an impressive view over the valley. The cave monastery is part of a larger archeological park in and around Butuceni, but it is by far its most impressive site. Medieval church ruins and even small museums can also be found around the village and are marked with clear signs. Other man-made cave complexes can also be spotted in the surrounding cliffs, but are generally only accessible to climbers.  Accessible via marshrutka from Chişinău's main bus station (the ones labeled 'Butuceni' or 'Orheiul Vechi', but NOT the ones labeled just 'Orheiul', which is a different village!). Get off at Butuceni. The marschrutka schedule can be awkward, so plan the timing of your return trip in advance. Parking is also available for those with personal transportation. As an orthodox holy site, modest dress (i.e. no shorts or tank tops for either sex) is expected. Female visitors are asked to cover their heads when entering the monastery, and this policy is enforced. Food and drinks are available from nearby guesthouses in the village of Butuceni.",cliffs monasteries medieval architecture
133,Romanita Collective Housing Tower,"Chisinau, Moldova","Once the tallest building in Chisinau, this unique tower is a relic of Soviet architecture.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/romanita-tower,"The building, popularly called Romanita (“Romashka”) because of its resemblance to a flower, was once the tallest residential building in Chisinau. The stone flower rises on Mala Malina. In the 1980s, Romanita was one of the city’s most ambitious housing projects. A strange elongated shape, a futuristic “flying saucer” on the roof, a spiral staircase inside, and apartments arranged in a circle. Designed and built between 1978 and 1986, the project was the work of architect Oleg Vronsky and engineer A. Marian. Romanita stands 73 meters (240 feet) tall, with 165 apartments spread over 22 floors. Until 1997, the building was considered a dormitory, and then the legal status of the building was changed to a “residential building.” They say that in 1980 Vronsky received an order from the USSR Ministry of Construction to design a sanatorium for employees of the ministry. But history says that the ministry had more ambitious plans: there was to be a banquet hall, a cinema, a gymnasium, a library, and a restaurant on the very top of the house, which would rotate around its axis. But the architect himself has destroyed this myth: first, there is not enough space for a restaurant, and second, nothing should rotate—there was no access to such technology in Chisinau at the time. Another myth says that Romanita was conceived as a hotel and was supposed to bring income to the treasury. Regardless of which myth is closer to the truth, Romanita was built and commissioned for the more social needs of the time: housing stock.",soviet architecture flowers towers houses architecture

It’s off the beaten path, and visitors will have to have to climb through an opening in the fence to find the monument since it’s tucked back near the Madison Park banquet hall. Originally, the statue was built in 1949 and was situated outside the Government House, but in 1991, it was dismantled and moved. Overall, the monument has seen its better days. Some of the tiles in the front are missing and most are loose, but overall, it is still intact and worth the visit.",monuments sculptures history & culture
135,Chisinau State Circus,"Chisinau, Moldova",This abandoned Soviet circus is slowly being restored to its Communist-era glory.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chisinau-state-circus,"An abandoned Communist-era circus in Moldova, the poorest country in Europe, is once again coming to life. The Chişinău State Circus was officially opened in 1981 and was, at the time, a top circus entertainment venue with state-of-the-art equipment and spaces for rehearsals, animals, and veterinarians. It had a capacity of 1,900 seats and the ring was over 40 feet across, making it the largest auditorium in Moldova. Circus artists would travel from near and far (Belarus, China, Finland, Germany, Russia, Ukraine etc.) to perform there, and at its peak, 57 concerts were held there in the space of a year. The Moldovan independence and the introduction of a market economy initially led to a rapid inflation resulting in a serious economic crisis. Still, today, Moldova is the poorest country in Europe, even though the economy has recovered and is growing steadily. Under these circumstances there was no room for a circus and the venue was abandoned in 2004. Luckily, a decade later, on the 30th of May, 2014, Circul came back to life. A long restoration process funded mainly by the Ministry of Culture had been going on for years and finally a smaller venue was opened in the building. There’s now room for 300 people sitting in the round, and features shows including clowns, gymnasts, acrobats, and exotic animals in classic circus fashion. After being forgotten for a decade the Chişinău State Circus is once again slowly waking to life, restoring its past glory and bringing joy and entertainment to a new generation of Moldovans.",brutalism circus abandoned
