0,Gardens by the Bay,Singapore,Singapore's landscaping project is home to 18 incredible Supertrees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gardens-by-the-bay,"Along Singapore’s Marina Bay, a landscaping project known as Gardens by the Bay hopes to beautify the marina and help transform the dense city-state into a “city in the garden.” But with futuristic design features that border on otherworldly, this garden is unlike any you’ve seen before. Due to their sheer height and fantastical appearance, Gardens by the Bay’s defining feature is almost certainly its collection of 18 “Supertrees.” With heights ranging from 80 to 160 feet and light displays that come alive at night, the Supertrees complement the nearby high-rises and add distinctive flair to the Singapore skyline. As you may have guessed, these trees are not trees in the traditional sense, but rather a series of man-made frames which house both greens and green technology. Roughly 200 species of orchids, ferns, and other tropical climbers scale the Supertrees’ trunks, forming a lush, colorful skin. In some regards the Supertrees imitate the functions of regular trees: absorbing and redistributing heat, collecting and filtering rainwater, and providing shade with their expansive canopies. Eleven of the trees are outfitted with either solar panels, which power the Supertree Grove’s lighting displays, or ventilation systems used to capture exhaust from the park’s greenhouses. Visitors can get an up-close look at these mechanical marvels from a 72-foot-high walkway known as the OCBC Skyway. The Supertrees, though probably the park’s most visually commanding features, are by no means the only impressive attraction at Gardens by the Bay; the garden complex is also home to two enormous greenhouses, as well as several outdoor gardens and lakes. The Flower Dome supports thousands of varieties of cool-dry climate plants and flowers, while the nearby Cloud Forest fosters plants that prefer wet conditions found on mountains and tropical highlands. Both of these greenhouses use sustainable technologies to minimize the their environmental impact. In addition to incorporating elements of the natural world into Singapore’s city life, Singapore’s government hopes the project will attract ecotourists from around the world.  While there is an entrance fee for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, the outdoor gardens including the Supertree Grove are free. Don’t miss the spectacular light and sound show that takes place at the Supertree Grove at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. every night. The gardens are open 5:00 a.m.-2:00 a.m. daily, but are not illuminated in the early morning. The Supertree lights are turned off at midnight.",strange science horticulture instruments of science plants
1,Singapore's Rooftop Pool,Singapore,The largest pool at its elevation sits on top of one of the most expensive resorts in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/singapore-rooftop-pool,"The Singapore skyline boasts the largest swimming pool of any other skyline in the world. The massive pool sits on the 57th floor, above the three 55-story high hotel towers of the Marina Bay Sands Resort, an integrated resort property whose construction project was the most expensive of its kind. The design, conceptualized by the resort’s architect Moshe Safdie, was inspired by a deck of playing cards, appropriate, as one of the hotel’s main attractions is its large casino. The pool’s vanishing edge gives the appearance of an abrupt cut-off at 650 feet in the air; however, just below the top edge is another trough-like basin which catches the water and returns it to the main pool. Measuring 478 feet long, almost three Olympic swimming pools in length, the SkyPark pool is the world’s largest infinity-edge pool at that height. There is also a restaurant, bar, spa, and botanical garden with 250 species of trees and 650 plants, and an observation deck which costs 23 SGD (or around 18 USD) to enjoy. Please note you cannot swim or relax at the poolside unless you are a hotel guest. Marina Bay Sands is linked directly to Bayfront Station on the Circle Line and Downtown Line of Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) train system. MRT services to/from Bayfront Station operate daily from (approximately) 6:00am to midnight.",places to stay Unique Restaurants & Bars water
2,Haw Par Villa,Singapore,A Buddhist theme park brings you a Buddhist version of Hell.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haw-par-villa,"Mentioning Haw Par Villa to Chinese Singaporeans may raise an eyebrow or two, and will likely lead to a conversation about how they were forced to go there as children in order to learn about good morals, the consequences of their actions, and to see the horrors they may face in the afterlife, should they stray. Casually referred to as a “Buddhist amusement park”, Haw Par Villa is actually a very graphic and educational journey through the hodgepodge of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism that constitute the traditional fabric of Chinese life, legend, spirituality and morality – along with a smattering of references to Singaporean history and their relationship to the world around them – spelled out in greater than life-size plaster dioramas. The villa was created in 1937 as “Tiger Balm Gardens” by Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, the makers of the medicinal ointment known as Tiger Balm, as a way to give back to the community and to pass on the beliefs and values of Chinese culture to the uninitiated. After many years of additions – many were dubious and short lived – and changes (some statues were moved to the Chinese Garden in western Singapore), the sprawling grounds still feature hundreds of huge dioramas (some of which are large enough to walk into), and over a thousand wonderfully rendered statues. As you walk through the park you will come across a beautiful koi and turtle pond that is a great spot to take a break, feed the fish and relax amongst the bridges, pagodas and, incongruously, the Statue of Liberty. You can easily spend an entire afternoon losing yourself in this plaster maze of mythology posing with the Monkey King and Sumo wrestlers, or the very, very bloody battle between rabbits and rats, but be mindful to save some time for the highlight of your trip: Buddhist Hell. Loosely based on Buddhist notions of Hell, the Ten Courts of Hell Cave uniquely illustrates the cultural synthesis of Buddhist and other mythologies that is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. viewable in all of its surrealistic beauty and spooky lighting. You will be treated to a very graphic, up close and personal account of what you have to look forward to as a result of your transgressions in this life. Not to give any of it away, but who knew being reincarnated was so involved, or so brutal? A walk back to feed the turtles may be in order after this, or maybe a visit to the gift shop. Tiger Balm soothes all aches…  Taxi: A quick ride from downtown, but it's also a straight shot from HarbourFront MRT (NE1), which makes it an easy side trip if you plan on visiting VivoCity or Sentosa. Train: A MRT stop on the Circle Line named Haw Par Villa (CC25) takes you to the front gate. Bus: Take SBS Transit bus 200 from Buona Vista MRT Station (EW21), SBS Transit bus 10, 30, SMRT Bus 188 from HarbourFront Centre, SBS Transit bus 143 from Orchard Road, SBS Transit bus 51 from Chinatown, or SBS Transit bus 175 from Clementi MRT Stn/Temporary Bus Interchange. Tickets: Note that while there is no cost to check out Haw Par Villa, there is an admission fee to see the Ten Courts of Hell, which is part of Hell's Museum. It's 18 SGD for adults and 10 SGD for children (free for those aged 6 and under). If you want to pay using a credit/debit card, you can purchase your tickets in advance via their website.",purveyors of curiosities repositories of knowledge amusement parks crime and punishment rites and rituals outsider architecture monuments sacred spaces statues architectural oddities architecture
3,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum,Singapore,This $62 million dollar temple was erected to house one little dental fragment of religious history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buddha-tooth-relic-temple-museum,"Completed in 2007, this $62 million complex is a popular tourist attraction in Singapore’s vibrant Chinatown. That may seem like quite an investment to honor a fragment of bone, but the tooth purportedly belongs to one of the most famous religious figures in history—the Buddha. The temple claims that the tooth is a relic recovered in 1980 from a collapsed stupa in Myanmar, but little additional information has been provided. Experts have called into question the authenticity of the tooth, saying that it is most likely “the tooth of a cow or water buffalo, but definitely not a human.” The tooth is located on the fourth story of the temple in the Sacred Light Chamber. It is only available for viewing during certain hours, so be sure to check the website before you go. Photography is strictly forbidden inside the relic chamber. Even if you miss the tooth, the temple itself is very impressive, featuring multiple floors of buddha statues, nagas (the popular Southeast Asian dragon-snakes that guard sacred relics), and impressive ceremonial venues in which to pray and meditate. There are a handful of other temples that claim to have tooth relics, including the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka.",buddha's tooth relics relics and reliquaries buddhism temples museums
4,Hawker Chan Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle,Singapore,This Singaporean food-court stall was home to the world's cheapest Michelin-starred meal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hawker-chan-soya-sauce-chicken-rice-and-noodle,"To eat a Michelin-starred meal in Singapore, one of the most expensive places in the world, you’ll usually need a reservation and a week’s pay. For Chan Hon Meng’s soya sauce chicken rice, you’ll need $3. Do expect to stand in line for an hour or two, though. The Malaysian-born chef dropped out of school at 15 to help his parents on their pig, duck, and vegetable farm. He decided he wanted to work in the kitchen in his 20s, and began training in Hong Kong. The techniques and recipes he learned there became the cornerstone of the food-court stall he opened with his wife, Irene, in Singapore in 2009. Every day, he makes his secret Cantonese-style, soya sauce–based marinade from scratch (without divulging all of its ingredients, he concedes to adding Chinese angelica roots, cloves, coriander, and star anise). He marinates 180 chickens overnight before braising and hanging them in his stall-front before service opens. The accompanying rice is fried in chicken fat and boiled in chicken stock. While he sells char siew noodles, pork rib, and hor fun noodles, the chicken is his stall’s major draw. When Michelin representatives phoned Meng in 2016, inviting him to the Michelin Guide Singapore Gala Dinner, he thought they were kidding. The representative insisted that the awards were selected based on food rather than venue. With that, Meng’s stall became the home of the world’s most affordable Michelin-starred meal. In the year after earning his star, he opened a full restaurant in the mall next to the food court, as well as several others, as far away as Thailand and Taiwan, with plans slated for Melbourne, as well. While he has aspirations to sell his chicken around the world, he refuses to compromise on its accessibility and flavor, hoping each plate of chicken tastes exactly as it does in the original humble food court stall that won him culinary acclaim.",malaysia awards hong kong sauce noodles rice chickens street food
5,Henderson Waves,Singapore,The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore looks like a series of undulating waves rising between two public parks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/henderson-waves,"The city-state of Singapore is the greenest city in Asia according to the Green City Index. The green cover of the so-called Garden City is almost at 50 percent, and the lush environments are supported by a focus on renewable energy and future sustainability. Part of this interconnected system is the Southern Ridges, a 6.2-mile (10-kilometer) trail in the south of the city. And this is where you’ll find the Henderson Waves, the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. The idea for the Southern Ridges was conceived in 2002. Its aim was to connect a series of parks located along the southern ridge of Singapore, with one trail running between the Mount Faber, Telok Blangah Hill, and Kent Ridge parks and the Labrador Nature Reserve. To achieve this, local authorities commissioned a number of architecturally striking pedestrian bridges and walkways to connect the different green spaces, at a cost of S$25.5 million (US $18.5 million). The Henderson Waves, completed in 2008, is the most impressive of all the bridges along the trail. It connects Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park, stretching for 899 feet (274 meters) and reaching a height of 118 feet (36 meters) above Henderson Road. The bridge’s most notable feature is its organic wave-like design. The walkway itself is formed by slats of yellow Balau wood, sourced from certified sustainable timber farms in East Malaysia, and around this flow the “waves.” The waves are formed by seven undulating curved steel ribs that at various stages rise over or beneath the walkway. In some sections, the wave flows high over the bridge forming alcoves that provide sheltered seating areas for passing pedestrians. The bridge was designed to integrate with the green areas around it. At the same time, it was made with multifunctionality in mind. Not only does it connect two green spaces, it also provides a recreational experience in its own right. It’s a popular destination for joggers and walkers, as well as couples and families who come to sit in the shaded alcoves. People come to enjoy the panoramic views of the city, harbor, and Southern Islands, while bird watchers walk the bridge to spot the various birds that can be seen in the surrounding canopy. And at night a different experience awaits. Every day between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. the bridge is illuminated with LED lights, creating a wave of light that flows through the Singapore night.  Henderson Waves is located in the south of Singapore. It crosses over Henderson Road and connects Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park. You can get there by taking the bus (number 145) to the stop on Henderson Road right beneath the bridge. From here you’ll find a staircase going up to the bridge. Alternatively, you can get the bridge from Mount Faber. From the cable car station on Faber Peak, it’s a 15 to 20 minute walk to Henderson Waves.",urban planning trails infrastructure transportation bridges parks architectural oddities architecture
6,Changi Airport Slides,Singapore,The busy transport hub is home to the tallest airport slide in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/changi-airport-slides,"“Fun” is a rarely used adjective when it comes to air travel, but Changi Airport has long endeavored to change that. With above-and-beyond amenities such as a rooftop swimming pool and an indoor jungle space known as the Jewel, it’s no surprise that the transport hub was voted the best of its kind in Skytrax’s 2019 World Airport Awards—a title that Changi has held on to for seven consecutive years. Among Changi Airport’s most functional wonders are two giant slides that send travelers to their gates with as much speed as amusement. Unveiled in Terminal 3 in 2010, the original slide towers over 39 feet high across four stories as the tallest slide in Singapore and a record-holder among airports. With dims yet to be confirmed, the newer of the two slides is located in Terminal 4, and empties out near a five-story netted play area known as the “Red Chandelier.” But it’s not all fun and games—terms and conditions apply. In order to access either slide, travelers have to have spent a minimum of $10 at a shop or restaurant in Changi Airport that day, and passengers can redeem up to 10 joyrides within 24 hours. For those who skew toward the traditional, stairs and escalators are still a classic means of reaching each gate.  The slides are open to travelers between 12 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. The $10 that passengers are required to have spent in the airport excludes medical clinics, Crowne Plaza Hotel fees, currency exchange fees, and a Jewel cash card. In order to gain access to the Changi Airport slides, participants must be between four and six and a half feet tall.",playgrounds airports transportation architectural oddities architecture
7,The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,Singapore,Terrapins of all colors and shapes are quick to bring fascination (and possibly long life) at this museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-live-turtle-and-tortoise-museum-singapore,"Located inside Lorong Chencharu, ORTO,  the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum in Singapore hosts more than 800 turtles and tortoises across more than 50 different species. The menagerie is surprisingly colorful and diverse with varieties such as the long-necked snake-headed turtles, the otherworldy mata-mata, and the regal golden soft-shell turtle. The hard-shelled reptiles are spread out in pools, ponds, and tanks where visitors can view the living specimens. There are vegetables for purchase to feed the creatures, but anyone wishing to get up close and personal with the turtles is advised that they may mistake your fingers for carrots. In addition to the zoo collection, the museum has thousands of terrapin-shaped ceramics, dishes, furniture pieces, and knick-knacks of all sorts. In Japanese tradition, turtles represent long life and good fortune, so if you are lucky, a visit to The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum might not just be educational, but also life-extending.   Five to 10 minute walk from Khatib MRT. Closed on Tuesdays. Open 10 am to 6 pm daily.",turtles wildlife sanctuaries zoos natural wonders collections nature animals museums
8,Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,Singapore,This rare wildlife haven in Singapore feels like you're in the tropical rainforest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sungei-buloh-wetland-reserve,"Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a fresh spark of natural greenery and rich biodiversity, something which is largely uncommon in Singapore. The unique rustic charm is especially beautiful around the mangrove areas. In many ways, it almost feels like you’re entering the tropical rainforest of Malaysia or Indonesia. But in fact you are here in the far northwestern area of Singapore in a unique wildlife haven. Sungei Buloh, Singapore’s first ASEAN Heritage Park, has its trails pass through coastal areas, forest trails, mid-canopy walks and migratory bird trails. The entire route covers the distance of 3,700 meters. The reserve is an important stopover point for over 150 species of exotic migratory birds from as far as Alaska, Siberia, Northern China and Australia, making this an important ecological site forming the East Asian Australasian Shorebird Site Network. Other than migratory birds, many distinctive fauna can be found along the wetland. One of the most frequent animal sightings is the infamous Malayan water monitor lizard, which is huge enough that some people confuse them with the Komodo dragon. For expert guidance, learn and explore with experienced guides by joining the free guided walks that are conducted at the reserve every weekend. - The best way to get to Sungei Buloh is by boarding Kranji Express from Kranji MRT Station, which operates 8.30-17.45 everyday.
- Migratory birds are best spotted during September-March period. Make sure you bring a binocular so that you can observe these unique birds from a respectful distance.
- Singapore's well-conditioned and hygienic indoor environment may make you forget that it's still in Southeast Asia after all. Humid, hot environment is to be expected in Sungei Buloh, so wear breathable clothes and bring insects repellent.",wildlife sanctuaries nature animals
9,World's First Salmon ATM,Singapore,"Frozen in Norway, vended in Singapore.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-first-salmon-atm,"In January of 2019, a new ATM was unveiled in Singapore’s Wisteria shopping mall. Instead of cash, however, this machine dispenses 200-gram fillets of frozen salmon from the fjords of Norway. Today, dozens of salmon ATMs dot the island city-state. Manish Kumar, founder and CEO of Norwegian Salmon Pte Ltd, has a stated goal of making his beloved salmon available to all and affordable for everyone. By cutting out the cost of storefronts, staff, and distributors, he’s able to sell his fillets for S$5.90 ($4.25). And by holding them under -4 degrees F in each vending machine, the fish stays fresh for up to two years. Thanks to promising first quarter sales, though, it’s unlikely any fillets will stick around that long. The company decided on Singapore because of the country’s vending-machine culture (Singaporean machines vend everything from ice cream to luxury cars) and affection for Norwegian salmon. With locations in shopping malls, commercial areas, housing condominiums, and suburban areas, Norwegian salmon is now available to salmon-loving Singaporeans in 61 locations, 24/7. In an interview with RiceMedia, Kumar noted, with apparent satisfaction, “There have been many cases where customers buy salmon after midnight.”  The ATMs do not take cash, and the fish is dispensed frozen. The original ATM is located on the first floor of the Wisteria Mall.",vending machines fish
10,House of Tan Teng Niah,Singapore,"This house is one of the most colorful in the country, and is the last remaining example of a historic villa.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-tan-teng-niah,"This vividly colorful house was constructed in 1900 by a local businessman named Tan Teng Niah. At the time, the neighborhood was an industrial zone (Tan’s candy and rubber factories were located nearby) and many of Singapore’s ethnic-Chinese businessmen lived in similar villas. Amid Singapore’s rapid economic growth and social change during the 20th century, the neighborhood evolved into what is now known as Little India. Most of the old merchant houses were razed to make way for modern commercial buildings and sleek skyscrapers. However, the Tan Teng Niah house survived, and during the 1980s, it underwent a full restoration to what people see today. Believed to be the last such house in existence, it’s now preserved under landmark status from the National Heritage Board. Although the house’s historical background is interesting, the key to its popularity among locals and visitors is its current appearance. The exterior is painted in a rainbow riot of vivid colors, with every element—each individual slat, molding, panel, and pilaster—in a different hue than its neighbor. An array of sky blue, avocado green, traffic-cone orange, highlighter yellow, and nail-polish pink shades adorns the house. Further embellishments beyond the psychedelic color-palette include gilded Chinese calligraphy, intricate floral lunettes, and a bamboo-tiled roof. The house is now used as a commercial space, and recent tenants have included a pharmacy and a business training school. Quite the ordinary activities, within one of the most extraordinary buildings in Singapore.  The house of Tan Teng Niah is located at 37 Kerbau Road, a block away from Little India MRT Station.",buildings outsider art houses homes architecture
11,Katong Antique House,Singapore,This jam-packed Singapore antique museum preserves the fading remnants of a uniquely mixed culture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/katong-antique-house,"Decorated with intricately painted green tiles and painted a cheery yellow, the Katong Antique House is a treasure trove of Peranakan antiques. The two-storied shop house is located in Katong area in the east of Singapore, where many old Peranakan families live. Run by Mr. Peter Wee, a fourth generation Peranakan, the Katong Antique House is more than a museum for Baba-Nyonya artifacts and a shop selling Peranakan goods, it is a tableau of the Peranakan presence in Singapore. The Peranakans refer to the descendants of Chinese who immigrated to the Malayan Peninsula and the Indonesia Archipelago between the 13th and 15th century. These immigrants adopted some Malay customs and traditions while retaining some of their own; some say they retained the original Chinese traditions much better than the Chinese who remained in China as they were unaffected by the eradication of culture during the Cultural Revolution. They eventually went on to develop their own culture and language based on that of their adopted countries. When Singapore was colonized in 1819, some Peranakans moved to the tiny island state and befriended the English colonialists, thus beginning their history in Singapore which Mr. Peter Wee has spent his life striving to preserve. Adorning the walls of the old shophouse inherited from Wee’s maternal grandfather are Peranakan prints and portraits. Peranakan crockery, costumes, and furniture fill the space. The influences and origins of the Peranakan culture are evident in these antiques. The baju panjangs (long dress) and batik sarongs are reminiscent of the native Malay dresses. The intricate kasot manek, handmade shoes with beaded designs, have beautiful motifs of fish, flowers, phoenixes and dragons, similar to the motifs found in Chinese designs. These motifs are found all over the furniture in the store, in the legs of tables and sides of cupboards, each associated with something the Chinese value like prosperity, fertility, longevity and wealth. Wee has dedicated most of his life salvaging these treasures from the bins of Peranakan families whose young do not know of their family histories. His small museum-store preserves the remnants of Peranakan heritage abandoned by the unsentimental nature of the modern local. If you are ever in Singapore, this place is a must for those wishing to examine an integral part of Singapore history before it fades into history.",eccentric homes homes museums and collections museums
12,Keppel Hill Reservoir,Singapore,A former reservoir that was only recently discovered after more than 60 years of disuse.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/keppel-hill-reservoir,"Situated on a small hill that leads up to Mt Faber, the abandoned Keppel Hill Reservoir serves as a hidden sanctuary for thrill-seekers and urban explorers. Although its origins are unknown, it dates back more than a century, yet was absent from official maps for decades until it came to the attention of the National Heritage Board and local media in 2014. Roughly one-third the size of an Olympic swimming pool, the enclosed body of water once served the needs of nearby residents, although its use shifted from hydration to swimming and leisure. The remnants of a diving board are still visible, and maps from the era of Japanese Occupation label the area as a swimming pool. Just as the reservoir may have brought bouts of laughter and enjoyment, it was also the site of some tragedy: Newspaper reports from the mid-1900s note several deaths due to drowning. Emerging out of the jungle, the reservoir feels like a secret, if not a fairy tale. Nonetheless, it fell into disuse, possibly because its paltry size made it an ineffective water source. Today it is overrun by vegetation and overhanging branches that can exude a menacing aura. Still, the Keppel Hill Reservoir is evidence that much remains to be discovered even in the dense urban jungle that is Singapore, and that such landscapes still exist in the liminal space between public consciousness and history.  From Harbourfront MRT station, a 15-minute walk will take you to Wishart Rd. Turn right and walk up Keppel Hill. At the fork, take a left and follow the stone path all the way into the foliage where you will be greeted by the sight of the Keppel Hill Reservoir. Turning right at the fork would lead you to 11 Keppel Hill, which was formerly known as Keppel House. While the site is in a public park, local authorities advise caution when exploring, as the reservoir has not been prepared for visitors and has potential to support wildlife. As of 2019, the organization My Heritage offers a tour that includes a visit to the reservoir.",reservoir cities water
13,Bukit Brown Cemetery,Singapore,One of the largest Chinese cemeteries outside of China spent years overgrown and forgotten.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bukit-brown-cemetery,"While exact numbers are not available, an estimated 100,000 people lie buried within the 0.86 square kilometers (212 acres) that comprise Bukit Brown Cemetery. However, final resting places are not so final in this crowded city-state, and now this unique cemetery set aside for Singapore’s Chinese residents faces disruption to meet the relentless demands of development. Originally owned by private Chinese clans for burials, the site became an official municipal cemetery in 1922. However, the new plots sat dormant for months despite the pressing need for burial grounds, as the Europeans that laid out the cemetery did not take into account the feng shui requirements of Chinese burial plots and thus had to re-plot much of the land. As several million Chinese migrants either passed through or settled in Singapore, Bukit Brown Cemetery is a significant feature of the city’s cultural history. Many famous Singaporeans (of all classes and statuses) are buried there, drawing from very diverse origins including Hokkien, Hainanese, Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew. The tombs range from the tiny to the impressively grand. Beautiful, unique Peranakan tiles adorn many of the graves, attracting attention and study from ceramic experts from around the world. Laying largely dormant since 1973, Bukit Brown Cemetery has become overgrown and forgotten. Now that construction of an eight-lane highway promises to necessitate the exhumation and relocation of thousands of bodies, efforts are underway to plot and record all of the cemetery’s residents. This is, however, a difficult task, as documentation is very limited, and new tombs are still being discovered. In addition, Bukit Brown Cemetery is also known for its lush greenery which serves as a home for a wide array of animals such the Changeable Hawk Eagle, the Large Flying Fox and other threatened species. The Friends of Bukit Brown (aka the “Brownies”) are working hard to raise awareness about this precious cultural heritage site. Bukit Brown MRT Station is easy to get to. Wear pants if you want to explore; the bulk of the place is untended, overgrown grounds. Wear sunscreen and bug spray and bring lots of water.

14,CHIJMES,Singapore,A historical convent known for taking in bad luck babies left on its doorstep is now an upscale shopping center.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chijmes,"The bustling civics district of Singapore contains a plethora of historical and religious sites that have been converted into museums and galleries for tourism and heritage purposes. The one site that stands out most is the CHIJMES (pronounced as “chimes”) said to be Singapore’s version of London’s Covent Gardens. Designed by George Coleman, CHIJMES (Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus Middle Education School) is a huge complex of buildings of great architectural diversity, ranging from Anglo French Gothic to Neoclassical. All over the complex are intricately designed metal staircases, handmade stained glass windows and tall grand spires. Although CHIJMES has features of such grandeur, its beginnings were more humble than what its exterior would suggest. CHIJMES started out as a convent school set up in 1854 by French nuns of the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, a religious institute of Religious Sisters founded by the French Minim friar, Father Nicholas Barré. At the request of Father Beurel the priest of the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, the institute sent a group of nuns to set up a school for girls in Penang and Singapore. The Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus had a mission to help the disadvantaged in this South East Asian island. It served as a school, pioneering education for girls in a time when many locals were poor and education for girls was not considered important. It also served as an orphanage as many poor families could not afford to keep all their children. One of the most famed features of the former convent is the modest Gate of Hope. While the small grey door may seem less grand than expected, it was a symbol of hope for many of the babies who were left there. Due to poverty, many families left usually female babies there for the nuns of the convent to care for. Female babies born in the Year of the Tiger were also often abandoned there as well by Chinese families who believed that female Tiger babies brought bad luck. These orphans were given a free education and home within the walls of this convent. Another famed feature would be the first building of the complex, Caldwell House which originally served as the residence of a Senior Magistrate’s Clerk before being bought by the sisters to serve as their headquarters. The other buildings were added around it in later years to become what was colloquially known as the Town Convent. However part of the original nuns’ quarters was demolished to make way for SMRT(Singapore Mass Rapid Transit) offices. Even though the nuns eventually moved out of the school in 1984, they did not stop helping the disadvantaged and educating the girls of Singapore. Before their final year in the Town Convent, the nuns had set up various convents for primary and secondary education all over Singapore, each bearing the name of the Holy Infant Jesus, from CHIJ St Nicholas to CHIJ Kellock in the years before. Today it serves as a high end retail complex of shops, bars and restaurants and hence revamped as CHIJMES, a play on words using the original name of the convent CHIJ. Its beautiful Gothic chapel is often used as an entertainment venue for parties and weddings. CHIJMES won a Merit Award in the UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2002. While 160-year-old CHIJMES has not been a place of learning and sanctuary in years, this place still holds great value in the hearts of many convent girls and is an integral part of Singapore’s history.",malls unesco shops churches sacred spaces
15,German Girl Shrine,Singapore,A Singapore shrine to an unnamed German girl who has become a local deity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/german-girl-shrine,"Nestled in the lalang grass of Pulau Ubin, a tiny island off the coast of Singapore, is a small mysterious yellow hut that houses the century-old German Girl Shrine. The hut contains an altar with eerie feminine items like nail polish, brushes and lipstick, offerings to the German girl represented by the doll encased in a box at the center of the altar. The shrine was made to store the remains of a German girl who lived and died before WWI. Her parents had owned a plantation on the island. Before the war broke out, the British came upon the island and rounded up the plantation owner and his family. The daughter, believed to be about 18 years old, escaped the British but not death as she fell off a cliff into a quarry. Her body was found the next day by the Boyanese who had worked for her father. Out of respect, they buried her. Years later, locals took her remains and her silver crucifix and stored it in an urn they placed in the shrine. Over time, the girl in the shrine somehow became a Taoist deity in the eyes of the people, stranger still since the girl had likely been Roman Catholic when she was alive. The shrine became known to gamblers all over the region, attracting those from the mainland and Malaysia who still make offerings of nail polish and dolls for blessings of luck and health from the German girl. In 1974, quarry company Aik Hwa gifted the shrine with a Jiangsu urn to store the girl’s remains, but tragically the urn was later stolen by vandals, along with the remains of the German girl and her silver crucifix. Although many know that her remains are likely no longer on the island, the German girl’s worshippers and devotees still believe that her soul and powers are still active on the island whose history she had become a part of.

16,St. Joseph's Church,Singapore,The first Catholic church in Singapore is a Neo-Gothic colossus with a rich architectural history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-joseph-s-church,"Surrounded by crowded shopping centers and glassy corporate buildings is a small sanctuary of calm in the busy Central Business District of Singapore called St Joseph’s Church. Declared a national monument in 2005, this little white church accented with sky blue was the first Catholic Church in Singapore. Like many old churches, St Joseph’s is built in the shape of the Latin cross. Built to accommodate 1,500 worshippers, the architect of the church was D. McLeod Craik. The Neo-Gothic architectural style is evident in decorative architectural elements of the windows and roof. All over the church are marble statues and altars. There are also Portuguese azulejos (decorative tiles) on the walls of the church portraying the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima. The main altar for St Joseph and another dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes were crafted by the Milanese firm Fratelli Barttarelli. The altars of Our Lady of Fatima and St Anthony were crafted by the Italian firm Bertelli. The original statue of Fatima was donated by prominent Portuguese parishioner Dr Caetano Xavier Furtado whose descendants still attend the church. It was an exact replica of the pilgrim statue from Rome that visited Singapore in 1950 and made by Portuguese sculptor Avelino Moreira Vinhas. This statue was eventually replaced. Splashes of colour in the church come in the form of the handmade Italian stained glass windows depicting various saints, each costing $1200 and coming from the donations of various families and communities such as the community of Goa or the Shepherdson family. One particular window of Saint Catherine was donated by the architect of the building D. M. Craik in memory of his daughter Katherine who died at sea. Outside the church is the grotto dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima. Established in 1853, the church was named after St Joseph by its first priest Francisco da Silva Pinto e Maia who arrived 30 June 1825. The priest had previously been conducting mass at the Beach Road residence of his friend, Dr Jose d’Almeida from 1825 to1833 and a small chapel from 1833 to 1853. Using the land acquired from Samuel George Bonham, Assistant to the Resident of Singapore, Fr Maia had the church built. He named it after St Joseph because prior to his arrival in Singapore, he had been a professor at St Joseph’s Seminary in Macao prior to coming to Singapore and the land and houses bought in Singapore had been paid for with funds from China’s Portuguese Mission in China, whose procuration house was St Joseph’s College in Macau. However, Fr Maia fell ill and passed away in 1850, before the project was completed. His remains are placed beneath the main altar. His successor, Vincente de Santa Catarina took over and the church was blessed and opened in 1853. In 1906, the church was demolished and rebuilt. The current building was completed in 1912 by Swan & MacLaren with D. M. Craik. In 1981, the control of the church was passed from the Portuguese Mission to the ordinary jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Singapore, ceasing to be a parish church and becoming a church of devotion. Today, while the last Portuguese priest ended his term in 1999, the church still observes a number of Portuguese traditions. It still attracts Catholics from all around the island for its famed annual Good Friday procession. Yet the numbers of regular parishioners are dwindling as the old Catholic families move farther and farther away from the church which is situated in the Central Business District, leaving the church quieter and quieter as the years go by.",churches sacred spaces architecture

They provide free (and yummy) Indian vegetarian meals, to the deep appreciation of the large population of South Asian migrant workers in Singapore’s construction industry. More than 600 breakfasts and lunches are served weekly to anyone who walks in, and they even provide dinners on Sundays when many of the workers get their day off and fill the streets of Little India. Most of these workers have meager salaries, and try to save as much money as possible to remit home. If you’ve got a morning free, hop in to help with some dicing and chopping of vegetables. You don’t need to have any professional culinary skills, and you might be surprised by who you get to meet over a plate of tasty dal (Indian lentil curry), briyani (a mixed rice dish), pakora (a perfectly spiced and crispy Indian snack), or a chef’s surprise based on what ingredients come in from the local food rescue organization helping to keep their kitchens stocked. Stay to taste the fruit of your labor, and leave a small donation if you can.  The nearest subway station is Little India.

18,Kampong Lorong Buangkok,Singapore,Singapore's last surviving traditional village is hidden among giant skyscrapers and modern infrastructure.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kampong-lorong-buangkok,"Singapore is the world’s most urban nation, with 100 percent of its population living in urban areas, according to UNESCO. But hidden beneath its towering skyscrapers and modern infrastructure is one low-lying hidden gem: the main island’s last surviving traditional village. Built in 1956 before Singapore’s economic boom, Kampong Lorong Buangkok’s 28 dwellings are home to families who live differently from nearly everyone else in the city-state. Located in Singapore’s northern suburbs, the kampong (village) contrasts sharply with the concrete high rises that house the majority of locals. The village, which is the size of two soccer fields, offers a window into what Singapore looked like before it became a global trade giant. Visit, and you’ll find colorful one-story houses, a canal, a small mosque, and winding dirt paths weaving through the town. The houses are made with zinc and wood roofs. Kampong Lorong Buangkok was settled by a mixture of Malaysians and Chinese. The residents enjoy a slower pace of life and strong sense of community. Although the village is somewhat isolated from urban Singapore, it still has electricity, running water, garbage collection, and a postal service. The village was established by Chinese medicine seller Sng Teow Koon as a plot of four to six homes. For rent, the residents pay upwards of $30 per month to his children. However, the land the village sits on is worth approximately $33 million, so some residents fear that the kampong may soon be paved over for a new development.  The village is accessible by buses 70 and 103, near the Church of St Vincent de Paul. Please be a conscientious visitor, as people still live here.",villages urban planning tradition houses homes
19,Bronze Bathers,Singapore,"The most playful of the life-sized statues that make up Singapore's ""People of the River.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bronze-bathers-singapore-quay,"Early life on the Singapore River was an innocent time, and while that time is now lost in the towering buildings and busy lifestyles of the modern-day city, the “People of the River” series of statues that line the water are a reminder of those carefree days. While there is a whole series of life-sized people doing everyday things, none evoke that feeling of uncomplicated living as the “Bronze Bathers.” The now bustling city was once a modest river settlement, and playing with Singapore’s open museum concept, local artists created the “People of the River” to create a window into the city’s history. Located in the Boat Quay, which back in the 1860s handled three-quarters of the shipping service, the bathers seem to elicit joy in all who see them. Five gleaming, life-sized chestnut-colored boys, naked as can be, are in different stages of leaping into the water. One throws his arms up as he falls through the air, another pushes his friend who is either to scared to jump or blocking the route. One boy sits on the ledge, contemplating his jump, and the fifth has just noticed the fun, and is climbing the fence to get in on the action. This piece, as well as the rest of the river people, can be found along the water of the Singapore River in the Boat Quay, positioned behind the Maybank Building and the Fullerton Hotel. A camera is suggested; it’s hard to resist silly or inappropriate photos when surrounded by nude life-sized statues. Take the MRT to Raffles Place Station (EW14/NS26) and walk towards Fullerton Hotel and Maybank Building.

However, along with the Little Mermaid of Copenhagen and the Manneken Pis statue of Brussels, it’s also known as one of the “Three Major Disappointments of the World.” The massive statue earned this moniker following its installment in 1972. Not long after, the statue’s pumping system jammed and stopped spouting water for nearly three decades. The front view of the fountain was also obscured from tourists by a bridge. The pump was fixed in 2002 and a new pedestrian bridge was later constructed for observation. Since these additions, the statue’s popularity has gradually returned. Despite its symbolic status, the Merlion is not based on local mythology. It was designed in 1964 by Alec Fraser-Brunner, a member of the Souvenir Committee and curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium. The symbol was originally the logo for the tourism board. It represents the island city-state of Singapore, inspired by the country’s history and name, which means “lion city.” In 2009, the Merlion was struck by lightning, but no one was hurt and the statue was restored in a month. Today, the structure has spawned numerous imitations across Asia. Although its water pump still jams from time to time, visitors won’t be disappointed by this magnificent structure.",fountains statues architectural oddities history & culture architecture
21,Japanese Cemetery Park,Singapore,"From prostitutes to soldiers to business men, the dead in this graveyard are a microcosm of Singapore's history with Japan.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/japanese-cemetery-park,"Untouched and enclosed, the Japanese Cemetery Park lies quietly in the residential area of Chuan Hoe Avenue. It receives little publicity in order to avoid angering the older generations of Singaporeans who survived the atrocities committed by the Japanese during World War II. Owned by the Japanese Association, it is the only cemetery that has never been in danger of demolition, exhumation or desecration by the Singapore government. Established in 1891, merchants, prostitutes and soldiers alike are buried in this park. The seven-acre piece of land on which it sits was formerly a rubber plantation owned by three brothel owners. The request of building a Japanese cemetery was approved by the British colonial government on 26 June 1891, and its management was handed to the Japanese-run Mutual Self-Help Society. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the majority of the Japanese population in Singapore was prostitutes, or karayuki-san, from the rural prefectures of Japan, hence half the graves in the cemetery are of Japanese prostitutes who died in Singapore or on the way back to Japan. Post-WWI, more Japanese merchants and businessmen started trade with Singapore. The more elaborate gravestones belong to them. Some notable Japanese people who were buried or memorialised there include Ueyama Kantaro, son of the inventor of the mosquito coil, and Futabatei Shimei, pioneer of realism in Japanese literature. During the Japanese Occupation in WWII, the Japanese took control of the cemetery. Military casualties were buried in the cemetery. After the Japanese surrender in 1946, the soldiers who committed suicide or were executed for war crimes were cremated there. When the British returned to govern Singapore, all Japanese were deported and none were allowed to return until the 1951 peace treaty. In 1952, the Japanese Consul-General to Singapore Ken Ninomiya requested a search for the remains of their war dead. As the remains were all buried together, identification was not possible. The Japanese government decided to fund the restoration of the cemetery instead. The cemetery features a stone garden and a prayer temple. There are also gravestones and memorials made by the prisoners of war for deceased generals and soldiers. Another highlight of the cemetery is the memorial stone of Terengganu-born Tani Yutaka, otherwise known as Harimau or the Tiger of Malaya. He was a secret agent for the Japanese military and has been depicted in Japanese novels and films. Since 1969, the cemetery has been owned by the Japanese Association. While the last burial in the Japanese Cemetery Park took place in 1973, but the park still has a caretaker by the name of Lim Geok Qi who took on the job after his father. Qi lives with his family on the cemetery land, maintaining the graves and serving as a guide for visitors looking into the rich and complicated history of Japan-Singapore relations.

Built in 1921, Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, or Bright Hill Temple, is a Buddhist temple complex founded by Venerable Zhuan Dao. Originally, the complex housed only two shrine halls. But after Venerable Hong Choon took over as abbot in 1947, the monastery expanded rapidly. Today, it sits on more than 800,000 square feet of land, roughly the size of 14 football fields. The complex also has many amenities, such as multiple prayer halls, bell and drum towers, a crematorium, and two columbaria. In 2006, the Buddhist College of Singapore opened on the compound, offering bachelor’s and master’s programs in Buddhism to English and Mandarin speakers. Between the Dharma Hall and the Pagoda of 10,000 Buddhas, visitors will find an enormous statue of the bodhisattva Guan Yin. One of Asia’s largest indoor Buddha statues—made from bronze, measuring 45 feet in height, and weighing many tons—sits in the nearby Hall of No Form. The grounds are large, with gardens and a Dragon Pond that are decorated during celebrations. You can also find a Bodhi tree next to the Hall of Amrita Precepts, the same species of tree under which Shakyamuni Buddha achieved enlightenment. Though it is often bursting with people during Buddhist celebrations such as Vesak Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival. Laypeople regularly visit the monastery to seek refuge from the large crowds and hectic pace of Singapore. On Sundays, and on the 1st, 15th, and 27th days of the lunar month, free vegetarian food is served in the dining hall.

Its name derives from its striking resemblance to Guilin in China. Little Guilin was once a quarry, supplying much of Singapore’s granite needs until it was abandoned in the 1980s. Rainwater collected in the depression over time, turning the quarry into a lake. In 1984, the Housing and Development Board developed Little Guilin into a park, which it still is today. Little Guilin is known to urban explorers and those living around the region, but it’s relatively unknown to most other Singaporeans.  Little Guilin is easily accessible by public transportation and is within walking distance from Bukit Gombak MRT Station (NS3).

Land where chewing gum is illegal and the only landfill is a tourist attraction. If you thought they’d have an unusual animal or two, you’d be correct. But rather than tuck them away in some difficult to reach forest or underwater cavern, Singapore displays its fantastic fauna right out in the open. One of the most intriguing? Quantula striata, the blinking snail. While Singapore isn’t the only place this terrestrial mollusk struts its stuff, it’s the perfect place to find one. This unassuming snail has a bland spiral shell, which in the daytime might not even catch your eye. But at night the snails blink, and the faster they move the faster they flicker on and off. They slow the blink a bit while eating, and when they’re asleep, it’s lights out. The flashes, which aren’t quite as bright as those of a firefly, are produced by the exotic-sounding “organ of Haneda” which is found in the “head” of the critter. Even its eggs glow. The snails are common after it rains, and prefer to hang out near human activity, especially lawns, fresh excavations, and garbage dumps. They’ll enjoy your garden if you give them the chance to dine on your lettuce and carrots. They also have a taste for rat food, should you wish to keep one as a pet.

Founded around 1827 by Naraina Pillai and constructed in Dravidian style (a distinctive architecture used in South India by Tamils), the temple is now designated as a National Monument. It’s also dedicated to Sri Mariamman, a folk goddess. The most outstanding feature of the Sri Mariamman Temple is the towering five-floored gopuram handing above the main entrance. Each floor is slightly smaller than the one below it, making the structure look higher than it actually appears. The gopuram is decorated with sculptures of Hindu mythology, including various deities, exotic beasts, and cultural figures. It’s believed that all of them were crafted by skilled artisans that were brought in from the Nagapattinam and Cuddalore districts in southern India. Another distinctive feature of the temple is the statue of Aravan, a deity that is always worshipped in the form of his severed head. He is said to have sacrificed himself during the great battles of the Mahabharata War.

It was built on the former grounds of a Chinese cemetery of the same name, which was established around 1870 and existed until 1979. The original Peck San Theng was one of the largest cemeteries in Singapore, covering 324 acres of land with an attached village, Kampong San Theng, home to some 2,000 residents. Life at the cemetery was colorful, dense with the pageantry of Cantonese death rituals. The pavilions alluded to in its name refer to the 12 pavilions erected to provide shelter for visitors. However, Peck San Theng also gained a reputation for lawlessness and gang activities. During the Japanese Occupation, the village functioned as a state within a state, largely left alone by the Japanese soldiers who were reportedly wary of the cemetery’s ghostly occurrences. The cemetery could not, however, escape the inevitability of Singapore’s urban redevelopment schemes. Land-scarce Singapore needed the sprawling acreage of Peck San Theng, and in 1978 the Housing Development Board reclaimed the land, exhuming 100,000 graves in four years to construct the modern estate of Bishan. The Cantonese and Hakka clan associations retained just eight of its original 324 hectares on which they rebuilt two temples and a community hall, essential components of life in Kampong San Theng. A museum was opened on the grounds in 2016 to tell the story of Peck San Theng. The most significant building in the modern Peck San Theng has to be the columbarium. It was designed by the renowned architect Tay Kheng Soon, who had recently designed the iconic modernist living space the Golden Mile Complex. Just as the living were rehoused from villages to high-rise public housing, the dead were exhumed, cremated, and interred in columbariums. Peck San Theng was one of the first. A starkly modernist columbarium was envisioned to reflect the novelty of this cremation to Chinese death rituals. Tay conceived of the columbarium as a hemi-hexagonal structure that resembled a traditional Chinese tomb. A series of cascading levels evoked the hills that gave the place its name. The Peck San Theng columbarium not only reflects the Chinese folk belief in continuity between one’s life and afterlife, but also codes in its design the cultural shifts in living practices that an entire population, including the dead, had undergone.  The columbarium is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and until 4 p.m. on weekends and public holidays. The heritage gallery is open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m, daily, and until 1 p.m. on public holidays.",columbariums villages urban planning cemeteries architecture

At Singapore’s Changi Airport, however, there’s a third option: Basking in a flurry of butterflies. Located in Terminal 3, the small, tropical habitat is said to be the world’s first butterfly garden in an airport. The two-story garden, which also contains a six-meter (20-foot) waterfall, is dedicated to showcasing a myriad of bright tropical plants and more than 1,000 butterflies over the course of a year. As many as 40 species call this sanctuary home, including the Blue Clipper butterfly (Parthenos sylvia), and Singapore’s national butterfly, the Common Rose butterfly (Pachliopta aristolochiae). While visitors are free to roam and marvel at the sight of butterflies unconcernedly flitting from flowers to the pineapple slices strategically positioned all around the garden, there are also educational signs and enclosures that allow visitors to see the life cycle of the butterfly up close, from caterpillar to winged creature.

With five permanent exhibits and a variety of traveling and themed temporary galleries, the Museum boasts files of every Republic of Singapore stamp issued, all available for the perusal of visitors. Their mission is to help promote the use of philately (the collection and study of stamps) for educational purposes, as stamp design is often a great historical indicator of how the public, government, and culture as a whole related to internal and external events of the given time period. The Museum was opened on August 19, 1995, housed in a building that was once part of the Anglo Chinese school dating back to 1906. Designed by Tomlinson and Lermit Architects, the building was commissioned by the Trustees of the Anglo Chinese School as an addition to the 1897 Oldam Hall. It was then used as a Methodist Book Room from 1970 until its restoration as the Singapore Philatelic Museum in 1995. The Museum is currently a fully owned subsidiary of the National Heritage Board. Not just for stamp buffs, the Museum offers a view into the traditions and cultures of a multi-ethnic Singapore as captured on stamps throughout the decades, as well as demonstrates the process of stamp production through guest-interactive activities and exhibits. The main collection is the Straits Settlements Collection, displaying stamps and other postal archival material as early as 1854. Other exhibits include the importance of stamp collecting, the secrets behind folded letters and stamp designs, 18th century philatelic rarities, and a Heritage Room providing insight into lifestyles past.",postal purveyors of curiosities collections museums
32,Yongma Land Abandoned Theme Park,"Seoul, South Korea",Plenty of old carney magic still haunts this photogenic amusement park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yongma-land-abandoned-themepark,"There is a small abandoned theme park in Seoul, South Korea, with a quieted carousel, bleached-out images of ’80s pop icons, and “dodgem” cars that have long-since quit dodging. But unlike most amusement parks that have gone idle, this one invites the public to share in its slow crumble. Yongma Land was built in 1980, and had a fairly solid run as a small family-oriented amusement park. By 2011 tastes had moved on, and with attendance dwindling it closed down. Despite stories of a haunting or two, the root of its demise was likely just a matter of profit, when the construction of several, much larger and better located, theme parks lured the thrill-seekers away. Now in the hands of an enterprising local businessman, the old Yongma Land is open again, but this time to revel in the poignant charm of its decay. For a small charge of 10,000 won per adult (about $9, a bit more for professionals) and 5,000 won per child, visitors are free to roam the old rides, no fence-jumping needed. And for 30,000 won, the owner will turn on the lights of the ghostly merry-go-round for you after 8:00 pm. The fading colors and jumbled figures have proven attractive for musicians and other artists too, inspiring several K-pop videos (most notably Crayon Pop’s “Bar Bar Bar” video) and other photo shoots. With piles of dodgem (or bumper) cars, a rusting octopus ride, a Viking ship, and a displaced clown-motif roller coaster, there is still plenty of carney magic to inspire even amateur photographers.  Mangu Station is the closest train station to Yongma Land. From there, you can take a bus most of the way or walk. Head for the gate and pass through the first one to a second gate, where there is a ticket booth. If the owner is in the office he’ll take your entry fee. And if not, there is a phone number you can call. Just mention 'Yongma Land'. Although none of the rides work anymore, the owner does keep the toilet facilities maintained, and you can purchase some vending machine items (and balloons for photos) on-site. But be careful—the site is run down and things are rickety.

The Trick Eye Museum in Seoul celebrates this art form with a collection of interactive optical illusions ranging from the unbearably silly to the classically whimsical. While the high-minded tradition of trompe l’oeil is certainly on display in the museum it is all in service to providing opportunities for goofy photo opportunities. Containing hundreds of oversized paintings for visitors to jump into, the museum allows guests to orient themselves in perspective with the images so that it can seem as though they are being crushed by a hydra, hanging off of a cliff, or taking part in Botticelli’s Birth of Venus. Some of the images are whole rooms that seem to have been turned on their head or their side allowing the subject to look like they are climbing the walls or standing on the ceiling. The giant paintings of sushi pieces reaching out from the frame and images of angel wings just waiting to be stepped into might come off as garish if they weren’t mixed together with works that ape a classical renaissance style, some replica of actual artworks that guests can make themselves a part of. The Trick Eye Museum continues to add optical illusions to its collection which now covers almost every wall in the space. In addition, the museum has also opened an “Ice Museum” next door that while retaining the Trick Eye name has nothing to do with tromp l’oeil images and is solely focused on ice sculptures and plastic displays of frozen water. The connection seems a bit strained, but both sites provide ample photo opportunities.",optical illusions museums and collections art museums
34,Cafe Yeonnam-Dong 223-14,"Seoul, South Korea",Step into a cartoon at this Seoul café that aims to evoke a two-dimensional scene.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cafe-yeonnam-dong-2-dimensional-cafe,"Warning to those with vertigo: This may not be the cafe for you. That’s not because it’s located on a cliff. Instead, Seoul’s Cafe Yeonnam-Dong 223-14, named after its street number and affectionately known as the “Drawing Cafe,” may dizzy you with the uncanny feeling that you just entered a cartoon. Done up in white, with pencil-like black pigment outlining everything from the chairs and tables to the flattened “shirts” on the laundry line outside, the small cafe gives visitors the distinct impression of being pressed into a comic strip. The pastel pastries and frothed milk topping the “flat” cups add a pop of color to this stark, pencil-and-paper landscape. The cafe’s owner and sole proprietor, J.S. Lee, was inspired by pop culture—specifically, a Korean cartoon and Instagram. The show in question is W, a web cartoon fantasy about a man caught between real life and, you guessed it, a web cartoon. While that show lasted only 16 episodes, Lee’s cafe, though still young, seems to have staying power. That’s partly due to his other online muse: The cafe was designed to be as Instagrammable as possible. Locals and travelers alike line up to visit the small space, located in Seoul’s Yeonnam-dong neighborhood, to snap a pic or 10 and to dine on deceptively 2-D coffees, pastries, and rich smoothies adorned in chocolate coins. Visitors are warned to take care, however, lest they walk through the cartoon door and find themselves stuck starring in their own multidimensional web series.  The cafe is open daily from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., though visitors should be warned: The line to enter is often quite lengthy with crowds clamoring for their photo op.",instagram comic books cartoons coffee
35,Imsil Cheese Theme Park,"Imsil-gun, South Korea",A 32-acre fun park dedicated to all things cheese.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/imsil-cheese-theme-park,"Up until a few decades ago, many people in Korea had never heard of cheese, let alone tasted it or made it. Now a 32-acre cheese-themed fun park in the small county of Imsil is an expression of the country’s love affair with the food. The introduction of cheese to the Korean diet is traced back to 1958, when a Belgian priest came to Imsil in the Jeollabuk-do region as a missionary, where he raised goats and started to make his own cheese. The governor of Imsil asked him to teach the skill to the whole community. And so Imsil became the mecca of cheese in Korea. The Imsil Cheese Theme Park, opened in 2004, is a cheese heaven where you can learn about, make, and eat the delightful dairy, ride down the slide past the goats to the Cheese Playland, and stroll the walkways checking out the cheese-wheel buildings and various cartoon statues that dot the park. The park has a few “cheese experience” centers where you can make cheese, a milk processing factory, a local specialty shop, two restaurants, and a science lab that researches different methods for making the best cheese.  The Cheese Theme Park is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., closed on major holidays.",cheese amusement parks parks food

The delicate collection is divided into indoor and outdoor sections, each with their own variety of delicate glasswork. The exterior garden features such amazingly naturalistic installations as a glass waterfall, glass flowerbeds, and lake made of mirrors with fish constructed out of used soju (a popular Korean alcohol) bottles. The indoor sights include a towering green glass beanstalk in the center of the exhibition hall, a room full of mirrors where visitors can get lost in their infinite reflections, and even a glass bookshelf with glass books. The bright crystalline colors of the over 200 pieces at the castle are mainly not to be touched lest the entire site comes crashing down from an errant poke, but there are a number interactive bits such as the glass drums which attendees can bang on if they dare. For an extra fee, visitors can even experience making their own glass creations. The Jeju Glass Castle Theme Park bills itself as an attraction for the whole family.

The media likes to repeat legends of mysterious deaths, mad doctors that were as crazy as the patients in the asylum, and other “fakelore” to hype the creepy factor of the place, but the hospital was closed in the 1990s and abandoned for more mundane reasons than their tall tales would have you believe. Gonjiam was forced to close mainly due to economic downturns, unsanitary conditions, and problems with the sewage disposal system, not due to insane doctors or murderous patients. As the sewage problem grew, the owner left the country and did not leave documentation behind about the land or the buildings on it. Eventually, the hospital just closed its doors and it has been abandoned ever since, unless you count the numerous tourists, camera crews, and ghost hunters who come to stroll through the area, looking for evidence of paranormal activity or the proverbial skeletons in the closets of the asylum. The hospital is technically closed to the public and locals do not encourage tourists or give directions to the asylum willingly but roughly a thousand people break in and roam the grounds of Gonjiam Psychiatric hospital every year. The buildings stand complete with rusted out machines, hospital remnants, trash, and filthy mattresses, adding to its creepy and haunted reputation. In 2018, they released a horror film called “Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum” about the Gonjiam Psychiatric Hospital. Update: This was demolished in May 2018.",abandoned hospitals abandoned insane asylums haunted medicine
38,Third Tunnel of Aggression,"Paju, South Korea",Secret North Korean passage discovered below the world's most dangerous border.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/third-tunnel-of-aggression,"For the most part, every inch of the world can be explored. If you can fly, drive or walk to it, it’s fair game. The Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea represents one of the few stretches of land that is off limits, or at least the surface of it is. There are tunnels, it turns out, underground that can be visited. Called the Third Tunnel of Aggression, it was built by North Korea in the 1970s and discovered in 1978 by South Korea. It was the third tunnel found by the South—a total of four have been discovered—and it is rumored there may be more than a dozen more undiscovered North Korean passages. At the time of its discovery, the United Nations estimated the North could move 30,000 men per hour through the tunnel to the Southern side. After initially denying its existence, the North claimed that the Third Tunnel was a coal mine, going as far as to rub black coal dust on the walls. That tactic obviously failed and the South took control of the tunnel, blocking off the actual demarcation line with concrete barriers. Nowadays, the passage snakes beneath the divided nations for over a mile and, at its outset, looks like a space-age tunnel from a science fiction movie. Although the tunnel is available for visitors on tours and even begins with a gift shop, deeper down the two-by-two-meter tunnel are stark reminders of the danger the tunnel represents. As you walk along the path, the light dims and visitors are left only with moist, craggy walls and the faint flickering lights installed along the way. You can walk a full 265 meters until hitting the divider installed to protect the South from attacks by the North.  Pictures are not allowed inside of the tunnel, making a journey down the burrow a haunting and visceral experience. Pre-approved tours can be arranged online, and most tours of the DMZ from Panmunjom include the Third Tunnel of Aggression. You'll be shown a South Korean-produced video detailing that nation's version of events surrounding the tunnel's discovery before you'll be allowed to enter the tunnel.",tunnels subterranean sites architectural oddities architecture

But you’d be well advised to trek down to Coffee Hanyakbang in the Euljiro area of Seoul. Never mind that it’s not visible from the street. The cafe’s interior sports a blend of Chinese and Korean designs, and a variety of Chinese antiques imported by the owners are on display. But the overall feeling inside is rustic, with a menu made from an old plank of wood and a gaping hole in the concrete ceiling revealing the pipes above the establishment. Hanyakbang has become well-known among coffee connoisseurs, serving delicious single-origin, hand-drip coffee at decent prices. The beans are roasted by hand in the back corner of the café and are ground on site, producing a fresh aroma that washes over you like a wave as you enter. The baristas, all dressed neatly in white, treat their work like a science, homing in on every pour to bring you the optimal cup. It’s the definition of a hidden gem in a city full of them, a quiet delight just far enough away from the hustle and bustle.  Take the subway to Euljiro 3-ga Station, and leave through Exit 1.

The exhibition halls that house the gift shop and gallery of the park are modeled after traditional Korean architecture, but very little else is of a “traditional” nature in this park. Bulkkeuni (a phallus wearing yellow mittens) and Saekkeuni (a vagina modeling a floppy hat and bow), the park’s mascots, welcome visitors through the front gates. The restrooms adhere to the sexual theme as well: two breasts for handles on the men’s door, and an erect penis as a doorknob for the women’s door. The outdoor theme park features 140 sculptures representing humans in various sexual positions. After the Korean War, the island became a popular honeymoon destination for Korean couples, due to the island’s warm climate. Many of the couples had wed because of arranged marriages, and the island also became known for being a center of sex education. Visitors are required to be at least 18 years old, and a separate play area is available for minors while adults visit.

To enter its lower hall, you must first step through the mouth of a dragon. The dragon’s body twists roughly 330 feet through trees and bushes. Why a giant dragon? The reptilian beasts represent good fortune, spiritual clarity, and in Buddhism, they are the protectors of the Buddha and the temples. This temple—aptly nicknamed the “Dragon Temple”—built a giant dragon to ensure ultimate fortune, clarity, and protection. In addition to offering protection, the coiled monster acts like a long, winding hallway. It’s filled with religious statues and artwork that tell the story of the Buddha, so your journey through the bowels of the beast is actually an educational experience. While making your way through the dragon’s body, you’ll pass a meditation area, Buddhist artwork, and dozens of little golden Buddha statues. A door within the dragon leads to the lower level of the temple. Apart from the colorful dragon, the main temple is stunning: the backdrop of the mountains, the peaceful quiet, and the two dragon heads that guard the temple make it a beautiful, unique temple experience. Surprisingly, this temple isn’t very popular with tourists, so it’s a great place to peacefully explore. From Pohang Bus Terminal, take bus #510 for 34 stops, about 50 minutes, and get off at the Chilpo 1-ri stop. Walk about 10 minutes down a dirt road to Daewonsa Temple.",dragons buddhism temples
42,Oedo Botania,"Geoje-si, South Korea",One man and his wife have turned a barren Korean island into a fantastical botanical wonderland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oedo-botania,"A number of small islands surround the southern coast of South Korea, but few compare to the unique natural beauty of Oedo Botanica, a former bit of barren rock that has been wholly transformed into a diverse botanical garden. In 1969, a man named Lee Chang-ho took shelter from a squall in the lee of Oedo, a tiny heap of rocks sticking out of the green waters of Hallyeohaesang National Park off the southeast coast of South Korea. Lee saw potential in the rocky little spot, and in that same year, moved he and his wife, Choi Ho Suk, to the island. At first they tried to harvest tangerines and raise pigs, but neither crop took to the land, so they began thinking about simply transforming the whole island into a botanical garden. After getting approval in 1976, Lee and his wife started growing what would eventually become a stunning botanical garden coating the entire surface of the island. After almost 30 years of growth and development, the little island now sports, trees, flowers, shrubs, and even cactus, and rare species of agave cascading down the island’s gentle slopes. The carefully manicured paths and precisely sculpted topiaries add a fantasy element to the setting, making it all seem a bit unreal. All of this, grown under the couples’ loving care. The island has been completely transformed into a little slice of paradise, its flower-covered hillsides and perfumed air are popular with Korean vacationers and tourists from around the world—those fortunate enough to learn about the island from locals at least. The Oedo Botanica is accessible by ferry from the nearby port of Gujora, and continues to be hailed for its picturesque statuary, hiking paths, scenic vistas of nearby Geoje Island, and thousands upon thousands of species of lush plant varieties. Not a bad place to take port in a storm. Oedo lies adjacent to the larger and much more populous island of Geoje, and is only accessible by ferry. From Geoje's main cities of Okpo or Gohyeon, take a bus bound for the smaller town of Jangseungpo on Geoje's east coast. From there it's an easy walk to the Oedo ferry terminal at the port of Gujora, and a 20-minute voyage to Oedo's dock.",topiary botanical gardens gardens islands plants
43,Museum Kimchikan,"Seoul, South Korea","Tracking the 1,500-year history of Korea's star cabbage.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-kimchikan,"In 1988, when the top international athletes were competing for medals at the Seoul Olympics in South Korea, a new star was introduced to the world, one that had nothing to do with sport. It was the first time kimchi, a spicy fermented cabbage dish, was experienced by such a wide variety of people. This marked the start of kimchi’s global journey. Now the dish, which is a traditional staple of both North and South Korea, can be seen on menus around the world. During the 1988 Olympics, visitors who tasted the dish and wanted to know more visited the Kimchi Museum, which opened in 1986 and had been moved to the Korea World Trade Center Complex for the event. This institution was later revamped and opened its doors as the Museum Kimchikan in 2015. Now, the museum showcases the 1,500-year-history of kimchi, the production of which is traditionally a community affair. Every fall, families gather to blend the chopped vegetables with spices and stock up for the winter ahead. The process is known as kimjang and this collaborative tradition was recognized in 2013 by UNESCO as a piece of intangible cultural heritage. The most well-known version consists of Napa cabbage, scallions, and chili and garlic powders. A wide variety of vegetables and seafood is used in the nearly 180 regional forms of the dish. At the Museum Kimchikan, visitors can view the production technique, which uses lactobacillus bacteria, under a microscope. They can also watch documentaries about the history of kimjang, and how the country’s most prominent families made kimchi. Most importantly, visitors are invited to sample the different varieties.  To participate in demonstrations and cooking classes, you must make a reservation at least four days prior. Check the website for more details.    The museum features a tasting room, cafe, laboratory, arts space, and a souvenir shop.  Entrance fee for adults: 5000 won, children: 3000 won. A free audioguide is available in English, Chinese, or Japanese. Museum Kimchikan is located on the 4th, 5th, and 6th floors of the Insa-dong Maru building.

The decor inside the cafe is equally ecstatic about photography with film negatives sitting on each coffee table, and even toilet paper that is made to look like a film reel. While the first floor of the cafe is devoted to a sort of camera museum, the second floor is home to a small gallery of photography, which patrons are welcome to try and submit their own work to. Or they can simply enjoy the rather amazing, uninterrupted view of the Korean mountains.

The collection ranges from hanging arrangements to three-meter-tall trunks of wood, sculpted by Korean artists to showcase anything from joy, spirituality, to sexuality. The small Folk Museum attached showcases phallic-related art throughout the ages, as well as the history of the small fishing community. Haeshindang Park is tragic in origin. A young couple, madly in love and soon to be wed, was split by tragedy when the high tide overtook the woman in view of her fiancé on the shore. The next day, the number of fish caught dwindled. The following day, they dried up. The townspeople were said to be cursed and wondered what to do, that is, until a local fisherman relieved himself in the sea. The fish returned and men of the town took note. Thus, statues were constructed and placed in view of the shore.  From Samcheok: Take bus 24 to Sinnam (pronounced :Shinnom ).

Behind the nondescript wall, a guard tower looms, and below it, a grim gate. This gate marks the entrance to Seodaemun Prison, a relic from a forgotten era in Korea’s past steeped in subjugation and humiliation. Seodaemun Prison was opened in 1908 by occupying Japanese forces in an attempt to impose order on the newly acquired territory. Prior, the country had a virtually non-existent penal system, and the introduction of Seodaemun Prison was a precursor to full out occupation. Seodaemun became a bastion for the Korean independence movement from its opening in 1908 until the liberation of the country in 1945. As the Japanese arrested more patriots, the prison’s notoriety increased and it eventually became a symbol of perseverance. Many patriots died in custody, were tortured to death, or were executed within the prison’s walls. The macabre execution hall still stands, housing the prison’s gallows (with a tunnel nearby to dispose of corpses). Throughout the preserved prison-turned-museum, you can see chillingly recreated torture chambers, jail cells, isolation cells, and more. The women’s section has been preserved, basement cells in which no privacy was afforded. Some of the torture chambers have frighteningly realistic mannequins and effigies to famous Korean patriots who died within the prison. Designated as a historic site in 1988 and renovated in 1995, Seodaemun is an interesting place to visit for those who want a tactile experience of the Japanese occupation and the horrors entailed. It stands out amongst Seoul’s other historic sites as a monument to those who helped shape the modern Korean nation.",catacombs prisons crime and punishment catacombs and crypts military history world war ii military
47,Japanese Ruins of Busan,"Busan, South Korea",The 400-year-old remains of the samurai invasion of Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/japanese-castle-ruins-of-busan,"In the late 16th century, Japanese Samurai lords, daimyos, built several castle-like fortresses in Busan during an ambitious plan to conquer Joseon Korea and Ming China. The Koreans, with the later help of the Ming emperor, used guerrilla tactics and flame-throwing armored turtle ships to expel the Japanese from the peninsula. The fortresses, however, remained. Several of the 400-year-old castle ruins can be still be seen around the southeast of Korea. They are mostly ivy and root-tangled walls and grassy baileys, situated in peaceful green parks. These ruins were once the site of some of bloody battles between the Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese forces. The Japanese invasion of Korea, or Imjin War, began in the spring of 1592 when samurai warriors and several thousand soldiers landed on Korean shores and laid siege to the city of Busan. Samurai scaled the walls of the Busanjin garrison under the cover of arquebus fire and overran the Korean defenses. After the Korean defeat, the Japanese, led by daimyo Toyotomi Hideyoshi, erected a network of Japanese-style fortresses in Korea to prepare for an assault on China. But Japan would not make it all the way to Beijing. Korean national hero admiral Yi Sun Sin harassed and weakened the Japanese resupply line with turtle ships, armored battleships with dragon-head bows that could shoot fire and cannon balls. On land, the Korean righteous army fought guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. The Ming emperor Wanli sent an army to stop the invaders as they reached and conquered Pyongyang, the modern-day capital of North Korea. The Japanese finally retreated back to Japan in 1598. History would repeat itself in 1910 when Japan invaded Korea and later Chinese Manchuria, unleashing events that would split the Korean peninsula in two and affect the whole world today.

Most of the owls are hand-crafted – there are owl paintings, pots, clocks, toys, screens, dishes… name an object that could have an owl on it, and Bae’s got it.

This small village in the eastern reaches of Jeollanam-do, near Suncheon bay, is considered the best preserved example of a Korean fortress town. According to records kept during the Joseon dynasty there were over 330 of these fortress towns around the Korean peninsula. During the Japanese occupation, many of them were destroyed or dismantled. However, Naganeupseong, along with its inhabitants, remains nearly untouched, the town becoming a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2011. The site of the village has actually been inhabited since the beginning of the first millennia, the area was selected as a fortress village in the early 10th century by the Goryeo Dynasty but began to truly flourish in the late 1300s under the Joseons. 231 of the houses in Naganeupseong are still in their original condition, with thatched roofs, mortar free stone work, no plumbing, and living spaces that would be considered a little cramped by today’s Western standards. Among the people going about their ancient versions of daily lives are a smattering tourists brave enough to make the drive or take the municipal bus. Around the town are numerous and haphazard dioramas of historical Korean life in the town; including hands on traditional games of skill and papier-mâché-like models of corporal punishment and administrative proceedings. The odd dichotomy of buying a cold bottle of water from a gift shop and then peering into someone’s living “room” is a little unsettling. Other sites in the village include a large lotus pond, fortress walls and some well preserved original houses with no one living in them that allow visitors to step inside. Beyond simply wandering around as a voyeur the village does offer many activities to participate in at special times throughout the day and year. Traditional art, weaving, dyeing and music experiences are all available. There are also regular performances of traditional music and dancing. There is even a lesson in traditional Korean tea ceremony etiquette or riding in a dalguji. The Naganeupseong Folk Village is a great excuse to stare at people or admire the Confucian ideology of harmony with nature present in the arrangement of the village and the architecture therein.

50,108 Heaven Stairway,"Seoul, South Korea",A remnant of Korea's colonial past lies forgotten in a hip neighborhood in Seoul.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/108-heaven-stairway,"The 108 Heaven Stairway in Haebangchon, Seoul, is the last physical trace of Japanese colonialism in the area beneath the towering Namsan. The stairway was constructed in 1943 by Japanese authorities to pave a way to the Gyeongseong Hoguk Shrine, a Shinto shrine built to house “Japan’s war dead.” During Japanese occupation, Koreans who lived in the area were forced make the journey up the stairs to attend daily Shinto prayers. Even schoolchildren in Haebangchon were made to attend these daily rituals, in an effort to inject elements of Japanese culture into the Korean youth. Upon the expulsion of the Japanese in 1945, the shrine was torn down at the hands of the local Korean community, but the stairway was left untouched. Today, the stairs are tucked away in the neighborhood of Haebangchon, an area that until recently was considered to be derelict. Over the last few years, however, Korean millennials have begun transforming the area into a collection of hipster cafes, bars, and galleries, intermingled with crumbling residential blocks. As shoemakers are replaced by La Marzoccos, the 108 Stairway persists, hinting at the influence of Japan in moulding a complex Korean identity, at once divorced and eternally entangled with its colonial past. The 108 Stairway is a fascinating piece of colonial history that most Seoulites today walk up without realizing the significance of what lies beneath their feet. The greenery around the stairs is overgrown, the location nondescript, and the legacy known to few. It takes a little searching to find it, but it’s worth the adventure to find this important piece of Korean history that is at risk of being completely forgotten.

The second edition of the work, which still exists today was commissioned between 1236 and 1251, again in an effort to curb an invasion of hostile forces. Once completed, this second collection of Buddhist doctrine, law, and philosophy covered 81,258 wooden print blocks, containing 52,382,960 flawless characters. The mind-boggling work was moved to a temple known as Haeinsa in 1398 and has been housed across four separate buildings ever since, weathering centuries of time. Today the ancient birch wood tablets have all been treated to prevent any further decay and are still located in the same temple housing they have been for centuries. The building was specifically designed to keep optimum ventilation, temperature, and humidity levels, and even after hundreds of years, it’s done better than modern technology. In 1970, the blocks developed mildew after being moved to a newly built storage facility, and were promptly returned here for their long-term preservation. The collection is not only listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site but is also the 32nd National Treasure of Korea. Start from Dongdaegu or Daegu train station, and make your way to Seongdangmot subway station (line 1 towards Daegok, exit 3) and head to the Seobu City Bus Terminal. Buses for Haeinsa leave every 40 minutes, make several stops along the way and take about 1 1/2 hours to arrive.

52,Jinkwansa Temple,"Jingwan-gil, South Korea",An all-female order shares an ancient culinary art with visitors at their mountaintop monastery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/korean-temple-cuisine,"Jinkwansa, a 12th-century Buddhist temple, sits atop a mountain in Seoul’s Bukhansan National Park. Women with shaved heads and gray robes run the entire operation. These nuns are renowned for their cuisine, which epitomizes the ancient art of Korean temple fare. It’s vegan and free of MSG, garlic, onion, and leeks. Buddhist teaching advises eschewing these ingredients, as they are believed to incite lust, among other things. Food prepared at the temple, on the other hand, is meant to further meditation. And though many monasteries follow the same principles, high-profile visitors from around the world visit Jinkwansa specifically in search of culinary wisdom. Though monastic cuisine has a deserved association with asceticism, Korean temple cuisine is far from bland. Nuns ferment, spice, dry, marinate, and pickle ingredients to create all sorts of pungent, spicy, and tangy dishes. They also ferment up to 30 different soybean pastes at a time, some of which have been aging beneath the sun for 50 years. Visitors have mentioned tasting more than 25 dishes in one meal, sampling fermented radishes, chestnut stew, crispy greens, marinated tofu, mushroom fritters, and sweet sticky rice squares sprinkled with fruit and nuts. The lattermost treat serves as the nuns’ energy-replenishing staple on head-shaving day. The female order has maintained its status as the preeminent location for temple cuisine for centuries. In Korean Buddhism, monastic mealtime is a practice referred to as Baru Gongyang, or “offering.” Diners eat in silence from a wooden bowl, using wooden chopsticks. Historically, Jinkwansa hosted suryukje, an annual ritual in which the dead are led to heaven through chanting and food ceremonies, and lauded monks stayed on-site. Thus, the nuns honed their cooking skills and reputation feeding large groups. Today, anyone can reserve a stay at Jinkwansa, take cooking classes, and tour the property. And despite the establishment’s increased popularity, nuns continue to cook with vegetables grown on temple grounds.",ritual cloistered comestibles vegetables fermented food buddhism rites and rituals
53,Samtan Art Mine,"Jeongseon, South Korea",This former coal mine has been turned into a sprawling modern art complex.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/samtan-art-mine,"Instead of just being left to rust away, Korea’s abandoned Samcheok Mine has been converted into an impressive contemporary art complex that highlights both fresh voices in modern art and the area’s rich history of mining. Opened in 1962, the Samcheok Mine was a huge operation employing around 3,000 people from the nearby area. As the demand for coal waned, thus did the fortunes of the huge plant, and it closed its doors in 2001. While many mines the world over have been left to rot after being shut down, becoming playgrounds for urban explorers and graffiti artists, there were grander plans for the once-thriving mine. In an effort to bring tourist dollars to the area as compensation for the income lost now that the plant was no longer in operation, the Samtan Art Mine was born. Each of the buildings, whether industrial or office, was refurbished and turned into a dynamic new space for modern art. The old shafts were cleaned up and lit to accentuate their natural beauty, and many of the coal-stained workers’ areas were converted into memorials to those who lost their lives both figuratively and literally while working on the site. Today the site is a vibrant locus of contemporary art that has not forgotten its industrial past.

54,Hwaam Cave,"Jeongseon, South Korea",Asia's largest limestone cave is home to a world of plastic goblins and gold mining history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hwaam-cave,"Located in the isolated county of Jeongseon, hours outside of Seoul, Hyaam Cave is a one of a kind mining museum and caving experience that isn’t afraid to install a bunch of cartoonish goblins to keep things interesting. Formerly known as the Cheon Po gold mine, Hwaan Cave is the largest limestone cave in Asia, and was once the fifth most productive gold mine in Korea. The mines and connected cave system are now open to the public as a mining museum and tourist attraction. Visitors enter at the top of the mine via a monorail trip (or rather laborious hike), and then descend down through the caves, passing through a number of distinctly presented sections of history and spectacle. During the first section of the tour, guests get a sober tour through the history of the mine’s techniques. Mining mannequins are staged in working positions and there are pneumatic drills that have been set up to let people “get a piece of cave.” This section also has actual gold veins that were left in the rock walls which can be viewed through magnifying glasses. Continuing down a seemingly endless, dizzying stairway that is lit with bright colored lights, things get surreal fairly quickly as one enters the “Golden Fantasy.” This section of the mine has been set up with a number of tableaus where cartoony goblin figures toil away and the history and importance of gold is told by the whimsical creatures. After leaving the fantasy creatures behind, guests are ushered into a land of pure gold (paint that is). displays and educational videos show golden bounties that look like something out of a fairy tale. Gold bars, coins, and other artifacts are presented in a spectacle of opulence. Before leaving the underworld phantasmagoria, the final attraction is the massive final cave which features some of the most spectacular stalactites and stalagmites in the country. The cave is presented as a natural cathedral with statues of the Virgin Mary, Buddha, and other religious iconography. Considering how out of the way Hyaam Cave is, it is no wonder that they feel the need to embellish their already interesting mining history with bright lights, animated characters, religion, and anything else that might draw visitors across the great distance.",mines caves ecosystems
55,Noryangjin Fish Market,"Seoul, South Korea","Buy your fish and have it cooked to order in this bustling, eight-floor seafood market.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/noryangjin-fish-market,"Tentacles trail off tables. Vendors shovel shellfish into buyers’ bags. Gleaming fish swim in aquariums. At the Noryangjin seafood market in Seoul, the fish is as fresh as it gets. The lower floors of this massive market, which supplies around 50 percent of Seoul’s seafood, is dominated by every imaginable fruit of the sea, from giant crabs to salmon steaks to the suggestively shaped penis fish. On the upper floors, rows of restaurants cook shoppers’ purchases to their specifications or prepare a classic dish of hwe or hoe, raw uncured seafood cut fresh and enjoyed with sauces and salads. Open 24-7, the market particularly comes alive late at night when, from around 1:00 a.m. until dawn, the space buzzes with seafood auctions. On weekend evenings, meanwhile, the building bustles with locals doing their shopping and socializing over bitter soju and fresh, salty hoe. No matter what the time, wandering through Noryangjin can take hours. There are two buildings at the site: an older, open-air structure, which housed the original market, and a shiny, recently-updated building, complete with escalators, a whopping eight floors of stalls, and hundreds of vendors calling out to visitors to sample their wares. The move was controversial; some vendors refused to shift from the old building to the mall-like new structure, and you can see protest graffiti on the older warehouse. Most vendors, however, have made the move. The new building now includes some favorite spots, such as a knife shop in Section D, offering sharp tools for aspiring sashimi chefs, and a fermented seafood market, featuring salty, pungent cured fish. Noryangjin offers another, slightly more controversial delicacy: sannakji. This octopus is even fresher than other kinds of hoe, as it’s not only raw—it’s moving. To prepare the dish, chefs chop the tentacles of a live octopus, and while the resulting morsels are technically dead, nerve reactions in the tentacles keeps them squirming even as they’re eaten. There’s been some debate on the ethics of this dish, but it is undoubtedly a popular local specialty, and if you’re going to try it, Noryangjin is the best place to do so. Experienced sannakji eaters offer one tip: The tentacles’ suckers have been known to stick on the way down, so chew thoroughly.  Visitors can easily access the market from Noryangjin Station, but be aware: There are actually two different, unconnected Noryangjin stations from two different metro lines, so be sure to specify which one if you're meeting friends. Inside, the dizzying array of vendors and restaurant options may overwhelm you, but chances are the stall you buy seafood from will have its own connection to a restaurant. Follow where the vendor leads you and fishy goodness is yours.",seafood markets street food
56,Vantablack Hyundai Pavilion,"Pyeongchang, South Korea",The darkest building on Earth was built for the snow-white scenery of the 2018 Winter Olympics.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vantablack-hyundai-pavilion,"The Hyundai Pavilion stands like a “schism in space,” designed for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea. Covered in Vantablack, a material that absorbs 99.965% of light, it was like a black hole in the whiteness of the winter scenery. The curved walls of the Hyundai Pavilion stand 33 feet high and 115 feet long. But they look completely flat despite the curvature, thanks to a covering of Vantablack VBx 2, a spray-paint version of the original Vantablack created by Surrey NanoSystems in the U.K. Made using vertically aligned nanotube arrays (hence the acronym “Vanta”), Vantablack is one of the darkest artificial substances in the world. Ben Jensen, the co-founder of Surrey NanoSystems, explained the basics to CNN: “Carbon nanotubes are like very, very long blades of grass. Now you imagine if you were a human walking around in grass 1,000 feet tall how little light would get down to you. It’s like that but on a very tiny scale.” Vantablack was originally developed for satellite-borne blackbody calibration systems, but its unique properties have attracted widespread interest from various fields, including the arts. In February 2018, Asif Khan and his London-based architecture firm unveiled the Vantablack-coated Hyundai Pavilion in Pyeongchang. Studded with thousands of pinprick points of light, the otherwise blackest-of-black exterior is like a vision into the depths of outer space. The stars are on rods, all set at different depths, creating a three dimensional vision of space in which the “universe” seems to move as you walk past. Inside, meanwhile, the pavilion is completely different. The interior is a stark, bright white throughout, with a water installation with drops of water running through channels carved into the floor. The droplets represent the hydrogen that formed at the beginning of the universe, the same as contained within the stars represented in the building’s exterior. On a more prosaic and commercial level, the whole thing is a reference to Hyundai’s latest venture into the world of fuel cell-powered vehicles. Update: Though the pavilion was relocated to the Songwon Art Center, it is no longer there. However, the current exhibit there is fascinating even if it is trying to get you to know more about Hyundai and their solar cell. The area around Songwon is also worthy of a visit with various art galleries.",olympics color technology architectural oddities architecture

Located close to the concrete hive that is Seoul, and even closer to Korea’s DMZ, (just 6 kilometers away) the artist’s collective promotes an attitude of openness where hiding your work behind hedges and fences is not allowed. This ethos of constant creation and collaboration exists throughout every aspect of the colony down to the street lights which are dim and sparse, reasoning, “How else can you enjoy the stars?” Among the many buildings in the community there are over 50 galleries, museums, cafes and restaurants supporting over 500 artists including sculptors, actors, painters, writers, and photographers. As would be expected from a town built by and for artists, each structure is built in a unique and striking architectural style, from the building meant to look like chocolate to the environmentally forward structure with tree branches growing right through the walls. Heyri Valley was envisioned and established by Korean book publisher Kim Eun-ho in 2001, bringing an almost utopian vision of an artist’s community to vibrant, thriving life. It is estimated that there will be 500 buildings in the valley by 2015, creating a dreamlike vanguard of art, peace, and togetherness just a stone’s throw from one of the most contested borders in the world.

The huge amount of water that comes out of the fountain falls down into the river underneath at a distance up to 141 feet (43 meters) horizontally and 66 feet (20 meters) vertically. The water ejected is continuously recycled by being pumped again into the fountain, making sure that the installation is eco-friendly. Also, the jets can move to the beat of the music.

Straddling the line is Buddhist hermit Yi Gap Yong. Yong created 120 stone pagodas below the Horse Ear Mountains in South Korea. And he did so without any tools, mortar or help from his friends. Yong came to the area to meditate in 1885 when he was only 25 years old. When he first arrived, it was a tranquil landscape, but was not yet a temple, and he was not yet an ordained monk. Lack of formal training did little to slow down his work, and over the next 30 years he built the pagodas while living alone as a hermit. Created out of circles of larger rocks, the pagodas eventually come to a point, giving them their conical peak. All made solely of local rocks from streams and rivers, some of the largest pagodas tower 30 feet above the rest of the temple complex. Yong died in 1957 nearly 100 years old. Today, over 80 of the pagodas remain and have been preserved for tourists.

61,Jeju Mermaids,"Seogwipo, South Korea",South Korea's women of the sea have completely flipped their society's structure by becoming revered fisherwomen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jeju-mermaids,"Despite the historically patriarchal society in South Korea, some of the small fishing islands off the south coast have flipped the script thanks to the “Haenyeo.” Otherwise known as the Jeju Mermaids, these pioneering (and largely elderly) fisherwomen have become the head of their family units. Focused around the island of Jeju but with an influence that has spread to some of the smaller surrounding islands, the trend that has seen women in the regions take the place of the men as providers is believed to have begun as a way of getting around taxes. At one point, males would be highly taxed even on their meager fishing hauls, but in a loophole that speaks volume to women’s place in society at the time, females were not taxed at all. This being the case families began having women do the fishing, hauling in catches of shellfish, octopus, seaweed, and abalone. As the trend continued, islands such as Jeju saw their family units flip power structures almost completely as they free dove for sea life in the icy East China Sea. The tradition has survived for hundreds of years, but now the Haenyeo are in danger of disappearing as more and more of their daughters are choosing life in bigger mainland cities. Today the major population of the so-called Jeju Mermaids are elderly women over the age of 50 who still go out and dive as deep as 60 feet (without a breathing apparatus) to collect their family’s main source of income. There is a Haenyeo museum in Jeju-si, and a number of statues and art pieces on the island devoted to the mermaid matriarchs, so with luck, even as their numbers dwindle, the memory of their powerful contributions will not.  The cove of which the mermaids call home-base, is right next to the Volcanic crater of Seongsan Ilchulbong. Depending on the sea and weather conditions, Beophwan Jomnyeo Village Haenyeo School provides Haenyeo experience activities from June to mid-October.

Today, locals and tourists on Jindo Island and Modo Island can relive the elderly woman’s crossing of the Yellow Sea. Twice a year, once in May and once in mid-June, extremely low tides open a natural causeway connecting Jindo and Modo. The causeway is almost two miles long and over 120 feet wide. On each of these days, visitors and tourists from each island traditionally walk to the middle of the causeway to meet one another and celebrate.

The pavilion was built on the orders of King Gojong around 1873 and it is thought to have acted as a place of leisure and relaxation for the Joseon Dynasty kings and their family members. Following excavation work carried out in 2019, it was found that Hyangwonjeong had the traditional Korean system of heated floors called ondol. Pavilions of this period were often equipped with ondol heating systems, but what makes Hyangwonjeong unique is how the smoke travelled along the sides of the first floor, instead of going through the middle. The pavilion was constructed on an artificial island in the center of a lake called Hyangwonji. The lake is home to many large, beautifully colored carp and in season lots of lotus flowers. A bridge, Chwihyanggyo, connects the island and the pavilion to the rest of the palace grounds. Hyangwonjeong can be translated as “pavilion of far-reaching fragrance,” while Chwihyanggyo translates as “bridge intoxicated with fragrance.” Chwihyanggyo was originally located on the north side of the island, and was the longest bridge constructed purely of wood during the Joseon dynasty. Unfortunately, the bridge was destroyed during the Korean War. The bridge was reconstructed in its present form on the south side of the island in 1953, but was relocated to its original location on the north side during reconstruction work completed in 2019.",palaces islands architecture

Situated in Sangdo Station on Line 7 of the Seoul Metro, the company’s Metro Farm is a sleek, glass-encased plant nursery housing rows upon rows of hydroponic growing trays. Under the glow of LED lights and the attention of an automated tech network, 30 varieties of organic edible plants, including microgreens, flowers, and sprouts, thrive. According to Farm8, the subterranean vertical farm is 40 times as efficient as its more traditional counterpart. Even though the agricultural experiment occupies a modest 394 square meters of space, it produces around 30 kilograms of fresh vegetables daily. Most of those go directly into the salad bowls and smoothies of the 1,000-odd customers who frequent Farm8’s adjacent café. “We want to change the perception of farming,” Lee Hwang-myung, senior manager of the project, told Rest of the World. “We want to encourage people to see agriculture as something not of the past but as part of the future.” Interest in urban farming has been on the rise for some time in Asia, where innovators in some of the most densely populated cities in the world are seeking ways to reduce carbon emissions and ensure food security for their inhabitants. Since 2015, more than 60 urban farms have cropped up everywhere from former helicopter pads to the rooftops of shopping malls in Hong Kong. In Bangkok, the rooftop of Thammasat University is home to a sprawling 22,000-square-meter green oasis. In Seoul, the Metro Farm has already proven such a hit that Farm8 has installed four others in subway stations around the city. The serene, underground landscapes serve as both a viable food source and as promotion for the startup, which offers various tiers of its vertical farms to corporations and private individuals looking to make their space—and the world—a little greener.  Prices in Seoul can be steep, but the organic salads and vegetable juices at Metro Farm's café are kept intentionally affordable.

A band whose bass player asked Hoon to come up with a design for some weekend homes. Homes in which urban dwellers could liberate themselves from the fuzz of the city. Homes in which weekends would turn into rivers, flowing through time and design with a stunning landscape and the band’s music as the natural soundtrack.

Cheomseongdae, which roughly translates to “star-gazing tower,” is a cylindrical structure composed of 362 granite blocks, which some claim represents the 362 days of the lunar year. In total, there are 27 circular layers of stones, a number believed to reference the 27th ruler of the Silla Kingdom, Queen Seondeok, during whose reign the observatory was built. This numbers game continues further, as a window is placed strategically with 12 layers of stones above and 12 layers below, symbolizing the months of the year or the signs of the Zodiac. And if that weren’t enough symbolism for one small building, the four-sided base is also thought to represent the seasons. But regardless of the hidden numerical messages, the observatory is interesting in its own right. As one of the oldest scientific sites in the world, Cheomseongdae provides a window into how astronomy was conducted many hundreds of years ago. In those times, the line between astronomy and astrology was considerably blurred, and “astronomers” often reported their findings to the king’s court so that various decisions of governance could be made based on celestial activities. Despite its use for astrological predictions, Cheomseongdae was also the site of more traditional astronomical research. From the top of the tower, state-appointed astronomers made continuous observations 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, developing the ability to predict eclipses and chart the trajectories of comets. In fact, Cheomseongdae’s importance, in both the histories of Korea and astronomy, earned it the distinction of national treasure in 1962 and its image can even be found on Korean coins.",observatories retro-tech instruments of science architectural oddities architecture
70,Suguksa Temple,"Seoul, South Korea","The name of the only golden Buddhist temple in Korea translates as ""the temple that protects the country.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/suguksa-temple,"The gold glimmers between the buildings as cars drive by. Suguksa Temple sits in an assuming neighborhood in northwestern Seoul where tourists are few and far between. When the light catches the golden temple just right, it’s a glorious sight. The temple was built in 1459 after Crown Prince Uigyeong died at the age of 20. His father, King Sejo, had the temple, originally named Jeonginsa, built in the prince’s honor. In 1712, the temple was designated as the guardian temple for the tombs of King Sukjong and Queen Inhyeon buried at nearby Seooreung Royal Tomb grounds. Around that time, the temple’s name was changed to Suguksa, or “the temple that protects the country.”After a fire at the temple, it was left to ruin for some time until 1900 when it was rebuilt. At that time, King Sunjong became ill and King Gojong, his father, asked Monk Wol Cho to pray for him. King Sunjong became well again and because the monk’s prayers seemed to be quite effective, the king was impressed and wanted to give him riches. The monk declined the offer and instead asked for a gold-covered Buddhist sanctuary that ordinary citizens could visit. Today, the Buddhist temple shines with a special golden paper that has been applied to the front, while the other three sides have been painted gold.  Note that this is an active temple so be respectful when you visit, keep quiet, and remember that this is a holy site. Visit the golden building and then be sure to walk behind the building to find a path into the forest. Follow it up for more.",gold buddhism temples
71,Kosik the talking elephant,"Yongin-si, South Korea",Seoul amusement park boasts a Korean-speaking pachyderm.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kosik-talking-elephant,"In 2006, keepers at Seoul’s Everland amusement park/zoo complex were surprised to hear a voice coming from inside the elephant enclosure. Kosik, a 16-year-old elephant, had learned to talk (in Korean of course) by putting its trunk in its mouth and mimicking the words it heard from its caretakers: “yes,” “no,” “lie down,” “sit down,” and four other phrases. Perhaps surprisingly, Kosik is not the first talking elephant on record. In the 1970s, a pachyderm called Batyr kept in Kazhakstan’s Karaganda Zoo also learned to speak (in Russian), supposedly stringing together phrases like “Batyr is good” as well as verbs like “drink” and “give.” He also appeared on Soviet television, once swearing on a live broadcast. Though it has been shown that elephants do indeed have a sense of self awareness and are intelligent problem solvers and tool users, the question of whether the elephants are capable of expressive speech (as opposed to straight mimicry) has yet to be fully resolved. In the meantime, visitors flock to Kosik’s enclosure, hoping to catch a few words. From exit 1 of Yangjae Stn. (Subway Line 3) get bus 1500.

72,Bridge of No Return,"Paju, South Korea",The site of many tense prisoner exchanges across the Military Demarcation Line between North and South Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bridge-of-no-return,"Between 1953 and 1976, the Bridge of No Return was the scene of tense prisoner exchanges and highly charged incidents between North Korea and South Korea. The bridge crosses the Military Demarcation Line, separating the two sides of the DMZ, the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Starting at the end of the Korean War in 1953, prisoner exchanges were made across this bridge. Its name comes from the ultimatum given to prisoners of war before they crossed: They could stay in the country where they were formerly held captive or they could return to their homeland, but once they stepped over the line, there was no going back. The first major prison exchange, known as Operation Little Switch, took place in April 1953. The United Nations Command (UNC) exchanged 6,030 North Korean prisoners for 605 UNC prisoners, most of whom were sick or wounded. The fraught exchange was a success, and soon led to the start of Operation Big Switch. From August to December that year, 70,183 North Koreans and 5,640 Chinese POWs were exchanged for 12,773 UNC POWs from various nations, including 7,862 South Koreans, 3,597 Americans, and 945 British. Much to the bewilderment of the UN, 23 Americans and one Briton declined repatriation. The next major incident came in 1968 following the capture of the USS Pueblo by DPRK naval forces in international waters off North Korea. The captain and crew were held for 11 months. They were finally released and allowed to walk across the bridge, but only while a forced confession from the captain was blasted out over loudspeakers. It was the last prisoner exchange across the Bridge of No Return. Tensions again peaked, this time with fatal consequences, in August 1976. Two United States Army officers went out to trim a poplar tree in the Joint Security Area, which was obscuring the view between checkpoints near the bridge. When the U.S. soldiers went out to trim it, they were set upon and killed by axe-wielding North Korean soldiers, in what is now known as the Korean axe murder incident. The North Koreans built a new bridge following this incident, and the Bridge of No Return was never used again, at least not for prisoner exchanges. But it did still hit the headlines occasionally. In 1993, President Bill Clinton walked part of the way over the bridge, to within 10 feet of the demarcation line. He was naturally heavily guarded by a Secret Service escort, and carefully watched by AK-47-carrying North Korean soldiers on the other side. More recently, in August, 2016, the United Nations Command accused the North Korean army of planting land mines near the northern end of the landmark bridge. It was the first time North Korea had been seen planting mines near the bridge since the armistice of 1953. Now unused and barred by bollards at either end, the bridge nevertheless remains a potent symbol of the fraught history between the two countries, and between the United States and the North Korean regime. The bridge is located inside the Joint Security Area of the DMZ, and can be visited—but not crossed—by adventuresome tourists.  Visitors hoping to visit the Joint Security Area must sign up for an organized, approved tour of the DMZ that includes the JSA. Note that not all DMZ tours include the JSA, and that tour itineraries are often subject to last-minute changes based on security conditions.",borders bridges war history military

74,Sewoon Sangga (Sewoon Plaza),"Seoul, South Korea",Its humdrum facade only adds to its electrifying appeal: a rooftop with panoramic views of a shapeshifting metropolis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sewoon-sangga-sewoon-plaza,"Once a symbol of Korean modernization, Sewoon Sangga, a.k.a. Sewoon Plaza, was named to mean a place that “gathers the energy of the world.” No wonder, then, that the megastructure—originally comprised of eight bulky buildings stretching for more than half a mile—bizarrely resembles a concrete power strip plugged into the heart of Seoul. Rewind to early 1945, toward the end of World War II and final year of Japanese colonial rule of Korea, and your curiosity about Sewoon Sangga’s stretched-out structure is quelled. The Imperial Japanese government hastily cleared a more than 160-f00t-wide, nearly half-mile-long strip of inhabited land to prevent the spread of fires in the event of potential United States firebombing raids on Seoul. Then, with the Korean War, the evacuated lot turned into a shantytown for refugees and homeless people. But not for long. During the period of rapid postwar development in the late ‘60s, people in Seoul were awestruck—with wonder or dread of being displaced—by a novel plan to construct “a city within a city” on the deprived land. In fact, Sewoon Sangga was the first mixed-use residential and commercial complex in the country. Designed by Korea’s foremost architect Kim Swoo-Geun, it included a luxury apartment, a one-stop shopping mall, a school, and even a library for its residents. Soon enough, however, its novelty faded. Over time, the brutalist megastructure transformed into a magnet for seekers of porn and pirated media, an arcade outlet, and mainly an all-out electronics market during the ‘80s. There’s even a famous joke that Sewoon Sangga has everything you need to build a tank or nuclear submarine! Fast forward to today, and the megastructure, once on the brink of complete demolition (only one of the buildings was destroyed in 2009), is shifting its form yet again. This time, it’s being dubbed as “Makercity Sewoon” in light of a recent urban renewal project to revitalize the historic complex and to deliberately prevent gentrification—the first project of its kind in Seoul. Sewoon Sangga is now becoming a hub where you can find veteran artisans coexist and collaborate with young makers and entrepreneurs. Its floors are lined with an eclectic range of storefronts that include old-school printing shops, VR and robotics labs, classic eateries, hip cafes, and community spaces that seemingly promote maker culture. Not to be missed from its regeneration is Sewoon Sangga’s newly renovated public rooftop. The 25,058-square-foot space has lounging areas perfect for slowing down, a blooming urban garden, and, best of all, dramatic views of downtown Seoul you won’t find anywhere else. Depending on where you stand, you can see Jongmyo Shrine, Bugaksan Mountain, the industrial Euljiro neighborhood (sadly on the verge of being demolished), Namsan Seoul Tower, Gwangjang Market (arguably the best food market in Seoul), Cheonggyecheon, and more. Its rooftop is also a place that makes you ponder about the city’s ever-changing skyline, and whether Sewoon Sangga will keep transforming until it lives up to its utopian namesake.  Sewoon’s rooftop is open to the public from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. There’s an elevator in front of the entrance facing Jongmyo Shrine. Also, be sure to stop by the tiny, but worthwhile Sewoon Electronics Museum on the third floor (descriptions are in Korean).",brutalism shops architectural oddities architecture

The temple survived the Seven Year War largely unfazed, and was used as a refuge during the early Joseon Dynasty. Its resilience and ancient history has left it abundant with treasures, including manuscripts made with liquid gold and silver, bronze-tipped pagodas, of which only three remain in the world, and Chinese junipers planted by independence leader and scholar Kim Ku. Centuries-worth of ornate gates, paintings of dragons and saints, golden statues, watchful Bodhisattvas and a myriad of Buddhas are scattered about the carefully manicured grounds.

76,Dokdo/Takeshima (Liancourt Rocks),"Pohang, South Korea",Japan and South Korea both lay claim to islands inhabited by one woman.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dokdotakeshima-liancourt-rocks,"Known in Korea as Dokdo (Solitary Island) and in Japan as Takeshima (Bamboo Island), this group of disputed islets in the Sea of Japan (East Sea) administered by South Korea is known in English as The Liancourt Rocks. The islets are largely uninhabitable as they are mostly rocky with a total land area of just 0.18 square kilometers. But when Japan claimed the islands, the ensuing upsurge of anger resulted in a mother and son slicing off their own fingers and a man setting himself on fire. The islands may have been first conquered by Korea as long ago as the 6th century, but Japan claims that this was a different island, or even a non-existent one. Korea formally claimed the rocks in 1900, with Japan doing the same five years later. The rocks have been known by various names over the years, further clouding the issue of sovereignty. The English name comes from Le Liancourt, a French whaling ship that nearly crashed on the island in 1849. Though the tiny islands may seem irrelevant, the ownership is crucial to claiming the maritime boundary and the fishing and resource rights that accompany it. There are currently only two permanent residents on the island, Korean nationals Kim Seong Do, an octopus farmer, and wife Kim Shin Yeol. They are assisted by various support staff including 37 policemen and three lighthouse keepers. But Sung-do died in 2018, and now Shin-yeol is the only one left. The island was off-limits to tourists for many years, but now over 100,000 tourists visit the island every year. There was even a wedding on the islands in 2005. On February 22, 2005, Japan’s Shimane prefecture announced a “Takeshima Day” to celebrate 100 years of the annexation of the islands. Such action caused fury in Korea, where the memory of the brutal Japanese occupation still lingers. As well as the aforementioned self-mutilation and immolation, Koreans protested their anger by decapitating pheasants outside the Japanese Embassy. The issue is not one likely to be resolved soon, but South Korea can count on support from an unlikely source. In a rare and unexpected move, rival North Korea has supported South Korea’s claim to the islands.  The nearest land is Korean island Ulleung-do at a distance of 87 km. The nearest mainland is South Korea, 217 km to the west. Japan is 250 km to the south.",islands natural wonders nature

As mayor of Suwon in the 1990s and early 2000s, he led an effort to clean and beautify the city’s public toilets. He later founded the World Toilet Association, dedicated to doing the same for the world. Appropriately, he became known as “Mr. Toilet” by reputation. In 2007, in honor of the founding of the WTA, he demolished his home and had a new one made, designed by Go Gi-wong to look like a giant toilet. It was Sim’s dream house. He even named it Haewoojae, which translates to “a house to satisfy anxiety,” which is how restrooms are referred to in Korean temples. After he died, the house was donated to the city and turned into a toilet museum. The house itself is the largest toilet sculpture in Korea, and has two floors of exhibitions about how important toilets are to the health of a society. Toilet-themed art is exhibited inside the museum and around on the grounds, much of which, including a giant golden pile of poop, make for great photo ops.

78,38th Parallel Beach,"Yangyang, South Korea",A thriving surf community exists in relative remoteness along the former boundary between North and South Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/38th-parallel-beach,"A laid-back community of surfers has sprouted up in a place once rife with volatile political strain. From this stretch of golden-white sand, they enter the sea to catch waves in one of the country’s best under-the-radar surfing spots. After Japan ceded control of Korea toward the end of World War II, the country was sliced in half, with Soviet Russia taking control of the North and the United States occupying the south. This invisible line, drawn along the 38th parallel north, divided the formerly united country into two hostile pieces. It remained the barrier between North and South Korea until it was replaced by the Military Demarcation Line after the end of the Korean War. Though no longer part of the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the 38th parallel north still circles through an extremely politically charged part of the world. Yet surprisingly, it also runs across a sliver of beachy paradise, which is home to a military base, rest stop, and a small but thriving surf community. In-the-know Seoul residents make the three-hour journey on the weekends to take advantage of the clean break at the 38th Parallel Beach. They’re often joined by expats and other foreign surfers who were lured to the spot by whispers of superb waves. Though the military members marching nearby and barbed wire fences poking above the sand are stark reminders of the area’s lasting tensions, the surfers don’t let it kill their beachy vibes. They descend upon the remote beach throughout the year, sometimes wading through thick snow to catch waves in one of the most unique surfing experiences in the world. To get to the 38th Parallel Beach from Seoul, take a bus from the Dong-Seoul bus terminal to Hajodae.

The sleek, modern train station was completed in 2002, and for a short time, freight trains did travel back and forth between the Kaesong Industrial Complex, on the North Korean side of the border, and Dorasan. This was during the peak of then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung’s Sunshine Policy, which sought more cordial relations with the North. But it didn’t take long for tensions between the two nations to flare up once again, effectively shutting down the station and rendering it little more than a curiosity for tourists. The station connects to a much larger customs and immigration operation, including several warehouses and inspection bays. Today these buildings sit empty and unused. Inside the terminal, signs point non-existent Pyongyang-bound passengers to board trains that never come. An aspirational route map for a proposed Trans-Asian Railway system looms large across one wall. A souvenir shop in the corner, selling DMZ-themed coffee mugs and locally sourced chocolates, is one of the few hubs of any activity. In the South, the hope is that one day soon, the two Koreas might begin to trade with each other again. Should that day ever come, Dorasan sits ready and waiting. Since Dorasan Station is located inside the Civilian Control Zone (CCZ), it is highly recommended that you see it as part of an organized tour of the DMZ and surrounding area.

Home to South Korea’s only official Chinatown, the seaport town of Incheon is also the birthplace of one of the country’s most beloved foods: jjajang myeon, or noodles in black bean sauce. Created by an enterprising Chinese immigrant and loosely based on a Shandong Province noodle and ground pork dish, jjajang myeon is now synonymous with Chinese-Korean delivery. It’s also the dish over which black-clad South Korean singles meet and drown their sorrows every April 14, the country’s “Black Day” for the unhappily unpartnered. The museum features displays on the dish’s origin, a collection of its most popular packaged forms, and an eerily lifelike sculpture of a table of happy diners enjoying a noodley feast. While a small museum—tourists report taking only an hour to see the whole thing—it’s certain to leave you with an appetite. After touring the museum (which doesn’t actually serve the noodles), you can head over to one of the neighborhood’s many jjajang myeon joints for a sample of the real thing.

The 10-story marble building is hidden away in Tapgol Park, in the center of the busy city. The pagoda was constructed in 1467 as a part of Wongaksa Temple, which King Sejo had established two years earlier on the site of an older temple.  An inscription on the upper part of the pagoda states it was built in the 13th year of the king’s reign. The temple was closed and turned into a kisaeng house, then the site was turned into government offices. The pagoda and a memorial stele commemorating the foundation of Wongaksa were the sole surviving structures.  Even, they had a close call in the 16th century during the Imjin War. The top portion of the pagoda was pulled down and lay on the ground—it would not be replaced until 1947. In 1897, the financial advisor to King Gojong, was authorized to turn the area into Seoul’s first public park, now known as Tapgol Patk. In 1962, the pagoda was designated a National Treasure of Korea.  This title acknowledged an object’s value as either a tangible treasure, artifact, site, or building which is recognized by the government as having exceptional artistic, cultural and historical value to the country.  This explains why the pagoda is hidden in a somewhat ugly glass case that almost makes it look like a construction site. The pedestal supporting the pagoda is three-tiered. The first three stories follow the shape of the base and the next seven stories are squares. The pagoda is richly engraved, with images of dragons, lions, phoenixes, lotus blossoms, and religious icons including Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and the Four Heavenly Kings. The pagoda was carved to look as if it was made from wood despite being constructed from marble. The use of marble is in itself unusual, as most Korean pagodas are made of granite. Despite its lofty-sounding title, the pagoda seems to be generally uncrowded, even though it is in a free public park.",pagodas buddhism temples architecture

The pond was part of the complex, constructed on the orders of King Munmu in 674. The pond measures 200 meters from east to west and 180 meters from north to south. When viewed from above, it has an unusual shape that some say represents the outline of the country at the time of construction, acting as a kind of watery map of Korea. The pond contains three small islands and the surrounding area has a manufactured landscape of 12 small hills to the northeast. This pond was referred to as Anapji during the Goryeo and Joseon eras. In the 1980s, a pottery shard was found with the word wolji carved on it, which translates to “pond that reflects the moon.” It was decided that this must be the true name of the pond, and the site was renamed to Donggung and Wolji. Donggung and Wolji was a secondary palace used by the crown prince of the Silla Kingdom. Rare animals were brought in to the area to create an exotic garden fit for royalty. It also served as a banquet site for important national events. There is mention of a royal reception held by King Gyeongsun, in 931, by which time the Silla Kingdom was beginning to crumble. After the fall of Silla, the pond fell into disrepair for many centuries. In 1974, as part of the renovation project of historic sites around the city, Wolji was dredged and rebuilt. During the excavation, almost 33,000 artifacts were found in and around the pond. The abundance of discoveries include roof tiles, architectural materials, pottery, gilt bronze Buddha figures, jewelry, and small everyday items. These objects offer an insight to Buddhist art and everyday life during the Silla era. These are held in a special exhibition at the nearby Gyeongju National Museum. Research revealed that the pond had been surrounded by stone walls, and that five buildings once stood on the west and south sides. Some of these buildings are now recreated at the edge of the pond, including one that houses a diorama showing what the area would have looked like at its height. Waterway systems were also discovered. The city government tried to undertake further restoration work in 2018 but it was suspended because UNESCO opposed the project.

This site is the burial ground of two kings and a queen of the Joseon Dynasty. The westernmost area of the park is occupied by Seolleung, the tomb of King Seongjong who died in 1494. On this tomb are engravings of the twelve zodiac signs and the mound is surrounded by various sculptures of civil and military servants. A small shrine is located nearby. The tomb of Queen Jeonghyeon, Seongjong’s wife, was constructed after her death in 1530 to the east of Seolleung. It is surrounded by a stone fence. The easternmost tomb, known as Jeongneung, belongs to King Jungjong who died in 1544 and was the son of Seongjong. Originally buried at another site in Goyang, north of Seoul, he was moved here to be closer to his father. This tomb is also surrounded by some sculptures and a small temple. During the Japanese Invasions of Korea in the late 16th-century, the tombs were severely damaged but were later repaired. When the site started to become engulfed by the expanding city of Seoul during the 1960s, the area was restored and is now a wonderful city park.

87,Jusanji Pond,"Cheongsong, South Korea",Trees emerge from the surface of this small man-made reservoir.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jusanji-pond,"Tucked among the trees in the forest outside of Cheongsong, South Korea, this small body of water has drawn visitors from all over the world. Jusanji Pond is an artificial pond created in 1720 in a forested area that in 1976 became the Juwangsan National Park. The pond was built to serve as a reservoir that could provide a steady supply of fresh water to the lower agricultural land. It’s fairly diminutive, by most standards. When full, Jusanji Pond measures 100 meters (328 feet) in length and 50 meters (164 feet) in width, with a maximum depth of eight meters (26 feet). The pond’s real claim to fame is the beauty with which the nearby centennial trees have encroached on its banks. Centuries of growth have resulted in a mesmerizing interplay of water and branches, and the fog that often envelops the pond when the weather is cold only adds to its charm. The mystic aura of Jusanji Pond did not escape Korean director Kim Ki-duk, who used it as a central element in the 2003 movie Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter… and Spring. The plot of the movie revolves around the life of Buddhist monk that grew up at the floating temple. Long sequences of Jusanji Pond in different seasons are used to illustrate the stages in the monk’s life. A floating temple was built for the movie, but it was eventually dismantled to retain the natural atmosphere of the place. The best time to visit Jusanji Pond is spring and fall, when the trees in bloom and the dying leaves respectively are perfectly mirrored on the placid water of the pond. However, visiting the pond in winter also has its perks, with the fog, silhouette of the trees and frozen waters bestowing on the pond a spectral ambiance. Although it is never dry, the pond reaches its lowest levels of water in the summer, the least favorable season for a visit.",natural history national parks film locations lakes natural wonders water nature

89,Korean Axe Murder Incident Memorial,"Paju, South Korea",A monument to the two U.S. officers killed by North Korean troops while trying to trim a poplar tree.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/korean-axe-murder-incident-monument,"On August 18, 1976, two U.S. Army officers entered the Korean Demilitarized Zone to trim a poplar tree that was blocking the view of United Nations observers. When they were confronted by a group of North Korean soldiers, the situation quickly escalated, with tragic results. Captain Arthur Bonifas and First Lieutenant Mark Barrett had entered the Joint Security Area in the DMZ accompanied by Captain Kim of the South Korean Army, five Korean Service Corps (KSC) personnel, and 11 other men. Due to Joint Security Area regulations, not all the men were armed, but the KSC workers were carrying axes for pruning the branches of the poplar tree. Shortly after the workers began trimming the tree, a group of 15 North Korean soldiers appeared. In command of the group was Senior Lieutenant Pak Chul, a man the UNC soldiers referred to as Lt. Bulldog due to the numerous confrontations they’d had with him in the past. The North Koreans watched the men work for about 15 minutes, but then Pak decided to get involved. He aggressively told the UNC to stop pruning the tree, claiming, somewhat spuriously, that Kim Il Sung, the first Supreme Leader of North Korea, had planted the poplar himself, and personally supervised its growth. Captain Bonifas ignored Pak, turning his back on him and telling his detail to carry on. Pak sent a runner back over the nearby Bridge of No Return, which spanned the Military Demarcation Line between North and South Korea. Within minutes, a guard truck rumbled over the bridge, carrying about 20 more North Korean soldiers, all carrying crowbars and clubs. Pak once again ordered Bonifas to stop the pruning, and Bonifas once again turned his back on the bullish North Korean. According to a report by the U.S. Army War College written the year after the incident, Pak then proceeded to carefully take off his wristwatch, which he folded in a handkerchief and placed in his pocket. He then gave a simple order, in Korean: “Kill the bastards.” Pak’s men picked up the axes that had been dropped by the tree-trimmers, and attacked the two U.S. soldiers. Bonifas was beaten to death by at least five North Koreans. Barrett ran into a tree-filled depression, but was cornered and then hacked to death by a succession of axe-wielding North Koreans. The attack, which was over in minutes, was captured on video and in photographs taken by UNC guards from their observation posts. The Korean axe murder incident led to Operation Paul Bunyan, which took place three days later. The operation, named after a giant lumberjack in American folklore, was a carefully considered show of force by the U.S. and South Korea, one calculated not to escalate into outright war. The target of the operation: the poplar tree. On August 21, Task Force Vierra rolled into the Joint Security Area. The convoy of 23 American and South Korean vehicles stopped by the tree and felled it within 42 minutes. They were watched by at least 150 North Korean soldiers, who didn’t react. The stump of the poor poplar tree was deliberately left standing as a reminder to the North Koreans. Then, in 1987, it was uprooted and replaced by a stone monument with a brass plate dedicated to the two soldiers who lost their lives.  Most DMZ tours these days do not include this memorial, due to its sensitive location inside the JSA. If seeing it up close is a priority for you, you'll want to contact a tour company that offers customized tours, and keep on top of potential JSA closures and security statuses.",borders murder plaques military history memorials monuments military

According to legend, a young man’s father was deathly ill and he couldn’t afford the medicine that could save him. The young man worked as a servant for a rich man for one month in order to raise the money.  Even though he did a good job, the rich man refused to pay his salary. The young man was distraught that he could not save his father. As he sat lamenting the situation, a monk spoke with him and reminded him that his father had been ill without care for a month. The young man rushed home only to learn that his father had already passed away. The young man was determined to give his father a proper burial, but while carrying the coffin he slipped and dropped it into the ocean. The grieving son felt so bad about failing his father that he sat still in one place without eating or drinking until he turned to stone. These rocks later rose from the ocean to represent him and his father. Gatbawi is a natural sandstone-and-tafoni formation, and is considered one of the “8 famous spots of Mokpo”. Today, visitors can climb on hiking trails behind the rocks, but the only way to get a good look at them is from the ocean side, either from the Bohaenggyo foot bridge that circles the formation or by tour boat.

In the Naminara Republic’s case, it was simply to boost tourism. Located in the city of Chuncheon, the crescent-shaped Nami Island, also known as Namiseom, was formed in the Han River as the result of the construction of a dam in 1943. In diameter, it is approximately 2.5 miles wide. Its name comes from General Nam Yi, whose body is believed to be buried somewhere on the island. Nam Yi died at the age of 28 after he was falsely accused of treason, during the reign of King Sejo, and was deified posthumously. Nami Island is privately owned by a local company, and has been a popular tourist spot known for its rich nature since the 1960s.

Statues of this kind are not rare in Asia, but this one stands out thanks to its hat, so much so that it is known as Gatbawi Buddha, meaning Stone Hat Buddha. The granite sculpture is over 13 feet (four meters) tall and wears a wide, six-inch (15 centimeters) thick, flat stone as a hat or a gat, a traditional piece of Korean headwear. The statue dates back to the 9th-century and the Unified Silla period of Korea. Many stories surround the sculpture, beginning with its origin. According to legend, it was carved by a Buddhist monk named Uihyeon to lead his dead mother’s soul to heaven. While he was working, cranes flew around him to keep him warm at night and also brought him food three times every day. Another legend states that when a nearby town suffered from a drought, the villagers set the statue on fire causing it to become blackened. This brought upon a dragon and rain to wash the ashes from the sculpture. Perhaps the most important story surrounds the artifact’s ability to grant a single wish to whoever prays to the statue.

It is thought that this pagoda dates from the golden age of the Unified Silla Period but this is not known for sure. It is thought of as a non-standard pagoda because of its atypical shape and design.

The lions’ mouths are open to show their teeth while they look outward from their positions. A statue of a monk stands with hands clasped together in the center of the platform, surrounded by the four lions.  Suggestions are that this monk represents the mother of the Buddhist monk Yeongi, while the other statue of the monk on the stone lantern in front of the pagoda represents Yeongi himself, kneeling as a dutiful son offering her tea out of filial piety.

Borugak Jagyeongnu is a clepsydra, or water clock, an ancient device that uses the flow of water to measure time. Its design dates back to 1434, when scientist and inventor Jang Yeong-sil created the automatic device for King Sejong. Water flowing through the clock triggered a series of mechanisms that marked each hour with a distinct sound. Borugak Jagyeongnu consisted of a set of bronze and ceramic vessels. The water flowed through these vessels and gathered in the clock’s tall cylindrical containers. Upon reaching a specific level the water would trigger a lever, releasing metal beads that would strike the clock’s bells, gongs, and drums. The clock was designed to fulfill one of the king’s most important duties, informing the public of the exact time of day to ensure people knew when to rise, work, and rest. Time signals from Jagyeongnu were relayed to a bell pavilion responsible for announcing the opening and closing of Seoul’s city gates. In 1536, at the request of King Jungjong, a new clock was unveiled. It was an improved version of Jang’s original design that could automatically announce the beginning and end of the night curfew period. Though the original clock is long gone, some components of the second Borugak Jagyeongnu have survived. The National Palace Museum of Korea currently looks after the remains of the clock, which is designated one of the National Treasures of Korea. Only three water bowls and two cylindrical water containers remain, along with two bases for the ceramic vessels, which are kept separately in the Myeongjeonjeon Hall of Changgyeonggung. In 2018, Korea’s National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage removed the remaining pieces of the Borugak Jagyeongnu from Deoksugung for preservation and restoration. A series of inscriptions on the metal cylinders bear the names of people involved in the clock’s manufacture, but centuries of accumulated grime and corrosion made several of the inscriptions difficult to read. After clearing away the dirt and damage, conservationists were able to make out the names of four nobles and astrologists who had contributed to creating the timepiece. After conservation, the Jagyeongnu was moved to the National Palace Museum of Korea, which is located on the grounds of Gyeongbokgung. At the museum, you can also find a functioning scale model of the water clock. Unveiled in 2007, the scale model offers a small glimpse of what the Borugak Jagyeongnu looked like back when it was first built more than 500 years ago.",astounding timepieces time clocks instruments of science technology water

However, this one in particular had a very different purpose. Seokbinggo literally means “stone ice storage.” It is effectively an icebox made of stone and was the secret behind Korea’s ability to have ice in the middle of summer during the 1700s. This was a storage room where ice blocks cut from frozen lakes and rivers were taken during the winter for storage. They would then be used during the warm summer months. The key to its success was in its clever design, half of Seokbinggo is underground while the other half is above ground. This allows the internal temperature to stay relatively stable despite any rapid increase in the outside air temperature. To keep air from entering the chamber, a burial mound was created on top by mixing dirt and rocks. Next, the ceiling was fitted with ventilation shafts. When it was warm outside and the air inside warmed up, it then exited through the shafts. Letting the warm air escape in this manner helped keep the ice cool for a little longer. The floor, walls, and arched ceiling are made of granite. The walls are covered with limestone and are designed to keep off moisture and water. The floor is slanted, which allowed melted ice to funnel out. At the end of the sloped floor is a drain. Peering inside the metal gate, visitors will still be able to feel the coolness of the structure. This seokbinggo was moved to its current location in 1742, which can be verified by the keystone scripts on the entrance and the monument standing next to the storage. There are only seven seokbinggo still in existence today. It is said that the Gyeongju Seokbinggo is the largest remaining in South Korea and the best constructed.

During this period, known as Unified Silla, many grandiose palaces were constructed in the prosperous city. The Poseokjeong Pavilion was one of these structures, part of what once was a large royal villa probably dating back to the 9th-century. Sadly, the palace was destroyed and all that remains is a granite water feature that was located in the pavilion. This hand-carved, abalone-shaped watercourse was used to perform traditional drinking games. The nobles would sit around the canal during banquets, floating their alcohol-filled cups on the watercourse and sending them to their peers, challenging them to drink and recite poems when the cup stopped in front of them. During another game, the first person would recite a line of poetry and the next participant would have to continue with a fitting second line before the cup could reach them. The total length of the canal is 72 feet (22 meters) long, and thanks to its odd shape and many curves, the speed of the cups would vary greatly.",royalty water history & culture
107,Dilkusha House (Albert W. Taylor House),"Seoul, South Korea",The former home of a foreign correspondent who reported on Korea’s independence movement has been restored and is open to the public.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dilkusha-house-albert-w-taylor-house,"Nearly a century past its construction, a derelict colonial-style house in Seoul’s Jongno district has been restored. Its former residents—Albert W. Taylor, a Nevada-born businessman who worked in Korea’s mining industry, and his wife Mary L. Taylor, a British actor—witnessed and recorded critical moments in Korean history. In 1919, when Korea was under Japanese occupation, Albert was tapped to cover an abdicated Korean emperor’s funeral as a foreign correspondent. In the same year, Mary gave birth to their son at Seoul’s Severance Hospital. It was a moment of joy for the Taylors, but for the greenhorn newspaperman Albert, a thrilling discovery came into sight: a copy of the Korean Declaration of Independence, tucked under the sheets of his wife’s bed. It had been furtively printed in the hospital’s basement to prepare for one of the most significant events of Korea’s independence movement, and a nurse had hidden a copy. Albert was fluent in Korean by then and recognized the document. He filed a report via his brother, who stuffed the documents in the heel of his shoe, whisked it to Tokyo to avoid police surveillance, and cabled the American press. Later on, Albert further contributed to the Korean cause by reporting on a massacre by the Imperial Japanese Army and trials of Korean independence activists. But how the Taylors acquired Dilkusha House is another story less touched by serendipity. One day, Mary saw a large, centuries-old ginkgo tree and instantly became enamored with it. When the Taylors bought the parcel of land abutting it to build a house, they were met with protesting locals and a shaman’s malediction. But the couple was undeterred, and a two-story red-brick house was completed in 1924. They named their new abode Dilkusha—meaning “Palace of Heart’s Delight” in Hindi—after the Dilkusha Kothi Palace in India. In 1926, a lightning strike seared Dilkusha, destroying its roof and attic. The house was repaired in 1930,  and Albert etched a verse from the book of Psalms on a foundation stone, which is still visible today. The couple eventually bid a permanent farewell to Dilkusha when the Japanese government expelled them from Korea in 1942. After their departure, Dilkusha was sold off and briefly inhabited by a Korean politician, before his property was seized by the state in 1963. For decades, Dilkusha sat in state possession, abandoned but not entirely vacant. Squatters slinked in and settled over the years, sometimes more than a dozen households at a time. They were unaware of the house’s former owners, as were the rest of the community, until Bruce Taylor, Albert’s son, returned to Korea in 2005 and identified the house with the help of a Korean professor after a two-month search. It wasn’t until 2020 that the house was restored. At Dilkusha House, visitors can find news clippings, the Taylors’ portraits, and personal belongings, and rooms recreated from photographs.",journalism colonialism houses museums
108,Gyeonggyojang House,"Seoul, South Korea",The headquarters of Korea’s provisional government later became the site of a prominent statesman's assassination.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gyeonggyojang-house,"In Seoul’s historic Jongno district, a building with an elegant cream-colored front and a portico is nestled within a block patched with various medical facilities. Low-slung at a modest two stories, it has the qualities of an ornately crafted shoebox and is immediately distinguishable from the surrounding blocks of grey. The building, constructed in 1938, was first inhabited by a Korean mining mogul, who was a mercenary timeserver. In 1945, upon Korea’s liberation from the Japanese Colonial Empire, he donated it to state dignitaries to launder his pro-Japanese business records. The building’s original name was retired to further sever its Japanese roots and replaced with a stately, trisyllabic name of Gyeonggyojang. Then a government-in-exile, the Korean Provisional Government had caught wind of Japanese surrender and returned from Shanghai to set up an interim government. Gyeonggyojang became its headquarters. On the first floor, officials convened to oppose the four-power trusteeship of Korea and discuss the future reunification of the newly bifurcated country. In addition to the drawing room, foyer, center hall, and sunroom, there is a chandeliered and richly paneled dining room, next to which a dumbwaiter is installed to hoist meals from the basement kitchen. Most furnishings were provided by the previous owner when he donated his estate, though he and his hangers-on continued to poke in afterward to grouse about the nicked furniture or large crowds gathering in front of Gyeonggyojang. The second floor was statesman Kim Ku’s residence, study, and eventually the site of his assassination. It has traditional Japanese-style interiors, with tatami mats, translucent sliding doors, coffered ceilings, and built-in shelves in the alcove. These rooms are minimally furnished, save for an elaborate mother-of-pearl inlay table. Kim Ku, also known by his pen name Baek Bum, was a staunch nationalist who jostled for the new republic’s presidency upon returning from exile in 1945. In June 1949, he was shot four times in his office—a bullet each to the face, neck, chest, and lower abdomen—by a Korean army lieutenant who doubled as an agent for the U.S Army Counter Intelligence Corps. Kim Ku died immediately. When the room was restored, the bullet-cracked window near his desk, where he was practicing calligraphy at the time, was recreated. After Kim Ku’s death, Gyeonggyojang housed the embassies of Taiwan and Vietnam. It was acquired by the electronics juggernaut Samsung in 1965 and used as an entrance to an adjoining hospital, also owned by Samsung. In response to growing public demand for the restoration of historical sites, the building was refurbished using original architectural plans and reopened in 2013. The basement accommodates a permanent exhibition of Gyeonggyojang’s historical significance and a collection of artifacts, from handwritten letters to Kim Ku’s blood-stained clothes, death mask, and other personal effects.",assassination government colonialism houses museums
109,May 18th National Cemetery,"Gwangju, South Korea",This cemetery is dedicated to the people who died fighting for democracy in South Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/may-18th-national-cemetery,"Between May 18th and May 27th of 1980, a large uprising against the martial law government of South Korea exploded in the city of Gwangju. The military violently repressed the demonstration and, while the number of victims is disputed, it is argued that up to 2,000 people died in the uprising. The Gwangju Uprising, also known as May 18th Democratic Uprising, had a profound impact on South Korean politics and eventually paved the way for the democratization of the country in the 1980s. Initially, the victims of the uprising were buried in the local Mangweol-dong Cemetery, with many bodies carried in handcarts and garbage trucks. Also, as the graveyard became known as a “holy ground for democracy,” the military wanted to destroy the cemetery but their plans never came to fruition. After the democratization of South Korea, a new graveyard was constructed. The May 18th National Cemetery opened in 1997 and was officially designated as a national cemetery in 2002. The bodies of the victims of the uprising were moved here while the old cemetery was restored. A monument for the victims was also erected, along with a memorial hall and numerous statues. Now, every May 18th, a commemoration is held and citizens visit the cemetery to honor those who died while fighting for democracy.",cemeteries history & culture
110,Guryongpo Japanese House Street,"Pohang-si, South Korea","Originally built by Japanese fishermen, this historic neighborhood has withstood the test of time.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guryongpo-japanese-house-street,"Legend has it that, during the reign of King Jinheung of Silla, the county magistrate of today’s Guryongpo witnessed an extraordinary sight: ten dragons soared skyward as a sudden storm raged, and a bolt of lightning hit one of them, causing it to fall into the sea. This somehow calmed the storm and the county was later named Guryongpo, meaning Nine Dragons’ Beach. Located on the near-easternmost point of Korea facing the Sea of Japan, this eup (town) became home to Japanese immigrants around 1906. Most of them were fishermen from the village of Oda in Kagawa, who were seeking new fishing grounds as the Seto Inland Sea grew fraught with rivalries between locals. For them, Guryongpo was quite an ideal location, since it was so abundant in fish that boats would topple over under the weight of massive hauls. By the 1930’s, 10,000 Japanese people had moved to Guryongpo-eup, creating a moderate-sized Japantown around the houses of Togawa Yasaburo and Hashimoto Zengichi. Hashimoto’s former house has been renovated and stands today as the Guryongpo Modern History Museum. The town’s flourishment, however, was not all fun and games (especially in retrospect). Its heyday came right after the Empire of Japan’s occupation of Korea in 1910, which heavily exploited its people. Although the colonial rule itself ended along with World War II, its repercussions persist to this day. The Japanese immigrants returned to their country after the war, but their houses were kept intact in spite of the nationwide movement to remove imperial influence from the country, preserving the Japantown of old. In the meantime, the fishing in Guryongpo remained as plentiful as ever until the end of the 20th century, when its population started to decrease. To give a new boost to the economy of the region, the city started to renovate the old neighborhood in the early 2010’s as a tourist attraction called the “Guryongpo Japanese House Street.” It’s almost like a piece of Showa-era Japan thrown into modern South Korea, an intriguing time capsule that has come through the shadows of colonialism.",design history & culture architecture

112,Sigiriya,"Sigiriya, Sri Lanka",An ancient stone fortress considered by many to be the eighth wonder of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sigiriya,"An ancient stone fortress used by a king of Sri Lanka as a place to build his palace and hide from his brother’s attacks, Sigiriya (The Lion Rock) is often considered the eighth wonder of the world. Situated in the central Matale District of Sri Lanka, the fortress is surrounded on all sides by the remains of an extensive network of reservoirs and gardens. These gardens are believed to be some of the oldest landscaped gardens anywhere in the world. The Lion staircase leading to the palace garden at the top of the rock is the most significant feature of this geological masterpiece. An intricate construction, the Lion staircase is a tile-covered walkway that emerges from the open mouth of the beast from which it takes its name and is built of brick and timber. The bricks surround ancient limestone steps. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, this rock is full of archeological importance. The other primary feature that draws thousands of tourists every year is the surviving frescoes and other paintings. The few paintings that survive are the earliest examples of a Sri Lanka school of classical realism, which was fully formed by the 5th century when the paintings at Sigiriya were produced. There are also remains of paintings in some of the caves that are nestled at the foot of the giant rock. According to ancient texts, the entire rock fortress was built by King Kashyapa and, after his death, was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. Today it is a popular tourist destination and one of the first places added to Sri Lanka itineraries. The climb is accessible to people of all ages and levels of fitness.  Sigiriya is situated 17km from the popular town of Dambulla. It is a relatively easy climb, but it can take up to an hour to complete due to the crowds. The main difficulty is the heat, so it is recommended to arrive early in the morning. The best time to visit Sigiriya is between January and April due to the favourable weather and to avoid monsoon season. Tickets are around US$ 30. No special dress code is required, but sensible shoes are recommended.",cultures and civilizations geological oddities natural wonders geology nature

Some of the baby elephants orphaned as a result of this are rehabilitated at the Elephant Transit Home, located on the fringes of the Udawalawe National Park in southern Sri Lanka. The elephant calfs are fed and sheltered during their early years, and once they reach the age of four or five, they are released back into a protected environment and monitored. The park itself is home to nearly 250 elephants, one of the highest concentrations in the country, including some young elephants released from the Transit Home.  The giant Asian elephant is the park’s biggest draw, and visitors are sure to get their fill of these and other creatures before the tour is up. Situated about a five-hour drive away from Sri Lanka’s commercial capital of Colombo, Udawalawe National Park stretches out over 30,000 hectares of grassland across the provinces of Uva and Sabaragamuwa to the island’s south. Visitors can tour through the scrublands, keeping eyes peeled for sightings of everything from wild foxes to wild boar, mongooses to macaques, water buffalos and deer of the sambar and spotted varieties. While the park is not known for playing host to big cat species such as leopards, it does feature some species of medium-sized cats like fishing and jungle cats. The park’s massive Uda Walawe Reservoir attracts a generous number of water-based birds. Some of the water bird species that are a common sight at the park are the Eurasian spoonbills, black-headed ibis, painted stork and spot-billed pelicans, as well as local bird species like the brown-capped babbler, red-faced malhoka, grey hornbill and spurfowl.  The park can be reached by using public buses or private taxis. You also have the option of making part of your journey by flight, for example from Colombo to Hambantota, and then travelling the rest of the way to the park by road. Once you get to the park, you will have to pay entrance fees to enter. Do note, that, while for Sri Lankan passport holders the fee is usually a fairly nominal amount, if you are a foreigner or a member of the Sri Lankan diaspora holding a foreign passport, you will be asked to pay a significantly higher fee.",elephants fauna national parks birds natural wonders nature animals

Situated in the bustling Pettah district, one of the oldest parts of the city of Colombo, its tall minarets are seen from almost every street, towering over the hustle and bustle of the busy neighborhood streets. It is said that the Red Mosque has been a landmark for sailors approaching the port of Colombo ever since it was built in 1908, and upon looking at it you can easily imagine that being true. The mosque’s distinct red-and-white pattern, whether swirling or spiraling or alternating, is quite mesmerizing. The domes are built in the shape of pomegranate (unlike the traditional onion shape), and the colorful brick patterns are meant to convey the same image. The Red Mosque, also known as Rathu Palliya in Sinhala, and Samman Kottu Palli in Tamil, was built in what is called Indo-Saracenic style, and is reminiscent of the Jamek Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (constructed around the same time). Words cannot convey how exciting it is to see the mosque’s tall minarets and domes from the streets of Pettah, with its busy markets, shops, and bazaars. Pettah literally means “outside of the fort” and has for centuries been a trading outpost. Pettah is a curiosity, with narrow streets and shops overflowing with anything you can think of. But nothing compares with seeing this magnificent structure rising above it all. It's possible for women to enter and look around as tourists, just please note that you will need to cover your hair and arms and legs.

115,Adam's Peak,"Rochor, Sri Lanka","Once thought to be the Garden of Eden it holds a holy footprint claimed to belong to Adam, Buddha and Shiva.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sri-pada-adam-s-peak,"In the Middle Ages, the Garden of Eden was commonly believed to exist on earth—probably on top of a mountain, or on an island, in order to have survived Noah’s Flood. For those looking to find the exact location of the biblical garden, “East” was a popular direction to start looking in. In 1358, a Florentine monk believed he had found what he was looking for on a very tall mountain on the island of Sri Lanka. Located sixteen kilometers northeast of the city of Ratnapura, Adam’ s Peak - also known as the Samanalakanda in Sinhalese and Sivanolipatha Malai in Tamil - rises 7,360 feet above sea level, and offers an unobstructed view over land and sea. Giovanni Marignolli, who traveled the East for 15 years, declared that this particular mountain was “so close to the earthly paradise that from its top one could see paradise were it not for the cloud cover that hides it from view.” At the top, there is what looks like a fossilized footprint; Marignolli claimed it was Adam’s. The foot-shaped depression is known as the Sri Pada or “sacred footprint” and still holds religious meaning though the claim has gotten more contentious. The Hindus claim the footprint belongs to Shiva while the Buddhists claim the Sri Pada belongs to the Buddha, while Christian and Muslim Sri Lankan’s agree that the print definitely belongs to Adam’s ancient foot. The mountain has been climbed for more than a thousand years, and boasts an illustrious list of famous pilgrims including the Arab traveler Ibn Batuta, and possibly, Alexander the Great. It remains a major shrine site and hiking trail today.",rites and rituals

But the main attraction is the island’s many juvenile and adult blacktip reef sharks. These sharks are up to five feet long and are reliably seen in an area next to the larger of the two islands, known as Shark Point Reef. This nonaggressive species seems to be quite accepting of humans in the water, and snorkelers have an almost guaranteed opportunity to see them—sometimes as close as a couple meters away in water as shallow as a meter deep. It is one of the few places where totally inexperienced snorkelers can have as good a chance of a shark encounter as fully qualified scuba divers. Pigeon Island National Park actually consists of two islands: large and small. It is a marine national park in Sri Lanka located in the general area of the city of Trincomalee and contains some of the best remaining coral reefs of Sri Lanka. Many of the 100 species of corals and 300 coral reef fishes recorded around the area are found in this national park. The coral reef is visited by Hawkesbill Turtle, Green Turtle and Olive Ridley Turtle and the island is important breeding ground for the rock pigeon. The area was badly affected by the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 but has now largely recovered. The map pin shows the best place to enter the water to see the sharks. The best conditions for snorkelling or diving on this side of Sri Lanka is from late March to Late October. The Sri Lanka Navy runs a holiday resort for navy personnel families on Nillaveli beach and runs its own  boats out to the island which makes it quite busy at times The nearest town is the tourist town Nillaveli. The national park is situated about 1000 meters off Nillaveli Beach. From here you can take a motor boat out to the island. The boat fee usually includes the entry fee to the national park.

Stems sprout from sculpted pots, while elsewhere pink flowers erupt into a dazzling, colorful display. It’s an enchanting place, one where its creator’s personality and love for the landscape come alive. Brief Garden is the masterpiece of Bevis Bawa, brother of the famous Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. Bevis, the elder Bawa brother, began crafting this luscious landscape roughly 20 years before Geoffrey commenced work on his world-famous Lunuganga Estate. Bevis created the garden by spending decades transforming the rubber plantation he inherited into the verdant jungle-esque gem it is today. He began cultivating the space in the late 1920s while serving in the army and continued up until he died at age 89 in 1992. Thankfully, the estate is still maintained and open to the public. It errs on the wild side for a garden, with tangles of vines creeping down the walls of the buildings. It has an intimate atmosphere, making you feel as though you’ve left the town behind and stepped into your own secluded slice of the jungle. Narrow paths wind through tropical plants, revealing a pool, patio, and staircase. Archways cloaked in greenery lead to hidden statues like carved faces and a stoic horse tucked among the flora. The house, too, is worth a peek. The art within it and the garden reflect Bevis’ personality and life. Homoerotic sculptures dot the space, and a stunning mural depicting Sri Lankan life adorns one of the walls. If you’re in Colombo, you can easily arrive at the Brief Garden within two hours' drive. One has to buy a ticket to get in, but it’s nothing too expensive, and the tour lasts about an hour and a half and is definitely an experience you won’t soon forget. The antique sculptures are prohibited from being interacted with so children should always be accompanied by adults. One should also dress light since the weather is fairly tropical, and carry an umbrella since rain is also quite common.",horticulture landscapes gardens houses homes plants

119,Pettah Floating Market,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Pettah's beautiful floating market was once a stinky canal in a sketchy industrial area.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pettah-floating-market,"The Pettah Floating Market is a recent development in Bastian Mawatha, which lives in the Pettah neighborhood of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Now a calm spot for shopping and a quiet stroll, it was once a chaotic canal-side area of rundown warehouses, stinky water, and dubious characters involved in equally questionable activities. In the 1990s, the area now occupied by the floating market was one of the most dangerous zones in Pettah. Dilapidated buildings and abandoned factories lined the old colonial canal side, and pushy hawkers, drug dealers, and other nefarious types had turned the area into a place most people tried to avoid. In the last few years, as Colombo began a series of ambitious beautification projects, this part of Pettah was a prime target for redevelopment. The local council brought in the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to tidy up the area, who in turn contacted the Ministry of Defense for assistance. Engineering units were brought in from the Sri Lanka Army and Sri Lanka Navy, who began to redevelop this part of Bastian Mawatha. Looking to transform the area, the UDA then called on a young architect named Thushari Kariyawasam. His vision led to today’s floating market, an oasis of calm in busy Colombo, with smooth cement paths and polished wooden walkways running along and over the widened—and cleaned—canal. Along these walkways are a series of red-roofed pagodas, in which more than 90 stalls have been allocated to local street vendors, many of whom were uprooted during this and other developments, but who were allowed to move back into the new stalls. They had to pay rent, unlike before, and some, unfortunately, didn’t last for long—but those that remained have found a far more relaxed way of making a living. The stalls sell a wide range of products, including electronics, clothes, shoes, jewelry, local handicrafts, fruit, and vegetables. Some are also snack bars selling local specialties to hungry tourists and amorous locals out for romantic sunset strolls along the walkways. The redevelopment project hasn’t been a total success. Traders still complain about high rent and low sales, and stalls often remain shut for long periods of time. Some visitors, meanwhile, are somewhat put off by the occasionally smelly water, which can become overly malodorous especially during the heat of the summer. Still, it’s a fine place for a quiet wander, some casual shopping, and pretty photos at sunset.  You don't have to pay to enter the Pettah Floating Market. There are entrances at the west and east ends; the main entrance is on the west side, but either will do. It's open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. To get there, take a bus to Pettah Bus Station or Bastian Mawatha Bus Station.

The cave was also the site of a remarkable archaeological discovery that dug up human skulls dating back about 37,000 years—the remains of one of the region’s oldest prehistoric human settlements. Surrounded by tropical greens, the mammoth cave measures 200 feet long, with an entrance 175 feet high and 160 feet wide, and sits 400 feet above sea level. There are areas inside the cave which are over 400 feet high. As archaeological research is still being conducted, many of the cave’s natural tunnels have been blocked. Aside from research, the cave is also the home of a Buddhist temple. A local monk used a heavy stone tool to clear the cave entrance and level the ground. Visitors to the cave are greeted by the temple’s 40 foot long reclining Buddha statue. Beyond the cave’s natural beauty, the archaeological finds within it make it a remarkable piece of history. In addition to the human skulls the Sri Lankan Archaeological Departments found, they also discovered weapons from the same era. These weapons, made from animal bones and stones, were used to kill deer, monkeys, porcupines, and other animals. According to researchers, evidence found in the cave suggests that these early humans also ate “a few types of edible snails and wild breadfruit.” Researchers have also discovered that after eating the snails, the cave’s earliest residents would pierce their shells to make jewelry. Getting to the cave can be a bit of a struggle, with about a 20 minute walk up stone steps (without a railing), but it’s a popular spot for school trips and picnickers.  A long walk and semi-strenuous climb is required to visit the Pahiyangala Cave, but compared to the other historic sites in Sri Lanka, the climb and walk, in this case, is minimal. Located about 40km away from Colombo, this is a close site and is an easy drive too. The place is accessible from Kalutara and Horana and when you take the Piliyandala Bulathsinghala Road and pass the rice fields and villages, you’ll find yourself at the stony path that leads up to the cave’s entrance. The steps in the path are cemented, but you’d find natural stone steps in between, and they must be stepped on carefully as they have jagged edges and can cause discomfort if stomped on. The excavation pit is open to visitors, and if you’re curious, you can walk down the stairs and into the pit and take a look at the digs with your own eyes. Within the cave, you’d find an ancient door that leads you into the bat cave, not like DC, but real bats that can hit you in the face when they fly out, so step in with care!",prehistoric buddhism rock formations temples rocks caves ecosystems geology
121,Saint Anthony’s Church and Cemetery,Sri Lanka,The ruins of this old church are slowing sinking into the sand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saint-anthonys-church-and-cemetery,"On the far northeastern beaches of Sri Lanka there is a tiny village called Manalkadu. It doesn’t see many tourists—and with only one battered unnamed road to get there, that’s not surprising. What is surprising, once you do arrive, is finding the ruins of a once-majestic church, and a collection of modest graves nearby, watching as the walls are slowly eaten by sand. The church is the old St. Anthony’s, but exactly how old is a little murky. Some accounts date it to the 17th century, during the period of Dutch rule. Others put the date around 1900, when Sri Lanka was the British colony known as Ceylon. Whatever the age, the effect of the stone, brick and coral walls slowly sinking into the dunes provides an eerie and striking backdrop to the modest cross markers that dot the sand, and the deep blue Indian Ocean just beyond. The crosses are the graves of local residents, many of whom were among the thousands of Sri Lankans who lost their lives in the 2004 tsunami. As with the church walls, the dunes around the graves are always shifting, the sand revealing either too much or too little of what’s buried below. The history of Sri Lanka goes back at least 3,000 years, to the days of the ancient Silk Road. Until 2014 it was difficult to get a visa to visit the area of the old St. Anthony’s, but tourism has since opened up as the political and economic conditions in Sri Lanka have improved.

It is on the Jaffna peninsula at the very northern tip of the island. Many of the area roads are unnamed, so you can set your GPS to the coordinates up top. Note that there is a new, rebuilt St. Anthony’s in the village, not to be confused with the ruins. Also, there are reports from some tour sites that the beaches around Manalkuda are patrolled by the army.

122,The Main Line,"Nanuoya, Sri Lanka","Known as the most scenic route in Sri Lanka, this train line is steeped in history and offers an unparalleled view of the country.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-main-line,"The Main Line was the name given to this railway line by the British who are often credited with its construction beginning around 1874. It was the first major line constructed on the island and was originally designed to link tea growing estates in the mountains to the port at Colombo. However, while the desire to build the railroad came from the British, many of its key elements were constructed and designed by a group of talented local engineers. This fantastic railway line runs from Colombo Fort station to Badulla, some 182 miles to the east. It passes through both natural and cultivated countrysides, which include quite a few tea plantations. The breathtaking views and natural beauty are complemented by the train’s journey through various towns and villages. Even express trains along this line only travel at about 15 mph through the winding mountain terrain, allowing for passengers to soak in their surroundings. One of the more unique features along the line is the Demodara Railway Loop. This is a junction where the track spirals sharply, passing over itself to gain height in a short distance. Such configurations are not uncommon on railways in mountainous regions, but what makes this one so unique is the station that sits directly over the tunnel, allowing the line to cross itself. It’s said that the engineer who designed the loop was inspired by watching a man tie and retie his Talappawa. There is a famous train service along the Main Line called the Blue Train, which runs from Kandy to Ella. It’s a very popular trip among tourists due to the modern carriages and air-conditioned first class. The trains themselves are Chinese built, diesel multiple units, with a power car and driving cab at each end. However, the intercity services, which run all the way to and from Colombo Fort Station, are hauled by traditional diesel locomotives and include a much more diverse range of coaches. The second and third class coaches have opening windows and provide better views than first-class, making for better photo ops. Many of the trains also include a special observation car at the rear. It’s arguably the best way to experience the journey; with a marvelous view along the backend of the tracks. One of the most well-used stations is Nanu Oya, which is the closest one to the mountain resort of Nuwara Eliya. It was here that British colonials decamped during the hot summer months.  The coordinates are for Nanu Oya station which is the 63rd station on the line from Colombo Fort. When getting off at Colombo Fort, hold onto your ticket until well outside the station, checkpoints seem to be numerous and random. You need to book the train a couple of days in advance to ensure you get the seat of your choice. Buying tickets on the day is cheaper, but with a 5-6 hour journey in first class, including advanced booking, at about £5, the cost is not really an issue. If you have the time, a return route from Nanu Oya to Kandy by road (two buses per hour but a 4-5 hour trip, some are air-conditioned) will take you past some spectacular scenery you don't see on the train and is worth the extra time.",railroads trains infrastructure bridges
123,Buduruwagala,"Buduruwagala, Sri Lanka","Seven beautiful 1,000-year-old rock-cut Buddhist statues.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buduruwagala,"Buduruwagala is a rock temple dating back to the ninth or 10th century. It consists of seven ancient Buddhist figures carved into the face of a large cliff. The largest measures 51 feet high, making it the tallest Buddha statue in Sri Lanka. The giant Buddha figure is situated at the center of the cliff face, flanked by three smaller statues on both sides. On the right are depictions of the Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, the Goddess Tara, and Prince Sudhana; on the left are Maitree Bodhisattva, and Vajrapani Bodhisattva. These are figures from the Mahayana tradition of Buddhism. A faint orange hue is visible on the tallest statue, suggesting that the carvings were probably painted originally. Several square niches are carved into the rock above the statues; their use is not known. By the right foot of the Buddha is a 4-foot-high hole shaped like a flame. The deepest reaches of this hole are always wet with a substance that smells like mustard oil. It is speculated that Buduruwagala (which roughly translates to “rock with Buddha statues”) was a hermitage site for Mahayana Buddhist monks, but no information other than the approximate age of the carvings has come to light so far. These days, a modern building houses a small number of monks that reside here.  Buduruwagala can be reached from either Wellawaya or Thanamalwila. The last 2.5 miles (4 km) are on a dirt track through a set of lakes, home to egrets and herons.",buddhism temples rocks ancient religion geology sacred spaces statues
124,Adam's Bridge,"Mannar, Sri Lanka","According to Hindu belief, this shallow island chain was created by a god with an army of monkeys.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adams-bridge,"Sri Lanka is an island, or at least that’s what they want you to think. The 18-mile gap between it and India is filled with shoals and sandbanks, that religious tradition holds are the remains of a bridge built by Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. And actually, some scientists now believe that the clerics might have a point. A thin strand of shoals, some only feet below the sea, stretch from India to Sri Lanka. The British Empire made a sort of steampunk Chunnel, going from rail to steamship, a century ago. Plans to blast open the rocks for shipping have run aground on something unexpected: religious Hindus who believe Adam’s Bridge to be a relic from the Ramayana epic. The story goes that Rama set an army of monkeys to work building a bridge to the island redoubt of the demon king Ravana. It may sound far-fetched to secular ears, but there are records from as late as the Medieval era that describe an international walking path. India’s ruling party has refused to permit construction of the shipping channel. Satellite imagery is undeniable; a filament connects the landmasses just under the surface. Photographs or videos aren’t enough to make any case closed. Religion or obstruction, history or myth, it’s in the eye of the analyst, but the underwater land link is definitely there. Plenty of tour agencies have taken advantage of the barely submerged islands, putting the rocky outcroppings on the “Rama Trail” of Sri Lanka’s Hindu legacy. A traveler could do that, or perhaps rent out a private boat. They wouldn’t see anything that hasn’t been argued about online. But at least a traveler could see it for himself.",hinduism monkeys legends geology
125,Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",This elaborate temple was built around one of the Buddha's teeth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-of-the-tooth,"Located in the appropriately-named-to-Western-ears town of Kandy in Sri Lanka, the Temple of the Tooth offers some sweet Eastern architecture surrounding a religious relic. According to local tradition, the Buddha’s tooth was given to the Sri Lankan monarchy in ancient times. Whoever holds the relic is said to hold the governance of the country. The tooth was passed around through various kings and holy men who hid, moved, and relocated the sacred relic across centuries. Now the tooth is housed in a dedicated temple inside the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy. Worshipers can visit the relic, which is held in a golden stupa inside the two-story shrine. The relic is encased in seven golden caskets which are engraved and inlaid with precious gemstones. Although parts of the shrine were destroyed and rebuilt over the years in various bombings and acts of war, the building still retains its opulent style of gold and moonstone, surrounded by Buddhist carvings and offerings. This piece of peace may be small, but the Temple of the Tooth makes it seem as important as the Buddha himself.",buddha's tooth teeth relics shrines buddhism
126,Wewurukannala Vihara,"Dikwella, Sri Lanka","To gaze upon the visage of Sri Lanka's biggest Buddha, one must first pass through the Tunnel of Hell.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wewurukannala-vihara,"Wewurukannala Vihara is most famous for a gargantuan seated Buddha waiting to greet devout pilgrims, but the temple’s most wonderfully unexpected (and unsettling) feature lies somewhere along the way. The temple is divided into three parts, the oldest of which dates back to the 18th-century reign of King Rajadhi and has a more modest Buddha worked into the structure’s outward-facing architecture. The second element, the giant Buddha statue, was constructed in the 1960s when a penchant for larger-than-life roadside attractions took the world by storm. At 160 feet tall, it literally and figuratively rises above the quagmires of earthly life. Which leads to the third, most overlooked, aspect of Wewurukannala Vihara: in order to meet the big Buddha up-close, visitors must first navigate the Tunnel of Hell. Down in the tunnel, life-sized models illustrate what will happen should one succumb to all those earthly temptations lining the path to enlightement. It is Buddhist Hell made tangible, played out in cartoonish horror before visitors’ eyes. Highlights include immersion in boiling cauldrons, disembowelment, and sinners being hacked to pieces by human-like demons with fangs. The end result is a visit to Wewurukannala Vihara and its message reads as strikingly one in the same: Don’t stop in the middle, for a serene paradise awaits just on the other side. At the town of Dikwella, 22km from Matara, a road turns inland towards Beliatta. The temple is approximately 1.5km down the road.",giant buddhas horror temples statues
127,Koneswaram Temple,"Trincomalee, Sri Lanka",An ancient temple to the Hindu god Shiva surrounded by jaw-dropping scenery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koneswaram-temple,"On a spectacular promontory overlooking one of the world’s largest natural harbours, there is an ancient temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. It is at the head of Konesar Malai (Swami Rock) on the dramatic Gokarna Bay, a seasonal home to blue whales. Surrounded by jaw-dropping scenery on all sides, the colourful Koneswaram temple sits high above the bay, a classical-medieval complex in the Eastern Province city of Trincomalee. The site is a religious pilgrim centre, and is one of the five “Pancha Ishwarams” (abodes of Shiva) that were built in coastal regions of Sri Lanka to honor the supreme god of Hinduism. The dates of the temple have been debated, with some scholars citing the original to around 400 BC, and later construction from as early as the 5th century to as late as the 18th. At one time the complex was as large and grand as any in India or Sri Lanka. The grandeur was mostly lost in the 17th century at the hands of the colonial Portuguese, who razed structures, dumped some into the sea, destroyed objects, and smashed ornamentation. To salvage what they could, priests and devotees of the temple scrambled to bury their sacred objects, even taking advantage of the sea itself rather than seeing them crushed in the raid. The original temple is claimed by some to have been the greatest building of its age, for both its architecture and its ornamentation. It combined key features to form a typically southern Indian plan, such as a thousand-pillared hall (similar to the famous “Aayiram Kaal Mandapam” in Madurai, India) and raised platform (or “jagati”) configuration, features that had been destroyed. It was said that its gopuram (gateway tower) was visible to sailors approaching Sri Lanka from the sea. The evidence for this magnificence comes from unearthing the very remnants that were buried, as well as the discovery of key pieces at the bottom of the bay. They were found by photographer Mike Wilson and science-fiction author, Arthur C. Clarke. In 1956, Wilson and Clarke uncovered masonry, idol images, carved columns with flower insignias, and elephant head carvings while scuba-diving. More importantly, they also retrieved the legendary Swayambhu lingam;  a large stone phallus / obelisk said to originate from a Tibetan mountain top. Upon reinstalling the lingam to the temple, Wilson was so overwhelmed by the experience that he renounced his career and family to become a Hindu swami. As well as the recovered underwater pieces, there are also some original drawings done by Constantino de Sá de Noronha, the Portuguese governor responsible for the destruction. Restoration work was completed in 1963 with the old pieces reinstalled. Today the site is reborn, and there is some quite modern construction as well. And while the current site does not match up to the pre-1624 temple, it is still an awe-inspiring place to visit, for Hindus and non-Hindus alike.  The temple is on the northeastern coast of Sri Lanka, at the very end of Konesar Road. Continue past Fort Frederick (currently an army base, and formerly a British colonial fort) and follow the path lined with shops. You’ll walk through various courtyard shrines, eventually reaching the giant statue of Shiva at the promontory. The temple requests all visitors to please respect the religious customs and propriety, including appropriate dress. Be prepared to remove your shoes.",hinduism temples ancient religion sacred spaces

129,Richmond Castle in Kalutara,"Kalutara, Sri Lanka","This palatial, 99-doored Colonial mansion is a marvel of architectural fusion.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/richmond-castle-kalutara,"Once upon a time in the land known to many as “paradise,” there lived a wealthy landowner and philanthropist by the name of (brace yourself) Padikara Mudali Nanayakkara Rajawasala Appuhamilage Don Arthur de Silva Wijesinghe Siriwardena. Don Arthur de Silva, as he is more commonly known, dreamed of owning his own castle built according to the great architecture and art of the buildings he admired during his education in England as well as the palace of the Maharaja of Ramnad in India. His dream came true in 1910 when the majestic Richmond Castle opened its doors—99 of them, to be exact. Sprawled across a 42-acre estate, the castle features intricate carvings, 34 windows embellished with stained glass of exquisite designs, an immense dance hall and staircase of teak especially imported from Burma. The architectural gem is a fusion of different styles from the East and West—tiles from India, window panes from Italy and Scotland, Roman-Dutch style details. The palatial castle was fit for a fairytale, but Don Arthur de Silva needed a princess. When he wed his bride Clarice the couple was welcomed by not just a throng of locals but the Maharaja of Ramnad and the Prince and Princess of Wales. Unfortunately, the marriage did not survive long, for the couple was devastated by their inability to conceive children and separated. Don Arthur de Silva left the Richmond Castle and all his grand possessions to destitute children who needed a shelter, and lived the remainder of his life in a room at the Queen’s Hotel in Kandy. Today the castle, somewhat deteriorated, is owned by the Public Trustee and open to the public to tour its unique architecture and 100-year history. The Richmond Castle is located in Tekkawatta, Palatota in Kalutara South. It’s open for public viewing from 8.30am to 4.30pm on weekdays, except for public holidays such as Poya Days.

Sitting cross-legged, he stares straight ahead over the walkway, his expression empty. At 160 feet tall, he’s one of the tallest sitting Buddha statues in the world. The massive statue has been successful at drawing more locals to the historic temple since it was unveiled in 2007. It’s an eye-catching sight, one you’re sure to notice from a distance. However, the amazing Kande Viharaya has far more to offer than just its signature statue. Since it was founded in 1734, the temple has been an important site for Sri Lankan buddhism. Though it has changed throughout the centuries, thanks to new additions and necessary maintenance, it hasn’t strayed too far from its original basis. As such, the government officially recognizes it as an archaeological site. Step inside the temple and you’ll discover it houses a library, museum, and figures of Sri Lanka’s past kings. You’ll of course find more statues of Buddha, though they’re obviously much smaller than the one that greets visitors. There’s also Bodhi Tree, thought to be more than 300 years old, and a beautiful stone moonstone, a classic feature of architecture first seen in Sri Lanka’s Anuradhapura Kingdom. Go south and take the Colombo to Galle route. When you pass Beruwala, you will spot a Kaluwamodara Bridge, which is about 36 miles away from Colombo. Get on the bridge and turn left at its end.

131,Old Kachcheri,"Jaffna, Sri Lanka",These abandoned ruins in the middle of Jaffna have withstood centuries of tumultuous power struggles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-kachcheri,"Old Park is now a fancy modern park with playgrounds, fast food outlets, and well-curated jogging paths. But tucked away in a corner you’ll find the forgotten ruins of the Old Kachcheri. Vines and plants now look like integral parts of this beautiful example of Neo-Renaissance architecture, and moss adorns the Roman arches wrapping around the central yard. The crumbling roof now invites the elements to destroy the interior rooms. A kachcheri is a district secretariat that functions as a liaison between the central Sri Lanka  government and its activities at district level. Within its own district, a kachcheri also implements government projects, collects revenues, and organizes elections. Expectedly, a bureaucratic branch of the government of this magnitude requires a large facility to accommodate it. Jaffna, being the capital city of the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, is also home of the local kachcheri. Prior to delving into the Old Kachcheri buildings, it’s necessary to become familiar with Jaffna’s tumultuous colonial past. Portugal conquered the island in 1619, and the Dutch eventually took over in 1658. The final twist in the colonial saga occurred in 1796, when the British gained control of all the Dutch possessions in Sri Lanka. It was the British Government Agent Percival Ackland Dyke that bought the 27-acre property and commissioned the building of an administrative center. The administrative center became Jaffna Kachcheri, now known as the Old Kachcheri. History was not always kind to the Old Kachcheri, which went from being targeted by rival armies to being abandoned. The presence of a huge building tailor-made for administrative purposes didn’t escape the attention of the country’s armies. Starting in the late 1970s, the Sri Lanka Army was based at Old Park and made full use of the Old Kachcheri buildings. As the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a militant Tamil organization, seized Jaffna in the late 1980s, they also used Old Park and Old Kachcheri as military and police headquarters. When Sri Lanka regained control of Jaffna in 1995, an army camp was briefly stationed at the kachcheri, but after the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War the building was evacuated and abandoned. Disintegration that began through human agency is now carried out by nature. Vegetation is taking over buildings, and the weather is slowly but surely grinding the building to oblivion. There are rumors that renovation works may begin, but to date nothing has started.Mines still represent a danger in and around the immediate area surrounding Old Kachcheri. De-mining was undertaken, but the property hasn’t been declared mine-free as yet. Caution recommended.",colonialism parks abandoned ruins history

The caves contain larger-than-life statues and elaborate, vibrant paintings of Buddha. Visitors can wander through colonial style outdoor hallways that connect the caves with man-made lily ponds. For more than two millennia, this has been a Buddhist pilgrimage site. The site dates as far back as the first century BC  and is still home to Buddhist monks who manage the property. The temple was carved directly into the rock face in such a way that rainwater never enters the interior caves. The exterior remains a striking white color, despite much of the conservation of the site focusing on the interior murals. Of the five caves, the largest is over 160 feet (50 meters) wide and 65 feet (20 meters) deep. Known as the Cave of the Great Kings, it houses not only statues of Buddha in various poses, but also statues of the gods Vishnu and Saman, as well as Sri Lankan kings of old. Many tourists combine a visit to Dambulla with a trip to Sigiriya as the two are not far apart. Sigiriya, the Lion Rock, can be seen from the Dambulla cave temple complex.

Not only is it the closest authentic living link to Gautama Buddha, it is also the oldest human-planted tree in the world with a known planting date and a recorded history. About 2,600 years ago, Lord Gautama Buddha sat with his back against an Esathu tree on the banks of the Neranjana River in Bodhgaya, India. It was at this moment, as he sat against the tree, that the Buddha is said to have achieved enlightenment. In doing so, the tree also gained a venerated status. It became known as the Bodhi tree, and pilgrims came to see it even within the lifetime of the Buddha. Later, in 236 BC, the Buddhist nun Sanghamitta Maha Theri was sent by the Emperor Asoka from India to Sri Lanka. With her she carried a southern branch of the original sacred fig. This branch was ceremoniously presented to Devanampiya Tissa, one of the earliest kings of Sri Lanka whose reign was notable for the arrival of Buddhism. In 288 BC, Tissa planted the branch of the Bodhi tree in his Royal Park in Anuradhapura. The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, as it became known, has since been cared for and protected by Buddhist monks and dedicated kings. Statues, water canals, golden fences, and walls have been built around the tree over the centuries, and many vows and offerings have been made by Buddhists at the foot of the sacred fig. At times the tree has faced serious threats, and not only from wild elephants. Two storms in 1907 and 1911 resulted in broken branches. A vandal attacked the tree in 1929, hacking off another branch. And then, in 1985, Tamil Tiger separatists stormed the site and massacred 146 Sinhales-Buddhists on the upper terrace. The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, however, remains standing, as revered as ever. And for as long as it continues to thrive, it will remain the oldest cultivated tree in the world with a documented written history.  The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is located within the ancient Mahamewna Gardens, which were created by King Mutasiva (367 - 307 BC). Other attractions inside the gardens include the Samadhi Statue of the Buddha and a handful of stupas.

It consists of about 20 relatively small stupas (the largest is 20 feet in diameter), and they are the burial site of 60 Tamil monks. Coins from the Roman Empire and ancient Chinese Dynasties have been found nearby, but this is not surprising, since Kantharodai is located in the vicinity of what used to be an important port. A site in Tamil Nadu with strikingly similar constructions suggests that cultural exchange between the two regions was rife in antiquity. Furthermore, the two sites show how Buddhism and Megalithism are interwoven. Recent excavations have revealed some evidence that perhaps Tamil Hindus also worshipped these stupas. Not much else is known about this site, which makes it somewhat mysterious. There are rumors that treasures are buried under the stupas, and there seems to be some confusion even about their age. Some claims they are over 2,000 years old, while others insist they’re more recent reconstructions. To add to the mystique, a sign maintains that Buddha himself visited Kantharodai.  Kantharodai is signposted as Kathurugoda Ancient Vihara along the road.

Located in the suburban city of Borella, those buried at the cemetery include soldiers killed in both World War I and World War II. The 48-acre cemetery features sections for the many faiths of Colombo’s diverse international population. Hindus, Buddhists, Shintos, Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and non-denominational Christians all have their own burial sections. There are four crematoriums, and elaborate temples and mausoleums dot the lush landscape. Over the years, there have been numerous reports of paranormal activity at the cemetery. Caretakers have reported seeing ghostly meetings (called “resveem”) at a crossroads where four pathways meet. According to one worker, a group of “rationalists” once attempted to spend the night in the graveyard. They only lasted for a short while, before they were hit with stones thrown from ghostly hands. And there is the tale of a nattily dressed man in a white suit, who lures workers to a mortuary and then disappears into a wall, causing workers to faint and fall. The cemetery’s most famous Western resident is British-born Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who moved to Sri Lanka in 1956, when it was still called Ceylon. An inventor, scuba diver, ecologist, teacher, futurist, and author of science-fiction masterpieces such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, he was also active in Sri Lankan affairs. He served as Chancellor of Moratuwa University, the country’s “most sought after technological college,” from 1979-2002. Clarke was famous for his accurate predictions of numerous technological advances in the 20th century, including the mass production of desktop computers and the rise of online banking and online shopping. He also hosted television shows, including Arthur C. Clarke’s Mysterious World and Arthur C. Clarke’s World of Strange Powers. He died in 2008.

With its interesting architecture and engaging staff, it proudly stands as the first and only planetarium in Sri Lanka. The first thing you’ll notice about the Sri Lanka Planetarium in Colombo is its interesting and strangely familiar architecture. Designed by A. N. S. Kulasinghe, the chief engineer of the State Engineering Corporation of Ceylon, it was built in the shape of a lotus in full bloom. It also borrowed from two famous buildings on different continents: the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral by Sir Frederick Gibberd, and Oscar Niemeyer’s Cathedral of Brasília. Following a much-needed refurbishment in 2014, the planetarium now has 570 seats below its main dome, onto which a new 4D/Digital full dome projector displays the universe in all its glory. You can take a tour of the galaxy, see the night sky as it appears from another country, witness the midnight sun from the Arctic Circle, and marvel at solar eclipses, meteor showers, comets, and various other celestial events. The planetarium also hosts frequent science exhibitions, workshops, and seminars that attract people from across Sri Lanka and beyond. From its very beginnings up until 2015, another stellar attraction at the planetarium was Christie Pillai, who had served as a lecturer from the very beginning. Pillai passed away in 2015 but remains a legend at the Sri Lanka Planetarium. Not only was he a hugely popular, entertaining and knowledgeable member of the planetarium staff, but he was also once the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Astronomical Association set up by science fiction writer Arthur C.

The pool is the only recognizable feature of the palace that has survived the test of time, and it remains remarkably intact and a thing of architectural beauty. The steps used to enter the pool and the channels through which water flowed in out are still visible, as is a remarkably well-preserved urinal, the artistry of which suggests this used to be part of a wealthy palace.

The marsh is home to remarkable bird life, a large population of monitor lizards, numerous species of snakes, and an important cadre of rare fish. All this without leaving the city. Fish species in the marsh and adjoining canal include the endangered Golden Raspbora and Red Barb. As for the birds, expect to see Pelican, Ibis, Purple Coot, Kingfishers, Grebes, and Cormorants as a matter of course, and potentially Red Wattled Lapwing, Ashy Prinia, and Common Babbler. Watch out for the spectacular show put on by fireflies. This unique wildlife corridor also occasionally allows saltwater crocodiles into the heart of the populated area. The marsh is located along the Kinda Canal, one of the water bodies in the Colombo region that were joined together by Dutch engineers in the 18th century to form a series of canals. These canals were plied by flat-bottomed, human-hauled Padda Boats. Today the waterways are maintained for the purposes of drainage, and the authorities are toiling to control the spread of water hyacinth, an invasive species threatening this unique local ecosystem.  Rajagiriya is a suburb on the southeastern border of Colombo, in Sri Lanka’s official administrative capital, Sri Jayawardenapura. To reach the marsh from Rajagiriya, go down Lake Drive to Lake Gardens, past the Royal Park Condominiums, then take the last bridge over the Kinda Canal onto a small island.",waterworks fauna canals wildlife sanctuaries flora fish birds plants animals

Isipathanaramaya is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Colombo, built in 1916 by a wealthy merchant to grieve the loss of his only son, who was executed by the British based on false accusations. The colonial temple’s wonderful architecture and artwork would assure that the young man’s name was remembered throughout the century to come. The bright white domed structure hides a burst of colorful statues and painted murals inside. Created by a renowned artist in the 1920s, the beautiful and well-preserved frescos depict the life of Buddha in a stylized fashion that was quite unique for the time. The temple also houses a lovely Bo Tree, and the recent addition of a 40-foot-tall Buddha statue. Isipathanaramaya is the local temple in Havelock Town (Colombo 5), located just far enough south to be off the tourist track. It’s a serene and peaceful place, a welcome respite from the bustle of Colombo.  Located in Colombo 5, most easily reached by tuk-tuk. Open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with a $1 entry fee. Note that this is an active temple frequented by locals who come here to meditate and pray.",domes buddhism temples sacred spaces history

The city’s size increased and decreased through 30 years of civil war fought by the insurgent group and the Sri Lankan Army. Toward the end of the war in 2008, shortly before the Army regained control and liberated Kilinochchi, an LTTE contingent bombed the water tower that provided water to the whole city. To see it today the size of the fallen tower is daunting, especially so because it now lies on the ground, dwarfing the nearby buildings. The A9 road, which links the North and the South of Sri Lanka, cuts right through Kilinochchi.  The city has by and large recovered from the war, or at least its infrastructure has, but the destroyed water tower remains; in 2014 it was fenced off and turned into a monument, a stark reminder of what the civil war left behind. Traveling in a northbound direction, the water tower is on the righthand side of the road. Given its size, it is all but impossible to miss.",water towers infrastructure war history military
142,Mackwoods Tea Plantation Sign,"Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka",A Sri Lankan tea factory's ironic take on the Los Angeles landmark.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mackwoods-tea-plantation-sign,"If you want to see how tea is grown, picked, and processed, Sri Lanka is the place to go. Many tea plantations in the country offer guided visits, which include walks through the tea fields, tours of the factories, and in many cases, complimentary tea tastings. But the Mackwoods Labookellie Tea Centre tis probably the most famous of the plantations—not because of its tea museum, but because of its ironic take on the Hollywood sign. The massive white letters of the “Mackwoods” sign can be seen for miles around, and the sign is one of the most photographed features in the highland region of Sri Lanka. The Tea Centre, located in the heart of the tea plantation area between Nuwara Eliya and Kandy, is at an elevation of about 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) and, like its counterpart in Los Angeles, the sign is situated high in the hills. Update as of April 2020: A new company has taken over the Mackwoods plantation and replaced the sign with their own logo.  The Mackwoods museum tells much of the plantation's story, but a factory tour, usually available on request, is even more enlightening. The Tea Centre can get very busy during Sri Lankan holiday periods. You can take on a local bus from the bus station in the centre of Nuwara Eliya. There is a bus stop with a ‘Labookellie’ sign above it and a small bus takes you there. Buses are pretty regular and very cheap. If you tell the conductor where you want to get off the bus he will tell you when you get to the right stop. If you decide to travel by train to Nuwara Eliya from Colombo it is only about £5 for a first class (air conditioned) ticket to the nearest station Nanu Oya (about a 15 minute tuc tuc ride from the town centre) but 2nd class is a lot cheaper and the windows open so you get a better view. Even for second class you need to book in advance. Fantastic train journey particulate after you pass Kandy and much of that has a 15mph speed limit so you get plenty of time to take in the views.",signs factories food museums

Many of these items were gifts to the temple. There is also a lot of specifically religious material, including a massive sacred tree in the centre of the complex. Nearby is the temple’s most sacred relic, said to be a lock of the Buddha’s hair donated from a temple in Bengal. The main religious event held here is the Nevam Perahara procession held on the poya day (full moon) every February. Hundreds of monks take part in the procession in which sacred relics are carried in a casket on the back of a highly decorated elephant. After receiving criticism for keeping a captive elephant that was used for religious ceremonies, the temple removed the elephant from public display.  Women should ensure they are appropriately dressed with legs and shoulders covered. Shawls are provided to cover exposed shoulders/legs if needed. Photography is forbidden inside the temple itself. Entrance is 300 rupees. In the region around the Colombo Fort railway station you may be approached by people who seem to be very helpful and offer to take you on a tour to the temple.

144,Kushtarajagala Statue,"Weligama, Sri Lanka",Does this 10-foot-tall statue carved into a rock face depict a king afflicted by a skin condition or a Buddhist figure?,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kushtarajagala-statue,"In Weligama, a beach town on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, there is a 10-foot-tall statue carved into the face of a boulder. Though the exact origin of this sculpture is not known, there are many theories and local stories about where it came from. Some local legends tell a story of a foreign king, while other stories say it was a prince, who suffered from a severe skin disease (kushta in Singhalese). He came to hide in Weligama Bay and was then cured by a local doctor. As a sign of his gratitude, the royal carved a statue of himself and left. (It is argued that if the story is true the king should have carved a statue of the doctor.) Another version of the story talks about how this sick king or prince made an offering to the god Natha, who appears in many forms. Once he was cured, he made a statue of Natha as a gift. These stories were told in ancient times when Weligama was used as a harbor by foreign trading ships, meaning the rock could have been there before they arrived. Archaeologists and historians believe that the statue depicts a Bodhisattva, a person who is destined to reach nirvana. This is due to the presence of four meditating Buddha figures on the headdress and a lotus in the hand. Most maintain that it is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, from Mahayana Buddhism, thought to be the most powerful healers of mankind. This theory is based on two ideas: First, because of the local stories about the king/prince being healed; and second because of similar carvings found in the Wellawaya area called Buduruwagala Raja Maha Viharaya, which is located to the northeast. Details of the statue have led archaeologists to believe that it dates back to the seventh or eighth century. Regardless of any belief, this statue is the only remaining preserved statue in this area and locals still come to worship this statue to request relief from diseases.  Open always.

A fort on the Bay of Galle was established by Portuguese colonizers in 1588, then extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century. The fort resembles a small walled town with streets in a rectangular grid pattern and low houses in the Dutch colonial style. Inside the fort area there are a number of historic churches, mosques, commercial and government buildings. Make sure to try egg and string hoppers for breakfast and visit one of the local beaches in Unawatuna or Welligama.  Since you'll probably be traveling south to Galle from Colombo there are two options: the train with a view of the local villages and the sea or a private driver. I would not recommend renting a car or driving in Sri Lanka as it may be hazardous to your health and peace of mind. Leave the driving to the professionals.",forts colonialism
146,Sambodhi Chaithya,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",This space rocket-like Buddhist stupa sits atop two giant arches and can be seen from out at sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sambodhi-chaithya,"Sambodhi Chaithya is a huge bell-shaped Buddhist stupa in Colombo Harbour, Sri Lanka. Unlike most stupas, it has the distinction of standing on two massive diagonally interlocking arches, allowing the shrine to be seen from out at sea. In 1953, the Most Venerable Henpitagedara Gnanaseeha Thero decided that Colombo should have a Buddhist landmark that could be seen by anyone approaching the Port of Colombo by sea. The renowned Sri Lankan engineer A. N. S. Kulasinghe was chosen to design and build the structure, and construction began in 1956. Kulasinghe’s design was something truly unique. Imagine Cape Canaveral, but with a giant retro Buddhist space rocket about to launch to Alpha Centauri, and you won’t be far off. The white, bell-shaped stupa, or chaitya (a combination of a stupa and a preaching hall), stands on a large platform held aloft on two giant diagonally interlocking arches. The structure rises above the cranes and buildings in the nearby port, clearly visible to anyone out at sea. The entire structure is 261 feet (80 meters) tall. The interlocking arches rise up to a height of 107 feet (33 meters), on which stands the main platform, which is itself a one-story building. On top of this stands the stupa, with a circumference of 158 feet (48 meters). Adding to the space-rocket launchpad effect is the access tower that runs alongside the main structure. Reaching 11 stories high and with 258 steps, the tower is connected to the platform below the stupa via a metal walkway. Once inside, you’ll find yourself beneath the huge dome of the stupa. In the center of the circular floor sits a shrine with four recessed Buddha statues. Along the walls of the dome are a series of 31 murals created by the Venerable Mapalagama Wipulasara Maha Thera (1925-2000), a Theravada Buddhist monk and acclaimed Sri Lankan artist. These murals depict scenes from the life of the Buddha, and Buddhist sites in Sri Lanka. Up on the walls above the murals are four statues at the cardinal points. These figures are the guardian gods of the island and protectors of Buddhism: Viruta, chief of the South; Virupashta, chief of the West; Vaishravana, chief of the North; and Dutharashta, chief of the East.  Sambodhi Chaithya is located at the end of Chaithya Road, past the Colombo Lighthouse. It's open from early in the morning until 6 p.m. Entrance is free. You'll have to take your shoes off when climbing the steps to the stupa and inside the stupa itself. The concrete steps of the access tower can get very hot during the heat of the day, so to avoid scorching your feet it's best to go in the early morning or late afternoon. Once you've finished visiting the stupa, it's worth spending some time exploring the grounds below it. Here you'll find a bo tree planted by former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka Sirimavo Bandaranaike (the world’s first elected female prime minister). Also scattered around the grounds are old cannons, anchors and a vintage steam crane. And just next to Sambodhi Chaithya is the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Maritime Museum.",shrines buddhism towers architectural oddities architecture

One of those stops is at the Patangala Rest House—or now, what’s left of it. The Patangala Rest House house was destroyed during the tsunami that devastated the Sri Lankan coast on Boxing Day, 2004. On December 26th, three large tsunami waves hit the remote beach in the south of Sri Lanka, flooding the middle of the national park where the rest house was located, and killing 47 visitors that were stopped there. The coasts in the east and south of Sri Lanka were heavily struck by the tsunami, killing 30,000 to 35,000 total people in the country. Only the foundation of the rest house remains. In its place there’s a memorial, commemorating the 47 people that were killed on the site—15 Japanese and German tourists, and 29 local visitors, according to the monument’s stone inscription. The sculpture represents the three tsunami waves that struck the area, and the level of water after the tsunami. To get to the memorial you’ll have to be on one of the safaris in the park; otherwise it’s not possible to visit. Most of the safari jeeps will stop at the memorial.

The island of Mannar in Sri Lanka is one of the few spots that can make that claim. The island has a long history of pearl fishing that dates back to at least the second century. Mannar came to be renowned for its pearls, among other resources, and its location on a thriving trade route attracted merchants from Europe and the Middle East. Oral history has it that an Arab merchant brought with him a herd of camels and a supply of baobab fruit as fodder on the shores of Mannar. A seed from this fruit fell on the ground. It took roots and a tree sprouted. More than 700 years later, the tree measures a respectable 7.5 meters (25 feet) in height and an impressive 19.5 meters (64 feet) in circumference. While the tree’s true origin may be impossible to ascertain, there may be a grain of truth to this story. This baobab belongs to the scientific family Bombacaceae, which is native to Africa, and Arab merchants traveled extensively along the East African coast in the 13th century. Baobabs used to be cultivated around Jaffna and Puttlam, but there are only 40 baobabs in the entire country now, 34 of which are found on Mannar Island. Needless to say, this particular specimen in Mannar is the most famous. Because of their grey, gnarled bark, baobabs are often referred to as ali gaha, or elephant trees, by locals. Interestingly, though baobabs are not native to Sri Lanka, they have been declared a protected species. One final curiosity: each baobab fruit contains 30 seeds. Christians in Mannar sometimes refer to this tree as “Judas’ bag” due to the fact that Judas betrayed Jesus in exchange of 30 pieces of silver.  The baobab of Mannar is located 1.2 km northeast of town centre.",world's largest trees world's oldest trees plants
149,Kayman’s Gate Bell Tower,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",A neglected bell tower in modern Colombo is a symbol of the city's colonial past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaymans-gate-bell-tower,"Now largely neglected and overlooked by most passersby, the Kayman’s Gate Bell Tower in the Pettah district is a symbol of Colombo’s colonial history. The free-standing bell tower was built by the Portuguese in 1554 and later served as the site of public hangings. During Colombo’s Portuguese era, Kayman’s Gate served as the east entrance to Colombo Fort, built to protect colonial trading interests in the city. When needed, a drawbridge was lowered from the gate, connecting the fort with the outskirts of the city. Outside the gate lay St. John’s River, in reality, a canal connected to Beira Lake, into which much of the fort’s waste was dumped. This attracted the lake’s crocodiles, who swam up the canal to feed on the waste. When the fort was captured by the Dutch in 1656, Colombo’s new colonial overlords named the east entrance Kayman’s Gate after the crocodiles (kaaiman in Dutch) that swam in the canal. During the Dutch period, the Kayman’s Gate bell tower was rebuilt and a new bell hung from the belfry. The bell likely came from a church in the Royal Kingdom of Kotte in Sri Lanka, abandoned in 1565 and later occupied by the Dutch. When the Dutch found the bell in the ruins of a church, they took it to Colombo and hung it in the new bell tower. The bell, which still hangs in the tower today, is inscribed with “Ave gratia plena dominus tecum benadicta tu in mulieribus,” or “Hail full of grace the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women.” During the Dutch period, the bell was used to sound out the closing of the fort gates and to announce the nightly curfew. Colombo was captured by the British in 1796, who took Pettah after breaching Kayman’s Gate. Under British occupation, the fort was all but leveled. Its walls, barricades, canals, and moats were demolished or filled in. Kayman’s Gate was demolished too, but the bell tower was kept in place to call the congregation to services at Wolvendaal Church. It was also used as the site of a far darker practice: up until the late 19th Century, the immediate area on which the bell tower now stands was used for public hangings.  Kayman’s Gate Bell Tower is located near a busy street corner at the intersection of Main and 4th Cross Street, in a ramshackle and often chaotic part of Pettah. Tucked away behind street stalls and a wire fence, and back-dropped by a bare concrete wall, it would be easy to miss if you didn't know of its existence. It's also largely neglected, and barely registers as a tourist attraction. That said, it remains an intriguing symbol of Colombo's colonial past and its history of foreign occupiers.",
150,Sea Tigers Submarine Yard,"Puthukkudiyiruppu, Sri Lanka",Remains of military submarines built in secret jungle factories by the Tamil guerrillas' naval wing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sea-tigers-submarine-yard,"These submarines wouldn’t be out of place in a 1950s sci-fi flick, but in fact, they are warzone remnants of the long and bloody Sri Lankan Civil War. These deserted vessels were homemade in secret in makeshift factories in Tamil Tiger-occupied territory by the rebels’ naval wing. The Mullaitivu district on Sri Lanka’s northeastern coast was the site of the naval base of the LTTE, Liberation Tigers Tamil Eelam, aka Tamil Tigers. The harbor here served as the headquarters of the so-called Sea Tigers, the formidable naval wing of the insurgent operation. Among their various ambitious activities, the Sea Tigers engineers built a number of submarines. In 2009, as Sri Lankan government troops were advancing deeper into Tiger-held northern territory shortly before the end of the war, troops made a startling and key discovery. They stumbled on a deserted submarine boatyard near Puthukkudiyiruppu in the country’s Mullaitivu district, where Sea Tigers were manufacturing secret underwater vessels. As the Tigers retreated further into the jungle during the government’s final push against the LTTE,  the rebels left ghost camps behind, including this crude submarine workshop. In the boatyard, the Sri Lankan Army discovered four submersibles and semisubmersibles. (Finding true submarines was rare, as they very difficult to build.) This included three terrorist suicide boats in mid-construction and unused, a crudely built mini-sub, and an unfinished steel hull of a larger submarine. What the larger one was supposed to be used for, however, is unknown. As the LTTE grew from a guerrilla movement to more sophisticated they built up a strategically vital naval wing, the Sea Tigers, which constructed, in secret in the jungle in Tiger territory, a range of novel, experimental vessels. They made up for their lack of open ocean capability with innovative boats like explosive suicide vessels and crude submarines. Some of the unconventional designs were ineffective but others were substantial. Others are so unusual it’s unclear how they were planned to be used, and there is ongoing research attempts to make sense of the Sea Tiger’s homemade fleet.",submarines war history military

The eerie streets of this abandoned beachside paradise still echo with the cries of surfers fighting against the strong coastal waves from the village’s bygone days as a hub of midcentury futurism. The Futuro houses, designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, resemble whimsical flying saucers. The pre-fabricated plastic oddities were originally designed as ski chalets light enough to be airlifted onto any terrain, although the ones at Wanli swapped the adjustable UFO-style legs for tacky ’70s-era pebble-concrete staircases. The UFO-shaped house closest to the entrance of the park boasts a fully functioning airplane-style door and windows; inside the small circular space are a sitting area, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. (Other Futuros farther into the park have been less well-preserved, although one nearly hidden example seems to be in continuous occupation as part of a much larger building.) This particular pod, comprising about six Futuros, is scattered throughout a large complex of Venturo Houses, another retrofuturistic pre-fab house model by the same architect. Unlike the Futuro, the Venturo never really took off in its own era, and hasn’t experienced the same resurgence of popular interest. Reportedly less than 10 “true” Venturos exist in the world—but there are more than 10 in this park alone! That’s where the mystery comes in: These dwellings do not appear to have been sanctioned by Suuronen himself, and there doesn’t seem to be any publicly accessible information as to where they came from, or even exactly when they were built.",ufos science fiction design houses homes abandoned architectural oddities architecture

During its height, Houtong encompassed around 900 households, fostering a population of around 6,000 people. Yet by the 1970s the town’s fortunes began to fall into decline. As is often the case in such situations, the younger residents of the town quickly began leaving for greener pastures and opportunities in the bigger cities. By the 1990s, the mining industry had died off in the area completely, and the population of the village had dwindled to less than 100 people. Most villages in this situation would have simply fallen off the face of the Earth, but luckily for Houtong, it received a little feline salvation. By 2008, the tiny village had accumulated dozens of stray cats that nearly outnumbered the humans. Seeing this as an opportunity to inject a little life into their town, the human inhabitants began advertising themselves on the internet as a cat-friendly sanctuary, where visitors could come and commiserate with the meowing mousers that had control of the streets. The image stuck, and today Houtong is a fairly popular tourist destination that sees people train in from all over to see the cats (now numbering over 100) that freely roam the area.

Built by Italian artist Narcissus Quagliata, the Dome of Light also commemorates the harrowing birth of Taiwan’s democracy. Despite its location at Kaohsiung’s busiest metro stop, the Dome of Light holds the solemnity of a cathedral. The dome is an impressive 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter and is made of 4,500 glass panels, making it the largest work of glass art in the world. The installation took Quagliata four and a half years to complete and has led some to call Formosa Boulevard one of the world’s most beautiful subway stations. Each of the dome’s four quadrants highlights themes from the lifecycle of the cosmos, humanity, and Taiwan’s own tumultuous political history. The imagery moves through periods of painful growth and inevitable destruction, but the overall message echoes with hope and rebirth. Although Taiwan is now considered one of the most legitimate democracies in Asia (second only to Japan and South Korea), its political history is defined by violence and oppression under a one-party state. Beginning with the February 28 massacre in 1947, a 38-year period of martial law saw tens of thousands of political dissidents imprisoned or executed. Things began to shift on December 10, 1979, when a pro-democracy demonstration and celebration of Human Rights Day descended into police-instigated violence. The events of the protest helped unite government opposition and marked a turning point in Taiwan’s democratization. Known as the Formosa Incident, the protests took place near the present-day Formosa Boulevard Station where the Dome of Light is installed. At street level, the Formosa Boulevard Station is just as remarkable. The four main entrances were designed by Japanese architect Shin Takamatsu. Their curved shape and orientation towards one another is thought to be symbolic of hands clasped in prayer—perhaps seeking redemption for the past or wishing for continued peace in the future. The Dome of Light can be found in the B1 level of the Formosa Boulevard Station, where the Kaohsiung MRT Red Line and Orange Line intersect.",politics trains transportation art

Once the land of the indigenous Truko people, in whose language Taroko means “magnificent and beautiful,” the land was recreated as a national park by the Taiwanese government in 1986. Driven out by the Japanese in 1914, today the only remains of the Truko people in Taroko National park are the ruins of the 120-year-old Tupido Tribe Trail on the Tianhsyang mesa. The picturesque Eternal Spring Shrine has been rebuilt twice following landslides, and remembers the 212 who died during the construction of the Central Cross-Island Highway. The Tunnel of Nine Turns follows a particularly dramatic series of tight turns along the narrow gorge. Another long, unlit tunnel known as the Baiyang Waterfall Trail allows hikers willing to brave the dark some extraordinary views of sheet waterfalls at the far end. An annual international marathon is run at Taroko National Park each year in November.",natural wonders nature

Named after the waterfall that runs beneath it year round, the beautiful little temple was built in the late 1950s while the nearby Cross-Island Highway was still under construction. The road was built by Taiwanese veterans and tragically over 200 of them perished during the effort. These brave workers are remembered by a small temple and adjoining pavilion that are connected by the bridge spanning the titular falls, all of which makes up the shrine complex. Visitors to the shrine who are willing to do a little exploring will find a number of wonders hidden behind the shrine as well including a cave with statues of a handful of Taoist gods, and trails leading to more secluded towers and sites hidden among the natural features. The shrine has been damaged and nearly destroyed a couple of times due to landslides on its verdant mountainside, but each time, the site has been rebuilt and continues to stand as a beautiful monument to the human cost of progress.

Stabbing out into the East China Sea, the thin spit of land now known as a “geopark” is awash in all manner of sculpted rock formations. The most well-known shapes are the top-heavy hoodoos that act as the symbol of the park, but there are a wide variety of shapes that have been etched into the land across the centuries. The unique landscape is the result of wind and waves crashing over the thin spike of earth, coming from the sea on almost every side. Many of these natural stone forms have even been given fanciful pet names like the oft-photographed, “Queen’s Head.” In the park you can also find formations called the “The Fairy Shoe,” and “The Sea Candles.” In addition the to the stunning geological wonders in the geopark, the other increasingly common sight are the throngs of tourists that have begun flocking to the site. Unfortunately, like the wind and water that shaped the bulbous vistas, the very presence of so many humans is beginning to shape the land as well. Popular sites like the “Queen’s Head” have become so overrun that bright lines have been painted on the ground to keep anyone from disturbing the delicate rocks. The rocks took centuries to form, but could be forever changed in an instant, with our interference.",rocks geological oddities geology

Essentially acting as a giant pendulum, the enormous steel sphere moves slightly back and forth to counter any motion of the building itself. It is an engineering marvel meant to limit the vibrations of the 1,667-foot tall building. The 18-foot diameter, 660- metric ton steel sphere is suspended by eight cables in the upper stories of the tower, and is visible between the 88th and 92nd floors. The Taipei 101 Tuned Mass Damping were built and tested by A&H Custom Machine. The fabrication of the components took approximately a year to complete. As one of the tallest structures in the world, located only 660 feet from a major fault line, earthquakes and high winds are a serious threat. In fact, visitors even caught a glimpse of the tuned mass damper in action during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Many skyscrapers contain tuned mass dampers to restrain sway, and as the tops of the tallest buildings can move several feet in the wind, a tuned mass damper or similar mechanism is often necessary for maintaining structural integrity. At Taipei 101, the room-sized device is capable of moving five feet in any direction, thereby reducing sway by 30 to 40 percent. Safety comes at a hefty price, however, as the tower’s tuned mass damper cost $4 million to build.

Located in the southwest of Lotus Lake and completed in 1953 just two years after the man-made lake itself, the Spring and Autumn Pavilions are a pair of traditionally ornate palace towers that are separated by large dragon being ridden by a god. The two massive pavilions are dedicated to a God of War, known (among many other spellings) as Kuan Kung. The two devotional buildings are separated by a giant dragon statue that itself has the statue of a large figure on its back. This was inspired by the tale of the Goddess of Mercy, Kuanyin, riding a dragon through the sky, symbolically separating Spring and Autumn. Visitors can enter the pavilions through the dragon’s mouth. A ways south of the pavilions along the lakeshore are the much taller Dragon and Tiger Pagodas which were completed in 1978. This twin-spired temple consists of a duo of seven-story pagoda towers which are attended by giant versions of their respective beast. The interior of the towers are decked out in traditional finery with two spiral staircases each, one for ascending devotees and one for those descending. Both the giant dragon and the giant tiger have their mouths open and visitors enter the temple spaces by being devoured.

In actuality this strange building is a church meant to cater to women. Or to reference a local legend. Or something. Finished in early 2016, the giant shoe church is an all-glass structure, formed out of 320 blue-tinted panes, set into a metal grid. The main worship space is held in the toe with a large screen at the tip, while there is an outdoor stage built into the collar where someone’s giant foot might go. While it is being called a church, officials say that its main function will be to cater to weddings and photo shoots. In addition to its questionably female-centric architecture, the interior of the worship shoe is said to include over 100 features that women will like, including love seat benches, biscuits and cakes, and maple leaf decorations. Before anyone gets to thinking that all of this is just to pander to women, there is a second, more traditional  reasoning behind the design of the church. Apparently it is actually an allusion to a local story of a girl who caught Blackfoot. As the story goes, this local girl contracted the disease and had to have the lower portions of her legs amputated, ending her engagement, and resulting in her spending the rest of her days alone and living in a church.

Whether the high heel shoe church is meant to be an outdated clarion call to women, via their stereotypical love of shoes, or a huge monument to a tragic tale, it is certainly something to behold.",churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture

163,Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village,"Yuchi Township, Taiwan",This attraction is part anthropological journey and part amusement park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/formosan-aboriginal-culture-village,"Since the 1980s, Taiwan’s Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village has been educating visitors about the history and customs of the country’s Indigenous tribes. But even more recently the park has branched out into teaching guests about how awesome roller coasters can be. Originally built in 1986, the culture park stands as Taiwan’s largest outdoor museum, consisting of nine separate village reconstructions and a traditional European garden. Each of the villages was meant to represent a different tribal culture from the area and were created based on ethnographic illustrations from the early 20th century. In addition to the traditional architectural flourishes throughout the park, traditional dances, crafts, and other authentic demonstrations are regularly performed. Notably, all of the performers in the park are Indigenous people. The Taiwanese government currently recognizes 16 aboriginal tribes. Years of conflict and colonization have greatly reduced the country’s Indigenous population and culture–out of 26 known Formosan languages, 10 have been declared extinct, while the remaining languages are in danger of disappearing completely. Lest the exploration of a rich and varied culture that may soon fade from memory in the coming century become a bit stale or boring for younger visitors, a new section of the park was built in 1992, called Amusement Isle. Maintaining the cultural flavor of the more educational portions of the park, the exciting new isle contains a collection of roller coasters and adrenaline engines including Taiwan’s tallest free-fall drop ride. Whether you are coming to the park to see the blooming of the cherry blossom trees and learn some of the aboriginal weaving techniques, or if you simply want to scream while the wind whips through your hair on the Mayan Adventure Roller Coaster, the Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village, oddly enough, will not disappoint.",amusement parks indigenous colonialism parks

Nowadays, the place has taken on a new purpose altogether, thanks to the spectacle of the Anping Tree House that is tucked around the back. For a few dollars, you can enter the grounds and find the remains of the warehouse buildings crumbling under an extraordinary web of banyan tree roots. In the years since the site was abandoned, the living banyan tree has forced its way through, over, and across the brickwork and concrete. Remarkably, the sprawling roots and branches have excellently preserved the shape of walls, doorways, and roofs that have long since fallen down and been removed. An elevated walkway has been added to the grounds, which allows visitors to navigate the rooms of the Anping Tree House, as it has been dubbed, without too much interruption from the tangled tree roots that hang everywhere.

Only a small, nondescript sign hanging above its short entrance hints at its significant history. The tunnel was built by the Japanese in 1903 (Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945) and is now referred to as the “100-Year Bomb Shelter.” This portal into the city’s underbelly was a refuge for those seeking shelter from the bombs dropped by American forces during World War II. In addition to acting as a long, narrow bomb shelter, the tunnel was also used as an ammunition depot. Now, it serves a far less risky purpose. As it’s concealed within a bustling area, locals have begun using it as an underground shortcut while going to-and-fro. It lets them enter the hillside from one neighborhood and pop out in another, without having to deal with any crowds.

167,Grand Matsu Temple,"Tainan City, Taiwan",Only through deep darkness and tragedy did this elaborate royal palace become a sacred temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grand-matsu-temple,"The goddess Matsu ranks among one of the most important deities in Taiwan, thanks to the protection she offered during the perilous journey from the mainland to Taiwan. An estimated 4-500 temples exist in Taiwan devoted to Matsu alone, yet one of the most sacred of all sits in downtown Tainan City. Inside the Grand Matsu Temple, rooms upon rooms contain shrines to various deities, especially in back of the main hall. The most prominent of all is a large golden one in the middle representing Matsu herself. Two tall monster-like statues on either side represent Matsu’s servants, Qianli Yuan and Xufong Er. Legend has it that these two creatures were monsters that Matsu subdued and converted to do good, helping her to patrol the seas and help sailors. Visitors and devotees wandering the main hall could peruse the wide variety of deities on display without detecting a single trace of the tragedy and darkness that once transpired inside these very walls, when the holy temple had been a princely palace. For, in the years before Grand Matsu Temple became one of the most sacred temples in the country, it had been a royal palace. Zheng Chenggong’s son, Zheng Jing, commissioned the building in 1664 for the Prince of Ningjing after inviting the young Ming princeling to take up residency in Taiwan, having no idea the dark turn of events about to befall all who resided there. It was here, in the palace-slash-proto-temple, that the prince decided to take his own life. Following suit, in the main hall of the building where the giant gilded Matsu reigns today, the prince’s five concubines hanged themselves from a wood beam. Only later, after the Qing took over Taiwan and General Shi Lang took up residency in the palace, did he petition his emperor to have the building converted into a temple dedicated to Matsu, making the Grand Matsu Temple of Tainan the country’s first officially dedicated Matsu temple in Taiwan. And only those who know the dark history behind the place know why.  The temple is located in the Chikan Lou Cultural Zone, but it’s not easily visible. It’s tucked behind some buildings that run along the south side of Minzu Road between Yongfu and Ximen.",suicide shrines temples death

Every word, every character needed to be on stock for printing. And here, in the middle of Taipei, these characters are still produced with molten lead. Rixing Type Foundry is the last Chinese character type manufacturer in Taiwan. This rare typographic gem manufactures and sells traditional Chinese movable type character, and may well be the last Chinese type foundry in the world.

There, two ordinary red and green mailboxes were hit by a wind-blown billboard during the storm. They managed to survive the attack, though they now lean at a wonky angle.

People staged photoshoots pretending to heave the crooked boxes back upright or act as though they’ll be crushed beneath them. Locals even named the beloved mailboxes “Little Red” and “Little Green.” After realizing how popular they were with the public, the Taiwanese National Mail decided not to replace them and instead left them as is. Incredibly, the mailboxes still accept letters. Anything that goes through these unusual mailboxes even gets marked with a special stamp.

Instead of the usual lion-dog statues that preface more traditional temples, dragon head turtles are the guardians of the choice here.

Taiwan is a place that embraces polytheism, and it’s quite common to see a multitude of deities housed peacefully in the same space. While there are over 15,000 temples spread across the island, this nautical sea shrine has a unique sense of quirkiness. Built in 1996, it took two years to complete the entire structure. The entrance is adorned with a long row of shell-beaded chandeliers, and the main attraction is a narrow five-foot-tall tunnel packed with bright white coral on all sides. Even the incense burners are graced with a thick layer of shell and coral stubs. There is a caveat though. With reef systems being decimated around the globe, the temple has drawn some controversy among conservationists. The environmental repercussions of this coral-jeweled pantheon is questionable, though staff have said that the corals are not of the endangered sort.  There’s no public transportation available.

Traditionally fish balls are made of a fish paste mixed together with vegetables and spice which is then rolled into a ball and steamed or fried. The origins of the popular junk food can be traced back to overabundant fish catches that left fishermen with a bunch of meat they didn’t know what to do with, eventually grinding it all up and using the paste to create things like fish balls and fish crisps. The Teng feng Fish Ball company was started back in 1940 when a couple of war buddies began producing fish crisps around the same time that plastic bag technology was beginning to hit its stride, allowing their product to take advantage of the sealed containers. From there they began to expand into fish balls and are now a successful producer of fish paste products. Deciding to give back to the industry that brought them such success, the Tengfeng Fish Ball Museum was opened. Today the museum features displays on the production and environmental impact of creating their products, leading visitors through the various species of fish that contribute to their fish balls. There are also a number of pieces of production equipment on display as well as the opportunity to roll your own balls by hand.",food museums food museums
176,Yanshui Beehive Fireworks Festival,"Tainan City, Taiwan",A festival where people vie to be bombarded by exploding clusters of fireworks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yanshui-beehive-fireworks-festival,"While much of Asia believes red decorations or sky lanterns can bring good luck in the new year, locals in the Yanshui district of Tainan believe that the more times you’re hit by a rocket, the better. Fifteen days into the Chinese lunar calendar, on the evening of the Lantern Festival, the district launches millions of fireworks directly into eager crowds. Thousands don motorcycle helmets and protective gear, take a swig or two of liquid courage, and take to the streets for a chance to be battered by explosions. At this festival, nearly catching fire is considered a good thing. The festival begins with a parade of palanquins, each carrying a holy figurine. Giant cylinders known as beehives are stuffed with bottle rockets and placed every couple of yards along the parade route. As the parade inches through town, crowds rush to huddle around the beehives. Sirens wail to warn anyone with second thoughts, and then the hives are lit. Within moments, trails of light scream in all directions like a swarm of angry bees bursting from a nest. Flaming cardboard rolls ricochet off helmets, leave bruises, and explode at random inside the crowd. People will throw down their own rockets from apartment balconies above, contributing to the mayhem below. The blast lasts only a minute or two before culminating in a dazzling skyward fireworks display. The origins of this strange custom date back to the late 1800s, when a cholera epidemic ravaged the town for more than 20 years. The locals asked the Chinese god of war, Guan Gong, to ward off the disease. On the day of the Lantern Festival, firecrackers were set off along the road in the hopes of inviting Guan Gong to the village. The epidemic subsided, but the tradition continued—and grew. Today, one beehive can hold anywhere from 10,000 to several hundred thousand rockets. These can cost up to $2,000 to construct but the luck they bring is worth the cost. Far from being just a burn threat, a rocket trapped inside a helmet can cause temporary hearing loss or permanent blindness. Nevertheless, people from all across Taiwan continue to travel to Yanshui for a shot at some luck of their own.  The Yanshui Beehive Fireworks Festival occurs 15 days into the Chinese lunar calendar each year. It can be disorienting for outsiders, and public transport from Tainan City to Yanshui district is complicated. For the best possible experience, try to attend with someone who is a festival veteran. In addition, visitors who would like to come away with functioning sensory organs should plan to wear flame retardant clothes, a scarf, gloves, and a full face motorcycle helmet.",chinese new year fireworks parades explosions fires festivals

So his wife Soong Mei-ling commissioned the Grand Hotel—a stunning 12-story building and one of the finest classical Chinese buildings in the world. Established in 1952, the hotel became a Taiwanese landmark with its gilded tiles and red vermilion columns. Standing at 87 meters (285 feet), it was the tallest building in Taiwan for a number of years. In 1995, a fire broke out and destroyed most of the roof and the upper floors. During the repair process, workers discovered a hidden feature tucked underneath the hotel—a two-prong tunnel system complemented with a 229-foot-long escape slide for those with disablities. There were also bomb-proof light bulbs to light the way. Built to accommodate up to 10,000 people, the tunnels are air-raid shelters that lead out to nearby parks, intended for government officials and important heads of state to escape during the event of war. Tight, claustrophobic, and meant to only accommodate one person at a time, the slide was at one point considered the longest in the world. For years, the tunnels have been largely closed to the public—save for an occasional private tour or two—but the hotel recently opened them up for guided tours. There are four time slots per day, and the tour itinerary takes guests through the tunnel as well as to the former residence of the hotel’s first general manager.  Reservations have to be made ahead of time; there are four showings a day, at 9:30 a.m., 11 a.m., 2:30 p.m., and 4 p.m. The tour is only in Chinese, so plan for a translator if necessary.",escape routes bunkers tunnels hotels architecture
179,Luoshan Organic Tofu Farm,"Fuli Township, Taiwan",Learn to make this village's specialty: volcanic mud tofu.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/luoshan-organic-tofu-farm,"Tucked in the hills of one of Taiwan’s first organic farming villages, Luoshan Organic Tofu Farm gives visitors the chance to try making tofu from scratch. But there’s a secret ingredient: volcanic mud water. Contrary to how it might sound, volcanic mud pits are nothing like their magma-spewing counterparts. The pits form as gases such as methane and carbon dioxide push hot water and minerals out of the ground. The water that comes out is a natural source of magnesium chloride, which helps coagulate soy milk into tofu. These mud pools are scattered all around Luoshan, including one available for public viewing. There’s a trail to it from Luoshan Organic Tofu Farm, and it’s about a 10-minute walk. The family that owns Luoshan Organic Tofu Farm guides visitors through the process from soybean to volcanic mud tofu: grinding the soybean into milk, cooking it, coagulating it, and pressing it. Proprietor Lin Yih-Cheng converted the space from a bed and breakfast into a workshop in the early 1990s. While there are many tofu-adjacent businesses in the area, Lin’s is the most popular, so reservations are a must. The class is conducted in a cool and shaded outdoor annex of his home, surrounded by trees. After decades of leading classes, Lin leads many workshops and provides animated and detailed explanations on the coagulation process and stories about the surrounding village and town. There’s also a small plot behind the workshop where the family grows their own Taiwanese soybeans. The entire class takes about an hour, and attendees are free to eat what they make. The finished tofu is dressed with a kiss of wasabi and some sweet soy paste, and served with a side of warm, fresh soy milk. The family also has a small gift shop featuring homemade hot sauce, tofu pudding, and fermented tofu curds. Everything but volcanic mud tofu, unfortunately. It doesn’t travel well, so get your fill before you go.  Take the train to Fuli township and grab a taxi. It’s about a 20-minute-ride to the workshop and all the local cab drivers know where it is. The minimum group size for the class is four. Visit their Facebook page for contact information or email bignature58@gmail.com. The workshop is conducted entirely in Chinese, so a translator might be necessary. Reservations are required.",tofu mud volcanoes farms food
180,The Imperial Japanese Navy Fengshan Wireless Communications Station,"Fengshan District, Taiwan",This former military installation was turned into a discipline center by the Taiwanese Navy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-imperial-japanese-navy-fengshan-wireless-communications-station,"This site in Kaohsiung City’s Fengshan district had multiple masters. It was initially built by the Japanese Navy between 1917 and 1919 as one of three large-scale wireless telecommunication centers in the Pacific. It remained under Japanese control until the end of World War II, when Taiwan was reunited with the Republic of China. For much of the postwar period, the base was used as a detention facility referred to by some as “Fengshan Guest House.” Upon entering you can see a rectangular building that was first used as an office building, then converted into meeting and interrogation rooms. The Cruciform station, a smaller structure a few steps south, was used for telecommunications. There you can still find (non-functioning) mechanical and electrical equipment as well as air conditioning trenches. Access to the building is unrestricted, but visitors should be cautious as not all areas are safe. The site’s centerpiece is the main blockhouse. The building is fortified and looks more like a bunker than a functional building from the outside, with blast-resistant doors and windows and deep soil on the roof to protect from bombing by the Allied forces. During the Japanese use of the facilities, this building housed the main communication equipment, and was designated as the First Sending Telecommunication Station. During the Fengshan Guest House period, prisoners allegedly called it “the cave,” in reference to its size and the way it was built into a hill. In 2011, the former communications station and detention center was opened to the public. Taiwan’s Council for Cultural Affairs lists it as a national monument, and there is a small welcoming hut at the entrance.  The station is open from Tuesday to Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. There is no entrance fee, but visitors may be asked to sign a guestbook.",prisons war history world war ii military
181,Treasure Hill,"Taipei City, Taiwan",This densely-packed cluster of buildings was saved from the wrecking ball and turned into an art community.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/treasure-hill-taipei,"On a hill in the middle of Taipei, near the Xindian River, there is a cluster of buildings so densely packed that it resembles a real-life version of the urban sprawl in Hayao Miyazaki’s Howl’s Moving Castle. Known as Treasure Hill, the cluster was once to be an illegal shantytown that housed over 200 military families in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, it is a community filled with art and artists. Because the buildings were so haphazardly constructed, it was met with a lot of opposition by the local city government, who wanted to demolish the entire thing and turn it into a park. Saving Treasure Hill was a controversial ask, but eventually a compromise was reached: the community was renovated and turned into an artist village. Today, Treasure Hill is an incubator for both international and local art. Only about two dozen families still reside in the area, while the rest of it has been converted into artist spaces with a handful of studios, residency programs, and a hostel. Fortunately, the town still proudly retains much of the original chaos that made it so charming. With winding alleyways and vegetation growing out the cracks, it’s a quaint place to just stroll around. There are large fortune-cookie statues in the open spaces, elaborate wall murals, boutique shops, and a handful of coffee shops to linger around in.  The closest MRT stop is Gongguan station, and it’s about a 10 minute walk from there.",artists art outside villages urban planning art

In addition to a large seated statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, whose military guard is changed hourly, the hall features exhibits from the founding father’s life, a world-class performance hall, and elegant exhibition center with an area of around 10,000 square feet. It hosts art, film, and music performances and is sited in Chung-shan Square Park. Doctor Sun Yat-sen, born in 1866 into a Chinese peasant family in Kwangtung, China near the Portuguese colony of Macao, was educated as a medical doctor in Hawaii, Canton, China and Hong Kong. As the leader of China’s republican revolution he did much to inspire and organize the movement that overthrew the Manchu dynasty in 1911—a family of rulers that had reigned over China for nearly three hundred years. On January 1, 1912, Sun Yat-sen proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of China. A bitter power struggle in 1913 forced Sun Yat-sen to flee China to Japan. In 1916 he returned to Shanghai and reorganized his party, this time as the Chinese Kuomintang. He published several manifestos outlining his vision of the Chinese republic, and his political fortunes waxed and waned through several years of civil wars. Sun Yat-sen died in 1925 in Peking, China and was given a state funeral. His leadership position in the Kuomintang was eventually taken by his former military aide, General Chiang Kai-shek, who in 1949 fled to Taiwan after losing mainland China to the Chinese Communist Party led by Mao Zedong. Chiang Kai-shek led the Kuomintang in Taiwan until his death in 1975, and before his funeral his body laid in state in the newly-constructed Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.

183,'Shoaf Kepl Poets',"Tainan City, Taiwan",A plaque by the roadside describes a three-dimensional glossary of an imagined language where words are numbers and numbers are words.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shoaf-kepl-poets,"At this site in Baihe, Taiwan, a stone marker tells the story of an unusual language where words and numbers swap roles. But it’s not a language local to the region—it hails from a fictional parallel universe known as Kcymaerxthaere. Kcymaerxthaere is an art project that has been in progress since 2003.  Created by the artist Eames Demetrios, the project comprises a series of plaques and other markers around the world honoring events that have taken place in a parallel universe. According to Demetrios, this universe “co-exists to some degree with ours.” Most of the installations are bronze or stone plaques inscribed with stories but some are larger, even entire buildings. As of 2021, there are more than 140 sites spread across six continents and 30 countries. The Shóaf Kepl Poets installation offers a kind of interactive dictionary which allows you to decipher the inscription on the white marble—the story there and the experience of uncovering it, also gives you insight into the languages known as 158s, where words are numbers and numbers are words. When most people first hear about these cultures, they assume that we are talking about the symbols of the numbers. And while those do have meaning , the remarkable thing was that the meaning was in the number itself. So, for example, the idea of 26 could translate as “the feeling of being about to solve a puzzle or problem.” If someone were to drop 26 carrots on the ground, it would be equivalent to seeing the phrase “the feeling of being about to solve a problem” written on the ground. According to the project’s lore, this fictional culture developed an almost preternatural ability to count. As result, they saw patterns and phrases and ideas everywhere. Looking at a beach covered in multicolored stones was like reading a novel where the words are constantly changing meaning. On one of the stones is carved a mystery solvable only be reading the glossary slabs between the two big stones. But you will learn about a pattern scientist neared Terrat Slemt Surphell–so well worth it.

184,Kaohsiung National Stadium,"Kaohsiung City, Taiwan",This dragon-shaped sports arena is the world’s largest solar-powered stadium.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaohsiung-national-stadium,"The National Stadium in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, was designed and built as the main venue for the 2009 World Championship Games. As well as being the highest capacity stadium in Taiwan, it’s also the world’s largest solar-powered stadium. Formerly known as the World Games Stadium, the stadium was designed by the acclaimed Japanese architect Toyo Ito. With a capacity of 55,000, it’s the largest stadium in Taiwan and is today mainly used for soccer matches. Ito, who also designed the Nipro Hachiko Dome in Japan, is known for his innovative designs and conceptual architecture. The National Stadium certainly continues that trend. Visually, the stadium looks like a curled dragon or snake resting on the landscape, with a large gap between its head and tail that serves as the entrance to the arena. And those scales are not scales at all: They are large solar panels. The roof of the stadium is covered with 8,844 solar panels, making it the first stadium in the world that runs completely on its own energy. It’s also the largest photovoltaic system in Taiwan, capable of supplying 1.14GWh of electricity annually. The energy generated is more than enough to power the stadium’s 3,300 lights and two jumbo vision screens. On days when the stadium isn’t being used, the Taiwanese government can feed the extra energy into the local grid, providing almost 80 percent of the local area’s energy requirements. Other innovative features of the National Stadium—which was built using 100 percent recyclable raw materials—include attention to Feng Shui coupled with computer simulations. With help from the Central Weather Bureau, the stadium was designed with the summer wind direction in mind, allowing air to circulate freely to maximize natural cooling. The roof of the stadium was also carefully orientated to protect spectators from the fierce summer sun of Kaohsiung. It can also collect rainwater for use inside the stadium, with a system of pipes carrying water to underground tanks. Surrounding the stadium, meanwhile, are nearly seven hectares of public green spaces, including a park with tropical plants, bicycle paths, sports parks, and an ecological pond.  The National Stadium is located in the Zuoying District of Kaohsiung, a coastal city in southern Taiwan. Bus stops are located along Shiyun Boulevard and Junxiao Road, which border the stadium to the south and west respectively.

The skywalk passes over botanical gardens, a military cemetery, old Japanese barracks, a baseball field, and a local high school. During the right time of year, walkers are treated to a medley of colorful flowers and butterflies, and parts of the skywalk are often decorated to celebrate holidays and other events. The skywalk is a popular walking trail for locals looking for some early morning or late afternoon relaxation and exercise. There are placards along the trail with information in Mandarin and English about the flora, fauna, and landmarks one might encounter along the way. It’s an easy and accessible walk, but the entrance at the eastern side of the Great Buddha Temple can be tricky to find, and the entrance on Guashan Road is not accessible to those with mobility issues.  The entrance is on the eastern side of the temple, towards the back. There are usually market stalls in the area and the friendly locals will be happy to show you where to go.",trails design nature
186,Jadeite Cabbage With Insects,"Taipei City, Taiwan",An imperial art museum offers edible versions of its most treasured displays in an on-site fine-dining restaurant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jade-cabbage,"Taiwan’s National Palace Museum is stocked with breathtaking treasures from China’s imperial. Its arguably greatest attraction is a small statuette, shaped like a bok choy cabbage. While it may seem pedestrian at a glance, a closer look reveals that the cabbage is actually carved from a single piece of green-and-white jade, lending a surprisingly realistic look. A delicately carved locust and katydid (a type of cricket) are perched elegantly on its leaves, to boot. Its artistry, unusual subject, and the fact that it likely belonged to a Qing-dynasty consort give the cabbage massively popular appeal, making it one of the most-viewed objects at the museum. Walking the several floors of the sprawling museum would make anyone hungry, and the museum’s on-site fine-dining restaurant, the Silks Palace, offers a most unusual banquet: “The National Palace Museum Imperial Treasures Feast” is modeled after the famous objects on display. It includes a pork version of the museum’s famed meat-shaped jasper stone, and fruit arranged in an ice container carved to look like one of China’s ancient bronze cauldrons, the Mao-Kung Ting. But the showstopper is undoubtedly the “Jadeite Cabbage with Insects.” Made from a tiny, tender bok choy and braised with meat broth, the cabbage is arranged upright in a large spoon to resemble its jade counterpart. In place of crickets, Silk Palace’s rendition artfully substitutes shrimp.  To ensure you can order the National Palace Museum Imperial Treasures Feast, be sure to make a reservation. You can find contact information on the restaurant website or email the staff at silkspalacecs@regenttaiwan.com.

The Talmud Business Hotels purports to be inspired by the business lessons that can be gleaned from ancient rabbinic texts. Although the 63-volume, 6,200-page Babylonian Talmud itself touches only occasionally on business practices, the proprietors of the hotel believe that these teachings contain insights for how to achieve financial success in the modern age. The inside of the hotel is a bright red (supposedly inspired by the Talmud), and each guest room reportedly comes with a copy of a book called the Talmud-Business Success Bible in the nightstand. The 52 rooms are decorated in six different styles, each one named after a successful businessman (only two of whom are actually Jewish): Conrad Hilton, John D. Rockefeller, Alan Greenspan, George Soros, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett. A stay at the Talmud Business Hotel should inspire the visitor to become more successful like those six men. And if you wake up feeling like you have not quite fully imbibed the business wisdom of the ancient rabbis, you can venture to a local bookstore to find more Talmudic financial teachings in popular Chinese books such as Know All of the Money-Making Stories of the Talmud and Crack the Talmud: 101 Jewish Business Rules.

The passengers on the ghelyrns were the rabansg, playful dolphin-like creatures who got tired of swimming around the continents and instead invented the ghelyrn to float overland as a shortcut.

The Saba Milkfish Museum is located on a small island in Tainan, a city in southern Taiwan with a robust milkfish aquaculture industry. It was established by Lu Ching-ying, a woman who is known affectionately as the “Queen of Milkfish.” The museum was intended as a way to promote local milkfish businesses, but what started out as a marketing endeavor has become a quirky landmark. Inside, the walls are adorned with large hanging displays of milkfish and tongue-in-cheek cat decor on the side. The space gives a broad overview to the culture and history of milkfish in Taiwan, but also has a whole section where visitors can sample unconventional products like milkfish ice cream and milkfish sausage.

The flagship Modern Toilet is a three-story restaurant in the Datong District of Taiwan. Its name leaving little to the imagination as far as theme goes, the decor is all things bathroom including a heavy representation of…well… poop. Acrylic toilets (seats down) act as dining chairs that pull up to sinks with glass table tops, and the ambiance is generated by shower heads adorning the walls and plunger fixtures containing poop-shaped lights swinging from the ceiling. Your toilet-themed meal is served in either a mini potty or tiny bathtub, and your beverage is, predictably, delivered in a urinal that you are welcome to keep as a yucky souvenir. Most everything on the menu has a feces-related name, but the food is delightfully poop free, and consists of hot pot, curries, and a large dessert selection. It seems as though it would be hard to find a solid market for an eatery so blatantly disgusting, but they seem to be on to something. Inspired by a Japanese cartoon character named Dr. Slump whose favorite past time is “swirling poop on a stick,” owner Dao Ming Zi aimed to shock the senses and capitalize on the attraction of novelty with Modern Toilet.

Tucked away up Shuqi Road (really just a staircase leading from the bustling Jishan Street alley), surrounded by restaurants and lanterns, you’ll find a creepy but colorful collection of masks hanging around a doorway. The door leads to sculptor Wu Jyh Chyang’s museum of over 1,500 self-made ghost masks, chillingly titled the “Painful Life Mask Exhibition.” The masks depict a wide variety of disfigured creatures, seemingly attempting to warn us of the indulgences that have led to their gruesome deaths. The characters shown in the masks range from the simply absurd and humorous to the downright disgusting. Some look more human, others quite demonic, and each is given a unique name: “Smoking Ghost,” “The Boss,” “Coward Ghost,” “Goat Horns Man,” and so on. Imagine, if you will, a set of props from the cult classic horror movie Hellraiser, only these masks have been doused in bright (albeit now a bit dust-covered) primary colors and adorned with real-life objects such as cigarettes and animal hair.

194,Sarez Lake,"Rushon, Tajikistan",The largest dam in the world and the site of a potential disaster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarez-lake,"Sarez Lake is a mountain lake deep in the inaccessible Pamir Mountains of Central Tajikistan. The lake was created in 1911, when an earthquake, estimated at 7.0 at the Richter Scale, and a following landslide of 2.2 million cubic meters, created a huge natural barrier known as the Usoi Dam. At a height of 567 meters, it is the largest dam in the world, either natural or man-made. Thanks to its extremely remote location, it took more than a month before local authorities became aware of the creation of this huge dam, which successively allowed the valley to be flooded by constant rain and meltwater. It wasn’t long before the entire unpopulated valley was flooded, and created a lake with a volume of more than 16 cubic kilometers. But this lake is a constant source of worries to the Tajik government, since, given its location in one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the world, it seems highly likely that a future earthquake could destroy the dam and release a catastrophic flash flood. If this flood occurred, the entire content of the lake would be pressed through the narrow valleys of Tajikistan, destroying everything in its way, endangering more than five million people. It could also affect the neighboring countries Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Another constant threat is that filtration water apparently created a number of cavities inside the dam, which might destabilize the entire dam wall. But the largest threat is a partially detached rock mass of three cubic kilometers at the edge of the lake, which, if it fell into the lake, it could put too much additional pressure on the dam, and might result in its collapse. In 2004, a monitoring system has been put in place on Sarez Lake and valleys, that would be affected by the destruction of Sarez Lake, received an early-warning system.",disaster areas geological oddities natural wonders water geology nature
195,Wall of Great Tajik Writers,"Dushanbe, Tajikistan",A building facade covered with the statues of 11 giants of Tajik literature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wall-of-great-tajik-writers,"If you thought that all there was to Tajik literature was the famous Persian poet Rudaki, perhaps you might want to visit the Wall of Great Tajik Writers. The “Wall” is the facade of the Writers’ Union building in Dushanbe, home to an association of novelists, poets, playwrights, and other writers. The large wall is carved with nine niches containing eleven life-size statues of famous Tajik writers, a tribute to Tajikistan’s Persian and Soviet history. The 8th-century “Adam of Poets,” Rudaki, justifiably takes the centre stage. He is considered a father of classical Persian literature, though sadly only a small portion of his work has survived the test of time. Other notable writers on the wall include poet Ferdowsi (940-1020); poet, mathematician and astronomer Omar Khayyam (1048-1131); writer and intellectual Sadriddin Ayni (1878-1954); and poet Mirzo Tursunzoda (1911-1977). In the garden next to the building is a large statue of Ayni and famous Soviet writer Maxim Gorky sitting around a table, absorbed in conversation. The Writers’ Union building was designed by renowned architect E. Salikhov and constructed in the early 1980s. The structure immediately became an exemplary manifestation of Soviet Modernist architecture, a trend that incorporated local sensibilities within the Soviet architectural tradition, which emphasized social purposefulness, grandiosity (regarding size), and frugality (regarding construction materials). All these features are clearly seen in Salikhov’s creation in Dushanbe. The Writers’ Union dates back to the Soviet era, when all literary organizations were absorbed into a union supervised by the government. The objective was to ensure that contemporary and older literary work for public consumption would not contravene Communist ideals. Nowadays, the organization’s goals resemble those of writers’ unions in most any other country.  The Writers’ Union Building is located in the center of the city, next to the National Museum of Tajikistan, Rudaki Park (another tribute to the famous poet), the Dushanbe Flag Pole, and many other attractions in the capital.",writing culture soviet history literature statues history architecture

This flurry of activities did not escape the keen eye of the Kushan Empire, which realized that traders needed safe passage to transport their goods, which they could guarantee in exchange for levies. A large number of fortresses were built with the dual purpose of protecting traders from raiders and protecting the empire from neighboring peoples. Yamchun Fortress is the best preserved of all these constructions. The fortress is not in great shape, but given that it sits on top of a highly eroded hill in an area prone to earthquakes and landslides, it is a marvel that it is still standing. Originally built in 300 BC (or 100 BC according to some sources), Yamchun overlooks large swathes of the Wakhan Valley, and large sections of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northernmost Afghan territories. How much of the original fortress is visible today is debatable, as the ancient structure was expanded between the 10th and 12th centuries. The triangular shape of the fortress follows approximately the shape of the hilltop.  Two layers of fortified walls delineate its perimeter. Round towers with narrow openings look down toward the valley. Looking at the towers still standing, it is clear that they were built in stages, judging from the different coloring of the stones and bonding material. It is suspected that within the Yamchum Fortress there was a Zoroastrian temple of eternal fire. Considering it was the predominant religion of the time, this would be hardly surprising, but there is no unanimous consensus as to whether there actually was a temple in the fortress.  Public transport to Yamchum village is patchy to say the least. Only a handful of shared taxis come this far, but it is common to flag down any passing vehicle and contribute to the cost of the ride.  From Yamchun village to the fortress is another 8 km of gentle uphill switchbacks or 4 km of steep climbing along trails. Having your own vehicle is by far the best option.",silk road fortresses ancient ruins
197,Hulbuk Fortress,"Pingan, Tajikistan",This medieval citadel once guarded the western entrance of the Pamir Highway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hulbuk-fortress,"From the ninth to 12th centuries, Hulbuk was one of the biggest cities in Central Asia. There, a citadel guarded the western entrance of the Pamir Highway and the nearby salt mines of Khoja Mumin. Two palaces were built inside the citadel; the lower palace in the ninth and 10th centuries and the upper in the 11th and 12th centuries. But when the kingdom collapsed, so did the citadel. It became overrun by Mongols and Turkish tribes. In the centuries afterward, a new market town, Kulob, was founded nearby. In the 1950s, Soviet archaeologists excavated the site. Several artifacts can be seen in the museum of antiquities in Dushanbe, as well as in the museum at the other site of the road. Wallpaintings of animal-gods, swastikas, and dancers show that Hulbuk was more Zoroastrian than Islamic. Recently, the citadel walls were completely rebuilt in the Muslim style, with shiny bricks and inlaid Koran verses at the majestic entrance gate.  The fortress cannot be missed when traversing between Kulob/Vose and Danghara. There's a lovely museum on the other side of the road. Formally, the fortress is closed to visitors, as excavations are ongoing. But if you're kind, the site warden may answer your questions and tell you about his own excavation work.",preservation forts archaeology ruins
198,Shorbulak Observatory,Tajikistan,"This remote, abandoned Soviet observatory promises spectacular views for those who can reach it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shorbulak-observatory,"An abandoned Soviet observatory on the top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere in Tajikistan sounds inviting, no? Shorbulak Observatory, once the site of challenging astronomical observations, stands as a remnant of the former Soviet Union. Located some 4,350 meters (14,200 feet) above sea level, this remote site in the Pamir mountains was perfect for an observatory. The dry climate made it an ideal spot to study submillimeter-wavelength astronomy. Observing these incredibly short wavelengths can be especially challenging because water in the atmosphere can interfere with measurements. Land-based observatories that can study this type of astronomy must be located at dry, cool sites with stable weather conditions located far from dense population. Other sites include Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory in Chile, the South Pole, and Hanle in India. Shorbulak was an outpost of the Pulkovo Observatory—officially known as the Central Astronomical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences at Pulkovo. It was one of several offshoots of Pulkovo Observatory, with others located in Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Caucasus Mountains, Chile, and Bolivia. In the 1980s, the observatory was run by Russian astrophysicist Kirill Maslennikov. Though it is no longer active, Shorbulak Observatory still stands in its location in the Pamirs. But reaching it is no easy feat. First you must get to the Pamir Highway, the second highest altitude  highway in the world. Heading south of the city of  Murgab, you must get off the beaten path for a good piece of land and sandy roads. It takes a while, but as soon as you get there you are rewarded with the site of an abandoned Soviet village, old trucks, warehouses, and the empty observatory right over the hill.  It is possible to visit the village and see the outside of the observatory, but the building itself is private property. Please be respectful of the laws and posted signs.

199,Tomb of Rudaki,"Panjakent, Tajikistan",Where the father of Persian poetry is laid to rest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-rudaki,"Nestled in the Fan mountains in the northwest of Tajikistan is the resting place of the man known as the father of Persian poetry. Born around 859, Rudaki is one of the primary historical figures of post-Soviet Tajikistan, strongly figuring into the national identity as a symbol of not just artistic achievement but also as a cultural touchstone for modern Tajiks. Rudaki, born as Abu ‘Abdollah Ja’far ibn Mohammed, enjoys a certain status as a more glamorous historical figure, one who was semi-royalty, serving as a court poet in Bukhara to the Samanid ruler Nasr II until he lost favor in 937 and returned to his hometown of Panjrud, where he lived the rest of his life in poverty until his death around 941. Also known as an accomplished singer and musician, Rudaki has even been portrayed in Satim Ulughzoda’s 1959 film Qismat-i Sho’ir (in English, “A Poet’s Fate”) as a kind of literary action hero/heartthrob in the dramatized biopic. In Tajikistan’s capital of Dushanbe, about five hours driving distance from Rudaki’s hometown and resting place of Panjrud, everything from the main avenue to a large public park near the parliament building, complete with a giant statue of the poet, are graced by his name. Despite his fame and prominence in Tajik culture in particular, there is a stillness, a sanctity imparted by the mausoleum’s remote location, about 40 miles outside the city of Panjakent. The gravel road leading to Rudaki’s resting place is rocky and uneven, and though the mausoleum was built in 1958, the villagers of Panjrud still look up with surprise at the sight of foreigners and tourists. The keeper of the mausoleum unlocks the carved wooden gates that enclose an expansive, well-manicured, brilliantly green garden filled with roses. Written over the gate—in both the Perso-Arabic script that Rudaki wrote in in the 10th century, and the Cyrillic script in which Tajiki is written in now—is one of the poet’s most famous verses, which states, “There is no greater joy in this world/ Than seeing the faces of friends.” Inside, the surrounding walls and marble floors are a pristine, glowing, almost heavenly white, diffused in natural light that shines from holes in the ceiling onto the dark wooden coffin, topped with marble, resting in the center of the mausoleum. Downhill from Rudaki’s actual resting place is a small museum which displays artifacts from Rudaki’s life and the history of the Sughd region, along with a library of numerous translations and editions of the work of Rudaki and other Persian poets. Academics estimate that Rudaki produced upwards of 100,000 poems, or bayts, although only 1,000 have survived and are in existence today, many of them in fragments and found from varying sources. Still, Rudaki is credited with establishing Persian as a poetic language and influencing the style and form of generations of Persian poets after him.  You can drive from Panjakent via taxi or mashrutka. Nowadays there's a decent asphalt road from the main highway (between Penjikent and Dushanbe) all the way to the parking of the tomb.",mausoleums tombs literature
200,Ancient Panjakent,"Nohijai Pançakent, Tajikistan",The remains of an ancient city-state along the Silk Road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-panjakent,"Ancient Panjakent was one of the easternmost settlements of the Sogdiana Empire, an Iranian civilization that ruled large swathes of territories in central Asia more than a thousand years ago. Zoroastrianism was the predominant religion of the empire, and its holy books mention Sogdiana as the second-best land that god created. Sogdiana history goes back to the Bronze Age and further, and includes such historic celebrities as Cyrus the Great, Darius I, Xerxes, and Alexander the Great. But the empire began flourishing around the beginning of the 400s CE, thanks to extensive trade along the Silk Road. Countless Sogdian settlements of all sizes could be found along the famous ancient trade route, and the bigger ones acted as de facto city-states. Panjakent was one of them, and its importance was underpinned by the fact that anyone traveling between Samarkand and Kuhiston Mountains had to pass through this city. Archaeologists found evidence that Panjakent was founded around the year 400 and was abandoned by the end of 800. Year 722 marked the arrival of Arab conquerors, which prompted the abandonment of the city and the introduction of the Islamic religion in the region. Unlike most other ancient settlements in central Asia, Ancient Panjakent was abandoned in haste and never built over by subsequent dwellers. Excavations of the ancient city began in 1946 and are still ongoing. To date, archaeologists have unearthed residential and suburban quarters that include two Zoroastrian temples, modest dwellings, and workshops; the citadel, which includes a large palace and fortified walls; and the necropolis, with evidence of ossuaries and fire-altars typical of Zoroastrian civilizations. Separating these buildings is a network of streets and lanes that were often covered by vaults. The predominant construction method was mud and clay bricks, which is still used nowadays for pens and stables. One of the most remarkable findings in Ancient Panjakent were the frescoes, some of which were remarkably well preserved and show revealing aspects of life and religious beliefs from the era. Some of these frescoes are now housed at Rudaki Museum, located in the centre of Panjakent, while others are in the National Museum in Dushanbe and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.  The above map coordinates will take you to the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Penjikent excavations. Ancient Panjakent is perched on top of a hill overlooking modern-day Panjakent, and it is not fenced off, which means that there are several entry points. There is, however, an official entrance that taxi drivers usually take visitors to. For a small fee, visitors gain access to the ancient city and the museum across the street. The term “museum” may be an overstatement since it consists of a room with some artifacts excavated in the area and some information about Russian archaeologist B. Marshak, who led the excavations for decades.",silk road ancient archaeology ruins history
201,Anzob Tunnel,"Ayni, Tajikistan","This dark, damp, perilous tunnel is the only passage from north to south Tajikistan.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anzob-tunnel,"The purpose of a tunnel is to get you from one place to another, preferably alive. The Anzob Tunnel is making no promises in that regard. 5,040 meters of tunneled asphalt make up the connection between north and south Tajikistan, arguably a step up from the former dirt road that was regularly closed due to frequent, almost year-round avalanches.  Called “The Tunnel of Fear” and “The Tunnel of Death” by locals, its importance lies in the fact that, unlike the previous route, it avoids cutting through less-than-friendly Uzbekistan. The construction of this route between major cities Dushanbe and Khujand has allowed commerce to flow with far less interruption, and Tajikistan no longer has to be split in two through the entire winter season. Sounds fantastic, so what’s the problem? It can’t be that dangerous, at least not as dangerous as an unfriendly territory or a snowed-in dirt road, right? Let’s start with illumination in the tunnel–there isn’t any. Aside from the headlights of your vehicle and those of your fellow tunnel dwellers, there is no lighting to speak of. Not completely unheard of; an inconvenience really–until you realize there are potholes. Not small potholes that give you a little rattle as you truck along, but BIG potholes. Big, axle-snapping potholes that are difficult to see in the dark tunnel, that also happen to be filled with water. Some of them have several feet of water, and are basically small, tunnel ponds. The tunnel does, theoretically, possess two lanes in the form of two more-or-less separate tunnels through the mountain; however, one of the two tunnels is perpetually closed for repairs, meaning the tunnel is de facto a permanent one-way street. The reality of the tunnel’s width, however, is ignored as Chinese 18-wheelers, SUVs and sturdy Soviet Ladas navigate a gut-wrenching obstacle course that includes not only oncoming traffic but also broken-down construction equipment and feet-deep ponds. Things could be worse, though: you could always break down. There’s a few reasons why breaking down in this tunnel would be less than ideal, especially since the odds are so stacked against getting to the other side unscathed. Besides being trapped in a dark, wet tunnel where other cars are careening around you in chaos, the most terrifying reason to want to keep moving is the lack of ventilation. With one, pathetic fan attempting to push air around, the tunnel is filled with exhaust so thick that visibility is only a few feet. While carbon monoxide poisoning is certain, the amount of time you spend trapped would determine whether that exposure becomes fatal or not. Travelers have reported feeling dizzy, nauseous and ill while passing through the tunnel; reportedly, workers on the tunnel, who are drawn from surrounding villages and rarely possess adequate air filtration systems, have died due to overexposure to the poisonous emissions. But that’s it – if you can survive the traffic, the potholes and the fumes, then you’re home free! Except for the rocks. There is always the occasional falling rock to keep an eye out for. That’s it though. Other than giant, water-filled potholes, no lights, every-man-for-himself navigation, toxic gasses and the sporadic avalanche, the Anzob Tunnel is totally safe. The tunnel was repaired in the spring and summer of 2015 and is reportedly in much better condition than previously; however, the one-lane-only issue remains. In 2018, the tunnel was just a regular tunnel in Central Asia; for the most part it is lit now, the surface is decent asphalt and there is plenty of room in the “one-lane” for trucks and cars in both directions.",tunnels transportation subterranean sites architectural oddities architecture
202,Tajikistan Lenin Statue,"Khujand, Tajikistan",The largest Lenin statue in Central Asia was moved to an empty field rather than being destroyed.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tajikistan-lenin-statue,"Dismantled and relegated to a field on the outskirts of town, a massive likeness of the Father of the Bolshevik Revolution can’t get any respect in modern society. After decades spent lording over the city, Central Asia’s largest statue of Vladimir Lenin was finally removed from its plinth in downtown Khujand, Tajikistan in May of 2011. Erected in 1974 on the 50th anniversary of Lenin’s death, when Khujand was then called Leninabad, official measurements put the statue at 12 meters in height, plus an additional 12 meters for the base. All together, this made the monument Central Asia’s largest statue of the former leader of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party. But by the dawn of the new millennium, Tajik officials felt the statue’s time had come and gone. So it was with little ceremony and under the cover of darkness that a gigantic likeness of the former leader of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party was dismantled, whereupon his pieces were transported to an out-of-the-way park west of the city called Victory Field. Here Lenin was reassembled atop his perch, where he oversees a field. All this is to say that Tajikistan has effectively relegated Lenin to the safest, deadest quadrant of its history. Back in the bustling sectors of its living, day-to-day world, Lenin’s former footsteps will eventually be occupied by a statue of the founder of Tajik statehood, Ismoili Somoni, where it will likely hold the title of Largest Somoni Statue on Earth.

203,Hisor Fort,"Hisor, Tajikistan","The first version of this stalwart construction appeared around 3,000 years ago.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hisor-fort,"Hisor Fort is conveniently located along the Khanaka River, in Hisor Valley. The building has gone through different reconstructions, renovations, and additions. Historical records point at a fort in Hisor as far back as 1000 BC. More recent records of the fort relate to the time when Cyrus the Great founded the first Persian Empire (around 550 BC). Not much of the original fort has passed the test of time, unfortunately. Dating the current fort is not a straightforward task, as different buildings were added at different times. Inside the fortress, recently, a wedding ceremony building was erected. The oldest surviving part of Hisor Fort is the arched gate, which is probably from around the year 500. Chasmai Mohiyon Mosque was built in 700, the same period of time when the construction of Sangin Mosque (Stone Mosque) also started, but this wasn’t completed until almost 1,000 years later. A salient feature of Sangin Mosque is the four bottomless jugs placed within the walls of the dome to improve the acoustics of the hall. The 1500s mark the building of several components of the fort, namely the wall where the main gate is located, the Old Madrassa, the Makhdumi A’zam Mausoleum, and some additions to the Old Mosque. One of the latest additions next to the fort is a caravanserai from 1808, a place for Silk Road traders and their camels to safely spend the night. Only the lower part of the caravanserai remains, as the top layer was taken by the Soviets to build a theater in Dushanbe. Most of the structures have been renovated. The Old Madrassa houses a museum with items from Tajikistan’s rural past and Soviet memorabilia. Also, old horse stables can be found on the other side of the road.  Hisor is about 16 miles west of Dushanbe. There is plenty of public transport to reach the place, but it is not easy to locate the correct bus stop in Dushanbe. The easiest and fastest to get to Hisor is by taxi, which can be cheap, depending on your bargaining skills.

204,Dushanbe Flagpole,"Dushanbe, Tajikistan",The world's second-tallest flagpole stands proud despite dropping rank.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dushanbe-flagpole,"How high does the Flag of Tajikistan fly? According to the Guinness Book of World Records, higher than any other at a dizzying 541 ft. The Dushanbe Flagpole was constructed by a San Diego-based construction company named Trident Support, who also erected the record breaker’s runner up, the 531 ft. National Flagpole in Azerbaijan. Consisting of 12-meter sections of steel tubing which were assembled by crane, the massive endeavor took five months to complete, the first test flight of the national flag taking place in May, 2011. Such was the state of things until 2014, when its position was usurped by Saudi Arabia’s Jedda Flagpole, which measured in at 170 meters in height. All three flagpoles occupying the top spots on what would be the world’s most precarious podium, in addition to also-rans in Jordan and Abu Dhabi, were marketed, sold and built by Trident Support Corporation, based in San Diego, California. Originally a defense logistics company, Trident has managed to corner the market on this obscure niche of what’s been called the “global dictator dick-measuring contest” since the turn of the new millennium. Tajikistan’s erstwhile most-gigantic-flagpole-ever can be found standing tall in front of Palace of Nations in Dushanbe. In total, the project cost the fledgling nation $3.5 million, part of an exorbitant $210 million spent on construction celebrating the 20th anniversary of Tajikistan’s independence. The Flag of Tajikistan that graces the mighty pole had to be epic in its own right to be seen from such a great distance, weighing in at 1,543 pounds, and measuring approximately 98 × 196 feet. Regardless of whether it occupies the silver medal position for long, when viewed from the ground, those 15 feet that currently separate it from dominating its competitors are hardly noticeable, making for an awesome spectacle made all the more disorienting when placed against the backdrop of Dushanbe’s modest cityscape.",rivals week world's tallest architectural oddities architecture
205,Red Lotus Lake,"Tambon Chiang Haeo, Thailand",Stunning wetlands ablaze with pink lotus flowers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lotus-lake,"A true surprise in northeast Thailand—often considered to be solely a rice-farming region—these wetlands remain predominantly hidden by tall elephant grasses that belie the expanses of water lying beyond them, and are known for the most part only by the local villagers who venture out to fish and to collect snails and lotus stalks for use in the preparation of their daily meals. Best visited in the cool season from December through February, these shallow, limpid waters may only be visited on a wooden boat belonging to the local fishermen and villagers. Having cleared the elephant grasses, a thick carpet of pink lotus blooms suddenly confronts you. A constellation of millions of startling, flamingo-pink lotus flowers dance above the crystalline waters of the Lotus Sea. This is quite literally the land of the lotus-eaters! The seeds and stems may both be eaten, and the flowers are an important Buddhist symbol. If the lotus plant does not seduce you from a culinary standpoint, then do try the fiery local cuisine with its spicy salads, lime-bathed fish, and fresh meat dishes: the food of the Northeast has now become a favorite among the Thais and may be found throughout the kingdom. The wetlands are home to around 80 species of bird, including the endangered grey heron, purple heron, and black kite. Other rare species include the Brahminy kite and the cotton pygmy-goose.  Due to the picturesque sea of pink and red lotus flowers which cover lake Nong Han, this place becomes insanely busy during Valentine's Day weekend by couples all waiting to capture that perfect shot. There is also a Red Lotus Sea Festival which is held mid-January at the nearby Wat Bandiem.

Known as the White Temple, Wat Rong Khun is located in Northern Thailand in Chiang Rai. The project of well-known Thai artist Chalermchai Kosipipat, and the temple was funded by Kosipipat’s selling of his paintings. Construction began in 1997 and was completed in 2008, although new elements are still being added. Kosipipat wanted to create an elegant temple to honor Buddha’s purity, but the temple is distinct in both its style and symbolism. Much of the temple is dedicated to depicting samsara, the Buddhist cycle of birth and death due to delusion and fixation on the self.  Thus, the temple and its grounds are surprisingly contemporary, focusing on fictional elements of our materialistic world: the predator struggling to free itself from the ground, aliens, and elaborate murals depicting Neo from The Matrix, Superman, and an angry bird flying towards the World Trade Center Towers. Photography of the murals is prohibited, but visitors can purchase reproductions at the gift shop. Unlike most Thai temples, the building is all white, with glass and mirrors embedded into the outside to make it shine and sparkle in the sunlight. However, Kosipipat ultimately designed the White Temple to be viewed in moonlight when it appears particularly ghostly and otherworldly. An ornately decorated gold building to the left of the temple houses a public restroom, which is often humorously referred to as the most beautiful restroom in Thailand.

As the rays of the morning sun flood through the roof of the cavern, a small pavilion on the floor of the cave is bathed in a majestic golden glow. It’s the kind of place Indiana Jones would find a fabled life-renewing relic, or where a young apprentice would finally meet a reclusive Jedi Master. The Phraya Nakhon Cave is located inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park in the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province of Thailand. According to local legend, the cave was discovered around 200 years ago when a local ruler, Nakhon Srithammaraja, was forced to abandon his ship during a storm and found refuge in the cave. Some historians, however, believe the cave was discovered by, or at least named after, a nobleman called Nakhon, who lived in the region in the 17th century. Either way, the cave has long been a treasured natural attraction along the northern part of the Malay Peninsula. When sunlight floods into the cavern, it illuminates the cave’s stalagmites and stalactites, and the lush green trees that lean toward the light from the sandy floor below. It’s a serene and mystical sight, and one deemed fit for kings. In 1890, for the visit of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), a mound was built inside the cave. Upon this mound was placed a small pavilion, built in Bangkok and assembled inside the cave. Positioned perfectly to catch the full flood of the morning sunlight, the Khuha Kharuehat Pavilion, as it is known, has since become an iconic symbol of the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. It was later visited by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII), who, like King Chulalongkorn, inscribed his name on the wall of the cavern’s main chamber. The late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) also visited the Phraya Nakhon Cave, but unlike his predecessors he did not leave his signature on the wall.  Phraya Nakhon Cave is located inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park in the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province of Thailand. It’s about 110 miles south-southwest from Bangkok (as the crow flies), and about a 45-minute drive south of Hua Hin. From the small village of Bang Pu, you can either take a boat around the cape to the cave, or hike for 30 to 45 minutes. Either way, you’ll still have a final 1,410-feet hike up steep steps through the forest to the cave entrance. It’s tough going, so take water. The entrance fee to Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park is 200 Thai Baht per person, with no additional fee for the cave. Guides are available but unnecessary, and many of them are children. Go early to avoid the crowds. The sun tends to enter the cave around 10 to 10:30 a.m., although it depends on the season, so best to ask in advance.",intriguing environs temples caves ecosystems

While the garden attracts plenty of families, there are gruesome scenes depicted there. After passing a “Welcome to Hell!” sign, visitors encounter sinners boiled in copper cauldrons, sinners being torn apart by hell’s dogs, and emaciated sinners with protruding ribs. “If you meet the Devil in this life, don’t postpone merit-making which will help you to defeat him in the next life,” a sign in the garden reads. “Donate a little each day and you’ll have a happy life.” According to the “Traibhumi Phra Ruang,” when a Buddhist dies, he or she goes before four celestial beings who check the dead’s record of good and bad deeds. If your good deeds outweigh the bad, you will go to heaven; if your bad deeds outweigh the good, you will be punished. Punishment in Buddhist hell varies depending on the sins committed, but every form of punishment is a torture, and many of those are depicted in the garden. Hell has 136 pits, but individuals are able to be reborn from each. Loganta, a special pit reserved for those who have hurt their parents or monks physically, is the only cold pit and those sent there are said to remain until a new Buddha is born.  The temple is a little difficult to find at first glance. Go all the way down the road until you see an archway. Go through it and you'll see a giant Buddha. Once you get there, be sure to put some donation into the Buddha belly. This temple will not charge you so make sure to leave something generous so they can keep maintaining this amazing location.This is located in Chonburi and takes some time and work to get to from Bangkok for tourists not familiar with the area.

When it comes to the amulets themselves, there aren’t a lot of hard and fast rules. Few of the articles for sale are larger than, say, a baseball, while most fit easily in the palm of one’s hand. Many are purported to contain particles from sacred temples far away, such as spent incense, blessings from monks, etc. The amulets can take the form of Buddhas bearing a range of expressions, to shards of bone, medallions, chunks of wood from sacred spaces varying expressions, brass phalluses, or even real human parts – like hair. All these elements combine to create tokens of good luck that have been protecting generations of working Thai men from all sorts of terrible fates. At the Amulet market, there are no shamans around to help in the divination process. It’s up to each individual doing the digging to identify which treasure speaks to their need. This makes a simple people-watching excursion to the Amulet Market one of the more gratifying and mystical experiences around, even if you yourself aren’t looking to take home a small something with magical potential. Amulets can cost as little as 5 baht (the same price as a trip to some public toilets) and up to hundreds of baht. Prices are rarely displayed, implying some haggling or bargaining is necessary. While you’re in the area, don’t forget about the nearby side alleys (heading towards the water). Some heavy rings and more amulets may catch your eyes, and there are enough cheap food stalls to feed the staff that work in the immediate area. Serviced by ferries from Chang Pier, Maharaj Pier, and Phra Chan Tai Pier. From National Stadium BTS, take exit 2 down to street level, make a U-turn, and walk 20 meters to the bus stop. Get on bus 47 and ride for 20-30 minutes. Get off when you’re in front of the Grand Palace or Sanam Luang (the big park just past it). There’s a side street heading left between the two; head down that for about 400 meters and turn right. The beginning of the market should be across the street to your right.",markets shops religion sacred spaces

Or, in the case of Bangkok restaurant Wattana Panich, the next generation. The giant pot of neua tune, a beef stew popular in the Thai capital, has been simmering since owner Nattapong Kaweenuntawong was a child, more than 45 years ago. Growing up studying the exact flavor profile of the stew from his father, Kaweenuntawong now balances the flavor himself daily. He employs an ancient practice called Hunter’s Stew or Perpetual Stew, using some of the previous day’s leftover broth to start the base of the following day’s soup. “We keep tasting. There is no recipe,” he told Channel News Asia. A secret blend of spices and herbs, stewed beef, raw beef slices, meatballs, tripe, and other organs swim about the deeply bubbling vat. While new restaurants and high-end condominiums now dwarf the humble one-story bistro in Bangkok’s busy Ekamai neighborhood, the complex and rich flavor of Wattana Panich’s headline soup keeps the dish relevant and its followers loyal.",prepared beef stew soup street food

Although this tower karst was a relatively unknown indigenous site before the early ’70s, that all changed when the British Secret Service’s number one agent came to town. In 1974, the James Bond film The Man With the Golden Gun was released. One of the film’s scenes featured Bond’s nemesis, Francisco Scaramanga, hiding out at Phang Nga Bay and using the solar panels on the island to power his laser gun. The movie, which referred to the island as a “mushroom-shaped rock,” catapulted Phang Nga Bay’s tourism industry, so much so that the island was dedicated to 007 himself with the name of James Bond Island. But James Bond is not the only namesake of the tall little islet, which is located just offshore from Khao Phing Kan island, part of Ao Phang Nga National Park. According to local mythology, the island was created when one day a Thai fisherman failed to catch a single fish and came up only with a nail. In frustration, he’d throw the nail into the ocean, but magically, the nail would return to his hand. In anger, the fisherman cut the nail in half with a knife, letting the half-nail fall into the bay. To the fisherman’s astonishment, the half-nail erupted to form the giant nail-shaped limestone tower that stands today, giving it its original Thai name, Ko Ta Pu, or Nail Island.",names national parks film locations islands

The Siriraj is actually comprised of six different museums: a museum of pathology, a forensics museum, a museum of the history of Thai medicine, a parasitology museum, an anatomical museum, and a prehistoric museum. The Ellis Pathological Museum is the oldest of the six museums, founded by the American pathologist Dr. Aller G. Ellis. He collected organs from patients who had been diagnosed with common disorders such as heart disease and cancer,  to serve as teaching tools for medical students. The Siriraj’s incredible holdings include bones, preserved organs, pathological fetuses, the mummified corpse of a notorious serial killer, a traditional Thai medicine shop, parasitic worms, a two-and-a-half-foot-wide scrotum removed from a man afflicted with elephantiasis, preserved sections of human skin bearing tattoos, poisonous snakes and tarantulas, rows of skulls, the standing wax-filled remains of a cannibal, a delicately dissected nervous system, and the skeleton of the museum’s founder.

Developers envisaged a city of gleaming offices and residential skyscrapers that were to be a testament to the nation’s rapid development. Then Thailand sank into a swamp of reckless investments and unpaid debts that became known as the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The country’s economy contracted 10% in 1998 and many of the building projects came to a crashing halt, including this 49-story tower. Many towers have finally come to completion and construction is continuing, however many broke developers are still unable or unwilling to take action. The Sathorn Unique has an eerie feel, with exposed infrastructure giving it a post-apocalyptic look. According to one blogger, abandoned rooms were filled with curious objects, from mannequins to a picture of the King. Locals say that the building is haunted. Have a look at the building’s commercial brochure: “Sathorn Unique Tower is our first residential project in downtown Bangkok. The tower is 49 stories with the total of 659 residential units and 54 retails, located only less than 200 meters from BTS: Taksin station. Sathorn Unique Tower is also located at the edge of old commercial town of Charernkrung meets the new international business zone of Silom-Sathorn roads. It sits on the horse-shoe bend which is considered the best place for overlook at the Bangkok’s grand cityscape and the charm of the Chaopraya River.” Getting to the top terrace of the building is possible, but it is absolutely not a good idea, and the structure is fragile and bares many holes in the floors. Instead, check out the tower’s 10-storey high car park, just opposite to the building (North side of the tower). Adapted with permission from Exploguide.com dedicated to travelers looking for alternative and off the beaten track travel.  This place is off limits. As of June 2016, a fence made of corrugated tin now surrounds the tower, and there's plenty of signs indicating that trespassers will be prosecuted. It's not impossible to get in, but it's certainly illegal. There are people working or living within the corrugated walls of the Sathorn depsite its rundown state.

Six times a day, vendors and buyers have three minutes to get out of the way. A very loud whistle gives the warning call, and everyone scrambles to move produce off the tracks, roll back awnings, and take down umbrellas before the train arrives. In fact, the market is sometimes called the “umbrella pull down market” for this very reason. But vendors have to do a lot more than that. They have to pick up baskets of fish, beans, and bananas and move them off the tracks. In some cases, they just leave them as they know the train will clear them. As the train comes through the very narrow market lane, there is only inches to spare on each side. Maeklong Railway Market is also called the world’s most dangerous market. Unfortunately, people have occasionally lost their lives, though the train moves very slowly through the market. The bizarre phenomenon leads many people to visit the market for the novelty of seeing the train run right through it, rather than for the goods sold. The market sells mostly fresh foods, Thai sweets, flowers, herbs, spices, drinks, fish, and seafood. In fact, it’s one of the biggest seafood markets in Thailand. But the food aside, seeing the sprawling market spring to life when the train rolls through makes for a worthwhile stop when you’re in the area. Just remember: when you hear the whistle, step back, and maybe get your camera ready.  The market is located in Samut Songkhram city, Muang Samut Songkhram District, which runs along the Gulf of Thailand’s coastline southwest of Bangkok. It’s only about 60km from Bangkok. You can get there by train, public van (minibus), or car. A fun thing to do is ride the Maeklong Railway through the market, and then get off and explore.",markets railroads trains transportation food
218,Wat Pha Sorn Kaew (Temple on the Glass Cliff),"Tambon Khaem Son, Thailand",Modern design and unusual architecture make this mountaintop temple no ordinary Buddhist retreat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phar-sorn-kaew-temple-on-the-glass-cliff,"Hidden away high up in the hills of north central Thailand, Wat Pha Sorn Kaew is a Dharma retreat for monks and Buddhist followers. The mountaintop sanctuary, with a preaching hall, pagoda, and surrounding gardens, is a stunning design, one that expresses its architectural youthfulness. The site’s location at Khao Kho was chosen for its natural beauty, to inspire meditation. Set against the serenity of the mountains is the site’s most striking feature, the ice-white temple itself, representing the traditional five Buddhas who visited the Earth. The Buddhas are nested together in the meditation position, looking out over the valley. Each one is slightly larger than the one before, a modern and refreshing design with few hints of traditional Thai architecture. The non-traditional design extends to the pagoda, a lotus flower-inspired shape set over five levels, with a large glass structure hanging down through the centre to connect each floor. The surfaces are covered with over 5 million mosaic tiles, pottery shards, and pieces of teapots and China sets, with no two patterns alike. It’s colorful and quirky, and sitting in the middle of the mosaics is said to bring fortune and good luck. Wat Pha Sorn Kaew (also known as Wat Pra Tat Pha Kaew and Watpratarpharsornkaew) was mostly completed in 2004, and was elevated to the status of temple only in 2010. In its short history, despite its remote location, it has become a center for the foundation of mindfulness practice, one of the core Buddhist principles. It could be argued that Wat Pha Sorn Kaew feels out of place in the remote hills of northern Thailand, and it does bear a striking resemblance to the style of Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí. Its style is unlike any other, but no matter the design, the views are breathtaking and the landscape inspiring. In that respect, the temple in the mountains is much like its traditional ancestors. Wat Pha Sorn Kaew is a relatively new site, having been completed in 2004, and is not widely recognised as a tourist attraction, therefore it can be quite difficult to visit. It is located about 5 hours north of Bangkok, between the towns of Lom Sak and Phitsanulok in the Phetchabun region. At present, the only way of reaching the temple is by your own transport or on a private tour.",buddhism temples mountains architectural oddities architecture

It has been considerably altered over the years, most notably by the young Prince Mongkut who would later become King Rama IV of Thailand. Today, the temple is the headquarters of the Mahanikai school of Buddhism, Thailand’s largest monastic order. It’s used as a center for monastic learning for members of the school who come from all across Southeast Asia. The temple is also home to the Center for Vipassana Meditation at Buddhist University, and is one of several in Bangkok that offers classes in meditations. Some programs are taught in English. Originally built to house a relic of the Buddha, Wat Mahathat is one of the oldest shrines in Bangkok. The temple is tucked away on the grounds, surrounded by a confusing layout of schools, offices, and other buildings. When you come to the entrance to the inner courtyard, push your way through the door. It tends to be closed to keep out the noise of the surrounding environs. The courtyard is packed with statues and relics, with an out-of-place garden of tall palm trees pushed to the back. Next to the temple, vendors gather every Sunday for Bangkok’s largest amulet market, where they peddle religious amulets, talismans, charms, and traditional medicine. All of the amulets have a different purpose: to restore health, to bring great wealth, or to keep enemies away, for example.

Papaya Studio is a veritable Valhalla for quirky vintage collectibles. The store is the brainchild of the eccentric Mr. Tong, a collector of antiques, vintage, and curiosities from around the globe. For the past 25 years, he’s been accumulating everything from vintage Scandinavian designer furniture, creepy mannequin dolls, Chinese porcelain, retro racing bikes, life-size action hero figures, and literally thousands of other curiosities in his massive warehouse. Spread over multiple massive halls, the items are on display in a maze of mock living rooms, spacious photo studios, and huge cabinets. There is no store map or publicly visible store index, but items are placed according to some form of logic, either by era—Victorian furniture, retro furniture, and so on–or function, such as chairs, mirrors, or children’s toys. All items are technically for sale, but visitors are almost discouraged from taking anything home, as none of the items have a price tag showing, and most of the prices are surprisingly steep. In some cases, the owner might simply refuse to sell certain items, simply because they’ve become such a prized part of his collection.

221,Elephant Nature Park,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Thailand's distressed elephants find peace at this Chiang Mai sanctuary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-nature-park,"Set in Thailand’s Chiang Mai province, Elephant Nature Park provides a sanctuary to rescued elephants from around the country. Originally founded in 1990, Elephant Nature Park is roughly 60 kilometers from Chiang Mai city, tucked away in the picturesque hills of Northern Thailand. Serving as a rescue and rehabilitation center for elephants from around the country, Elephant Nature Park is—simply put—the ethical way to enjoy the company of a pachyderm when in Asia. In Thailand, elephant populations have decreased significantly from 100,000 a century ago to now a measly 3,000 estimated elephants remaining. The decline in elephant numbers is namely due to the animals being used for the tourism and logging industries, which subjects these magnificent creatures to harrowing abuse. For tourists, riding an elephant or purchasing a painting from a pachyderm may seem harmless enough, but it is the “training” techniques used to have the animals perform such feats that are cause for concern. Mahouts—a term for men who work with elephants in Southeast Asia—often subject their animals to barbaric forms of physical abuse to intimidate, scare, and ultimately break the spirit of the elephant. At Elephant Nature Park, the rescued elephants who arrive at the sanctuary can often come with broken bones, psychological issues, and baring the scars of years of abuse. The silver lining is Elephant Nature Park fights to save these animals and give them a stress-free environment where volunteers can spend time with the elephants in an ethical way. From feeding the elephants copious amounts of watermelon to walking alongside them as they meander down the river, to simply watching them play in the mud, Elephant Nature Park puts the focus on the wellbeing of its animals. In short, a visit to this sanctuary is how animal tourism should be: putting the animal first.  A visit to Elephant Nature Park requires advance booking online. Volunteers have the option of a one-day visit with the elephants, a half-day visit, or a two-day visit with an overnight stay on the property. If timing permits, it is worth spending the night at Elephant Nature Park to truly experience the beauty of this animal sanctuary and catch some extra time with the elephants. While the main draw of Elephant Nature Park is the elephants, the sanctuary is also home to cats and dogs that have been rescued from around the country. Elephant Nature Park has additional locations in Cambodia, Surin, and Kanchanaburi with different volunteer programs and lengths offered at each park.",nature animals

And like most waterfalls in the world, and rivers in general, the wet rocks nearby tend to be slippery, often treacherously so. But one waterfall, Bua Tong, stands out from the crowd for offering a surprising amount of traction. Bua Tong Waterfall is a small, picturesque waterfall whose milky-white waters tumble through the surrounding jungle. It falls over three tiers, at an angle of about 45 to 50 degrees, over rocks that have a strange bubble-like appearance. If this were any normal waterfall, it would be great to slide down the slippery rocks. But people don’t come to slide down Bua Tong, known as the Sticky Waterfall by locals. Instead, they walk up it. The waterfall is fed by a calcium-rich spring at the top, which plunges down over the rocks. Over time, mineral deposits have given the rocks a pumice-like texture. So rather than being perilously slippery, the wet rocks along the Bua Tong Waterfall are actually quite rough and therefore easy to walk along—and up—even when wet. You can walk barefoot over the “sticky” rocks, which are rough but not so rough that they’ll cut or hurt your feet. You still need to watch out for some sneaky rocks that offer less traction and are therefore potentially slippery. These tend to be grayer in color than the surrounding rocks. The waterfall is a popular spot among locals, especially on the weekend, but is still quite light on tourists. So you can normally make the ascent without any crowds, enjoying the refreshing water and the jungle scenery as you walk up the Sticky Waterfall. And if you feel like walking some more afterward, there’s a trail from near the top of the falls to Nam Phu Chet Si, a sacred spring and shrine in the jungle. Its supposedly healing waters contain the same calcium carbonate that made Bua Tong sticky.  Bua Tong Waterfall is located about 20 miles north (as the crow flies) of Chiang Mai, which is the largest city in northern Thailand and the capital of Chiang Mai Province. To get to the waterfall from Chiang Mai, head north along highway 1001. Stay on the highway and after about an hour and a half you’ll see a sign telling you to turn right for Bua Tong Waterfall. After that it’s a short drive to the falls. You can get there easily by taxi, motorbike or tour. There is no entrance fee to the Sticky Waterfall.

The resort stands alone at the end of a road off the main highway, over 18 miles from the nearest city, which itself is a tiny market town near the border of Myanmar with no amenities for tourists. However once arrived at the resort guests can sleep in fully stocked dwellings shaped like colossal pineapple, dragonfruit, durian, mangosteen, mushroom, bamboo shoots, and more, all the while surrounded by orchards growing the real deal. Clearly a lover of sweet produce, the owner plans to attract school groups and clubs interested in horticulture and nature. Twelve years ago, he began collecting rare fruit varieties from all over Thailand to plant on the 80 acre property, as well as exotic flowers from abroad. In particular, he focused on durian, a fruit whose bizarre combination of lethally sharp spikes and pungent aroma makes an instant impression (it is also known as the “corpse fruit”). Now the site cultivates over 100 varieties of the stinky fruit, making it one of only a few places in Thailand that serves as a genetic bank. Visitors seek who want to taste durian should visit in late May or June. In addition to the quirky fruit buildings, nearby attractions include a small waterfall, a natural hot spring, some beautiful misty mountains.

Founded by politician and family planning activist Mechai Viravaidya (who is also known by the nickname “Mr. Condom”) the large restaurant was opened next to one of the few family planning clinics in Bangkok that offers abortions for the impoverished women in the community. While pregnancy termination is allowed by law in the city, it is often thought to be illegal and contraceptive measures, in general, are often seen as taboo, thus Viravaidya started his restaurant with the intention of raising understanding and acceptance of birth control (as well as to serve food). This devotion to the titular form of protection can be seen in the ubiquitous condoms decorating almost every corner of the eatery. From the small gift area near the entrance featuring informational pamphlets on family planning and a visual guide to varieties of condoms to mannequins covered in dresses made of prophylactics and studded by birth control pills, diners are surrounded on all sides by rubber reminders of safe sex. Lampshades, wall decorations, and even Christmas tree trimmings are constructed out of the proverbial raincoats, giving guests no place to rest their eyes that doesn’t have some playful new use for the protective device. Then at the end of the meal, diners are given their own condom in lieu of dinner mints. While the almost cartoonishly overblown presentation of condoms in the restaurant seems silly, the purpose is to make the otherwise taboo item more mundane and less exotic, and the gambit seems to be working. Along with a number of other initiatives begun by Viravaidya, Cabbages & Condoms has contributed to a staggering decrease in children being born to Bangkok families. In addition, the restaurant itself has become so successful that the brand has been expanded to include a hotel and franchise locations reaching as far as the United Kingdom.",restaurants shops

In the humid buzz of Thailand’s capital, this urban farm and fish pond within a fine-dining restaurant take sustainability to a new level. Pass through a long driveway framed by edible flowers in a remote corner of Bangkok’s Asoke neighborhood and you’ll arrive at what claims to be the first urban farm and zero-waste restaurant in the country. A server will take you on a tour of both the aquaponic and vertical farms that together supply some of the menu’s produce. A large koi pond stretches the length of the building. The evaporation from the pond keeps the building cool while the waste from the fish (which appear on the menu themselves) is circulated throughout the aquaponic section to deliver nutrients to more delicate produce such as mizuna, mint, borage, and dill. The chic restaurant was designed with juxtaposition in mind. The serene dining room is nestled within the bustle of Asoke, with warm wooden accents tempering the edge of black metal. Simple produce from the farm is transformed into edible works of art, often using complex molecular techniques. Neo-Indian tasting menus using hyper-local Thai ingredients highlight head chef Deepanker Khosla’s expertise while also employing the farm’s multitude of fresh fish and greens. A refined galouti kebab dish is enhanced by citrus gel and Thai truffles, while a dish called “Prawns on the Rock” couples tamarind with peanut and lime foam. “Haoma in a Bite” is comprised solely of ingredients harvested from the premises: house carp gets topped with mustard greens and a seven-herbed chlorophyll jelly before kombucha SCOBY crisps are crested atop. In the name of zero waste, much of the cocktails are made up of scraps from the kitchen. Strawberries (along with their oft-discarded stems) are juiced and hardened into the fruit leather that graces the simply named “Strawberry” cocktail, while the tongue-in-cheek “Kale” slips gin into a blend of up-cycled avocado, kale, apple, and celery. This secluded, verdant pocket of Bangkok may have just cracked the sustainable restaurant code.

Phra Prang Sam Yot is a 13th century temple built by the Khmer King Jayavarman VII. It was originally used as a Buddhist temple, converted to a temple to Shiva after Jayavarman’s death, then repurposed for Buddhism again in the 1600s, all of which is evident in its multi-symbolic architecture. It remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in the old city of Lopburi, but not for its religious significance or cultural history. It’s because of the monkeys. The temple has been overrun by macaques. This may have started because of the annual Monkey Buffet Festival that occurs in the city, during which locals give them fruits and vegetables. Now the monkey population is over 2,000, and most of them live in the temple in relative isolation from the human population. However, living in such close quarters with humans has made them unafraid to snatch treats and personal belongings right out of your hands.

229,"Wat Saam Prasob, the Sunken Temple","Tambon Nong Lu, Thailand","During the rainy season, this temple is almost entirely submerged, accessible only by boat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-saam-prasob-sunken-temple,"When the Vajiralongkorn Dam in Thailand was constructed in 1984, there was great consternation in the Mon community living near the dam site. Members of the Mon tribe, who had fled nearby Myanmar to escape the continuous conflicts taking place there, lived in a small village along the border between the two countries. But after the construction of the dam most of the village was flooded, and the refugees had to find a new place to live, in a country that was not their own. The only structure from the submerged town that remains today is the Waat Sam Prasob shrine, also known as the Sunken Temple or the Wat Wang Wiwekaram. Built by the Mon and Karen tribes, it was once the heart of the old town. Today, during the rainy season when the reservoir levels are high, the top half and the steeple are the only parts of the temple that are visible, and a boat ride takes you around the curious structure. When the region is drier, it is possible to walk around and inside to take a closer look at the ruins. Luangpo Uttama, the abbot of the old temple who was himself a Mon refugee, helped the Mon people relocate to their current location in the Ban Wangka village, opposite the town of Sangkhlaburi. A wooden bridge spanning 1,300 feet was built to connect the two settlements, named Uttama Nusorn after the abbot who was instrumental in the development of the region. It is the longest wooden bridge in Thailand and is thought to be the second longest in the world. Popularly called the Mon bridge or Saphan Mon, it was built over the Songkalia river and overlooks a scenic landscape, making it a favorite of tourists and photographers. Vehicles are not allowed on the bridge but it is possible to walk across and visit the Mon village.  It is accessible through bus or car from Kanchanaburi. There are many guest houses next to the old bridge.",sunken cities flooded towers dams rivers hidden bridges
230,Wat Tha Ka Rong,"Tambon Ban Pom, Thailand",A colorful kitschy temple and floating market off the beaten path.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-tha-ka-rong,"Situated on the banks of the Chao Phraya river away from the tourist centre of Ayutthaya, Wat Tha Ka Rong, aka The Temple of the Blackbird or the Monastery of the Landing of the Crying Crow, is an unexpected novelty away from the of the main city centre. Formerly a campsite for Burmese troops in the White Elephant War, it is made up of a temple, Wat Tha, and a monastery, Wat Ka Rong. The site dates back to around the mid-16th century. Although still a working religious site, Wat Tha Ka Rong is an assault on the senses, it’s unique blend of colour, kitsch and sometimes downright crazy, meaning that it really should be a must see on anyone’s list when visiting Thailand’s former capital. Imagine a temple, crossed with a British seaside amusement arcade, add about 72491 animal/superhero statues and you have some idea of this place looks like—and that’s before you get to the floating market. The floating market at the temple offers some of Thailand’s best loved dishes at super cheap prices— think plates of Pad Thai, Moo Satay (pork with peanut sauce) and Som Tam (papaya salad). After gorging yourself on food, head down to the side of the river and buy bags of fish food that looks like colourful polystyrene pieces. Here you can throw them to the catfish who climb all over each other just to get a scrap. And not to worry if you need to use the bathroom here, thanks to it’s innovative design, Wat Tha Ka Rong also proudly boasts the Thailand ‘Best Toilet Award.’ At the time of writing, Wat Tha Ka Rong is mostly frequented by locals and there aren’t that many visitors from outside of Thailand, meaning that this temple offers a much more authentic experience than Ayutthaya’s main tourist-orientated floating market. Another plus point of Tha Ka Rong is that it does not offer the dubious animal attractions of it’s larger competitor, which can be challenging viewing for the average western traveller. Wat Tha Ka Rong is open all week, but to see all of it’s attractions it is best to go on a weekend, as this is when the floating market is open. Before Bangkok, Ayutthaya was the capital city of Thailand and is still a popular tourist destination. Therefore, it is very easy to get to. A bus from Mo Chit or Victory Monument will set you back around 80 – 100 Thai Baht and takes less than two hours. If you’re looking for a scenic journey, the train from Hualamphong station takes 2.5 hours and is even cheaper – only 22 baht. Ayutthaya is also very easy to reach from other cities in Central Thailand.Once you arrive in Ayutthaya, the most popular way to see the attractions is by bike. Wat Tha Ka Rong isn’t on all of the tourist maps, but locals will be happy to add it for you. If cycling isn’t your bag, tuk-tuks are all around the centre of Ayutthaya, and you should be able to get to the Temple for around 200 baht.",markets temples food
231,Baan Dam - Black House,"Nang Lae, Thailand","An entire elephant skeleton, snake skin table runner, and thousands of animal remains become art in Thailand's Black House.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/black-temple,"Everything at Baan Dam is black, or at least gives off a dark aura, and each one of the 15 houses is embellished and furnished with animal remains. Artist Thawan Duchanee created an impressive collection of skins, bones, teeth and taxidermy of a wide array of animals. The animal remains are intricately arranged, giving off a beautifully unique yet mysterious tribal vibe. There is a conflict of emotion, between appreciation of art and a sense of evil, coming from the dead animals. Supposedly they all died from natural causes; an idea that makes the place more spiritual and less sadistic. The main temple is a large wooden structure. The black tiered roof has curvy metal points jutting from the sides. Inside, the wooden infrastructure is aesthetically exposed. In the center a long wooden table with benches on both sides is lined with an incredibly long snakeskin runner. One hut, designed like a Budhist stupa, contains a circular room, lined with chairs made of buffalo horns and skin. The centerpiece is a giant crocodile skin, painted black and surrounded by candles. The room is known to reverberate and amplify sound. Maybe the most fascinating and sadistic architecture is the submarine-shaped building. Like most of the buildings, it is not open for entry, but windows provide ample light to view its contents, revealing what seems to be a torture chamber. Baan Dam is Thawan Duchanee’s artful portrayal of hell. The opaque decor and dead animals adorning each room make Duchanee’s estate the complete opposite of the White Temple, the glimpse of heaven designed by his teacher Chalermchai Kositpipat.  Although off the beaten track, the Black Temple is not something to be overlooked. Renting a motorcycle or scooter will be the easiest way here (though directions via bus are below). From Chiang Rai’s Central Plaza or the Princess Mother’s Garden, head north on route 1 (Phaholyothin road). After crossing the Kok river (just north of the Princess Mother’s Garden), go 8.4 kilometers – you’re looking for a brown wooden sign and a brown wooden awning on the left. This will have three lines of Thai text and the number 13 (for Moo 13, the side street number). Take the left just before the sign, then go about 450 meters – you’re looking for the first left turn that isn’t someone’s driveway. Next, go 300 meters – you’ll see some of the sights on the left and a parking lot on the right.If taking the bus, start from the central bus terminal (near Phaholyothin and Prasopsook’s intersection, GPS: 19.904716,99.834222) and ask around to find the right bus (most likely, around platform 5 or 6). Note you’ll want to use the Thai name (Baan Dam) – asking around for the Black House here is likely to elicit puzzled looks. The locals know this place, and will get you off the bus at the right time. If you’re playing along with a smartphone, of course, tap the GPS coordinates and follow the bus as it goes north. Once you’re off the bus, hopefully near the side road, follow the directions as above. Expect the bus to take about 30 minutes.",hunting and taxidermy taxidermy outsider architecture collections

At the end of the cavern lies a stalagmite that resembles a woman holding a child. In front of that is a stalactite shaped like a heart. A legend says a woman once stood here waiting for her lover to return, and when he he did, she turned to stone. Some say the woman is Princess Aranyani who fled with her child to protect her lover, who was a commoner. There are also two colorful Buddha shrines in the cave, which was formed millions of years ago from the limestone in that region. Today the walls are illuminated by multicolored lights which bathe the limestone in bright colors. The cave is especially popular during the Songkran celebration in mid-April. During this time, a festival is held in the cave. However, it is important to note that the cave is mostly submerged during the rainy season. It is best to visit in the dry season if you want to walk the full length of the cave. This site can be reached only by car. It is about 40km north of Phray City. Drive along Highway 101 at km 59.

Known formally as Mahaminh Sakayamunee Visejchaicharn, informally as Phra Buddha Maha Nawamin, and simply as the Big Buddha, Wat Muang’s Buddha stands at an eye-watering 92 meters tall and 63 meters wide. Completed in 2008, the enormous statue towers above the surrounding, sparsely populated farmland. As the original Wat Muang was destroyed during the ransacking of the former Thai capital Ayutthaya by the Burmese in the 18th century, the temple’s exact origins are unknown. After years of work, the reconstruction of Wat Muang was completed in 1982. In 1990, work started on the Big Buddha and was completed 18 years later, costing around 131 million Thai Baht (around $3.75 million). The giant concrete structure is finished with gold paint and casts its shadow over not only the Wat Muang monastery and temple, but also the surrounding “Hell Garden” featuring statues depicting various scenes from Buddhist Hell. Other nearby sculptures on display memorialize the Gods and Kings and Thailand and commemorate events from the Burmese-Siamese War. As well as the garden, visitors can enjoy the Viharn Kaew (glass ordination hall), a chamber decorated from floor to ceiling with mirrored mosaic tiles that houses a Buddha made of solid silver. As Ang Thong is a region in Thailand that plays host to a small amount of tourists compared with the likes of Bangkok, Chiang Mai and the Southern Gulf, it can be quite difficult to get to Wat Muang. From Bangkok (116km away) or Ayutthaya (44km away) it is best to take a minivan (this is a very common way for people Thais to travel) and ask to be dropped off in Ang Thong. From Ang Thong, it is then possible to rent a car or a motorcycle to complete the remainder of the journey by taking the A 3064 and A 3195 west, a journey of less than 20 minutes from Ang Thong center. The Buddha dominates the skyline and can easily be seen from the road.",giant buddhas buddhism statues

A limestone cliff rises abruptly next to a clearing, where you’ll find a cave of fish, crocodile pond, ancient monument, Buddhist Hell statues, and many many monkeys. At the cave, Tham Pla, a stream of fresh water forms a pond that extends outside the cavern. As the name suggests, it has plenty of fish swimming in it. Not far from there, an artificial enclosed pond is home to some crocodiles. (Unfortunately a sad sight as the enclosure is obviously too small.) But neither the fish nor the crocodiles dominate the scene. Macaques do. A troop of irascible macaques wields supreme power over the whole compound—so much so that this location is sometimes referred to as the “Monkey Temple.” Street vendors offer snacks and drinks on the main clearing, from which the ordination hall can be seen. The backdrop of the hall is an ancient monument with graceful decorations—the line of canaries is particularly beautiful. Adjacent to the ordination hall are some cartoonish statues portraying scenes from Buddhist Hell. A weathered stairway adorned with two nagas (mythological snakes) leads to a shrine inside the cave. Go beyond the shrine and you’ll find narrow, slippery passages with bats fluttering around your head, and the smell of guano filling your lungs. Follow these passageways to get to recesses with creepy paintings lurking in the dark. If the objective of these paintings was to evoke dread, they exceed expectations.  Wat Tham Pla is located in Ban Huai Poo Kaeng, a village about 12.5 miles (20 km) before Highway 1149 reaches the Thai-Myanmar border. Be extra careful around macaques, especially if you have anything in your hands. A stick is sometimes given to visitors to fend them off. Hiking boots are recommended for entering the cave. At times, you can find a monk sitting near the entrance lending lanterns to visitors, but to be on the safe side, you should bring your own torch.",monkeys shrines buddhism paintings temples caves ecosystems sacred spaces statues

After climbing a short staircase on the Western edge of the canyon hikers will see a narrow ridge of Earth, all that remains of a walking path through the canyon. Erosion on either side of the path has caused the forest level to drop dramatically with only the tips of the plants rising above the level of the path. With drops of up to 30 meters on either side of the strange trail, traversing it can be dangerous. The walk up to the first viewpoint is easily accessible to anyone even with a moderate level of fitness. However, the paths leading further vary widely in width, steepness, and danger. At points, the width of the land narrows to little more than foot wide ridges that must be scrambled across. At other points, the paths turns almost vertical and requires some climbing to go farther. Despite the slight dangers of the Pai Canyon it is a popular attraction in the region.  The entry to Pai Canyon is located on Road 1095. Going north, Pai Canyon is located 8 km. before entering Pai (town).Pai Canyon is the most popular spot in the area to watch the sunset. If you are hoping to avoid crowds, don't come at this time.

Unless, of course the gods had decided to adorn the entire island with precious stones. Which according to Thai mythology, they did. Precious, indeed, because the Gods—precisely the god of Tarutao, a Thai deity—is said to have placed a curse onto the island. Any visitor who would dared to take even a pebble off the island would be cursed forever. Each year the the National Park office which manages the island receives dozens of stones returned via mail, sent back by people who want to lift the curse. The stones of Koh Hingham must stay on Koh Hingham or you risk the wrath of Tarutao. Even though you cannot take the stones home, you can play with them within the boundaries of the island for as long as your inner child wishes to do so. Thai people, for example, use them to build miniaturized cheddis and kneeling in front of them, they lay their most ardent wishes and prayers.

The World Museum of Insects and Natural Wonders is the work of husband and wife team Manop Ratana Rittirong Gul, and Rattana Rumpa Rittirong Gul, both former contributors to the Smithsonian. Rattana is a world leader in mosquito research and has contributed almost 500 species of mosquito to the world record, while her husband is a malaria expert. Together they are a husband and wife bug superteam. The walls of their small, multi-floor museum are covered in glass frames full of pinned insects of all varieties including stick insects, beetles, butterflies, and more. Each of the displays is annotated both by scientific info and personal asides. In addition to the insectoid taxidermy, the museum features a number of surreal works of art by the duo. There are paintings of women and horses cavorting with giant mosquitoes and rocks that are described as the eyes and meteors. Together, the eccentric collection is both surreal and a bit creepy. The pieces of art are also given informational plaques, but they are mostly filled with personal bits of mysticism that relate to the making and meaning of the works. It’s not every museum that allows such an unvarnished look into the minds of its curators, and the combination of the clinical and personal at the site make for a strange, and unforgettable mixture.   72 Srimankalajarn Road Nimmanhemin Soi 13 Muang Chiangmai, Mueang Chiang Mai District, Thailand",bug week insects museums and collections museums

The swing was originally built in 1784, under the direction of King Rama I. Since then weather damage has required several restorations, including a recent renovation completed in 2007. For this project, workers used six massive teak tree trunks (each more than 20 meters tall and approximately 200 years old) to construct a new swing. For centuries, the Giant Swing played a central role in annual swing ceremonies that symbolically reenacted elements of Hindu origin stories. In Hindu mythology Brahma tested the stability of the newly created world by ordering Shiva to stand on a mountain while giant snakes tried to shake him to the ground. The swing ceremony had teams of Thai men in elaborate headdresses competing to launch themselves into the air, where they would use their teeth catch a sack of coins tied to the top of a pole 25 meters (or more) above the ground. The stability of the swing and presumed success of the swingers represented the unshakable Shiva of Hindu legend. Unfortunately, the ceremony was discontinued in 1935 after several participants fell to their deaths. In 2005 the Giant Swing and Wat Suthat were nominated as a future UNESCO World Heritage Site.",rites and rituals architectural oddities architecture

At Jok’s Kitchen, there’s no menu. Rather, make a reservation a month or two in advance, and Mr. Jok himself will decide what you’ll eat for dinner. While Jok’s backstory is a bit of a mystery, rumor has it that he grew up in a family of successful Thai-Chinese seafood exporters, giving him access to the greatest seafood restaurants in Bangkok. He picked up bits and pieces of culinary expertise from chefs until, as an adult, he’d attained somewhat of a mastery over Thai-Chinese seafood. After the crowds have cleared the wet market in Bangkok’s Chinatown, one light stays on: Jok’s original family shophouse, where he curates nightly meals for a small batch of lucky gourmands. Warning: The food does come out fast, so make sure your whole party is on time. Again, you won’t need to order anything, but you may need to ask directions when winding through the often unmarked streets of Bangkok’s Chinatown. While no two nights repeat themselves at Jok’s, fried gingko nuts, pickled mustard greens, or Cantonese wontons often commence the meal. Smoked duck, prawn-topped spicy lemongrass salad, prawn dumplings, or Thai-curried sea-crab may greet you as the meal gains momentum. The evening frequently climaxes with a larger main of grouper and plum soup, deep-fried cod, stir-fried kale with salted halibut, or, the crowd favorite, shelled giant crab with a selection of East Asian dipping sauces. Whatever hits the table, it’s important to know that indulging in this level of clandestine culinary finesse doesn’t come cheap.

They are bats, thousands upon thousands of them emerging to hunt insects as they do every night here in eastern Thailand. Along the rolling landscape, low and craggy cliffs rise from rice and manioc fields. Over eons the limestone outcrops of these cliffs have been eroded into labyrinthine tunnels and caves. This unusual karst topography has created the ideal refuge for many thousands of bats. Feeding on an ample supply of insects in this agricultural region, they act in many ways as a natural form of biological pest control. Revered and respected by villagers, some of the bat caves are even honored by monks. Below one monastery, giant statues of the Buddha seated in the lotus position gaze out of the inky darkness. Overhead, hundreds of bats chirp and jostle in their roost, sleeping away the day in anticipation for the night hunt. On the edge of Khao Yai National Park you can visit these caves and watch from the fields as the bats emerge to hunt at twilight. At first, only a faint trickle of black shapes is discernible from the cliffs, but soon a huge and unmistakable river of bats weaves over the fields like a snake. Like one living creature, the bats contort as a school of tiny fish might from the narrow opening of this cave system. At the entrance to the cave, raptors congregate in anticipation of an easy meal. As they dive toward the bats, the line opens and separates before joining together again in a twisting ribbon. This spectacle occurs for hours every night before the last bats exit the caves. Established in 1962, the second largest National Park in Thailand, Khao Yai is located about four hours from Bangkok in Thailand’s Nakhon Ratchasima Province.

Almost three decades ago, one monk and his acolytes had grown tired of the mounting litter in the Sisaket area near Cambodia. To promote recycling and cleaning the landscape, the monks encouraged everyone in the area to bring them recycled beer bottles to create a temple complex. Using mostly green Heineken  and Chang beer bottles and brown Leo (the local favorite) beer bottles, the monks began with a temple and later formed a crematorium, water towers, sleeping quarters and even toilets. Pushed into the concrete of the walls, the recycled bottles form every detail of the buildings inside and out. Aside from whole bottles, the monks also incorporated bottle caps to create mosaics and Buddhist designs inside of the temple. Today, the monks have no plans to stop building.

Pu was born in 1932 in Laos, and became a mystic early in his life. According to his legend, he fell through a sinkhole onto his teacher’s lap, and remained there for many years learning as much as he could. Although Pu was never ordained as a monk, by the end of his life he had amassed a solid group of religious followers and was recognized as a spiritual leader. To express his spiritual feelings, he began work on a sculpture park in Laos, until he left the country in 1974, which some attribute to the communist presence in Laos at the time. Moving across the border to Thailand, Pu purchased land in Nong Khai and began a project that would take him 20 years to complete. Crafting sculptures of all kinds, Pu attempted to tell the myths and legends of both Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. Some of his sculptures are 100 feet high, and tend towards depicting the frightening and grotesque, as evidenced by his skeleton sculptures and snake statues that are prevalent in the park. Each sculpture was carefully designed with a purpose in mind. Many visitors are especially struck by his work representing the life cycle. People enter into a birth canal, where statues depict life from conception to death. Designed as a circle, the wheel of birth and rebirth continues forever unless one is able to escape the cycle through nirvana. As he got older, Pu was still set on overseeing his work, and was brought to the park in a wheelbarrow to supervise. In 1996, Pu’s health was failing, and after an accident falling from one of his statues, he passed away. Today his mummified body is preserved and on display on a third-floor shrine in the park, which also houses pictures of him and some of his personal belongings.",outsider art monuments statues

Like a giant red bowl lined with yellow spotted petals, Rafflesia exude a strong smell that is similar to what you might expect to find near long-rotting carcasses. Not pollinated by insects seeking nectar, Rafflesia is believed to be pollinated by flies. The flowers are endoparasites that require the presence of Tetrastigma (wild grape vine) hosts, without which they will not grow. The Rafflesia was first noted by British naturalist Joseph Arnold, and named for the leader of the expedition, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. The Rafflesia arnoldii was later named in Arnold’s honor. It has since been named the official flower of Surat Thani province, but habitat losses and collection by humans are causing numbers to dwindle. The cooked buds or flowers of the Rafflesia can be used to help fever or a backache or even as a sexual stimulant, however, western medicine doesn’t recognize any medical use for the flower. The largest species of Rafflesia, Rafflesia arnoldii, does not grow in Thailand, but three other large species do - and they are celebrated by the national park, where they can be found in abundance.

Most of the counterfeit goods are used as evidence in intellectual property court cases before making their way into the museum. While the museum collection consists of roughly 3,500 confiscated items, there is only enough space to show 500 at a time. The counterfeit items range from brand name clothing and accessories (Gucci, Ed Hardy, Adidas, etc.), to food products, toys (such as Dragon Ball Z figurines), cell phones, books, and even automobile parts. The museum alleges that 95% of knock-off goods are made in China, and that an illegal shipment was once seized at the Thai border containing 150,000 pairs of shoes! Also on display are replica Casio calculators. For anyone going calculator shopping, keep an eye out for impostors – real Casio calculators do not have a CE button. Aside from sharing tips on spotting replica items, the guide also drives home the fact that counterfeit products can be dangerous. Automobile parts, food, or electronics with no safety testing or regulations can be disastrous. Ironically, upon leaving the museum, one needs to walk no more then a few blocks before encountering counterfeit goods. As it is in a working law office, the museum accepts guests by appointment only.",hoaxes crime and punishment collections museums and collections museums
247,Mummy of Luang Pho Dang,"Surat Thani, Thailand",Self-mummified monk who wears sunglasses and has become a gecko hatchery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mummy-of-luang-pho-dang,"After he died at 79 years old while meditating, the Buddhist monk Luang Pho Dang was closed in a glass coffin and left in his mudra pose with his legs folded, lotus style. Over 20 years later, his body remains incredibly well-preserved. In death, the self-mummified monk is housed in the charming Thai town temple of Wat Khunaram on Ko Samui Island in Thailand. Monks at the temple put sunglasses over the mummy’s sunken, empty sockets in order to make him less disturbing to visiting children and others who come to pay their respects. Radiographs of the mummy have revealed that he still wears his dentures and that in death he has become a hatchery for a native gecko species. The lizards lay eggs in his body cavities, beneath his leathery skin. His brain tissue and organ systems are remarkably intact, although small in size due to dehydration.

248,Wat Umong,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Buddha shrines hide within dark tunnels at this unique forest temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-umong,"In a city full of wats (Buddhist temples), Wat Umong is the most unique and least-visited in Chiang Mai. Tucked away on the western edge of town in the forested mountain foothills, this wat contains a network of centuries-old tunnels still used by Buddhist monks. Local lore states that the wat was founded in the 13th century by King Mangrai. The king regularly met with a monk in Chiang Mai, who preferred to meditate inside of a tunnel. As the city grew and the monk found it harder to find quiet refuge in his subterranean sanctuary, King Mangrai ordered a system of tunnels be built on the forested edge of town. Archaeological evidence and written sources conflict with this original legend. Instead, the style of painting within the tunnels as well as the architecture of the stupa above match the period between 1380-1450. This is supported by a written text called the Banha Thera Jan, which tells how King Kuena offered the monk Jan a position at Wat Umong and had the tunnels constructed for him. Soon, this network of tunnels had sprouted into a fully functioning temple. Wat Umong remained active until the 15th century, when it was mysteriously abandoned. In 1900, the stupa was broken and its relics looted. Reconstruction efforts began in 1948, including repairing the stupa and clearing dirt built up a meter high from the tunnel system. Unfortunately, this also destroyed many of the paintings that lined the tunnel walls. Today the wat is an active center, used by monks and locals. The tunnel system once again contains various shrines. There’s also a large, somewhat rare statue of the fasting Buddha sitting atop one of the tunnels and hiding among the trees. The forest is dotted with Buddhist sayings nailed to trees and old, decaying statues of the Buddha are scattered about the grounds. Visitors to Wat Umong will also find a pretty lake, a spiritual center, a small museum, and lots of chickens roaming around.  The wat is a few miles outside of the old town. You can use a taxi, songathew, tuk tuk, or bicycle to get there. If you pay someone to drive you there, arrange for them to wait while you explore the grounds, as this is not a popular tourist spot and return transportation will not be easy to find. Please dress conservatively and act respectfully, in accordance with local customs, as this is an active wat.",buddhism tunnels temples subterranean sites religion sacred spaces
249,The Abandoned Bangkok Mansions,"Tambon Phra Prathom Chedi, Thailand",Abandoned mini-mansions that were once intended for affluent Bangkok families now sit empty.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-abandoned-bangkok-mansions,"Rising from a moist field on a patch of land just outside of Bangkok, five blotched concrete mini-mansions have sat abandoned for over 20 years.  The mansions were once part of a planned upscale subdivision construction project to build homes for the wealthy in the quiet suburb of Nakhon Pathom, just a stones-throw away from the bustling capital city. These abandoned homes are one of many casualties of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, with the construction company filing for bankruptcy mid-build.  The 300 rai (120 acres) of land surrounding the homes has become more expensive in recent years, its price has skyrocketed after the 2011 floods.  The area was proven to not be affected by floodwaters that ravaged the region, deeming it a safe location to construct homes & businesses. The houses meant for the affluent, now host two families of modest means who have been living rent-free as caretakers of the property for the past 15 years. The company that owns the site provides the caretakers with free electricity & water, along with a small monthly stipend. The caretaker families occupy two of the houses nearest the road, while the three others in the back of the property, including the largest with a pool and wet-bar, remain boarded up and unoccupied. According to the patriarch of one family, the uninhabited dwellings are seen as haunted, with the families keeping clear of them for the most part. The people there are very kind & welcoming, common traits of many ‘everyday’ people living in rural areas across the Kingdom. The family members happily go about their daily routines of washing up, preparing food, playing with pets, and doing some motorbike maintenance. The interiors are sparse of furnishings, aside from basic necessities, but the inhabitants live pleasantly with plenty of living space for their extended families.  The abandoned Bangkok mansions are on private property and currently home to families acting as caretakers. While the mansions can be admired from afar, it is not encouraged to trespass.",
250,Bo Sang Umbrella Village,"San Kamphaeng, Thailand","Peek into the world of those creating the beautiful, delicate paper parasols found all over the globe.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bo-sang-umbrella-village,"Just outside the tourist paradise of Chiang Mai, Thailand lies the small craft village of Bo Sang (sometimes spelled “Bor Sang”), famous for its handmade paper umbrellas whose brilliant designs are mysteriously, magically impervious to rain. A trip to Bo Sang allows visitors a rare glimpse inside the delicate process of making these brilliant, artfully decorated umbrellas that have become instantly recognizable the world over. Once coveted by fair-skinned, delicate ladies for as protection from the sun, today none of their value has been lost even as tanned skin has grown to dominate the fashion world. For the wary, let it be known that a trip to Bo Sang is anything but an Upton Sinclair-esque look at the harsh reality behind something beautiful. Rather, the curious can wander through a town whose entire purpose seems to have united in the proud creation of lovely paper umbrellas. By the end of the day, a portrait emerges of how these meticulously hand-painted final products are assembled from piles of bamboo struts and sheets of paper made from mulberry bark. Of course, visitors are given the option to purchase umbrellas from the village gift shop after wandering around. A further, additional opportunity exists for one of the skilled, local artisans to hand-paint a customized design of your choosing on various items such as fans, mobile phone covers, purses, etc. The Bor Sang Umbrella Festival, held every January, enlivens the village with festivities. A parade streams through the village’s narrow main street, led by dancers and bicyclists (all wielding umbrellas, obviously), including the cycle-mounted contestants competing in the Miss Bo Sang Beauty Pageant, whose winner is crowned at the culmination of the festival.",villages festivals shops
251,Wat Pa Thewapithak,"Tambon Pa Fa, Thailand","The skeletons, demons, and corpses serve as a warning of the terrors of Buddhist Hell.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-pa-thewapithak,"Wat Pa Thewapithak, a hellish amusement park located at a Buddhist temple, isn’t the only terrifying theme park of its kind. There are Buddhist Hell parks in Singapore, in Vietnam, and all throughout Thailand. Many of the parks are operated by Buddhist temples, where they function as a cautionary tale. Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike visit the hell parks to see the torture that awaits them in the next life in Naraka, the realm of hell where the worst of the worst spend eons as retribution for bad karma. If the generally terrible quality of the statuary isn’t enough to frighten you by itself, perhaps its depictions of all the tortures of the hell awaiting unfaithful believers will do the trick. Witness skeletons, demons, corpses, and other monstrosities; behold a variety of tortures (eyes gouged out, entrails spilled, limbs hacked off, torsos impaled). Each gruesome diorama has a small box where, at the insertion of a 1 baht coin, tinny screams, macabre laughter, and sonorous diatribes will blast from a small loudspeaker. Some of the dioramas are even automated, as the 1 baht coin will also activate motors that will jerkily tug the highly visible strings attached to the statues. While there are large and presumably educational banners posted frequently throughout the park, those unable to read Thai will find them unhelpful. Even more unfortunately, caged animals are kept in dark, dingy corners. The miniature Angkor Wat labyrinth, on the other hand, is well worth the 90 seconds it takes to duck through its child-size doorways, as it is strewn with some decent recreations of Apsara’s and other Buddhist and Hindu iconography, as well as, for an unknown reason, the bust of a stoic Native American chief. As with all tourist attractions in Thailand, food and drink vendors abound on site. Wat Pa Thewapithak is a easily visible on the West side of highway 216 running North from the city of Roi Et. It's about 8km North of the city limits; there is no transit available, but if you have a motorbike you will see its brightly coloured walls and gate after about a 10 minute drive. It will be recognizeable as it is really on the highway; you do not need to follow a turn off at all. There is also a small cluster of statues right inside the entrance thanking visitors for coming and welcoming them to the area. You can get a taxi or tuktuk from the city but it would be wise to negotiate for them to wait for you and bring you back as there are no tuktuks waiting there or in any nearby areas. 200 baht should be the absolute upper limit for a full return journey. If you're quite adventurous you can walk it, but the highway is busy with a lot of traffic. The shoulder is wide and paved but there are often dogs along the side of the road who have varying degrees of friendliness towards pedestrians.",religious parks torture theme parks amusement parks buddhism temples religion sacred spaces
252,Elephant Building,"Bangkok, Thailand",This Bangkok high-rise looks like a rudimentary LEGO elephant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-building,"Elephants have played a central role in Thai society for many centuries. So when someone decided to build a high-rise in the shape of an elephant in Bangkok’s business district, well, it seemed like a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Bangkok is home to more than 80 completed skyscrapers, a record surpassed by only a few other cities in the world. So for a high-rise building to get noticed, it has to be a little special. And in Thailand, few things are considered more special than elephants. Such was the thinking of engineer and real estate mogul Arun Chaisaree and architect Ong-ard Satrabhandhu when they decided to collaborate on a new building in the Chatuchak District of the Thai capital. Chaisaree, in particular, was well versed in all things elephant, having previously opened his own museum to exhibit his collection of more than 2,000 elephant-shaped art objects. The Elephant Building, also known as the Chang Building, was completed in 1997. It consists of three towers (A, B, and C) joined across the top by a horizontal band of residential suites. Two of the towers form the legs of the “elephant,” while the third represents its trunk. The towers contain 32 floors, reaching a total height of 335 feet. Further details add to the overall elephant effect. The tusks on either side of the trunk contain the offices of the building’s management company. Its eyes are two huge circular windows. Its ears are multistory balconies, and its tail, which runs down the “rear” of the building, is formed by 20 stories of smoked-glass enclosed rooms. Reaction to the Elephant Building has been mixed, especially internationally. CNN soon added it to its list of the world’s 25 great skyscrapers, arguing that “at the time of its completion it was cutting edge, offering high-tech offices, a shopping plaza and a floor of luxury residential suites.” Architectural Digest, meanwhile, has since listed it among the “31 Ugliest Skyscrapers in the World,” noting that “While playful in design, the structure does little to push the integrity of Thai architecture.” Still, it’s hard to hold a grudge against a blocky beast of a building. Especially when it’s a record holder, in this case the largest elephant-shaped structure in the world. This record was once held by Lucy the Elephant, a six-story elephant built in 1882 in Margate City, New Jersey. And while the Elephant Building is nowhere near as realistic as Lucy, it’s certainly much, much bigger.  The Elephant Building is located in the Chatuchak District in the northern part of Bangkok, Thailand. It can be seen from various parts of the city, but some of the best views are had from along the Vibhavadi Rangsit Expressway when coming into Bangkok from Suvarnabhumi Airport.",skyscrapers elephants world's largest architectural oddities architecture
253,Wat Tham Ta Pan,"Tambon Tham Nam Phut, Thailand",Grotesque statues of figures from Buddhist hell haunt the temple's Sin Park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-tham-ta-pan,"A small sculpture garden full of figures from Buddhist hell (Naraka) greets visitors who wander through Wat Tham Ta Pan. It’s a sinister sight, one filled with gory images of tortured beings and terrifying beasts. Wat Tham Ta Pan is a “heaven and hell” temple. At first glance, it seems like a fairly neglected site full of the usual animals, and deities. There are pleasant, peaceful scenes designed to represent heaven, but the Sin Park is what you’ll likely remember the most. It’s smaller than other hell temples found within Thailand, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less impressive—or disturbing. You begin the journey through heaven and hell by walking through the mouth of a massive dragon. You continue winding through the belly of the beast, down a dark, damp tunnel lit only by wisps of light that flit through the few windows. After passing through a cave meant to represent heaven, you’ll emerge at the entrance to hell. Once there, you’ll be greeted by maimed, tortured statues. Many of them are complete with vivid red touch-up paint to highlight their fresh wounds. Some are being speared or strangled, others are forced to climb up spiked trees. Some show hellish beasts as well. The gruesome scenes depict the eternal future that awaits sinners who fail to follow the Five Moral Precepts of Buddhism. It’s presumably designed to put the faithful on the path to good behavior by terrifying them. Some of the scenes depicted in the hell section are vivid and gruesome and are probably unfit for children to see. There's easy access by car, with parking out front. But it's probably a bit of a challenge to get to on public transport.",torture dragons sculpture gardens buddhism temples sculptures statues
254,Wat Arun,"Khwaeng Wat Arun, Thailand",This dazzling Buddhist temple was constructed from over one million ceramic tiles salvaged from a British shipwreck.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-arun,"Rising like a glittering palace over the western side of the Chao Phraya River, Wat Arun is one of Thailand’s most spectacular and oldest temples. The site is renowned for its colorful, glazed ceramic tiles (reportedly over one million of them) and its ornate central spire (or prang) that currently towers at over 260 feet (about 80 meters). What makes the temple particularly unusual is the origin of its tiles: they were originally broken bits of Chinese dishes that were salvaged from a British shipwreck. The found porcelain pieces were then crafted into ornate flower petals and embedded into the prang to produce a glittering effect under the sun. Named “The Temple of Dawn” during the Ayutthaya Period (1768), King Taksin came across the original site by boat after returning back from battle with the Burmese army. As he approached the city at sunrise, the king named the glittering spectacle after the Hindu god Aruna (who is the charioteer of the Sun god Surya). Later, King Rama III added the elaborate ceramic tiles, tiny seashells, Buddha statues, as well as its signature central pagoda spire. Despite its name, the full scope of Wat Arun is perhaps best appreciated at sunset from the river. While visitors can see temple’s design touches in detail by day (including several Buddha statues and four other spires), it’s particularly beautiful when lit up to a radiant, glowing silhouette at night. If you do, however, visit during the day, it’s best to arrive right when the gates open at 8:30am or late afternoon just before sunset. “Wat Arun’s full official name is Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan – but you’re never going to remember that, let alone pronounce it!,” Pintida Harnpanpongse of Tourism Authority of Thailand tells Atlas Obscura. “It’s considered as one of the most iconic, most recognizable, and most beautiful temples in Thailand because of its unique design, fine craftsmanship, colorful decorated spires, and its majestic riverside location that stands right across from Wat Pho (the Temple of Reclining Buddha).” The central tower (prang) is said to symbolize Mount Meru—the home of the gods in Hindu cosmology and the center of the physical and spiritual universe—with its grand tiered design that resembles a stairway to heaven. “Surrounding the Prang there are three rows of statues: on the bottom row there are demons representing hell, the middle row [depicts] monkeys and represent the earth, and the top row are angels representing heaven,” says tour guide Thippy Thepthewi. “The Prang was built with similarity to Khmer architecture, but actually it is our Thai Rattanakosin style, since its slimmer and taller with indentions in the corner (which differ from the Khmer style).” Wat Arun has also recently underwent an extensive three-year renovation to restore the Chinese porcelain tiles and seashells, as well as the base of the pagoda.  Wat Arun is open to the public daily between 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Entry is 50 THT for adults.",buddhism temples architectural oddities architecture

This peculiar structure is actually home to a five-story museum featuring information on both traditional Thai folklore and animal biology. Expect to see life-size replicas of the different species of toad while reading about Thai mythology and superstitions. Once you reach the top of the attraction, you’ll find yourself standing on a viewing platform in the toad’s mouth. This is the perfect time to gaze out upon the Chi river and take in the fresh views. If you’re wondering why a giant toad is this park’s main attraction, it all goes back a Thai belief. Phraya Khan Khak translates to “the Toad King,” a noble amphibian spirit whose presence is linked to rainfall. To pay their respects to this spirit, the Isan region of Thailand holds a yearly rocket festival in mid-July, coinciding with the pre-farming season. Niter-and-charcoal-filled rockets are fired into the air, asking the holy spirit to let the rain pour down from the heavens and ensure a bountiful harvest. So, next time you see a toad hop across your path, it may be forecasting the beginning of a storm! The giant toad is not the only attraction to check out. Be sure to grab a photo among the statues of dancing Isan women and relax in the quaint gardens nearby. Or, you could visit their other museum, which, this time, is inside a huge building shaped into a roaring, serpent-like creature.

256,Erawan Shrine,"Bangkok, Thailand",A shrine built to combat the bad karma of a commercial venture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erawan-shrine,"At the advice of a respected astrologer, the Erawan Shrine was built in 1956 around the same time as the construction of a nearby hotel to eliminate the bad karma believed to be caused by laying the foundations on an inauspicious date. Unhappy spirits were believed to be responsible for delaying the hotel’s construction by injuring the laborers and causing the loss of a shipment of Italian marble intended for the building. To add to the cacophony of angry ghosts swarming around the Ratchaprasong intersection, the government had historically executed criminals in the same place. A Hindu shrine was seen as a solution, and the hotel plans were modified to accommodate the devotional site. The shrine is named for Erawan, the Thai name for the white elephant who carries a Hindu god, but the focus of the site is the golden statue of the four-faced Brahma, Phra Phrom. Unfortunately, it wasn’t all peaceful good times at the shrine from then on. In 2006, a man later judged to be mentally unstable attacked the Brahma with a hammer. He was subsequently beaten to death by an angry mob. In 2015, a bomb at the shrine killed 20 and injured 125. It is suspected to have been planted by Turkish nationalists in response to the deportation of Turkish prisoners. Since then the statue and the shrine have been restored. You can see local Thais making merit to the statue with garlands, incense, candles, and even birds, and see a troupe of Thai classical dancers in costume.",execution hinduism bombs shrines hotels

Handcrafted by local villagers in the Mae Hong Son province, Boon Ko Ku So Bridge stretches over lush rice paddies and makes for one of the most picturesque mountain views in the region. With its opulent forest scenery with lush vegetation, Boon Ko Ku So Bridge is not only Insta-worthy, but it’s perfect for a meditative nature walk. The pliable bamboo bridge has a lively buoyancy to it as you walk along the handmade, 800-meter stretch. If you arrive before 8 a.m., you can also catch a glimpse of the early morning alms giving from local villagers to the Buddhist monks. When the villagers give alms to the monks, they bring a variety of small dishes, including individual portions of spicy chicken curry and vegetables, white rice, and a local dessert all wrapped and steamed inside the sacred pandan leaf. In the early morning hours, the area isn’t tourist-heavy, so you’re sure to get some nature time for yourself and find your own zen, too. There’s a small temple on the bridge, as well as a flower swing for a photo opp with a backdrop of the mountains. There’s also a coffee shop right on the bridge, which artfully prepares its locally sourced beans.  This raised walkway is best to visit during the rainy season in Northern Thailand, which runs from June through October. If you go during the off-season, the rice fields will have already been harvested or dried up. While you’re there, be sure to check out the Pam Bok waterfall and swimming hole. It’s important to dress modestly out of respect for both the villagers and the monks when visiting the bridge. And if you happen to come on an alms giving day/time, remember that it’s considered impolite for women to directly touch Buddhist monks. The temple is only open for visitors on Buddhist holidays, but there are a few straw alcoves on the bridge for your own meditative practice in nature.",woodwork monks buddhism temples bridges

Sea water is pumped into the fields and is allowed to gradually evaporate during the dry season between January and April. When the water disappears and leaves behind dazzling white crystals, laborers step in. The work is backbreaking and labor-intensive. Women are typically engaged in scooping the salt into baskets.

Inland from the lovely beaches that generally attract visitors to the island is the strange art garden known as The Kingdom of Somchai’s Affection. The naked, and often suggestively posed figures in the garden are the work of local artist Khun Somchai who created the sexualized figures long before the tourists came to the island. Exaggerated breasts and female genitalia are on full display in the garden, abstracted by the stone forms, but nonetheless sexualized. Many of the figures are configured as tables or strange fountains, but this generally serves to make the figures seem even more submissive. The naked art figures are found in a patch of woods down a stone path, the overgrowth obscuring some of the more lurid works in the collection from innocent passersby.

The Lang River (Nam Lang) runs through the entire length of the cave, from one side of the mountain to the other, and the only way to explore the long cavern is to hire a rickety bamboo raft and a local guide with a gas lantern. Upon arriving at the entrance of the cave, it is obvious that you are not the first visitor to get here, but once you get inside the cave, the utter lack of artificial lights and permanent facilities adds a certain sense of adventure. In no time, stalactites and stalagmites put up a show that took millions of years to form. At different points of the trip, depending on the time of the year, guides stop to let visitors step on the muddy ground and slippery bamboo passageways to get a closer look at the rock formations, which can exceed 65 feet in height. As the end of the trip approaches a shaft of light cuts through the darkness, and the emerald green of the vegetation outside can be blinding. The opening at the end of the cave is huge and thousands of birds dart in all directions.  The chirping can be deafening, but it is an impressive sight. The Lawa people used to bury their dead inside caves, and at one point 1,400-year-old coffins were found inside Tham Lod. You won’t be able to see the coffins upon visiting, but archaeological excavations in the area have proved that Tham Lod was used as a burial place by the Hoabinhian people between 5,500 and 9,000 BC.

The temple complex is majestic, dazzling, serene, and perhaps a bit amusing all at once. Here, every available surface is drenched in gold and bedecked with ornate mirrored tiles the color of precious jewels. A wide skirt of steps flanked by two sinuous emerald dragons leads straight to the towering central figure: a 12-meter-tall golden Buddha. It sits atop a hill overlooking the stunning aquamarine waters surrounding the tiny islet of Koh Faan. Sitting in Mara pose, this Buddha represents a state of enlightenment, purity and calm. Reflecting these principles, a ring of large bronze prayer bells encircles the Buddha, gently swaying in the cool ocean breeze. Use one of the provided wooden strikers to lightly ring each bell for good luck as you take in the glorious views. In the early mornings, one can observe monks chanting their morning prayers as well as locals who bring offerings of food, incense and flowers. Be sure to pop into a few of the stalls surrounding the base of the temple during your visit. Local street food, fruit, flowers and fun souvenirs can be found aplenty. Neaby Chaweng Beach, Wat Plai Lem and Ang Thong National Marine Park are popular stops to check out during your visit as well.

Perhaps for this reason the Bank of Asia was so delighted by Sumet’s proposal, and eagerly began construction of the Robot Building. Completed in 1987 at a cost of US$10 million, the 20-story building was initially the tallest building in the major commercial district of Sathorn. And while it no longer dominates the skyline, it remains one of the most recognizable towers in the city. The floors of the building decrease in area at regular intervals, creating the “body” of the robot. Two round windows on the top section (the head) resemble lidded eyeballs, giving the robot a cartoon-like—and slightly sleepy—appearance. To complete the effect, Sumet added antennas on the roof, which serve as both communication masts and lightning rods, while the sides of the building are adorned with large metallic-looking nuts, the largest measuring 12.5 feet in diameter (You can see a 3D model of the structure here). The building was later selected by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles as one of the 50 seminal buildings of the century. It has its detractors, of course, but then who doesn’t? And for many people, especially those not overcome by cynicism, the idea of having a giant toy robot standing in the middle of a city is just plain fun. Even if it does contain a whole bunch of bankers.  The Robot Building is located at 191 South Sathorn Road in the Sathorn District of Bangkok. It is currently occupied by the United Overseas Bank (which acquired Bank of Asia in 2005) and serves as their Bangkok headquarters. You can get there by taking the BTS Skytain to Chong Nonsi, which is a short walk from the building. You can also see it while traveling on the Skytrain. You’ll see it on your left just after leaving Chong Nonsi station if you’re on the Silom Line heading to Saphan Taksin, or on your right after leaving Surasak station from Saphan Taksin heading towards Siam or National Stadium.",robots buildings architectural oddities architecture

265,House of Opium,"Wiang, Thailand",A small museum in the Golden Triangle tells the story of the opium drug trade that gripped Northern Thailand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-opium,"The House of Opium, in the town of Sop Ruak in the Chiang Rai province of Northern Thailand, is everything you ever wanted to know about opium but never dared ask. This small museum is located right on the Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia, the area where Thai, Lao and Myanmar borders converge. The region is known for being one of the world’s two largest producers of opium, along with Afghanistan in the Golden Crescent. The museum was founded by Patcharee Srimatyakul in 1990. Born in the area, Patcharee had a passion for collecting opium paraphernalia and memorabilia. When she noticed that opium items were becoming extremely hard to find — with Thailand cracking down on the illegal drug trade — she turned the collection into a museum open to the public. The exhibits display tools and objects used to plant, harvest and trade opium, including pipes, scales, weights, knives, scrapers. It also includes some lovely poppy flowers, the source of opium production. The bulk of the opium cultivation was done by hill tribes in the Golden Triangle, as the drug trade offered a good source of income for farmers otherwise living it poverty. Alongside the objects in collection, the museum provides interesting information and old photographs related to the production and consumption of opium, and the drug’s impact on the lives of the hill tribe people. There are two museums located in the Golden Triangle area related to opium. The larger, up in the hills, is called Hall of Opium. The House of Opium is located in town, along the Mekong River. It's open daily from 7am-6pm. Admission fee is Baht 50.",drugs museums and collections museums
266,Phu Chi Fah,"Po, Thailand","This mountain sunrise is one of the most breathtaking views in Thailand, yet well off the tourist trail.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phu-chi-fah,"Phu Chi Fah is a must for anyone seeking the perfect sunrise experience. Located on the Thai/Lao border, this mountainous area is several degrees removed from the mass tourism Thailand is known for. It is quite far (almost 60 miles) from the nearest city, Chiang Rai, and there are hardly any other sights in the vicinity. And let’s not forget that in order to get to the peak before dawn, you need to wind up and down rural roads in the dark. Yet, it is well worth it. Once you’ve reached Phu Chi Fah before the sun rises, darkness begins lifting, and most days a thin layer of mist appears from the lowlands, forming a bed of fluff through which the higher hilltops peek through. This is the signature view of the Phu Chi Fah sunrise. Once the mist begins lifting, the view opens up, revealing forests, hills, valleys, farmland and the mighty Mekong River all the way to Laos and beyond. And above it all, colorful hues and shades turn the sky into an ever-changing work of abstract art. The beauty of the Phu Chi Fah sunrise appears in many tourist brochures and posters, but its name is rarely mentioned, which also goes to explain why so few visitors make it here—that is international visitors, as Thai locals are very fond of this place. The Phu Chi Fah viewpoint is the top of a steadily rising mountain that terminates abruptly with a dramatic drop. The most photogenic spot is just before you arrive at the top, so that both the cliff and the misty blanket are in sight.  Phu Chi Fah can be visited by staying at one of the hotels along the way there from Chiang Rai. Get acquainted with the rural roads the previous day so that reaching Phu Chi Fah in the dark is not as daunting. It can also be visited as a one-day trip from Chiang Rai, but that means setting off by 3 a.m. and navigating roads you’ve never been on. Either option requires your own means of transport. Phu Chi Fah can also be reached via public transport, but it is probably a 3-day trip, with the problem of getting to the top before sunrise—possible but difficult. The last 13 km to Phu Chi Fah are on Road 1093, which branches off from Road 1155 in an easterly direction. Road signs are not clear, so you may have to ask around. From the parking lot, which is also the end of the road, it’s an easy 15-minute hike (if you’re reasonably fit) to the viewpoint. Visit Phu Chi Fah on a weekday for a chance to have the place all for yourself.",sun panoramas hidden mountains nature
267,Chit Beer,"Koh Kret, Thailand","On a river island north of Bangkok, a small bar helped lead a home-brewing rebellion.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chit-beer,"To shelter two giant beer companies from competition, the 1950 Liquor Act made it effectively illegal to home-brew beer in Thailand. As such, most Thai craft breweries have been forced to manufacture abroad and import their beer back into the country, suffering heavy taxes to sell their product. On a tiny river island north of the country’s capital, however, one man has led a home-brewing rebellion, not only making his own beer for sale, but also training a new generation of Thai home-brewers. Amidst the sea of pallid, bland-tasting lagers that dominate the Thai beerscape, Chit Beer offers a flavor oasis. With a rotating menu of home-brewed IPAs, wheats, sours, and porters galore, there’s something for every beer-lover at this riverside, open-air bar—especially for those with a proclivity for subversion. For years, founder and brewer Wichit “Chit” Saiklao has run this rogue brewery and kitchen like an open secret. While the island of Koh Kret, 15 miles up the Chao Phraya River from Bangkok, is not the easiest to reach, those who venture there can find Chit Beers on tap as well as brewing classes (which are open by reservation, but usually booked out months in advance). While this means he has armed thousands of rebellious beer enthusiasts with the knowledge needed to subvert a corrupt Thai law, it also means he’s paid his fair share of fines to police. The brewery has enabled a supportive feedback loop whereby students of Chit’s tutelage who start their own micro-breweries are featured on draught at Chit Beer, giving young brewers the exposure and capital needed to grow their small, clandestine businesses. A former Thai army colonel who runs two IT companies and occasionally teaches electrical engineering at the Thai Royal Academy, “Chit” (pronounced “Sheet”) is a man of order with respect for the law. His bar and home-brewing school, however, have been a stand for common sense. The army man knows when an army is needed: As he told Draft in 2016, “We must create an army of home brewers. We will win when we have something unique … and it touches the tongue of someone in power.” One of his beers must’ve touched the right tongue: In 2018, Chit was granted a license to open the country’s first legal Thai craft brewery, Mitr Craft, and Mitr Bar, an outlet where he can legally sell his beer. The latter is located in Bangkok’s Victory Monument neighborhood. For those who want the original outlaw experience on the river island, however, he still maintains Chit Beer on Koh Kret.",thailand pub breweries beer rivers bars
268,Death Railway Bridge,"Ban Tai, Thailand",This bridge made famous in a novel and on-screen wasn't actually built over the river Kwai.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/death-railway-bridge-the-bridge-over-the-river-kwai,"There is a famous bridge in Thailand that crosses a river called the Khwae. It’s a destination for visitors of all kinds, including Europeans and Americans—who mostly have no idea they’ve been mispronouncing it for over 60 years. The river under the famous crossing is known to most westerners as the “Kwai,” thanks to the 1952 novel and 1957 movie version of The Bridge Over the River Kwai. The specific plot and characters are a fiction, but the underlying story is true, and the 500-foot span has become Thailand’s most visible and poignant remnant of a brutal chapter of World War II. The bridge is in the quiet, provincial town of Kanchanaburi, about 30 miles east of the Myanmar border. It was constructed during the War as part of the Thailand-Burma Railway, a transport system that came to be known as the “Death Railway,” its dark history bloodied by the nearly 100 thousand forced laborers and 16,000 prisoners of war who lost their lives during its construction. The historic bridge is a symbolic reminder of the harrowing cruelty suffered by the Allied POWs (some American, the majority English and Dutch) and the conscripted Southeast Asian laborers, all forced into service by the Japanese. The intent was to build a 250-mile railway as a supply route from Ban Pong in Thailand to Thanbyuzayat in Burma (now Myanmar). A project estimated to take up to five years was forced to completion in 16 months, and with it came unrelenting brutality, rampant disease, squalid conditions and workers’ rations barely above starvation. The bridge served its intended purpose for less than two years, when the railway was heavily bombed by the Allied forces in 1945. What was intended as a line to supply Japan and its plans to conquer further west, instead becoming an escape route for retreating Japanese troops. Control of the railway was divided between the British, who took the Burmese side, and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), who took the Thai side and what remained of the bridge. Although the stories of the novel and movie were inventions of Pierre Boulle and Hollywood, the bridge itself was an important part of the railway—it just didn’t happen to cross the Kwai (or Khwae, which is pronounced more like “kware”). There was no bridge over the Khwae—Boulle simply got his rivers mixed up. It’s the right bridge, but the river is the Mae Klong. So rather than change minds over the mistake, the government of Thailand simply changed the name of the river in 1960, rechristening this stretch as the Khwae Yai. The Bridge over the River Khwae Yai suffered heavy damage in the bombing, taking out all but the outer steel structure. It was rebuilt by the SRT, and has since been used for commercial and tourist travel. You can cross by rail car, or see this piece of history up-close on foot.  Kanchanaburi is about 75 miles northwest of Bangkok, and there are bus routes from Northern and Southern terminals (Mo Chit and Sai Tai Mai), and from Victory Monument. There are also busses from the nearby towns of Ratchaburi and Suphanburi. Travel by train is on the Bangkok Noi - Nam Tok line, and there are also packaged day trips from Bangkok to the Bridge and surrounding memorials and other World War II sites (e.g., the Allied War Cemetery, the Thailand-Burma Railway Centre Museum, and the JEATH War Museum). In the last week of November and the first week of December, sound and light shows commemorate the Allied forces attack on the Death Railway, and big crowds descend – so at this time in particular, plan your trip well in advance and book ahead to secure travel and accommodations. For the fictionalized version, the 1952 novel by Pierre Boulle is still in print, or you can check out the 1957 movie with William Holden and Alec Guinness.",film locations railroads film bridges world war ii military
269,Wat Mahabut,"Bangkok, Thailand",A shrine honoring a legendary ghost bride lies within this vibrant temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-mahabut,"This enormous temple has, at its heart, a captivating ghost story. Amid its colorful displays is a shrine dedicated to a legendary dead bride. According to the story, Mae Nak Phra Khanong was a beautiful woman with a deep, undying love for her husband, Mak. Mak was sent to war while Mae Nak was pregnant, not knowing he would never see his love again—at least, while she was still alive. Mae Nak and her unborn child perished during birth. But her husband did not realize what had happened after he returned from the war, as both his wife and child were still there waiting for him. Neighbors tried to warn him it was really their ghosts still lingering within the home, but Mae Nak ensured their attempts were thwarted. However, Mak eventually realized he’d been living among the ghosts of his dead family. He fled to Wat Mahabut, where the spirit of his lost lover could not reach him. Mae Nak terrorized the town in her anger and grief before being captured by an exorcist and contained in a jar. She eventually escaped but was again captured. Today, a shrine within the temple honors this storied ghost bride and her tragic tale. People seeking refuge from the bustle of Bangkok’s streets come to leave offerings at the shrine, as well as to release fish and turtles into the river.

Located roughly three to four hours from Chiang Mai by bus or car, Pai is known for its spiritual sites, including the White Buddha Temple. Perched high up on the mountainside in the Mae Hong Son Province, you can catch a glimpse of the elegant white statue from all around the city of Pai. Getting to the top, however, requires a bit of effort—353 steps, to be exact. In the rainy season, the walk up isn’t that bad—even if you’re not all that athletic. The key is to pace yourself as you ascend the stairs, especially under the hot sun at midday or when the humidity is high. Bring extra water along for the journey, just in case you get dizzy when you reach the top. You can buy beverages beforehand from a vendor at the base of the stairs. Once you’re at the top, you can catch lush views of the surrounding mountains and rice paddies, as well as a breathtaking sunset just behind the mountains. The White Buddha faces west, so you simply have to look back to see it. It’s also a particularly peaceful place at sunrise. Visitors can light candles in front of the White Buddha and meditate anywhere on the large tiled platform that surrounds its base.   Be aware that the temple enforces a very strict dress code: both men and women should not wear tank tops, revealing clothing, or shorts/dresses that go above the knee. If you already happen to be wearing a tank top (or something similar) for the day, just bring a sarong, wrap, or scarf with you to cover up as you ascend and descend the stairs. There’s no entry fee and the temple is open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. everyday. At the very bottom of the road that leads to the temple stairs is a must-try fresh, organic lunch spot called Earth Tone vegetarian cafe. There’s also a health shop/general store stocked with handcrafted tinctures, oils, and artisanal beauty products located inside the restaurant.",giant buddhas buddhism trails
271,Wat Phumin,"Pha Sing, Thailand","Riding on a pair of architectural dragons, this Thailand temple holds murals full of lurid imagery.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phumin,"Many visitors to Thailand have noted a certain amount of “temple fatigue”, visiting so many temples that at the end they all look the same and one can quickly lose interest in even the most intriguing among them. However the historic Wat Phumin Temple easily separates itself from the pack with its strange, NSFW murals of demons and domestics. Built in 1596, Wat Phumin is a uniquely designed temple meant to evoke the feeling that it is riding aloft on the backs of two huge serpents called “nagas.” Also unique to the temple are the four entrances which are aligned with the cardinal directions and are each attended by a Buddha statue inside of the temple. While the temple was established in the 16th century, the current exterior of the building actually dates back to the 1800s, as do the site’s treasured murals. On the inside of the building, covering nearly every wall are elaborate murals that were put in place during the temple’s 1800s restoration. The subjects of the murals are split between tales from the lives of the Buddha and simpler domestic representations, outlying life in the area during the 19th century. Among the historic paintings however are a number of shockingly graphic depictions of sexual misconduct and genital horror making the peacefulness of the site a bit circumspect. Regardless of the slightly lurid imagery, the Wat Phumin Temple is still a site to behold, and at very least it will definitely help raise an eye even among travelers who have seen enough temples for a lifetime.",buddhism murals temples architectural oddities architecture

However, the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 had other plans. When it made landfall, the entire region was forced to evacuate. After recovery efforts, the project was abandoned amidst disagreements between developers and the local government. The complex consists of several buildings built on top of a parking complex. The remains of a pool, guest rooms, conference rooms, and dining halls are all visible. The buildings are fascinating (and a bit frightening) to explore as they are desolate and incomplete. There are plenty of hazards such as half-finished staircases and random holes in the ground, so explore cautiously. The views from the top floors are spectacular.  Advice on entry: You can enter from the beach by scrambling up through the bottom floors of the parking garage, but it's not advised. There is a road that leads right up to the entrance on the top floors. Make sure you take several strong light sources if you plan on exploring the parking garage. Even in broad daylight, it's extremely dark and big holes litter the floor and are often filled with water. It's not wise to explore here alone. Wear appropriate clothing, between the rusty rebar and broken walls there are plenty of times you will want to be protected.

She lived out the rest of her days in the cave, awaiting her husband’s return. Today, local fisherman and boatmen leave offerings in Phra Nang cave to ensure safe travel on the sea. These offers take the form of male genitalia - the cave is covered in many “linga”, or phallic-shaped statues meant to represent the Hindu god Shiva. The offerings in Phra Nang cave are especially realistic - the penises have discernible ridges and heads. They are decorated with colorful cloth, and the cave is filled with incense.

There, a gargantuan chicken head rises from the turquoise depths. The great stone chicken watches over flocks of island hopping tourists like a mother hen would guard her chicks. Rather than feathers, it sports a coat of lush greenery. And though the rock’s resemblance to the head of a chicken with a mountainous hump behind it is the obvious attraction, so much more beauty lies beyond the odd poultry spectacle. Chicken Island is intriguing not only for many of the typical island reasons, but also for its slightly daring unpredictability. It’s an uninhabited and nearly pristine white sand beach that remains undeveloped, save for one little snack shack. Chicken Island deserves its own day of meandering. The beach is serene and peaceful. A visit at low tide will allow you to walk across a land bridge that appears seemingly out of nowhere and leads you to Tup Island, a smaller, sunnier island whose beach floods during high tide. The snorkeling here is some of the best in the area, with a wide variety of underwater life floating right past your mask. Sure, you’ll come across tour boats stopping for an hour so tourists can snap a picture of the quirky rock formation and snorkel the coral reef, but the area is largely untouched because of just how many other islands there are to explore.  It's about 30 minutes by boat from the west coast of Krabi. You can charter a boat from tourist services in Krabi. You can also take a boat from Ao Phra Nang Beach.

In fact, an elephant entrapment ceremony commenced within the kraal, and was attended by the kings of the era. This kraal is the only one left in Thailand. Elephants were once an invaluable commodity used for war, transportation service, and product export to India and Persia. Elephants from wild herds were captured by men riding tame elephants who used bamboo poles with leather nooses to ensnare the giant beasts. The captured elephants were herded into the kraal through a funnel in the back wall, and were separated for either domestic use or for exporting. The last round-up of wild elephants in Thailand was in 1903. The kraal is surrounded by a wooden gate with pillars that are easily moved as needed. Inside the gate is a huge brick wall enclosing large wooden pillars driven deep into the ground to log in the elephants.

A set of steep steps cuts through the limestone cliff and leads to the cave, within which is a small table with a statue of Buddha mounted on top. The statues by the temple depict monks praying with their hands covering their faces.

281,Democracy Monument,"Bangkok, Thailand",Bangkok celebrated its shifting monarchy with a militaristic homage to democracy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/democracy-monument,"In the center of Bangkok, Thailand, a rather beautiful monument tells a rather misleading story about the Siamese Revolution of 1932. There is no mistaking the Democracy Monument in Bangkok, with four wing-like structures extending 24 meters skyward surrounding a central monument featuring a stone-etched constitution. All of this is located at the center of a busy vehicular intersection making the site difficult to miss. Reliefs at the base of each wing show pro-military propaganda images, portraying Thai soldiers as protectors of the people and champions of an adoring democracy. Erected in 1939, the monument was meant to support the military regime which had taken control of the country during a coup d’état in 1932. While the soldiers on the monument are pictured doing battle for a prosperous Westernized future, the Siamese Revolution occurred without any bloodshed, taking place while the reigning monarch at the time, King Prajadhipok, was on holiday. Eventually the king was exiled and simply abdicated the throne. While the Democracy Monument may be pretty on-the-nose about its support of a militarily-established government, the landmark has been the site of several protests against later military regimes in 1973 and 1992. No matter the political baggage associated with the site, it remains an impressive work of regal, golden sculpture work, which is an aesthetic truth that would surely win any poll.

282,Solar Chicken,"Tambon Chong Sakae, Thailand","In Phetchaburi, Thailand, a roadside vendor cooks his fare with 1,000 mirrors and the power of the sun.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/solar-chicken-thailand,"In Phetchaburi, about two and a half hours south of Bangkok, roadside vendor Sila Sutharat offers chicken with a side of solar power in a grand, visual display. Using a curved wall of nearly 1,000 moveable mirrors, he concentrates sunshine onto a row of marinated chickens. Under the beams, sizzling a bird to perfection takes 12 minutes. The wall of mirrors saves money, pollutes less, puts on a good show, and—according to the inventor-chef—makes for more tender, evenly-cooked chicken. But beyond praise and patrons, the innovator’s device earned him an honorary science degree from a local university. On being asked about the distinction in an interview with Ozy, Sutharat replied with a smile, “I was so very proud, because I barely even finished fourth grade.” Sutharat designed and constructed the massive panels himself, after feeling the sun’s heat reflected onto him from a passing bus. Although he usually barbecued his gai yang, a popular Thai chicken dish, on a traditional charcoal grill, he decided to try harnessing the sun’s energy instead. At the time, fuel sources such as gas and petroleum had also become increasingly expensive, and wood suppliers were experiencing shortages. Over the last two decades, Sutharat has maintained his solar grill business by cooking for a mostly-local customer base. People from Thailand and farther afield only began flocking to his operation after videos of his apparatus in action went viral online. He now offers pork trotters, in addition to poultry.",prepared food markets and stores solar power street food inventions shops
283,Elephant Poo Poo Paper Park,"Tambon Mae Raem, Thailand",You'll never meet anyone this passionate about elephant droppings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-poo-poo-paper-park,"Chiang Mai’s Elephant Poo Poo Park brings a whole new meaning to eco-tourism. The interactive outdoor museum introduces visitors to the process of making paper from a rather unconventional source: elephant poo. Making paper from elephant poop is a sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to traditional tree-based products. By not using trees, it helps reduce deforestation and makes sure the abundance of animal waste isn’t wasted. The paper is entirely sanitary and stink-free. The process of transforming elephant poop into everyday paper is actually pretty straightforward. Once workers have scooped the poop and gathered it, they then wash the waste so that only the plant fibers remain. The fibers are then boiled and sanitized, then mixed with other non-wood pulp fibers. Finally, the intriguing mixture is screened and dried, just like typical wood-based paper has been for thousands of years. Visiting the Elephant Poo Poo Park gives people an up-close encounter with the whole process. You’re even invited to get involved, so be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. The park also has information about traditional paper making, which began in China nearly 2,000 years ago. In addition to the tour, people can check out the cafe and “poo-tique” to pick up souvenirs.  Tickets are 100THB per person, and if you show a songthaew driver the Thai address, they'll get you there no problem. Tours are available in English, Thai, and Chinese. It's probably a good idea to book ahead of time on their website.",paper elephants parks museums
284,Wat Nong Bua Yai,"Nong Bua, Thailand",An underwater temple submerged for 20 years has resurfaced with an extreme drought.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-nong-bua-yai,"Wat Nong Bua Yai may be the most unusual Buddhist temple in Lopburi province. The temple was hidden underwater for 20 years after the construction of the nearby Pa Sak Cholasit Dam. But its remains have returned to the surface due to an extreme, decade-long drought in central Thailand. Crumbling pillars supporting nothing, stone steps leading nowhere, a 13-foot headless Buddha statue, and other scattered ruins that were completely submerged during the rainy season can now be seen in full. (Check out this video to see some drone footage of the resurfaced temple.) The reservoir is down to just 4 percent of its normal water levels, and though the local people are well aware of the serious impact of the drought, the risen temple is seen as a place of good fortune. Lottery tickets are sold at the entrance, fish and birds can be purchased for merit-release, and entrepreneurs have opened shops to sell the usual snacks and drinks. The irony of this newfound visitor attraction isn’t lost on everyone, especially the local fishermen and farmers who have watched their means of earning a living recede with the water. According to Reuters, the dam originally helped irrigate 1.3 million acres of farmland. That’s now down to just 3,000 acres after the long drought.  The temple has gained a lot of local attention and these days is commonly packed with visitors.",weather underwater climate change lakes hidden temples water
