0,Great Blue Hole,Belize,A massive underwater sinkhole made famous by Jacques Cousteau.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-blue-hole,"The Great Blue Hole, located just 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the coast of Belize, is an underwater sinkhole that researchers believe is the largest of its kind. Circular in shape and characterized by its rich, blue color, it is over 300 meters (984 feet) across and 125 meters (410 feet) deep. It lies in the center of an atoll called Lighthouse Reef, where an island of coral encircles the shallow, light turquoise-colored waters of a lagoon. Water levels there are so shallow that parts of the ring surrounding the dark blue sinkhole are even known to crest the surface at low tide. The sinkhole originally formed as a limestone cave during the last glacial period, a time when sea levels were much lower. As the ocean began to rise, the cave system flooded and eventually collapsed, creating a “vertical cave” in the ocean. As such, the site is popular among divers, who flock to the area to see the geological formations that now lie in the ocean’s depths. It’s possible to dive all year round, however, April to June is considered to be the prime time for better visibility and spotting whale sharks in the area. One such diver was undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau, who made the site famous in 1971 by declaring it one of the top ten best diving places in the world. At the time, Cousteau, sailing on his ship Calypso, investigated the sinkhole’s depths and confirmed that it had, indeed, originated from a limestone cave formation. Huge stalactites and stalagmites were also found below the surface, some even reaching 9-12 meters (30-40 feet) in length. They say, Ned Middleton, a British diver and author, gave the feature its name, which refers to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. These geological formations can still be viewed by divers today. It is said that the deeper one goes, the water becomes more clear and the formations, more complex. The Great Blue Hole is part of the larger Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, a World Heritage Site of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  Some dive tours can be booked out of hotels on Long Caye and the Turneffe Islands, Ambergris Caye, Caye Caulker and Belize City. The Great Blue Hole diving is not allowed to everyone, the prerequisite is more than 24 complete dives. Snorkeling at the top of the Hole is allowed, and as it is bordered by a reef, there is wildlife to see by simply snorkeling.",reefs blue holes geological oddities caves natural wonders ecosystems water nature
1,The Crystal Maiden of the Actun Tunichil Muknal Cave,Belize,"Sparkling, calcite-covered skeletons of children who may have been sacrificed to appease an angry god.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-crystal-maiden-of-the-actun-tunichil-muknal-cave-belize,"Uncovered in 1989, this jungle cave in the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve is accessible via an hour’s ride from San Ignacio, Belize, and a walk for another hour across shallow rivers and through jungle. Here one arrives at the Actun Tunichil Muknal or “ATM” cave mouth. To gain access to the cave, one must swim in and then wade up the cave river for another kilometer. Walking a further kilometer and a half in the cave, past huge boulders and cavernous rooms (one known as “The Cathedral”), to the back of the cave system, you find the skeletons of the ritual sacrifices made by the Maya to their gods more than a thousand years ago. The skeletons range in age from one year old to adult. Four of those sacrificed are infants between the ages of one and three, some stuffed into crevices and small adjoining caves. There is one child of seven, a teenager of 15 (who appears to have been bound before being killed), a 20-year-old, and numerous adults between the ages of 30 and 45. Many of the younger skeletons show signs of cranial deformation or “skull shaping,” giving their heads a slightly elongated alien look. Almost all were killed by blunt trauma to the head—some had their entire skulls crushed. While the precise dating of the skeletons is difficult (due to their being essentially cemented to the cave floor by calcite) most of the pottery found at the site dates from between 700 and 900 AD, which is likely when the bodies found here were sacrificed. Farther into the cave is perhaps the most famous of these long-dead Maya: the skeleton of a 17-year-old boy best known as the “The Crystal Maiden.” Though the owner of the skeleton was initially believed to be a female (due to its small size and slight frame), closer examination of the bones has revealed features that suggest they were male. (Some tour guides allegedly refer to it as “The Crystal Prince.”) The skeleton is unique in its positioning and the fact that two vertebrae are crushed. Researchers believe this person may have died in a particularly violent manner before being thrown or tossed onto the ground, where their body has lain for at least the last 1,100 years. The skeleton has been there so long, in fact, that it has completely calcified, giving the bones a sparkling, slightly plump look that inspired the crystalline nickname. It is unknown what the circumstances of the sacrifices were, though some believe they were to appease the rain god Chac, or possibly the gods of the underworld. Another theory holds that these were believed to be witches (possibly suffering from some kind of mental or physical ailments) and that leaving them unburied in the cave would ensure that their spirits were trapped there. Other items found in the cave include ceramics, marked with “kill holes,” and cave formations carved by the Maya, such as silhouettes of faces and animals. The cave is also home to Amblypygi or “whip spiders” and other predatory spiders. Due to the inaccessibility and the calcification process of the cave, many of the relics have been preserved just as they were left and very little has been removed from the cave since it was discovered. (Some things were looted early on.) The name Actun Tunichil Muknal translates as “Cave of the Crystal Sepulchre,” and the locals know it as “Xibalba” after the Mayan underworld. The Crystal Cave was traditionally believed to be an entrance to hell, a deep fissure in the earth filled with rivers of blood and scorpions. This was the domain of the Mayan death gods, the subterranean court of the Lords of Xibalba. Often referred to as demons, these 12 deities had names like “Stabbing Demon” and “Skull Staff,” and inflicted a range of maladies on people including sickness, pain, and fear. ATM cave is one of the few protected places in Belize, with only a few guides authorized to lead tours. Be very careful, however, as none of the skeletons or pottery are roped off, and one tourist has already accidentally stepped on and broken one of the skulls.  The ideal way to experience ATM is by hiring a private guide to take you at 7am before larger groups arrive. That way the journey is completely quiet and allows for one to grasp the depth of the cave, as well as the size of the grand chamber itself.   You will also need socks (some of the cave is protected, and shoes are not allowed).  Note: a licensed guide is required and arrangements must be made in advance. No photography, cell phones, cameras, food, or backpacks are allowed inside the cave.",rites and rituals subterranean sites caves ecosystems sacred spaces
2,Shark Ray Alley,"Ambergris Caye, Belize",This portion of a lovely Belize beach is infested with (harmless) sharks and rays.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shark-ray-alley,"There is a lovely little spot in the Hol Chan Marine Reserve where the weather is warm, the waters are crystal clear, and the diving and snorkeling is unparalleled. That is, if you don’t mind getting in the water with a hoard of sharks and rays, which you should. Known fittingly as Shark Ray Alley, this popular dive spot is a hotspot for largely harmless nurse sharks and smaller rays. The spot came to be not because of any feature of the environment, but because local fishermen used to come to the spot to clean their catches, filling the waters with morsels that were perfect for the bottom feeding nurse sharks and rays. Soon the animals recognized that they could come to the spot for a reliable meal and returned in droves. Then, in the perfect circle of life, the fishermen got the local dive masters to start coming to site, letting divers get up close and personal with the animals, and actively feeding them to keep them coming back. Nowadays the sharks and rays can actually hear the boats coming and swarm the area when their gravy trains approach. Divers and snorkelers get to jump into the teeming waters to swim alongside the animals, while dive-masters keep them in the area by feeding them. The four-five foot sharks are not really interested in making a meal out of any tourists, but they are sharks nonetheless, so a diving in the area is probably best reserved for those who are not afraid of the animals. The water is only around eight feet deep, and there are a number of beautiful reefs to check out while you are beneath the waves, but again, there are a ton of sharks and rays just swimming around. A great place if that’s your thing.",underwater week beaches water animals
3,Altun-Ha,"Rock Stone Pond, Belize",An important Mayan religious and trading center dating back to 200 BC.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/altun-ha,"About 31 miles north of Belize City sits the Mayan ruins of Altun-Ha. The site was first excavated in 1963 and was once home to 10,000 people covering more than 3.1 square miles. The former Mayan city contains two main plazas and around thirteen different structures. Visitors to Altun-Ha can climb most of the structures and have the freedom to roam around most of the site. Climbing to the top of the Temple of Masonry Altars⁠—the largest temple-pyramid at the complex⁠—offers an amazing panorama of the surrounding ruins and site. Altun-Ha has not been fully excavated and grass still grows between some of the stones, making Altun-Ha feel lost in time.  This site is easily reached from Belize City and is perfect for a day trip. There are some great places to eat on location and even a few shops. This site is also handicap accessible and has nice facilities. It's open year-round from 8 a.m.– 5:00 p.m.",mayan ancient ruins
4,Lubaantun Archeological Reserve,"Dump, Belize",A devastated ruin in the south of Belize where British explorers claimed to unearth the Mitchell-Hedges Crystal Skull.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lubaantun-archeological-reserve,"The Mayan ruin of Lubaantun has had an unfortunate “recent” history. Discovered and written about in 1903, it was revisited in 1917 by a Thomas Gann who haphazardly used dynamite in his search for treasure. This counter-intuitive method of treasure hunting decimated many of the ruins and hindered possible future research. It was visited again by a team of British Archaeologists between 1921 and 1930 but little more was documented and evidence suggests they cared very little for the history of the ruins. Thomas Gann returned to the ruins In 1924, with adventurer F.A. Mitchell-Hedges and others in tow. Anna Mitchell-Hedges, daughter of F.A. Mitchell-Hedges, claimed to have stumbled upon the infamous crystal skull while tagging along with her father. While it made a lovely story, there is absolutely nothing to support the claim, and plenty to debunk it—including the unlikelihood that the younger Mitchell-Hedges ever even set foot in Belize. As far as the skull goes, many say the technology used to make it is too advanced for the Mayans. Of course, some claim aliens had a hand in it which is the basis for the 2007 Indiana Jones film. Others say the skull is a hoax, made in Germany and purchased in London in 1920 (one year before the expedition). Locals in Belize believe the skull, real or not, should be returned to its rightful place in Lubaantun. The skull is currently owned and kept by Bill Holmes, a wealthy collector. While not as thrilling as the mysterious crystal skull artifact, many pieces of pottery have been preserved by more successful expeditions, and it’s still possible to find pieces of pottery, teeth and tools around the site today.

5,St. Herman's Blue Hole National Park,"Belmopan, Belize",A natural swimming hole that was once a ceremonial center for Mayan priests.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-hermans-blue-hole-national-park,"St. Herman’s Blue Hole National Park is a great place to stop when traveling by land from northeast Belize to the south-western stretches of the country. This picturesque location contains a massive, almost perfectly circular swimming hole fed by an underground stream. The water is so fresh and clean you can drink it, as it’s essentially a massive spring. There are tons of friendly fish in the water that love to dine on fresh fruit.  The park is also home to around 200 bird species.  There are lots of mosquitos in the area, however, repellent and sunscreen are discouraged as it pollutes the water.",parks
6,Cuello Mayan Ruins,"Orange Walk, Belize",These enigmatic ruins continue to vex archaeologists.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cuello-mayan-ruins,"Excavated by archaeologist Norman Hammond and his team from 1975 to the late 1980s, Cuello has become a conundrum for the scholastic community. When Hammond first published radiocarbon dates for the Cuello site, the discovery mired the fields of Mesoamerican Archaeology and Mayan Studies in a deep controversy: it was, according to the data, the oldest Mayan site excavated to date. Many scholars were quick to dismiss the report as inaccurate, and several more were, at the very least, hesitant to accept the findings as valid. An alternative method of dating the site was also employed, which involved analyzing the ceramics found and placing the site within a distinct technological “phase” based on similar pottery found at other sites. This, however, only deepened the mystery of Cuello’s age, as the results from the relative dating of the ceramics were mixed. Debate over the approximate age of Cuello still persists, with estimates ranging from 2600 BC to 1200 BC. What is known, however, is that the residents of Cuello were sedentary maize-croppers who likely lived in thatched houses with  bases coated in plaster. Aside from maize, the prime sources of protein would have been white-tailed deer, freshwater turtles, and domesticated dogs. Burials discovered at Cuello are often mystifying and can vary wildly. One notable interment was that of an adolescent girl, who was decapitated and buried with her head laid on her chest along with two ceramic bowls. Yet another curious burial is that of a tomb that included several grave goods of note, including artifacts made of deer bone and engraved with a pattern that would later become associated with royalty, as well as a plaque fashioned out of a human skull. Given the contents of the grave, it has been determined that this individual was likely a ruler of Cuello. Other elite burials at the site are indicated by the presence of shell and trace amounts of jade. Two separate mass graves found at the site, each containing nearly-exclusively men with severe physical trauma, also indicate periods of warfare. Additional evidence of warfare includes the burned remains of wooden structures and the desecration of the façades of stone buildings. A stela dating to 100 has also been found at Cuello; unlike the more visually impressive stelae found at other Mayan sites, this example from Cuello was blank, with no carvings and no indication of paint. It remains, however, an indication of the power of the rulers at Cuello. There is also evidence that indicates a traditional Mayan sweat bath was present at the site. There has been a lull in excavations at Cuello in recent years; all that is currently unearthed at the site is its nine-stepped pyramid. But, a short walk away from the pyramid to a nearby wooded area will yield a stunning site. The untrained eye may only see hills, but beneath these mounds are what’s left of a ceremonial complex.  The ruins are located on the premises of the Cuello Rum Distillery, which is a short drive west from Orange Walk Town. While not officially open to the public, access to the ruins may be granted by the property owners and distillery operators—the Cuello family—who will usually admit people into the site during the distillery's office hours. Visitors wishing to see the ruins may want to call the distillery office beforehand, or coordinate with a local tour guide who can arrange a trip with the management at Cuello. Visitors may also want to opt for a tour of the distillery in addition to seeing the ruins.",mayan archaeology ruins
7,Caracol,"Chapayal, Belize",This massive Maya archaeological site is home to the tallest man-made structure in Belize.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/caracol-mayan-ruins,"The road begins near San Ignacio, a rugged town in western Belize not far from the Guatemalan border. About three hours down a winding, muddy jungle road and you’ll enter the site of Caracol, a vast, ancient Mayan city that thrived for 300 years and, at its peak, covered nearly 77 square miles (200 sq km)—larger than Belize City today. Even at its busiest, you won’t find crowds of tourists at Caracol. Although it is located only about 50 miles (75 km) from Tikal, the site at Caracol remains less visited, perhaps due to its relative inaccessibility and more recent archaeological interest. Caracol was rediscovered in 1937, when a native logger named Rosa Mai came across its remains while searching for mahogany in the area. The site was surveyed the following year, but more significant investigation did not begin until 1985, when the Caracol Archaeological Project was established. The site—which is only partially uncovered—includes several plazas, acropolises, and residential areas, along with many altars and stelae. More than 250 burials and 200 caches have been discovered at the site so far. The largest building, Caana (“sky palace”), remains the tallest human-made structure in Belize at 141 feet tall (43 m). Archaeological evidence suggests that Caracol was an important Maya site that was occupied continuously from 600 B.C. to 1100 A.D. The city was at its largest and densest during the Late Classic Period, around 650. At its height, the population of Caracol is thought to be around 100,000 or more, easily exceeding Tikal’s peak population. But 300-400 years later, the central metropolis was mostly abandoned. The name Caracol means “snail,” apparently in reference to the twisted road used to approach the site.  The only way to get to Caracol is the single access road. Tour buses leave from San Ignacio, or you can drive yourself. Make sure your vehicle has good ground clearance and suitable tires. Do not attempt to drive this road in the rainy season (July-December) without first inquiring locally. Drivers must stop at two checkpoints. Drivers are also required to stop at the Douglas Da Silva Forest Station at about the halfway point, where an armed escort will lead you the rest of the way. (Inquire at San Ignacio to verify that this is still the case; you may be required to meet the escort at a certain time.) Bring your own picnic lunch and water, as there are no provisions on the site or anywhere along the way. There are several scenic spots along the route, most notably the Rio On Pools and the Rio Frio Cave.",mayan ancient archaeology ruins history & culture
8,Aviarios del Caribe: Sloth Sanctuary,"Cahuita, Costa Rica",Sloth rehabilitation center in the jungle of Costa Rica.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aviarios-del-caribe-sloth-sanctuary,"Aviarios del Caribe has some of the cutest residents in all of Costa Rica. They’re so cute that regular visitors shell out $25 for a tour and a constant stream of volunteers is moving in and out of the center’s residences. We’re talking about three-toed sloths. With a mission of protecting and rehabilitating the sloths of Costa Rica, the Aviarios del Caribe sanctuary observes the animals, studies them, cares for them, and conducts scientific analysis and research on their habitats throughout the country. With education facilities and knowledgeable staff, the sanctuary works to raise awareness about the plight of these creatures. When Buttercup (seen in the pictures above) was given to the proprietors of a small hotel outside of Limon in 1992, they knew that running a bed and breakfast-style resort wasn’t enough; they wanted to do more. Buttercup was just the first of many, many orphaned sloths that needed help adjusting to life in the wild. Since 1997, the team at the sanctuary had hand-reared more than one hundred orphaned sloths of both types found in Costa Rica and have worked with zoos and other rehabilitation centers. In 2004, the sanctuary completed a Learning Center for help educate the public about how power lines and loss of habitat are endangering the sloth population. The following year, they build a clinic, kitchen, laundry, nursery, and quarantine center. The sanctuary has been growing—in size and renown—ever since. In the future, the team hopes to work on international veterinary studies, construct new enclosures for the animals, partner with rain forest and wildlife researchers around the world, and grow their sloth adoption program, through which concerned citizens can help to support individual animals from a distance. Located just 35 Kilometers south of Limon and 10 km from Cahuita National Park Cahuita.",sloths wildlife sanctuaries natural wonders nature animals
9,Río Celeste,Costa Rica,This neon blue river gets its color from a unique mix of bacteria and volcano minerals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rio-celeste,"Nestled in the Costa Rican wilderness, the Rio Celeste is a stunning tropical gem whose iconic blue hue has turned it into a popular nature spot. Located amidst the forests of the Tenorio Volcano National Park the long river twists and turns through the wilderness maintaining its bright cerulean color all the way. The river gets its coloration from a mixture of sulfur and calcium carbonate which are seeded into the water from the nearby volcano. Along the river there are multiple hot springs and an impressive waterfall, all the same, seemingly unnatural blue. Pictures of the waters are regularly accused of being photoshopped or invented, but the simple chemistry in the river’s depths is very real, as countless hikers experience each year. Rio Celeste is located within the Tenorio Volcano National Park. The closest airport is Liberia International Airport. Many of the surrounding guesthouses/hotels have walking paths that lead directly to Rio Celeste (typically 1-2 miles). Some of guesthouse/hotel trails can be closed due to inclement weather, but the park's main entrance is usually reliable. Entrance for non-residents is $12. A 4x4 is STRONGLY recommended for getting to the park entrance, and for Costa Rica in general.

Sitting in front of a large ornate church, the public park would easily be overshadowed by its grandeur were it not for the work of gardener and artist Evangelisto Blanco who took over care of the space in the 1960s. Blanco began shaping the shrubs and hedges into abstract figures and forms. The human figures are generally squat and jolly, sometimes standing on their own and other times bunched together in groups. There are also carved animals and dinosaurs. Some of the bushes simply have faces etched into their surfaces. One bush was even been shaped into the likeness of Jesus himself in deference to the looming house of the holy. Possibly the most stunning and iconic creations however are the series of green arches that are laid out in rows that create the effect of naturally grown tunnels, through which visitors can stroll. Blanco continues to curate and shape the park to this day, making sure that none of the leafy visages grow out of the bushes, and that the tunnels remain crisp and well maintained. The church’s architecture may be awe inspiring, but the Parque Francisco Alvarado manages to be simply inspiring.",botanical tunnels topiary botanical gardens gardens parks plants
11,Territorio de Zaguates (Land of Strays),"Alajuela, Costa Rica","Where dogs like the rare ""Fire-Tailed Border Cocker"" run free on the mountainside.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/territorio-de-zaguates-land-of-strays,"Over one million stray dogs roam Costa Rica. This is both unsafe for humans and the dogs, and the numbers tick higher and higher every day. The country has criminalized euthanasia, opting to simply spay and neuter dogs instead. Many street dogs are taken into shelters and adopted out, but purebred dogs are considerably more likely to be adopted than mutts. One rescue is different—up in the mountains, Territorio de Zaguates celebrates the unique mix of each dog it takes in. Veterinarians at the free-range shelter did their best to analyze the mutts’ physical traits to take a guess at the breeds they might contain. They then gave each dog their own unique pedigree, with names like the “Furry Pinscher Spaniel” and the “Freckled Terrierhuahua.” An inspired artist painted beautiful portraits of the pedigreed mutts. When Territorio de Zaguates’ head vet appeared on Costa Rican television to talk about the canine and the special breed titles bestowed upon them, he emphasized their uniqueness. “These dogs exist only in our country,” he enthused. Dog lovers who saw the program went wild. They contacted the show to say they wanted to reserve the “Bunny-Tailed Scottish Shepterrier” or the “Long Legged Irish Schnaufox” for themselves. This prompted an out of home ad campaign featuring the delicate watercolors of the breeds on bus stations and billboards, advertising that “When you adopt a mutt, you adopt a unique breed.” This in turn led to more adoptions. The made up breeds accomplished two things. First, drew attention to the arbitrary nature of pedigrees, which are themselves a human invention. Second, it made each dog appear special and unique. The shelter has grown in popularity, and now sponsors hiking events where visitors can frolic in the mountains with hundreds of pups.

12,Diquís Spheres,Costa Rica,These mysterious ancient stone spheres were created by a civilization lost to time and are now mostly lawn ornaments.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/costa-rican-stone-spheres,"Popping up in yards across Costa Rica, the huge, stone Diquís Spheres might be seen as simply a landscaping trend, but in fact the rounded stones are mysterious artifacts that were created centuries ago in great numbers, but for unknown reasons. In the 1930s, workers from the United Fruit Company, clearing land in the Diquís Valley of Costa Rica, began unearthing large numbers of almost perfectly round stone spheres. The largest of these apparently man-made balls is over two meters in diameter and weighs over 16 tons. No one is sure exactly when or how they were made, or for what reason, but, according to University of Kansas archeologist John Hoopes, “The balls were most likely made by reducing round boulders to a spherical shape through a combination of controlled fracture, pecking, and grinding.” They were likely the product of an extinct civilization of people that existed in the area between 700 CE and 1530 CE. Today, virtually all of the spheres have been taken from their original locations. Many are prized lawn ornaments across Costa Rica.

You might remember that the sole survivor of the C-123, Eugene Hasenfus, was captured by the Sandinista Army and it was his testimony that helped to shed light on what would only later be known as the Iran-Contra Affair, the bizarre arms sales that the Reagan Administration set up with Iran to win the release of some U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon and to raise money to fund the country-revolutionary Nicaraguan guerrilla fighters. The plane’s sister was the second of two purchased by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and was, after the successful Sandinista strike, abandoned at the International Airport in San Jose. Purchased in 2000 by the proprietors of the El Avion Restaurant and Bar for $3,000, the plane was disassembled and shipped in pieces to where it currently stands. Because the fuselage was too wide for the Chiquita Banana railroad bridges that are placed around Costa Rica, it had to be sent on an ocean ferry.

Since it was shut down in 1991 the former prison has only housed the remnants of inmate graffiti scrawled across cell walls and even sketched in human blood. Given that all the artists on the island were prisoners and were provided no proper artistic tools, anything they could find that would leave a mark was used to tag the walls of the prison. Words and pictures expressed their anger and depression, along with their horniness and faith in something outside of the tropical prison. Although the vast majority of drawings in San Lucas Prison depict naked women, these explicit portraits often share wall space with haloed depictions of Jesus and other symbols of religion.

17,Genius River Bridge,Costa Rica,One Costa Rican island is so beset by illegal shark poachers that the local rangers have built an entire bridge with their confiscated gear .,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/genius-river-bridge,"The waters surrounding the small Costa Rican island of Cocos are infested with sharks, bringing with them poachers looking to cleave off some fins to sell. Yet thanks to the thankless efforts of local rangers, many of the illegal shark hunters are stopped, leaving behind the nets, lines, and buoys which have been collected to create the ramshackle Genius River Bridge on the island itself. Thanks to the natural occurrence of a series of underwater hills around Cocos, the aquatic fauna is rich and diverse. Schools of fish come to feed on the nutrient-filled waters that crash around the submerged mountains, and shivers of sharks follow the smaller fish looking for a quick meal. Right behind the herds of sharks are fleets of poachers who try to pluck the toothy monsters from the water, carve off their fins and toss them back, alive and thrashing. Shark fin still fetches a high price around the world for use in such delicacies as shark fin soup, so a haul of the spongy rudders can mean a fortune. Luckily the apex predators in this modern circle of life are the island’s rangers who constantly patrol the waters to catch poachers. Unfortunately, as is often the case on land as well, the criminals vastly outnumber the cops, so only a fraction of the fin hunters are ever caught. The government regulators don’t seem to be much help either, only passing cursory regulations such as “shark fins must be attached to a shark when brought to port,” a rule that reportedly led to unscrupulous poachers arriving with horrific shark bodies covered in crudely sewn on fins. However when the patrols do run off a poacher their gear is forfeit. It’s with this gear that an artist named “Pancho” created the short Genius River Bridge which crosses over the small island waterway. Countless round floats are stacked along the bridges rigging which is also laced with rope and netting from the catches, creating not just a unique span, but in its way a living monument to the efforts of the rangers who devote their lives to keeping sharks safe.",sharks bridges islands
18,Sanatorio Durán (Durán Sanatorium),"Potrero Cerrado, Costa Rica",This abandoned hospital is one of the most haunted places in Costa Rica.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sanatorio-duran,"It’s said Carlos Durán Cartín, a Costa Rican doctor and politician, opened this tuberculosis hospital in 1918 hoping to treat his own daughter who was suffering from the disease. He chose a remote location complete with good weather, fresh air, and natural light. Despite Cartín’s efforts to treat his daughter, she died from tuberculosis. The sanatorium continued to function after her death. It was staffed mostly by nuns, the Sisters of Charity Santa Anna. It’s said their ghosts—and the ghosts of the children who died at the sanatorium—still linger on the grounds. The hospital also housed those being treated for mental health. By the 1960s, tuberculosis was no longer an epidemic or a threat. The sanatorium’s mental health patients were transferred to better facilities, and the building went on to serve as an orphanage and then a prison. The facilities closed in the 1970s after the Irazú Volcano erupted and ruined parts of the complex. Today, you can explore the old sanatorium. Signs mark bathrooms, the morgue, doctors’ quarters, the children’s wing, and more. Knowing the suffering and sickness that took place here gives it a sad and eerie feel, especially when looking out the hospital windows on a sunny day.  The sanatorium is open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. There is a small entrance fee. You can get here by bus, car, or hire a taxi/private tour.",abandoned hospitals health disease ghosts haunted abandoned
19,The Rock Garden at Piedra Colorada,"Montezuma, Costa Rica",Balanced rock sculptures pay tribute to a murdered conservationist and his pioneer wife.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-rock-garden-at-piedra-colorada,"Years ago, a man named Jake made a daily pilgrimage to the Piedra Colorada area of the Southern Nicoya Peninsula to build balanced rock statues along the shore. He would rebuild the sculptures that were knocked over by the tide and create new statues to add to the remaining collection every day. When he moved away, travelers continued the tradition to ensure the beach would be continually marked with the delicate and often perplexing balanced rock statues called cairns. The quietude of the cairns surrounds the final resting place for Nicolas Wessberg. With his wife, Karen Mogensen, Wessberg convinced the Costa Rican government to create its first protected nature reserve. They established the nearby Cabo Blanco in the early 1970s, and today, the two trails that travel through the preserve are called the Swede’s path and Dane’s trail, after their respective home countries. Many environmentalists from around the world followed their lead, buying acres of Costa Rican land to ensure that no development would mar the complex ecosystem that is Costa Rica. Today, its the home of two UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Conservation was not a popular idea just a few decades, ago, though.  In 1975, Mogensen found her husband’s bones near Corcovado, where he was focusing his last protective efforts. While never proven, the commonly held belief is that he was assassinated by those that wished to exploit that land. A plaque honoring the duo’s efforts, perseverance, and vision now stands amidst the fitting tribute of the cairns.  Today, visitors can journey past the turtle conservation along the beach to add to the sculpture garden. To get there, it's a 20-minute walk north from the town center along the Gulf of Nicoya. Walk along the sea or on the partially shaded nature trail. If you are standing in the water, facing the cairns, you'll see a stream behind them to the left. It's a great place for kids to play as it's shallow, or you can walk further along it to see a lovely small waterfall. There is nowhere around there to buy water or food, so come prepared.",

The simple sign directs you to a rudimentary path through the cloud forest that leads down, towards the stream. It will be obvious when you arrive at Ficus la Raiz, also called el Puente Raiz or the Root Bridge. The roots of a large woody ficus plant criss-cross the small valley to form a natural bridge.  From the top, you can test your balance and bravery if you want to try to cross the river using the bridge—many visitors only get to a comfortable selfie spot and then scurry back to land. Sketchy pathways descend to the creek on either side of the bridge, allowing you to see the full size of the bridge and the tentacle-like supports along the creek’s edge.  Expect a five-minute drive from Santa Elena, and plan to spend 15-20 minutes exploring the area. By car, you can follow the GPS coordinates to a parking lot that looks like a commercial extension of a residential home with construction equipment and a gravel surface. By foot, you can either enter via a footpath near the main road, or follow the driveway to the same entrance via the parking lot. It's almost always raining in this part of Costa Rica, so you may have to hold on to branches to avoid slipping on the mud.

21,Cabuya Island Cemetery,"Cabuya, Costa Rica",There is a small island in the Gulf of Nicoya where the only human inhabitants are dead.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cemetery-cabuya-island,"The only way to reach the cemetery of Cabuya Island, also known as “Cemetery Island,” is to walk across the rocks of the sea floor at low tide. Twice each day, the ocean will part to allow visitors to take the 15-minute excursion from the mainland beach of Cabuya to the island. Where the rocky seafloor trail meets the island, there is a signposted entryway on the right. Those that venture through it will be met by a wooded pathway that leads to the tombs and gravestones of those buried there. It is truly like an opening sequence from a horror movie. As you proceed on the narrow path, you’ll likely be beckoned by a couple of stray dogs who call the island home, or you may be encircled overhead by loitering buzzards. The locals believe the island is haunted, as many of them swear they have heard voices coming from it in the night. Most of Cemetery Island’s dead are entombed, but there are two noteworthy gravesites. The first is that of a man named Frank Jaeger. His untraditional tombstone depicts a sculpture of a fist, while its other side has a plane propeller stuck to it. There is also a tombstone that is little more than a mysterious sculpture of two inscrutable heads looking in opposite directions. Little is known about either of these grave markers beyond local lore. Visitors will notice, however, that the burials are well kept and attended. Many display the artifacts and care of recent visitors; fresh flowers, stones, and shell arrangements dress many of the tombs. While the indigenous peoples of Cabuya have been using the island as a burial site since the 1700s, it’s only in the past 100 years that foreigners have also been buried there. The legend says that 100 years ago, local fishermen found a drowned body in the sea near Cabuya Island. Having no idea who the person was, they decided to bury him on the island where they found him. This began a tradition of burying the dead there, which continues today.  Anyone venturing out to the island should be aware of the tidal charts. There is no way to return to the mainland once the pathway is covered by the sea until the next low tide. There are no amenities on the island.",tidal tombs graves gravestones islands cemeteries
22,Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes,"Grecia, Costa Rica","This Costa Rican chapel is the most metal church in the world, literally.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iglesia-de-la-nuestra-senora-de-las-mercedes,"Most any resident of Grecia would point to the church as its most notable structure, but the Iglesia de la Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes church in Grecia is extra-special in that it is made entirely from sheet metal. The bright red house of worship was built in the late 19th century out of plates of imported Belgian steel. The separate plates have been plainly riveted together and the whole building painted red.  Given the odd make-up of the building, a number of legends regarding the reasons behind the church’s construction have appeared over the years. One zany theory is that the church, having been imported from Europe, was meant for Greece, but got sent to the slightly similar sounding town of Grecia. Another story says that it was meant for Chile but, due to bureaucratic quicksand, the building simply settled in Grecia. However, the truth behind the building would seem to be the one answer no one wants to believe: that the church was simply purchased by the local government and a group of investors. More specifically, the decision to purchase the church in all pre-fab metal seems to have been the work of a wealthy coffee exporter, although his reasons are unclear. Most churches are a magnet for believers but the Iglesia de la Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes may want to avoid magnets altogether.",churches sacred spaces architectural oddities architecture

Walker, an American, was in Nicaragua looking to conquer the Central American provinces and turn them into English-speaking territories where slavery would be practiced. For a time he took advantage of civil and political unrest and was successful, capturing the capital and declaring himself the President of Nicaragua. In 1856, Walker turned his sights on neighboring Costa Rica, sending a contingent of several hundred to invade and establish a foothold. Costa Rica’s president Juan Rafael Mora Porras called on civilians to assist in repelling the filibuster army and hundreds took up the cause. The march to Guanacaste took eight days, during which time the over-confident invaders had mostly relaxed and waited for more reinforcements from Nicaragua. On March 20th, the army arrived at the hacienda, surrounded the filibusters, and forced them to surrender in a stunning victory that took only 14 minutes. Although most of the filibusters managed to escape and flee back to Nicaragua, the battle spelled the beginning of the end for William Walker, whose fortunes soon began to turn. Shortly thereafter Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador joined Costa Rica in the military campaign against Walker. He surrendered to the Central American coalition on May 1st, 1857 but was allowed to return to the United States, but not for long. Only a few years later he attempted to mount an invasion of Honduras but was quickly captured, tried, and executed.",war history monuments military history & culture
25,El Arbol Hueco,"Monteverde, Costa Rica",A secret climbing tree hides along the side of a Costa Rican road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-arbol-hueco,"With no signs or markings on the road to indicate the trailhead, most people discover el arbol hueco through word of mouth. It’s a few meters off the road and easy to find when you know what you’re looking for, mostly because it stands out from the other vegetation in the forest. This magical “hollow tree” (in reality a series of ficus trees that have zigzagged together over the years) is located right off a small road on the outskirts of Santa Elena, in Monteverde, Costa Rica. With a hollow interior and easy to grip “branches,” you can easily climb to the top and imagine yourself as a character from Fern Gully or Avatar. Get close to the tree, and you’ll see its hollow interior is perfect for climbing and can fit two to three people at once. The top does get narrow and you don’t want to be maneuvering around a traffic jam so high up, so it’s best to take turns and allow one person to climb at a time. While it may feel a bit scary to be up so high, the climb itself is almost like going up a ladder, and being encircled by the tree does give a sense of protection and comfort. But don’t be fooled into a false sense of security—there are no harnesses or safety equipment available, so be careful!  You can walk to the main access road from your hotel, but it'll be a bit of a hike up the hill to reach the entrance to the trail. Otherwise you can take a taxi. The entrance is unmarked, but there's a small inlet where you can park your car close to the fork in the road and you'll recognize the start of the trail. About 82 feet (25 meters) from the road you'll come across the tree. As of January 2019, there was nobody charging an entrance fee so this activity is gratis!",flora roadside attractions trees plants
26,Joya de Ceren,El Salvador,A Mayan village preserved for centuries in volcanic ash.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/joya-de-ceren,"Joya de Cerén was a pre-Hispanic farming community that, like Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy, was buried under an eruption of the Laguna Caldera volcano c. AD 600. Because of the exceptional condition of the remains, they provide an insight into the daily lives of the Central American populations who worked the land at that time. Joya de Cerén is remarkable by virtue of the completeness of the evidence that it provides of everyday life in a Mesoamerican farming community of the 6th century AD, which is without parallel in this cultural region. It was a pre-Hispanic farming community that, like Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy, was buried under a volcanic eruption about AD 590. Although a warning earthquake apparently gave residents time to flee, the ash preserved their personal belongings, from garden tools and bean-filled pots to sleeping mats and religious items, essentially freezing the agricultural village in time. Because of the exceptional condition of the remains, they provide an insight into the daily lives of the Central American peoples who worked the land at that time. Around AD 200, the central and western parts of the territory of the modern Republic of El Salvador were buried beneath thick layers of volcanic ash from the Ilopango volcano. The area was abandoned and the late pre-Classical Maya cultural evolution was interrupted for several centuries until the ash layer had weathered into fertile soil. Resettlement did not begin until around 400, and the Joya de Cerén settlement was founded before the end of the 6th century. As excavations are still in progress, it is not yet clear whether it was a small village or a larger community. Evidence from the structures excavated so far suggests that the inhabitants were farmers. Not long afterwards, around 600, Joya de Cerén was destroyed by the eruption of the Loma caldera, less than 1 km from the settlement. Although the eruption only affected some 5 km2 , it completely buried Joya de Cerén under 5-7 m of volcanic ash. The site was discovered during the construction of government grain-storage silos in 1976, when a clay-built structure was exposed by a bulldozer. Excavation were carried out under the direction of Dr Payson D. Sheets (University of Colorado) in 1978 and 1980, but were interrupted by civil war. They were resumed in 1988 and have been continuing since that time. Twelve structures were excavated, including living quarters, storehouses, workshops, kitchens, a communal sauna and a religious structure. Cerén is thought to have been home to about 200 people, although no human remains have been found. The buildings are grouped into compounds that include structures for sleeping, storage, cooking and handicrafts. The specialized structures include a sweat house, a large communal building, and two which may have been used by specialists such as a shaman or a healer. The volcanic eruption was so sudden that artefacts representative of every aspect of daily life were found still in place around the buildings, while perishable materials, including plants, survive either as carbonized material or as casts in the ash deposit. The objects recovered by excavation from the buildings constitute a virtual inventory of their contents at the moment of eruption. Several cultivated fields and other vegetation have also been uncovered. These include fields containing young and mature maize plants, a kitchen garden with a variety of herbs and a henequen (agave) garden. Various fruit trees, including guayaba and cacao, have also been found. Source: UNESCO/CLT/WHC",fiery wonders lost tribes ghost towns ruins

The Fireball Festival commemorates a landmark volcanic eruption in 1658, which, according to legend, was actually a battle between local patron saint San Jeronimo and the Devil. As a tribute to this divine clash between good and evil, Nejapa becomes an unregulated battleground for two warring groups, who marinate balls of cloth in kerosene, light them on fire, and hurl them at one another at close range while flanking crowds cheer them on. The Fireball Festival is one of the most prominent events on Nejapa’s calendar, with emergency medical respondents and a fleet of cops on hand for when chaos inevitably ensues. With no set rules or laws to abide by, in conjunction with its religious significance in a devout region, the Fireball Festival is a point of both celebration and criticism, but a sure-fire spectacle nonetheless.

This landmark 12-year period was characterized by civilian massacres and a draft that recruited child soldiers, with the final death toll estimated at 75,000, not accounting for the 8,000-plus citizens who vanished without a trace. Museo de la Revolución Salvadoreña, also known as the Museum of the Revolution, commemorates the events, heroes, and victims of the Civil War from Perquín, a Salvadoran municipality in the country’s northeastern hills. The one-story museum houses a collection of wartime artifacts and memorabilia, from the gunned-down helicopter that killed Domingo Monterossa—the colonel responsible for the infamous El Mozote Massacre of 1981, in which over 800 civilians were murdered—to the studio of Radio Venceremos, the leftist radio network that broadcast its mission throughout El Salvador’s rural regions. Outside, visitors can see the gigantic crater left by a 500-pound bomb funded by the United States military, and crawl through hillside tunnels dug by guerrilla rebels. Former guerrillas offer guided tours of the museum, lending an imperative first-person context to the artifacts on view. Their profession as tour guides is an attempt to activate so-called alternative tourism, which endeavors to draw North American and European visitors away from the capital and to important historic sites such as this across the country.  Tour guides, all of whom were guerrillas in the Civil War, are on-site to answer questions and provide more information about exhibited artifacts, but most don’t speak English.

Virtually inaccessible to all but the heartiest four-wheel drive vehicles, the Semuc Champey natural monument boasts six stunning tiered turquoise pools, an extensive cave network complete with underground waterfalls, and breathtaking views. The shockingly blue pools rest on top of a natural limestone bridge covering a portion of the Cahabón River. The site is located far from any large settlement down rough, rock-strewn roads. However the difficulty of getting to this unique natural landscape is rewarded many times over by the sights and experiences awaiting guests upon arrival. Visitors who opt to take the guided tour, which is recommended, will warm up with a rope swing leap into the river — optional, of course — before grabbing a candle and wading through a series of watery caves. The above-ground portion of the tour meanders through the forest before dropping guests at their final activity: a relaxing swim in the limestone pools. While it is possible to rent a car and drive on your own, the easiest and safest way to get to Semuc Champey is by booking a minibus through a travel agency in one of Guatemala's larger cities. Minibuses will drop you off at Lanquin, the town closest to Semuc Champey and from there you can either walk for about 2.5 hours or take a 4x4 pickup truck ""taxi"" to the entrance of the falls.

On clear days, from the mountain top, tourists can even spot Guatemala City and the neighboring volcanoes of Agua, Fuego, and Acatenango. Since 1965, when it became active once again, the Pacaya, whose slow-flowing lava rivers are, by volcano standards, less dangerous, has become a magnet for tourists. And, in 2019, the Pacaya became the first pizza place in the country, and one of the first on earth, to use lava caves as ovens. Pizza Pacaya’s founder, chef and accountant Mario David García Mansilla, became fascinated with the Pacaya in 2010, when the volcano exploded spectacularly, spewing bright-red flaming rocks over the roofs of San Vicente Pacaya and nearby villages. Ashes reached Guatemala’s International Airport, La Aurora, and flights were suspended for a day. Instead of running away, García Mansilla decided to stay close to the mighty mountain. His curiosity took him near the volcano’s crater, where he saw guides inviting tourists to roast marshmallows over the hardened-but-still-hot lava. He decided that he wanted to roast more than candy, and settled on baking pizzas. For years, he baked pies for him and his friends on the cave-like structures. In 2019, after perfecting his technique, his hobby became a business. García Mansilla regularly hikes to the volcano’s top carrying about 60 pounds of ingredients and equipment on his back to meet tourists who have made a reservation. García Mansilla offers them various toppings, including meats (salami, pepperoni, chorizo, prosciutto) and vegetables (onions, olives, and peppers), and customers can request other extras in advance. He assembles the pizza using previously kneaded dough and bakes it for about 14 minutes. When he cooks on top of still-hot lava, the process only takes a couple of minutes, as the magma can reach up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 °C).  The easiest way to get to the Pacaya Volcano is from Antigua, about two hours away by bus. Make sure to wear comfortable clothes and appropriate hiking shoes for the 90-minute walk, and bring sunscreen, water, and snacks. García Mansilla strongly recommends setting up a previously agreed visit via his Facebook page or WhatsApp number, +502 5743 0259. Since the Pacaya Volcano is a national park, only official guides are authorized to hike tourists up. So, once you contact him, García Mansilla will set you up with one of those guides, who will meet you at an agreed-upon spot and then accompany you up. If you’re traveling with children, elderly people, or people with physical disabilities, García Mansilla and the guides can organize horses or vehicles for the trip to the top of the volcano.",pizza hiking volcanoes restaurants Unique Restaurants & Bars food

From the air, it looks like some sort of strange, lonely volcano randomly plopped within the vegetation. But the structure is actually one of the world’s largest pyramids, part of the “lost city of the Maya.” El Mirador, the lost city, thrived from the sixth through third centuries BC. In the following centuries, construction within the city slowed, and its population began to dwindle. It was finally abandoned in the waning days of the ninth century. In the years since its people left, the jungle swallowed the city’s many stone structures. The site laid dormant for hundreds of years until archaeologists began excavating it in the mid-19th century. Thousands of structures fill the Prehispanic city, but perhaps none are as impressive as the La Danta temple. La Danta stands a staggering 236 feet tall. It has a total volume of nearly 99 million cubic feet, making it one of the world’s largest pyramids, as well as one of the world’s most enormous ancient structures. It’s been calculated that 15 million man-days of labor were needed to construct the gigantic building. A staircase leads up the temple’s eastern face, rewarding those who climb it with views of a sea of trees that stretches as far as the eye can see.

36,Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo),Guatemala,A ruined Maya city that suffered a years-long case of mistaken identity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mixco-viejo-jilotepeque-viejo,"Unlike the more famous Maya ruins scattered throughout Central America, Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) attracts only the odd trickle of tourists. The remarkably well-preserved city is so obscure even archaeologists mislabeled it. For many years, archaeologists and historians believed this ruined city was the capital of the Poqomam Maya, thanks to the errors of early colonial explorers. It wasn’t until linguist Robert M. Carmack noticed Jilotepeque Viejo lay well outside the linguistic area normally associated with the Poqomam kingdom that people realized the site was actually Jilotepeque Viejo, capital of the Chajoma Kaqchikel kingdom. However, its original name stuck. Now, the site is commonly referred to as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) to set it apart from the true Poqomam capital. The Chajoma built the city to ward off their aggressive neighbors. Though their city was well-protected with ravines and the confluence of two rivers, the fortress fell to the Kaqchikel anyway and became part of their kingdom until Jilotepeque Viejo was abandoned during the 16th-century Spanish conquest. Luckily, the magnificent temples and grounds are preserved and accessible today. The temples and other buildings at Jilotepeque Viejo are somewhat unique because the stone blocks are thin compared to the bulkier blocks found at other famous Maya sites like Tikal. You can climb to the top of its Twin Towers, though the steep, narrow stairs were originally meant to be used only by royalty. You can also walk the length of the Mesoamerican ballgame court, which is shaped sort of like the letter “I.” The game was played with a heavy rubber ball that was passed between team members who struck the ball with their hips. Players in some competitions had ample incentive to win—the losers could be sacrificed. Visitors might even find evangelical Christians sermonizing at the foot of a temple or Maya engaged in rituals of their own. Often, despite its past as a fortress, the ruined city is peaceful and serene.  Ask your hotel concierge or front desk staff to help you locate a driver who knows the area. Distance to Mixco Viejo is not far, but the road is winding and sometimes takes the visitor through villages with many streets. Expect the drive to take about two hours or more from Guatemala City, and be sure to bring drinking water.",mistakes fortresses cities temples archaeology ruins

The 13-year project resulted in the completion of a topographical map of an area of 16 square kilometers of the site of Tikal. When occupied, the camp included a settlement for archaeologists and single workers, and a separate settlement for married workers that featured a sawmill, a school, and a dispensary. The wooden barracks housing the researchers have long been dismantled. The cars and camp equipment - material traces of the UPenn project - rust quietly in the lush vegetation.

The vibrantly colored designs on the kites, made of cloth and paper with bamboo frames, depict religious or folkloric themes and they are flown in the nearby Sacatepéquez cemetery to honor the dead. The locals in this small municipality dress up in colorful clothing and head to the cemetery to spend the day cleaning up the graves and decorating them with flowers while they have picnics right next to their departed family members. Traditionally, the building of the kites takes 40 days, the first day marked by the village’s unmarried men heading out to the coast at 4:00 am to laboriously collect bamboo for the kite frames. Every part of the kite is made using nature’s bounty; the glue is a mixture of yucca flower, lemon peel, and water, ropes are made of the maguey plant (the plant that also brings us tequila), and the tails are made from woven cloth. The practice of flying colorful kites during the Day of the Dead celebrations has been around for 3,000 years and is recognized by various religious sects, and locals believe it is a tool for communicating with the beyond.",wondrous performances cultures and civilizations festivals

It is the result of a massive volcanic explosion 84000 years ago, known as the Los Chocoyos eruption. It is surrounded by three volcanoes, Volcan Atitlán, Volcán San Pedro and Volcán Tolimán. In addition, a forth volcano, Fuego can often be seen smoking on the horizon. The towns surrounding the lake are home to vibrant Mayan communities as well as a thriving tourist industry centred in Panajachel. Aldous Huxley famously wrote of it: “Lake Como, it seems to me, touches on the limit of permissibly picturesque, but Atitlán is Como with additional embellishments of several immense volcanoes.

Situated in the town of San Andrés Xecul, Totonicapán, department of Guatemala., the church is a lasting legacy of colonialism in Guatemala, and an eye-popping example of syncretism in Latin American Christianity. Starkly differing from the drab and cold cathedrals of mainland Europe, La Iglesia de San Andres is a wildly colored and visually-stunning proclamation of faith. With its bright yellow facade, it is impossible to miss from the city of Quetzaltenango. However, along with its obvious beauty, the church carries an obvious legacy of colonial influence in Guatemala. Despite the connection of the church with its forceful past, the designs on the facade are distinctly Latin American and more specifically Mayan. Aside from the typical bright colors and designs, many of the figures depicted on the church are also holding ferns, leaves and other plants. This strong connection to nature harkens back to the pre-Columbian era and humans interaction with nature. Imagery of note on the west facade includes angels, corn, quetzals, monkeys, and jaguars. In many ways, the Mayan influenced patterns sharply differentiate the church from classic Christian monuments. However, the bright colors also serve to put the lasting impact of European influence front and center in Guatemala, forcing an unavoidable history lesson, even for those that don’t want to remember the European legacy on Latin America.  From Quetzaltenago or Totonicapán you can take a shuttle or public transportation bus to the town of San Andrés Xecul.",sacred spaces
41,Mayan Stelae at Quirigua,Guatemala,"Mesoamerican monoliths and zoomorphic stones covered in royal visages, ancient mythology, and grand celestial events.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mayan-stelae-at-quirigua,"In the 8th century, at the height of ancient Mesoamerican culture, the city of Quirigua was one of its most important settlements, a World Heritage site that UNESCO calls “one of the major testimonies to the Mayan civilization.” Situated at the crossroads of important trade routes in southeastern Guatemala, Quirigua teemed with cultural, civil, economic and royal life. At the site today are the remains of this once-grand city, including the Great Plaza (the largest known public gathering space of this Mayan region), and 17 stelae and zoomorphic monuments carved from sandstone. Stelae are tall monoliths engraved in varying degrees of detail, to act as everything from calendars, to storytellers, to godly and royal icons. Known to have been created in several ancient cultures, standing stones of the Mayan—such as these at Quirigua—were often erected as testimonials to rulers and their glorious deeds, or to mark astronomical and seasonal events. At over 30 feet, one is the largest stelae has hieroglyphic texts that describe important social and celestial milestones, as well as passages of Mayan mythology. Stela C, erected in the year 775, includes the “Long Count” date (the Mesoamercian measure of time) of 13.0.0.0.0, which corresponds to a date in August of 3114 BC (some say the 11th, others the 13th). For the Mayan, this marked the end of the Third World and beginning of the Fourth, when it was thought humans first roamed the Earth. It’s this Long Count system that foretold the “End of the World” as December 21, 2012 for some modern doomsdayers. Half a decade later and not only is the world still here, but so are the Quirigua stelae. With care, they will last well into the Fifth World. The site is about a four-hour drive northeast of Guatemala City, or if you are planning to visit Tikal it's a little longer but worth a detour.

They’re spectacularly beautiful, made all the more special by the backdrop of volcano-surrounded Lake Atitlan, a jewel of Guatemala, often (rightly) referred to as the most beautiful lake in the world. The botanical gardens are the gem of Hotel Atitlan, where they wind seemingly endlessly through the hotel grounds. There’s a dazzling variety of plants and flowers—more than 500 different species from 250 plant families—meticulously cultivated over many years with loving attention down to every last detail. Wandering through, there’s a new picture-perfect landscape at each turn filled with surprises, if you take a close enough look. One of these is the antique rose garden, blooming with heirloom varieties dating back to the 18th century. The antique rose garden is one of three rose gardens on the property, which has a cumulative total of over 200 varieties of roses. The antique roses—also called heritage, historic, heirloom, and old roses—are defined as roses from classes that existed before the introduction of the La France in 1867, which is considered the first modern rose. The original old roses came from Europe in the late 1700s and were hybridized with China and Tea Roses from Asia around 1800. There are dozens of varieties in the hotel’s collection, with signs indicating their names and the year of origin. Old roses are known for their intense fragrance and ruggedness; they’re extremely low-maintenance to grow and not only survive but thrive without human care. Compared to modern roses, they tend to have a muted, softer hues and have been overshadowed in the last several decades by new varieties bred for big blooms with more pop (though antique roses are starting to make a comeback). The hotel botanical gardens were started in the late ’70s, the passion project of Susan Rivera, wife of Arturo Rivera, who had just inherited the property from his parents and started building Hotel Atitlan.

44,Spider Monkeys of Tikal,"Tikal, Guatemala",Monkeys inhabit the lush forest surrounding ancient Mayan ruins once considered sacred.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spider-monkeys-of-tikal,"Visiting the sprawling ruins of the Mayan city of Tikal makes for an eerie and timely lesson on the fragility of human societies. Here the most powerful civilization of Mesoamerica ruled supreme before its mysterious collapse and the encroachment of the forest. But a denizen of the jungle that has witnessed the rise and fall of the ancient Maya still lingers on. These are a primate known as Geoffrey’s spider monkey, a species that is native to the rainforests of Mexico, Central America, and parts of northern Colombia. One of the largest New World primates, they live in troops of between 20 to 40 individuals and feed upon the ripe fruit and leaves provided by the many tree species of the forests. In turn, the seeds are dispersed over vast distances by the monkeys, who are one of the many animals that ensure the forest’s growth. This remarkable animal may be observed easily by visitors at Tikal, as it brachiates through the liana laden boughs of the great ceiba trees with a grace that would make even the most talented circus acrobat jealous. The monkeys possess a prehensile tail which has evolved to serve as a dexterous fifth limb, and which is used with remarkable agility in locomotion across the canopies. In the Mayan civilization, the monkey was considered a divine animal imbued with profound cultural significance. Although the Mayans held no concept of the scientific theory of evolution as it is currently understood, they conceived of monkeys as being the venerable ancestors of humankind. The sacred book of creation myths, the Popol Vuh, related that primates were a lifeform that had arisen during one of the many earlier experimental periods of creation by the gods. According to the myth, the gods were ultimately disappointed with the result, which they found to be too frivolous and rebellious and thus strove to perfect and shape the form of some of the monkeys. In the process of the modification and reshaping, the gods managed to create the human race, and feeling content with their invention gave this “primate 2.0” permission to rule the Earth. As the forerunner of the human race, the monkey, therefore, was perceived to occupy a semi-sacred role within the complex cosmovision of the Mayans. The two types of monkey that inhabit the forests of northern Central America, the howler monkey and the spider monkey, were seen to represent different aspects of the divine. The howler monkey (known as “Batz” in the Mayan language), due to its more somber and reserved appearance, was connected with seriousness, duty, and work, and therefore associated with scribes. The more active, intelligent, and mischevious spider monkey (or “Ma’ax” as it is known in Mayan) meanwhile was associated in a “Joie de vivre” manner with the affirmation of life, joy, celebrations, creativity, sexuality, and pranks. Today the spider monkey is an endangered species across much of its range. It has vanished from many of the regions in Central America where it was once abundant as the rainforests are felled for timber and are replaced by farmland. Fortunately, however, in Guatemala’s Tikal National Park, at least for the time being, this sacred simian continues to cling to survival, as it has done for thousands of years.  The spider monkeys (and their howler monkey relatives) can be seen relatively easily on most of the trails around the Tikal Archeological Site and National park. To avoid being defecated or urinated on by monkeys (it happens surprisingly frequently), try to avoid standing directly underneath the trees they are sitting in and instead observe them from a distance with binoculars. Please don't feed the monkeys with human food as these can make them sick and encourage an unhealthy habituation to human beings.",rainforest gods monkeys mayan endangered animals cultures and civilizations forests ancient ecosystems ruins animals
45,Mapa en Relieve,"Guatemala City, Guatemala","An impressive century-old, to-scale topographical map of Guatemala.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/map-en-relieve-relief-map,"For a relatively small country (at about 42,000 square miles it’s roughly the size of Tennessee), Guatemala has an exceptionally diverse climate packed within its borders. The landscape ranges from lush tropical jungles to Pacific blank sand beaches to snow-peaked, high-elevation volcanoes. The best way to get a snapshot of this unique geography is right in the center of the capital city, at this century-old, to-scale topographical map of the country. The Mapa en Relieve (Relief Map) in Guatemala City is a large, impressively accurate 3D replica of the country’s remarkable terrain. It depicts in intricate detail the major cities, towns, volcanoes, rivers, lakes, plateaus, and valleys blanketing the landscape, at a scale of 1:10,000 kilometers. This is all the more impressive considering the map was made more than 100 years ago, without the help of satellites and modern technology. The map was unveiled in 1905. Its creators spent some 15 years traveling the country by donkey and horseback surveying the highs and lows of the land. Engineer Francisco Vela directed the construction of the map, and Costa Rican engineer Claudio Urrutia was the main explorer. He even invented a tool to help accurately measure the topography, a theodolite called the “Mira Urrutia”, or Urrutia Viewer. (He is only now getting recognition for his accomplishments, thanks to the help of his descendants.) Once the wealth of data was collected, it took Vela’s team 18 months to build the map. All these years (and several major hurricanes) later, the map still stands intact, though a little worse for the wear. It’s a real engineering wonder and a gem of Guatemala City. But while it’s regularly visited by schoolchildren in the area, the relief map is frequently overlooked by tourists. That’s a shame, because for visitors planning to travel around the country, taking in a birds-eye view of the landscape from one of the site’s observation towers is the perfect starting point to get your bearings. Looking down at the counters of the map, you’re struck by how extremely mountainous the terrain is, except at the coasts (the country is bordered by the Pacific and Caribbean) and the vast stretch of lowlands to the north. The landscape is covered in hills, valleys, rivers, and lush forests. (The name Guatemala is derived from a Mayan word for a “place of many trees.”) There are 37 volcanoes packed into the highlands, three of which are active. At an elevation of nearly 14,000 feet, Tajumulco Volcano is the highest point in Central America. The 1,800-square-foot map (which, due to the era it was made includes Belize, now a free sovereign independent country) is one of the only cement 3D scale maps in the world.

46,Casa Popenoe,"Antigua, Guatemala",This restored colonial house was once home to the botanist responsible for bringing avocados to the U.S.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-popenoe,"Casa Popenoe was built in the 18th century on top of preexisting colonial structures—one building from the 1600s, another from the 1500s. Wilson and Dorothy Popenoe bought the property in 1930 and got to work restoring it. They renovated the house and filled it with period furniture. After Dorothy died, Wilson and his second wife, Helen, continued collecting artifacts and art to reflect the place’s colonial history. But the Popenoes did more than just preserve this small patch of history—they also made massive contributions to the U.S. avocado industry. Wilson Popenoe is responsible for bringing the first avocados into California. He hopped aboard his trusty steeds and embarked on numerous exploration missions throughout Central America in search of new fruit specimens to ship stateside. He eventually became the chief agronomist for the United Fruit Company. The Popenoe family donated the house to the Universidad Francisco in Marroquín in 2007. Visitors can arrange group tours to view the colonial artifacts and learn more about Wilson Popenoe’s achievements as a botanist.  Casa Popenoe asks visitors to contact a day in advance so that they can organize a group tour.

47,Howler Monkeys of Tikal,"Tikal, Guatemala",These roaring primates were considered a divine creature in the cosmology of the Maya.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tikal-howler-monkeys,"As you wander the ruins of the ancient citadel of Tikal you are likely to hear, at some point, a thundering guttural roar that reverberates across the forest like the lament of one of the tormented and bellicose demons of Maya mythology. Listening to this nightmarish noise you could almost be forgiven for thinking that a death metal concert is in progress somewhere in the forest. Follow the source of this sinister sound, if you dare, and you’ll invariably find yourself staring up at a troop of dark-furred monkeys perched nonchalantly among the branches of a ceiba tree. These are howler monkeys, and the sound they produce that is so emblematic of the Central American rainforest unsurprisingly gives the species its common name of “howler” in the English (“aullador” in Spanish). The rowdy and resonant roaring of this animal can be deafening when heard at close quarters and is so loud it can literally make your ears ring or induce headaches. This ritualized behavior is performed mainly by the group’s alpha male at dawn, dusk, and often at odd moments throughout the day. The vocalizations serve as a nonviolent means of demarcating territorial boundaries and attracting mates. When other members of the troop join in the cacophony of roaring, it also helps to cement social bonds and give the group a sense of solidarity and unity, making it somewhat similar to the howling of wolves or, in human terms, a church choir. The howler monkey is almost entirely a folivore, meaning that for the most part it eats leaves and the buds of certain trees, rather than fruit as the spider monkey does. This diet is far lower in energy and therefore the howlers are distinctly slower, more lethargic, and generally far less active primates. They require lots of resting periods, making them far easier to spot than the sympatric spider monkey. Much of the howler monkey’s day is spent chilling out in the boughs of trees in between their folivorous feasts, and although this languorous behavior makes the howler monkey seem to be quite the slacker, it is in fact an evolutionary adaption and physiological necessity. In the Maya civilization, the monkey was considered a divine animal imbued with profound cultural significance. Although the Mayans held no concept of the scientific theory of evolution as it is currently understood, they conceived of monkeys as being the venerable ancestors of humankind. According to the sacred book of creation myths, the Popol Vuh, primates were a life form that had arisen during one of the many earlier experimental periods of creation by the gods.

As the forerunner of the human race, the monkey, therefore, was perceived to occupy a semi-sacred role within the complex cosmovision of the Mayans. Due to its sullen and dour appearance, the howler monkey (known as “Batz” in the Mayan language), was connected with seriousness, duty, and work, and therefore associated with scribes. In certain kingdoms and notably in the city of Copan (in present-day Honduras), the figure of the howler monkey scribe was wholly embraced by the ruling elite (in a manner similar to the Hamydryas baboon in ancient Egypt), and huge stone sculptures and stelae depicting these important animals presided over temples.  The howler monkeys can be seen very easily at the ruins of Tikal. A troop lives in the ceiba trees around the Temple IV where they can be seen (and heard) most days lounging in the branches. To avoid being defecated or urinated on by monkeys (it happens surprisingly frequently), try to avoid standing directly underneath the trees the animals are sitting in and instead observe them from a distance with binoculars.

49,California Avocado Plaque,"Antigua, Guatemala","Believe it or not, the now-ubiquitous California avocado originated in Guatemala.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/california-avocado-plaque,"In 1946, the California Avocado Society presented a plaque to the city of Antigua Guatemala. The gift was a gesture of gratitude for the ancient city’s role in the creation of the avocado industry that flourishes in California today, which would likely not exist without the seedlings that made their way north from Guatemala. The creamy fruit was first introduced in the United States from Mexico in the 1870s, and become such a commercial success there was a rush to find more varieties that could be cultivated. The newly formed California Avocado Association sent plant explorer Wilson Popenoe to Guatemala to study and bring back seeds and samples. Popenoe spent a year in the Central American country and discovered, as he wrote in the association’s annual report, that Antigua was “the most important (avocado growing) region in all Guatemala, if not one of the most important in the world.” He carried a few of these varieties back home and some, like the Lyon and Nimlioh avocado, are still cultivated. Popenoe continued his avocado mission and later went on to become the chief agronomist of the United Fruit Company. According to most reports, the Hass avocado—the most popular commercial variety in the world today—also stems from Guatemalan seedlings, possibly the Lyon variety. The seeds found their way into the hands of a green-thumbed mailman named Rudolph Hass living in La Habra Heights, California. Quite by accident, Hass discovered they grew into a tree that bore a rough, dark-skinned variety of the fruit. These little avos were uglier, sure, but also creamier and tastier than the common Fuerte variety of the time, which had been introduced by Popenoe. Hass became the first American to patent a tree, and the avocados he named after himself spread across the world. By 1990, the Hass avocados accounted for more than 80 percent of California’s avocado production. This culinary contribution is marked by a humble plaque, which can be found today on the main square of Antigua. It reads, in both Spanish and English, “In recognition and appreciation of the great contributions of Antigua and of all of Guatemala, to the development of the avocado industry of California.” A line at the end adds, oh so sweetly, “A healthy child salutes a generous parent.”  From the cathedral on the main square, walk towards the fountain of the mermaids, after the first garden area, walk towards your left and the plaque should be in the middle the garden area facing the fountain.",fruit plaques trees plants food
50,Chapel of El Rey San Pascual,"Olintepeque, Guatemala","Hidden in the highlands of Guatemala, a small shrine venerates a forbidden folk saint.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapel-of-rey-san-pascual,"In the village of Olintepeque outside Quetzaltenango, just behind the old colonial church, you’ll find the Chapel of El Rey San Pascual, also known as San Pascualito, a folk saint that has been revered in secret since colonial times. Known as the “king of the graveyard” or “king of the underworld,” he takes the image of a skeleton wearing a cape or crown, and is related to the Maya’s ancestral god of death. The origins of El Rey San Pascual date back to 1650, a time when the beliefs of the indigenous people were mixing with Catholicism under Spanish colonial rule. The name itself from a Spanish Catholic friar named Paschal Baylon. It’s said that a skeleton dressed in robes appeared to an indigenous Kaqchikel man in a vision, calling himself “Saint Paschal Baylon” and promised that the disease epidemic that was sweeping the region would end if the people worshipped him. They have ever since, despite the official disapproval of the Catholic church. The graveyard king shares similarities with the ancient Mayan god of death and is associated with curing disease. San Pascualito is venerated in Guatemala and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but since the folk saint is not recognized by the Catholic church, the villagers in Olintepeque decided to construct an exclusive chapel dedicated to him. There, the death god is represented by the image of a skeleton sitting on a chair carved in wood. People travel to the village to visit the little chapel and light a candle for the forbidden saint.  Take the bus to Olintepeque at Quetzaltenango terminal. The trip will take only around 20 minutes to get to the village and the bus stops by the main plaza. There you can get off and walk toward the back of the church where you'll easily see the chapel.

51,Maximón,"Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala","Guatemalan womanizer, venerated during Holy Week.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maximon,"Maximón is not exactly the picture of a saint. Often portrayed with dark sunglasses and a bandit-style bandana, he looks more like a wild-west villain than a Central American saint. Yet his effigy resides in many homes in Western Guatemala and he is worshipped with careful attention. According to folk legend, when men left the village to work in the field, Maximón crept into town and slept with their wives. When the men found out, they returned and cut off all his limbs, leaving him behind as a womanizing torso. Besides his philandering, he was also well known for his bad habits of chain smoking and drinking heavily. Still, every year during Holy Week, an effigy of Maximón leaves his shrine and leads a procession through many villages in Guatemala. How exactly people in Guatemala began worshipping this borracho is unclear. Most believe his origins lie in pre-Colombian beliefs that fused with Catholicism over the years. Regardless of his beginnings, Maximón is a huge priority for many in Guatemala, and his worship is taken very seriously. Every year in villages that worship him, a home for an effigy of Maximón is chosen, and a shrine is erected. Usually, Maximón is depicted as very short, and often without his legs or arms. Although he is occasionally presented with flowers, it is also common for worshippers to place cigarettes, money and alcohol in front of his effigy, and to even pour alcohol into his mouth.

52,Pinula Aqueduct,"Guatemala City, Guatemala","It's not quite as old as its Roman appearance suggests, but this piece of infrastructure served Guatemala City for centuries.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pinula-aqueduct,"Following an earthquake in 1773, Guatemala decided to move its capital city from Antigua to a new location, one ostensibly safer from natural disaster. But the new chosen location needed a consistent water source. The nearest viable source of water was to be found from the Pinula River, some five miles from the city center. To transport the water, the architect José Bernardo Ramírez, who planned much of what would become Guatemala City, designed an aqueduct constructed of bricks and cement. He was inspired by the Oviedo Aqueduct in Spain, which itself was nearly two centuries old at that point. Construction was completed in 1786, and the aqueduct supplied water to the city for over 150 years, until more modern systems replaced it in 1938. Despite its long years of service, it had been damaged in earthquakes in 1917 and 1918. Besides its use in supplying water to the city, the aqueduct became a popular place for duels. One of the most important of these, in the mid-19th century, was to be between the then-President of Guatemala, General Rafael Carrera, and Marshal Serapio Cruz, who was plotting to carry out a coup d’etat. When word reached the President, he immediately challenged Cruz to a duel, which was to take place on the aqueduct. When the day came to fight, Cruz backed down, swearing that he had not been plotting anything, preserving the presidency of Carrera.  The aqueduct is viewable from many different points along the 20 calle and Boulevar Liberación in Zones 10, 13, and 14 of Guatemala City.",aqueducts waterworks infrastructure architecture

The murals surrounding the streets around the gallery represent the Mayan Calendar, textile designs, and sacred sites. They hold workshops regularly on painting, Mayan hieroglyphs, sculpture, and courses on Mayan Cosmovision. Inside the gallery, you can find paintings of local K’iche people, Mayan deities, and a shoemaker’s workshop. A 15-minute walk from the cemetery, this street offers a great view of the colorful and vibrant mausoleums. The gallery is also home to the twin brothers, who hold consultations on the Mayan calendar, fire ceremonies, and divination readings at their altar above the studio.  It is around a 7-minute walk from the Church of Santo Tomas.

54,Great Guatemalan Sinkhole,"Guatemala City, Guatemala","An enormous, 30-story-deep hole in the middle of Guatemala City.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-great-guatemalan-sinkhole-guatemala-city-guatemala,"Guatemala City has had experience with sinkholes before: In 2007, three people and a dozen homes here suddenly disappeared into the earth. But no one was prepared for anything like this. On Sunday, May 30, 2010, an enormous hole, 60 feet wide and 30 stories deep, opened up in the middle of Guatemala City, swallowing a three-story building, a home, and local reports claimed that one man was killed when the building was swallowed. Generally, sinkholes are caused by underground rivers or stores of water which erode bedrock and cause the ground above to collapse. Guatemala City is largely built on weak materials such as volcano pumice, however, and as such its sinkholes open extraordinarily quickly, leaving little time for escape. Most geologists are chalking the new sinkhole’s opening up to Tropical Storm Agatha. At least one specialist thinks the sinkhole may have been caused by broken underground pipes gushing water underneath the building, and Guatemalan officials are rushing to find the pipe, stop the leak, and fill in the hole, or else risk the hole widening. But getting construction crews to fill in a hole this large could take years, especially in the slums of Guatemala, where transportation is slow at best. With the risk of other sinkholes opening in the city “high,” according to National Geographic, Mayor Álvaro Arzú may have his hands (if not his sinkholes) full for awhile.  The sinkholes have largely been filled in.",disaster areas intriguing environs geological oddities ecosystems geology

While the concept of taking the whole family out for a hot bath at a public bathing establishment might seem like an odd notion to the average Westerner, the fact that the Baños Balcárcel has been going strong and pumping out millions of gallons of steaming hot bath water in the heart of Xela for the the past 125 years belies the fact that a warm bath, and indeed hot water itself, is still a relative luxury for the Maya of the Guatemalan highlands. Sundays at the Baños Balcárcel will see the place crawling with men, women, and children in traditional dress, having poured in from the highlands or the outskirts of Xela for the pleasures of a hot bath. A nominal fee will net you a half-hour’s worth of alone time with a well-used tiled tub and some scalding hot water piped in from a dumptruck-sized, wood-fired boiler out back. Indeed, once you’ve spent enough time under a central american electric shower head, the idea of forking over a few Quetzales to splash around in some truly hot water, even in a grimy old bathtub, does not seem like such a strange concept.

57,Hieroglyphic Stairway of Copán,"Copán Ruinas, Honduras",This staircase full of Mayan hieroglyphics is perhaps the largest single text in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hieroglyphic-stairway-of-copan,"The city of Copán in what is now western Honduras served as a political, civil, and religious center of the Mayan civilization for nearly 400 years. Although the site is host to a number of marvelous ruins, the most striking of them must be the epic stairway in the temple-pyramid of Structure 26. This construction, which forms the longest discovered Mayan text, was originally commissioned by the 14th governor of Copán, K’ak Joplaj Chan K’awiil, and eventually completed around 755 CE. At nearly 30 meters high and covered in around 2,000 glyphs, the etched pyramidal staircase is not only impressive due to its size and artistry. This collection of symbols offers a rare window into the rich history of the Copán Valley and the culture that ruled it for so many years. Researchers, first stumped by the hieroglyphs, came to realize that the staircase is a record of the royal history of Copán, listing the names of kings, their births, their deaths, and the defining events of their rule. The happy realization that the stones were arranged chronologically was somewhat tempered by the fact that early archaeologists — not 100% clear on Mayan syntax — had liberally rearranged the stone blocks in a 1930s attempt at reconstruction. Only the bottom 15 stairs remain in their original position. However, despite the jumble, modern archaeologists have figured out that the stairs document the rule of 16 kings, beginning with Yax K’uk Moh at the bottom step and ending with the death of a ruler known as “18 Rabbit” at the top. It is also believed that there is special emphasis on the story of the 12th king, K’ak Uti Ha K’awiil, whose burial plot was discovered inside the pyramid that supports the staircase. There is surely much left to be discovered in the ancient writings. While we wait for the next breakthrough, the stairway sits where it has been for millennia (but under a new cover for protection from the elements). It was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980.",mayan pyramids ruins
58,The Cave of the Glowing Skulls,Honduras,These Honduran caves earned their magical nickname thanks to reflective bone deposits.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-cave-of-the-glowing-skulls-honduras,"After the Talgua Caves in Honduras were discovered, they were renamed “The Cave of the Glowing Skulls” because of how the light reflected in the calcite deposits found in the bones of the burial cave. During the initial investigation following the discovery of the main ossuary chamber within the cave, another tunnel containing three passageways was also found. In the cave, they found 23 deposits containing skeletons ,at least 20 of which contained the remains of more than one person. All of the vestiges were described as appearing to be secondary burials that were moved from their initial burial sites. The bones were most likely packaged in cloth material and carried into the cave through an old entrance which no longer exists. All of the skeletal remains in the cave have long since been cemented to the ground by calcite. In addition to the human bones, there were also at least 20 intact ceramic vessels found in the cave. Researchers are still trying to discover who exactly lived in the cave, however numerous links between the people of Talgua has helped them determine that the site was definitively not a Mayan site. Nowadays the Talgua Caves are open to the public, but the sites where the glowing bones were discovered are still under investigation.",skeletons bones caves archaeology ecosystems
59,Rosalila Temple,"Copán Ruinas, Honduras",A full-size replica of this well-preserved temple lets you take a walk through the Mayan age.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rosalila-temple,"This amazingly well-preserved Mayan temple was found in an excellent state of preservation from the base up to the roof, including its highly elaborated painted stucco decoration. Unlike other buildings archaeologists have found, the ancient Mayans did not destroy Rosalila. Instead, it was carefully, and ceremoniously buried. Its rooms, moldings, and niches were carefully filled with mud and stones, while its elaborate stucco panels were covered with a thick layer of white plaster, which still protects much of the original paint. Rosalila was the principal religious sanctuary at Copán in the late 6th century CE. When it was discovered, numerous artifacts were found that reflect the several practices the Mayans once performed at the site. Among the remains found at the site were seven ceramic incense burners with charcoal still inside, two of which lay upon sculpted, stone jaguar pedestals; offerings of flint knives (for sacrificing); nine elaborate, ceremonial scepters, wrapped in the remnants of a deep blue bag or cloth; carved jade jewelry; conch shells; stingray spines (used for blood-letting rites); shark vertebrae; jaguar claws; and remains of flower petals and pine needles. Some of these remains (particularly the incense burners and the flowers) recall religious practices still in use among the modern Maya. Due to the deforestation of the Copán valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration. The tradition was discontinued due to the vast quantities of firewood required, which could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has also been built at the Copán site museum so that you can experience what it would have looked like when it was in use.",ancient cults mayan temples ruins

The Lancetilla Botanical Gardens are divided into two main areas: an arboretum with a sample of different tropical species from around the world and a tropical forest preserve with native trees and plants. There’s also an impressive natural tunnel made from bamboo. The Wilson Popenoe Arboretum, named in honor of its first Director of Tropical Agricultural Experiments, boasts the largest collection of Asian plants in the Mesoamerican region, with 636 different species. Popenoe is regarded as the pioneer of tropical horticulture in this Caribbean landscape and selected the valley of Lancetilla for his arboretum because of the area’s microclimate diversity. Tragically, Popenoe’s wife Dorothy died in the botanical garden in 1932 after eating unripe, uncooked ackee fruit. The soil of Lancetilla is a source for various seeds, including the African oil palm, rubber tree, rambutan, and Central America’s beloved lemon tea. The gardens are also a great place for bird-watching, with 331 species recorded to date including year-round residents as well as North American migratory species.  It's located about three miles outside of the town of Tela (on the north coast of Honduras), right off the main CA-13 highway and is open daily. Local guides are available on-site for tours. There's also a cafeteria for meal purchases and cabins for overnight stays.",botanical tunnels seed banks tropical botanical gardens fruit places to stay birds gardens plants animals
62,Lluvia de Peces (Rain of Fish),"Yoro, Honduras",Fish raining from the sky are the cause of a yearly celebration in this small Honduran town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lluvia-de-peces-the-rain-of-fish,"Known as the Lluvia de Peces or “Rain of Fish,” it is said to occur at least once and sometimes twice in a year in the small town of Yoro: during a massive rain storm, hundreds of small silver fish supposedly rain from the sky onto the streets of the small town. Said to have been happening in the town since the 1800s in the months of May or June, each year a large storm rolls through the town with a very heavy rain, and once the storm has passed, the streets are found flapping and flopping, full of small, still-living fish. In the 1970s, a National Geographic team actually witnessed the event, making it one of the few credible sightings of such a phenomenon, though proof that the fish were coming from the sky and not another source remained elusive. Known as “animal rain,” this weather phenomenon has been reported around the world for centuries, though the scientific understanding of it still remains sketchy. In 1823, explorer and botanist Alexander Von Humbolt wrote of the 1698 volcanic eruption of Mt. Carihuairazo which apparently also covered forty-three square miles the surrounding country with mud and fish (possibly from an underground lake connected to the volcano). By and large, reports of animal rain generally concern fish and frogs, but other, far more disturbing reports have told of birds, snakes, foot-long alligators, jellyfish, mice, spiders, and even a “rain of flesh and blood.” In some reports, the animals are already dead when they come crashing to earth, while in others, they are alive, and those that survive the fall—though surely discombobulated—hop or flop away. The simplest explanation for these animal rains is that large rainstorms force certain animals out of their homes or flood rivers, causing them to fill the streets. Another simple explanation is that a flash flood can deposit fish far from their waters before quickly drying up, leaving spectators to believe that the animals must have come down with the rains. While these may be the source of many animal rain reports, the Northern Territory News of Australia reported in February 2010 “that food falling from the sky is more than a legend. It was reported that on Feb. 25 and 26, fish landed like rain on Lajamanu, Australia, 200 miles from the coast.” Like the rain of fish in Yoro, it seems that, while extremely rare, animals do occasionally fall from the sky. The likely scientific explanation for this is elegantly simple—waterspouts. Waterspouts are like little tornadoes which form over a body of water. Though waterspouts do not suck water up into the air (the “spout” is actually condensation), the whirlwind of waterspouts and tornadoes have the ability to lift small animals from the water and into the air, in which cases they can be carried quite far from their bodies of water and released somewhere else. And some tornadoes actually have the ability to suck up entire ponds. Overall, this hypothesis makes a lot of sense considering that most animal rains consist of aquatic creatures. (In the case of reports of “bird rains,” the explanation is different—a flock of one species is overtaken by a particularly sudden and strong wind, blown around for a bit, killed, and, as the wind dissipates, falls from the sky. This also accounts for what might be the most horrific animal rain—the rain of blood and flesh. In this case, the birds are so badly battered that they come down in pieces. Any other animal sucked up into a violent storm could also come back to earth as guts. Although there are also cases where the “rains of blood” have turned out to be made by red dust, a very simple explanation.) In Yoro, the explanation often offered up is a religious rather than a scientific one. Father Jose Manuel Subirana, a Catholic priest living in the area, prayed that God provide sustenance to the hungry peoples, and, at the end of his marathon prayer session, it is said to have rained small fish. The festival, which began in 1998, is held in honor of the miracle that is the Lluvia de Peces, and a parade is held where effigies of Father Jose Manuel Subirana are carried through the streets. Among the most mysterious elements of the Departmento de Yoro “Rain of Fish” is that the fish themselves are not local to the area and may be coming from as far away as the Atlantic Ocean some 200 km away, presumably brought by waterspouts sucking them into the sky. A less exciting theory postulates that the fish live in underground rivers and are actually being forced up from onto the streets rather than falling down onto them. This hypothesis is supported by the 1970s National Geographic’s teams finding that the fish are completely blind.",weird weather phenomena festivals natural wonders water nature animals
63,Fortress of San Fernando de Omoa,"Omoa, Honduras","This fortress in Honduras was built to resist pirates, but its builders had more to fear from the British.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortress-of-san-fernando-de-omoa,"Omoa, a city located on a small bay on the Caribbean Sea coast of Honduras, is home to an 18th century Spanish fort, built for protection from the pirates raiding the Atlantic Ocean. The fortress of San Fernando de Omoa was constructed between 1756 through 1775 and measures 4,400 square meters. However, by the time the large building project was complete, the pirate attacks in the region had dwindled. Either lured by fairer treasure-hunting prospects elsewhere or intimidated by the stone stronghold, the dreaded raiders never appeared. Due to the distinct lack of pirates, it was an untested group of Spanish guards that were suddenly besieged by British forces on October 16th, 1779 (Spain had just entered the American Revolutionary War, fighting on the American side). A small crew of 150 British soldiers and sailors quickly captured San Fernando de Omoa, losing only six of their men in the process. The craters from the British cannons are still visible on the fort’s walls. Although their marks persist to this day, the British themselves didn’t stick around too long. The victors held the fort only until that November, when they withdrew before a Spanish counterattack could arrive. Over the following years, the fortress lay like a sleeping giant. It was abandoned for several years before being converted to a prison, which it remained until 1870, before being abandoned again. In 1959, the Honduran government committed to a restoration project, which has made the old Spanish garrison a proper tourist site.

Each year, on the morning Good Friday, devout citizens of Comayagua, Honduras take to the streets to create temporary “Alfombras” (or “carpets”) depicting religious scenes. Using nothing but colored sawdust and other powders, the religious revelers create hundreds of intricately detailed and wonderfully colorful designs. These carpets, despite the skill and work put into them, only last a scant nine hours before they’re stamped out by a holy march marking the stations of the cross. Each carpet carries an evangelistic message and is designed freehand on cardboard molds. The sawdust is dyed with aniline to give it the vivid colors. The artful designs are financed by different families or local businesses who sometimes put their logo in the finished design. This modern tradition actually only started in 1963 when one Miriam Elvira Mejia Rivera de Zapata created a sawdust carpet depicting a lamb outside Comayagua’s cathedral to commemorate the inauguration of the new bishop. Despite the tradition’s fairly contemporary origins in the town the making of sawdust carpets dates back to pre-Hispanic times and was later co-opted by the Christian faith.

Trujillo was a Spanish colony at the time. It was Christopher Columbus’s last stop in the New World in 1502 and is the oldest colonized city in Honduras. After driving away or enslaving the local inhabitants, Spaniards set up a tenuous city that would survive centuries of plagues, pirate attacks, and natural disasters to become the sleepy tourist spot it is today. A few minutes walk from the city center is the Cementerio Viejo (Old Cemetery), where early inhabitants of Trujillo were buried, their crumbling graves listing provenances like France and Palestine. One of these graves reads simply: “William Walker: Shot by Firing Squad, September 12, 1860.” Walker was a notorious U.S. “filibuster,” a term that described a group of men in the fledgling United States who would raise private armies to invade foreign countries and claim rule over them without any authorization. Walker, the preeminent filibuster of his day, had first seized Lower California in Mexico in 1853 and then overthrew the Nicaraguan government and named himself President of Nicaragua. He later arrived in Honduras seeking to incite rebellion and establish an English-speaking government there with himself at the helm. This time, however, Walker’s plot would not succeed. Captured by British forces and turned over to Honduran authorities, he was sentenced to death by firing squad. His grave today is neatly kept, fenced off from anyone walking through the Old Cemetery and easily overlooked by those unaware of this strange chapter of colonial history.

It takes about an hour to hike up the hill, with rewarding views at the top, and an exhilarating one-minute slide back down to the bottom. The way down is the most exciting part. One path is made of smooth volcanic sand instead of coarse rocky terrain. It is too steep to climb but perfect for descent. It takes less than a couple of minutes to run down the slope, and thrill seekers “volcano-board” to the base on wooden sleds. The path can also provide a slow, casual walk for those who just want to take in the scenery. The only route to the summit is a steep, naturally paved trail. At the top is a trail around the rim of the crater, which often emits smoke. A stunning 360-degree panoramic view reveals the chain of active and dormant volcanoes, lined up one after the other, surrounded by blue skies and lush green foliage.  The Cerro Negro can be reached by taking the bypass road from León that leads to the highway to Chinandega. Only a couple of kilometers from León there is a sign pointing to Lechecuagos, a rural community, and there is also a sign that indicates the Cerro Negro. From here the road is unpaved and signs are set up in the direction of the volcano. Sometimes road signs are missing in this maze of sandy paths, so be sure to ask around whenever the direction is not clear.If you don't want to climb Cerro Negro on your own you can also book a tour with one of the hostels/hotels or tour agencies in Leon.

73,El Fortín de Acosasco,"León, Nicaragua",This hilltop fort is a dark holdover from one of Latin America's bloodiest dictatorships.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-fortin-de-acosasco,"Perched on a low hilltop, with airy views of the city of León and the Cordillera de Maribios mountain range to the north, this ruined fortress would appear to be a postcard-pretty spot for a picnic. Yet few day-trippers come—and no wonder. Hidden in the weeds lies a macabre chronicle of torture and death. Acosasco Fortress was erected in 1889-90 under the administration of Roberto Sacasa, the conservative president of Nicaragua who was seeking to guard against liberal attacks from the coast. It quickly fell into disuse, and was abandoned in the 1930s. In the 1960s, it reopened under the dictatorship of Anastasio (“Tachito”) Somoza Debayle. Somoza had long had León in his crosshairs. The city was historically a hotbed of intellectual disquiet, with a legacy of leftist conspiracies that had come to bloody fruition in 1956 when the dictator’s father, Anastasio Somoza García, was gunned down by a 27-year-old poet at a dance hall. After Somoza’s son was installed as the new despot, the fortress was reconditioned as a detention center for anyone branded a “subversive.” It wasn’t long after that strange rumors started floating in the city’s cafés and back rooms. The rumors told of unspeakable goings-on on the hilltop: torture, disappearing of political enemies, clandestine executions. The National Guard, Somoza’s feared secret police, had taken to patrolling the streets at night, hauling away anyone suspected of being a political dissident. The next day, their bodies would reappear, lifeless, on Acosasco’s slopes. In a few cases, children stumbled upon the cabbage-white skulls bobbing amid the grass, and the ridge became dubbed “the cabbage patch.” In 1979, the fortress was finally forced to render up its secrets. After several weeks of desperate fighting beginning in mid-May, rebels of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) succeeded in retaking León, as part of their final push to overthrow the Somoza dynasty. Obligated to fall back to the fortress, the National Guard made one last stand before being evacuated to the coast on Bell Iroquois helicopters. The Sandinistas entered Fort Acosasco on June 7, 1979. They would take Managua six weeks later, on July 19. Today, the fort preserves an uneasy stillness. There are few visitors to disturb the cicadas chirping in the weeds. Yet the concrete walls still exhibit the same grim implements the Sandinistas found when they first breached the cellblocks back in ‘79. Along the south face, sunlight seeps into tiny stalls (“las chiquitas”) used to asphyxiate a dozen men in a shower-sized space. Outside, noon heat bakes the concrete slabs of “the Oven,” a sarcophagus-like trench where prisoners were broiled alive. Water torture, electrocution: other areas of the fort served similarly horrid ends. In recent years, ex-Sandinistas have lobbied to refurbish Acosasco, to turn it into a memorial to their years of struggle. Doubtless they’re right. Yet no amount of paint and plaster can dispel the evil aura that envelops this hilltop. Its bad energy testifies to the dark via crucis still being traversed by their beautiful, blood-stained country, the Nicaragua of mountains and martyrs.  The fortress is located approximately 1.5 miles southwest of León’s Parque Central, on the southern edge of the Sutiaba district. The road to the top winds considerably, so the best way to go is to take a taxi.",torture dictators fortresses forts politics death
74,La Chureca,"Managua, Nicaragua",The largest garbage dump in all of Central America is home to a tragic community that make their living from the refuse.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-chureca,"Located in Nicaragua, the municipal landfill known as La Chureca (slang for “city dump”) is a massive open dumpster that has attracted a community of extremely impoverished citizens who came to the land to make a living and simply never left. Located on four square miles of land in Managua, Nicaragua, the huge dump site was established shortly after an earthquake destroyed a majority of the city in the early 1970’s. The rubble and waste was brought to the site, creating what is now the largest landfill in Central America. Soon after it was created impoverished citizens of the nearby areas began coming to the landfill to see what scraps or valuables they could sift from the detritus. As the landfill grew, so did the number of scavengers. While most of the workers reporting to the landfill would simply arrive for the day and then leave when they had finished, some began to simply stay at the site, soon growing to a permanent community. Some created makeshift hovels out of the garbage while others build larger homes complete with fences and gardens. The group of permanent residents eventually grew to over a thousand members who would venture out into the sea of trash to look for valuable pieces of metal or plastic to sell or use in their constructions, or simply look for food. At one point, the population of “Churequeros,” as they are known was almost 50% under the age of eighteen, and lived facing the constant threats of disease, wild animals, poisons and a host of other terrible conditions that all came along with living in a garbage dump. Recent years have seen some improvement with the creation of a processing and recycling plant which now employs and houses hundreds of the people living on the site.",landfills disaster areas disasters

However, for Alberto Gutiérrez, this has been about much more than living the life of a hermit. He has spent much of his life etching brilliant carvings into rocks, and is popularly known as the “’The Hermit of Estelí’.” Alberto has hand carved pictures of all kinds into the rockface. Several random rocks along the path feature carvings of faces and various shapes. Once visitors climb a few steps, they are then greeted by what Alberto has spent most of his life designing. Elephants, birds, and life-sized anacondas are just a few of the representations he has carved into the rock. There are also carvings of cathedrals, the Twin Towers, and the ships used by Christopher Columbus. All of which were designed by hand. There are a few pathways to follow, and a couple of benches to sit and admire the stunning scenery.

Today, the islands offer a beautiful excursion into the lake. The islets range in size between 100 square meters and over 100 hectares. The wild nature, resident birds and visitors, and the day-a-day routine of the locals make it an ideal place for a boat ride or kayaking. Most are covered in vegetation and are occupied with private homes and hotels. Some of the bigger islands are home to resorts equipped with pools and their own electric power source. Lake Nicaragua, also known as Cocibolca, is the largest freshwater lake in Central America. Geologists believe that it, along with the nearby Lake Managua, was once part of an ocean bay but a volcanic eruption led to a change in the landscape that cut them off from the coast. The Isletas de Granada are those on the northwest shore, closest to the city of Granada.

Mother nature holds a magnifying glass over those that explore the market, increasing the potency of its rays. The ruthless heat beats down on the bronzed bodies of the campesinos and their assistants as they wheel overloaded handtrucks of produce to the dozens of cubicles that line the walkway of a massive green farmhouse. The movement here never stops. Amidst the chaos heavily armed police in their berets and sand colored camouflage uniforms point and shout instructions to the lines of trucks and shoppers. The smell is a mix of fresh produce and motor oil. The scent your nose receives depends entirely on which way the breeze blows. Inside the warehouse, the workers pass back and forth by a lifeless Coca-Cola machine that at one time provided a fresh supply of water bottles to the thirsty passersby. In the cubicles, men and women sit perfecting the presentation of their limes, carrots, cucumbers, potatoes, bananas, onions, tomatoes, lemons, garlic, cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, yams, pineapples, watermelons, and avocados. Both English and Spanish are used to entice shoppers into checking out their product. Everything is sold by the pound. There’s no bartering here. “Golaso!” echoes from the radio in one cubicle. Comparatively speaking, the market is quiet on Monday mornings, but you can imagine the hundreds of locals that flock here on a Sunday afternoon. Outside the farmhouse, trucks circle the gray sludge road searching for an open spot to unload their contents. Impatient drivers honk obnoxiously at any vehicle that remains unmoving for more than a minute. A white pickup truck pulls up with a bed full of pineapples wrapped in a net large enough to catch thousands of trout. At lunch time, the workers escape to the many shanty town restaurants that dot the area around the farm house.

Nonetheless people have lived in the area for centuries, even with the possible threat of eruption. But there is something else unusual happening in el Valle. Unique in the entire world to this Panamanian crater, a group of cottonwood trees have grown with square trunks. With hard right angles, rarely seen in nature, the trees have baffled visitors. Even the “rings,” of the interior tree grow in a square shape and not the typical circle, making the trees truly stick out in nature’s typical curvilinear palette. Researchers at the University of Florida attempted to grow the trees to see if they would retain their square shapes. From their research, it became evident that the trees are shaped by the local conditions, and can exist only in the Valley of Square Trees.

You have the option to camp or stay in a bedroom attached to his house and will likely run into the enormous troop of capuchin monkeys swinging through the trees. Dave has no formal training or grant/government support for his endeavors, but spends his time, effort, and money dedicated to the cause. He regularly arranges for educational school trips to visit his preserve, but as he states on his website, anyone is welcome to come. “If you show up,” the information page states, “we will find space for you.” Every night he sets out to go on patrol to ensure that poachers are not disturbing turtles nesting on the beach. Dave has constructed his own hatchery after coming across many dead mothers and babies. Located right on the beach, this hatchery safe guards Olive Ridley, Leatherback, Hawksbill, Loggerhead and Green turtle eggs until they’re ready to hatch. During a visit, turtles may hatch and scuttle to the shore right in front of your eyes. A visit to Tigre Salvaje is a truly unique, off-the-beaten-path adventure that gives you a sharper look into turtle conservation efforts in Panama and how one individual can have an incredible impact. Dave’s meticulous note-taking is a wonder in and of itself. Go during nesting season (April-October). You can email Dave directly and ask him if he's in the area. Sometimes, he heads to the US Virgin Islands for extended periods of time, particularly during the off season.

Finished in 1866 by German inventor Julius Kroehl, the Sub Marine Explorer was a wonder of contemporary naval design. Despite being hand-powered, the long, “cigar-shaped” vessel contained pressurized working compartments for passengers and a sophisticated-for-the-time ballast system which allowed the ship to take on water to sink and use pressurized air to rise. The Explorer was known to dive more than 100 feet below the surface for hours at a time, an unmitigated success save for the strange “fever” that seemed to afflict the sailors after dives. The boat ran proof of concept trials for just one year until Kroehl himself died of the mysterious fever which is now known to have been violent decompression sickness, otherwise called “the bends.” Despite the universal sickness that afflicted the early passengers of the vessel, its revolutionary operating technology caused critics to overlook the strange illness and the ship was set to work as a diving ship among Panama’s Pearl Islands. However, the fatal sickness continued to claim the lives of the submarine’s crew and soon the historic ship was simply lost and forgotten. However, the severely rusting hull of the Sub Marine Explorer was finally rediscovered in 2001 by randomly passing archeologist, James Delgado. The ship is in a severe state of decay after more than a century of neglect, but joint efforts from America and Panama are being discussed to preserve the important, if deadly, piece of maritime history.",submarines shipwrecks ships water ruins

Surrounded on all sides by Panama City, Ancon Hill is a tiny pocket of jungle wilderness in a rapidly industrializing and burgeoning urban center, capped off by a giant Panamanian flag. For most of the 20th century until 1977, the United States was in possession of Ancon Hill. Choosing not to develop the land, but instead use the 650-foot high hill for radio communications, the Americans stubbornly held onto the slopes while the rest of Panama City developed locally. Because of this long period of non-growth, Ancon Hill has remained a 106-acre jungle in the midst of a city of 1.2 million people. When the Panamanians finally got their land back through the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977, they hoisted a Panamanian flag over the hill. The flag is now visible from almost everywhere in Panama City. Although the Panamanians received an untouched piece of land, local entities have slowly begun to develop the land, and the jungle has taken on a more residential atmosphere. Yet even though most of the land has been sold, Ancon Hill has managed to retain a bit of its wilderness. Besides a few developments, the slopes are also home to sloths, tamarins, coati and armadillos, and these wondrous animals are a main draw for many joggers and hikers in the area. Along with jungle creatures, the hill offers stunning views over the city and the Bridge of the Americas.  Accessible from a public access road that begins behind the Panama Canal Administration Building, or stop at Mi Pueblito, no need to buy a ticket just start walking up the road, then the stairs back onto the road.

83,Black Christ of Portobelo,"Portobelo, Panama",A mysterious dark-skinned Christ statue has been this town's religious center for centuries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/black-christ-of-portobelo,"The legendary depiction of Jesus Christ known as the Black Christ of Portobelo mixes issues of race and religion together with a mythic origin story to create one of the world’s most singular Christian devotional items. The true origins of the Black Christ are actually unknown. According to legend, the statue itself may have been a miracle. As the story goes, a black slave was fishing in the town when he saw a large object floating in the water. After dragging the mysteriously wrapped hulk ashore, he unwrapped it view of a number of onlookers. The Black Christ figure seemed like a personal appearance of Christ to many of the locals who felt that the statue’s appearance was a signal that Jesus was with them in a very concrete sense. This veneration was rewarded and verified as a plague that was sweeping the area seemed to disappear just as the Christ figure arrived in their town. Wherever the statue came from, it was placed in The Iglesia de San Felipe where it has remained ever since. To honor the miraculous deeds of the inanimate Christ, a feast and festival has been held each October for the last handful of centuries. During the festival pilgrims hike for miles into Portobelo, many donning ceremonial robes and crawling the final mile to the church in honor the Christ figure. The Black Christ itself has its clothing changed (one of only twice a year this happens) and it is carried on the grateful arms of the faithful across the short distance the figure was originally dragged from the sea. The distance may be short, but the manner in which the procession moves follows a strange stunted set of steps (three forward, two back) that prolongs the ceremony. The Black Christ is then returned to the church at midnight. It is actually said that the Black Christ of Portobelo cannot be returned to the church prior to midnight, saying the figure simply becomes too heavy to carry for a time.",mystery churches monuments sacred spaces statues

Its unusual architectural style is difficult to miss. From the valley, it looks like a giant white egg perched atop a hill. This building was the first Baha’i Temple in Latin America. It was inaugurated in 1972 to serve Panama residents of the Bahá’í Faith, a religion that encourages universal peace and unity. Of the locals who know of the temple, it seems that few have visited. Even some tour guides cannot find it. A winding mile-long driveway leads from the busy Transistmica Highway up to the temple. Once there, you’ll enter the building through one of the 3-D, wave-shaped gates. Overhead, the dome arches like a huge umbrella, shading you from the hot sun. Inside, while sitting on a wooden bench, the noise and chaos of the city seem far away. Distant traffic noise becomes a faint background to the cheerful chirping of small birds who fly freely through the building. A balcony circles the spacious sanctuary. Fin-like structures radiate outwards like nine star points, their broad ends supporting both the balcony and dome overhead. This design guides the breeze through the building, acting as a natural air-conditioning. The city, at sea level, is hot and humid. But up here, the temperature is comfortable. There is an organic feeling to the design, which uses so many curved lines. Most churches in the city are rectangular, their decorations beautiful but ornate. This one takes a more modest approach. A path circles the building, and there is a small garden suitable for a walking meditation if you are so inclined. Time spent here can be refreshing. You’ll get a different view of Panama City, the coastal developments, and the surrounding areas. You’ll be able to return to the city rejuvenated, ready to enjoy the experiences it has to offer.  The temple rarely has many visitors, although it is free and open to the public from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day. Children may find it dull as they must stay under your control. There are no play areas. Beyond the paths, the lawn ends suddenly in steep slopes. You may sit, pray, or meditate as you wish or just walk around. Only if you show interest will an attendant discuss the Baha'i religion. Bring sun protection, such as a hat and sunscreen. Also bring water.

At Parque Urraca, shouts of “safe, out, ball and strike” ring out from the diaphragms of players who have congregated to enjoy their Sunday afternoon playing one of Panama’s most beloved pastimes. Though an American game, this diamond has a culture all its own. Surrounding the dirt and gravel infield is a lead fence, rusted orange in the spots most exposed to the rain. Young boys imitate the batting stances of their fathers on the deteriorating blue wooden bleachers that surround the fence. The boys are not the only spectators. In the outfield birds nibble at the lunch leftovers of the construction workers who spend their days here restoring the park’s water pipes. The right fielder must be the most athletic of the defense as catching a ball in his area of the field requires navigating the giant holes, orange cones, yellow caution tape, porter potties and metal tubes of the construction zone. Dotting the first and third base lines are palm trees, a reminder that the Pacific Ocean rests only a half mile from the edge of the outfield. The gringos that traverse the sidewalks around the field have a decent enough view of the action, but the best views are from the upper-most rooms of the magnificent gold and black high-rises that stand at the edge of the third base line.

If one is adventurous enough to skip the bus tours, water taxis, or cab rides, an excellent option is to rent a motor scooter or ATV to explore the beaches and bluffs. Just off the main road that takes you through the center of Isla Colon, the largest of the islands, there is a cave called la Gruta. La Gruta is considered a religious site for many people on the island. While many caves have tour guides, gift shops, and lights, la Gruta has no such amenities. A simple box at the entrance requests a dollar on the honor system for entry, and that’s it. Once you have made it past the entrance, you will discover an outdoor church that is still used by locals. Directly to the right of the pulpit, you will find a small statue of Nuestra Señora de la Gruta sitting outside the entrance to the cave. Entering the caves takes you into water that is roughly ankle deep. Further inside, the water easily comes up to your chest. There is minimal light at that point, and a headlamp is highly necessary, especially considering the fact that some of the local caiman (the small ones) like to bathe in the dark waters. Right next door to la Gruta there is an intentional community. If you are lucky enough to bump into any of the inhabitants, they are lovely people and have coco butter or dried coconut chips for sale (try the pina colada variety!).

The heated water flows down the river unless it gets diverted into one of the several human-made pools. They’re a splendid spot for a hot soak on a crisp, cool day. Some say the baths have healing properties. As such, you may see some locals arriving to bathe there and reap the water’s alleged health benefits. The pools are off the beaten path, though, so you can still expect a fair amount of privacy. The area surrounding the old bridge and the hot springs is stunning. Walking atop the stone overpass is a great way to soak in the views. The river carves through a beautiful gorge, backdropped by distant mountains that stretch toward the sky.

Starting as a Soviet ally, Hoxha declared the USSR to be revisionist and anti-Marxist after the death of Stalin, and soon all of the Warsaw Pact nations ended their allegiance with Albania. Hoxha then took China as Albania’s ally, which only lasted until 1977, after which he tried to make the country self-sufficient. During his control of the country, Hoxha banned religion, foreign travel, and often used his secret police to stop any dissent. Almost a quarter of the budget went to the military, much of it spent on building bunkers. The prototype for the bunkers was built in the 1950s, with the chief engineer assuring Hoxha that it would withstand a full assault from a tank. Hoxha decided to test it, with the engineer inside, and when he emerged unscathed from the attack mass production began. Fearing an invasion from his former Soviet allies or NATO, Hoxha had enough concrete and steel bunkers built to stop an army of millions. They grew like sinister gray mushrooms from the mountains to the coastline, sprouting up in neighborhoods, fields, playgrounds, cemeteries, and on beaches. They created a permanent sense of paranoia for Albanians who encountered their sniper windows at every turn; but the enemy never came. Decades after the end of Hoxha’s totalitarian regime, the bunkers still scar the landscape. While a few have been turned into hotels or homes by creative Albanians, most are abandoned and overtaken by weeds, only occupied by the desperate in search of shelter. They clutter Albania’s hilly landscape, dotting nearly every view in the small country’s 11,100 square miles. The years of communist isolation followed by uncontrolled capitalism have left Albania one of Europe’s poorest countries. Each bunker costs about 800 euro to destroy, and there is roughly one bunker per every four Albanians. In 2009, T-59s, a Chinese version of a Soviet-era tank, were rolled onto the Albanian beaches to destroy some of the bunkers that were threatening the safety of the people they were built to protect. Several people had drowned in the whirlpools created by streams around the bunkers, and the concrete was eroding and cracking from the ocean waves. Even with their removal, they are a tiny percentage of the bunkers that watch over the country as it attempts to move out from the shadow of Enver Hoxha.",communist architecture bunkers military history military architectural oddities architecture

Originally built in the 12th century, the castle looks markedly different than it did upon its initial construction thanks to additions provided by Albania’s many political leaders. The first of the defenses were put in place by the Despots of Epirus, an off-shoot of the Byzantine government, who established the basic towered structure of the castle. Later on, while the area was under Ottoman rule, the site was extensively renovated and built upon, bringing the site to a sort of regality that it hadn’t enjoyed since its creation centuries prior. In the 1800’s, a clock tower and aqueduct were also added. In the 1930’s the fantastically named Zog, King of the Albanians converted the fortress into a prison, adding a number of cells and fortifications to hold members of the various resistance forces acting in the country during his reign. Today, the fort sits on top of a hill that towers over the surrounding town making it a striking monument to the grandeur of the past. The site continued to operate as a prison until 1968, and now the castle complex is operated as a historical site, including an arms museum devoted to the weapons of Albania’s independence. Even outside of the museum proper the castles halls are sprinkled with abandoned World War II tanks, and there is even an American fighter plane that was shot down during the war that sits next to one of the towers as a reminder of the struggle against Western influence. All of the dictators and war aside, the small field atop the castle roof is also now home to a concert pavilion that hosts festival entertainment each year, and is generally a more exuberant and positive place than much of the rest of the castle.",castles world war ii military museums and collections museums
91,Krujë Castle,"Krujë, Albania","The elliptical citadel resisted the advance of the mighty Ottomans several times, thanks to the military prowess of the ""Dragon of Albania.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kruje-castle,"When the powerful Ottoman empire was slowly taking over several parts of Europe during the 15th century, one small medieval castle in Albania remained out of its reach. Krujë castle was built in the 5th or 6th century, perched above the city of the same name. At the time of the Ottoman threat, it was the headquarters of Gjergj Kastrioti, the “Dragon of Albania,” an Albanian nobleman and military commander. Kastrioti was sent as a hostage to the Ottoman court early in his life, and after leaving service, led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in Albania. Under his command, the elliptical castle, defended by a small army usually no larger than 3,000 men, fought off multiple massive sieges from the Turks, beginning in 1444. Ottoman forces who conquered large areas like Constantinople and the Balkans could not break the castle’s defences. Kastrioti’s military skills presented a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion into Western Europe. The Ottoman Turks gave him the name Iskender bey, meaning “Lord Alexander” or “Leader Alexander” (which has been translated as Skanderbeg in English), believed to be no less than a comparison to Alexander the Great. The Albanian stronghold finally fell, ten years after the “dragon’s” death in 1468, and was taken over by the Ottoman ruler Sultan Mehmed II. The castle now contains a museum dedicated to this legendary Albanian leader. The exhibits of have been arranged in a way that chronicles Skanderbeg’s life and military achievements, one of the proudest periods of Albanian history. An important display is the replica of the Arms of Skanderbeg: his famous goat head-topped helmet and sword. In front of the museum are the remains of an Ottoman-era mosque and its minaret, Sultan Mehmed Fatih mosque, named after the man who finally broke down the castle’s security. A traditional home in the castle complex, below the Skanderbeg Museum, houses the Ethnographic Museum. The museum is located in an original 19th century house that belonged to the wealthy Toptani family. It shows the level of self-sufficiency the household maintained by producing its own food, drink and household artifacts. The home’s luxury is well presented with the walls lined with frescoes, intricately carved woodwork, colourfully painted furniture and the house’s own mini Turkish bath (hammam). On the road to leading up to the castle stands a section of a 450-year-old bazaar, that in its heyday, saw more than 150 merchants selling their goods to the castle’s visitors and residents. It now sells traditional crafts and antiques. Krujë is a city perched on a mountainside therefore it is suitable for drivers experienced in driving using handbrakes and on narrow serpentine roads.",empire mosques royalty castles medieval war history houses homes military museums and collections museums
92,Tirana's Colorful Facade,"Tirana, Albania",What happens when you cross a mayor and a painter?,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/color-buildings-of-tirana,"All across the former communist states of eastern Europe, drab, boxy buildings dominate the landscape. Some cities like Prague at least have the massive, apartment complexes contained in the suburbs, but Tirana was not quite so lucky. At least not until Edi Rama became the mayor, and gave Albania’s capital city a vibrant makeover. Before he was mayor, Rama was an international success in painting. Although always political, Rama had held more exhibitions than political offices by the time he became mayor in 2000, and he approached his new found job with a keen artistic sensibility. After just a few weeks in office, Rama jumped headlong into a cosmetic attack on his city. He removed illegal buildings, built new parks and most importantly began a painting campaign. Flashing his brush across many of Tirana’s old apartment buildings and communist-style high rises, Rama added color and design across the city. Some of the buildings are striped in reds, blues and greens while others feature designs that sprawl across their entire facades. Despite criticism that Rama failed to address the more pressing problems of Tirana, the city is certainly eye-catching and uniquely modern.",outsider architecture outsider art architectural oddities architecture
93,Bunk'Art,"Tirana, Albania","Once the fallout shelter of a dictator, this sprawling bunker is now a combined history museum and contemporary art gallery.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunkart,"Underneath Tiranë, the capital of Albania, there is a five-story bunker of spidery hallways and over 100 rooms. Originally codenamed “Objekti Shtylla,” the shelter was built in the 1970s under the orders and direction of Enver Hoxha, communist leader of Albania for over four decades. What was once intended to protect Hoxha and his cabinet in the event of a nuclear attack is now a mixed-use art and culture center, but with a keen eye towards preservation and remembrance of the dark years under Hoxha’s rule. Known as Bunk’Art, 24 rooms of the sprawling shelter have been converted into a history museum and contemporary art gallery, the result of the combined efforts of the Albanian government and a nonprofit art collective called Qendra Ura or “Center Bridge.” Inside are living quarters and meeting rooms, staged as they would have been at the time, for Hoxha, his officers, and their soldiers. One room, originally the dictator’s own office (it’s a little swankier than the other quarters) even playing his voice on a loop if you pick up the phone receiver and listen. Hoxha died a few years before the bunker was completed, and it was never actually put into service. It was completely unknown the public, the only way in and out from inside the secretive ministry. In order to open it up, in 2014 entrance and exit tunnels were built, which add to an anticipatory eerie quality when visiting. But once inside there is a world of bright and evocative contemporary art, right alongside the stark fallout rooms and photographic displays. In addition to providing space for visual artists, the old bunker theater is used for frequent concerts, lectures, and other events. You can see additional photographs, and find out more about the bunker, here.  Bunk'Art is on the eastern edge of Tiranë in central Albania. They are generally open from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm.

The first fortification on the hill overlooking the town was constructed by Illyrian tribes as early as the 9th-century BCE. Since then, the area has been conquered by many different peoples and countries. The Romans took the fort in a battle in 168 BCE and later passed it down to the Byzantine Empire. After some centuries of local rule, the Venetians took the area and rebuilt the ruined fortress and a Catholic church. The castle was sieged twice by the Ottomans, who conquered it in 1479, and the church was turned into a mosque. The castle was again sieged in 1912 by Serbian and Montenegrin troops during the First Balkan War and later in 1939 during the Italian Invasion of Albania. Heavily damaged, the ruined castle was abandoned soon afterward. The castle has a long and complicated history, but it is also linked to a popular local legend. According to an old story, three brothers wanted to build a castle, but the walls kept collapsing. An old man told the brothers that if they wanted the castle to stand, they had to bury alive in the walls whichever of their wives brought them food the next day, but they couldn’t tell them beforehand. The two older brothers broke this promise and told their wives what would happen.  The younger one kept the secret, and his wife, Rozafa, brought the food. After learning the story, Rozafa accepted immurement, but only if part of her body remained free enough to comfort her infant son.

Today, around 230 of them remain across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Among the ones built in the Balkan Peninsula, the largest was in the ancient city of Dyrrachium, now Durrës, in Albania. The amphitheater in Durrës was built in this flourishing town in the early second century during the reign of Trajan. When filled, it could hold over 20,000 people. The amphitheater was used until the fourth century when a large earthquake damaged the structure. Soon after it was abandoned and a small Christian chapel decorated with frescoes and mosaics was built inside. Another chapel was built in the 13th century but when Albania was conquered by the Ottomans in the 16th century, the whole structure was covered and houses were built above the site. In the 1960s, the Roman amphitheater was rediscovered and partially excavated. More of the structure was excavated in the 1980s, but once exposed to the elements the ancient structure was in danger of being lost forever. In 2004, a massive restoration project saved the monument by turning it into a museum. But it continues to be listed as an endangered cultural site, with many houses still really close and above the old amphitheater.

Built on the mountainside with fantastic views from the windows, the house reflects the architectural style of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled Albania for most of the period between the late 14th and early 20th centuries. The ground floor contained a stable for animals and a workshop where tools were sharpened, olive oil was made, and flour was ground. Traditional wool hats crafted by hand, as well as pottery were all created on the ground floor. It was safer during the period to have everything under one roof rather than a separate barn for animals and supplies. The main family rooms are upstairs, and usually, a ladder was the main way to get inside. It could be pulled up quickly for safety in case of attackers, thieves, or maybe an Ottoman invasion. Upstairs are rooms dedicated to women and men featuring clothing, elaborate frescoes, and weapons. In total, the house plays host to 15 rooms, all of which highlight life in the town of Kruja and its history. There was also a sauna-like bath in the house that could be enjoyed by residents and guests.  There's an option to grab a paper English translation that will tell you the important facts about the rooms you explore to be returned at the end of your visit. If you just take a bus to Krujë you will find the museum.

99,House of Leaves,"Tirana, Albania",A museum dedicated to secret surveillance.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-leaves,"The House of Leaves is a two-story house in the heart of Tirana that derives its name from the fact that it is indeed covered with the leaves of plants clambering over its façade. The construction of the building was completed in 1931, and it exhibits architectural sensitivities that are characteristic of that time. This house, however, is more widely known as being the headquarters of the Albanian secret surveillance apparatus throughout the Cold War, the infamous Sigurimi. Originally, the building did what it was meant to do, which was housing the first obstetrics clinic in Albania. Its purpose changed abruptly when German forces occupied Albania in 1943, and the German secret police, the Gestapo, requisitioned the building to turn it into the headquarters of their operations in the country. This new phase came to an end the following year, when Albanian partisans repelled the German forces and regained independence. The newly constituted People’s Republic of Albania, headed by Enver Hoxha, was in essence a Stalinist state that focused on self-reliance and national unity above everything else. Political dissent was inimical to this endeavor, and as such, it had to be squashed. This was the raison d’être of the Directorate of State Security, the Sigurimi. The building that housed an obstetrics clinic and the Gestapo would become the headquarters of the Sigurimi until the collapse of the communist regime in 1991. It was not until 2017 that the House of Leaves was turned into a museum and opened to the public. Wandering through the 31 rooms of the museum means uncovering the surveillance and interrogation techniques that the regime deployed against its own citizens. One of the Sigurimi’s main functions was the purging of ideological incorrectness from the whole Albanian citizenry in general, and from the Socialist Party in particular. The mention of the House of Leaves would instill a sense of dread in each and every Albanian for almost half a century. Hundreds of thousands of people were spied on, and those that expressed thoughts or ideas that were deemed ideologically suspect ended up in prison or dead. In addition to countless surveillance devices, the museum showcases scores of original documents detailing the secret workings of the Sigurimi. The interrogation rooms are equipped with visual aid that shows how prisoners were “persuaded” to confess through the use of physical violence. Unsurprising, there is also a darkroom for processing photographic film, and a lab for analyzing fingerprints and identifying traces of dangerous chemicals. The garden has some art installations, and the entrance to an underground tunnel protected by thick, concrete doors.  The museum is open Monday to Sunday from 9am to 7pm.",spycraft cold war museums

Bush. His sleeves are rolled-up and he gives a casual wave to onlookers. Bush was the first president of the United States to set foot in post-communist Albania and certainly the first to grace this tiny town with his political presence. Albanians were pro-American long before Bush came to visit in 2007. During the late 1990s, Serbia began an ethnic cleansing of all Albanians in Kosovo, which had been made an autonomous part of Serbia in 1946. NATO sanctioned the bombing of Serbia for 11 weeks in 1999 in retaliation. The move was successful in getting Serbian dictator Slodoban Milošević to cease his persecution of Albanians. The U.S. was also responsible for ending the country’s Cold War isolation. In 2003, Albania sent 70 troops to join the U.S. invasion of Iraq to show their support. So it’s no wonder this statue graces the newly named George W. Bush square in Fushë Kruje.

Some are derelict and disintegrating, while others have been restored to accommodate museums, cafes, hamburger joints, and tattoo parlors.  Made of cement, iron, and steel, Albanian bunkers were built to last—and last they did. It is estimated that between 1967 and 1986, totalitarian prime minister Enver Hoxha oversaw the construction of more than 700,000 bunkers scattered throughout Albania, many of them clustered along its land borders and coastline. They still dot the country’s surface. At the Big Bunker in the scenic Llogara pass, visitors can get up close to this history while enjoying a spectacular ocean view. Three types of bunkers were built during Hoxha’s reign: the three-meter-wide Qender Zjarri, intended as a firing position; the eight-meter-wide Pike Zjarri, built for the purpose of controlling and commanding; and larger structures that often accommodated tunnels. The Big Bunker, true to its name, belongs to the less common third type. The Big Bunker is a compound strategically located on a slope of the Ceraunian Mountains that faces the Adriatic Sea. At an elevation of more than 2,000 feet, it offers the perfect vantage point for spotting ships, probably because Hoxha feared that Italy would invade Albania by sea. A dilapidated three-story building makes up the Bunker’s main structure on a particularly scenic hairpin turn of the road. The floors of this building are covered with rubble and broken glass, and the stairs to access the upper floors are in a dangerous state of disrepair. Looking down towards the sea for approximately 100 feet, one can spot the Bunker’s large concrete tunnel protruding from the slope of the mountain. A couple of goat trails lead to the opening. The tunnel is empty, even though it looks as if it was built to accommodate some large equipment. At the bottom, the tunnel branches off in different directions, a common characteristic of these bunkers. The tunnel, like the rest of the site, boasts a stunning view of the coast, its green and blue sprinkled with cement.  The Big Bunker is located on a windy mountain road. Visitors say beware of car engines overheating on the snaking road during hot days. Expect debris and broken glass at the site, don't wear sandals, and bring a flashlight for some help exploring the bunker. The site is not wheelchair accessible, but one can drive there for a quick stop and enjoy the view.",communist architecture bunkers

A place that housed mostly political prisoners, it stands as a grim reminder of the brutal treatment prisoners endured while incarcerated under the dictatorship of Enver Hoxha. Prisoners were subjected to forced labor in nearby mines and were held in small cells that still bear their memories—names, words, and drawings are etched into the concrete walls of the cells. The prison is so notorious that it has become a metaphor. Sometimes if an Albanian refers to being held in Spaç, they don’t necessarily mean the prison, it’s a term used for anyone who endured punishment from the judicial system. Currently, the prison stands in ruin. In 2013, plans were drafted to convert the site into a museum, however, no progress was ever made. However, in 2019, the Albanian organization Cultural Heritage Without Borders, with the assistance of a team from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, captured 3D images of the site and made a freely accessible digital reconstruction of the prison.

Apart from the occasional restaurant, no other buildings can be found along the way. This is a road that was made for one reason only, namely to lead to the shrine known as Sari Salltik. To avoid confusion, Sari Salltik is a religious figure from the 13th century, but it is also the name of a shrine in honor of Sari Salltik. Much in the way of historical information about Sari Salltik is missing, inaccurate, or unreliable. For example, his date of birth is not known, and his place of birth is contested. According to different sources, he is believed to have been from modern-day Uzbekistan or Crimea. The ancient Turkic books by the name of Oğuzname report that in 1261, Sari Salltik was in the Romanian region of Dobruja, but with contradictory information regarding the political status of the region. Even his death is not devoid of mystery. It is known that Sari Salltik died in the Romanian town of Babadag either in 1297 or in 1298, and his remains were placed in seven coffins. Nowadays, the shrine in Kruje is only one of several locations that claim to be his final burial place. The Sari Salltik shrine is located in a cave not far from where the road ends. A steep set of stairs leads to a landing where a bust of Sari Salltik is located. Facing the bust is a metal structure with chains and hooks used for animal sacrifice. To the far end of the landing is a fountain in the shape of a ram. Inside the cave, there is a small hexagonal shrine and the tomb of Sari Salltik, alongside tombs of other prominent religious figures from the area.  The stairs continue deeper into the cave. At the very bottom, an opening leads to a shaft where devotional candles and coffee cups can be found. The view of Kruje and the valley from the shrine is breathtaking. In favorable weather conditions, it is possible to see as far as the Adriatic Sea.  For the more outdoorsy types, Sari Salltik can be reached from Kruje by following a mountain trail that is rumored to have been used by none other than the Albanian national hero Scanderbeg to bring supplies to Kruje Castle.",shrine islam religion history

The road cuts through a charming pine forest that is also home to several hiking trails and a couple of bunkers. Pass the tiny village of Zvërnec, the road comes to an end, and this is where the wooden bridge that goes to the island is located. Maps refer to the place as Zvërnec Islands, as there are indeed two islands in the Narta Lagoon. The wooden bridge leads to the bigger island, which is also the place of a medieval Byzantine monastery. This island measures 1,400 feet by less than 1,000 feet and reaches a humble elevation of 100 feet. Apart from the clearing with the monastery, the island is covered with pine trees. The smaller of the Zvërnec Islands only has pine trees on it and can only be reached by boat. The monastery is usually referred to as St. Mary’s Monastery (in Albanian, Manastiri i Shën Mërisë), but its full name is Monastery of Dormition of Theotokos Mary. This appellation refers to the last night of St. Mary on earth before being summoned to heaven—the term “theotokos” is a title that can be translated as “mother of god” or “bearer of god.” Constructed during the 13th century, the church of the monastery is one of 200 religious buildings that Albania has recognized as a “culture monument.” The architecture of the building is quintessentially Byzantine, including the cross-shaped plan of the church, which, in this case, has a sarcophagus at its very center. One of the most prized items in the monastery is an icon of St. Mary that was created by Tërpo Zografi, a famous Albanian artist of the 18th century. In addition to the church, the compound includes a smaller chapel, the monks’ dormitories, a workshop, a stable, a warehouse, a football pitch, and a tiny cemetery.

The older quarter of the city is a treasure trove of picture-perfect historical buildings, but one stands out from this multitude: Zekate House. At the beginning of the 19th century, Gjirokastër was part of Rumelia, territories in southeastern Europe belonging to the Ottoman Empire. Rumelia was divided into different administrative units, each ruled by a pasha. Gjirokastër was part of a unit ruled by Ali Pasha, a political figure remembered for both his diplomatic skills and the atrocities committed under his name. Ali Pasha would crack down on dissenting entities with ferocity and rewarded loyalty handsomely. One example of Ali Pasha’s generosity towards his allies was the construction of a stately tower house in Gjirokastër, which he eventually gifted to the administrator of the town, Beqir Zeko. The name of the house, Zekate, is an adjective form of the family name Zeko.  Built between 1811 and 1812 using stones and timber from the region, this structure is considered an outstanding example of Ottoman architecture in Albania. Zekate House consists of four floors, reachable through a set of wooden stairs. The ground floor, known as katoqi, was designated for the storage of foodstuff, firewood, and all cooking utensils. The first floor was where women spent most of their time, and a large room with a sofa suggests that this may have been the equivalent of a living room. The second floor is where the bedrooms are located, with a fireplace, rudimentary toilets, and a hammam. Finally, the top floor consists of three large rooms, two with large windows to combat the heat of the summer weather, and one with fewer, smaller windows and a sizable fireplace suitable for the winter weather. The audience room between the two towers is particularly remarkable. It is painted with colorful floral patterns and its tinted windows add to the cheerfulness of the room. A traditional sofa follows the walls around the room, and a large rug covers the whole floor.  This room opens to a balcony with a commanding view of the Gjirokastër Castle and the Drino Valley. Apart from the stonework, Zakate House is remarkable for the way it managed to preserve the wooden elements of the original structure, including the staircase, built-in wardrobes, lattice woodwork, ceiling, and the intricate structure supporting the roof.",design history & culture architecture

Landmarks such as the pyramid of Tirana still recall darker days. The out-of-place pyramid was built as a museum in honor of Enver Hoxha, a former Albanian leader who furthered the ideals of Stalinism for decades after the Russian dictator died. Designed by Hoxha’s daughter and son-in-law to keep the leader’s legacy alive, earning it the informal name, “The Enver Hoxha Mausoleum.” The museum retained its original purpose until 1991, and as national attitudes began to change, space was converted to a convention center in the first shift in the purpose that would eventually lead to its downfall. As the central purpose of the marble-tile-covered structure shifted from museum to convention center to military staging area to television station, the revolving ownership led to massive neglect. Combined with the unpopular Communist legacy associated with its construction, the building began being looted for materials and covered in graffiti, leading to its current state of dilapidation. While the Pyramid of Tirana is not completely disused (there is still an independent Albanian broadcast company operating there), the government is trying to vote the site into demolition. However, the vote is being contested by locals who would like to see the piece of their heritage (however dark) preserved. Update as of March 2021: Access to the Pyramid of Tirana is not possible.

110,St. George Icon Museum,"Ordino, Andorra",Extensive Orthodox icon collection in Andorra.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-george-icon-museum,"Andorra, a remote European microstate situated between Spain and France in the eastern Pyrenees mountains, has strong historic ties to the Catholic Church. Tradition holds that Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the Moors. Today, the Catalan Bishop holds the (largely ceremonial) post of co-prince. The population of Andorra (roughly 83,000) is predominantly Roman Catholic. The official language is Catalan, although Spanish, French, and Portuguese are also commonly spoken. Considering its strong Catholic identity, it is surprising to find an extensive Eastern Orthodox icon collection in Andorra. Andorra’s remoteness has left it free of external influence, outside of France and Spain, its two immediate neighbors. The only tenuous connection between Andorra and Eastern Orthodoxy was the rule of Boris Skossyreff, a White Russian émigré. Skossyreff proclaimed himself King Boris I of Andorra in 1934. His reign lasted six days, until he was arrested and deported by Spanish authorities. The town of Ordino is home to the St. George’s Museum (Museu Sant Jordi). It is one of three Western museums that focus specifically on iconography. The museum started out as a private collection, but is now open to the public. It houses Orthodox icons from Ukraine, Russia, Greece, and Bulgaria from the 14th to 19th centuries. Approximately 100 icons are on display in three galleries. The icons include images of the Virgin, St. George, and other saints. The collection also includes 70 polychrome wood statues of Christ from Spanish schools in the 11th to 19th centuries. The museum contains a documentary library, as well as an audiovisual exhibition highlighting the places of origin of icons in the collection and the main cathedrals of the Orthodox Church.

To get to the bottom of the gorge’s breathtaking vertical cliffs visitors must walk or take a car, as the local buses in the area do not make trips down there. The cliffs themselves are extremely beautiful, consisting mainly of well-preserved basalt columns. The orderly pentagonal columns look almost man-made and are called the “Symphony of Stones” by locals. On a prominent part of the gorge, an old temple, known as the Garni Temple, can be seen. The temple dates back to first century AD and has been fantastically preserved. It is believed to have been funded by Roman Emperor Nero and is perhaps the eastern-most Greco-Roman temple in the world. The temple was originally erected for the worship of the Greek gods although this changed after Armenia adopted Christianity in 301 AD. Along the gorge, one can also find an 11th century bridge built over what is today a small stream.

Led by Gregory the Illuminator who baptized the Armenian royal family in 301, the nation plunged into religion, collecting artifacts and building spectacular monasteries along the way. The Geghard Monastery began only as a small cave chapel, which Gregory declared held a sacred spring in the 4th century. From there, the complex grew, becoming more ornate and massive. In 1215, the main and most prominent chapel was built. Partially carved out of the rocks on all sides of it, the stone monastery melds beautifully with its surroundings and stands out among the outcroppings above. All told, the buildings comprising the complex are a mix of elegant Armenian stonework and carved crosses juxtaposed with bare cave chapels. The mix gives the complex a feeling of antiquity, especially when combined with the relics the area once held. Geghard is a derivative of an Armenian word meaning Monastery of the Spear. The complex was named after the spear used to wound Jesus during the Crucifixion. Allegedly, the spear was brought to Armenia after the Crucifixion and is now housed in the Echmiadzin Treasury, in the spiritual center of Armenia. Inside the rock-cut Avazan Chapel, there is a holy spring that runs into the monastery. Visitors come to drink from the spring, lining up to fill bottles from home to take the holy water with them. Along with the religious importance of the site, the monastery offers stunning views of the Azat River Gorge surrounding the complex.",caves ecosystems sacred spaces

Before attaining sainthood, Grigor Lusavorich was held in a cell at the bottom of pit dug into an Armenian hillock. For 13 years the man survived by being secretly fed by local Christian women. Then, as the story goes, Lusavorich cured the ruler, King Trdat III, of a disease (either madness or more mythically from having the head of a boar) and subsequently converted the monarch to Christianity. As the king went, so went Armenia and soon the country was the first officially Christian nation in the world. After Lusavorich was sainted as Gregory the Illuminator, the hill in which he was held for so many years became a popular holy site. The first church sites were constructed on the lone elevation beginning in 642, and have been repeatedly rebuilt since. The iconic Surp Astvatsatsin Church which stands on the site today dates from the 17th century. Despite centuries of architectural turmoil, the pit where Saint Gregory was incarcerated can still be visited through the hole to the right of the altar in the St. Gevorg Chapel. The cell is located at the bottom of a claustrophobic, and clammy 200-foot descent by ladder. The dungeon itself is a wide circular room about 14-feet wide and is outfitted to look like it might have when St. Gregory was held there. Khor Virap Monastery continues to be a holy site of the Armenian Apostolic Church and an important pilgrimage location which locals often visit for a baptism or after a wedding to perform a “matagh” or “sacrifice,” often of sheep or chicken. The walled, religious complex also stands before the snowcapped flanks of Mount Ararat, offering a spectacular view of the mountain and cutting a striking silhouette in and of itself.

The historic cave village, located on the steep slope of a gorge, is comprised of both natural and manmade caves. At the inhabiting community’s height, some estimates suggest that population grew to as many as 15,000 people. Since many of the dwellings were carved out over and around each other, a complex system of ropes and ladders were required for people to reach many corners of the community. The village even had two churches and three schools. The cave dwellings were inhabited until as late as the 1950s at which point it is said that Soviet officials deemed the caves unfit and uncivilized, forcing the remaining villagers to leave. Today, Old Khndzoresk is frequented mostly by local livestock which graze amongst the caves, some of which have been converted to stables or storage spaces. Visitors are welcome to explore the cave system, but a trip across the gorge is not for the faint of heart. However, making the trip a bit easier if no less harrowing, is a 160-meter long suspension bridge that was built using nothing more than local funds and labor in 2012 and which shakes with every footstep. The new bridge connects Old Khndzoresk and New Khndzoresk, the modern village, bridging Armenia’s history with the present day both figuratively and literally. From Goris take the Stepanakert Road east for approximately 6 km. You will pass under a metal gate which says Welcome to Khndzoresk in Armenian and Russian.

The waterfall was enjoyed much like any other natural attraction until the 1990s, when someone built a small hydroelectric generator nearby and began diverting most of the water from upstream to generate electricity. When visitors would come to witness the falls, they were disappointed to see the diminished flow as the picturesque falls were essentially turned “off.” And so a compromise was reached: For a fee, visitors could have all the water sent to the waterfall and enjoy the full effect once more. This agreement lasted for several years, but many folks were not happy to have to pay to see their old waterfall. In 2017, the Armenian government decided that at least during tourist season, the waterfall should flow uninterrupted and free of charge for much of the day. They set regular opening hours, and now anyone can enjoy the full splendor of the falls—as long as you get there at the right time.

Yet by the time he passed away at the age of 67 he had dug a stunning series of caves beneath their home using nothing but hand tools, instinct, and a tireless work ethic. Levon began chipping away at the earth back in 1985 when his wife requested he build a root cellar beneath their home where she could store potatoes, however once he started, he simply couldn’t stop. Tosya has since said that her husband was motivated by dreams and visions in which a voice told him he must continue carving the cave. He worked every day, often for up to 18 hours with little rest and only his small hand tools to carve the hard rock, shunning traditional support structures or power tools. He included stairs, halls, twists, and multiple rooms going as deep as 70 feet beneath the house. He also created small shrines and artistic carvings all throughout the cave system, giving it a properly sacred feel. In 2008 Levon passed away, still planning on working on expanding the caves. Today the widow Tosya runs a small museum devoted to his efforts out of their home and gives tours of the strange caves her husband created. A small room now acts as a makeshift museum, displaying artifacts, pictures, and publications dedicated to Levon’s life of devotion to the cave. On the tour, his wife also notes one particular point in the cave which her husband claimed had special magnetic properties. The late Levon’s devotion to creation and stonework is also reflected in the stone mosaic portraits he embedded in the courtyard walls around his home, which in retrospect was also the man’s greatest work.

The 1,000-year-old, dramatically situated Tatev monastery was a great center of science and philosophy in the medieval era, as typified by the Gavazan and other structures within the complex. The site, overlooking the the Vorotan river gorge, was originally used for pagan worship, until the first church was built there sometime between 895 and 906, dedicated to the saints Paul and Peter. It was the bishopric seat of the Syunik region and wielded considerable influence. With the construction of another shrine, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, in the 11th century, the monastery entered a golden period, with nearly 1,000 monks and artisans making it their home. Its library housed more than 10,000 manuscripts. Unfortunately, both the books and this period of prosperity met their end with the invasion of the Seljuk Turks in 1170. The manuscripts had been sent to a fort for safekeeping but the fort was razed to the ground, and the monastery itself was ransacked and looted. It was slowly reconstructed and academic recovery took place in the 14th and 15th centuries when the Tatev University was established and became a key Armenian center for learning, under the leadership of Grigor Tatevatsi. With three different schools, disciplines like architecture, philosophy, and astronomy were taught. The entire compound was self-sufficient with its own oil press, flour mill, and nearby orchards and vineyards in the Vorotan gorge. This period ended when Timur the Lame, and his son launched successive military campaigns in the region. Across the following centuries, the stone complex was battered by invasions and an earthquake that struck in 1931. Efforts were made to partially rebuild the key structures and there’s an ongoing project to restore the extraordinary monastery to its former glory. Visitors can ride on the Wings of Tatev, the world’s longest nonstop double track cable car, that takes you from Halidzor village to the monastery, offering a stunning bird’s-eye view of the gorge. The Gavazan column still stands at the monastery, though it no longer tilts when tremors hit.

First investigated by archaeologists in 2007, the ever-giving Areni caves consist of a number of burial sites dating back to 5000 - 4000 B.C. The miraculous finds began almost as soon as digging begun. Among the artifacts the Armenian-Irish excavation team discovered were a series of clay pots, each containing the skull of a pre-teen corpse. Remarkably, one of these skulls still held a piece of well-preserved brain tissue, making it the oldest example of the Neolithic brain ever discovered. But the amazing finds didn’t stop there. In 2010, excavators discovered a sewn leather shoe dating back to the Copper Age. While sandals and other primitive footwear have been discovered from era’s farther back, the foot wrap is the oldest example of its kind in existence. Shortly after finding the ancient footwear, the researchers then discovered what seemed to be an ancient wine press. The wine-making site is, unsurprisingly, also the earliest proof of wine-making ever found. Tying all of these discoveries together, the archaeologists have theorized that since the wine was likely made by stepping barefoot on the grapes, the leftover shoe was a result of this, and the winery’s proximity to the burial site in turn lead them to believe that the libation had a sacred component to it. Although it is clearly a practice unrelated to Christianity’s similar penchant for vino. Tours of the caves are available for anyone with a diehard interest in Copper Age innovation or shoes. Searching continues at Areni-1 and given enough time it’s possible that researchers can discover even more ancestral relics of the modern world.",world's oldest wine burial places caves archaeology ecosystems

The cableway soars over the deep Vorotan River Gorge, offering breathtaking views of the landscape as you approach the monastery, which sits perched on a large plateau at the edge of a cliff over the stunning gorge.

122,Sevanavank,"Sevan, Armenia",This ancient monastery complex was transformed from an island to a peninsula when the lake was partially drained.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sevanavank,"The monastery complex of Sevanavank is surrounded by such arresting natural beauty it’s no wonder there are two local legends attached to it. The black-and-orange stone construction of the churches is offset by the ornate orange and green andesite and limestone khachkars, stone blocks with intricate designs carved into them. The sparkling azure lake creates a breathtaking backdrop. The complex dates back to the 4th century CE. Soon after St. Gregory the Illuminator converted the King of Armenia to Christianity in 301, he established two churches on an island in Lake Sevan. St. Harutiun’s church, which now lays in ruins, was a domed basilica with three naves, a popular Armenian design. St. Karapet’s, with a similar design, is still standing. In the 9th century, Princess Mariam of the Bagratumi dynasty established St. Arakelots church, the church of the apostles, and St. Astvatsatsin’s church on the island, as well as expanding and rebuilding the existing complex. According to legend, Princess Mariam embarked on a mission to build 30 churches in honor of her late husband after his untimely death. She chose the location of Lake Sevan after she had a dream where the 12 apostles flew across the lake and showed her where she should build. Local legend also tells of how Lake Sevan got its name. Ashot II, also known as Ashot Yerkat or “Ashot the Iron,” camped on the island while fighting off Arab invaders in the 10th century. Despite local monks and fishermen joining his forces, the Armenian army was far outnumbered by the Arabs. A local fisherman advised that their best chance was to sail across the lake and attack at dawn, with the rising sun at their backs. The Arabs were blinded by the sun and the Armenians won the battle. The uniforms and blood of the fallen soldiers turned the lake black, giving it its name, “Sev,” the Armenian word for “black.” In the 1800s the monastery complex was used as a rehabilitation center for misbehaving monks. French explorer Jean-Marie Chopin reported in the 1830s that the monks endured a strict discipline regimen including a diet without meat or wine. No women or youth were allowed on the island. A later visitor noted that the monks copied bibles by hand. No mention is made if they were allowed to participate in the water sports that make the area such a popular tourist attraction today. The island became a peninsula during the industrialization of the 1930s when 65 feet of water was drained from the lake. The monastery was abandoned during the Soviet era and restored in the 1990s as a historic monument. The peninsula now features the Armenian writer’s residence and the Armenian president’s summer palace. Although it hasn’t been an island for about 80 years now, Armenians still call it kghzi, or island.  The monastery is easily accessible by train or car, and located only 45-minute drive north of the capital, Yerevan. The buildings were restored in the 1990s and are now open to the public.

123,The Matenadaran,"Yerevan, Armenia",This medieval manuscript collection has some of the most obscure and ancient texts in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/matenadaran-mesrop-mashtots-institute-of-ancient-manuscripts,"Armenia has had a rich tradition of scriptoriums for over a millennium. Throughout the Middle Ages, very active scriptoriums were found in towns near the shores of the Mediterranean, on Lake Van, in Jugha, Tatev, and many other spots. The illustrated manuscripts were especially valued, as they were painted in actual gold or silver. Unfortunately, Armenia also has a long history of being invaded, and has seen its libraries plundered and burned too many times. Tired of this, in 1959 the Soviet Armenian government decided to step in and build a massive fortress on a hill in the center of the capital, with storage deep in the earth, and gather as many manuscripts as it could there for safekeeping. Thus, the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts was born. The name being cumbersome, it’s been popularly called the Matenadaran ever since, which is a combination of the Armenian words for “parchment” and “repository.” Outside the building stands a statue of the institute’s namesake, Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. With over 23,000 manuscripts and 500,000 additional documents, some of the most obscure and ancient texts from the early medieval age can be found at the Matenadaran. There is a 9th-century gospel, and the ivory-carved cover of a 6th-century gospel as well. The Vehamor Gospel, probably dating to the 7th century, is the oldest-known complete Armenian manuscript in the world. There are manuscripts in other languages, from Greek to Ethiopian, and some works by renowned foreign authors that were almost lost to history, and only saved by their Armenian translations at the Matenadaran.  Most of the works in the vast collection are only accessible by researchers, but the display rooms feature a stunning array of hand-chosen manuscripts that give an excellent glimpse into the rest of the collection.",manuscripts archive repositories of knowledge libraries books medieval collections

In commemoration, it was given a gift of 39 giant, carved Armenian letters, strategically placed near the final resting place of the man who created the alphabet, Mesrop Mashtots. When Mashtots began working on an Armenian alphabet, it was under great pressure so that it could be used to create a bible for the newly Christian kingdom. Elegantly planned, Mashtots laid out the structure of the alphabet around the religion. He made the first letter A, which was the first letter in the word Astvats, or God, and the last letter K’, which began the word K’ristos, Christ. He then put the finishing touches on the last 34 letters and his system has been used ever since, aside from the addition of 3 more letters. To honor his work, Armenian architect J. Torosyan created the stone carvings of every letter near Mashtots’ final resting place in 2005. Set against the backdrop of Armenia’s Mt. Aragats, the letters and a statue of Mashtots pay tribute to the complex and unique language, a national point of pride of Armenia.",outsider architecture monuments statues

The first time the church was lost was in 1695, when a three-nave tuff stone basilica named the Katoghike Church was constructed attached to the western side of the original medieval church. In time, the old church became fully incorporated into the new basilica, and eventually, the little historic gem inside the complex was forgotten entirely. Centuries later, in 1936, the Soviet government ordered the demolition of the basilica, and in the process the 13th-century church was uncovered. Protests by the public and archaeologists led authorities to reverse course and allow the original structure to be preserved near a prominent corner of Yerevan. Further research revealed that it was originally called St. Atsvatsatsin Church and is one of the few structures to survive the major earthquake that devasted the city in the 17th century, making it likely the oldest surviving church in the Armenian capital. The Soviet authorities still, however, did not like the idea of this highly visible house of God, and so they built a linguistics institute wrapping around it, completely obscuring the little church from view, despite being situated at the corner of two busy streets. For decades it sat ignored and forgotten, hidden from the city life happening just a few feet away. With the collapse of the USSR and the end of the restrictions on religion, the medieval church was rediscovered—again—and reopened, retaining the name Katoghike Church. Eventually, the linguistics institute that had encased the church was demolished, and today the 13th-century structure is surrounded by a park and once again prominently visible to all who pass by, if somewhat overshadowed by the larger, modern church of St Anna that was later built right behind it.  The historic Katoghike Church (the full name is Holy Mother of God Katoghike Church) is located along the busy Abovyan Street at the intersection of Sayat-Nova Avenue, about a 15-minute walk from Republic Square.

However it may not be standing today if it were not for the eyes on a representation of God. Built in the 13th century, the monastery is a lovely example of the ornate architecture of the period. The site is comprised of three surviving churches, each decorated in intricate designs and religious reliefs. The sculptor of the grandest portions of Noravank was a man by the name of Momik, who created the lovely stonework that survives today. He also carved a number of uniquely Armenian religious monuments known as “khachkars” which usually depicted an image of a cross surmounting a circular symbol. The sculptor is also buried in a simple grave at the site. However for all of its crumbling historic beauty, Noravank almost didn’t make it out of the Middle Ages. When the Mongols conquered Armenia in the 13th century they set about sacking many of the historic temples of the country. According to tour guides at the monastery, Noravank was spared this fate thanks to a relief of God himself, depicted with large almond-shaped eyes. This appeasement to the Mongols’ phenotypically Asiatic heritage, seemed to calm the horde enough to leave Noravank be. And it’s a good thing too since the existing ruins of the churches are one of the most lovely historic sites in modern Armenia.

The first section of the monastery was built in 1171, and several additions and restorations followed. The central section of the monastery was built in 1279 and holy spring water flows through it. Other parts of the complex include three churches, a mausoleum, a refectory, several chapels, and the cloister. The inscriptions at the entrance are in ancient Georgian, and so is the style of the frescoes. The inscriptions credit Princess Mariam Kyurikid for the construction of the monastery, and records show that its ownership eventually passed to a noble family by the name of Mikhargrdzelis. Several members of this family are buried in the mausoleum at the site. The name of the monastery is an interesting reflection on the history of the monastery, as it means cave-cave in two languages. Kob means cave in Georgian, and ayr means cave in Armenian. Coming from Tumanyan, there is a trail that leads to Kobayr Monastery about 330 feet (100 meters) before reaching the train station at the small village of Kober. It takes about 10 minutes to climb to the top. Theoretically, all parts of the monastery can be accessed, but the terrain and level of disintegration make some parts difficult or dangerous to reach. Renovation work is ongoing.",monasteries medieval sacred spaces ruins history architecture
128,Ani Overlook,"Kharkov, Armenia",The observation point offers spectacular views of the ruins of an ancient Armenian capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ani-overlook,"More than 1,000 years ago, Ani, the former capital of Armenia, was a thriving metropolis of more than 100,000 residents that rivaled the other great cities of the world. But after it was attacked by the Mongols in 1236 and further destroyed in an earthquake in 1319, the once-great city slowly fell into ruins. The ruins, with massive ramparts, cathedrals, monasteries, mosques, and bridges, remain a stunning sight to this day. But it hasn’t always been easy to see them. A treaty between the Soviet Union and Turkey handed Ani over to Turkey, and soon after the Cold War made it nearly impossible to see it for many decades. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, it is now possible to see the extensive ruins from either Turkey or Armenia. Though the ruins are in Turkey today, they are right on the border with Armenia, where sweeping views of the entire city are visible. Visiting the Ani overlook from Armenia is not simple, however. The Cold War may be over, but Armenia’s border with Turkey is still guarded by Russian troops, and completely blocked by barbed wire fences, raked sand, and guard towers. However, it’s much easier to visit from Kars in Turkey, with tours organized daily throughout the year.  Remember to take your passport. Permission to visit should be requested a week in advance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Yerevan, and visitors will be escorted by Russian soldiers to the best viewing spot in an experience almost as interesting as the ruins themselves.",borders ghost towns archaeology ruins
129,Byurakan Observatory,"Byurakan, Armenia",Armenia's premier center of astrophysical research was established during the Soviet era.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/byurakan-observatory,"In the small Armenian village of Byurakan, against the backdrop of Mount Aragats, one of the country’s highest spots, several silver domes can be seen shining in the sun. These domes cover the Byurakan Observatory, a premier astronomical center which was established during the Soviet era. The man behind the observatory’s establishment is an Armenian hero, who led many advancements in astrophysics, both in the country and globally: Victor Ambartsumian (also styled Viktor Hambardzumyan). He was one of the earliest to work in the field of theoretical astrophysics and one of its pioneers. The observatory was founded in 1946 and is home to what was for several years the largest telescope in the USSR, a 2.6m Cassegrain reflector. Under Ambartsumian’s leadership, studies at the observatory related to instability phenomena around the universe, which remains the cornerstone of their research program today. Ambartsumian himself lived near the facility and conducted experiments till he passed away in 1996. Armenia has a long history of astronomical study dating back several thousand years and the observatory played a crucial part bringing it into the realm of modern science and study. The campus, owned by the Armenian National Academy of Sciences, was designed by the famous Soviet architect Samvel Safaryan and now houses five large observational instruments. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and maintained, and the observatory hosts guided tours in several languages for a few dollars and also accepts proposals to use its powerful telescopes.",telescopes observatories astronomy villages soviet history
130,Khachkars,"Noratus, Armenia",Hundreds of intricately carved Armenian stone crosses can be found within this huge cemetery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/noratus-cemetery-khachkars,"The carving of khachkars, literally meaning “cross-stones,” is an ancient Armenian art. It began with a simple cross depicted on a stone, usually a tombstone or memorial, and eventually evolved into very intricate knotwork patterns covering the entire marker. These beautiful stelae, some over a thousand years old, can be found all over historic Armenia and are a symbol of Armenia’s cultural heritage. The largest collection is at the Noratus Cemetery, near the Alpine Lake Sevan, where they line the hill around two simple old chapels, most of them liberally sprinkled with lichens. (There was at one time a much larger khachkar cemetery located in Old Julfa, but that was sadly destroyed over the years by the Soviet, then Azerbaijani governments.) While some of the nearly one thousand khachkars at Noratus Cemetery date back as far as the 10th century, the majority were made in the 1500s and 1600s when three master carvers named Kiram Kazmogh, Arakel, and Meliset were hard at work. Aside from the elaborate patterns, the stones at Noratus depict saints, angels, wedding scenes, men riding horses, and scenes from life at the time. In 1977, the head of the Armenian Church donated one of the khachkars to the British Museum, so you don’t necessarily have to make it all the way to the shores of Lake Sevan to see one of these beauties.  The cemetery is located just over a mile from the main road, open 24 hours. Give yourself plenty of time to wander around and admire these wonderful works of art.",crosses culture graves gravestones ancient cemeteries art
131,Sergei Parajanov Museum,"Yerevan, Armenia","Despite producing just a handful of movies, a brave and lyrical filmmaker has an entire museum dedicated to him.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sergei-parajanov-museum,"Armenian filmmaker Sergei Parajanov (1924-1990), born in Tblisi, Georgia (then part of the USSR), came to international prominence with a film he made in Ukraine called Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors. World renowned for his performance in the foreign film, back in his native Soviet Union he was honored by being banned from making films. After this, he moved to Yerevan in Armenia (still part of the Soviet Union) and made a film called The Color of Pomegranates. Without words or much camera movement, it told the story of a revered Armenian poet. This movie was equally acclaimed as a masterpiece and this time Parajanov was rewarded by being banned from filmmaking and eventually thrown in jail for five years. The current museum in Yerevan that is dedicated to the actor celebrates his resolute refusal to stop creating. There are amazing displays of playing cards and artworks handmade by Parajanov in prison as well as other beautiful collages from a time when he was banned from filmmaking. The museum is filled with artifacts that whether or not visitors love, absolutely display Parajanov’s passion and joy. There are also images from sets and recreated rooms of his flat in Tblisi. While Parajanov may seem like an esoteric subject for his own museum, there may be no finer example of the geographic fluidity and complexity of the Armenian diaspora than an Armenian filmmaker born in what is now Georgia, and who made major films in what is now the Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, and whose museum is in the capital of a sovereign Armenia. The Museum is very well known locally. However, the museum is on small street just off a main drag, so, unless your Armenian is splendid, be sure you have a clear idea of where you are going. And remember: all Armenian names on this page (including street names) are written in an anglicized script, but if you can show a good samaritan the picture of the plaque, they'll probably know exactly where you should go.",repositories of knowledge film collections museums and collections museums

Some of the stones are pierced with a circular hole through which observers can see the sky and the stars. The Zorats Karer, also called Karahunj or Carahunge, consists of 223 stones in total, arranged in a circle flanked by northern and southern arms. It has been dated to the Middle Bronze Age or possibly the Iron Age. Though its purpose remains unknown, several astronomers have suggested the site is an ancient astronomical observatory due to the circular holes that were bored into several of the standing stones. An alternative theory is that the stones are what remains of the walls of an ancient Armenian city.

As you drive through town and up the hill toward Tegheri Vank, a beautiful black stone, 13th century monastery, you will see a site known as Crystals of Refrain, one of the most elaborate installations in a long-running art project known as Kcymaerxthaere. The work of artist Eames Demetrios, Kcymaerxthaere comprises a series of plaques and other markers around the world. Each of these markers honors an event that took place in a parallel universe, which, according to Demetrios, “co-exists to some degree with ours.” Most of the installations are bronze or stone plaques inscribed with stories but some are larger, even entire buildings. As of 2021, there are more than 140 sites spread across six continents and 30 countries. According to the project’s lore, it was at this site that a Kcymaerxthaereal woman named Eliala Me-Ning saved a child known as the Boy from the Sea. A total of six sets of stones tell you the story of Eliala, a singer who had witnessed a terrible crime. Though she tried to hide, Eliala’s distinctive voice kept giving her away, so she lived a life on the run. Eventually she ended up staying with a community by the gorge here. When a flash flood raced through the gorge, putting a young boy in danger. Eliala sang so beautifully she crystalized the water into a soft pillowy stone that cushioned his fall. This Kcymaerxthaere site overlooks the village and has a clear view of Mount Ararat (though the peak is often concealed). There are four main elements: an entry stone, the 12 stones with the stories, a spiral of stones, each of which represents one of Eliala Mei-Ning’s places of hiding, and the three red corners, as well as 281 cratered stones.

That is how Mirzoyan Library was born. Mirzoyan decided to rent a space in a historic old courtyard-style house with creaky wooden balconies and stairs—the kind that were once quite common in Yerevan but today are nearly all gone. He frugally furnished the building with old and repurposed furniture to match the setting. Since its opening, the space has proven to be a big hit. It’s an oasis of quiet and art in the bustling city center. Well-known photographers have visited the library and had exhibitions there. They and others have helped expand the book collection so it now includes more than 600 books. The collection became so large the library had to expand into another space in the courtyard below.  The library is free to use, but books cannot leave the premises. The space also doubles as a small cafe.",repositories of knowledge photography libraries books

Arytom and Anastas Mikoyan were born ten years apart from one another around the turn of the century and both went on to become important figures in the Soviet Union during their lifetimes. The older Anastas, born in 1895 joined the Soviet politburo as a Stalinist supporter and managed to remain in the cabinet (and alive) for a number of years, eventually even outlasting Stalin himself. Arguably more well known, the younger Artyom joined the air force and went on to sign up with the aircraft design division and eventually co-created (along with his partner Mikhail Gurevich, hence the abbreviation) the generation of MiG fighter aircraft which served the Soviet Union and its allies from World War II until the Cold War. Given their prominent roles in Soviet political and military history, a state-sponsored monument to the men was established in their home village that still stands today. The most prominent aspect of the memorial is the sweeping canopy that hangs over a full-size MiG 21. There is also a small museum with pictures and artifacts devoted to their lives and careers nearby staffed by local curators who are more than willing to tell visitors the story behind each piece in the collection, pride for the hometown boys who made a splash on the world stage, beaming from their every anecdote.",aircraft airplanes world war ii military
136,Spider Statue,"Yerevan, Armenia",Destruction from Armenia's 1988 earthquake inspired an artist's sculptures of scrap metal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spider-statue,"Yerevan can surprise the occasional visitor with its abundance of public art. One contemporary example is the spider statue in the city’s Charles Aznavour Square. Dedicated to the French Armenian singer Charles Aznavour, this square boasts a number of landmarks, including the Moscow Cinema, the Stanislavski Russian Theatre, and the giant spider. Upscale and austere, the surrounding buildings contribute to the charm of this work of art. The spider is made of recycled gears, pipes, springs, bolts, and other mechanical items. Ara Alekyan is the artist behind this installation, and he is a master at welding scrap metal together to create something new and exciting. Following the 1988 earthquake that devastated Armenia, Alekyan observed the buildings that collapsed and noticed that the rusted and contorted metal frames created broken and sinuous patterns. He was inspired, and soon afterward, he started experimenting with the medium of discarded metal in his artistic endeavors. Alekyan has a signature way of unveiling his artworks: He sets them on fire. He reasons that iron is born of fire; it is by fire that it is given a certain shape, and it is also by fire that he assembles disparate metal parts into sculptures. It is, therefore, fitting that their new incarnation deserves baptism by fire.",spiders fire metal art outside public art sculptures art
137,Obelisk of Odzun,"Odzun, Armenia",An unusual double-stelae obelisk with ancient and mysterious origins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/obelisk-of-odzun,"Odzun is a small village on the edge of a plateau that drops abruptly into the gorge formed by the Debed river. In addition to breath-taking views of the valley and mountains, Odzun is home to a historic basilica that was founded around 580. Located on the grounds of the basilica is a massive ancient obelisk of mysterious origins. The obelisk consists of two stelae protruding upward from a platform that is framed by two narrow arches. Although the purpose or meaning of the obelisk is still a topic of debate, it bears some resemblance to funerary monuments of the same era. One side is adorned with iconographic carvings portraying scenes from the old and new testament, and the conversion of Armenia to Christianity. On the other side, floral patterns decorate the stelae. One hypothesis regarding the origins of the obelisk dates back to the 4th-century when Hindu and Christian factions clashed. According to historical records, the Christian army prevailed, but both factions fought valiantly and lost prominent figures during the battles. The obelisk is said to honor the bravery of both factions. Many scholars point to a bust of Jesus inside the basilica in support of this hypothesis. The bust is adorned with snakes held in the hands of two angels. The images of Jesus and snakes are unmistakably rooted in biblical writings, but they seldom appear conjointly, especially in medieval Armenian iconography. This anomaly may be explained by the fact that the snake is an object of worship in the Hindu religion, thus connecting the obelisk with 4th-century religious battles. Surrounding the basilica are monuments that are from a more recent chapter in Armenian history. These religious monuments display communist symbols such as the hammer and sickle and the red star.",mystery history & culture architecture
138,Tsaghkunk Restaurant,"Tsaghkunk, Armenia",This modern tandoor eatery was once a canteen for Soviet farmers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tsaghkunk-restaurant,"In the eastern Armenian village of Tsaghkunk, an abandoned canteen for Soviet workers is now serving some of Armenia’s most progressive heritage cuisine. Tsaghkunk Restaurant was once a lunch stop for local growers and cattle farmers. The building sat abandoned for around 40 years, before ex-diplomat and businessman Hrachya Aghajanyan restored it lovingly into a dining room for modern Armenian gastronomy. Prior to the renovation, a three-month excavation of a shack next to the building revealed more than 300 artifacts dating as far back as the 11th century. Two tonirs—ancient tandoor ovens used for making lavash bread, grilling meats and the like—were among them. Both tonirs have been preserved under glass, and are available for guests to peek at, but Aghajanyan decided the restaurant should still be focused on traditional fire cooking nonetheless. Mads Refslund, who co-founded Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant that consistently lands at the top of world’s-best list, partially developed Tsaghkunk Restaurant’s menu. It showcases Armenia’s bountiful pantry of diverse, unique, and often unheard-of produce including herbs such as aveluk (a uniquely Armenian type of wild sorrel), plants like wild chamomile and grain staples such as bulgur and lentils with fish sourced from nearby Lake Sevan and meat grilling. Dishes dreamed up with a New Nordic attention to style and sustainability are served in a bright, open space framed by 200-year-old wood beams and high ceilings, as well as stylish contemporary seating and lamps. Don’t be surprised to meet Aghajanyan here wining and dining out-of-town guests on evenings and weekends. He may travel the world for work, but Aghajanyan grew up visiting his grandparents in Tsaghkunk, a place he will always be deeply connected to.  The restaurant is located about an hour’s drive north of the capital Yerevan.

The fish are caught in nearby Lake Sevan, a vast, freshwater lake at an elevation of 6,200 feet. Passersby stop to see the fish and prices, and occasionally carry a little piscine souvenir from the lake with them as they drive along the interstate. Trout, whitefish, and crabs are typically on offer. When the weather gets unbearably cold, the fish sellers of Tsovagyugh come up with an ingenious fix to continue plying their trade. As the humans take shelter nearby, professional-looking mannequins take their place by the highway. Some of them are dressed in suits, arms spread out just like their human counterparts. One of these mannequins was even spotted dressed in a Santa Claus outfit. The local government has, from time to time, issued a ban on fishing in Lake Sevan to address concerns of overfishing, particularly of the Sevan trout. Local fishermen, who have a long history of making their livelihood from the lake, have protested these bans and the roadside trade of fish-selling has continued with the occasional assistance of a mannequin vendor.  Driving along the M4 highway from the shores of Lake Sevan in the direction of Dilijan, there is a concentration of these fish sellers.
